$100 000/QALY at 11 years and $150 000/QALY at 8 years. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, the shared-incentives intervention was cost-effective in 
69% to 77% of iterations using cost-effectiveness thresholds of $100 000 to 
$150 000/QALY. Cost-effectiveness results were also sensitive to the duration of 
intervention costs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that the financial incentives 
shared between patients and physicians for LDL-C level control meet conventional 
standards of cost-effectiveness, but these results appeared to be sensitive to 
assumptions about the durations of LDL-C level reductions and years of 
intervention costs included, as well as to the choice of time horizon.

IMPORTANCE: Schizophrenia is associated with a reduced life expectancy of 15 to 
20 years owing to a high prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders. Obesity, a key 
risk factor for the development of cardiometabolic alterations, is more 
prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Although obesity is linked to the 
altered reward processing of food cues, no studies have investigated this link 
in schizophrenia without the confounds of antipsychotics and illness chronicity.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate neural responsivity to food cues in first-episode 
psychosis without the confounds of antipsychotic medication or illness 
chronicity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study was conducted from 
January 31, 2015, to September 30, 2018, in London, United Kingdom, of 29 
patients with first-episode psychosis who were not taking antipsychotic 
medication and 28 matched controls.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants completed a food cue paradigm while 
undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Neural activation was 
indexed using the blood oxygen level-dependent hemodynamic response. The Dietary 
Instrument for Nutrition Education was used to measure diet, and the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to measure exercise.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, sex, or body mass index 
between the 29 patients (25 men and 4 women; mean [SD] age, 26.1 [4.8] years) 
and 28 controls (22 men and 6 women; mean [SD] age, 26.4 [5.5] years). Relative 
to controls, patients consumed more saturated fat (t46 = -3.046; P = .004) and 
undertook less high-intensity (U = 304.0; P = .01) and low-intensity (U = 299.5; 
P = .005) weekly exercise. There were no group differences in neural responses 
to food vs nonfood cues in whole-brain or region-of-interest analyses of the 
nucleus accumbens, insula, or hypothalamus. Body mass index was inversely 
correlated with the mean blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the nucleus 
accumbens in response to food vs nonfood cues in controls (R = -0.499; P = .01) 
but not patients (R = 0.082; P = .70).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Relative to controls, patients with first-episode 
psychosis who were not taking antipsychotic medication consumed more saturated 
fat and showed an altered association between body mass index and neural 
response to food cues in the absence of differences in neural responses to food 
cues. These findings highlight how maladaptive eating patterns and alterations 
in the association between body mass index and neural responses to food cues are 
established early in the course of schizophrenia.

IMPORTANCE: Pacific Islanders have among the highest rates of obesity and type 2 
diabetes in the world. Targeting children is critical for primary prevention.
OBJECTIVES: To prevent young child overweight and obesity and to improve health 
in the US-Affiliated Pacific region via the Children's Healthy Living Program.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multijurisdictional, multilevel, 
multicomponent community randomized clinical trial, where all evaluable children 
were analyzed according to the random assignment of their community, 
hierarchical difference-in-difference models accounted for the community 
randomization, community clustering with jurisdictions, and these models were 
adjusted for the age and sex distribution of the community. The setting was 27 
communities in 5 jurisdictions (Alaska, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and Hawaii). Participants were 4329 children 
(time 1) and 4042 children (time 2) aged 2 to 8 years in 27 selected communities 
from October 7, 2012, to October 25, 2015. Data analysis was completed in June 
2018.
INTERVENTIONS: Nineteen activities addressed policy, environment, messaging, 
training, and 6 target behaviors (sleep time, screen time, physical activity, 
fruits and vegetables, water, and sugar-sweetened beverages).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were body size measurements. 
Secondary outcomes were acanthosis nigricans, sleep quality and duration, 
dietary intake, physical activity, and other questionnaire reponses.
RESULTS: The study included 27 communities and 8371 evaluable children (mean 
[SD] age, 5.4 [1.8] years; 50.9% male [n = 4264]). Data analysis included 952 
children in the intervention group and 930 children in the control group aged 2 
to 5 years at time 1; 825 children in the intervention group and 735 children in 
the control group aged 2 to 5 years at time 2; 565 children in the intervention 
group and 561 children in the control group aged 6 to 8 years at time 1; and 517 
children in the intervention group and 560 children in the control group aged 6 
to 8 years at time 2. The intervention communities showed significant 
improvement compared with control communities in overweight and obesity 
prevalence (effect size [d] = -3.95%; 95% CI, -7.47% to -0.43%), waist 
circumference (d = -0.71 cm; 95% CI, -1.37 to -0.05 cm), and acanthosis 
nigricans prevalence (d = -2.28%; 95% CI, -2.77% to -1.57%). Age and sex 
subgroup analysis revealed greater difference among the intervention communities 
in acanthosis nigricans prevalence in the group aged 2 to 5 years (-3.99%) vs 
the group aged 6 to 8 years (-3.40%), and the interaction was significant 
(d = 0.59%, P < .001), as well as the smaller difference in the group aged 2 to 
5 years (-0.10%) vs the group aged 6 to 8 years (-1.07%) in screen time 
(d = -0.97 hour per day, P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The intervention reduced the prevalence of young 
child overweight and obesity and acanthosis nigricans. Comprehensive, effective, 
and sustainable interventions are needed to improve child health in the 
US-Affiliated Pacific region.

IMPORTANCE: Guidelines for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommend an 
individualized approach in older adults that is informed by consideration of 
life expectancy and cancer risk. However, little is known about how patients 
perceive individualized screening recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: To assess veterans' attitudes toward and comfort with cessation of 
low-value CRC screening (defined as screening in a patient for whom the benefit 
is expected to be small based on quantitative estimates from hypothetical risk 
calculators).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study included patients older 
than 50 years who had undergone prior screening colonoscopy with normal results 
at the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System. A total of 1500 surveys 
were mailed to potential participants from November 1, 2010, to January 1, 2012. 
Survey data were analyzed from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Response to the question, "If you personally had 
serious health problems that were likely to shorten your life and your doctor 
did not think screening would be of much benefit based on the calculator, how 
comfortable would you be with not getting any more screening colonoscopies?"
RESULTS: Of the 1500 surveys mailed, 85 were returned to sender, leaving 1415 
potential respondents; 1054 of these respondents (median age range, 60-69 years; 
884 [85.9%] white and 965 [94.2%] male) completed the survey (response rate, 
74.5%). A total of 300 (28.7%) were not at all comfortable with cessation of 
low-value CRC screening, and 509 (49.3%) thought that age should never be used 
to decide when to stop screening. In addition, 332 (31.7%) thought it was not at 
all reasonable to use life expectancy calculators, and 255 (24.3%) thought it 
was not at all reasonable to use CRC risk calculators to guide these decisions. 
In ordered logistic regression analysis, factors associated with more comfort 
with screening cessation were (1) higher trust in physician (odds ratio [OR], 
1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.32), (2) higher perceived health status (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 
1.23-1.61), and (3) higher barriers to screening (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11-1.30). 
Factors that were associated with less comfort with screening cessation included 
(1) greater perceived effectiveness of screening (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94) 
and (2) greater perceived threat of CRC (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that many veterans have strong 
preferences against screening cessation even when given detailed information 
about why the benefit may be low. Efforts to tailor screening recommendations 
may be met by resistance unless they are accompanied by efforts to address 
underlying perceptions about the benefit of screening.

IMPORTANCE: Endorsement of global humanitarian interventions is based on either 
proven cost-effectiveness or perceived public health benefits. The 
cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits of global humanitarian pediatric 
cardiac surgery are unknown, and funding for this intervention is insufficient.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention (multiple 
2-week-long humanitarian pediatric cardiac surgery program assistance trips to 
various low- and middle-income countries [LMICs]) and to produce a measure of 
the long-lasting effects of global humanitarian programs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: International, multicenter cost-effectiveness 
analysis of a cohort of children (aged <16 years) undergoing surgical treatment 
of congenital heart disease during 2015 in LMICs, including China, Macedonia, 
Honduras, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, and Ukraine. The study 
also assessed estimated improvement in the United Nations Human Development 
Indicators (life expectancy, years of schooling, and gross national income) for 
each individual survivor, as a proxy for long-term benefits of the intervention.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness of the 
intervention. The secondary outcomes were potential gains in life expectancy, 
years of schooling, and gross national income per capita for each survivor.
RESULTS: During 2015, 446 patients (192 [43%] female; mean [SD] age, 3.7 [5.4] 
years) were served in 10 LMICs at an overall cost of $3 210 873. Of them, 424 
were children. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was $171 per 
disability-adjusted life-year averted. Each survivor in the cohort (390 of 424) 
potentially gained 39.9 disability-adjusted life-years averted, 3.5 years of 
schooling, and $159 533 in gross national income per capita during his or her 
extended lifetime at purchasing power parity and 3% discounting.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Humanitarian pediatric cardiac surgery in LMICs is 
highly cost-effective. It also leaves behind a lasting humanitarian footprint by 
potentially improving individual development indices.

INTRODUCTION: Over the past 15 years, changes in demographic, social, and 
epidemiologic trends occurred in the United States. These changes likely 
contributed to changes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) epidemiology.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the change in burden of CKD at the US state level from 
2002 to 2016.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This systematic analysis used data and 
methodologies from the 2016 Global Burden of Disease study in the United States. 
Data on CKD from 2002 to 2016 were examined at the state level.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and death due 
to CKD.
RESULTS: In this analysis of data from individuals in the United States, from 
2002 to 2016, CKD DALYs increased by 52.6%, from 1 269 049 DALYs (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI], 1 154 521-1 387 008) to 1 935 954 DALYs (95% UI, 
1 747 356-2 124 795). Death due to CKD increased by 58.3%, from 52 127 deaths 
(95% UI, 51 082-53 076) to 82 539 deaths (95% UI, 80 298-84 652). All states 
exhibited increases in CKD burden, but the rate of change (2002-2016) and the 
burden in 2016 varied by state. States in the southern United States (including 
Mississippi and Louisiana) exhibited more than twice the burden seen in other 
states (eg, the age-standardized CKD DALY rate in Vermont was 321 [95% UI, 
281-363] per 100 000 population, whereas the rate in Mississippi was 697 [95% 
UI, 620-779] per 100 000 population). In the United States, the increase in CKD 
DALYs was attributable to increased risk exposure (40.3%), aging (32.3%), and 
population growth (27.4%). Age-standardized CKD DALY rates increased by 18.6% 
where increases in metabolic, and to a lesser extent dietary, risk factors 
contributed 93.8% and 5.3% of this change, respectively. Chronic kidney disease 
due to diabetes was the primary contributor for the 26.8% increased probability 
of death due to CKD among the population aged 20 to 54 years; among the 
population aged 55 to 89 years, the probability of death due to CKD increased by 
25.6% and was driven by CKD due to diabetes and decreased probability of death 
from causes other than CKD. Improvement in sociodemographic development was 
coupled with an increase in age-standardized CKD DALY rates that occurred at a 
faster pace than that of other noncommunicable diseases in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings revealed that between 2002 and 2016, the 
burden of CKD in the United States appeared to be increasing and variable among 
states. These changes may be associated with increased risk exposure and 
demographic expansion leading to increased probability of death due to CKD, 
especially among young adults. The findings suggest that an effort to target the 
reduction of CKD through greater attention to metabolic and dietary risks, 
especially among younger adults, is necessary.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and progressive disease arising 
from various etiologies and pathogenesis. PAH decreases life expectancy due to 
pulmonary vascular remodeling, elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 
and ultimately progresses to heart failure. While clinical treatments are 
available to reduce the associated symptoms, a complete cure has yet to be 
found. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibition has been identified as a possible 
intervention point in PAH treatment. The functional vasodilation response to 
N²,N⁴-diamino quinazoline analogues with differing PDE-5 inhibitory activities 
and varying physicochemical properties were assessed in both endothelium-intact 
and denuded rat pulmonary arteries to gain greater insight into their mode of 
action. All analogues produced vasorelaxant effects with EC50s ranging from 0.58 
± 0.22 µM to ˃30 µM. It was observed that vasodilation response in intact 
vessels was highly correlated with that of denuded vessels. The ~10% drop in 
activity is consistent with a loss of the nitric oxide mediated cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (NO/cGMP) pathway in the latter case. A moderate correlation 
between the vasodilation response and PDE-5 inhibitory activity in the intact 
vessels was observed. Experimental protocol using the alpha-adrenergic (α₁) 
receptor agonist, phenylephrine (PE), was undertaken to assess whether 
quinazoline derivatives showed competitive behavior similar to the α₁ receptor 
blocker, prazosin, itself a quinazoline derivative, or to the PDE-5 inhibitor, 
sildenafil. Competitive experiments with the α₁-adrenergic receptor agonist 
point to quinazoline derivatives under investigation here act via PDE-5 
inhibition and not the former. The pre-incubation of pulmonary arterial rings 
with quinazoline test compounds (10 μM) reduced the contractile response to PE 
around 40⁻60%. The most promising compound (9) possessed ~32 folds higher 
selectivity in terms of vasodilation to its mammalian A549 cell cytotoxicity. 
This study provides experi0 0mental basis for PDE-5 inhibition as the mode of 
action for vasodilation by N²,N⁴-diamino quinazoline analogues along with their

PURPOSE: Pembrolizumab was recently approved in several countries as a 
first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1 positive, non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). However, it is expensive. This study aimed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab in treating advanced NSCLC patients with 
PD-L1 positive cancer in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
pembrolizumab with chemotherapy for patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 
50% of NSCLC tumor cells. Model inputs for transition probabilities and toxicity 
were derived from published clinical trial data, while health utilities were 
estimated from a literature review. Costs for drugs were updated to standard fee 
data from West China Hospital in 2017. Health outcomes were measured in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness was measured as the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
to test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Pembrolizumab gained 0.45 QALYs at an incremental cost of $46,362 
compared to chemotherapy for an ICER of $103,128 per QALY gained. In most 
scenarios, the ICER exceeded three times the Chinese Gross Domestic Product per 
capita. Two-way sensitivity analysis showed that, when the utility of the 
progression-free status increased to the maximal value of 0.845 and the 1 mg 
dose price decreased to $10.50, the ICER reduced to $25,216/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is not likely to be cost-effective in the treatment 
of PD-L1 positive, NSCLC for Chinese patients. Less aggressive pricing may 
increase accessibility for patients in China.

BACKGROUND: Social isolation potentiates the risk of death by cancer in the 
older cancer patient population. The PREDOMOS study investigates the impact of 
establishing a Program of Social intervention associated with techniques of 
Domotic and Remote assistance on the improvement of quality of life of older 
isolated patients, treated for locally advanced or metastatic cancer. This paper 
updates the pilot trial protocol.
METHODS/DESIGN: The original protocol was published in Trials, accessible at 
https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-017-1894-7 . 
This update reports on the eligibility criteria expansion and on the adjunction 
of a cost-utility analysis. We widened the eligible population to patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic cancer including malignant hemopathies (except 
acute myeloid leukemia) and to patients in the first and second lines of 
oncologic treatment. We restricted the inclusion to patients with a Mini Mental 
State Examination score strictly over 24. In addition to the secondary outcomes 
outlined in the protocol, a medico-economic analysis has been added to evaluate 
both the health benefits and costs of the two strategies and calculate the 
incremental cost-utility ratio of the innovative program assessed, compared to 
the standard practice.

Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug given to patients before and after having a 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Genomic variants in the CYP2C19 gene 
are associated with variable enzyme activities affecting drug metabolism and 
hence, patients with reduced or increased enzymatic function have increased risk 
of bleeding. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare a 
pharmacogenomics versus a non-pharmacogenomics-guided clopidogrel treatment for 
coronary artery syndrome patients undergoing PCI in the Spanish healthcare 
setting. A total of 549 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease followed 
by PCI were recruited. Dual antiplatelet therapy was administrated to all 
patients from 1 to 12 months after PCI. Patients were classified into two 
groups: the Retrospective group was treated with clopidogrel based on the 
clinical routine practice and the Prospective group were initially genotyped for 
the presence of CYP2C19 variant alleles before treatment with those carrying 
more than one CYP2C19 variant alleles given prasugrel treatment. We collected 
data on established clinical and health outcome measures, including, per 
treatment arm: the percentage of patients that suffered from (a) myocardial 
infraction, (b) major bleeding and minor bleeding, (c) stroke, (d) the number of 
hospitalization days, and (e) the number of days patients spent in Intensive 
Care Unit. Our primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis was 
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). To estimate the treatment cost for each 
patient, individual data on its resource used were combined with unit price 
data, obtained from Spanish national sources. The analysis predicts a survival 
of 0.9446 QALYs in the pharmacogenomics arm and 0.9379 QALYs in the 
non-pharmacogenomics arm within a 1-year horizon. The cumulative costs per 
patient were €2971 and €3205 for the Prospective and Retrospective groups, 
respectively. The main cost driver of total cost in both arms was 
hospitalization costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
negative indicating that the PGx was a dominant option. Our data show that 
pharmacogenomics-guided clopidogrel treatment strategy may represent a 
cost-effective choice compared with non-pharmacogenomics-guided strategy for 
patients undergoing PCI.

The pharmacokinetics of many antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or 
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI)) are influenced by the highly 
polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. Therefore, pharmacogenetics could play an important 
role in the treatment of depressive patients. The potential cost-utility of 
screening patients is however still unknown. Therefore, a Markov model was 
developed to compare the strategy of screening for CYP2D6 and subsequently 
adjust antidepressant treatment according to a patient's metabolizer profile of 
poor, extensive, or ultra metabolizer, with the strategy of no screening ('one 
size fits all' principle). Each week a patient had a probability of side 
effects, which was followed by dosage titration or treatment switching. After 6 
weeks treatment effect was evaluated followed by treatment adjustments if 
necessary, with a total time horizon of the model of 12 weeks. The analysis was 
performed from a societal perspective. The strategy of screening compared with 
no screening resulted in incremental costs of €91 (95 percentiles: €39; €152) 
more expensive but also more effect with 0.001 quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) (95 percentiles: 0.001; 0.002) gain. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was therefore €77,406 per QALY gained, but varied between €22,500 
and €377,500 depending on the price of screening and productivity losses. 
According to our model, we cannot unequivocally conclude that screening for 
CYP2D6 in primary care patients using antidepressants is be cost-effective, as 
the results are surrounded by large uncertainty. Therefore, information from 
ongoing studies should be used to reduce these uncertainties.

Despite kidney transplantation (KT) being considered as the best treatment 
modality for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), patient and graft survival in the 
elderly population is poorer than younger individuals. Many authors argue that 
prolonged life expectancy outweighs the risk of remaining on dialysis, but few 
studies had compared the treatment modalities, especially with peritoneal 
dialysis (PD). A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care institute 
to compare outcome of elderly ESRD patients, who received KT with those 
continued on PD; and to evaluate the predictors of patient survival. Patient 
survival at 1 year was (76.2% vs. 91.1%); 5 years (53.7% vs. 21.8%); and 10 
years (35.6% vs. 0.00%) among KT and PD population, respectively. Infection was 
the most common cause of death among KT group (35 [41.2%] vs. 34 [28.2%]) while 
cardiovascular mortality in PD group (55 [46.2%] vs. 7 [8.2%]). Technique 
survival at 1, 5, and 10 years in PD group was 92.8%, 58.5%, and 0%, 
respectively. Similarly, graft survival at 1, 5, and 10 years in KT group was 
98.7%, 90.2%, and 90.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed body mass 
index (BMI) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-0.93, p < 
0.001), and albumin (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37-0.80, p = 0.002) were significant 
predictors of survival. In the 1st year, patient survival was better in PD than 
KT, but after adjustment for BMI and albumin, both short-term and long-term 
survival in elderly KT group was better than that of PD. Hence, elderly ESRD 
patients should not be barred from KT just because of age.

Aging is influenced by many lifestyle choices that are under human control, 
including nutrition and exercise. The most effective known antiaging 
intervention consists of calorie restriction (CR), which increases lifespan in 
yeasts, worms, fruit flies, mice, and nonhuman primates. CR also improves 
healthspan by preventing the development of various aging-related diseases such 
as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Many 
compounds isolated from plants and fungi prolong lifespan and prevent 
age-related diseases in model organisms. These plant and fungal compounds 
modulate the same cellular and physiological pathways as CR, including those 
involving insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, mammalian target of 
rapamycin, and sirtuins. Modulation of these aging-related pathways results in 
the activation of various cellular processes such as autophagy, DNA repair, and 
neutralization of reactive oxygen species. Together, these cellular processes 
are believed to delay aging and prevent chronic diseases by improving bodily 
functions and stress resistance. We review here the mechanisms of action of 
plant and fungal molecules possessing antiaging properties and discuss the 
possibilities and challenges associated with the development of antiaging 
compounds isolated from natural products.

It is largely unknown whether lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or acute 
retention of urine (AROU) is linked to shorter life expectancy in men. We 
conducted a multicenter, retrospective database analysis of patients undergoing 
transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) to study their relationships. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis with 
stratification to age and indication of TURP were performed. We further 
performed an age- and sex-matched survival analysis with the general population 
using data from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (Hong Kong, China). From January 2002 to December 2012, 
3496 patients undergoing TURP were included in our study, with 1764 patients in 
the LUTS group and 1732 patients in the AROU group. Old age, ischemic heart 
disease, cerebrovascular accident, and AROU were risk factors of mortality. 
Patients aged <70 years (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.52, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.11-2.09, P = 0.010) and 70-80 years (adjusted HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 
1.15-1.70, P = 0.001) in the AROU group had worse survival than those in the 
LUTS group, but such difference was not demonstrated in patients aged >80 years. 
Compared to the general population, younger patients in the LUTS group appeared 
to have better survival (<70 years, P = 0.091; 70-80 years, P = 0.011), but 
younger patients in the AROU group had worse survival (<70 years, P = 0.021; 
70-80 years, P = 0.003). For patients aged >80 years, survival was similar with 
the general population in both the LUTS and AROU groups. In conclusion, AROU at 
young age was associated with mortality, while early detection and management of 
LUTS may improve survival.

BACKGROUND: Despite Côte d'Ivoire epidemic being labeled as "generalized," key 
populations (KPs) are important to overall transmission. Using a dynamic model 
of HIV transmission, we previously estimated the impact of several 
treatment-as-prevention strategies that reached-or missed-the UNAIDS 90-90-90 
targets in different populations groups, including KP and clients of female sex 
workers (CFSWs). To inform program planning and resources allocation, we 
assessed the cost-effectiveness of these scenarios.
METHODS: Costing was performed from the provider's perspective. Unit costs were 
obtained from the Ivorian Programme national de lutte contre le Sida (USD 2015) 
and discounted at 3%. Net incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per adult 
HIV infection prevented and per disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) averted 
were estimated over 2015-2030.
RESULTS: The 3 most cost-effective and affordable scenarios were the ones that 
projected current programmatic trends [ICER = $210; 90% uncertainty interval 
(90% UI): $150-$300], attaining the 90-90-90 objectives among KP and CFSW (ICER 
= $220; 90% UI: $80-$510), and among KP only (ICER = $290; 90% UI: $90-$660). 
The least cost-effective scenario was the one that reached the UNAIDS 90-90-90 
target accompanied by a 25% point drop in condom use in KP (ICER = $710; 90% UI: 
$450-$1270). In comparison, the UNAIDS scenario had a net ICER of $570 (90% UI: 
$390-$900) per DALY averted.
CONCLUSIONS: According to commonly used thresholds, accelerating the HIV 
response can be considered very cost-effective for all scenarios. However, when 
balancing epidemiological impact, cost-effectiveness, and affordability, 
scenarios that sustain both high condom use and rates of viral suppression among 
KP and CFSW seem most promising in Côte d'Ivoire.

IMPORTANCE: In the Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study 
(CANTOS) trial, the anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody canakinumab 
significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients 
with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(hs-CRP) levels of 2 mg/L or greater.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding canakinumab to standard 
of care for the secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events over a range 
of potential prices.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A state-transition Markov model was 
constructed to estimate costs and outcomes over a lifetime horizon by projecting 
rates of recurrent MI, coronary revascularization, infection, and lung cancer 
with and without canakinumab treatment. We used a US health care sector 
perspective, and the base case used the current US market price of canakinumab 
of $73 000 per year. A hypothetical cohort of patients after MI aged 61 years 
with an hs-CRP level of 2 mg/L or greater was constructed.
INTERVENTIONS: Canakinumab, 150 mg, administered every 3 months plus standard of 
care compared with standard of care alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: Adding canakinumab to standard of care increased life expectancy from 
11.31 to 11.36 years, QALYs from 9.37 to 9.50, and costs from $242 000 to 
$1 074 000, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6.4 million per 
QALY gained. The price would have to be reduced by more than 98% (to $1150 per 
year or less) to meet the $100 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. These 
results were generally robust across alternative assumptions, eg, substantially 
lower health-related quality of life after recurrent cardiovascular events, 
lower infection rates while receiving canakinumab, and reduced all-cause 
mortality while receiving canakinumab. Including a potential beneficial effect 
of canakinumab on lung cancer incidence improved the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio to $3.5 million per QALY gained. A strategy of 
continuing canakinumab selectively in patients with reduction in hs-CRP levels 
to less than 2 mg/L would have a cost-effectiveness ratio of $819 000 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Canakinumab is not cost-effective at current US 
prices for prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with a 
prior MI. Substantial price reductions would be needed for canakinumab to be 
considered cost-effective.
