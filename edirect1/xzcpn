rare medical conditions. The challenges in conducting economic evaluations of 
medical devices include limited data to support effectiveness, device-operator 
interaction (surgical experience) and incremental innovations (miniaturisation). 
However, whilst high-cost pharmaceuticals may be funded by a single source 
(federal government), the funding of high-cost devices is complex and may be 
funded via a combination of federal, state and private health insurance. Based 
on the Life-Saving Drugs Program criteria, we found that ventricular assist 
devices could be funded by a similar mechanism to that which funds high-cost 
life-extending pharmaceuticals. This article highlights the complexities of 
medical device reimbursement. Whilst differences in available evidence affect 
the evaluation process, differences in funding methods contribute to inequitable 
reimbursement decisions between medical devices and pharmaceuticals.

Parental longevity is associated with an increased life expectancy; results with 
regard to specific diseases are conflicting. There are limited data focusing on 
host characteristics and their effect on survival among multiple myeloma (MM) 
patients and individuals with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance 
(MGUS). Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the impact of parental longevity on 
survival of patients with MM and MGUS. A total of 4675 patients with MM, 6812 
MGUS patients and 13 398 population-based controls for MM as well as 19 110 
controls for MGUS, from 1988 to 2013, were included in the study. Longevity was 
defined as >90 years of age. Among MM patients, parental longevity was 
associated with a decreased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) = 0·92, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0·84-0·99] and the same was true for MGUS patients 
(HR = 0·87, 95% CI 0·78-0·96). Having one long lived parent significantly 
decreased the risk of death in both groups, but was not statistically 
significant when both parents exceeded 90 years of age. In conclusion, parental 
longevity decreases the risk of death for patients with MM and MGUS which may 
reflect the importance of the host's genetic and environmental factors in 
relation to survival.

The EPO-TBI multi-national randomized controlled trial found that erythropoietin 
(EPO), when compared to placebo, did not affect 6-month neurological outcome, 
but reduced illness severity-adjusted mortality in patients with traumatic brain 
injury (TBI), making the cost-effectiveness of EPO in TBI uncertain. The current 
study uses patient-level data from the EPO-TBI trial to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of EPO in patients with moderate or severe TBI from the 
healthcare payers' perspective. We addressed the issue of transferability in 
multi-national trials by estimating costs and effects for specific geographical 
regions of the study (Australia/New Zealand, Europe, and Saudi Arabia). 
Unadjusted mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]) at 6 months were 0.027 (0.020-0.034; p < 0.001) higher in the EPO group, 
with an adjusted QALY increment of 0.014 (0.000-0.028; p = 0.04). Mean 
unadjusted costs (95% CI) were $US5668 (-9191 to -2144; p = 0.002) lower in the 
treatment group; controlling for baseline IMPACT-TBI score and regional 
heterogeneity reduced this difference to $2377 (-12,446 to 7693; p = 0.64). For 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $US50,000 per QALY, 71.8% of replications were 
considered cost-effective. Therefore, we did not find evidence that EPO was 
significantly cost-effective in the treatment of moderate or severe TBI at 
6-month follow-up.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of undiagnosed HIV is declining in Africa, and 
various HIV testing approaches are finding lower positivity rates. In this 
context, the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of community-based 
HIV self-testing (CB-HIVST) is unclear. We aimed to assess this in different 
sub-populations and across scenarios characterized by different adult HIV 
prevalence and antiretroviral treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: The synthesis model was used to address this aim. Three sub-populations 
were considered for CB-HIVST: (i) women having transactional sex (WTS); (ii) 
young people (15 to 24 years); and (iii) adult men (25 to 49 years). We assumed 
uptake of CB-HIVST similar to that reported in epidemiological studies (base 
case), or assumed people use CB-HIVST only if exposed to risk (condomless sex) 
since last HIV test. We also considered a five-year time-limited CB-HIVST 
programme. Cost-effectiveness was defined by an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER; cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted) below US$500 
over a time horizon of 50 years. The efficiency of targeted CB-HIVST was 
evaluated using the number of additional tests per infection or death averted.
RESULTS: In the base case, targeting adult men with CB-HIVST offered the 
greatest impact, averting 1500 HIV infections and 520 deaths per year in the 
context of a simulated country with nine million adults, and impact could be 
enhanced by linkage to voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). However, the 
approach was only cost-effective if the programme was limited to five years or 
the undiagnosed prevalence was above 3%. CB-HIVST to WTS was the most 
cost-effective. The main drivers of cost-effectiveness were the cost of CB-HIVST 
and the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. All other CB-HIVST scenarios had an ICER 
above US$500 per DALY averted.
CONCLUSIONS: CB-HIVST showed an important epidemiological impact. To maximize 
population health within a fixed budget, CB-HIVST needs to be targeted on the 
basis of the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV, sub-population and the overall costs 
of delivering this testing modality. Linkage to VMMC enhances its 
cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Digital education is "the act of teaching and learning by means of 
digital technologies." Digital education comprises a wide range of interventions 
that can be broadly divided into offline digital education, online digital 
education, digital game-based learning, massive open online courses (MOOCs), 
psychomotor skills trainers, virtual reality environments, virtual patient 
simulations, and m-learning. Chronic wounds pose an immense economic and 
psychosocial burden to patients and the health care system, as caring for them 
require highly specialized personnel. Current training strategies face 
significant barriers, such as lack of time due to work commitments, distance 
from provider centers, and costs. Therefore, there is an increased need to 
synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of digital education interventions on 
chronic wounds management in health care professionals.
OBJECTIVE: Our main objective is to assess the effectiveness of digital 
education as a stand-alone approach or as part of a blended-learning approach in 
improving pre- and postregistration health care professionals' knowledge, 
attitudes, practical skills, and behavior in the management of chronic wounds, 
as well as their satisfaction with the intervention. Secondary objectives are to 
evaluate patient-related outcomes, cost-effectiveness of the interventions, and 
any unfavorable or undesirable outcomes that may arise.
METHODS: This systematic review will follow the methodology as described in the 
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. As our systematic 
review is one of a series of reviews on digital education for health 
professionals' education, we will use a previously developed search strategy. 
This search includes the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), 
Web of Science, the Educational Resource Information Centre (ERIC) (Ovid), 
PsycINFO (Ovid), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature 
(CINAHL) (EBSCO), the ProQuest Dissertation and Theses database, and trial 
registries. Databases will be searched for studies published from January 1990 
to August 2018. Two independent reviewers will screen the library for included 
studies. We will describe the screening process using a flowchart as per the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines. We will extract the data using a previously developed, structured 
data extraction form. Included studies will be quality-assessed using the Risk 
of Bias tool from Cochrane. We will narratively summarize the data and, if 
possible, we will conduct a meta-analysis. We will use Cochrane's RevMan 5.3 
software for data analysis.
RESULTS: We have completed the screening of titles and abstracts for this 
systematic review and are currently selecting papers against our inclusion and 
exclusion criteria through full-text revision. We are expecting to complete our 
review by the end of April 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will provide an in-depth analysis of digital 
education strategies to train health care providers in the management of chronic 
wounds. We consider this topic particularly relevant given the current 
challenges facing health care systems worldwide, including shortages of skilled 
personnel and a steep increase in the population of older adults as a result of 
a prolonged life expectancy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The risk of cervical cancer (CC) among women immunosuppressed 
for a variety of reasons is well documented in the literature. Although there is 
improved organ function, quality of life and life expectancy gained through use 
of immunosuppressant therapy, there may be increased long-term risk of cervical 
neoplasia and cancer and the need for more intense screening, surveillance, and 
management. Although guidance for CC screening among HIV-infected women (see 
Table 1) has been supported by evidence from retrospective and prospective 
studies, recommendations for CC screening among non-HIV immunosuppressed women 
remains limited because quality evidence is lacking. Moreover, CC screening 
guidelines for HIV-infected women have changed because better treatments evolved 
and resulted in longer life expectancy.The objective of this report was to 
summarize current knowledge of CC, squamous intraepithelial lesions, and human 
papillomavirus (HPV) infection in non-HIV immunocompromised women to determine 
best practices for CC surveillance in this population and provide 
recommendations for screening. We evaluated those with solid organ transplant, 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and a number of autoimmune diseases.A panel 
of health care professionals involved in CC research and care was assembled to 
review and discuss existing literature on the subject and come to conclusions 
about screening based on available evidence and expert opinion. Literature 
searches were performed using key words such as CC, cervical dysplasia/squamous 
intraepithelial lesion, HPV, and type of immunosuppression resulting in an 
initial group of 346 articles. Additional publications were identified from 
review of citations in these articles. All generated abstracts were reviewed to 
identify relevant articles. Articles published within 10 years were considered 
priority for review. Reviews of the literature were summarized with relevant 
statistical comparisons. Recommendations for screening generated from each group 
were largely based on expert opinion. Adherence to screening, health benefits 
and risks, and available clinical expertise were all considered in formulating 
the recommendations to the degree that information was available.
RESULTS: Solid Organ Transplant: Evidence specific for renal, heart/lung, liver, 
and pancreas transplants show a consistent increase in risk of cervical 
neoplasia and invasive CC, demonstrating the importance of long-term 
surveillance and treatment. Reports demonstrate continued risk long after 
transplantation, emphasizing the need for screening throughout a woman's 
lifetime.Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: Although there is some evidence for 
an increase in CC in large cohort studies of these patients, conflicting results 
may reflect that many patients did not survive long enough to evaluate the 
incidence of slow-growing or delayed-onset cancers. Furthermore, history of 
cervical screening or previous hysterectomy was not included in registry study 
analysis, possibly leading to underestimation of CC incidence rates.Genital or 
chronic graft versus host disease is associated with an increase in high-grade 
cervical neoplasia and posttransplant HPV positivity.Inflammatory Bowel Disease: 
There is no strong evidence to support that inflammatory bowel disease alone 
increases cervical neoplasia or cancer risk. In contrast, immunosuppressant 
therapy does seem to increase the risk, although results of observational 
studies are conflicting regarding which type of immunosuppressant medication 
increases risk. Moreover, misclassification of cases may underestimate CC risk 
in this population. Recently published preventive care guidelines for women with 
inflammatory bowel disease taking immunosuppressive therapy recommend a need for 
continued long-term CC screening.Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid 
Arthritis: The risk of cervical high-grade neoplasia and cancer was higher among 
women with systemic lupus erythematosus than those with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), although studies were limited by size, inclusion of women with low-grade 
neoplasia in main outcomes, and variability of disease severity or exposure to 
immunosuppressants. In studies designed to look specifically at 
immunosuppressant use, however, there did seem to be an increase in risk, 
identified mostly in women with RA. Although the strength of the evidence is 
limited, the increase in risk is consistent across studies.Type 1 DM: There is a 
paucity of evidence-based reports associating type 1 DM with an increased risk 
of cervical neoplasia and cancer.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The panel proposed that CC screening guidelines for non-HIV 
immunocompromised women follow either the (1) guidelines for the general 
population or (2) current center for disease control guidelines for HIV-infected 
women. The following are the summaries for each group reviewed, and more details 
are noted in accompanying table:Solid Organ Transplant: The transplant 
population reflects a greater risk of CC than the general population and 
guidelines for HIV-infected women are a reasonable approach for screening and 
surveillance.Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: These women have a greater risk 
of CC than the general population and guidelines for HIV-infected women are a 
reasonable approach for screening. A new diagnosis of genital or chronic graft 
versus host disease in a woman post-stem cell transplant results in a greater 
risk of CC than in the general population and should result in more intensive 
screening and surveillance.Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Women with inflammatory 
bowel disease being treated with immunosuppressive drugs are at greater risk of 
cervical neoplasia and cancer than the general population and guidelines for 
HIV-infected women are a reasonable approach for screening and surveillance. 
Those women with inflammatory bowel disease not on immunosuppressive therapy are 
not at an increased risk and should follow screening guidelines for the general 
population.Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis: All women with 
systemic lupus erythematosus, whether on immunosuppressant therapy or not and 
those women with RA on immunosuppressant therapy have a greater risk of cervical 
neoplasia and cancer than the general population and should follow CC screening 
guidelines for HIV-infected women. Women with RA not on immunosuppressant 
therapy should follow CC screening guidelines for the general population.Type 1 
Diabetes Mellitus: Because of a lack of evidence of increased risk of cervical 
neoplasia and cancer among women with type 1 DM, these women should follow the 
screening guidelines for the general population.

Mental and Physical Quality of Life by Age Groups in People Living With HIV.

Jang HJ, Satre DD, Leyden W, Leibowitz A, Silverberg MJ.

Quality of life (QoL) is relevant to people living with HIV (PLWH) with 
increased life expectancy because of antiretroviral therapy. Our cross-sectional 
study examined associations between sociodemographic, HIV-related and 
psychological variables, and QoL, overall and by age. PLWH (n = 614) completed 
questionnaires at enrollment in an alcohol treatment study. QoL was assessed by 
the 12-item Short Form Survey, which includes physical and mental domains. 
Linear regression models evaluated the association of age and other factors with 
mental and physical QoL. PLWH younger than 50 years (n = 310) reported poorer 
mental QoL but better physical QoL compared to older PLWH (n = 304). Poorer 
mental QoL was associated with substance use, depression, and anxiety. Poorer 
physical QoL was associated with depression and history of injection drug use. 
We identified age-group differences in QoL for this primary care-based sample. 
Health care providers can use our findings to guide patient-centered care.

Chronic pleural infection is characterized by thickened pleura and nonexpandable 
lung often requiring definitive surgical intervention, such as decortication 
and/or pleural obliteration procedures. Such procedures are associated with 
significant morbidity and require proper patient selection for a successful 
outcome. We report a cohort of 11 patients with pleural space infection and a 
nonexpandable lung treated with tunneled pleural catheters (TPCs). Following 
placement, hospital discharge and TPC removal occurred after a median of 5 and 
36 days, respectively. Three patients presented with residual loculated effusion 
that resolved with instillation of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. One 
patient eventually required open window thoracostomy for ongoing pleural 
infection due to poor medical compliance with TPC care and drainage 
instructions. TPCs represent an alternative option for drainage of an infected 
pleural space in nonsurgical candidates with a nonexpandable lung. Their use, as 
a compliment to traditional treatment, may facilitate prompt hospital discharge 
and ambulatory management in patients with limited life expectancy.

Improved life expectancy worldwide has resulted in a significant increase in 
age-related diseases. Dementia is one of the fastest growing age-related 
diseases, with 75 million adults globally projected to develop the condition by 
2030. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and 
represents the most significant stage of cognitive decline. With no cure 
identified to date for AD, focus is being placed on preventative strategies to 
slow progression, minimize the burden of neurological disease, and promote 
healthy aging. Accumulating evidence suggests that nutrition (e.g., via fruit, 
vegetables, fish) is important for optimizing cognition and reducing risk of AD. 
This review examines the role of nutrition on cognition and AD, with specific 
emphasis on the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) and key nutritional components of the 
MeDi, namely xanthophyll carotenoids and omega-3 fatty acids. Given their 
selective presence in the brain and their ability to attenuate proposed 
mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis (namely oxidative damage and 
inflammation), these nutritional compounds offer potential for optimizing 
cognition and reducing the risk of AD.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effect of different loading pistons, made of 
various materials and with different elastic moduli acting as antagonist 
material, on stress distribution and fatigue behavior of a CAD/CAM silica-based 
ceramic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Discs of CAD/CAM made silica-based ceramic (N = 60) (VITA 
MARK II) were divided into six groups (n = 10 per group), according to the test 
method (M: Monotonic; F: Fatigue) and the antagonist piston material (T: 
Tungsten; S: Steel; G: Epoxy resin). FT, FS and FG combinations were submitted 
to mechanical cycling (2 × 106 cycles, 4 Hz, 45 N). The bending stress after 
fatigue were also valuated using Weibull analysis and the parameters η (eta), β 
(beta) and the mean time to failure (MTTF) were calculated. Fractographic 
analysis and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) were performed. Data were analyzed 
using ANOVA and Tukey's tests (alpha=0.05).
RESULTS: MG presented significantly less bending strength (MPa) (75.6) compared 
to MT (87.8) and MS (84.4) (p < 0.05). Six specimens from FT (MMTF: 8.3 × 106; 
β:0.60; η:5.6 × 106), four from FS (MMTF: 1.9 × 106; β:1.2; η:2.0 × 106) and one 
from FG (MMTF: 1.3 × 106; β:0.48; η:0.64 × 106) survived the fatigue test. The 
stress peak on the tensile surface of S was similar to that of T and both were 
less than that of G. The failure origins were on the tensile surface.
CONCLUSION: The epoxy resin pistons were able to decrease the bending stress, 
and life expectancy (faster failure) of a silica-based ceramic compared to 
tungsten and steel.

OBJECTIVE: This article explores the life and career of Sebastian K. Littmann. 
He was a foundational figure of the University of Calgary's Department of 
Psychiatry in his role as its second chair and, before this, as an influential 
administrator at Toronto's Queen Street Mental Health Centre and Clarke 
Institute during a transitional period in the 1970s-1980s. According to McGill 
University's Heinz Lehmann, this transitional period was when the field of 
psychiatry underwent an identity crisis that threatened to dissolve the 
discipline and see its functions increasingly filled by counsellors, 
neurologists, and primary physicians. Littmann's professional background and 
training in Edinburgh was followed by periods of community work in New York, 
which-by the time he immigrated to Canada-predisposed him to favour a humane and 
community-based approach to psychiatric work; this approach encompassed the 
cultural variations that were increasingly characterizing North America's urban 
social landscape. His compassionate and progressive approach to treatment was 
remarkable in light of his troubled and deprived upbringing in Nazi-era Germany.
CONCLUSIONS: The present sketch of Littmann's personal and professional 
biography serves to highlight the ways that major historical events and 
large-scale migration movements, which affected Central Europe, impacted the 
development of Canadian psychiatry and, by extension, individual Canadians in 
the twentieth century.

OBJECTIF : Le présent article veut explorer la vie et la carrière de Sebastian 
K. Littmann. Il a été un personnage fondamental du département de psychiatrie de 
l’Université de Calgary à titre de deuxième chef du département, et précédemment 
il a été administrateur influent au Centre de santé mentale de Queen Street à 
Toronto et à l’Institut Clarke, durant la période transitionnelle des années 
1970 et 1980, durant laquelle, selon Heinz Lehmann de l’Université McGill, le 
domaine de la psychiatrie a traversé une crise d’identité qui menaçait de 
dissoudre la discipline et de voir ses fonctions envahies de plus en plus par 
des conseillers, des neurologues et des médecins des soins primaires. Les 
antécédents professionnels et la formation de Littmann à Édimbourg, suivis de 
périodes de travail communautaire à New York, le prédisposaient lui-même à 
favoriser une approche humaine et communautaire du travail psychiatrique au 
moment où il a immigré au Canada – approche qui tenait compte de la variété 
culturelle qui caractérisait peu à peu le paysage social urbain d’Amérique du 
Nord. Son approche compatissante et progressive du traitement était remarquable 
à la lumière de son éducation perturbée et défavorisée en Allemagne nazie.
CONCLUSIONS : Cette esquisse de la biographie personnelle et professionnelle 
sert à présenter les façons dont les grands événements historiques et les vastes 
mouvements de migration qui ont touché l’Europe centrale ont laissé leur 
empreinte sur le développement de la psychiatrie canadienne et sur les citoyens 
canadiens du 20e siècle.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a haematological malignancy characterized by 
significant morbidity and mortality. This study sought to develop an in-depth 
understanding of patients' lived experiences of relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma (RRMM) and its treatment, and to identify which features of treatment 
were most important to them.
METHODS: Qualitative interviews and focus groups (FGs) were conducted with 32 
people living with RRMM across Canada. In Phase 1, interviews focused on 
participants' accounts of their experiences with the disease and its treatment 
and laid the groundwork for the FGs (Phase 2). The FGs developed a deeper 
understanding of patients' treatment priorities. Interview and FG transcripts 
were coded for emergent themes and patterns.
RESULTS: The interviews identified important side effects that had significant 
impacts on patients' lives, including physical, cognitive, and 
psychological/emotional side effects. Participants also identified specific 
treatment features (attributes) that were important to them. These were compiled 
into a list and used in the FGs to understand patients' priorities. Higher 
prioritized attributes were: life expectancy, physical and cognitive side 
effects, and financial impact. Mode of administration, treatment intervals, 
psychological side effects, and sleep/mood effects were identified as lower 
priorities.
CONCLUSIONS: RRMM and its treatments impact importantly on patients' 
quality-of-life across a range of domains. Patients prioritized treatment 
features that could enhance life expectancy, minimize side effects and offset 
financial burdens.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: A clear articulation of patient priorities 
can contribute to efforts to design treatment with patients' concerns in mind, 
thereby promoting a more patient-centered approach to care.

Paediatric palliative care has only been clearly referred to as such in France 
since 2008. It is defined as care provided from the antenatal period until the 
age of 19 to children suffering from a disease which limits or threatens their 
life expectancy. Many nurses will encounter patients such as these at some point 
during their career in a health or medical-social facility. They require 
multi-disciplinary care and coordination between all the health professionals 
involved in the treatment.

Human longevity involves genetic, nutritional, environmental and many other 
factors playing a key role in healthy aging. Previous studies have shown that 
mineral metabolism and homeostasis are associated with lifespan extension. 
However, the majority of them have focused on a limited number of elements and 
ignored the complex relationship between them. In this study, we carried out a 
network-based approach to investigate the urinary ionome of nonagenarians and 
centenarians (longevity group) when compared with their biologically unrelated 
and younger family members (control group) from a Han Chinese population. 
Several differentially changed elements were identified, almost all of which 
showed an elevated level in the longevity group. Correlation analysis of the 
ionome revealed significant element-element interactions in each group. We then 
divided each group into distinct subgroups according to age ranges, and built 
the elemental correlation network for each of them. Significant elemental 
correlations and correlation changes involving all examined elements were 
identified within or between different subgroups, implying a highly dynamic and 
complex crosstalk among the elements during human life. Finally, more similar 
elemental patterns were observed between extremely old and middle-aged people. 
Overall, our data reveal new relationship between urinary minerals and human 
longevity, which may extend our understanding of the mechanism of healthy aging.

BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, is 
approved for locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma. SAUL evaluated 
atezolizumab in a broader, pretreated population, including patients ineligible 
for the pivotal IMvigor211 phase 3 trial of atezolizumab.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in an 
international real-world setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between November 2016 and March 2018 (median 
follow-up 12.7mo), 1004 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
or nonurothelial urinary tract carcinoma who experienced progression during or 
after one to three prior therapies for inoperable, locally advanced, or 
metastatic disease were enrolled. Patients with renal impairment, treated 
central nervous system metastases, or stable controlled autoimmune disease were 
eligible; 10% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG 
PS) 2 and 98% were platinum pretreated (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02928406).
INTERVENTION: Atezolizumab 1200mg every 3wk until progression or unacceptable 
toxicity.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was safety. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free 
survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median treatment duration was 2.8mo (range 0-19); 
22% remained on treatment and 8% discontinued because of toxicity. Grade ≥3 
adverse events occurred in 45% of patients. The most common grade ≥3 
treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, asthenia, colitis, and 
hypertension (each in 1%). Median OS was 8.7mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 
7.8-9.9). The 6-mo OS rate was 60% (95% CI 57-63%), median PFS was 2.2mo (95% CI 
2.1-2.4), and the ORR was 13% (95% CI 11-16%; 3% complete responses). Among 
IMvigor211-like patients (excluding ECOG PS 2 and other IMvigor211 exclusion 
criteria), median OS was 10.0mo (95% CI 8.8-11.9) and 6-mo OS was 65% (95% CI 
61-69%).
CONCLUSIONS: SAUL confirms the tolerability of atezolizumab in a real-world 
pretreated population with urinary tract carcinoma. Efficacy overall and in the 
IMvigor211-like subgroup is consistent with previous pivotal anti-PD-L1/PD-1 
urothelial carcinoma trials. These results support the use of atezolizumab in 
urinary tract carcinoma, including patients with limited treatment options.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this international study we investigated the efficacy and 
safety of atezolizumab treatment for advanced urinary tract cancer in a large 
population of pretreated patients, including those who would not normally be 
candidates for clinical trials. Patients tolerated the treatment well, even if 
they had autoimmune disease, were being treated with corticosteroids, or had 
disease that had spread to their brain. Life expectancy in this study for 
patients typical of everyday clinical practice was similar to that seen in 
trials that enrolled only selected fitter patients.

Human beings are facing emerging degenerative and cancer diseases, in large 
part, as a consequence of increased life expectancy. In the near future, 
researchers will have to put even more effort into fighting these new 
challenges, one of which will be prevention of cancer while continuing to 
improve the aging process through this increased life expectancy. In the last 
few decades, relevance of the Hippo pathway on cancer has become an important 
study since it is a major regulator of organ size control and proliferation. 
However, its deregulation can induce tumors throughout the body by regulating 
cell proliferation, disrupting cell polarity, releasing YAP and TAZ from the 
Scribble complexes and facilitating survival gene expression via activation of 
TEAD transcription factors. This pathway is also involved in some of the most 
important mechanisms that control the aging processes, such as the AMP-activated 
protein kinase and sirtuin pathways, along with autophagy and oxidative stress 
response/antioxidant defense. This could be the link between two tightly 
connected processes that could open a broader range of targeted molecular 
therapies to fight aging and cancer. Therefore, available knowledge of the 
processes involved in the Hippo pathway during aging and cancer must necessarily 
be well understood.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate experiences and preferences for 
disclosure of life expectancy, agreement between them, and the factors 
associated with preferences for disclosure of life expectancy with physicians 
among cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.
METHODS: Cancer patients aged 20 years or older were consecutively sampled when 
they started radiation therapy at two university hospitals. Patients completed 
self-administered questionnaires concerning their experiences of and preferences 
for disclosure of life expectancy, treatment decision-making, psychological 
distress, physical symptoms, sociodemographic and medical factors, physician's 
communication style, and provision of psychological, physical, and practical 
support.
RESULTS: Among the 226 respondents (response rate: 58%) who responded, 54% 
experienced disclosure of life expectancy, and 45% preferred it. The agreement 
is 65%. Eighty-five percent recognized their aim of radiation therapy as 
curative. A univariate analysis indicated that having a full/part-time job and 
wishing to leave treatment decisions to doctors were significantly associated 
with preference for disclosure of life expectancy, but psychological distress 
was not. A multiple regression analysis revealed that having a 
full-time/part-time job was significantly associated with preference of 
communication about life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-four percent of the patients experienced and 45% of the 
patients preferred disclosure of life expectancy. The agreement is moderate. Our 
results show that there was a significant association between employment status 
and patient's preference for disclosure of life expectancy with physicians. 
Communication of prognosis is difficult but whether a patient continues to work 
or not may be an indicator of preference.
