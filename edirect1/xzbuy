2013. Vast improvements in the life expectancy of these patients were seen over 
the study period; larger improvements were seen in the youngest ages. The great 
improvements in life expectancy translated into great reductions in the loss in 
expectation of life. Patients of all ages diagnosed in 2013 will, on average, 
lose < 3 life-years as a result of CML.
CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate and new TKIs along with allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation and other factors have contributed to the life expectancy in 
patients with CML approaching that of the general population today. This will be 
an important message to convey to patients to understand the impact of a CML 
diagnosis on their life. In addition, the increasing prevalence of patients with 
CML will have a great effect on future health care costs as long as continuous 
TKI treatment is required.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of adherence and its significance in the 
relationship between self-efficacy and self-management of diabetic patients 
undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in Taiwan.
DESIGN: Descriptive and correlational survey design.
SETTING: Three outpatient clinics in Taiwan.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with diabetes undergoing CABG at least 6 months 
before the study, 18 years of age or older, able to communicate verbally without 
any psychiatric problems, and with a life expectancy longer than 1 year.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-management assessment (self-efficacy for managing 
disease and adherence to guidelines and medication measured on a scale of 0-8), 
the higher aspects of self-management (keeping appointments, taking medication 
properly and keeping follow-up appointments) and the lower aspects of 
self-management (inability to share decisions with primary physician, inability 
to take correct actions when symptoms worsen and inability to adapt habits to 
improve health).
RESULTS: The mean score obtained for self-management among the 166 participants 
was 6.48, with 57 (34.3%) of them showing non-adherent behaviour. Self-efficacy 
accounts for 38% (R(2)=0.380, F(1,103)=63.124, p < 0.001), and 54% of good 
self-management was explained by self-efficacy and adherence in managing disease 
(R(2)=0.540, F(2,102)=56.937, p<0.001). Adherence accounts for 16% of better 
self-management, age and education combined account for 4.9% (R(2)=0.589, 
F(6.98)=23.399, p<0.001), and lifestyle items account for 5.2% (R(2)=0.641, 
F(14,90)=11.457, p<0.001). Disease-related variables contribute 3.4% 
(R(2)=0.674, F(17,87)=10.599, p<0.001). Thus self-efficacy, adherence, age, 
education, primary care provider and systolic pressure are considered 
significant predictors of self-management. With the exception of adherence, none 
of the variables had a statistically significant mediating effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm strong relationships between self-efficacy, 
adherence and self-management, with adherence having a significant mediating 
effect in post-CABG patients with diabetes in Taiwan.

Mechanical prostheses and stented xenografts (bioprosthesis) are most commonly 
used substitutes for aortic and mitral valve replacement. The mechanical valves 
have the advantage of durability but are accompanied with the risk of 
thromboembolism, problems of long-term anticoagulation, and associated risk of 
bleeding. In contrast, bioprosthetic valves do not require long-term 
anticoagulation, but carry the risk of structural valve degeneration and 
re-operation. A mechanical valve is favoured in young patients (<40 years) if 
reliable anticoagulation is ensured. In elderly patients (>60 years), a 
bioprosthesis is a suitable substitute. In middle-aged patients (40-60 years), 
risk of re-operation in a bioprosthesis is equal to that of bleeding in a 
mechanical valve. Traditionally, a bioprosthesis is opted in patients with 
limited life expectancy. Calculation of life expectancy, based solely upon 
chronological age, is erroneous. In developing countries, the calculated life 
expectancy is much lower than that of Western population, hence age related 
Western cut-offs are not valid in developing countries. Besides age, cardiac 
condition of the patient, systemic illnesses, socio-economic status, gender and 
geographical location also decide the life expectancy of the patients. Selection 
of the prosthetic valve substitute should be based on: aspiration of the 
patient, life expectancy, socio-economic and educational background, occupation 
of the patient, availability, cost, monitoring of anti-coagulation, monitoring 
of valve function and other valve related complications, and possibility of 
re-operation.

As the population ages and life expectancy increases in the human population, 
more individuals will be diagnosed with bladder cancer (BC). The definition of 
who is elderly is likely to change in the future from the commonly used cut-off 
of ≥75 years of age. Physiological rather than chronological age is key. BC care 
in the elderly is likely to become a very common problem in daily practice. 
Concerns have been raised that senior BC patients are not given treatments that 
could cure their disease. Clinicians lack quantitative and reliable estimates of 
competing mortality risks when considering treatments for BC. Majority of 
patients diagnosed with BC are elderly, making treatment decisions complex with 
their increasing number of comorbidities. A multidisciplinary approach to these 
patients may be a way to incorporate discussion from various disciplines 
regarding treatment options available. Here we review various treatment options 
for elderly patients with muscle invasive BC and nonmuscle invasive BC. We 
include differences in treatments from robotic versus open radical cystectomy, 
various urinary diversion techniques, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and 
combination treatments. In clinical practice, treatment decisions for elderly 
patients should be done on a case-by-case basis, tailored to each patient with 
their specific histories and comorbidities considered. Some healthy elderly 
patients may be better candidates for extensive curative treatments than their 
younger counterparts. This implies that these important, life-altering decisions 
cannot be solely based on age as many other factors can affect patient survival 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The medico-economic impact of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is poorly documented.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pulmonary 
rehabilitation in a hypothetical cohort of COPD patients.
METHODS: We used a multi-state Markov model, adopting society's perspective. 
Simulated cohorts of French GOLD stage 2 to 4 COPD patients with and without 
pulmonary rehabilitation were compared in terms of life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), disease-related costs, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses included variations of key 
model parameters.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: At the horizon of a COPD patient's remaining lifetime, 
pulmonary rehabilitation would result in mean gain of 0.8 QALY, with an over 
disease-related costs of 14 102 € per patient. The ICER was 17 583 €/QALY. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that pulmonary rehabilitation was cost-effective in 
every scenario (ICER <50 000 €/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: These results should provide a useful basis for COPD pulmonary 
rehabilitation programs.

Smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use effects on survival in HIV-positive 
persons.

Petoumenos K(1), Law MG.

Author information:
(1)The Kirby Institute, UNSW Australia, Sydney, Australia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-positive 
patients experience an increase in non-AIDS associated comorbidities. Causes of 
death are now more frequently associated with ageing and smoking; alcohol and 
drug use are strongly linked to many of these causes.
RECENT FINDINGS: An almost equal life expectancy among HIV-positive people 
compared with HIV-negative population has been recently reported. However, life 
expectancy is reduced among HIV-positive smokers by at least 16 years and 
further reduced for people who have a history of excessive alcohol and drug use. 
Cohort studies report between a 1.5- and two-fold or greater increased mortality 
risk as a result of smoking. In a Danish population study, 61% of deaths in 
HIV-positive people were associated with smoking. Excessive alcohol and drug use 
are also elevated among specific HIV subpopulations and significantly impact 
morbidity and mortality. In the Veteran Affairs cohort study, moderate and 
excessive alcohol use increased mortality by 25-35% compared with low alcohol 
use.
SUMMARY: Despite the effective therapy, smoking, alcohol and drug use have a 
significant role in increased mortality and reduced life expectancy among 
HIV-positive people. These factors need to be in continued focus for the 
management and care of HIV-positive people.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, whose prevalence 
is growing along with the increased life expectancy. Although the accumulation 
and deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain is viewed as one of 
the pathological hallmarks of AD and underlies, at least in part, brain cell 
dysfunction and behavior alterations, the etiology of this neurodegenerative 
disease is still poorly understood. Noticeably, increased amyloid load is 
accompanied by marked inflammatory alterations, both at the level of the brain 
parenchyma and at the barriers of the brain. However, it is debatable whether 
the neuroinflammation observed in aging and in AD, together with alterations in 
the peripheral immune system, are responsible for increased amyloidogenesis, 
decreased clearance of Aβ out of the brain and/or the marked deficits in memory 
and cognition manifested by AD patients. Herein, we scrutinize some important 
traits of the pathophysiology of aging and AD, focusing on the interplay between 
the amyloidogenic pathway, neuroinflammation and the peripheral immune system.

Vitiligo is a common inflammatory skin disease with a worldwide prevalence of 
0.5% to 2.0% of the population. In the pediatric population, the exact 
prevalence of vitiligo is unknown, although many studies state that most cases 
of vitiligo are acquired early in life. The disease is disfiguring, with a major 
psychological impact on children and their parents. Half of vitiligo cases have 
a childhood onset, needing thus a treatment approach that will minimize 
treatment side effects while avoiding psychological impacts. Management of 
vitiligo should take into account several factors, including extension, 
psychological impact, and possible associations with other autoimmune diseases. 
This review discusses the epidemiology of vitiligo and outlines the various 
clinical presentations associated with the disorder and their differential 
diagnosis. In addition, the pathophysiology and genetic determinants, the 
psychological impact of vitiligo, and management strategies are reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is common in deprived communities and reduces quality 
of life. Our aim was to evaluate a whole-system primary care-based complex 
intervention, called CARE Plus, to improve quality of life in multimorbid 
patients living in areas of very high deprivation.
METHODS: We used a phase 2 exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial with 
eight general practices in Glasgow in very deprived areas that involved 
multimorbid patients aged 30-65 years. The intervention comprised structured 
longer consultations, relationship continuity, practitioner support, and 
self-management support. Control practices continued treatment as usual. Primary 
outcomes were quality of life (EQ-5D-5L utility scores) and well-being (W-BQ12; 
3 domains). Cost-effectiveness from a health service perspective, engagement, 
and retention were assessed. Recruitment and baseline measurements occurred 
prior to randomisation. Blinding post-randomisation was not possible but outcome 
measurement and analysis were masked. Analyses were by intention to treat.
RESULTS: Of 76 eligible practices contacted, 12 accepted, and eight were 
selected, randomised and participated for the duration of the trial. Of 225 
eligible patients, 152 (68 %) participated and 67/76 (88 %) in each arm 
completed the 12-month assessment. Two patients died in the control group. CARE 
Plus significantly improved one domain of well-being (negative well-being), with 
an effect size of 0.33 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.55) at 12 months 
(p = 0.0036). Positive well-being, energy, and general well-being (the combined 
score of the three components) were not significantly influenced by the 
intervention at 12 months. EQ-5D-5L area under the curve over the 12 months was 
higher in the CARE Plus group (p = 0.002). The incremental cost in the CARE Plus 
group was £929 (95 % CI: £86-£1788) per participant with a gain in 
quality-adjusted life years of 0.076 (95 % CI: 0.028-0.124) over the 12 months 
of the trial, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of £12,224 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained. Modelling suggested that cost-effectiveness 
would continue.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to conduct a high-quality cluster randomised control 
trial of a complex intervention with multimorbid patients in primary care in 
areas of very high deprivation. Enhancing primary care through a whole-system 
approach may be a cost-effective way to protect quality of life for multimorbid 
patients in deprived areas.

The image-guided thermal ablation procedures can be used to treat a variety of 
benign and malignant spinal tumours. Small size osteoid osteoma can be treated 
with laser or radiofrequency. Larger tumours (osteoblastoma, aneurysmal bone 
cyst and metastasis) can be addressed with radiofrequency or cryoablation. 
Results on the literature of spinal microwave ablation are scarce, and thus it 
should be used with caution. A distinct advantage of cryoablation is the ability 
to monitor the ice-ball by intermittent CT or MRI. The different thermal 
insulation, temperature and electrophysiological monitoring techniques should be 
applied. Cautious pre-procedural planning and intermittent intra-procedural 
monitoring of the ablation zone can help reduce neural complications. Tumour 
histology, patient clinical-functional status and life-expectancy should define 
the most efficient and least disabling treatment option.

OBJECTIVE: This paper explores the use of pharmacoeconomic methods of valuation 
to health impacts resulting from exposure to poor air quality. In using such 
methods, interventions that reduce exposure to poor air quality can be directly 
compared, in terms of value for money (or cost-effectiveness), with competing 
demands for finite resources, including other public health interventions.
DESIGN: Using results estimated as part of a health impact assessment regarding 
a West Yorkshire Low Emission Zone strategy, this paper quantifies cost-saving 
and health-improving implications of transport policy through its impact on air 
quality.
DATA SOURCE: Estimates of health-related quality of life and the National Health 
Service (NHS)/Personal Social Services (PSS) costs for identified health events 
were based on data from Leeds and Bradford using peer-reviewed publications or 
Office for National Statistics releases.
POPULATION: Inhabitants of the area within the outer ring roads of Leeds and 
Bradford.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: NHS and PSS costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: Averting an all-cause mortality death generates 8.4 QALYs. Each 
coronary event avoided saves £28 000 in NHS/PSS costs and generates 1.1 QALYs. 
For every fewer case of childhood asthma, there will be NHS/PSS cost saving of 
£3000 and a health benefit of 0.9 QALYs. A single term, low birthweight birth 
avoided saves £2000 in NHS/PSS costs. Preventing a preterm birth saves £24 000 
in NHS/PSS costs and generates 1.3 QALYs. A scenario modelled in the West 
Yorkshire Low Emission Zone Feasibility Study, where pre-EURO 4 buses and HGVs 
are upgraded to EURO 6 by 2016 generates an annual benefit of £2.08 million and 
a one-off benefit of £3.3 million compared with a net present value cost of 
implementation of £6.3 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to improve air quality and health should be evaluated 
and where improvement of population health is the primary objective, 
cost-effectiveness analysis using a NHS/PSS costs and QALYs framework is an 
appropriate methodology.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy of infliximab and ciclosporin in treating severe 
ulcerative colitis (UC) is proven, but there has been no comparative evaluation 
of effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
infliximab and ciclosporin in treating steroid-resistant acute severe UC.
METHOD: Between May 2010 and February 2013 we recruited 270 participants from 52 
hospitals in England, Scotland and Wales to an open-label parallel-group, 
pragmatic randomised trial. Consented patients admitted with severe colitis 
completed baseline quality-of-life questionnaires before receiving intravenous 
hydrocortisone. If they failed to respond within about 5 days, and met other 
inclusion criteria, we invited them to participate and used a web-based adaptive 
randomisation algorithm to allocate them in equal proportions between 5 mg/kg of 
intravenous infliximab at 0, 2 and 6 weeks or 2 mg/kg/day of intravenous 
ciclosporin for 7 days followed by 5.5 mg/kg/day of oral ciclosporin until 12 
weeks from randomisation. Further treatment was at the discretion of physicians 
responsible for clinical management. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted 
survival (QAS): the area under the curve (AUC) of scores derived from Crohn's 
and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaires completed by participants at 3 and 6 
months, and then 6-monthly over 1-3 years, more frequently after surgery. 
Secondary outcomes collected simultaneously included European Quality of Life-5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores and NHS resource use to estimate cost-effectiveness. 
Blinding was possible only for data analysts. We interviewed 20 trial 
participants and 23 participating professionals. Funded data collection finished 
in March 2014. Most participants consented to complete annual questionnaires and 
for us to analyse their routinely collected health data over 10 years.
RESULTS: The 135 participants in each group were well matched at baseline. In 
121 participants analysed in each group, we found no significant difference 
between infliximab and ciclosporin in QAS [mean difference in AUC/day 0.0297 
favouring ciclosporin, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.0088 to 0.0682; 
p = 0.129]; EQ-5D scores (quality-adjusted life-year mean difference 0.021 
favouring ciclosporin, 95% CI -0.032 to 0.096; p = 0.350); Short Form 
questionnaire-6 Dimensions scores (mean difference 0.0051 favouring ciclosporin, 
95% CI -0.0250 to 0.0353; p = 0.737). There was no statistically significant 
difference in colectomy rates [odds ratio (OR) 1.350 favouring infliximab, 95% 
CI 0.832 to 2.188; p = 0.223]; numbers of serious adverse reactions (event 
ratio = 0.938 favouring ciclosporin, 95% CI 0.590 to 1.493; p = 0.788); 
participants with serious adverse reactions (OR 0.660 favouring ciclosporin, 95% 
CI 0.282 to 1.546; p = 0.338); numbers of serious adverse events (event ratio 
1.075 favouring infliximab, 95% CI 0.603 to 1.917; p = 0.807); participants with 
serious adverse events (OR 0.999 favouring infliximab, 95% CI 0.473 to 2.114; 
p = 0.998); deaths (all three who died received infliximab; p = 0.247) or 
concomitant use of immunosuppressants. The lower cost of ciclosporin led to 
lower total NHS costs (mean difference -£5632, 95% CI -£8305 to -£2773; 
p < 0.001). Interviews highlighted the debilitating effect of UC; participants 
were more positive about infliximab than ciclosporin. Professionals reported 
advantages and disadvantages with both drugs, but nurses disliked the 
intravenous ciclosporin.
CONCLUSIONS: Total cost to the NHS was considerably higher for infliximab than 
ciclosporin. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between the two 
drugs in clinical effectiveness, colectomy rates, incidence of SAEs or 
reactions, or mortality, when measured 1-3 years post treatment. To assess 
long-term outcome participants will be followed up for 10 years post 
randomisation, using questionnaires and routinely collected data. Further 
studies will be needed to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of new 
anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs and formulations of ciclosporin.

OBJECTIVES: We examined a series of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 
patients who underwent radical surgery to explore relationships among 
comorbidity, postoperative morbidity and survival.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out of all MPM patients operated 
on in a single centre from 2000 to 2015. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) 
was used to classify patients according to their underlying condition. 
Postoperative complications were scored according to WHO-derived criteria. 
Survival comparisons were performed by Cox analysis.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), 47 
underwent pleurectomy decortication (PD) and 25 underwent palliative 
pleurectomy. The mean CCI of PD patients was significantly higher compared with 
that of EPP patients (P= 0.044). The frequency of grade 3+ complications was 
similar between EPP and PD (27 vs 26%). However, EPP patients had a 6-fold 
higher frequency of pleural sepsis (24 vs 4%, P= 0.002) occurring up to 695 days 
postoperatively. Median overall survival was 19 months (95% CI 13-25) after EPP, 
30 months (95% CI 20-35) after PD and 13 months (95% CI 5-32) after palliative 
pleurectomy. At multivariate analysis, CCI (P< 0.001), histology (P= 0.014) and 
pleural sepsis (P= 0.001), but not complete resection, were significantly 
associated with survival. There was a trend in favour of PD over palliative 
resection after adjusting for histology and CCI.
CONCLUSIONS: The CCI is an independent predictor of survival in MPM patients 
undergoing radical surgery. Owing to its significant frequency and adverse 
impact, pleural sepsis may contribute to a reduced life expectancy after EPP. 
Surgical treatment of MPM remains debatable.

Measuring Central and Eastern Europe's Socio-Economic Development Using Time 
Lags.

Stevinweg 1, 2628 CN Delft, The Netherlands.

This paper applies the 'time lag' method to a set of social and economic 
indicators, examining the development of Central and Eastern Europe since the 
first world war. Originally used to assess technology diffusion, this method 
allows comparison of levels of development between states and through a long 
period of time. It presents how many years have elapsed between achieving a 
certain level of development between countries. The results show that the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe have only narrowly converged with a set 
of 23 highly-developed 'benchmark' states. Development in monetary terms (gross 
domestic product per capita) is the indicator where this region lags most. 
Employment structure, life expectancy or infant mortality show much smaller 
lags. Communist states were closest to the West in the 1960s-early 1970s and 
struggled thereafter. They are still mostly lagging more today than at their 
peak before transformation despite the progress achieved in absolute terms after 
the fall of centrally-planned economy.

OBJECTIVES: With the development of effective treatments and the resulting 
increase in life expectancy, bone mineral density (BMD) alteration has emerged 
as an important comorbidity in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 
(HIV-1)-infected individuals. The potential contributors to the pathogenesis of 
osteopenia/osteoporosis include a higher prevalence of risk factors, combined 
antiretroviral therapy (cART)-exposure, HIV-1 itself and chronic immune 
activation/inflammation. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the "gold 
standard" technique for assessing bone status in HIV-1 population.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate bone mineral status 
in a group of 158 HIV-1-infected subjects. The primary endpoint was the 
feasibility of calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) as a screening tool for 
BMD. All subjects were receiving stable cART and were virologically suppressed 
(HIV-RNA <37 copies/mL) from at least 12 months. Calcaneal QUS parameters were 
analyzed to obtain information on bone mass and microarchitecture. The results 
were compared with those obtained by DXA.
RESULTS: No correlations were found between DXA/QUS parameters and demographic 
or HIV-1-specific characteristics, also including cART strategies. In the 
univariate analyses BMD, QUS indexes, and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool scores 
conversely showed significant associations with one or more demographic or 
HIV-1-related variables. Moreover, a significant relationship between calcaneal 
quantitative ultrasound index/stiffness and femoral/lumbar BMD values from DXA 
was described. The multivariate analysis showed an independent association 
between calcaneal quantitative ultrasound index/stiffness and body mass index, 
higher CD4+ T-cell numbers and low 25-OH D2/D3 vitamin D levels <10 ng/mL 
(P-values: 0.004, 0.016, and 0.015, respectively).
CONCLUSION: As an alternative and/or integrative examination to DXA, calcaneal 
QUS could be proposed as a useful screening in HIV-1-infected patients for 
assessing bone health impairment. In fact, the results obtained confirm that 
calcaneal QUS may be useful for monitoring bone status, being a noninvasive and 
inexpensive technique, especially in those subjects with the classical 
traditional risk factors for bone damage that were observed earlier in HIV-1 
population.

Boston, Massachusetts. She is also an attending gastroenterologist at the Cystic 
Fibrosis Center in Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

Cystic fibrosis has historically been considered a pulmonary disease, but with 
the increasing life expectancy of these patients, gastrointestinal 
manifestations are becoming more important. Furthermore, nutritional status is 
closely linked to pulmonary function and, thus, overall mortality. This article 
discusses gastrointestinal manifestations (which involve nutritional, 
pancreatic, hepatobiliary, and, in particular, gastrointestinal tract issues) of 
cystic fibrosis as well as management of the disease. In addition, the article 
discusses studies that have been critical to our understanding of 
gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis.

The prevalence and incidence of stroke rises with life expectancy. However, 
except for the use of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, the 
translation of new therapies for acute stroke from animal models into humans has 
been relatively unsuccessful. Oxidative DNA and protein damage following stroke 
is typically associated with cell death. Cause-effect relationships between 
reactive oxygen species and epigenetic modifications have been established in 
aging, cancer, acute pancreatitis, and fatty liver disease. In addition, 
epigenetic regulatory mechanisms during stroke recovery have been reviewed, with 
focuses mainly on neural apoptosis, necrosis, and neuroplasticity. However, 
oxidative stress-induced epigenetic regulation in vascular neural networks 
following stroke has not been sufficiently explored. Improved understanding of 
the epigenetic regulatory network upon oxidative stress may provide effective 
antioxidant approaches for treating stroke. In this review, we summarize the 
epigenetic events, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and 
microRNAs, that result from oxidative stress following experimental stroke in 
animal and cell models, and the ways in which epigenetic changes and their 
crosstalk influence the redox state in neurons, glia, and vascular endothelial 
cells, helping us to understand the foregone and vicious epigenetic regulation 
of oxidative stress in the vascular neural network following stroke.

Parade, Cardiff, CF24 3AA Wales, UK.

One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the 
efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by 
the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life 
expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in 
case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting 
their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is 
costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place 
of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such 
as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing 
care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in 
telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity 
of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things 
(IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. 
The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time 
monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven 
intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, 
and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it 
is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to 
identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, 
therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and 
sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their 
objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our 
work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing 
immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors 
for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were 
often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as 
distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. 
There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the 
implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among 
groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems 
need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that has strong contribution of 
genetic factors to its etiology. We aimed to assess the genetic association 
between non-HLA genes and T1D in a Chinese case-control cohort recruited from 
multiple centers consisting of 364 patients with T1D and 719 unrelated healthy 
children. We genotyped 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers located 
in 16 non-HLA genes (VTCN1, PTPN22, CTLA4, SUMO4, CD274, IL2RA, INS, DHCR7, 
ERBB3, VDR, CYP27B1, CD69, CD276, PTPN2, UBASH3A, and IL2RB) using SNaPshot 
multiple single-base extension methods. After multivariate analysis and 
correction for multiple comparisons, we identified the SNP rs2292239 in ERBB3 
gene were significantly associated with T1D. The frequency of the major G allele 
was significantly decreased in patients with T1D (68.8% in T1D vs 77.3% in 
controls, OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79, P = 0.02), and the minor allele T was 
associated with an increased risk of T1D (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26-1.90, P = 0.02). 
Our haplotype analysis confirmed that rs2292239 was the primary T1D association 
locus in our current investigation. These results indicated that the 
ERBB3-rs2292239 was the primary T1D association locus among the investigated 55 
SNPs in 16 non-HLA genes in Chinese Han population.

In recent years the need for informal home care in European countries is growing 
quickly due to increased life expectancy and demographic change. Informal 
caregivers have to overcome many obstacles ranging from a lack of adequate 
training to misjudging their physical and psychological abilities. The aim of 
this project is to create a low cost wearable device, which unobtrusively 
measures the physical stress load on caregivers. Two parameters with the most 
impact on performance and well-being of the caregiver have been identified: (i) 
fatigue and (ii) back-stress. Based on the measurements, an alert is issued if 
caregivers are not performing a task correctly, or if they are overexerting 
themselves. This paper discusses the design of such device and description of an 
initial prototype, its advantages and possible further development and 
applications.

Drug-eluting stents remain the golden standard for below-the-knee occlusive 
disease.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a chronic condition; an increasing number 
of patients affected. Infrapopliteal disease is related to critical limb 
ischemia (CLI). Amputation-free survival in these situations is the goal to 
achieve; it is well-known that life expectancy and quality of live are reduced 
by this condition. PAD is rarely isolated in one anatomical region when a CLI 
condition exists. The endovascular approach to lower limb infrapopliteal disease 
(BTK) has been constantly increasing in the last years trying to prevent a 
potential amputation. Even with the current endovascular armamentarium, BTK 
disease remains challenging, long and even midterm results remain uncertain. The 
rationale behind using drug-eluting stent (DES) at BTK is similar to other 
regions; deal with elastic recoil, treat potential dissections, deliver drug to 
the intima to prevent restenosis and reduce late lumen loss. Current evidence 
comprehensive review of the latest published results has been performed as well 
a comparison with other available reviews and meta-analyses. There is an 
increasing evidence for the use of DES in BTK disease, multiple platforms with 
different drugs had been evaluated and some good initial results had been 
published and presented recently. The safety of DES used in BTK occlusive has 
been clearly proven over the different studies performed in the last years. Good 
primary patency has been reported for balloon expandable DES but available 
studies focused on short/focal lesions. Current results support the use of DES 
in BTK region when a stent is necessary (bail-out) or the total lesion length is 
short. There is a clear benefit for primary patency, potential clinical benefits 
and, under these conditions, DES treatment seems to be cost-effective. Further 
investigation and technology improvement is required to apply these good results 
to longer and more diffuse lesions.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Palliative pelvic radiotherapy (PPRT) is used to treat 
locally advanced rectal cancer (RC) although symptomatic effects and toxicities 
are poorly documented. Aims were to evaluate symptom severity, quality of life 
(QOL) and toxicity after PPRT.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with symptomatic primary or recurrent 
RC prescribed PPRT with fractions of 3 Gy to 30-39 Gy were included. Primary 
outcome was severity of target symptoms (TS) 12 weeks after PPRT. Pelvic symptom 
burden, toxicity, and QOL were assessed. Response was defined as 
patient-reported TS improvement or resolution.
RESULTS: Pain (n = 24), rectal dysfunction (n = 16), and hematochezia (n = 9) 
were the most common TSs. Overall response rate among evaluable patients 12 
weeks after PPRT was 28/33 (85%). Eighteen patients did not complete the study 
follow-up, 16 due to deteriorating health. TS responses were 10/13 (77%) for 
pain, 9/10 (90%) for rectal dysfunction, and 8/8 for hematochezia. Non-target 
pelvic symptom severity decreased and median QOL scores remained stable. There 
was no grade 4 toxicity. Median survival was nine months.
CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients with symptomatic primary or recurrent 
RC, PPRT with 30-39 Gy contributes to pelvic symptom relief, with little 
toxicity. Patients prescribed PPRT of RC have limited life expectancy. Future 
studies should investigate simplification of PPRT.
