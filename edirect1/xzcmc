INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy increases, the incidence of shoulder 
arthroplasty continues to increase as well. There are few shoulder arthroplasty 
studies investigating perioperative complication, readmission, and mortality. 
Furthermore, with bundled payments on the horizon, the cost of shoulder 
arthroplasty has become a significant issue. Clarifying risk factors for the 
need for postdischarge acute care will be critical information due to the high 
cost of such care. The goal of this study was to compare discharge disposition, 
length of stay (LOS), perioperative complications, readmission, and mortality in 
elderly and nonelderly cohorts to determine whether age is a risk factor for 
shoulder arthroplasty.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared 89 elderly patients (80 years 
or older) and 86 nonelderly patients (79 years or younger) who underwent 
hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, reverse total shoulder 
arthroplasty, or revision shoulder arthroplasty from 2007 to 2015. Baseline 
characteristics were compared between the 2 cohorts. We then compared discharge 
disposition, LOS, 90-day complication rate, readmission, and mortality between 
the 2 cohorts.
RESULTS: Average length of hospitalization and percentage of patients with 
greater than 2 days of hospitalization were significantly higher in the elderly 
cohorts. Forty-four percent of the elderly cohorts were discharged to a skilled 
nursing facility compared to 6% in the nonelderly cohorts (P < .0001). There 
were no significant differences found in 90-day major complication rate, 
readmission, or mortality.
DISCUSSION: Shoulder arthroplasty is a valuable surgery for various indications 
in the elderly population. However, the likelihood of a patient to need a 
prolonged hospitalization or skilled nursing facility care after surgery are 
important questions that need to be answered. Our study shows that age over 80 
years is a risk factor for prolonged hospitalization and need for skilled 
nursing facility care after shoulder arthroplasty.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that elderly patients who undergo shoulder arthroplasty 
are significantly more likely to have extended hospitalizations and to be 
discharged to skilled nursing facilities compared to nonelderly patients.

Adjuvant endocrine hormonal therapy (EHT) is highly effective and appropriate 
for nearly all breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors, 
which represent 75% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Long-term use of EHT reduces 
recurrence rates and nearly halves the risk of death during the second decade 
after diagnosis. Despite the proven benefits, about 33% of women receiving EHT 
do not take their medication as prescribed. This causes an increase in the risk 
for recurrence and death. To promote adherence to EHT among breast cancer 
patients, this study will develop and pilot-test an intervention consisting of 
1) a bilingual, culturally tailored, personalized, interactive smartphone 
application (app); and 2) support from a patient navigator. The control group 
will receive usual care. This 2-group randomized control trial will recruit 120 
breast cancer patients receiving EHT at the Mays Cancer Center at UT Health San 
Antonio. The two-year study will have 3-time assessments (baseline, 3 and 6 
months). This theory-based intervention will empower patients' self-monitoring 
and management. It will facilitate patient education, identification/reporting 
of side effects, delivery of self-care advice, and simplify communication 
between the patient and the oncology team. The ultimate goal of this innovative 
multi-communication intervention is to improve overall survival and life 
expectancy, enhance quality of life, reduce recurrence, and decrease healthcare 
cost. The anticipated outcome is a scalable, evidence-based, and easily 
disseminated intervention with potentially broad use to patients using EHT and 
other oral anticancer agents.

BACKGROUND: The interwar period was a time of comprehensive preventive health 
programmes in Norway. Physical exercise, nutritious diets, strict sleep regimens 
and better hygiene were at the centre of these efforts. A massive mobilisation 
of volunteers and professionals took place. The publication of House Maxims for 
Mothers and Children was part of this large-scale mobilisation, and consisted of 
ten posters with pithy health advice for hanging on the wall. Mothers were an 
important target group for health promotion.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The posters have previously received little attention in 
medical literature, but they can elucidate some features of life and the health 
propaganda of their time. We have used databases that provide access to 
newspapers, books and medical literature: Retriever, bokhylla.no, Oria, PubMed 
and Web of Science.
RESULTS: It is hard to quantify the effect of this popular movement when 
compared to political measures to improve living conditions. In any case, 
mortality rates fell, life expectancy increased and the dreaded communicable 
diseases were largely defeated. Special efforts were targeted at children, also 
with good results. Infant mortality fell and schoolchildren became healthier, 
stronger, taller and cleaner.
INTERPRETATION: The line between social hygiene and general disciplining is 
blurred, for example the boundary between a healthy diet and bourgeois norms. 
The education of mothers and children also included a normative aspect that 
concerned good manners and control.

In France, benzodiazepine (BZD) is frequently prescribed in elderly people (EP). 
Long-term efficacy is often questioned, and treatment has to be regularly 
re-examined, especially in EP. In our Geriatric day-hospital for assessment of 
frailty, a multidisciplinary team evaluates the patients and gives them 
preventative measures against the loss of autonomy. Medication evaluation is 
part of these measures. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of a 
standardized intervention on the optimization of BZD treatment. Setting and 
method: After a short interview and the delivery of an information booklet about 
BZD, patients were proposed an optimization of their BZD treatment (dosage 
reduction, occasional medication, switch to a short half-life BZD, or total 
discontinuation). Patients were followed up monthly by a phone-interview over a 
6-months period. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of BZD optimized 
treatments after a 6 months follow-up. Results: 18 patients were included. Among 
them, 50% have been taking a BZD for more than 10 years, and 39% were prescribed 
a long half-life BZD, which can be qualified as inappropriate in EP. 50% of the 
subjects were frail and 44% pre-frail, according to the Fried criteria. At the 
end of the study, 33% of the patients had their BZD treatments optimized, 
including 17% of total discontinuation. Conclusion: In the frail elderly 
population, a standardized intervention can be useful to improve BZD treatment. 
An extension to this intervention would be the creation of an organization 
tasked with routinely monitoring the patients' withdrawal over a six month 
period.

Helicoverpa gelotopoeon is an endemic pest of South America that affects soybean 
and other important crops. Life tables are a fundamental tool used to study 
insect populations, resulting in crucial information for integrated pest 
management programs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the biotic 
potential and the construction of a life table of this species under laboratory 
conditions. The biological parameters that showed significant differences 
between male and female were pupal duration, longevity and life span, which were 
all longer in duration for males. The net reproductive rate (R0) was 95.49, the 
mean generation time (T) 37.53, and the instantaneous rate of population 
increase "r" 0.12. The population doubling time (DT) was 5.70 days, and the 
daily finite rate of increase (λ) 1.13. The maximum rate of population growth 
occurred in the day 33. Fecundity had two peaks: at days 35 and 37. Gross and 
net fecundity rate, and the average number of eggs laid per female per day were 
565.87, 496.07, and 18.76 respectively. The biotic potential was 2.026 x 1018 
individuals/female/year. The survivorship curve showed that mortality was high 
during incubation period and first larval instars, then it declined until the 
death of last adult. These results provide important information to develop 
management strategies of H. gelotopoeon in South America.

BACKGROUND: Economic evaluations which estimate cost-effectiveness of potential 
treatments can guide decisions about real-world healthcare services. We 
performed an economic evaluation of a healthy lifestyle intervention targeting 
weight loss, physical activity and diet for patients with chronic low back pain, 
who are overweight or obese.
METHODS: Eligible patients with chronic low back pain (n = 160) were randomized 
to an intervention or usual care control group. The intervention included brief 
advice, a clinical consultation and referral to a 6-month telephone-based 
healthy lifestyle coaching service. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, disability, weight 
and body mass index. Costs included intervention costs, healthcare utilization 
costs and work absenteeism costs. An economic analysis was performed from the 
societal perspective.
RESULTS: Mean total costs were lower in the intervention group than the control 
group (-$614; 95%CI: -3133 to 255). The intervention group had significantly 
lower healthcare costs (-$292; 95%CI: -872 to -33), medication costs (-$30; 
95%CI: -65 to -4) and absenteeism costs (-$1,000; 95%CI: -3573 to -210). For all 
outcomes, the intervention was on average less expensive and more effective than 
usual care, and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective 
compared to usual care was relatively high (i.e., 0.81) at a willingness-to-pay 
of $0/unit of effect. However, the probability of cost-effectiveness was not as 
favourable among sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The healthy lifestyle intervention seems to be cost-effective from 
the societal perspective. However, variability in the sensitivity analyses 
indicates caution is needed when interpreting these findings.
SIGNIFICANCE: This is an economic evaluation of a randomized controlled trial of 
a healthy lifestyle intervention for chronic low back pain. The findings suggest 
that a healthy lifestyle intervention may be cost-effective relative to usual 
care.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to review the recent progress in 
xenotransplantation achieved through genetic engineering and discuss the 
potential of tolerance induction to overcome remaining barriers to extended 
xenograft survival.
RECENT FINDINGS: The success of life-saving allotransplantation has created a 
demand for organ transplantation that cannot be met by the supply of human 
organs. Xenotransplantation is one possible solution that would allow for a 
nearly unlimited supply of organs. Recent genetic engineering of swine has 
decreased the reactivity of preformed antibodies to some, but not all, potential 
human recipients. Experiments using genetically modified swine organs have now 
resulted in survival of life-supporting kidneys for over a year. However, the 
grafts show evidence of antibody-mediated rejection on histology, suggesting 
additional measures will be required for further extension of graft survival. 
Tolerance induction through mixed chimerism or thymic transplantation across 
xenogeneic barriers would be well suited for patients with a positive crossmatch 
to genetically modified swine or relatively negative crossmatches to genetically 
modified swine, respectively.
SUMMARY: This review highlights the current understanding of the immunologic 
processes in xenotransplantation and describes the development and application 
of strategies designed to overcome them from the genetic modification of the 
source animal to the induction of tolerance to xenografts.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the causes of inpatient mortality in hospitals is 
important for monitoring the population health and evidence-based planning for 
curative and public health care. Dearth of information on causes and trends of 
hospital mortality in most countries of Sub-Saharan Africa has resulted to wide 
use of model-based estimation methods which are characterized by estimation 
errors. This retrospective analysis used primary data to determine the 
cause-specific mortality patterns among inpatient hospital deaths in Tanzania 
from 2006-2015.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was carried out from July to December 2016 
and involved 39 hospitals in Tanzania. A review of hospital in-patient death 
registers and report forms was done to cover a period of 10 years. Information 
collected included demographic characteristics of the deceased and immediate 
underlying cause of death. Causes of death were coded using international 
classification of diseases (ICD)-10. Data were analysed to provide information 
on cause-specific, trends and distribution of death by demographic and 
geographical characteristics.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 247,976 deaths were captured over a 10-year 
period. The median age at death was 30 years, interquartile range (IQR) 1, 50. 
The five leading causes of death were malaria (12.75%), respiratory diseases 
(10.08%), HIV/AIDS (8.04%), anaemia (7.78%) and cardio-circulatory diseases 
(6.31%). From 2006 to 2015, there was a noted decline in the number of deaths 
due to malaria (by 47%), HIV/AIDS (28%) and tuberculosis (26%). However, there 
was an increase in number of deaths due to neonatal disorders by 128%. Malaria 
and anaemia killed more infants and children under 5 years while HIV/AIDS and 
Tuberculosis accounted for most of the deaths among adults.
CONCLUSION: The leading causes of inpatient hospital death were malaria, 
respiratory diseases, HIV/AIDS, anaemia and cardio-circulatory diseases. Death 
among children under 5 years has shown an increasing trend. The observed trends 
in mortality indicates that the country is lagging behind towards attaining the 
global and national goals for sustainable development. The increasing pattern of 
respiratory diseases, cancers and septicaemia requires immediate attention of 
the health system.

BACKGROUND: Interventions that can facilitate early diagnosis of age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) will facilitate early treatment and improve clinical 
outcomes but there has been concerns about additional medical costs to the 
health care system. An examination through a retina fundus photography by a 
non-specialist has been suggested as a potential cost-effective alternative to a 
direct examination by a specialist, but limited scientific data exists on the 
cost-effectiveness of screening strategies for AMD. Our objective is to conduct 
an economic evaluation of various population-wide screening strategies for AMD 
among the South Korean population.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a Markov cohort model, we evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of four AMD screening strategies (opportunistic examination, 
opportunistic treatment, systematic photography, and systematic examination) in 
comparison with status quo (no screening) for South Korean adults. We projected 
a life time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100,00 persons of age 40 
with and without AMD at baseline. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained, cost from the societal perspective, and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each strategy. Interventions were 
evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30,000,000 KRW ($27,538) 
per QALY gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to address the model uncertainty. Opportunistic examination was 
strongly dominated because it generated fewer expected QALYs but incurred 
greater expected cost than the other screening strategies. The mean lifetime 
expected costs were 289,013 KRW, 363,692 KRW, 9,351,964 KRW, and 12,309,783 KRW, 
and the mean QALYs gained were 37.73, 37.75, 40.47, 40.68, for no screening, 
opportunistic treatment, systematic photography, and systematic examination, 
respectively. The results were most sensitive to the utility weight of mild AMD, 
the probability of complication from treatment, the cost of being in mild AMD, 
and the probability of recovery from complication. After eliminating the two 
weakly dominated strategies, systematic photography was cost-effective at the 
ICER of 3,310,448 KRW per QALY in comparison to status quo.
CONCLUSIONS: Under the WTP threshold of 30,000,000 KRW per QALY, systematic 
photography is cost-effective for screening AMD in South Korean adults. 
Systematic examination by ophthalmologists generates more expected QALY and cost 
compared to systematic photography.

OBJECTIVES: The surgical correction of pectus excavatum (PE) with a Nuss bar 
provides satisfactory outcomes, but its cost-effectiveness is yet unproven. We 
prospectively analysed early outcomes and costs for Nuss bar placement.
METHODS: Fifty-four patients aged 16 years or older (6 females and 48 males; 
mean age, 17.9 years; range 16.0-29.4 years) with a PE filled out a Short 
Form-36 Health Survey (SF-6D) preoperatively and 1 year after a Nuss procedure. 
Costs included professional fees and fees for the operating room, materials and 
hospital care. Changes in the responses to the SF-36 or its domains were 
compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the utility test results were 
calculated preoperatively and postoperatively from the SF-6D. The 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the results of these 
tests.
RESULTS: Significant improvements in physical functioning, social functioning, 
mental health and health transition (all P < 0.05) were noted. The other SF-36 
subgroups showed improvement; however, the improvement was not significant. The 
SF-6D utility showed improvement from 0.76 preoperatively to 0.79 at the 1-year 
follow-up (P = 0.096). The mean direct costs were €8805. The 1-year discounted 
QALY gain was 0.03. The estimated cost-utility ratio was €293 500 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant improvement in many domains of the SF-36, the 
results of the SF-6D cost-utility analysis showed only a small improvement in 
cost-effectiveness (> €80 000/QALY) for patients with PE 1 year after Nuss bar 
placement. Based on this discrepancy, general health outcome measurements as the 
basis for cost-utility analysis in patients with PE may not be the best way 
forward.

OBJECTIVES: Social anxiety disorder is one of the most prevalent mental 
disorders and often manifests in youth or adolescence. Our aim was to determine 
direct costs of adolescents with social anxiety disorder and the 
cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic 
therapy (PDT) compared to waiting list (WL).
METHODS: Baseline data (n = 103) of a randomized controlled trial was used to 
determine direct costs. Cost-effectiveness of CBT and PDT compared to WL was 
analyzed using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the EQ-5D index as 
measure of health effects.
RESULTS: Total six-month direct costs were 809 € (SE 508 €). Especially costs of 
outpatient physician treatment (325 €; SE 301 €) and psychiatric hospital stays 
(377 €; SE 258 €) were high. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
CBT compared to WL was 18,824 €/QALY, with a probability of 63 % for the ICER 
being below 50,000 €/QALY. PDT did not prove to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct costs were mainly caused by psychiatric hospital stays and 
outpatient physician treatments. CBT is likely to be cost-effective compared to 
WL, whereas PDT is unlikely to be cost-effective.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND: Ziel war die Analyse direkter Kosten sozialer 
Angststörung (SAD) bei Jugendlichen und der Kosteneffektivität von CBT bzw. PDT.
METHODEN: Multizentrische randomisierte Studie mit N = 103 Patienten. 
Krankheitskosten wurden zur Baseline und Kosteneffektivität nach der Behandlung 
analysiert.
ERGEBNISSE: Direkte 6-Monats-Kosten zu Baseline lagen bei 809 €. Während die 
inkrementelle Kosten-Effektivitäts-Relation von CBT im Vergleich zur Warteliste 
bei 18 824 €/QALY lag, war PDT nicht kosteneffektiv.
ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: SAD verursacht hohe direkte Kosten. CBT ist wahrscheinlich 
kosteneffektiv.

Higher life expectancy is increasing the number of age-related cognitive 
impairment cases. It is also relevant, as some authors claim, that physical 
exercise may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to improve cognition and 
memory after strokes. Thus, the integration of physical and cognitive therapies 
could offer potential benefits. In addition, in general these therapies are 
usually considered boring, so it is important to include some features that 
improve the motivation of patients. As a result, computer-assisted cognitive 
rehabilitation systems and serious games for health are more and more present. 
In order to achieve a continuous, efficient and sustainable rehabilitation of 
patients, they will have to be carried out as part of the rehabilitation in 
their own home. However, current home systems lack the therapist's presence, and 
this leads to two major challenges for such systems. First, they need sensors 
and actuators that compensate for the absence of the therapist's eyes and hands. 
Second, the system needs to capture and apply the therapist's expertise. With 
this aim, and based on our previous proposals, we propose an ambient 
intelligence environment for cognitive rehabilitation at home, combining 
physical and cognitive activities, by implementing a Fuzzy Inference System 
(FIS) that gathers, as far as possible, the knowledge of a rehabilitation 
expert. Moreover, smart sensors and actuators will attempt to make up for the 
absence of the therapist. Furthermore, the proposed system will feature a remote 
monitoring tool, so that the therapist can supervise the patients' exercises. 
Finally, an evaluation will be presented where experts in the rehabilitation 
field showed their satisfaction with the proposed system.

Latin American and the Caribbean countries exhibit high life expectancy and 
projections show that they will experience the fastest growth of older people in 
the following years. As people live longer, it is important to maximise the 
opportunity to age healthily. We aimed to examine the associations of lifestyle 
behaviours with healthy ageing in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Mexico and 
Puerto Rico, part of the 10/66 study. Residents 65 years old and over (n = 
10,900) were interviewed between 2003 and 2010. In the baseline survey, we 
measured four healthy behaviours: Physical activity, non-smoking, moderate 
drinking and fruits or vegetables consumption. Healthy ageing was conceptualised 
within the functional ability framework over a median of 4 years follow-up. 
Logistic models were calculated per country and then pooled together with 
fixed-effects meta-analysis. People engaging in physical activity and consuming 
fruits or vegetables had increased odds of healthy ageing in the follow-up (OR: 
2.59, 95% CI: 2.20⁻3.03; OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.06⁻1.44, respectively). Compared 
with participants engaging in none or one healthy behaviour, the ORs of 
participants engaging in two, three or four healthy behaviours increased in a 
linear way (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.40⁻1.84; OR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.94⁻2.69; OR: 2.46, 
95% CI: 1.54⁻3.92, respectively). Our findings highlight the importance of 
awareness of a healthy lifestyle behaviour among older people.

OBJECTIVE: To examine mortality and associated risk factors, including possible 
effects of mild cognitive impairment, imaging, and CSF abnormalities, in a 
community-based population with incident parkinsonism and Parkinson disease.
METHODS: One hundred eighty-two patients with new-onset, idiopathic parkinsonism 
were diagnosed from January 2004 through April 2009, in a catchment area of 
142,000 inhabitants in Sweden. Patients were comprehensively investigated 
according to a multimodal research protocol and followed prospectively for up to 
13.5 years. A total of 109 patients died. Mortality rates in the general Swedish 
population were used to calculate standardized mortality ratio and expected 
survival, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate 
independent predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: The standardized mortality ratio for all patients was 1.84 (95% 
confidence interval 1.50-2.22, p < 0.001). Patients with atypical parkinsonism 
(multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy) had the highest 
mortality. In early Parkinson disease, a mild cognitive impairment diagnosis, 
freezing of gait, hyposmia, reduced dopamine transporter activity in the 
caudate, and elevated leukocytes in the CSF were significantly associated with 
shorter survival.
CONCLUSION: Although patients presenting with idiopathic parkinsonism have 
reduced survival, the survival is highly dependent on the type and 
characteristics of the parkinsonian disorder. Patients with Parkinson disease 
presenting with normal cognitive function seem to have a largely normal life 
expectancy. The finding of a subtle CSF leukocytosis in patients with Parkinson 
disease with short survival may have clinical implications.

INTRODUCTION: Asthma is a prevalent disease in both children and adults. 
Significant progress in the management of asthma and prevention of asthmatic 
attacks resulted in a reduction of asthma deaths, but there is a variation among 
different regions based on health-care access and environmental factors. We 
aimed to investigate the trend of asthma mortality during a 10-year period in 
Yazd Province, a region in the center of Iran.
METHODS: We obtained our data from the death registry of Yazd health center. 
This registry collects data from hospitals, clinics, forensic medicine 
department, and cemeteries. All deaths due to asthma from 2002 to 2011 were 
included in our study. We used the remaining life expectancy of each person at 
death and sex group to calculate the years of life lost (YLL) due to asthma.
RESULTS: Nearly 10,371 years of life was lost due to asthma in our study (M/F 
ratio of 1.29). Asthma mortality rate increased with age, rising sharply after 
age 50. Average YLL per death was 18.6 years. Asthma mortality rate decreased 
from 6.66/100,000 in 2002 to 3.97 in 2011. YLL from asthma among men decreased 
from 796 in 2002 to 338 in 2011, but among women, it showed an increase from 335 
to 534 at the same time.
CONCLUSION: The trend of reduction in asthma mortality is not similar between 
different age and gender groups. Further studies are needed to determine the 
cause of increasing trend among more vulnerable groups.

Sunitinib has been shown to offer clinical benefits during the treatment of 
advanced renal cell carcinoma. However, molecular targeting drugs are expensive 
and can have a significant impact on medical expenses. The purpose of this study 
was to assess the cost-effectiveness of sunitinib as a first-line therapy 
compared with interferon-alpha (IFN-α) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
patients. A Markov model was used to show the clinical courses of patients with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma who received sunitinib or IFN-α. The transition 
probabilities and utilities employed in this Markov model were derived from two 
sources. This study focused on the perspective of public healthcare payer, as 
only direct medical costs were estimated from the treatment schedule for 
metastatic renal cell cancer. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, outcomes were 
valued in terms of life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We 
calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) during the 
cost-effectiveness analysis. The results were tested using Monte Carlo 
simulations. Sunitinib and IFN-α treatment resulted in LYs of 2.40 years and 
2.03 years, QALYs of 1.58 and 1.25, and expected costs of 13,572,629 yen and 
6,083,002 yen, respectively. As a result, the ICER associated with replacing 
IFN-α with sunitinib was 22,695,839 yen/QALYs. Our results suggest that compared 
with IFN-α, sunitinib prolongs LYs and QALYs, but the increases in quality 
achieved by sunitinib are more expensive than those produced by IFN-α.

BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is a common and frequently fatal 
infection. Adjunctive rifampicin may enhance early S. aureus killing, sterilise 
infected foci and blood faster, and thereby reduce the risk of dissemination, 
metastatic infection and death.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not adjunctive rifampicin reduces 
bacteriological (microbiologically confirmed) failure/recurrence or death 
through 12 weeks from randomisation. Secondary objectives included evaluating 
the impact of rifampicin on all-cause mortality, clinically defined 
failure/recurrence or death, toxicity, resistance emergence, and duration of 
bacteraemia; and assessing the cost-effectiveness of rifampicin.
DESIGN: Parallel-group, randomised (1 : 1), blinded, placebo-controlled 
multicentre trial.
SETTING: UK NHS trust hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult inpatients (≥ 18 years) with meticillin-resistant or 
susceptible S. aureus grown from one or more blood cultures, who had received 
< 96 hours of antibiotic therapy for the current infection, and without 
contraindications to rifampicin.
INTERVENTIONS: Adjunctive rifampicin (600-900 mg/day, oral or intravenous) or 
placebo for 14 days in addition to standard antibiotic therapy. Investigators 
and patients were blinded to trial treatment. Follow-up was for 12 weeks 
(assessments at 3, 7, 10 and 14 days, weekly until discharge and final 
assessment at 12 weeks post randomisation).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause bacteriological 
(microbiologically confirmed) failure/recurrence or death through 12 weeks from 
randomisation.
RESULTS: Between December 2012 and October 2016, 758 eligible participants from 
29 UK hospitals were randomised: 370 to rifampicin and 388 to placebo. The 
median age was 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) 50-76 years]. A total of 485 
(64.0%) infections were community acquired and 132 (17.4%) were nosocomial; 47 
(6.2%) were caused by meticillin-resistant S. aureus. A total of 301 (39.7%) 
participants had an initial deep infection focus. Standard antibiotics were 
given for a median of 29 days (IQR 18-45 days) and 619 (81.7%) participants 
received flucloxacillin. By 12 weeks, 62 out of 370 (16.8%) patients taking 
rifampicin versus 71 out of 388 (18.3%) participants taking the placebo 
experienced bacteriological (microbiologically confirmed) failure/recurrence or 
died [absolute risk difference -1.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.0% to 
4.3%; hazard ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.35; p = 0.81]. There were 4 (1.1%) and 
5 (1.3%) bacteriological failures (p = 0.82) in the rifampicin and placebo 
groups, respectively. There were 3 (0.8%) versus 16 (4.1%) bacteriological
