PURPOSE: The Stereotactic Ablative Radiation therapy for Comprehensive Treatment 
of Oligometastatic Tumors phase 2 randomized clinical trial found that 
stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) improved outcomes among cancer 
patients with oligometastatic disease. Yet, the cost of SABR along with the 
large number of patients with oligometastatic disease raises the important 
question of value. This study sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
addition of SABR compared with standard therapy alone among cancer patients with 
oligometastatic disease.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate treatment with 
stereotactic ablative radiation therapy or standard therapy among patients with 
oligometastatic cancers. The model derived transition probabilities from 
Stereotactic Ablative Radiation therapy for Comprehensive Treatment of 
Oligometastatic Tumors clinical trial data to estimate risks of toxicity, 
disease progression and survival. Health care costs and health utilities were 
estimated from the literature. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses 
evaluate model uncertainty. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from both the 
health care sector and societal perspectives with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) defined as dollars per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY). An ICER less than $100,000/QALY was considered cost-effective. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to examine model 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: The addition of SABR increased total costs by $54,260 (health care 
sector perspective) or $72,799 (societal perspective) and improved effectiveness 
by 1.88 QALYs compared with standard therapy, leading to an ICER of $28,906/QALY 
(health care sector perspective) or $38,783/QALY (societal perspective). The 
model was modestly sensitive to assumptions about tumor progression, although 
the model was not sensitive to assumptions about survival or cost of treatment. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that SABR was the cost-effective 
treatment option 99.8% (health care sector perspective) or 98.7% (societal 
perspective) of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of SABR increased costs and improved quality adjusted 
survival, overall leading to a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients 
with oligometastatic cancer.

A cryogel-based semi-interpenetrating polymer network (Cryo-SIPN) was prepared 
in which conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy) 
were formed within the super porous network of acrylic acid cryogel. For 
completion of cryo-polymerization, all the constituent solutions were severely 
mixed and placed into the plastic straws and kept at -20°C and then the 
synthesized cyrogels were cut into the 1-cm length and freeze dried after 
washing with water. The Cryo-SIPN polymeric composite was applied in micro solid 
phase extraction (µSPE) of some selected antibiotic residues from various 
samples. The µSPE method combined with a high performance liquid 
chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) system allowed trace quantification of 
antibiotic residues in the honey and water samples while the significant 
variables were optimized using a central composite design (CCD) to find optimum 
conditions. The method performance was satisfactory with recovery ranges from 
70.0 to 109%. The limits of detection (S/N = 3) and quantification (S/N = 10) 
for all samples were within the 17-50 μg kg-1 and 47-140 μg kg-1 range, 
respectively. The relative standard deviation was less than 10 % for antibiotics 
in the foodstuff and water samples. The validated Cryo-SIPN-µSPE in conjunction 
with HPLC-UV, proved to be versatile, efficient and robust while its capability 
toward the trace determination of drugs residues in real-life samples is 
demonstrated in this work.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy has increased over the past century, causing a shift 
in the demographic distribution toward older age groups. Elderly patients 
comprise up to 14% of all patients with pituitary tumors, with most lesions 
being nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). Here, the authors evaluated 
demographics, outcomes, and postoperative complications between nonelderly adult 
and elderly NFPA patients.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 908 patients undergoing transsphenoidal 
surgery (TSS) for NFPA at a single institution from 2007 to 2019 was conducted. 
Clinical and surgical outcomes and postoperative complications were compared 
between nonelderly adult (age ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years) and elderly patients (age > 
65 years).
RESULTS: There were 614 and 294 patients in the nonelderly and elderly groups, 
respectively. Both groups were similar in sex (57.3% vs 60.5% males; p = 0.4), 
tumor size (2.56 vs 2.46 cm; p = 0.2), and cavernous sinus invasion (35.8% vs 
33.7%; p = 0.6). Regarding postoperative outcomes, length of stay (1 vs 2 days; 
p = 0.5), extent of resection (59.8% vs 64.8% gross-total resection; p = 0.2), 
CSF leak requiring surgical revision (4.3% vs 1.4%; p = 0.06), 30-day 
readmission (8.1% vs 7.3%; p = 0.7), infection (3.1% vs 2.0%; p = 0.5), and new 
hypopituitarism (13.9% vs 12.0%; p = 0.3) were similar between both groups. 
Elderly patients were less likely to receive adjuvant radiation (8.7% vs 16.3%; 
p = 0.009), undergo future reoperation (3.8% vs 9.5%; p = 0.003), and experience 
postoperative diabetes insipidus (DI) (3.7% vs 9.4%; p = 0.002), and more likely 
to have postoperative hyponatremia (26.7% vs 16.4%; p < 0.001) and new cranial 
nerve deficit (1.9% vs 0.0%; p = 0.01). Subanalysis of elderly patients showed 
that patients with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores had comparable 
outcomes other than higher DI rates (8.1% vs 0.0%; p = 0.006). Elderly patients' 
postoperative sodium peaked and troughed on postoperative day 3 (POD3) (mean 
138.7 mEq/L) and POD9 (mean 130.8 mEq/L), respectively, compared with nonelderly 
patients (peak POD2: mean 139.9 mEq/L; trough POD8: mean 131.3 mEq/L).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' analysis revealed that TSS for NFPA in elderly 
patients is safe with low complication rates. In this cohort, more elderly 
patients experienced postoperative hyponatremia, while more nonelderly patients 
experienced postoperative DI. These findings, combined with the observation of 
higher DI in patients with more comorbidities and elderly patients experiencing 
later peaks and troughs in serum sodium, suggest age-related differences in 
sodium regulation after NFPA resection. The authors hope that their results will 
help guide discussions with elderly patients regarding risks and outcomes of 
TSS.

Besta," Milan, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: Intracranial meningiomas (ICMs) may be diagnosed in octogenarians. 
Since the lesions are rarely life-threatening, surgery is a questionable choice 
in this age group. The authors' aim in this study was to analyze factors 
associated with the extent of resection (EOR), overall survival (OS), and 
postoperative complications in octogenarians undergoing ICM surgery, by using a 
cohort of septuagenarians as a reference.
METHODS: All patients ≥ 70 years of age who underwent surgery at Oslo University 
Hospital for an ICM between 1990 and 2010 were included in this study. Data on 
these cases were retrospectively (1990-2002) and prospectively (2003-2010) 
acquired from a databank belonging to Oslo University Hospital. All related 
preoperative imaging studies or reports (earlier cases) were reviewed to confirm 
tumor location, the presence of bone invasion, and the postoperative EOR.
RESULTS: In this study, 49 octogenarians (29 females [59.2%], mean age 83.3 ± 
2.5 years) were compared with 272 septuagenarians (173 females [63.6%], mean age 
74.3 ± 2.7 years). Forty octogenarians (81.6%) and 217 septuagenarians (79.8%) 
underwent gross-total resection. Simpson grade IV resection was achieved in 9 
octogenarians (18.4%) and 4 septuagenarians (1.4%), while Simpson grade V 
resection was obtained in 4 septuagenarians (1.4%). Postoperative complications 
were similar in both groups, and 4 octogenarians (8.2%) and 11 septuagenarians 
(4.1%) died within 30 days after surgery (p = 0.25). No octogenarian underwent 
adjuvant radiotherapy. The OS was 4.2 ± 2.8 years in the octogenarians and 5.8 ± 
4.4 years in the septuagenarians (p < 0.001). Female sex (OR 0.36, 95% CI 
0.14-0.93; p = 0.03) and a preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale score ≥ 70 
(OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.72; p = 0.009) were correlated to the OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarians undergoing surgery for ICMs had an overall reduced OS 
compared to septuagenarians. However, the clinical relevance of this difference 
in OS is debatable and has to be put in perspective with expected survival 
without surgery. Data on symptoms upon admission, EOR, invasive tumor features, 
and postoperative complications in octogenarians are similar to those observed 
in septuagenarians. Therefore, the decision concerning whether surgery should be 
performed must be based on a case-by-case discussion, and surgery should not be 
immediately dismissed when it comes to ICMs in octogenarians.

Women remain underrepresented within academic medicine despite past and present 
efforts to promote gender equity. The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic 
could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and 
limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women 
faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place 
and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household 
labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable 
to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain 
academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance 
with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender 
differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of 
the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, 
and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to 
virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, 
initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose 
key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To 
ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors 
call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women 
faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and 
inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs 
assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock-extension offers; more 
opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and 
financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these 
efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders 
should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid 
overburdening women faculty with additional service work. Together, these 
strategies will contribute to the development of a more equitable workforce 
capable of transformative medical discovery and care.

OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence supports the Awakening and Breathing Coordination, 
Delirium monitoring/management, and Early exercise/mobility (ABCDE) bundle 
processes as improving a number of short- and long-term clinical outcomes for 
patients requiring ICU care. To assess the cost-effectiveness of this 
intervention, we determined the impact of ABCDE bundle adherence on inpatient 
and 1-year mortality, quality-adjusted life-years, length of stay, and costs of 
care.
DESIGN: We conducted a 2-year, prospective, cost-effectiveness study in 12 adult 
ICUs in six hospitals belonging to a large, integrated healthcare delivery 
system.
SETTING: Hospitals included a large, urban tertiary referral center and five 
community hospitals. ICUs included medical/surgical, trauma, neurologic, and 
cardiac care units.
PATIENTS: The study included 2,953 patients, 18 years old or older, with an ICU 
stay greater than 24 hours, who were on a ventilator for more than 24 hours and 
less than 14 days.
INTERVENTION: ABCDE bundle.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used propensity score-adjusted regression 
models to determine the impact of high bundle adherence on inpatient mortality, 
discharge status, length of stay, and costs. A Markov model was used to estimate 
the potential effect of improved bundle adherence on healthcare costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years in the year following ICU admission. We found that 
patients with high ABCDE bundle adherence (≥ 60%) had significantly decreased 
odds of inpatient mortality (odds ratio 0.28) and significantly higher costs 
($3,920) of inpatient care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of high 
bundle adherence was $15,077 (95% CI, $13,675-$16,479) per life saved and $1,057 
per life-year saved. High bundle adherence was associated with a 0.12 increase 
in quality-adjusted life-years, a $4,949 increase in 1-year care costs, and an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $42,120 per quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: The ABCDE bundle appears to be a cost-effective means to reduce 
in-hospital and 1-year mortality for patients with an ICU stay.

Fish and other seafood products have a limited shelf life due to favorable 
conditions for microbial growth and enzymatic alterations. Various preservation 
and/or processing methods have been developed for shelf-life extension and for 
maintaining the quality of such highly perishable products. Freezing and frozen 
storage are among the most commonly applied techniques for this purpose. 
However, frozen-thawed fish or meat are less preferred by consumers; thus, 
labeling thawed products as fresh is considered a fraudulent practice. To detect 
this kind of fraud, several techniques and approaches (e.g., enzymatic, 
histological) have been commonly employed. While these methods have proven 
successful, they are not without limitations. In recent years, different 
emerging methods have been investigated to be used in place of other traditional 
detection methods of thawed products. In this context, spectroscopic techniques 
have received considerable attention due to their potential as being rapid and 
non-destructive analytical tools. This review paper aims to summarize studies 
that investigated the potential of emerging techniques, particularly those based 
on spectroscopy in combination with chemometric tools, to detect frozen-thawed 
muscle foods.

BACKGROUND: Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires are used to describe the impact 
of aphasia on stroke survivors' life. People with aphasia (PWA) are 
traditionally excluded from research, potentially leading to a mismatch between 
the factors chosen in the tools and the realistic needs of PWA. The purpose of 
this review was to determine the direct involvement of PWA in the creation of 
QoL and aphasia impact-related questionnaires (AIR-Qs).
METHODS: A scoping review methodology was conducted by an expert librarian and 
two independent reviewers on health sciences based on the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Metanalyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) protocol, through a literature search in five databases: Medline 
Complete, PubMed, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Search terms included 
'stroke', 'people with aphasia', 'communication', 'well-being', and 'quality of 
life'.
RESULTS: Of 952 results, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria. Of these, only 
four AIR-Qs studies (20%) were found reporting the direct involvement of PWA, 
while no QoL tools did so. Evidence showed involvement in the creation phase of 
AIR-Q, mainly in a consultation role.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an absence of a framework for conducting and reporting the 
involvement of PWA in qualitative participatory research studies, which limits 
effectiveness to promote equitable best practice in aphasia rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) is widely used for malignant 
colorectal obstruction. Recently, SEMS has been used for palliative option for 
colorectal obstruction caused by extracolonic malignancy (ECM).
AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of SEMS for colorectal obstruction caused by ECM, 
and to identify the factors associated with stent occlusion.
METHODS: Seventy-two patients who were treated with uncovered SEMS insertion for 
malignant colorectal obstructions caused by colorectal metastasis or peritoneal 
seeding of ECM at Samsung Medical Center between April 2012 to March 2016 were 
enrolled. We analyzed technical and clinical outcomes of stent insertion, the 
factors associated with stent occlusion and long term outcomes after stent 
insertion.
RESULTS: Technical success rate was determined as 90.3% with a clinical success 
rate of 87.7%. Stent occlusion developed in 28.1%, with a median duration of 51 
d. Further, 81.3% with stent occlusion could be treated with secondary stent 
insertion. Clinical failure was observed to be related to the male sex (P = 
0.020) and right colon obstruction (P = 0.017). Stent length ≤ 10 cm was found 
to be associated with stent occlusion (P = 0.003). Median survival time after 
stent insertion was 4.7 mo and 40.4% were able to receive their oncological 
treatments after stent insertion without surgery.
CONCLUSION: Uncovered SEMS is effective for the treatment of colorectal 
obstruction caused by ECM, considering life expectancy of patients with ECM.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study provides an annually 
updated resource to study disease-related morbidity and mortality worldwide.
OBJECTIVES: Here we present the burden estimates for atopic dermatitis (AD), 
including data from inception of the GBD project in 1990 until 2017.
METHODS: Data on the burden of AD were obtained from the GBD Study.
RESULTS: Atopic dermatitis (AD) ranks 15th among all nonfatal diseases and has 
the highest disease burden among skin diseases as measured by 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Overall, the global DALY rate for AD in 
1990 was 121 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 65·4-201] and remained similar in 
2017 at 123 (95% UI 66·8-205). The three countries with the highest DALY rates 
of AD were Sweden (327, 95% UI 178-547), the UK (284, 95% UI 155-478) and 
Iceland (277, 95% UI 149-465), whereas Uzbekistan (85·1, 95% UI 45·2-144), 
Armenia (85·1, 95% UI 45·8-143) and Tajikistan (85·1, 95% UI 46·1-143) ranked 
lowest.
CONCLUSIONS: The global prevalence rate of AD has remained stable from 1990 to 
2017. However, the distribution of AD by age groups shows a bimodal curve with 
the highest peak in early childhood, decreasing in prevalence among young 
adults, and a second peak in middle-aged and older populations. We also found a 
moderate positive correlation between a country's gross domestic product and 
disease burden. GBD data confirm the substantial worldwide burden of AD, which 
has remained stable since 1990 but shows significant geographical variation. 
Lifestyle factors, partially linked to affluence, are likely important disease 
drivers. However, the GBD methodology needs to be developed further to 
incorporate environmental risk factors, such as ultraviolet exposure, to 
understand better the geographical and age-related variations in disease burden.

The field of aging research has grown rapidly over the last half-century, with 
advancement of scientific technologies to interrogate mechanisms underlying the 
benefit of life-extending interventions like calorie restriction (CR). 
Coincident with this increase in knowledge has been the rise of obesity and type 
2 diabetes (T2D), both associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Given 
the difficulty in practicing long-term CR, a search for compounds (CR mimetics) 
which could recapitulate the health and longevity benefits without requiring 
food intake reductions was proposed. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are 
compounds that function predominantly within the gastrointestinal tract to 
inhibit α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymatic digestion of complex 
carbohydrates, delaying and decreasing monosaccharide uptake from the gut in the 
treatment of T2D. Acarbose, an AGI, has been shown in pre-clinical models to 
increase lifespan (greater longevity benefits in males), with decreased body 
weight gain independent of calorie intake reduction. The CR mimetic benefits of 
acarbose are further supported by clinical findings beyond T2D including the 
risk for other age-related diseases (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular). Open 
questions remain regarding the exclusivity of acarbose relative to other AGIs, 
potential off-target effects, and combination with other therapies for healthy 
aging and longevity extension. Given the promising results in pre-clinical 
models (even in the absence of T2D), a unique mechanism of action and multiple 
age-related reduced disease risks that have been reported with acarbose, support 
for clinical trials with acarbose focusing on aging-related outcomes and 
incorporating biological sex, age at treatment initiation, and T2D-dependence 
within the design is warranted.

The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the life 
expectancy of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
However, this population is at an increased risk for noncommunicable diseases, 
including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both ART and viral 
infection may be potential contributors to the pathophysiology of HIV-related 
CVD. The mechanisms behind this remain unclear, but it is critical to delineate 
early biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in the HIV population. In this review, 
we postulate that potential biomarkers could include alterations to high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL). Indeed, recent data suggest that HIV and ART may induce 
structural changes of HDL, thus resulting in shifts in HDL subclass distribution 
and HDL functionality.

Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir in hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in Germany: 
A reanalysis of published results.

Comment in
    PLoS One. 2021 Feb 18;16(2):e0245480.

OBJECTIVES: Recently, the results of two economic evaluations were published 
both of which seemingly demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based 
regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in 
Germany. Both analyses were sponsored by the manufacturer of sofosbuvir and use 
a different methodology: Whereas one evaluation is based on a conventional 
cost-utility analysis, the other rests upon the efficiency-frontier method used 
by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). The 
purpose of this study is to reanalysis the results of both economic evaluations 
in combination.
DESIGN: Reanalysis of published decision modelling results.
SETTING: Primary care in Germany.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection 
(treatment-naïve and -experienced, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic).
INTERVENTIONS: Sofosbuvir, other anti-hepatitis C virus drugs, and no treatment.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per unit of health benefit and cost 
per quality-adjusted life year.
RESULTS: Reanalysis of the results of both economic evaluations in combination 
reveals an unclear rationale for choosing the selected cost-effectiveness 
methods as well as a potential publication bias, favoring the product of the 
manufacturer. Based on the reanalysis, sofosbuvir is not cost-effective in 
treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic patients, potentially lacks 
cost-effectiveness in treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients, and is only 
partially cost-effective in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic patients. Taken 
together, these results indicate a lack of cost-effectiveness in three quarters 
of the German patient population.
CONCLUSIONS: Two economic evaluations on sofosbuvir suggest, in combination, 
that sofosbuvir cannot be considered a cost-effective treatment in three 
quarters of the German patient population.

BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders account for a large and increasing health 
burden worldwide, as shown in the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study 2016. 
Unpacking how this burden varies regionally and nationally is important to 
inform public health policy and prevention strategies. The population in the EU 
is older than that of the WHO European region (western, central, and eastern 
Europe) and even older than the global population, suggesting that it might be 
particularly vulnerable to an increasing burden of age-related neurological 
disorders. We aimed to compare the burden of neurological disorders in the EU 
between 1990 and 2017 with those of the WHO European region and worldwide.
METHODS: The burden of neurological disorders was calculated for the year 2017 
as incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), 
years of life lost, and years lived with disability for the countries in the EU 
and the WHO European region, totally and, separately. Diseases analysed were 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, epilepsy, headache (migraine and 
tension-type headache), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, brain cancer, 
motor neuron diseases, neuroinfectious diseases, and stroke. Data are presented 
as totals and by sex, age, year, location and socio-demographic context, and 
shown as counts and rates.
FINDINGS: In 2017, the total number of DALYs attributable to neurological 
disorders was 21·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 18·5-23·9) in the EU and 
41·1 million (36·7-45·9) in the WHO European region, and the total number of 
deaths was 1·1 million (1·09-1·14) in the EU and 1·97 million (1·95-2·01) in the 
WHO European region. In the EU, neurological disorders ranked third after 
cardiovascular diseases and cancers representing 13·3% (10·3-17·1) of total 
DALYs and 19·5% (18·0-21·3) of total deaths. Stroke, dementias, and headache 
were the three commonest causes of DALYs in the EU. Stroke was also the leading 
cause of DALYs in the WHO European region. During the study period we found a 
substantial increase in the all-age burden of neurodegenerative diseases, 
despite a substantial decrease in the rates of stroke and infections. The burden 
of neurological disorders in Europe was higher in men than in women, peaked in 
individuals aged 80-84 years, and varied substantially with WHO European region 
and country. All-age DALYs, deaths, and prevalence of neurological disorders 
increased in all-age measures, but decreased when using age-standardised 
measures in all but three countries (Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). 
The decrease was mostly attributed to the reduction of premature mortality 
despite an overall increase in the number of DALYs.
INTERPRETATION: Neurological disorders are the third most common cause of 
disability and premature death in the EU and their prevalence and burden will 
likely increase with the progressive ageing of the European population. Greater 
attention to neurological diseases must be paid by health authorities for 
prevention and care. The data presented here suggest different priorities for 
health service development and resource allocation in different countries.

BACKGROUND: Bilateral internal thoracic artery (BITA) grafting is questionable 
in octogenarians because of shorter life expectancy and increased risk of 
perioperative complications. The aim of this study was to examine the safety and 
effectiveness of performing BITA and single internal thoracic artery (SITA) 
grafts in patients older than 80 years of age.
METHODS: This study compared outcomes in 201 consecutive octogenarians who 
underwent isolated BITA grafting with those of 280 consecutive octogenarians who 
underwent SITA and saphenous vein grafting during 1996 to 2011. 
Insulin-dependent diabetes, ejection fraction <30, and emergency operations were 
more common among patients who underwent SITA, and the prevalence of left main 
coronary artery disease was lower. Propensity score matching was used to control 
for these differences, thus generating well-matched groups of 190 patients each.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in early mortality between the 
unmatched groups: 3.2% in the BITA group and 8.6% in the SITA group (P = .12). 
Rates of sternal wound infection were also similar, 1.5% vs 1.7%, respectively. 
Differences were not observed in the occurrences of perioperative stroke (3.5% 
vs 2.5%; P = .999) and myocardial infarction (1.5% vs 3.6%; P = .166). The 
results were similar for the matched groups. Long-term survival between the 
unmatched groups and survival between the matched groups were not significantly 
different.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows equal long-term survival for BITA and SITA 
grafting in octogenarians. BITA is an acceptable alternative to SITA grafting in 
low-risk octogenarians and in the presence of a calcified aorta or poor-quality 
saphenous vein graft.

Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. The 
development of distant metastases is associated with a poor prognosis. Ephrine 
receptors (Eph) are the largest subpopulation of tyrosine kinase receptors. They 
play an important role in processes related to the formation and progression of 
cancer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of ephrin receptors 
EphA1, EphA5, and EphA7 in uveal melanoma and its associations with 
clinicopathological parameters, overall survival, and disease-free survival. The 
study included 94 previously untreated patients who underwent enucleation due to 
uveal melanoma. High expression of EphA1 was positively correlated with a 
smaller tumor size, less frequent extra-scleral extension, lower mitotic 
activity, and more frequent vitreous hemorrhage. High expression of EphA5 was 
associated with less frequent chromosome 3 loss, absence of distant metastases, 
and more frequent vitreous hemorrhage. High expression of EphA7 was associated 
with a more frequent primary tumor location in the posterior pole. High EphA5 
expression was associated with longer overall survival time. The above findings 
indicate that high expression of EphA1 and EphA5 can be considered a beneficial 
prognostic factor in uveal melanoma.

Colors are important phenotypic traits for fitness under natural conditions in 
vertebrates. Previous studies have reported several functional genes and genetic 
variations of pigmentation, but the formation mechanisms of various skin 
coloration remained ambiguous in fish. Jinbian carp, a common carp variant, 
displays two colors (yellow and black) in the skin, thus, it is a good model for 
investigating the genetic basis of pigmentation. In the present study, using the 
Jinbian carp as model, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification 
(ITRAQ) proteomics analysis was performed for yellow and black skin, 
respectively. The results showed that 467 differentially expressed proteins 
(DEPs) were identified between the yellow skin and the black skin. Similar to 
mammals, the up-regulated DEPs in black skin included UV excision repair protein 
RAD23 homolog A (Rad23a), melanoregulin (mreg), 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic 
acid oxidase5 (tyrp1) and melanocyte protein PMEL (PMEL), which were mainly 
grouped into melanogenesis pathway. However, several up-regulated DEPs in yellow 
skin were mainly enriched in nucleotide metabolism, such as GTPase IMAP family 
member 5 (GIMAP5), AMP deaminase 1 (AMPD1), adenosylhomocysteinase b (ahcy-b), 
and pyruvate kinase (PKM). In summary, several candidate proteins and their 
enrichment pathways for color variation in Jinbian carp were identified, which 
may be responsible for the formation of different colorations.

BACKGROUND: To assess the safety and efficacy of long-term administration of 
guanfacine extended-release (GXR) in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD).
METHODS: In this open-label, long-term, phase 3 extension study in Japan, 150 
patients transitioned from a double-blind trial, and 41 newly enrolled patients 
received once daily GXR (starting dose 2 mg/day, maintenance dose 4-6 mg/day) 
for 50 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the frequency and nature of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); secondary outcome measures included 
the change from week 0 in ADHD Rating Scale IV with Adult Prompts (ADHD-RS-IV; 
Japanese version) total and subscale scores, Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales 
(CAARS), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) and Patient Global 
Impression-Improvement (PGI-I) scales, and quality of life (QoL) and executive 
functioning measures.
RESULTS: Of all patients, 94.2% (180/191) reported ≥1 TEAE and 19.9% (38/191) 
discontinued because of a TEAE. Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity; 
there were two serious TEAEs and no deaths. Commonly reported TEAEs (≥10% of 
patients) were somnolence, thirst, nasopharyngitis, decreased blood pressure, 
postural dizziness, bradycardia, malaise, constipation, and dizziness. Mean 
changes from week 0 in ADHD-RS-IV total and subscale scores and CAARS subscale 
scores were significantly improved in former placebo or GXR patients and new 
patients at last observation (p < .0001), and the percentage of patients with 
very much or much improved CGI-I and PGI-I scores increased.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no major safety concerns during long-term GXR 
administration in adults with ADHD. After long-term treatment, patients had 
significant improvements from baseline in ADHD symptoms, QoL, and executive 
functioning.

The earliest descriptions of botulism were in the early 19th century, and was 
reported by the German physician Justinus Kerner. The term "botulism" was 
derived from the Latin word botulus, indicating its original association with 
sausages. It took another 150 years or so to come into clinical use. The first 
clinical application was strabismus, and was developed by the American 
ophthalmologist Alan B. Scott, whose effort led to the pharmaceutical product 
known as onabotulinumtoxinA today. The therapeutic benefit in migraine was an 
incidental finding in a report by the American plastic surgeon William J. 
Binder, which inspired a series of clinical studies in headache disorders. The 
doses and injection techniques in the earlier reports were variable, so were the 
results. It was until the Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis 
Therapy (PREEMPT) 1 and 2 studies when its efficacy and safety, as well as the 
indication, i.e., chronic migraine (CM), were ascertained. Even though there 
were criticisms regarding the heterogeneities in the results between the PREEMPT 
1 and 2 studies, the data on efficacy endpoints and safety were generally 
consistent, which were subsequently confirmed by the open-label extension of the
