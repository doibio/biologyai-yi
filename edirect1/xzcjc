In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, called Exogenous Fitness, to 
calculate the Fitness of subnational entities and we apply it to the states of 
Brazil. In the last decade, several indices were introduced to measure the 
competitiveness of countries by looking at the complexity of their export 
basket. Tacchella et al (2012) developed a non-monetary metric called Fitness. 
In this paper, after an overview about Brazil as a whole and the comparison with 
the other BRIC countries, we introduce a new methodology based on the Fitness 
algorithm, called Exogenous Fitness. Combining the results with the Gross 
Domestic Product per capita (GDPp), we look at the dynamics of the Brazilian 
states in the Fitness-Income plane. Two regimes are distinguishable: one with 
high predictability and the other with low predictability, showing a deep 
analogy with the heterogeneous dynamics of the World countries. Furthermore, we 
compare the ranking of the Brazilian states according to the Exogenous Fitness 
with the ranking obtained through two other techniques, namely Endogenous 
Fitness and Economic Complexity Index.

BACKGROUND: There is an increasing need for cost computation of every aspect of 
human behavior for planning.
OBJECTIVE: This objective of the study was to compute the cost of suicide in 
India in 2015.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Official data on suicides and life expectancy in 2015 
formed the basis for computation of years of presumed life lost and total years 
of life lived (TYLL). Market rate and official estimates of various expenditures 
- pre- and post-suicide -formed the basis for loss and gain computation. The 
difference between income and expenditure formed the total cost.
RESULTS: A total of 133,623 persons committed suicide in 2015. They lost 
4,349,158 years in total while living for slightly more period of 4,777,293 
years. Postsuicide, the expenses were 152,233.8 trillion with a saving of 29,200 
trillion. During the lifetime they lived, these people generated an income of 
1,672,198 trillion and cost 320739.3 trillion. The net cost of suicide was ' 
149,313.9 trillion.
CONCLUSIONS: Although suicide cannot be prevented completely, much monetary loss 
can be minimized with adequate preventive tailor-made strategies.

reinhardtii.

Bilins are linear tetrapyrroles commonly used as chromophores of 
phycobiliproteins and phytochromes for light-harvesting or light-sensing in 
photosynthetic organisms. Many eukaryotic algae lack both phycobiliproteins and 
phytochromes, but retain the bilin biosynthetic enzymes including heme oxygenase 
(HO/HMOX) and ferredoxin-dependent biliverdin reductase (FDBR). Previous studies 
on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii heme oxygenase mutant (hmox1) have shown that 
bilins are not only essential retrograde signals to mitigate oxidative stress 
during diurnal dark-to-light transitions, they are also required for chlorophyll 
accumulation and maintenance of a functional photosynthetic apparatus in the 
light. However, the underlying mechanism of bilin-mediated regulation of 
chlorophyll biosynthesis is unclear. In this study, Chlamydomonas 
phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase PCYA1 FDBR domain was found to 
specifically interact with the rate-limiting chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme 
LPOR (light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase). PCYA1 is partially 
associated with chloroplast envelope membrane, consistent with the observed 
export of bilin from chloroplast to cytosol by cytosolic expression of a 
bilin-binding reporter protein in Chlamydomonas. Both the pcya1-1 mutant with 
the carboxyl-terminal extension of PCYA1 eliminated and efficient knockdown of 
PCYA1 expression by artificial microRNA exhibited no significant impact on algal 
phototrophic growth and photosynthetic proteins accumulation, indicating that 
the conserved FDBR domain is sufficient and minimally required for bilin 
biosynthesis and functioning. Taken together, these studies provide novel 
insights into the regulatory role of PCYA1 in chlorophyll biosynthesis via 
interaction with key Chl biosynthetic enzyme.

Mohamed Ben Abdallah, Fès, Maroc.

We report the case of a newborn male admitted on the first day of his life with 
temporo-occipital swelling detected at birth. Clinical examination showed 
conscious, hemodynamically and respiratory stable, afebrile, vigorous and 
responsive newborn; craniofacial examination objectified soft, mobile, 
temporo-occipital mass covered by the scalp measuring 10 cm along its longer 
left paramedian axis (A). Craniocerebral CT scan showed large heterogeneous left 
subgaleal parietal-temporal-occipital mass measuring 40/80 mm, suggesting a 
tumor of soft tissue components of the scalp (B). The newborn underwent surgery 
which revealed bilobed tumor of the left temporo occipital soft tissue 
components, without extension to the cranial or the endocranial vault (C). 
Complete resection of the two masses was performed (D). Anatomo-pathologic study 
showed histological and immunohistochemical features of embryonal 
rhabdomyosarcoma. Staging evaluation was unremarkable. No chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy was proposed to the patient. At 1-year follow-up the child was 
asymptomatic and ultrasound examination of the surgical site was unremarkable.

In this study, we analyzed healthcare provision and health expenditure across 
six Mediterranean countries that adopt the National Health System (Beveridge 
model) and that form part of the European Union (EU) with the main aim being 
that of analyzing and comparing out-of-pocket health spending in countries with 
a European Mediterranean connection. To this end, we considered various economic 
indicators and statistics to derive commonalities and differences across these 
countries and also compared trends in these indicators to those observed across 
the rest of the EU. We then analyzed these findings in light of other data 
related to the quality of healthcare delivery and the infrastructure of the 
health system and discussed recent developments in healthcare within each 
country and the main challenges faced by the respective health systems. The 
results show that on average, Mediterranean countries spend less on total 
healthcare expenditure (THE) than the EU average, both as a proportion of GDP, 
as well as in per capita terms. This is primarily driven by 
lower-than-EU-average public funding of healthcare. The 2008/2009 macro-economic 
and financial crisis had a significant impact on the countries under review, and 
explains the persistent reductions in public health spending as part of the 
austerity measures put in force across sectors. On the flipside, Mediterranean 
countries have a higher presence of private health providers in total funding, 
thereby explaining the higher Out-of-Pocket (OOPs) health expenditures in these 
countries relative to the EU-average. With regard to the overall health 
infrastructure in these countries, we observed that although the supply of 
physicians is largely in line with the rest of the EU, there is under-supply 
when it comes to hospital beds. This may be symptomatic of lower government 
funding. Nonetheless, all countries score highly in the evaluation of the 
quality of health services, as recorded by international rankings like the WHO's 
2000 metric, whereas health system performance indicators, namely mortality 
rates and life expectancy reveal favorable health outcomes in the Mediterranean 
EU countries. The findings in this paper may be seen in light of the 
Mediterranean region's lifestyle in terms of diet, health behavior, health 
beliefs and shared culture. In particular, the higher out-of-pocket expenditure 
may reflect the tendency for one-to-one relationships with private clinicians 
and the pursuit of person-centered care (1). Additionally, the Mediterranean 
people may not be as disciplined as their European counterparts in accessing and 
using the public health sector. The lower THE also reflects the fact that the 
Mediterranean countries are less wealthy than the more economically-advanced 
European countries.

As one of the most active components in soil, bacteria can affect soil 
physicochemical properties, its biological characteristics, and even its quality 
and health. We characterized dynamics of the soil bacterial diversity in planted 
(with Taxodium distichum) and unplanted soil in the riparian zone of the Three 
Gorges Dam Reservoir (TGDR), in southwestern China, in order to accurately 
quantify the changes in long-term soil bacterial community structure after 
revegetation. Measurements were taken annually in situ in the TGDR over the 
course of 5 years, from 2012 to 2016. Soil chemical properties and bacterial 
diversity were analyzed in both the planted and unplanted soil. After 
revegetation, the soil chemical properties in planted soil were significantly 
different than in unplanted soil. The effects of treatment, time, and the 
interaction of both time and treatment had significant impacts on most diversity 
indices. Specifically, the bacterial community diversity indices in planted soil 
were significantly higher and more stable than that in unplanted soil. The 
correlation analyses indicated that the diversity indices correlated with the pH 
value, organic matter, and soil available nutrients. After revegetation in the 
riparian zone of the TGDR, the soil quality and health is closely related to the 
observed bacterial diversity, and a higher bacterial diversity avails the 
maintenance of soil functionality. Thus, more reforestation should be carried 
out in the riparian zone of the TGDR, so as to effectively mitigate the negative 
ecological impacts of the dam. Vegetating the reservoir banks with Taxodium 
distichum proved successful, but planting mixed stands of native tree species 
could promote even higher riparian soil biodiversity and improved levels of 
ecosystem functioning within the TGDR.

, Australia.

CONTEXT: Fiji has undergone an epidemiological transition, characterised by 
declining infectious disease and childhood mortality, that has been offset by 
rising cardiovascular disease mortality. Other Pacific Island states are in a 
comparable situation.
OBJECTIVE: With a focus on Fiji, this study reviews and contextualises research 
performed by the authors and others that examines cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and their risk factors in Pacific Island states.
METHODS: This overview covers evidence for the causes and consequences of CVD 
risk factors and the epidemiological transition and reflects on biological and 
evolutionary hypotheses. It is based on studies the authors carried out that 
synthesised disparate population-based CVD risk factor surveys conducted in Fiji 
over 1980-2012.
RESULTS: Prevalences of obesity, T2DM and hypertension continue to increase in 
the Fiji population. Tobacco smoking prevalence has decreased, but remains 
relatively high in men compared to many developed countries. T2DM and 
hypertension trends, and CVD consequences related to diet, exercise and tobacco 
smoking, have placed the Fiji population in a variant of the epidemiological 
transition manifesting as a plateau in life expectancy similar to that of 
numerous developed countries during the mid-20th century.
CONCLUSION: There is evidence that risk factors and consequent CVD mortality can 
be reduced in populations. Obesity and T2DM reductions have been observed only 
in populations surviving in dire circumstances. Interventions to lower the 
prevalence of CVD and T2DM risk factors in the Fiji population require 
multi-faceted approaches, with continual monitoring and evaluation for their 
impact on these risk factors and morbidity and mortality outcomes.

How Significant Are "High" Correlations Between EQ-5D Value Sets?

The calculation of quality-adjusted life years, as used for cost-utility 
analysis, depends on the availability of value sets representing people's 
preferences with respect to health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A value set 
consists of HRQoL index values for all health states representable by the 
particular descriptive system used, of which the EQ-5D (EuroQoL, 5 Dimensions) 
is by far the most widely used. High correlation coefficients for EQ-5D value 
sets derived from different samples-across countries and/or using different 
valuation techniques-are conventionally interpreted as evidence that the people 
in the respective samples have similar HRQoL preferences. However, EQ-5D value 
sets-for both versions of the system (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L)-contain many 
inherent rankings of health state values by design. By calculating correlation 
coefficients for value sets created from random data, we demonstrate that "high" 
coefficients are artifacts of these inherent rankings, such as median Pearson's 
r = 0.783 for the EQ-5D-3L and 0.850 for the EQ-5D-5L instead of zero. 
Therefore, high correlation coefficients do not necessarily constitute evidence 
of meaningful associations in terms of similar HRQoL preferences. After 
calculating significance levels based on our simulations-available as an online 
resource for other researchers-we find that many high coefficients are not as 
significant as conventionally interpreted, whereas other coefficients are not 
significant. These "high" but insignificant correlations are in fact spurious.

BACKGROUND: Arm pain is common, costly to health services and society. 
Physiotherapy referral is standard management, and while awaiting treatment, 
advice is often given to rest, but the evidence base is weak.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of advice to remain active (AA) 
versus advice to rest (AR); and immediate physiotherapy (IP) versus usual care 
(waiting list) physiotherapy (UCP).
METHODS: Twenty-six-week within-trial economic evaluation (538 participants aged 
≥18 years randomized to usual care, i.e. AA (n = 178), AR (n = 182) or IP (n = 
178). Regression analysis estimated differences in mean costs and 
Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated. Primary 
analysis comprised the 193 patients with complete resource use (UK NHS 
perspective) and EQ-5D data. Sensitivity analysis investigated uncertainty.
RESULTS: Baseline-adjusted cost differences were £88 [95% confidence interval 
(CI): -14, 201) AA versus AR; -£14 (95% CI: -87, 66) IP versus UCP. 
Baseline-adjusted QALY differences were 0.0095 (95% CI: -0.0140, 0.0344) AA 
versus AR; 0.0143 (95% CI: -0.0077, 0.0354) IP versus UCP. There was a 71 and 
89% probability that AA (versus AR) and IP (versus UCP) were the most 
cost-effective option using a threshold of £20,000 per additional QALY.  The 
results were robust in the sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: The difference in mean costs and mean QALYs between the competing 
strategies was small and not statistically significant. However, decision-makers 
may judge that IP was not shown to be any more effective than delayed treatment, 
and was no more costly than delayed physiotherapy. AA is preferable to one that 
encourages AR, as it is more effective and more likely to be cost-effective than 
AR.

A Life Table for Liriomyza trifolii (Diptera: Agromyzidae) in a Temperate Zone 
of Northeast Egypt With Key Factor Analysis.

The American serpentine leaf miner, Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) (Diptera: 
Agromyzidae), is a perennial pest of leguminous crops in the Mediterranean 
region. A life table was constructed for L. trifolii infesting broad bean, Vicia 
faba L., in northern Egypt. Key factor analysis was used to rank sources of 
immature mortality over two seasons. Leaf miners had three successive 
generations, and a partial fourth, in each year, with peak abundance in 
March-April. Less than 15 and 22% of L. trifolii survived to adult in seasons 
one and two, respectively. The largest contributor of immature leaf miner 
mortality in both seasons was unknown (41.2 and 39.1% of total mortality, 
respectively), and likely comprised a combination of abiotic factors, 
parasitoid-inflicted mortality (host-feeding), and predation. Parasitism was 
second, contributing 36.2 and 35.6% of total mortality in the two seasons, 
respectively, primarily due to larval parasitism by Diglyphus isaea (Walker) 
(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), and low levels of larval-pupal parasitism by Opius 
pallipes Wesmael (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Halticoptera circulus (Walker) 
(Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). Residual mortality resulted from malformed pupae or 
failed adult emergence. Key factor analysis revealed malformation to be the 
major cause of pupal mortality. Sequential regression confirmed that unknown 
mortality and D. isaea were the top stage-specific factors, both acting on 
larvae. Parasitoid abundance tracked host abundance across generations, but 
density dependence was not observed for any mortality factor, and the magnitudes 
of regression slopes were small. The results indicate the potential importance 
of conservation biological control in management of L. trifolii, given that 
naturally occurring parasitoids and other biotic/abiotic factors exert 
significant mortality on immature leaf miners.

Aging in Moldova: A Country With Orphan Older Adults.

Cojocari T(1), Cupcea R(1).

The Republic of Moldova is now facing one of the most difficult periods in the 
26 years of its independence as a democratic country. The crisis in the 
financial system that started in 2014 has gradually spread to all other areas of 
the state, and with a lack of solutions proposed by the government to improve 
quality of life, there is apathy and indifference among the country's population 
regarding internal sociopolitical problems. These issues have directly impacted 
the country's demography, leading to significant changes in the population. In 
2014, the proportion of people aged 60 and older was 17.4%, almost equal to the 
proportion of young people aged 0-14 years, which was 18.2%; these numbers 
suggest that the future does not look good for the work force. Older adults from 
Moldova are the poorest age group in the EU, and their life expectancy is 
comparable to that in the EU at the beginning of the 1990s. The deficit in the 
social security budget has directly affected pensioners' well-being. Topics such 
as active ageing, stigmatization, abuse and violence against old people, and 
older adults' quality of life are absent from the political agenda, while the 
issue of Moldovan migrants and their pension rights has yet to be addressed by 
legislation. The phenomenon of "ghost villages" is spreading. Soon, Moldova 
faces the risk of becoming a ghost country of orphan older adults, left behind 
without support of younger family members who have migrated elsewhere for a 
better life.

AIM: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of afatinib and erlotinib as 
second-line therapy for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed for projecting the 
economic outcomes. Clinical parameters and utilities were from the LUX-Lung 8 
trial. Costs were mainly estimated from the Chinese health system. The outcome 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: The afatinib strategy generated additional 0.154 quality-adjusted 
life-years compared with erlotinib, with incremental costs of ¥16,852. Relative 
to erlotinib, afatinib resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
¥109,429 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The overall survival time of 
afatinib had a considerable impact on the model outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Afatinib is a cost-effective treatment option compared with 
erlotinib in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.

Neurons develop elaborate morphologies that provide a model for understanding 
cellular architecture. By studying C. elegans sensory dendrites, we previously 
identified genes that act to promote the extension of ciliated sensory dendrites 
during embryogenesis. Interestingly, the nonciliated dendrite of the 
oxygen-sensing neuron URX is not affected by these genes, suggesting it develops 
through a distinct mechanism. Here, we use a visual forward genetic screen to 
identify mutants that affect URX dendrite morphogenesis. We find that disruption 
of the MAP kinase MAPK-15 or the βH-spectrin SMA-1 causes a phenotype opposite 
to what we had seen before: dendrites extend normally during embryogenesis but 
begin to overgrow as the animals reach adulthood, ultimately extending up to 
150% of their normal length. SMA-1 is broadly expressed and acts 
non-cell-autonomously, while MAPK-15 is expressed in many sensory neurons 
including URX and acts cell-autonomously. MAPK-15 acts at the time of 
overgrowth, localizes at the dendrite ending, and requires its kinase activity, 
suggesting it acts locally in time and space to constrain dendrite growth. 
Finally, we find that the oxygen-sensing guanylate cyclase GCY-35, which 
normally localizes at the dendrite ending, is localized throughout the overgrown 
region, and that overgrowth can be suppressed by overexpressing GCY-35 or by 
genetically mimicking elevated cGMP signaling. These results suggest that 
overgrowth may correspond to expansion of a sensory compartment at the dendrite 
ending, reminiscent of the remodeling of sensory cilia or dendritic spines. 
Thus, in contrast to established pathways that promote dendrite growth during 
early development, our results reveal a distinct mechanism that constrains 
dendrite growth throughout the life of the animal, possibly by controlling the 
size of a sensory compartment at the dendrite ending.

Patients with schizophrenia have higher mortality and shortened life expectancy 
than the general population, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for up to 
50% cases of early mortality in schizophrenia. We determined risk factors, 
particularly pathophysiological changes, for early circulatory mortality in 
schizophrenia. In this multi-institutional, nested, case-control study, we 
enrolled consecutive inpatients with schizophrenia admitted to three psychiatric 
hospitals in the northern Taiwan. Seventy-nine patients who died of CVD before 
65 years of age were identified as cases through record linkage, and 158 
controls were randomly selected in a 2:1 ratio through risk-set density 
sampling, after matching for age (±2 years), sex, and index admission 
(±3 years). Data were obtained through medical record reviews. At the time of 
death, the mean age of the patients was 47.5 years (standard deviation = 10.3). 
Conditional logistic regression revealed that the duration of antipsychotic 
treatment was significantly associated with a lower risk of early circulatory 
mortality, and leukocyte counts at index hospitalization were significantly 
associated with a higher risk. Systemic inflammation may be a risk factor for 
early circulatory mortality in schizophrenia, but antipsychotic treatment, in 
particular typical antipsychotic treatment, could be a protective factor.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cost effectiveness of cascade testing for familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is well recognised. Less clear is the cost 
effectiveness of FH screening when it includes case identification strategies 
that incorporate routinely available data from primary and secondary care 
electronic health records.
METHODS: Nine strategies were compared, all using cascade testing in combination 
with different index case approaches (primary care identification, secondary 
care identification, and clinical assessment using the Simon Broome (SB) or 
Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria). A decision analytic model was 
informed by three systematic literature reviews and expert advice provided by a 
NICE Guideline Committee.
RESULTS: The model found that the addition of primary care case identification 
by database search for patients with recorded total cholesterol >9.3 mmol/L was 
more cost effective than cascade testing alone. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of clinical assessment using the DLCN criteria 
was £3254 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with case-finding with 
no genetic testing. The ICER of clinical assessment using the SB criteria was 
£13,365 per QALY (compared with primary care identification using the DLCN 
criteria), indicating that the SB criteria was preferred because it achieved 
additional health benefits at an acceptable cost. Secondary care identification, 
with either the SB or DLCN criteria, was not cost effective, alone (dominated 
and dominated respectively) or combined with primary care identification (£63, 
514 per QALY, and £82,388 per QALY respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Searching primary care databases for people at high risk of FH 
followed by cascade testing is likely to be cost-effective.

INTRODUCTION: In developing a model of palliative care, the attitudes, needs, 
and requirements of its beneficiaries recognizing the limited remaining life 
expectancy need to be met. We aimed to map and compare these issues at the end 
of life in the groups of patients with advanced cancer and elderly individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prospective study based on the analysis of 
semistructured interviews was conducted. Fifty individuals aged older than 85 
and 50 incurable patients with advanced cancer were studied. Transcripts of 
interviews were analyzed qualitatively (the interviews were divided into 
logically completed themes, and the compliance of each with one of the levels of 
Abraham Maslow pyramid was determined) and quantitatively (data comparisons of 2 
groups were tested in bivariate analysis using Pearson χ2 or Fisher exact test. 
Two-sided significance tests were used; P value of <.05 was deemed significant).
RESULTS: It was assumed that 120 themes were relevant to a certain level of 
Maslow pyramid. Their comparison showed small differences in the narratives of 
the patients with advanced cancer and elderly individuals aged 85 and 
older-concerning the past, present, and future terms of lives. In studied themes 
explicitly prevail the stories that are consistent with satisfaction of the 
upper levels of the hierarchy of needs and demands of Maslow: social relation 
(belonging), love, esteem, and transcendence.
CONCLUSION: The attitudes, needs, and requirements at the end of life of the 
people are basically similar, regardless of what determined the sense of 
limitation of the remaining life-incurable disease or advanced age.

Matrix methods in health demography: a new approach to the stochastic analysis 
of healthy longevity and DALYs.

(InCent), University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, Odense, DK-5230, 
Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Increases in human longevity have made it critical to distinguish 
healthy longevity from longevity without regard to health. Current methods focus 
on expectations of healthy longevity, and are often limited to binary health 
outcomes (e.g., disabled vs. not disabled). We present a new matrix formulation 
for the statistics of healthy longevity, based on health prevalence data and 
Markov chain theory, applicable to any kind of health outcome and which provides 
variances and higher moments as well as expectations of healthy life.
METHOD: The model is based on a Markov chain description of the life course 
coupled with the moments of health outcomes ("rewards") at each age or stage. As 
an example, we apply the method to nine European countries using the SHARE 
survey data on the binary outcome of disability as measured by activities of 
daily living, and the continuous health outcome of hand grip strength.
RESULTS: We provide analytical formulas for the mean, variance, coefficient of 
variation, skewness and other statistical properties of healthy longevity. The 
analysis is applicable to binary, categorical, ordinal, or interval scale health 
outcomes. The results are easily evaluated in any matrix-oriented software. The 
SHARE results reveal familiar patterns for the expectation of life and of 
healthy life: women live longer than men but spend less time in a healthy 
condition. New results on the variance shows that the standard deviation of 
remaining healthy life declines with age, but the coefficient of variation is 
nearly constant. Remaining grip strength years decrease with age more 
dramatically than healthy years but their variability pattern is similar to the 
pattern of healthy years. Patterns are similar across nine European countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The method extends, in several directions, current calculations of 
health expectancy (HE) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). It applies to 
both categorical and continuous health outcomes, to combinations of multiple 
outcomes (e.g., death and disability in the formulation of DALYs) and to age- or 
stage-classified models. It reveals previously unreported patterns of variation 
among individuals in the outcomes of healthy longevity.

BACKGROUND: Sexual health positively correlates with overall wellbeing. Existing 
therapeutics to enhance male sexual health are limited by factors that include 
responsiveness, adherence and adverse effects. As the population ages, safe and 
effective interventions that preserve male sexual function are needed. Published 
research suggests that various preparations of Kaempferia parviflora, a plant in 
the Zingiberaceae (ginger) family, support cardiovascular health and may 
ameliorate erectile function.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of KaempMax™, an 
ethanol extract of the K. parviflora rhizome, on erectile function in healthy 
middle-aged and older men.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We conducted an open-label, 
one-arm study on 14 generally healthy males aged 50-68 years with self-reported 
mild erectile dysfunction, who were not using prescription treatments. 
Participants took 100 mg KaempMax™ daily for 30 days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluations were conducted at baseline and on the final 
study assessment. Primary efficacy analyses included the International Index of 
Erectile Function (IIEF); secondary efficacy analyses included the Global 
Assessment Question about erectile function.
RESULTS: Thirteen participants completed the 30-day study. Supplementation with 
KaempMax™ resulted in statistically significant improvements in erectile 
function, intercourse satisfaction and total scores on the IIEF questionnaire. 
KaempMax™ was well tolerated and exhibited an excellent safety profile.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KaempMax™ may improve erectile function in 
healthy middle-aged and older men. While the effects were not as pronounced as 
what might be seen with prescription medication, most participants found them 
satisfactory. Additional, longer and placebo-controlled clinical trials will be 
needed.

Multiple myeloma is a disease typical of the elderly, and, because of the 
increase in life expectancy of the general population, its incidence is expected 
to grow in the future. Elderly patients represent a particular challenge due to 
their marked heterogeneity. Many new and highly effective drugs have been 
introduced in the last few years and results from clinical trials are promising. 
Besides the availability of novel agents, a careful evaluation of elderly 
patients showed to be a key factor for the success of therapy. A geriatric 
assessment is a valid strategy to better stratify patients. In particular, 
different scores are available today to appropriately assess elderly patients 
and define their fitness/frailty status. The choice of 
treatment-transplantation, triplets, doublets, or reduced-dose therapies 
including novel agents-should depend on the patient's fitness status (fit, 
intermediate-fit or frail). Second-generation novel agents have also been 
evaluated as salvage therapy in the elderly, and these new agents certainly 
represent a further step forward in the treatment armamentarium for elderly 
patients with multiple myeloma.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy lengthening and aging of population resulted in 
dramatically increase of patients with osteoarthritis. Total knee arthroplasty 
is widely used as the gold standard in order to relieve pain, correct deformity 
and restore function. A contemporary and controversial topic, is that of 
minimally invasive surgery for TKA. The minimally invasive approaches are based 
on the concept that they don't violate the extensor mechanism, resulting in 
earlier functional recovery, shorter hospital stay and enhanced patients' 
overall satisfaction. The most commonly used MIS approaches in TKA are the 
subvastus, midvastus and the quadriceps sparing. There is a debate regarding the 
efficacy and safety of these methods.
OBJECTIVE: In this article we will review the current literature (randomized 
controlled trials and systematic reviews/meta-analyses) on MIS compared to 
traditional approach and analyse their clinical safety, efficacy and long-term 
results.
DESIGN: Comparison of well-designed studies have tried to demonstrate the 
advantages/disadvantages, the clinical results and the complications of the MIS 
approaches compared to the MPP approach.
RESULTS: MIS approaches seem to provide advantages in the immediate 
post-operative period accompanied by increased reports of complications. 
Consequently, further investigation based on large well-designed studies with 
long-term results are warranted to further clarify MIS effectiveness/safety.

Comparative studies of the serum half-life extension of a protein via 
site-specific conjugation to a species-matched or -mismatched albumin.

Human serum albumin (HSA) has been investigated as a serum half-life extender of 
therapeutic proteins thanks to its unusually long serum half-life. However, in 
mice, the serum half-life of a HSA-conjugated protein was much shorter than that 
of HSA in humans, likely due to the species-dependent nature of albumin-FcRn 
interactions. Herein, we investigated species-dependent albumin-FcRn 
interactions using species-matched albumin (mouse serum albumin) and 
species-mismatched albumin (HSA) in non-transgenic mice. We site-specifically 
introduced a clickable non-natural amino acid to a target protein followed by 
conjugation to an albumin species via a hetero-bifunctional linker. Using in 
vitro binding assays, we showed that both HSA- and MSA-conjugated proteins bound 
mouse FcRns. Conjugation of HSA led to very limited extension of the serum 
half-life of sfGFP in mice (16.3 h), compared to that of HSA in transgenic mice 
harboring an allele of mouse FcRn knock-out and expressing humn FcRn (67 h) 
reported previously. These results suggest that the FcRn-mediated recycling of 
HSA is not effective in mice. However, conjugation of mouse serum albumin (MSA) 
resulted in a serum half-life of sfGFP (27.7 h) comparable to that of MSA in 
mice (28.8 h). Altogether, our study supported that albumin-FcRn interactions 
are species dependent in vivo.
