Erratum in
    Lancet Haematol. 2019 Mar;6(3):e121.

BACKGROUND: We previously showed that human anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATLG) 
plus ciclosporin and methotrexate given to patients with acute leukaemia in 
remission, having allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation with 
peripheral blood stem cells from an HLA-identical sibling donor after 
myeloablative conditioning, significantly reduced 2-year chronic 
graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) incidence and severity, without increasing 
disease relapse and infections, and improves cGVHD-free and relapse-free 
survival (cGRFS). The aim of an extended follow-up study was the assessment of 
long-term outcomes, which are, in this context, scarcely reported in the 
literature. We report unpublished data on quality of life (QoL) from the 
original study and the results of a follow-up extension.
METHODS: In the original open-label study, patients with acute myeloid and 
lymphoblastic leukaemia in first or subsequent remission, having sibling 
HLA-identical allogeneic peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation, were 
randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ATLG plus standard GVHD prophylaxis with 
ciclosporin and short-term methotrexate (ATLG group) or standard GVHD 
prophylaxis without ATLG (non-ATLG group). Conditioning regimens were 
cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg with either total body irradiation (12 Gy) or 
busulfan (12·8 mg/kg intravenously or 16 mg/kg orally), with or without 
etoposide (30-60 mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified according to centre and 
disease risk. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of cGVHD at 2 years. 
The primary and secondary endpoints, excluding QoL, have been published. QoL, 
assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HDC29 questionnaires, was an unpublished secondary endpoint, 
which we now report here. A follow-up extension was then done, with the primary 
endpoint cumulative incidence of cGVHD. Enrolment has been completed for both 
studies. The original trial (number, NCT00678275) and follow-up extension 
(number, NCT03042676) are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.
FINDINGS: In the original study, from Dec 14, 2006, to Feb 2, 2012, 161 patients 
were enrolled and 155 were randomly assigned to either the ATLG group (n=83) or 
to the non-ATLG group (n=72). In the follow-up study, which started on Feb 7, 
2017, and was completed on June 30, 2017, 61 patients were included in the ATLG 
group and 53 were included in the non-ATLG group. Global health status showed a 
more favourable time course in the ATLG group compared with the non-ATLG group 
(p=0·02; treatment by visit interaction). ATLG was descriptively superior to 
non-ATLG at 24 months for physical function (points estimate -14·8 [95% CI -26·4 
to -3·1]; p=0·014) and social function (-19·1 [-38·0 to -0·2]; p=0·047), 
gastrointestinal side-effects (8·8 [2·5-15·1]; p=0·008) and effect on family 
(13·5 [1·2-25·8]; p=0·032). Extended follow-up (median 5·9 years [IQR 1·7-7·9]) 
confirmed a lower 5-year cGVHD incidence (30·0% [95% CI 21·4-41·9] vs 69·1% 
[59·1-80·1]; analysis for entire follow-up, p<0·001), no increase in relapses 
(35·4% [26·4-47·5] vs 22·5% [14·6-34·7]; p=0·09), improved cGRFS (34·3% 
[24·2-44·5] vs 13·9% [7·1-22·9]; p=0·005), and fewer patients still in 
immunosuppression (9·6% vs 28·3%; p=0·017) in the ATLG group compared with the 
non-ATLG group. 5-year overall survival, relapse-free survival, and non-relapse 
mortality did not differ significantly between groups.
INTERPRETATION: The addition of ATLG to standard GVHD prophylaxis improves the 
probability of surviving without disease relapse and cGVHD after myeloablative 
peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor 
for patients with acute leukaemia in remission. Further additional benefits are 
better QoL and shorter immunosuppressive treatment compared with standard GVHD 
prophylaxis without ATLG. Therefore, in this setting, ATLG plus standard GVHD 
prophylaxis should be preferred over the standard GVHD prophylaxis alone.

Hong Kong is a compact territory in Southern China that enjoys a high degree of 
autonomy. Despite its dense population and uneven wealth distribution, infant 
mortality is low and life expectancy is long. The health service is more 
hospital and clinic based than community based. This seems cost-effective while 
professional standards are high and rigorously maintained. Drug registration 
follows American and European requirements. Hong Kong is a part of the 
Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme, which brings a high standard of 
drug regulation. Hong Kong is a good choice for clinical trials because the 
subjects are Chinese and protocols in English do not need to be translated. 
There are also 2 well-established clinical trials centers in university 
hospitals that also run Phase I and clinical pharmacology studies.

Academic administration can be an extension of an academic career at the bench 
or it can run parallel to a career of discovery. To be an academic administrator 
at the executive level in a college or university generally requires advancement 
through the academic ranks to the professorial level. These positions include 
department chair, dean of a college, head of a center or institute, provost, 
senior research officer, and university or college president. Positions that can 
begin immediately after attaining a PhD or after a postdoctoral position include 
some assistant dean roles and positions in technology transfer, grants 
management, and laboratory management, among many others. Many of the skills 
developed during the pursuit of an advanced degree in the life sciences are 
directly applicable to these jobs. All require problem solving, critical 
thinking, collaboration, and the ability to communicate clearly.

PURPOSE: Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA) is recommended to prevent 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients who receive highly 
or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC or MEC, respectively). We previously 
reported that aprepitant, an NK1RA, was needed to control CINV in 43% and 12% of 
patients who received HEC and MEC, respectively (Support Care Cancer 23:905-912, 
2015). To elucidate the cost-effectiveness of aprepitant in these patients, a 
cost-utility analysis according to the necessity of aprepitant was performed.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed according to the necessity of 
aprepitant and CINV responses in both acute and delayed phases of chemotherapy. 
Probabilities of health states and medical costs were derived from the results 
of the abovementioned trial.
RESULT: In patients who received HEC and needed aprepitant, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with aprepitant, relative to the regimen with no 
aprepitant, was 7912 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained, which was far below the commonly accepted threshold of 50,000 USD/QALY. 
The ICER was 27,457 USD/QALY in patients who received MEC and needed aprepitant. 
In contrast, in patients who received HEC or MEC but did not need aprepitant, 
the ICER was 175,959 or 478,844 USD/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Regardless of whether a patient received HEC or MEC, aprepitant use 
was highly cost-effective for patients who truly needed it. These results 
warrant further research to predict the necessity of NK1RA treatment before 
initiating emetogenic chemotherapies.

BACKGROUND: The Weight-Specific Adolescent Instrument for Economic Evaluation 
(WAItE) is a new condition-specific patient reported outcome measure that 
incorporates the views of adolescents in assessing the impact of above healthy 
weight status on key aspects of their lives. Presently it is not possible to use 
the WAItE to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for cost-utility 
analysis (CUA), given that utility scores are not available for health states 
described by the WAItE.
OBJECTIVE: This paper examines different regression models for estimating Child 
Health Utility 9 Dimension (CHU-9D) utility scores from the WAItE for the 
purpose of calculating QALYs to inform CUA.
METHODS: The WAItE and CHU-9D were completed by a sample of 975 adolescents. 
Nine regression models were estimated: ordinary least squares, Tobit, censored 
least absolute deviations, two-part, generalized linear model, robust 
MM-estimator, beta-binomial, finite mixture models, and ordered logistic 
regression. The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) were used 
to assess the predictive ability of the models.
RESULTS: The robust MM-estimator with stepwise-selected WAItE item scores as 
explanatory variables had the best predictive accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Condition-specific tools have been shown to be more sensitive to 
changes that are important to the population for which they have been developed 
for. The mapping algorithm developed in this study facilitates the estimation of 
health-state utilities necessary for undertaking CUA within clinical studies 
that have only collected the WAItE.

BACKGROUND: There is an implicit equity approach in cost-effectiveness analysis 
that values health gains of socioeconomic position groups equally. An 
alternative approach is to integrate equity by weighting quality-adjusted 
life-years according to the socioeconomic position group.
OBJECTIVES: To use two approaches to derive equity weights for use in 
cost-effectiveness analysis in Australia, in contexts in which the use of the 
traditional nonweighted quality-adjusted life-years could increase health 
inequalities between already disadvantaged groups.
METHODS: Equity weights derived using epidemiological data used burden of 
disease and mortality data by Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas quintiles from 
the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Two ratios were calculated 
comparing quintile 1 (lowest) to the total Australian population, and comparing 
quintile 1 to quintile 5 (highest). Preference-based weights were derived using 
a discrete choice experiment survey (n = 710). Respondents chose between two 
programs, with varying gains in life expectancy going to a low- or a high-income 
group. A probit model incorporating nominal values of the difference in life 
expectancy was estimated to calculate the equity weights.
RESULTS: The epidemiological weights ranged from 1.2 to 1.5, with larger weights 
when quintile 5 was the denominator. The preference-based weights ranged from 
1.3 (95% confidence interval 1.2-1.4) to 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.6-2.0), 
with a tendency for increasing weights as the gains to the low-income group 
increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Both methods derived plausible and consistent weights. Using 
weights of different magnitudes in sensitivity analysis would allow the 
appropriate weight to be considered by decision makers and stakeholders to 
reflect policy objectives.

The mortality and morbidity burden estimation of diarrheal diseases (DD), and 
Shigella and Enterotoxigenic E. Coli (ETEC) varies among different studies and 
by the models used for producing these estimates. Understanding the real burden 
of these important pathogens will guide public health and policy makers to 
prioritize resources for accelerating interventions against these enteric 
infections. In addition, long term effects, in the form of growth faltering, 
cognitive impairment and decreased school performance are important aspects of 
burden that has not been well captured. Efforts to incorporate these effects and 
refine their estimation, in the form of Disability Adjusted Life years (DALYs) 
are very important to inform the burden of diarrheal diseases and Shigella and 
ETEC specifically. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the 
University of Washington conducted a workshop at the VASE 2018 meeting to 
discuss IHME Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) modelling methods for diarrheal 
diseases, with a focus on ETEC and Shigella estimates in relation to other 
pathogens, including limitations, areas of improvements, and IHME plans for 
future GBD iterations.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important cause of morbidity 
and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective of 
this study was to predict the impact of EBR/GZR on the incidence of liver and 
kidney related complications compared with no treatment (NoTx) and pegylated 
interferon plus ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) in patients with CKD stage 4/5 in 
Vietnam.
METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of the natural history of chronic 
HCV, CKD, and liver disease. Efficacy of EBR/GZR and pegIFN/RBV were derived 
from the C-SURFER trial and a meta-analysis, respectively. We calculated 
lifetime cumulative morbidity and mortality rates, including incidence of 
decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Estimated lifetime incidence of DC was significantly reduced in 
patients receiving EBR/GZR (3.47%) compared to NoTx (18.14%) and pegIFN/RBV 
(9.01%). Estimated incidence of HCC was 1.02%, 21.64%, and 8.90%, and 1.02% in 
patients receiving EBR/GZR, NoTx, and pegIFN/RBV. EBR/GZR was estimated to 
extend life expectancy by 4.2 and 2.0 years compared with NoTx and pegIFN/RBV.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model predicted that EBR/GZR will significantly reduce the 
incidence of liver-related complications and prolong life in patients with 
chronic HCV GT1 infection and CKD compared with NoTx or pegIFN/RBV.

OBJECTIVE: In the general population, people with mental disorders have 
increased mortality. This association, however, has not been explored in a 
population who at some time were inpatients of a public hospital.
METHODS: The sampling frame was patients admitted to an Australian regional 
public hospital 1996-2010. Those with known mental disorder were compared with 
an equal number of randomly selected patients without known mental disorder, 
matched for age, sex, and year of admission. Mortality outcomes were determined 
by linkage of hospital data and the National Death Index.
RESULTS: We identified 15,356 patients with mental disorder and 15,356 without 
known mental disorder, 25.2% of the former and 17.3% of the latter died during 
the study period. The odds ratio (OR) for death in those with mental disorder 
was 2.20 (95% confidence interval: 2.01-2.41) after adjusting for confounders, 
and their mean age at death was 4.6 years younger (p < 0.001). Other independent 
risk factors for mortality were being Indigenous (OR 1.72, 1.32-2.24), not 
partnered (OR 1.55, 1.36-1.76) or having multiple comorbidities (OR 1.65, 
1.43-1.90). In the model that included multiple interactions, the ORs for death 
in Indigenous patients with mental disorder were markedly higher (6.6-9.5), 
regardless of other risk factors.
DISCUSSION: Among patients with a history of public hospital admission, those 
with mental disorders have higher mortality than those without mental disorders. 
This gap in life expectancy mandates increased attention, by clinicians and 
health services alike, to preventable causes of death in people with mental 
illness.

As life expectancy in people living with HIV (PWH) has increased, the focus of 
management has shifted to preventing and treating chronic illnesses. Regular 
physical activity (PA) has been shown to reduce the impact of HIV on both 
physical and mental health. Our objectives were to assess the PA levels of PWH 
compared to HIV negative controls; investigate factors associated with PA; and 
determine the effect of PA levels on quality of life and mental well-being. We 
recruited 110 PWH and 110 HIV negative controls in this cross-sectional, 
single-centre study. Physical activity, quality of life and mental well-being 
were assessed using the rapid assessment of physical activity tool, EQ-5D-5L 
Questionnaire, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Score. Binary 
logistic regression and multiple linear regression were used to identify factors 
associated with PA levels and mental well-being scores respectively. PWH were 
less likely to meet the WHO-recommended PA requirements compared to controls 
(50.0% vs. 64.5%; p = 0.041) and had significantly lower mental wellbeing and 
quality of life scores. Additionally, in PWH higher PA levels were associated 
with improved self-rated quality of life scores (p = 0.027). Our results suggest 
that targeted exercise programmes could have a beneficial effect on health 
status in PWH.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate the long-term economic 
outcomes of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine use in Chinese patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) whose oral antidiabetic drugs did not 
provide sufficient glycemic control.
METHODS: A published and validated Chinese diabetes health policy model, which 
reflects Chinese T2DM epidemiologic profiles, was used to assess the lifetime 
economic outcomes of microvascular and macrovascular complications and 
mortality. Efficacy and safety, medical expenditure, and utility data were 
derived from the literature, which were assigned to model variables for 
estimating the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, as well as 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of Chinese health care service providers. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
FINDINGS: Compared with insulin glargine, insulin degludec was associated with 
0.0053 QALY at an additional cost of $3278 in our simulated cohort. This outcome 
resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of insulin degludec over 
insulin glargine of $613,443 per QALY gained. The one-way sensitivity analyses 
indicated that the results were sensitive to several model inputs.
IMPLICATIONS: Insulin degludec is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with 
insulin glargine for Chinese patients with T2DM whose disease is inadequately 
controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle and life-environment factors have undergone drastic 
changes in Japan over the last few decades. Further, many molecular 
epidemiologic studies have reported that genetic, epigenetic, and other 
biomarker information may be useful in predicting individual disease risk.
METHODS: The Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study for the Next 
Generation (JPHC-NEXT) was launched in 2011 to identify risk factors for 
lifestyle-related disease, elucidate factors that extend healthy life 
expectancy, and contribute toward personalized healthcare based on our more than 
20 years' experience with the JPHC Study. From 2011 through 2016, a baseline 
survey was conducted at 16 municipalities in seven prefectures across the 
country. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all registered 
residents aged 40-74, which mainly asked about lifestyle factors, such as 
socio-demographic situation, personal medical history, smoking, alcohol and 
dietary habits. We obtained informed consent from each participant to 
participate in this long follow-up study of at least 20 years, including consent 
to the potential use of their residence registry, medical records, medical fee 
receipts, care insurance etc., and to the provision of biospecimens (blood and 
urine), including genomic analysis.
RESULTS: As of December 31, 2016, we have established a population-based cohort 
of 115,385 persons (Response rate 44.1%), among whom 55,278 (47.9% of 
participants) have provided blood and urine samples. The participation rate was 
slightly higher among females and in the older age group.
CONCLUSION: We have established a large-scale population-based cohort for 
next-generation epidemiological study in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Cervical deformity (CD) surgery has become increasingly more common 
and complex, which has also led to reoperations for complications such as distal 
junctional kyphosis (DJK). Cost-utility analysis has yet to be used to analyze 
CD revision surgery in relation to the cost-utility of primary CD surgeries. The 
aim of this study was to determine the cost-utility of revision surgery for CD 
correction.
METHODS: Retrospective review of a multicenter prospective CD database. CD was 
defined as at least one of the following: C2-C7 Cobb >10°, cervical lordosis 
(CL) >10°, cervical sagittal vertical axis (cSVA) >4 cm, chin-brow vertical 
angle (CBVA) >25°. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were calculated by EuroQol 
Five-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Neck Disability Index (NDI) mapped to 
SF-6D index and utilized a 3% discount rate to account for residual decline to 
life expectancy (men: 76.9 years, women: 81.6 years). Medicare reimbursement at 
30 days assigned costs for index procedures (9+ level posterior fusion, 4-8 
level posterior fusion with anterior fusion, 2-3 level posterior fusion with 
anterior fusion, 4-8 level anterior fusion) and revision fusions (2-3 level, 4-8 
level, or 9+ level posterior refusion). Cost per QALY gained was calculated.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine CD patients were included (61.6 years, 65.2% female). CD 
correction for these patients involved a mean 7.7±3.7 levels fused, with 34% 
combined approach surgeries, 49% posterior-only and 17% anterior-only, 19.1% 
three-column osteotomy. Costs for index surgeries ranged from $20,001-55,205, 
with the average cost for this cohort of $44,318 and cost per QALY of $27,267. 
Eleven revision surgeries (mean levels fused 10.3) occurred up to 1-year, with 
an average cost of $41,510. Indications for revisions were DJK (5/11), 
neurologic impairment [4], infection [1], prominent/painful instrumentation [1]. 
Average QALYs gained was 1.62 per revision patient. Cost was $28,138 per QALY 
for reoperations.
CONCLUSIONS: CD revisions had a cost of $28,138 per QALY, in addition to the 
$27,267 per QALY for primary CD surgeries. For primary CD patients, CD surgery 
has the potential to be cost effective, with the caveats that a patient 
livelihood extends long enough to have the benefits and durability of the 
surgery is maintained. Efforts in research and surgical technique development 
should emphasize minimization of reoperation causes just as DJK that 
significantly affect cost utility of these surgeries to bring cost-utility to an 
acceptable range.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare neuromuscular disorder with a 
spectrum of severity related to age at onset and the number of SMN2 gene copies. 
Infantile-onset (≤ 6 months of age) is the most severe spinal muscular atrophy 
and is the leading monogenetic cause of infant mortality; patients with 
later-onset (> 6 months of age) spinal muscular atrophy can survive into 
adulthood. Nusinersen is a new treatment for spinal muscular atrophy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
nusinersen for the treatment of patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular 
atrophy and later-onset spinal muscular atrophy in Sweden.
METHODS: One Markov cohort health-state transition model was developed for each 
population. The infantile-onset and later-onset models were based on the 
efficacy results from the ENDEAR phase III trial and the CHERISH phase III 
trial, respectively. The cost effectiveness of nusinersen in both models was 
compared with standard of care in Sweden.
RESULTS: For a time horizon of 40 years in the infantile-onset model and 80 
years in the later-onset model, treatment with nusinersen resulted in 3.86 and 
9.54 patient incremental quality-adjusted life-years and 0.02 and 2.39 caregiver 
incremental quality-adjusted life-years and an incremental cost of 21.9 and 38.0 
million SEK (Swedish krona), respectively. These results translated into 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (including caregiver quality-adjusted 
life-years) of 5.64 million SEK (€551,300) and 3.19 million SEK (€311,800) per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained in the infantile-onset model and later-onset 
model, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with nusinersen resulted in overall survival and 
quality-adjusted life-year benefits but with incremental costs above 21 million 
SEK (€2 million) [mainly associated with maintenance treatment with nusinersen 
over a patient's lifespan]. Nusinersen was not cost effective when using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of 2 million SEK (€195,600), which has been 
considered in a recent discussion by the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Agency as a reasonable threshold for rare disease. Nonetheless, nusinersen 
gained reimbursement in Sweden in 2017 for paediatric patients (below 18 years 
old) with spinal muscular atrophy type I-IIIa.

Suffering from Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review.

The disease burden associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is 
substantial, with affected individuals having a shorter life expectancy and a 
high risk of severe physical comorbid conditions. These individuals are more 
likely to smoke and have a longer smoking history compared to the general 
population. Furthermore, use of antipsychotic drugs has also been linked to 
active smoking. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory 
condition affecting elderly individuals with a long smoking history, so it would 
be expected that individuals suffering from major mental disorders may exhibit a 
higher prevalence of COPD compared to the general population. We searched the 
databases Pubmed and Scopus for observational studies of at least 200 patients 
including at least one group suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 
and a comparison group of individuals at risk of COPD. The initial search, along 
with the data extraction process and the risk of bias assessment were carried 
out independently by the two reviewers. Eight studies were included. The risk of 
bias was substantial as most studies did not adequately address confounding 
variables. A pooled analysis showed a greater likelihood of suffering from 
comorbid COPD compared with the general population both for schizophrenic (OR 
1.573, 1.439-1.720) and bipolar individuals (OR 1.551, 1.452-1.658). Based on 
these findings, COPD is more common in individuals suffering from major mental 
illness compared to the general population. Further research is required to 
ascertain whether smoking is the only cause and develop strategies for the 
prevention of COPD in these high-risk groups.

BACKGROUND: There are limited management options available for people with Type 
III intestinal failure (IF), with home parenteral nutrition (HPN) being the main 
treatment option. The aim of this research is to compare patient preferences in 
managing Type III IF using time trade-off (TTO) methodology and to determine 
which factors have the greatest impact on health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL).
METHODS: An interviewer-administered telephone survey was conducted on a 
cross-sectional cohort of 19 HPN participants. The survey was designed to 
measure HRQoL using a TTO methodology. Four different treatment options were 
presented, and participants decided how many years of life they would trade to 
have access to the treatment and hence a different health state. The 4 scenarios 
included reduction in line infections, optimization of care, small bowel growth 
(teduglutide), and intestinal transplantation. Health state utility scores were 
calculated.
RESULTS: The median health utility score for optimization of care and small 
bowel growth (teduglutide) were lowest (0.5; range 0-1) meaning a greater desire 
for this treatment. Intestinal transplant had the highest median utility score 
(1.0; range 0-1) indicating less willingness for this treatment option.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study to use TTO methodology assessing 
treatment options in people with IF requiring HPN. Results indicate people 
requiring HPN make careful decisions when considering treatment options. 
Facilities providing HPN services should focus on optimization of current care, 
which is highly valued by their patients.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major disease 
burden which accounts for 5% of all deaths globally, with most of those (>90%) 
occurring in lower to middle income countries (LMIC). It is also emerging as an 
important modifiable dementia risk factor.
OBJECTIVE: To address the knowledge gap surrounding the nature of the 
associations between COPD, dementia, and mortality, and the geographical 
variation of those associations in LMIC.
METHODS: Data from the 10/66 study surveying 15,394 participants (mean age 74 
years, 62% female) across 8 countries was used to estimate the prevalence of 
self-reported COPD and its association with incident dementia and premature 
death. Proportional sub-hazards models using a cumulative incidence function 
were applied to identify the probability of incident dementia onset given the 
risk of premature death, with estimates pooled across countries via random 
effect meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Over the 3-year follow-up, almost 10% of participants developed 
dementia and 14% were deceased. COPD was not significantly associated with 
dementia incidence except in Cuba. However, fully adjusted models indicated that 
individuals with COPD were at a 28% increased risk of premature death, a trend 
present across most countries when analyzed individually.
CONCLUSION: The link between COPD and dementia is currently somewhat different 
and weaker in LMIC than in developed countries. This may be because premature 
death in the populations studied mask the development of clinical dementia. 
Given the global trend toward increased life expectancy, it is critical that the 
disease burden associated with COPD be addressed without delay if a further rise 
in dementia prevalence associated with COPD is to be avoided in LMIC.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) among people living in detention (PLD) is 
typically high in many countries including Switzerland, where it is estimated 
that the HCV prevalence rate is between 5.7% and 6.2%. In Switzerland, the 
existing screening strategy involves routine screening of PLD who indicate they 
are from HCV high-risk populations based on questionnaire responses upon entry 
to the detention center, rather than an offer to screen all PLD.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a Swiss healthcare provider 
perspective was conducted by combining a 5-year decision tree screening model 
with results from a Markov model of HCV treatment outcomes. This model explored 
the cost-effectiveness of increased HCV screening to cover all PLD compared to 
the current approach, using a standard test package and subsequent treatment 
with a single-tablet regimen in Swiss custodial settings. Sensitivity and 
scenario analyses examined the uncertainty of results.
RESULTS: At the willingness-to-pay threshold of 100 000 Swiss Francs (CHF) per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), comprehensive general screening was 
cost-effective compared to current risk-based screening, with a base case 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 14 312 per QALY. The net monetary 
benefit of screening the whole PLD population was CHF 23 298 046 and CHF 4298 
per person. The proportion of PLD tested was predicted to increase from 13.6% to 
67.0% under comprehensive screening.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that comprehensive screening strategies in 
detention centers in Switzerland can be cost-effective, with the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis estimating an 82.3% probability of cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) has long been consumed for 
its unique flavor and composition of health-promoting phytonutrients. However, 
breeding efforts to improve fruit quality in blueberry have been greatly 
hampered by the lack of adequate genomic resources and a limited understanding 
of the underlying genetics encoding key traits. The genome of highbush blueberry 
has been particularly challenging to assemble due, in large part, to its 
polyploid nature and genome size.
FINDINGS: Here, we present a chromosome-scale and haplotype-phased genome 
assembly of the cultivar "Draper," which has the highest antioxidant levels 
among a diversity panel of 71 cultivars and 13 wild Vaccinium species. We 
leveraged this genome, combined with gene expression and metabolite data 
measured across fruit development, to identify candidate genes involved in the 
biosynthesis of important phytonutrients among other metabolites associated with 
superior fruit quality. Genome-wide analyses revealed that both polyploidy and 
tandem gene duplications modified various pathways involved in the biosynthesis 
of key phytonutrients. Furthermore, gene expression analyses hint at the 
presence of a spatial-temporal specific dominantly expressed subgenome including 
during fruit development.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings and the reference genome will serve as a valuable 
resource to guide future genome-enabled breeding of important agronomic traits 
in highbush blueberry.

Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the differences in life expectancy with and without 
cognitive impairment (CI) by educational levels and sex in Brazil.
DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study.
SETTING: The sample was drawn from three waves (2000, 2006, and 2010) of the 
Health, Well-Being, and Aging Study (Saúde, bem-estar e envelhecimento; SABE) 
collected in São Paulo, Brazil.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 60 years and older (N = 2116).
MEASUREMENTS: Educational levels were estimated in the baseline wave (2000), 
cognition was assessed in all waves, and mortality data were obtained through 
the state and municipal mortality system in Brazil. Interpolation of Markov 
chain methods was used to estimate life expectancy with and without CI by 
education and sex.
RESULTS: Life expectancy without CI at the age of 60 years was 13.0 years among 
men with no education and 17.6 years among their counterparts with 8 years of 
schooling. On the other hand, life expectancy with CI was higher among men with 
no education than those with more education (3.2 and 0.6 years, respectively). 
Among 60-year-old women without education, life expectancy without CI reached 
16.2 years, but it was considerably higher among more educated women (22.7 
years). Life expectancy with CI reached 4.5 years among women aged 60 years with 
no education, vs 1.0 year among women with 8 years of schooling.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults older than 60 years with no education live shorter lives and 
with longer periods of CI than those with education. Women in São Paulo live 
longer lives than men, but they live with CI for a greater number of years.
