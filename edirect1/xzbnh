higher cost, and 13·1% were related to dominated drugs (i.e. less effective and 
more expensive than the comparator). The median overall ICUR was €40 242 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with a minimum ICUR of €6311/QALY and a 
maximum ICUR of €974,917/QALY.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that orphan drugs can meet 
traditional reimbursement thresholds. Considering a threshold of £30,000/QALY, 
in this study, ten (52·6%) of a total of 19 orphan drugs for which data were 
available meet the threshold. As much as fifteen orphan drugs (78·9%) are 
eligible for reimbursement if a threshold of €80,000/QALY is considered.

OBJECTIVES: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) is a key 
dimerization partner for HER family members and is associated with resistance to 
other HER family receptor-targeted therapeutics. This study evaluated the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of patritumab (U3-1287), a 
fully human anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody, in combination with erlotinib, an 
epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with 
previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study enrolled patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, life expectancy >3 
months and who had progressed after at least one prior course of chemotherapy 
(excluding erlotinib). This open-label study included two parts: dose escalation 
(Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). In Part 1, patients received intravenous 
patritumab 9 or 18 mg/kg every 3 weeks in addition to per-oral erlotinib 150 
mg/day daily. In Part 2, patients received the recommended dose of patritumab as 
determined in Part 1. Adverse event rates, pharmacokinetics and tumor responses 
were determined.
RESULTS: Twenty-four Japanese patients received patritumab at 9 mg/kg (n=3) or 
18 mg/kg (n=21), and erlotinib. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported, 
indicating the maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. The most frequent adverse 
events were gastrointestinal or skin toxicities, which were generally mild and 
manageable. Patritumab pharmacokinetics were similar to those reported in 
previous studies. The median progression-free survival (95% confidence interval) 
was 44.0 (22.0-133.0) days for the EGFR wild-type group (n=9) and 107.0 
(74.0-224.0) days for the EGFR-activating mutation group (n=13). Evaluation of 
biomarkers by immunohistochemical analysis did not indicate a relationship 
between efficacy and HER3 expression in tumor tissues.
CONCLUSION: Patritumab in combination with erlotinib was well tolerated and the 
efficacy of the combination was encouraging, especially in patients where prior 
gefitinib treatment failed.

BACKGROUND: The goal of the study was to compare the effects of isokinetic and 
isotonic strengthening program on the changes of muscle strength, functional 
capacity, life quality, and inflammatory cytokines in hemiparetic patients 
within 6 months of stroke attack.
METHODS: Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned into either isotonic 
training group or isokinetic training group. Both training programs were carried 
out 5 days a week for a total of 4 weeks. Outcome measures included the peak 
isometric torque of knees at 90° flexion, the peak torque of knees extension and 
flexion at angular velocities 60°/s and 120°/s, Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health 
Survey Questionnaire, Timed Up and Go test, and inflammatory cytokines including 
high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α.
RESULTS: Seven patients were not able to complete the training program and were 
excluded from our study. The results from the remaining 24 patients showed that 
there were more peak torque, and SF-36 items significantly improved in the 
isokinetic training group compared with the isotonic group. The Timed Up and Go 
test and interleukin-6 were improved in both groups, but tumor necrosis factor-α 
was improved in only the isokinetic group. There were no significant differences 
between the improvements of the 2 groups except the isokinetic flexion torque at 
60°/s and 120°/s.
CONCLUSIONS: Early strengthening exercise is important for subacute stroke 
patients, and isokinetic program, if accessible, can bring more significant 
benefits for them.

OBJECTIVE: Individuals suffering from mental illness have one to two decades 
reduced life expectancy. The increased morbidity and mortality is mainly due to 
cardiometabolic disorders. Despite these numbers, international studies give 
evidence that diagnoses and treatment of metabolic risk factors in psychiatric 
patients is insufficient. We assume that in Germany metabolic risk factors are 
also underdiagnosed and insufficiently treated.
METHODS: We tested for the frequency of diagnoses of the metabolic risk factors 
obesity, nicotine dependence and abuse, disorders of lipid metabolism, 
hypertension and diabetes in 139 307 cases of residential treatment and 
semi-residential care in 47 psychiatric hospitals in Germany in the year 2012. 
Data were derived from the VIPP(indicators of treatment quality in psychiatry 
and psychosomatic medicine)-project, a project that comprises the routine data 
of psychiatric hospitals, that are sent to the InEK (institute for the lump sum 
payment system for hospitals). Frequencies were compared with prevalence of 
metabolic risk factors in the German population and prevalences of metabolic 
risk factors found in psychiatric patients in international studies.
RESULTS: In particular obesity (2.8 %), disorders of lipid metabolism (2.8 %) 
and nicotin dependence (4.2 %) were underdiagnosed. We assume that also diabetes 
(6.8 %) and hypertension (17.7 %) were underdiagnosed.
CONCLUSION: The results give evidence that metabolic risk factors are 
underdiagnosed and possibly insufficiently treated in German psychiatric 
hospitals. We cannot exclude that the results might also be due to poor 
documentation. It remains to be seen if the introduction of the PEPP (the new 
lump sum payment system in German psychiatry) will heighten the level of 
attention for metabolic risk factors and their treatment.

Hormone replacement therapy and longevity.

Comhaire F(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

To assess whether hormone replacement therapy influences longevity, an analysis 
was made of published life tables allowing for the calculation of the relative 
benefit of hormone replacement therapy on longevity in men with late onset 
hypogonadism and in post-menopausal women. It was found that testosterone 
replacement therapy of men suffering from late onset hypogonadism increased 
survival rate by 9-10% in 5 years, similar to that of eugonadal, non-LOH men 
with normal endogenous testosterone secretion. Oestrogen replacement therapy 
resulted in increased survival by 2.6% in 5 years. It is concluded that hormone 
replacement therapy increases longevity.

OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of novel treatments for elderly (≥66 yr) 
patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in daily practice by comparing real-world 
effects [overall survival (OS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and 
costs over time. Also, we calculate cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences 
commonly prescribed to predict effects and costs if patients had received a 
different treatment sequence.
METHODS: Real-world data including patient and disease characteristics, 
treatment information and resource use were collected from 1054 elderly patients 
with MM. Patients received first-line treatment during 2004-2007 (cohort 1) and 
2008-2013 (cohort 2). The two cohorts were compared using a patient-level 
simulation (PLS) model comprising regression models which used patient and 
disease characteristics to estimate time to next treatment and death. Effects 
and costs from cohort 2 were compared to 4 commonly prescribed real-world 
sequences.
RESULTS: Utilisation of novel agents was higher for cohort 2 compared to cohort 
1. Modelled average OS for cohort 1 was 38 months (median 25) and total costs 
€44,200. OS for cohort 2 was 42 months (median 28) and total costs €69,017. The 
model identified potential OS gains if all patients were to be treated using 
combinations containing thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib in that 
particular order. This sequence had, compared to real-world treatment, the most 
favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, €24,618 per life year gained 
and €34,875 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our patient-level model enabled to study the effects and costs of 
entire treatment sequences and to compare real-world treatment patterns over 
time. Increased utilisation of novel agents improved survival and increased 
costs for real-world patients with MM in the Netherlands.

Kiwi fruits (Actinidia deliciosa C.F. Liang et A.R. Ferguson) were treated by 
prestorage conditioning (20 °C for 2 days), 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 1 ppm 
for 16 h) and conditioning plus 1-MCP. After the treatment the fruits were 
immediately stored at 0 °C during 24 weeks. Flesh firmness gradually decreased 
with storage time and the rate of its loss was lower in 1-MCP and conditioning 
plus 1-MCP treatments than those of control or conditioning. However, SSC, 
acidity and pH did not change among treatments. Starch content decreased during 
the storage time regardless of treatments. Oppositely the amount of reducing 
sugars increased at the same duration of the treatments. Rate and incidence of 
fruit decay was the lowest in fruit treated with conditioning plus 1-MCP 
treatment. Fruit decay mainly caused pathogen Botrytis cinerea and its rate 
significantly decreased with conditioning plus 1-MCP treatment. Ethylene and 
respiration abruptly increased after 8 weeks of storage, but their contents were 
lower in 1-MCP and conditioning plus 1-MCP. Total soluble phenolics, flavonoids, 
and total antioxidant capacities were much higher than in other treatments. Kiwi 
fruits treated with conditioning plus 1-MCP extended the shelf life by reducing 
the rate of fruit decay and softening during the storage. The bioactive 
compounds and total antioxidant status of fruits increased during the treatment.

Strawberries are known to be significant source of the nutraceuticals; however, 
rapid perishable property of this fruit is very important issue. Up to now, 
extension of this fruit is still the focus of scientific and industrial interest 
in the worldwide. Therefore, of the known nutraceuticals, myrtle essential oil 
in this study is intended to use for extending the storage of strawberries. 
Strawberries were individually immersed in the treatment solutions of 0.1 % 
myrtle oil, 0.5 % myrtle oil and then placed in Modified Atmosphere Packaging 
(MAP) for 8 days at 5 °C. The control fruits without myrtle oil treatment were 
also placed in MAP and stored under the same condition. Treatment of myrtle oil 
decreased the weight and the fruit firmness loss. Furthermore, titratable 
acidity (TA), pH and colour value did not display significant changes during 
storage. Fluctuations were observed in the vitamin C, total soluble solids 
(TSS), TSS/TA content and microbial growth. The O2 concentration in MAP 
decreased from 21 % to around 15 %, whereas, CO2 concentration varied from 6.0 
to 6.9 % in the treatments by the 8th day of storage time. The delay of flesh 
firmness, weight loss, vitamin C loss and increasing CO2 concentration in MAP, 
best sensory quality as well as limiting the growth of microbial parameters in 
concern was attained through the use of 0.5 % myrtle oil, suggesting that 0.5 % 
myrtle oil showed more pronounced activity than 0.1 % myrtle oil and control in 
maintaining the fruit quality and shelf life of fruits during MAP storage.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: an important differential diagnosis of stroke in 
the elderly.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) accounts for approximately 10-20% of 
spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). This figure is thought to be higher 
in the elderly population. With the increasing life expectancy of our 
population, we anticipate that the prevalence of CAA- related ICH will increase 
in tandem. Although CAA-related ICH and hypertension-related ICH are distinct 
entities based on histopathology and imaging, the clinical presentation of the 
two conditions is similar. The use of brain computed tomography (CT) scans 
remain the ICH imaging modality of choice in Malaysia due to its availability, 
cost, and sensitivity in detecting acute bleeds. On the other hand, the use of 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with susceptibility-weighted imaging 
(SWI) sequencing enables the clinician to determine the presence of chronic 
blood products in the brain, especially clinically silent microbleeds associated 
with CAA. However, the use of brain MRI scans in our country is limited and 
leads to a blurring of lines when differentiating between hypertension-related 
ICH and CAA-related ICH. How this misrepresentation affects the management of 
these conditions is unclear. In this study, we present two cases of ICH to 
illustrate this point and to serve as a springboard to question current practice 
and promote discussion.

STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
OBJECTIVE: We report a patient who was successfully treated with total en bloc 
spondylectomy (TES) for T7 metastasis after living donor liver transplantation 
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal metastasis from HCC has a poor prognosis. 
There are only a few studies on surgical outcomes of spinal metastasis from HCC. 
Because of the high surgical morbidity and short life expectancy in patients 
with HCC with spinal metastasis, TES is not considered in these patients, 
although several studies have reported satisfactory results for TES for some 
types of metastatic spinal tumors. Liver transplantation (LT) is the curative 
treatment option for early HCC. However, the recurrence of HCC is a possible 
problem after LT, although no reports on surgery for spinal metastasis following 
LT for HCC have been published. We report on the first case of a patient who was 
successfully treated with TES for T7 metastasis after living donor LT for HCC.
METHODS: The patient was a 65-year-old man, who had undergone living donor LT 
for HCC 2 years before. His main symptom was progressive gait disturbance 
because of the spinal cord compression by the tumor at T7. Radiology and 
pathology examinations revealed a solitary metastasis at T7 with neither 
recurrence in the liver nor metastasis in the other organs. We performed TES 
using a pedicle screw system and a mesh cage filled with frozen autografts.
RESULTS: After surgery, the patient showed clear improvement in neurological 
symptoms. At 3 months after surgery, a T4 metastasis was detected with magnetic 
resonance imaging, and the patient was treated with heavy ion radiotherapy. He 
could walk without a cane and there was no evidence of recurrence at 1.5 years 
after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Solitary spinal metastasis of HCC may become an indication for TES 
if liver function improves after LT.

Cancer is mainly a disease of older people. Costs for cancer prevention and 
control are rising due to increased life expectancy and the large cohort of 
aging “baby boomers.” An effective strategy for better understanding processes 
related to cancer and aging across the entire cancer continuum (i.e., from 
prevention through to end-of-life care) is to approach this challenge 
collaboratively. Communication-focused research is an area of collaborative 
study for cancer and aging researchers that would provide evidence regarding the 
most effective means for reaching older adults with messages about cancer 
prevention, control, and quality of life issues. Specifically we recommend 
research that is guided by multidisciplinary communication frameworks, involves 
health care providers, incorporates an intergenerational and family-centered 
approach into designing and implementing empirical studies, and creates 
culturally appropriate messaging through community-engaged research.

Pharmacotherapy and other therapeutic modalities for managing Arrhythmogenic 
Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy.

Rigato I(1), Corrado D, Basso C, Zorzi A, Pilichou K, Bauce B, Thiene G.

Padua, Italy.

Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetically 
determined rare cardiomyopathy (1 in 5000 to 1 in 2000 in the general 
population), which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death (SD). 
The classic form of the disease has a predilection for the right ventricle (RV), 
but recognition of left-dominant and biventricular variants led to the broader 
term "Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy". The disease affects men more frequently 
than women and becomes clinically overt usually from the second to the fourth 
decade of life. Treatment consists of restriction of physical exercise, 
antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and ICD implantation. These treatments 
have the potential to change the natural history of the disease by protecting 
against SD and offering a good-quality and nearly normal life-expectancy. 
Antiarrhythmic drugs play an important role in terms of reduction of both the 
number and the complexity of arrhythmias, but they do not reduce the risk of SD. 
The results of catheter ablation are poor because of the high rate of VT 
recurrence. ICD should be reserved to selected patients after an accurate risk 
stratification. The clinical challenge is to improve risk stratification for 
better identification of those patients who most benefit from the above 
therapies. Unfortunately, a curative therapy is not yet available.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2015 Apr 21;162(8):I-28.

BACKGROUND: Evidence to guide primary prevention in adults aged 75 years or 
older is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To project the population impact and cost-effectiveness of statin 
therapy in adults aged 75 years or older.
DESIGN: Forecasting study using the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a 
Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Trial, cohort, and nationally representative data sources.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. adults aged 75 to 94 years.
TIME HORIZON: 10 years.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care system.
INTERVENTION: Statins for primary prevention based on low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol threshold of 4.91 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), or 
3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL); presence of diabetes; or 10-year risk score of at least 
7.5%.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CHD) 
death, disability-adjusted life-years, and costs.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: All adults aged 75 years or older in the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have a 10-year risk score greater than 
7.5%. If statins had no effect on functional limitation or cognitive impairment, 
all primary prevention strategies would prevent MIs and CHD deaths and be 
cost-effective. Treatment of all adults aged 75 to 94 years would result in 8 
million additional users and prevent 105 000 (4.3%) incident MIs and 68 000 
(2.3%) CHD deaths at an incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-year of 
$25 200.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: An increased relative risk for functional 
limitation or mild cognitive impairment of 1.10 to 1.29 could offset the 
cardiovascular benefits.
LIMITATION: Limited trial evidence targeting primary prevention in adults aged 
75 years or older.
CONCLUSION: At effectiveness similar to that in trials, statins are projected to 
be cost-effective for primary prevention; however, even a small increase in 
geriatric-specific adverse effects could offset the cardiovascular benefit. 
Improved data on the potential benefits and harms of statins are needed to 
inform decision making.

Noonan syndrome is a congenital, common, hereditary disorder. Facial 
dysmorphism, growth retardation, and various heart defects are typical clinical 
features. In patients with minor cardiac pathology, life expectancy is normal. 
We report a case of renal transplant in a pediatric patient with Noonan syndrome 
that ended with death of the patient. Our patient presented with unexpected and 
refractory postoperative neurological complications that were unresponsive to 
intensive therapy, and the patient died because of secondary complications.

accuracy.

Although age-related deficits in emotion perception have been established using 
photographs of individuals, the extension of these findings to dynamic displays 
and dyads is just beginning. Similarly, most eye-tracking research in the person 
perception literature, including those that study age differences, have focused 
on individual attributes gleaned from static images; to our knowledge, no 
previous research has considered cue use in dyadic judgments with eye-tracking. 
The current study employed a Brunswikian lens model analysis in conjunction with 
eye-tracking measurements to study age differences in the judgment of rapport, a 
social construct comprised of mutual attentiveness, positive feelings, and 
coordination between interacting partners. Judgment accuracy and cue utilization 
of younger (n = 47) and older (n = 46) adults were operationalized as 
correlations between a perceiver's judgments and criterion values within a set 
of 34 brief interaction videos in which 2 opposite sex college students 
discussed a controversial topic. No age differences emerged in the accuracy of 
judgments; however, pathways to accuracy differed by age: Younger adults' 
judgments relied on some behavioral cues more than older adults. In addition, 
eye-tracking analyses revealed that older adults spent more time looking at the 
bodies of the targets in the videos, whereas younger adults spent more time 
looking at the targets' heads. The contributions from both the lens model and 
eye-tracking findings provide distinct but complementary insights to our 
understanding of age-related continuities and shifts in social perceptual 
processing.

U.S. and International In-Hospital Costs of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: 
a Systematic Review.

Harvey MJ(1), Gaies MG, Prosser LA.

University of Michigan, 1415 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-2029, USA,

CONTEXT: The in-hospital costs of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 
have not been well established.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in-hospital costs of ECMO technology in both US and 
non-US settings for all patient types.
DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of English-language articles, using the PubMed, 
Embase, Web of Science and EconLit databases. Searches consisted of the terms 
'ECMO' AND 'health expenditures' or 'resource use' or 'costs' or 'cost analysis' 
or 'cost(-)effectiveness' or 'cost(-)benefit' or 'cost(-)utility' or 
'economic(-)evaluation' or 'economic' or 'QALY' or 'cost per quality-adjusted 
life year'.
STUDY SELECTION: Only full scientific research articles were included. The 
exclusion criteria included papers that focused on pumpless ECMO, simulation 
training or decision support systems; papers that did not include human subjects 
or were not written in English; papers that did not mention ECMO, costs, 
economics or resource utilization; and papers that included only 
outside-hospital, infrastructure capital or device capital costs.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction was completed by one author, using predefined 
criteria.
RESULTS: From the database searches, 1371 results were returned, 226 records 
underwent a full review and 18 studies were included in the final review. Three 
papers studied adult populations, two studied adult and paediatric populations, 
five studied only paediatric populations, one studied a paediatric and neonatal 
population, and the remaining seven exclusively examined ECMO in neonatal 
populations. The sample sizes ranged from 8 to 8753 patients. ECMO for 
respiratory conditions was the most common diagnosis category, followed by 
congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and then cardiac conditions. Most papers 
(n = 14) used retrospective cost collection. Only eight papers stated the 
perspective of the cost analysis. The results show a large variation in the cost 
of ECMO over multiple cost categories (e.g., range of total in-hospital costs of 
treatment: USD 42,554-537,554 [in 2013 values]). In the U.S.A., the reported 
costs of ECMO were highest for CDH repair, followed by cardiac conditions, and 
lowest for respiratory conditions. The US charges were highest for cardiac 
conditions. Outside the U.S.A., the ECMO cost was highest for cardiac 
conditions, followed by respiratory conditions, and lowest for CDH repair. No 
non-US studies reported charges.
CONCLUSION: The current literature shows that a large variation exists in the 
in-hospital cost estimates for ECMO. Further research is needed to understand 
how the diagnosis, setting and other factors relate to this variation in the 
cost of this technology. Reliable costing methodologies and cost information 
will be critical to inform policymakers and stakeholders wishing to maximize the 
value of advanced medical technologies such as ECMO.

Burden of epilepsy in Colombia.

Méndez-Ayala A(1), Nariño D, Rosselli D.

BACKGROUND: Epilepsy lays an important burden on healthcare systems and society 
in general. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) have been developed to 
compare the burden of this disease both between conditions and between 
geographical boundaries. With improving data on disease incidence and prevalence 
in Colombia, we can refine our DALYs-based estimates.
METHODS: Using different strategies, including the official healthcare provision 
database and death certificates, as well as extrapolation from published 
neuroepidemiologic studies, we estimated the incidence and prevalence by age 
groups, disease duration and attributable mortality. With this information we 
calculated DALYs for the year 2012.
RESULTS: Overall, it was found that epilepsy was responsible for 0.88% of all 
deaths in Colombia. A total of 5.25 DALYs per 1,000 person-years are lost due to 
epilepsy in Colombia, 75% of which (3.91 DALYs) are due to premature mortality, 
with a higher burden in men (6.12 DALYs) than in women (4.41 DALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: We reported new estimations on epilepsy incidence and prevalence by 
age groups in Colombia and conclude that DALYs lost due to epilepsy in Colombia 
are almost double the previous figure, mostly because of the underestimation of 
attributable mortality. With this figure, epilepsy ranks 12th instead of 19th in 
the list of the most important causes of DALYs lost.

Despite intensive surgical excision, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the 
current life expectancy for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme is 
only 12 to 15months. One of the approaches being explored to increase 
chemotherapeutic efficacy is to locally deliver chemotherapeutics encapsulated 
within degradable, polymeric microspheres. This review describes the techniques 
used to formulate drug encapsulated microspheres targeted for intracranial tumor 
therapy and how microsphere characteristics such as drug loading and 
encapsulation efficiency can be tuned based on formulation parameters. Further, 
the results of in vitro studies are discussed, detailing the varied drug release 
profiles obtained and validation of drug efficacy. Finally, in vivo results are 
summarized, highlighting the study design and the effectiveness of the drug 
encapsulated microspheres applied intracranially.

The life expectancies and causes of death were evaluated in 299,555 dogs insured 
in Japan between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011, of which 4169 dogs died during 
this period. The overall life expectancy of dogs was 13.7 years. The probability 
of death was high in the first year of life, lowest in the second and third 
years, and increased exponentially after 3 years of age. The life expectancy was 
13.8 years in the <5 kg body weight group, 14.2 years in the 5-10 kg body weight 
group, 13.6 years in the 10-20 kg body weight group, 12.5 years in the 20-40 kg 
body weight group and 10.6 years in the ≥40 kg body weight group. As body weight 
increases, life expectancy tended to decrease except in the <5 kg body weight 
group. The probability of death increased as dogs got older for most potential 
causes of death. Neoplasia resulted in the highest probability of death, 
especially in the large and giant breed groups. Cardiovascular system disorders 
were the second major cause of death and the toy group had a probability of 
death significantly higher than the other breed groups at age 12+.

Physiological adaptations to weight loss and factors favouring weight regain.

Greenway FL(1).

Baton Rouge, LA, USA.

Obesity is a major global health problem and predisposes individuals to several 
comorbidities that can affect life expectancy. Interventions based on lifestyle 
modification (for example, improved diet and exercise) are integral components 
in the management of obesity. However, although weight loss can be achieved 
through dietary restriction and/or increased physical activity, over the long 
term many individuals regain weight. The aim of this article is to review the 
research into the processes and mechanisms that underpin weight regain after 
weight loss and comment on future strategies to address them. Maintenance of 
body weight is regulated by the interaction of a number of processes, 
encompassing homoeostatic, environmental and behavioural factors. In 
homoeostatic regulation, the hypothalamus has a central role in integrating 
signals regarding food intake, energy balance and body weight, while an 
'obesogenic' environment and behavioural patterns exert effects on the amount 
and type of food intake and physical activity. The roles of other environmental 
factors are also now being considered, including sleep debt and iatrogenic 
effects of medications, many of which warrant further investigation. 
Unfortunately, physiological adaptations to weight loss favour weight regain. 
These changes include perturbations in the levels of circulating 
appetite-related hormones and energy homoeostasis, in addition to alterations in 
nutrient metabolism and subjective appetite. To maintain weight loss, 
individuals must adhere to behaviours that counteract physiological adaptations 
and other factors favouring weight regain. It is difficult to overcome 
physiology with behaviour. Weight loss medications and surgery change the 
physiology of body weight regulation and are the best chance for long-term 
success. An increased understanding of the physiology of weight loss and regain 
will underpin the development of future strategies to support overweight and 
obese individuals in their efforts to achieve and maintain weight loss.

BACKGROUND: We have shown that a case-based training programme for general 
practitioners, aimed to implement evidence-based care of patients at very high 
risk of coronary death, was associated with decreased mortality. In the present 
study we assessed long-term cost-effectiveness of this programme.
DESIGN: Registry-based long-term cost-effectiveness analysis on a clinical 
trial.
METHODS: Costs of the programme, health care, drugs and added years of life were 
included. Costs were adjusted to 2012 level and discounted by 3%. Life-years 
gained were estimated as the difference between the survival curves of the 
trial. The effectiveness measure, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), was 
constructed by multiplying each life-year with a quality of life weight 
corresponding to the health status of that year. QALYs were also discounted by 
3%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as the incremental 
cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The number of undiscounted life-years gained was 365 days in the 
intervention group as compared to control (p = 0.02). The number of discounted 
QALYs gained was 0.66. The net increase in total costs was estimated as 17,862 € 
when costs of added years of life were included and 4621 € exclusive of these 
costs. This implied an ICER of 27,063 € per gained QALY. This ICER is well below 
commonly used threshold values of the societal willingness to pay for a QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that a case-based training programme of general 
practitioners is a cost-effective way to save years of life in patients with 
very high risk of coronary death.

A Comparison of Japan and U.K. SF-6D Health-State Valuations Using a 
Non-Parametric Bayesian Method.

samer.kharroubi@york.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: There is interest in the extent to which valuations of health may 
differ between different countries and cultures, but few studies have compared 
preference values of health states obtained in different countries.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate and compare two directly elicited valuations 
for SF-6D health states between the Japan and U.K. general adult populations 
using Bayesian methods.
METHODS: We analysed data from two SF-6D valuation studies where, using similar 
standard gamble protocols, values for 241 and 249 states were elicited from 
representative samples of the Japan and U.K. general adult populations, 
respectively. We estimate a function applicable across both countries that 
explicitly accounts for the differences between them, and is estimated using 
data from both countries.
RESULTS: The results suggest that differences in SF-6D health-state valuations 
between the Japan and U.K. general populations are potentially important. The 
magnitude of these country-specific differences in health-state valuation 
depended, however, in a complex way on the levels of individual dimensions.
CONCLUSION: The new Bayesian non-parametric method is a powerful approach for 
analysing data from multiple nationalities or ethnic groups, to understand the 
differences between them and potentially to estimate the underlying utility 
functions more efficiently.

A comparison of Reduced Life Expectancy (RLE) model with Haber's Rule to 
describe effects of exposure time on toxicity.

The Reduced Life Expectancy (RLE) Model (LC50 = [ln(NLE) - ln(LT50)]/d) has been 
proposed as an alternative to Haber's Rule. The model is based on a linear 
relationship between LC50 (Lethal Exposure Concentration) and lnLT50 (Lethal 
Exposure Time) and uses NLE (Normal Life Expectancy) as a limiting point as well 
as a long term data point (where d is a constant). The purposes of this paper 
were to compare the RLE Model with Haber's Rule with available toxicity data and 
to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. When LT50 is 
relatively short and LC50 is high, Haber's Rule is consistent with the RLE 
model. But the difference between the two was evident in the situation when LT50 
is relatively long and LC50 is low where the RLE model is a marked departure 
from Haber's Rule. The RLE Model can be used to appropriately evaluate long term 
effects of exposure.
