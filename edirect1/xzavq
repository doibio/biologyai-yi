recent stated-preference study. The estimated costs include defibrillators 
(including expendables/maintenance), training, hospitalisation/health care, fire 
service call-outs, overhead resources and the dispatch centre. The estimated 
number of additional saved lives was 16 per year, yielding a benefit-cost ratio 
of 36. The cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was estimated to be 
<euro> 13,000, and the cost per saved life was <euro> 60,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention of dual dispatch defibrillation by ambulance and 
fire services in the County of Stockholm had positive economic effects. For the 
cost-benefit analysis, the return on investment was high and the 
cost-effectiveness showed levels below the threshold value for economic 
efficiency used in Sweden. The cost-utility analysis categorises the cost per 
QALY as medium.

multi-marker diabetes risk score.

BACKGROUND: Personalized medicine requires diagnostic tests that stratify 
patients into distinct groups that may differentially benefit from targeted 
treatment approaches. This study compared the costs and benefits of two 
approaches for identifying those at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes for 
entry into a diabetes prevention program. The first approach identified high 
risk patients using impaired fasting glucose (IFG). The second approach used the 
PreDx Diabetes Risk Score (DRS) to further stratify IFG patients into high-risk 
and moderate-risk groups.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the incidence and disease 
progression of diabetes and consequent costs and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALY), comparing alternative approaches for identifying high-risk 
patients. We modeled direct medical costs, including the costs of the 
stratification testing, over a 10-year time horizon from a US payer perspective.
RESULTS: Stratification of IFG patients by the DRS method leads to improved 
identification and prevention among those at highest risk. At 5 years, the 
number needed to treat (NNT) in the IFG-only approach was 39 patients to prevent 
one case of diabetes compared to an NNT of 15 in the IFG + DRS approach. When 
compared to IFG alone, the IFG + DRS approach results in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $17,100/QALY gained at 5 years and would 
become cost saving in 10 years. In contrast and as compared to no 
stratification, the IFG-only approach would produce an ICER of $235,500/QALY 
gained at 5 years and $94,600/QALY gained at 10 years. The study findings are 
limited by the generalizability of the DRS validation study and uncertainty 
regarding the long-term effectiveness of diabetes prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that the cost-effectiveness of diabetes 
prevention can be improved by better identification of patients at highest risk 
for diabetes using the DRS.

CONTEXT: Mortality rates among individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar 
disorder are elevated compared to the general population.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate life-expectancy (average age at death) 
among these persons and make a comparison to people in the general population.
METHODS: Life-expectancy was calculated by means of survival analysis techniques 
using the entire Danish population as a cohort.
RESULTS: Life-expectancy was 18.7 years shorter for schizophrenic men compared 
to men in the general population. Corresponding numbers for schizophrenic women 
was 16.3 years, for bipolar men 13.6 years, and for bipolar women 12.1 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Life-expectancy was much shorter in persons with schizophrenia or 
bipolar disorder. Excess mortality from physical diseases and medical conditions 
exerts a far greater influence on the curtailed life-expectancy, when compared 
against the impact of death by external causes.

BACKGROUND: Dignity therapy is a unique, individualised, short-term 
psychotherapy that was developed for patients (and their families) living with 
life-threatening or life-limiting illness. We investigated whether dignity 
therapy could mitigate distress or bolster the experience in patients nearing 
the end of their lives.
METHODS: Patients (aged ≥18 years) with a terminal prognosis (life expectancy ≤6 
months) who were receiving palliative care in a hospital or community setting 
(hospice or home) in Canada, USA, and Australia were randomly assigned to 
dignity therapy, client-centred care, or standard palliative care in a 1:1:1 
ratio. Randomisation was by use of a computer-generated table of random numbers 
in blocks of 30. Allocation concealment was by use of opaque sealed envelopes. 
The primary outcomes--reductions in various dimensions of distress before and 
after completion of the study--were measured with the Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well-Being Scale, Patient Dignity Inventory, 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, items from the Structured Interview for 
Symptoms and Concerns, Quality of Life Scale, and modified Edmonton Symptom 
Assessment Scale. Secondary outcomes of self-reported end-of-life experiences 
were assessed in a survey that was undertaken after the completion of the study. 
Outcomes were assessed by research staff with whom the participant had no 
previous contact to avoid any possible response bias or contamination. Analyses 
were done on all patients with available data at baseline and at the end of the 
study intervention. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00133965.
FINDINGS: 165 of 441 patients were assigned to dignity therapy, 140 standard 
palliative care, and 136 client-centred care. 108, 111, and 107 patients, 
respectively, were analysed. No significant differences were noted in the 
distress levels before and after completion of the study in the three groups. 
For the secondary outcomes, patients reported that dignity therapy was 
significantly more likely than the other two interventions to have been helpful 
(χ(2)=35·50, df=2; p<0·0001), improve quality of life (χ(2)=14·52; p=0·001), 
increase sense of dignity (χ(2)=12·66; p=0·002), change how their family saw and 
appreciated them (χ(2)=33·81; p<0·0001), and be helpful to their family 
(χ(2)=33·86; p<0·0001). Dignity therapy was significantly better than 
client-centred care in improving spiritual wellbeing (χ(2)=10·35; p=0·006), and 
was significantly better than standard palliative care in terms of lessening 
sadness or depression (χ(2)=9·38; p=0·009); significantly more patients who had 
received dignity therapy reported that the study group had been satisfactory, 
compared with those who received standard palliative care (χ(2)=29·58; 
p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: Although the ability of dignity therapy to mitigate outright 
distress, such as depression, desire for death or suicidality, has yet to be 
proven, its benefits in terms of self-reported end-of-life experiences support 
its clinical application for patients nearing death.

Endoscopy for upper GI cancer screening in the general population: a 
cost-utility analysis.

City, Kansas, USA.

BACKGROUND: Colon cancer screening with colonoscopy is an accepted strategy; 
however, there are limited data regarding the cost-effectiveness of screening 
for upper GI cancers (esophageal adenocarcinoma with its premalignant precursor 
Barrett's esophagus, esophageal squamous cell cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma) in 
the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening the general 
population for upper GI cancers by performing an upper endoscopy at the time of 
screening colonoscopy.
DESIGN: Decision analysis.
SETTING: Third-party-payer perspective with a time horizon of 30 years or until 
death.
PATIENTS: This study involved 50-year-old patients already undergoing screening 
colonoscopy.
INTERVENTION: Comparison of two strategies: performing and not performing a 
screening upper endoscopy at the time of screening colonoscopy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: One-time screening for the general population at the age of 50 for 
upper GI cancers required $115,664 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
compared with no screening or surveillance. A strategy of screening and 
surveillance for Barrett's esophagus required only $95,559 per QALY saved. In 
1-way sensitivity analyses, the prevalence rates of esophageal adenocarcinoma, 
esophageal squamous cell cancer, or gastric adenocarcinoma would have to 
increase by 654%, 1948%, and 337%, respectively, to generate an ICER of less 
than $50,000 per QALY.
LIMITATIONS: Omission of premalignant conditions for squamous cell cancer and 
gastric adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSION: The ICER for screening the general population for upper GI cancers 
with endoscopy remains high, despite accounting for reduced endoscopy costs and 
the combined benefits of detecting early esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal 
squamous cell cancer, and gastric adenocarcinoma. However, the ICER compares 
favorably with commonly performed screening strategies for other cancers.

BACKGROUND: The risk of recurrence following surgery in women with early breast 
cancer varies, depending upon prognostic factors. Adjuvant chemotherapy reduces 
this risk; however, increasingly effective regimens are associated with higher 
costs and toxicity profiles, making it likely that different regimens may be 
cost-effective for women with differing prognoses. To investigate this we 
performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of four treatment strategies: (1) no 
chemotherapy, (2) chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 
fluorouracil (CMF) (a first generation regimen), (3) chemotherapy using 
Epirubicin-CMF (E-CMF) or fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC60) 
(a second generation regimens), and (4) chemotherapy with FEC60 followed by 
docetaxel (FEC-D) (a third generation regimen). These adjuvant chemotherapy 
regimens were used in three large UK-led randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the natural progression of early 
breast cancer and the impact of chemotherapy on modifying this process. The 
probability of a first recurrent event within the model was estimated for women 
with different prognostic risk profiles using a parametric regression-based 
survival model incorporating established prognostic factors. Other 
probabilities, treatment effects, costs and quality of life weights were 
estimated primarily using data from the three UK-led RCTs, a meta-analysis of 
all relevant RCTs, and other published literature. The model predicted the 
lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of 
the four strategies for women with differing prognoses. Sensitivity analyses 
investigated the impact of uncertain parameters and model assumptions.
FINDINGS: For women with an average to high risk of recurrence (based upon 
prognostic factors and any other adjuvant therapies received), FEC-D appeared 
most cost-effective assuming a threshold of £20,000 per QALY for the National 
Health Service (NHS). For younger low risk women, E-CMF/FEC60 tended to be the 
optimal strategy and, for some older low risk women, the model suggested a 
policy of no chemotherapy was cost-effective. For no patient group was CMF 
chemotherapy the preferred option. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated 
cost-effectiveness results to be particularly sensitive to the treatment effect 
estimate for FEC-D and the future price of docetaxel.
INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this analysis is the first cost-effectiveness 
comparison of no chemotherapy, and first, second, and third generation adjuvant 
chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer patients with differing prognoses. 
The results demonstrate the potential for different treatment strategies to be 
cost-effective for different types of patients. These findings may prove useful 
for policy makers attempting to formulate cost-effective treatment guidelines in 
the field of early breast cancer.

Life-extending dietary restriction and ovariectomy result in similar feeding 
rates but different physiologic responses in grasshoppers.

Dietary restriction (DR) and reduced reproduction each extend life span in many 
species. Females undergoing DR typically experience a reduction in their 
fecundity, which raises the question of whether the two treatments are actually 
extending life span in overlapping ways. Life span in lubber grasshoppers has 
been shown to be increased by DR, and separately by ovariectomy (OVX). Here, we 
test the combination of these on life span. If life extension by the two 
treatments are additive, it would suggest that they likely act through separate 
pathways. The experimental groups were: fully reproductive and fully fed 
(ShamFD); ovariectomized and fully fed (OVXFD); fully reproductive and 
restricted diet (ShamDR); and ovariectomized and restricted diet (OVXDR). The 
median life spans of these groups were: ShamFD=245 d, OVXFD=285 d, ShamDR=286 d, 
and OVXDR=322 d. Feeding rate for the OVXFD group was 64% of ad libitum, similar 
to the 70% of ad libitum that was used for ShamDR. We also measured hemolymph 
parameters of physiology in these same individuals. Hemolymph levels of 
vitellogenin (the egg yolk-precursor protein) were increased 5-fold by OVX, but 
were not affected by DR. In addition, hemolymph total anti-oxidant activity (per 
μg protein) was significantly reduced by OVX, but was not affected by DR. We 
show that OVX and DR produce different physiological responses in grasshoppers, 
despite life extensions and feeding levels that were not significantly 
different. These data suggest that OVX and DR might extend life span via 
distinct pathways.

Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are facultative hibernators with a 
life expectancy of approximately 2 years. Previous investigations showed a 
hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein during hibernation and aging and raised 
hopes that Syrian hamsters might represent a useful animal model to study 
pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. Brain and spinal cord 
transversal sections of 190 hamsters 1-36 months of age were investigated using 
histology and immunohistochemistry to detect neurofibrillary tangles and/or 
diffuse as well as neuritic plaques. Summarized, amyloid deposition, 
neurofibrillary tangles, and diffuse as well as neuritic plaques were absent 
indicating that the Syrian golden hamster does not develop changes 
characteristic of Alzheimer's disease even at advanced age and does not 
represent an appropriate animal model for this disease.

The translational science of Marfan syndrome.

Marfan syndrome has changed over the last few years: new diagnostic criteria 
have been proposed, new clinical entities recognised and life expectancy 
increased. The role of fibrillin 1, which was initially thought to be mainly 
structural, has been shown to also be functional. The altered transforming 
growth factor β pathway is better understood, the importance of epigenetic 
factors has been demonstrated and recent data suggest that many of the 
observations made in Marfan syndrome can actually be made in thoracic aortic 
aneurysm from diverse aetiologies. Besides transforming growth factor β, the 
role of metalloproteinase, the fibrinolytic/coagulation system, is being 
suggested in the progression of the disease. A relationship between the type of 
fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene mutation and the mechanism for the disease 
(haplo-insufficiency vs negative dominance), as well as some genotype/phenotype 
correlations, has been observed, although the main challenge of recognising gene 
modifiers has yet to explain tremendous variability despite similar mutation. 
This progress has led to new hopes for tomorrow's therapies, some of which are 
being tested in clinics, whereas others are still in the field of animal models. 
Here we review some of the new data obtained in the understanding of the 
pathophysiology and genetics of this disease.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is caused by infection with human papillomavirus 
(HPV). Several countries have implemented vaccination programs against HPV for 
teenage girls before sexual debut. However, recent clinical trials have 
demonstrated that vaccination of older women is highly effective as well. 
Accordingly, it has been suggested that these older women should also be offered 
vaccination. Here, the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination for older women was 
assessed.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate age-specific health benefits and 
cost savings of HPV vaccination for women 12-50 years of age, in the 
Netherlands. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the 
outcomes. State-of-the-art health-economic methods were used, and international 
health-economic guidelines were followed.
RESULTS: HPV vaccination is highly cost-effective for girls aged 12-16 years. 
Remarkably, cost-effectiveness only slowly declines with increasing age of the 
vaccinees up to 25 years. Indeed, substantial health benefits can be obtained by 
vaccinating women in this age group at acceptable costs. Beyond this age, 
cost-effectiveness of HPV-vaccination rapidly declines.
CONCLUSIONS: Not only HPV vaccination of girls before sexual debut is a highly 
effective and cost-effective strategy for prevention of cervical cancer, but 
also vaccination of women until the age of 25 years is generally cost-effective.

Recent concepts in the management of extracranial carotid stenosis: carotid 
endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting.

Pandian JD(1).

Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab, India. jeyarajpandian@hotmail.com

Carotid stenosis is seen in 10% of patients with ischemic stroke, and carotid 
endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are the two invasive 
treatments options available. Pooled analysis of the three largest randomized 
trials of CEA involving more than 3000 symptomatic patients estimated 30-day 
stroke and death rate at 7.1% after CEA. Some subgroups among the symptomatic 
patients appeared to have more benefit from CEA. These include patients aged 75 
years or more, patients with ulcerated plaques, and patients with recent 
transient ischemic attacks within 2 weeks of randomization. Selection of 
asymptomatic patients for carotid revascularization should be guided by an 
assessment of comorbid conditions, life expectancy, and other individual 
factors, and should include a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of 
the procedure with an understanding of patient preferences. The recent trials 
comparing CEA with CAS has not established its superiority over CEA. The carotid 
revascularization endarterectomy versus stenting (CREST) study showed that CAS 
is still associated with a higher periprocedural risk of stroke or death than 
CEA. In patients over 70 years of age, CEA is clearly superior to CAS. The 
increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction in the CREST group subjected to 
CEA clearly suggests that patients being considered for CEA or CAS require a 
careful preliminary cardiac evaluation. CAS can be justified for patients whose 
medical comorbidities or cervical anatomy make them questionable candidates for 
CEA. The benefit of revascularization by either method versus modern aggressive 
medical therapy has not been established for patients with asymptomatic carotid 
stenosis.

PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the impact of minimally invasive 
surgery (MIS) for the treatment of patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord 
compression (MESCC) and vertebral body fracture, in terms of feasibility, 
clinical improvement, and morbidity.
METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients with diagnosis of MESCC from solid 
primary tumors were treated between January 2008 and June 2010 at our 
institution. All patients, after multidisciplinary assessment, were considered 
with poor prognosis because of their disease's extension and/or other clinical 
conditions. Mini-invasive percutaneous surgery was performed in all patients 
followed by radiotherapy within 2 weeks postoperatively. Clinical outcome was 
evaluated by modified visual analog scale for pain, Frankel Scale for neurologic 
deficit, and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan.
RESULTS: Clinical remission of pain was obtained in the vast majority of 
patients (96%). Improvement of neurological deficit was observed in 22 patients 
(88%). No major morbidity or perioperative mortality occurred. The average 
hospital stay was 6 days. Local recurrence occurred in two patients (8%). Median 
survival was 10 (range, 6-24) months. Overall survival at 1 year was 43%.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with MESCC and body fracture, with limited life 
expectancy, minimally invasive spinal surgery followed by radiotherapy, is 
feasible and provides clinical benefit in most of patients, with low morbidity. 
We believe that a minimally invasive approach can be an alternative surgical 
method compared with more aggressive or demanding procedures, which in selected 
patients with metastatic spinal cord compression with poor prognosis could 
represent overtreatment.

The rheological properties of blood and the risk of cardiovascular disease in 
patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important public health concern, which 
affects around 2-4% of the population. Left untreated, it causes a decrease not 
only in quality of life, but also of life expectancy. Despite the fact that 
knowledge about the mechanisms of development of cardiovascular disease in 
patients with OSA is still incomplete, observations confirm a relationship 
between sleep disordered breathing and the rheological properties of blood. One 
possible consequence of an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease may be 
a rise in mortality in OSA patients. Continuously improved research methods are 
allowing for an increasingly more accurate understanding of the significance of 
observed changes.

status. However, published reports on the cost effectiveness of this therapeutic 
approach are extremely rare.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of 
cetuximab combined with radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in 
patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
METHODS: A decision-tree analysis was used to compare cetuximab combined with 
radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with locally 
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck from the perspective of 
the national health payer (the Bureau of National Health Insurance [BNHI]) in 
Taiwan. The model was based on individual patient data extracted from an 
international phase III trial. The direct medical costs of care were estimated 
by clinical expert panels based on the reimbursement price of the BNHI (2007 
values). One-way sensitivity analyses were performed while varying the costs and 
clinical parameters.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for patients 
receiving radiotherapy in combination with cetuximab compared with radiotherapy 
alone was $US36 992/QALY in the base-case analysis (2007 values). The 
sensitivity analysis showed the highest net benefit for radiotherapy alone if 
the cost of cetuximab increased by 50%.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the addition of cetuximab to high-dose 
radiotherapy regimens is likely to be cost effective in Taiwan because the 
incremental cost per QALY is below the commonly accepted cost-effectiveness 
threshold.

An intervention to increase walking has previously been developed, consisting of 
three motivational techniques, designed to increase self-efficacy, and three 
volitional techniques, designed to help translate intentions into action. 
Previous research found large effects (d = 0.90) on the objectively measured 
walking behaviour of 130 English adult volunteers, mediated by self-efficacy. 
The present study aimed to replicate this intervention, and decompose the 
intervention to assess whether both motivational and volitional intervention 
components are necessary. A three-group experimental design was employed, with 
n = 35 adult volunteers randomly allocated to receive one of three 
interventions: (a) a "combined" intervention, containing motivational and 
volitional components in session at T1 and a filler task at T2, (b) a 
"motivation first" intervention, where the motivational components were received 
at T1 and the volitional components at T2, or (c) a "volition first" 
intervention, where the volitional components were received at T1 followed by 
motivational components at T2. At T2, there was a significant main effect of 
time, such that there was an increase in walking, but this did not differ 
between groups. At T3, the "combined" intervention group showed a large 
(d = 1.06) and significant (p = 0.036) increase in walking behaviour, in 
contrast to both other interventions (time × groups interaction, p = 0.003). The 
"combined" intervention also produced a significant increase in self-efficacy, 
relative to the two other interventions. This study demonstrates 
generalisability of previous large intervention effects and suggests that use of 
both motivational and volitional components is optimal in producing change in 
walking behaviour. Future research should explore the mechanisms by which 
techniques to increase self-efficacy and planning interact.

Hospital, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 91240 Israel. michaelwil@hadassah.org.il

INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal monogenic disorder. 
Life expectancy is rising towards a mean of 40 years, with advances in all 
aspects of therapy apart from treating the basic defect. Since the discovery of 
the gene that causes CF, our knowledge of how mutations in this gene cause the 
varied pathophysiological manifestations of this disease has increased 
substantially.
AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses the complexities of treatment in CF and the 
development of therapeutic approaches aimed at the different classes of basic 
mutation. Apart from gene therapy, several novel compounds have recently been 
discovered using high-throughput screening, which appear promising enough to 
develop effective drugs to cure the basic defect. This paper summarizes our 
current knowledge of gene and mutation-specific therapy and focuses on orally 
bioavailable potentiators and correctors, particularly suppressors of premature 
termination codons, including preclinical model systems and clinical trials in 
CF.
EXPERT OPINION: The further development of these drugs will enable treatment of 
the basic defect in diseases such as CF, and open the door for treatment of 
disease according to gene sequencing: true personalized medicine.

of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. william.wong@theta.utoronto.ca

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection among the 
immigrants of North America ranges from 2 to 15%, among whom 40% develop 
advanced liver disease. Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen is not 
recommended for immigrants.
AIMS: The objective of this study is to estimate the health and economic effects 
of screening strategies for CHB among immigrants.
METHODS: We used the Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of three 
screening strategies: (i) 'No screening'; (ii) 'Screen and Treat' and (iii) 
'Screen, Treat and Vaccinate' for 20-65 years old individuals who were born 
abroad but are currently living in Canada. Model data were obtained from the 
published literature. We measured predicted hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related 
deaths, costs (2008 Canadian Dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Our results show that screening all immigrants will prevent 59 
HBV-related deaths per 10, 000 persons screened over the lifetime of the cohort. 
Screening was associated with an increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(0.024 QALYs) and cost ($1665) per person with an ICER of $69, 209/QALY gained 
compared with 'No screening'. The 'Screen, Treat and Vaccinate' costs an 
additional $81, generates an additional 0.000022 QALYs per person, with an ICER 
of $3, 648,123/QALY compared with the 'Screen and Treat'. Sensitivity analyses 
suggested that the 'Screen and Treat' is likely to be moderately cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: We show that a selective hepatitis B screening programme targeted at 
all immigrants in Canada is likely to be moderately cost-effective. 
Identification of silent CHB infection with the offer of treatment when 
appropriate can extend the lives of immigrants at reasonable cost.

Medical University, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the effects of smoking and smoking cessation on life 
expectancy and active life expectancy among persons aged 55 years or older in 
Beijing.
METHODS: This study included 1593 men and 1664 women who participated in the 
Beijing Longitudinal Study of Aging, which commenced in 1992 and had 4 survey 
waves up to year 2000. An abridged life table was used to estimate life 
expectancy, in which age-specific mortality and age-specific disability rates 
were adjusted by using a discrete-time hazard model to control confounders.
RESULTS: The mean ages (SD) for men and women were 70.1 (9.25) and 70.2 (8.72) 
years, respectively; mortality and disability rates during follow-up were 34.7% 
and 8.0%, respectively. In both sexes, never smokers had the highest life 
expectancy and active life expectancy across ages, as compared with current and 
former smokers. Current heavy smokers had a shorter life expectancy and a 
shorter active life expectancy than light smokers. Among former smokers, male 
long-term quitters had a longer life expectancy and longer active life 
expectancy than short-term quitters, but this was not the case in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults remain at higher risk of mortality and morbidity from 
smoking and can expect to live a longer and healthier life after smoking 
cessation.

Role of endovascular intervention in patients with diabetic foot ulcer and 
concomitant peripheral arterial disease.

Claesson K(1), Kölbel T, Acosta S.

(1)Vascular Center, Malmö University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate wound healing, major amputation and 
mortality in patients with diabetic foot ulcer and peripheral arterial disease 
(PAD), and to compare the group decided to have an endovascular intervention 
with groups referred to conservative treatment or to those judged as 
unreconstructable.
METHODS: A retrospective two-year review of all patients with diabetic foot 
ulcers and PAD presented at an interdisciplinary diabetic foot round 2006-2007 
at Malmö University Hospital, Sweden, was performed. Independent predictive 
factors of insufficient ulcer healing, amputation and mortality during follow-up 
were analysed according to treatment decisions at the diabetic foot round.
RESULTS: A total of 135 limbs in 115 consecutive diabetic patients with foot 
ulcers were included. Median age was 73 years and 41% were women. During a 
median follow-up time of 17 months, 44% of the ulcers did not heal, 15% of the 
limbs underwent major amputation and 42% died. Ulcer depth with a Wagner grade 
≥3 (hazard ratio [HR] 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-12.9), CRP (HR 
1.007; 95% CI 1.002-1.012, and impaired run-off (HR 3.0; 95% CI 1.03-8.9) were 
independent risk factors for incomplete wound healing. The three treatment 
decision groups: attempt for endovascular leg revascularization (N.=75), 
conservative (N.=42) and unreconstructable (N.=18) showed no significant 
difference in terms of wound healing, major amputation or death.
CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetic foot ulcers and concomitant PAD are at high 
risk for limb loss and premature death. Ulcer depth, CRP and impaired run-off 
are independent risk factors for incomplete wound healing. There is an apparent 
need for prospective controlled studies to better define the role of 
endovascular therapy in this subset of diabetic foot ulcer patients.

Rudolf-Buchheim-Strasse 7, 35385, Giessen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Urogenital infections and inflammation are a significant etiologic 
factor in male infertility.
METHODS: Data for this review were acquired by a systematic search of the 
medical literature. Relevant cross-references were also taken into account.
RESULTS: We address infectious and inflammatory diseases of different 
compartments of the male genital tract and discuss their andrological sequelae. 
Chronic urethritis might be responsible for silent genital tract inflammation 
with negative impact on semen quality. In chronic pelvic pain syndrome, 
morphological abnormalities of spermatozoa and seminal plasma alterations are 
detectable. In the majority of men with epididymitis, a transient impairment of 
semen quality can be found during the acute infection. However, persistent 
detrimental effects are not uncommon, even after complete bacteriological cure. 
The relevance of chronic viral infections as an etiologic factor in male 
infertility is believed to be underestimated. Data concerning the impact of HIV 
infection on male fertility are of increasing interest as with the improvement 
in life expectancy, issues of sexuality and procreation gain importance. 
Moreover, effects of noninfectious systemic inflammation on the male 
reproductive tract have to be considered in patients with metabolic syndrome, a 
disorder of growing relevance worldwide. Finally, microbiological and related 
diagnostic findings in urine and semen samples are reviewed according to their 
relevance for male infertility.
CONCLUSIONS: Available data provide sufficient evidence that in men with 
alterations of the ejaculate, urogenital infections and inflammation have to be 
considered.

Optimal timing of joint replacement using mathematical programming and 
stochastic programming models.

Engineering, Bialik/Basel Sts., Beer Sheva 84100, Israel. baruchke@sce.ac.il

The optimal timing for performing radical medical procedures as joint (e.g., 
hip) replacement must be seriously considered. In this paper we show that under 
deterministic assumptions the optimal timing for joint replacement is a solution 
of a mathematical programming problem, and under stochastic assumptions the 
optimal timing can be formulated as a stochastic programming problem. We 
formulate deterministic and stochastic models that can serve as decision support 
tools. The results show that the benefit from joint replacement surgery is 
heavily dependent on timing. Moreover, for a special case where the patient's 
remaining life is normally distributed along with a normally distributed 
survival of the new joint, the expected benefit function from surgery is 
completely solved. This enables practitioners to draw the expected benefit 
graph, to find the optimal timing, to evaluate the benefit for each patient, to 
set priorities among patients and to decide if joint replacement should be 
performed and when.

Prescribing for older adults.

Boparai MK(1), Korc-Grodzicki B.

Author information:
(1)Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.

Pharmacotherapy of the elderly is very complex due to age-related physiologic 
changes, multiple comorbidities, multiple medications (prescription, over-the 
counter, and herbal), and multiple providers (prescribers and pharmacies). 
Age-related physiologic changes and disease-related changes in organ function 
affect drug handling (pharmacokinetics) and response (pharmacodynamics). In 
addition, patients' cognitive impairment, functional difficulties, as well as 
caregiver issues play a large role in errors and compliance. Many older adults 
have several chronic conditions, and they stand to benefit the most from best 
practice guidelines. However, they are also at risk of toxicity given our 
increasingly complex pharmacopoeia and potential adverse effects that can cause 
morbidity and mortality. It is imperative that physicians learn how to minimize 
side effects and interactions. Potentially inappropriate medications 
(medications that pose more risk than benefit to the patient) are among the most 
important causes of adverse drug reactions, independent of the number of 
medications and other confounding factors. Many of these adverse drug reactions 
could be predicted from the known pharmacology of the drug and therefore could 
be potentially avoidable. To prescribe appropriately, we need to consider not 
only the pharmacological properties of the drugs, but also clinical, 
epidemiological, social, cultural, and economic factors. Elders' adherence to 
prescribed medications is also complex and depends on medical, personal, and 
economic factors; cognitive status; and relationship with the physician. 
Detection of nonadherence is a necessary prerequisite for adequate treatment, 
and patient education is a cornerstone in achieving medication adherence. 
Finally, appropriate prescribing should include a consideration of life 
expectancy and goals of care.

A space for mothers: grief as identity construction on memorial websites created 
by SIDS parents.

Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. cfinlay@asc.upenn.edu

In this article we conduct a textual analysis of memorial websites created by 
mothers who have experienced a loss due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). 
Using an online Internet ethnographic approach, we reviewed a series of 20 sites 
in an attempt to analyze the motivations of the site creators as manifested in 
their online projects. We spent time on the sites, moving through all facets of 
them, following links, and experiencing them the way a visitor would encounter 
them. In this virtual exploration we uncovered personal narratives, community 
building, religious imagery, and numerous examples of social networking. We also 
analyzed guest books in order to understand who visits these sites and their 
reasons for doing so. We conclude that development of these sites are a process 
that helps some mothers in their grief and gives them a focus and activity that 
is helpful and perhaps healing. More importantly perhaps is the potential for 
community building and networking that this type of activity allows. As an 
extension of a real-world memorial such as a gravesite, a virtual mourning space 
provides more in the way of these types of communications. Our work suggests 
that memorial websites constructed by SIDS parents help in meaning and identity 
reconstruction after loss.

Identification of mutations that delay somatic or reproductive aging of 
Caenorhabditis elegans.

Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

Aging is an important feature of animal biology characterized by progressive, 
degenerative changes in somatic and reproductive tissues. The rate of 
age-related degeneration is genetically controlled, since genes that influence 
lifespan have been identified. However, little is known about genes that affect 
reproductive aging or aging of specific somatic tissues. To identify genes that 
are important for controlling these degenerative changes, we used chemical 
mutagenesis to perform forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans. By 
conducting a screen focused on somatic aging, we identified mutant 
hermaphrodites that displayed extended periods of pharyngeal pumping, body 
movement, or survival. One of these mutations is a novel allele of the age-1 
gene. age-1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) that functions in the 
insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway. age-1(am88) 
creates a missense change in the conserved PIK domain and causes dramatic 
extensions of the pharyngeal pumping and body movement spans, as well as a 
twofold extension of the lifespan. By conducting screens focused on reproductive 
aging in mated hermaphrodites, we identified mutants that displayed increased 
progeny production late in life. To characterize these mutations, we developed 
quantitative measurements of age-related morphological changes in the gonad. The 
am117 mutation delayed age-related declines in progeny production and 
morphological changes in the gonad. These studies provide new insights into the 
genetic regulation of age-related degenerative changes in somatic and 
reproductive tissues.

Baculoviral expression of telomerase in primary human fibroblasts to rejuvenate 
cells for tissue engineering.

Gamble CM(1), Barton PA.

Melbourne, Australia.

Tissue engineering involves the use of synthetic or natural materials as a 
scaffold to support the growth of replacement tissue or organs. The use of 
autologous cells to populate the scaffold avoids problems associated with 
rejection; however, a major limitation of this approach is the finite lifespan 
of primary cells in culture. This finite lifespan is due to the shortening of 
telomeres, short repetitive sequences of DNA located at the ends of eukaryotic 
chromosomes. Ectopic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is 
able to reconstitute telomerase activity and maintain the length of telomeres. 
This study investigated an alternative gene delivery vector, baculovirus, for 
the expression of hTERT in primary human cells. A recombinant baculovirus was 
used to efficiently deliver the hTERT gene to primary fibroblasts and the 
telomerase enzyme was found to be active. Although no increase in telomere 
length was detected, expression of hTERT in primary fibroblasts resulted in a 
significant extension of replicative lifespan. To our knowledge this is a novel 
attempt to use a recombinant baculovirus for the extension of cellular lifespan 
by exogenous expression of telomerase.
