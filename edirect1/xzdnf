BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown treatment benefits of dupilumab in 
patients with uncontrolled asthma for up to 1 year. This study aimed to evaluate 
the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients with 
moderate-to-severe asthma, as data for extended treatment with dupilumab beyond 
1 year are not available.
METHODS: TRAVERSE was an open-label extension study in 362 hospitals and 
clinical centres across 27 countries that assessed the safety and efficacy of 
dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks up to 96 weeks in adults and adolescents (aged 
12-84 years) with moderate-to-severe or oral-corticosteroid-dependent severe 
asthma who had completed a previous dupilumab asthma study (phase 2A EXPEDITION, 
phase 2B DRI [P2b], phase 3 QUEST, or VENTURE). The primary endpoint was the 
number and percentage of patients with any treatment-emergent adverse events. 
Secondary endpoints included annualised exacerbation rate (AER) over the 
treatment period and change from parent study baseline in pre-bronchodilator 
FEV1, the five-item asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5), the asthma quality of 
life questionnaire (AQLQ), type 2 biomarkers (blood eosinophils and serum total 
IgE), and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Statistical analyses were descriptive. We 
report safety in all enrolled patients, and efficacy in patients with 
non-oral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma and in subgroups, including patients 
with a type 2 inflammatory phenotype who received 148 weeks of treatment. This 
study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02134028.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 5, 2014, and Oct 11, 2019, of 2302 patients assessed for 
eligibility, 2282 adults and adolescents were enrolled (median age 50 years, 
62·1% female and 37·9% male). Safety during TRAVERSE was consistent with the 
known dupilumab safety profile. The proportion of patients reporting 
treatment-emergent adverse events throughout the study duration was similar to 
that observed in the parent studies and ranged from 76·3% to 94·7%. The most 
frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were nasopharyngitis 
(17·5-25·9%), injection-site erythema (2·2-23·4%), and bronchitis (9·3-19·0%). 
Serious asthma exacerbations (0·5-3·6%) and pneumonia (0·7-2·7%) were the most 
frequently reported serious adverse events. There were four treatment-emergent 
adverse events leading to death. Efficacy during TRAVERSE was also consistent 
with the results of parent studies. In patients who were 
non-oral-corticosteroid-dependent, AER remained low (0·277-0·327) across parent 
study and treatment groups, pre-bronchodilator FEV1 improvements were sustained 
to the end of treatment at week 96 (mean changes from parent study baseline 
ranged from 0·22 L [SD 0·44] to 0·33 L [0·44] across parent study and treatment 
groups), and improvements in ACQ-5 and AQLQ scores were sustained to the last 
timepoint assessed at week 48. Rapid improvements were observed in 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1 and sustained improvements were seen in all outcome 
measures for patients given dupilumab who previously received placebo in parent 
studies; further improvements in AER, asthma control, and health-related quality 
of life were observed in patients who continued receiving dupilumab. Blood 
eosinophils and serum total IgE decreased progressively. ADA status had no 
effect on safety or efficacy. In the subgroup of patients with a type 2 
inflammatory phenotype followed-up for 148 weeks, AER decreased progressively, 
and initial lung function improvements were sustained over 148 weeks.
INTERPRETATION: Data show that safety and efficacy of dupilumab in adult and 
adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe asthma are sustained when treatment 
is extended up to 148 weeks. These findings therefore support the long-term use 
of dupilumab in this patient population.

Docetaxel could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by targeting 
microtubules. The extension of cellular microtubules plays an important role in 
the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. This paper aims to study the 
distribution and mechanical properties of cytoskeletal proteins with low 
concentration of docetaxel. MTT assay was used to detect the minimum drug 
activity concentration of docetaxel on SKOV-3 cells, fluorescence staining was 
used to analyze the distribution of cytoskeleton proteins, scanning electron 
microscopy(SEM) was used to observe the morphology of single cells, and atomic 
force microscopy(AFM) was used to determine the microstructure and mechanical 
properties of cells. The results showed that the IC10 of docetaxel was 1 ng/ml. 
Docetaxel can effectively inhibit the formation of cell pseudopodia, hinder the 
indirectness between cells, reduce the cell extension area, and make the cells 
malformed. In addition, when AFM analyzes the effects of drugs on cell 
microstructure and mechanical properties, the average cell surface roughness and 
cell height are positively correlated with the concentration of docetaxel. 
Especially when the concentration was 100 ng/ml, the adhesion decreased by 
37.04% and Young's modulus increased by 1.57 times compared with the control 
group. This may be because docetaxel leads to microtubule remodeling and 
membrane protein aggregation, which affects cell microstructure and increases 
cell strength, leading to significant changes in the mechanical properties of 
ovarian cells. This is of great significance to the study of the formation 
mechanism of tumor cell invasion and migration activities mediated by actin.

The pattern of metastases in prostate cancer (PC) is evolving. Increased use of 
imaging, newer imaging techniques with higher sensitivity for disease detection 
and patients receiving multiple lines of novel therapies with increased life 
expectancy are likely to be contributory. Awareness of metastatic disease 
patterns improves early diagnosis, accurate staging, and initiation of 
appropriate therapy, and can inform prognostic information and anticipate 
potential disease complications. The aim of this review is to document the 
spectrum of metastases in PC including emerging and unusual patterns, and to 
highlight the role of novel imaging including prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA)-positron-emission tomography (PET) and whole-body magnetic resonance 
imaging (WB-MRI) to improve diagnostic and response assessment accuracy.

BACKGROUND-AIM: Intravenously administered biologicals are associated with a 
huge pressure to Infusion Units and increased cost. We aimed to assess the 
impact of switching infliximab to golimumab in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients 
in deep remission. Patients and method: In a prospective, single-centre pilot 
study UC patients on infliximab mono-therapy for = 2 years, whowere in deep 
remission, consented to switch to golimumab and were followed for 1 year with 
clinical assessment, serum and faecal biomarkers, work productivity, 
satisfaction with treatment and quality of life parameters. Endoscopic remission 
was assessed by colonoscopy at 1 year. Patients fulfilling the same inclusion 
criteria, who did not consent to switch to golimumab and continued to receive 
infliximab mono-therapy, for the same period, served as controls.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective, single-centre pilot study UC patients on 
infliximab mono-therapy for ≥ 2 years, who were in deep remission, consented to 
switch to golimumab and were followed for 1 year with clinical assessment, serum 
and faecal biomarkers, work productivity, satisfaction with treatment and 
quality of life parameters. Endoscopic remission was assessed by colonoscopy at 
1 year. Patients fulfilling the same inclusion criteria, who did not consent to 
switch to golimumab and continued to receive infliximab mono-therapy, for the 
same period, served as controls.
RESULTS: Between October 2015 and October 2017, 20 patients were recruited; 
however one patient stopped therapy because of pregnancy. All 19 patients who 
were switched to golimumab were still in clinical, biomarker and endoscopic 
remission at 1 year and maintained excellent quality of life without any 
complications. In the control group, 18 of 19 patients were also in deep 
remission, since only one patient had a flare which was managed with IFX dose 
intensification. During a median 3 years extension treatment with golimumab only 
2 patients experienced a flare of colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study indicates that switching from in-fliximab to 
golimumab in UC patients in deep remission does not compromise treatment 
effectiveness or the course of disease; golimumab offers a valid alternative to 
intravenous infliximab infusions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After admixture, recombination breaks down genomic blocks of contiguous 
ancestry. The breakdown of these blocks forms a new "molecular clock" that ticks 
at a much faster rate than the mutation clock, enabling accurate dating of 
admixture events in the recent past. However, existing theory on the breakdown 
of these blocks, or the accumulation of delineations between blocks, so-called 
"junctions", has mostly been limited to using regularly spaced markers on phased 
data. Here, we present an extension to the theory of junctions using the 
ancestral recombination graph that describes the expected number of junctions 
for any distribution of markers along the genome. Furthermore, we provide a new 
framework to infer the time since admixture using unphased data. We demonstrate 
both the phased and unphased methods on simulated data and show that our new 
extensions have improved accuracy with respect to previous methods, especially 
for smaller population sizes and more ancient admixture times. Lastly, we 
demonstrate the applicability of our method on three empirical data sets, 
including labcrosses of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae) and two case studies of 
hybridization in swordtail fish and Populus trees.

The consequence of the lockdowns implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic on 
human health damage due to air pollution and other environmental issues must be 
better understood. This paper analyses the effect of reducing energy demand on 
the evolution of environmental impacts during the occurrence of 2020-lockdown 
periods in Italy, with a specific focus on life expectancy. An energy metabolism 
analysis is conducted based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of all monthly 
energy consumptions, by sector, category and province area in Italy between 
January 2015 to December 2020. Results show a general decrease (by ∼5% on 
average) of the LCA midpoint impact categories (global warming, stratospheric 
ozone depletion, fine particulate matter formation, etc.) over the entire year 
2020 when compared to past years. These avoided impacts, mainly due to 
reductions in fossil energy consumptions, are meaningful during the first 
lockdown phase between March and May 2020 (by ∼21% on average). Regarding the 
LCA endpoint damage on human health, ∼66 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) 
per 100,000 inhabitants are estimated to be saved. The analysis shows that the 
magnitude of the officially recorded casualties is substantially larger than the 
estimated gains in human lives due to the environmental impact reductions. 
Future research could therefore investigate the complex cause-effect 
relationships between the deaths occurred in 2020 imputed to COVID-19 disease 
and co-factors other than the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

PURPOSE: To demonstrate the need for developing standardized healthcare 
transition plans for persons with severe forms of thalassemia as life expectancy 
continues to improve.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This study utilized an original questionnaire to explore the 
factors that determined whether individuals residing in North America 
transferred their thalassemia care from a pediatric to an adult specialist, and 
what components they believed should be included in a healthcare transition 
plan.
RESULTS: Approximately one-third of respondents remained under the care of a 
pediatric hematologist, most commonly citing the thalassemia knowledge of the 
specialist as their reason for not transferring their care. Additionally, this 
group also reported more thalassemia-related services available at their 
healthcare facility, better access to flexible hours for blood transfusions and 
increased satisfaction with their care. Adults with thalassemia recommend 
enhanced communication between patient and provider and building opportunities 
for patients to assume the role of self advocate as key components for a 
healthcare transition plan.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an inconsistency in the transfer-of-care experience of 
adults with severe forms of thalassemia living in North America. Development of 
a healthcare transition program would benefit from the input of those who have 
gone through this process.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: A well informed healthcare transition program can enhance 
the quality of life of those with thalassemia. The training and educational 
background of nurses and genetic counselors make them uniquely qualified to 
guide patients on how to advocate for themselves and to ensure continuity of 
care during a healthcare transition.

Breast cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent in the women greater than 
65 years of age. Most tumors are hormone receptor-positive in this group. Breast 
cancer screening recommendations for older women should be tailored based on 
life expectancy. Early stage breast cancer should be treated with conservative 
surgery followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy in HR+ patients. Primary 
endocrine therapy is a low-risk option for those with limited life expectancy. 
Adjuvant radiation therapy can be avoided in early stage, low-risk cancers. 
Evaluation should include comprehensive geriatric assessment. Treatment with 
less cytotoxic chemotherapy, HER-2 targeted therapies, and other 
biomarker-driven, molecularly targeted therapies should be sought whenever 
possible.

BACKGROUND: There is some interest in long-term survival after various cardiac 
surgical strategies, including off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery surgery 
(CAG), mitral valve (MV) repair versus replacement, and aortic valve (AV) 
bioprosthetic versus mechanical replacement.
METHODS: We studied patients older than 49 years of age, recording risk factors 
and surgical details at the time of surgery. We classified procedures as: MV 
surgery with or without concurrent grafts or valves; AV surgery with or without 
concurrent CAG; or isolated CAG. Follow-up was through the state death register 
and state-wide hospital attendance records. Risk-adjusted survival was estimated 
using Cox proportional hazards. Observed survival was compared to the expected 
age- and sex- matched population survival.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 14.8 years 5,807 of 11,718 patients died. 
The difference between observed and expected survival varied between 3.4 years 
for AV surgery and 9.6 years for females undergoing MV surgery. The 
risk-adjusted mortality hazard rate after off-pump CAG was 0.93 (95% CI 0.8-1.0, 
p=0.84), MV repair 0.67 (95% CI 0.6-0.8, p<0.0001), MV bioprosthesis 0.82 (95% 
CI 0.81 (0.6-1.0, p=0.11) and bioprosthetic AV replacement 1.02 (95% CI 0.9-1.2, 
p=0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the general population, cardiac surgical patients have 
a shorter than expected life expectancy. We observed a survival benefit of 
mitral valve repair over replacement. We did not observe significant survival 
differences between off-pump and on-pump CAG, nor between bioprosthetic and 
mechanical replacement.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with bipolar disorder have a reduced life expectancy and 
may experience accelerated biological ageing. In individuals with bipolar 
disorder and healthy controls, we examined differences in age-related changes in 
physiology.
METHODS: UK Biobank recruited more than 500,000 participants, aged 37-73, 
between 2006 and 2010. Generalised additive models were used to examine 
associations between age and grip strength, cardiovascular function, body 
composition, lung function and heel bone mineral density.
RESULTS: The main dataset included 271,118 adults (mean age = 56.04 years; 
49.60% females). We found statistically significant differences between cases 
and controls for grip strength, blood pressure, pulse rate and body composition, 
with standardised mean differences of up to -0.24 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.19). 
Evidence of differences in lung function, heel bone mineral density or arterial 
stiffness was limited. Case-control differences were most evident for 
age-related changes in cardiovascular function (both sexes) and body composition 
(females). Differences did not uniformly narrow or widen with age and differed 
by sex. For example, the difference in systolic blood pressure between male 
cases and controls was -1.3 mmHg at age 50 and widened to -4.7 mmHg at age 65. 
Diastolic blood pressure in female cases was 1.2 mmHg higher at age 40 and 
-1.2 mmHg lower at age 65.
LIMITATIONS: Analyses did not distinguish between bipolar disorder subtypes. 
Results may not generalise to other age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences between bipolar disorder cases and controls were most 
evident for cardiovascular and body composition measures. Targeted screening for 
cardiovascular and metabolic health in middle age is warranted to potentially 
mitigate excess mortality.

OBJECTIVE: Self-defining memories (SDMs) are units of life-story analysis, whose 
features resemble elements from narrative identity's factorial structure. To 
bridge narrative-identity and personality-trait domains, we conducted a 
replication and extension of prior research.
METHOD: We linked four SDM features - affect, specificity, meaning making, and 
content - to the Big Three trait domains of personality and psychopathology in a 
small sample that was well-powered for multilevel modeling (133 participants, 
1330 SDMs).
RESULTS: Affect SDM affect correlated with indices of Positive Emotionality and 
Negative Emotionality, and narrative themes of contamination were associated 
with Negative Emotionality. Specificity SDM specificity vs. overgenerality 
related to Constraint and Negative Emotionality indices, lending support to the 
executive dysfunction and emotional disorder theories of overgeneral 
autobiographical memory. (Tests of the avoidance thesis of overgeneral memory 
were inconclusive.) Meaning making Explicit meaning making in SDMs reflected 
adaptive personality. It moderated (or buffered) the link between SDMs' affect 
and chronic emotional distress. Content The links between SDM content and traits 
suggest that SDMs reflect personal goals, whose fulfillment or frustration 
relate to psychological health.
CONCLUSIONS: This research serves replication purposes as well as the purpose of 
connecting two major domains of personality: narrative identity and adaptive and 
maladaptive traits.

BACKGROUND: The primary progressive aphasias (PPA) represent a group of usually 
sporadic neurodegenerative disorders with three main variants: the nonfluent or 
agrammatic variant (nfvPPA), the semantic variant (svPPA), and the logopenic 
variant (lvPPA). They are usually associated with a specific underlying 
pathology: nfvPPA with a primary tauopathy, svPPA with a TDP-43 proteinopathy, 
and lvPPA with underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Little is known about their 
cause or pathophysiology, but prior studies in both AD and svPPA have suggested 
a role for neuroinflammation. In this study, we set out to investigate the role 
of chemokines across the PPA spectrum, with a primary focus on central changes 
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) METHODS: Thirty-six participants with sporadic PPA 
(11 svPPA, 13 nfvPPA, and 12 lvPPA) as well as 19 healthy controls were 
recruited to the study and donated CSF and plasma samples. All patients with 
lvPPA had a tau/Aβ42 biomarker profile consistent with AD, whilst this was 
normal in the other PPA groups and controls. We assessed twenty chemokines in 
CSF and plasma using Proximity Extension Assay technology: CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 
(MIP-1a), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL11 (eotaxin), CCL13 
(MCP-4), CCL19, CCL20, CCL23, CCL25, CCL28, CX3CL1 (fractalkine), CXCL1, CXCL5, 
CXCL6, CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11.
RESULTS: In CSF, CCL19 and CXCL6 were decreased in both svPPA and nfvPPA 
compared with controls whilst CXCL5 was decreased in the nfvPPA group with a 
borderline significant decrease in the svPPA group. In contrast, CCL2, CCL3 and 
CX3CL1 were increased in lvPPA compared with controls and nfvPPA (and greater 
than svPPA for CX3CL1). CXCL1 was also increased in lvPPA compared with nfvPPA 
but not the other groups. CX3CL1 was significantly correlated with CSF total tau 
concentrations in the controls and each of the PPA groups. Fewer significant 
differences were seen between groups in plasma, although in general, results 
were in the opposite direction to CSF, i.e. decreased in lvPPA compared with 
controls (CCL3 and CCL19), and increased in svPPA (CCL8) and nfvPPA (CCL13).
CONCLUSION: Differential alteration of chemokines across the PPA variants is 
seen in both CSF and plasma. Importantly, these results suggest a role for 
neuroinflammation in these poorly understood sporadic disorders, and therefore 
also a potential future therapeutic target.

Democracy is generally associated with governmental accountability, better 
public policy choices and public health. However, there is limited evidence 
about how political regime transition impacts public health. We use two samples 
of the states around the world to trace the impact of regime transition on 
public health: the first sample comprises 29 post-communist states, along with 
20 consolidated democracies, for the period of 1970-2014; the second sample is a 
subsample of the same 29 post-communist states but only for the period of 
transition, 1990-2014. We find that the post-communist states experienced some 
decline in life expectancy in the first few years of transition (1990-1995). 
Yet, with a steady increase in the measure of democracy from 1995 onwards, life 
expectancy significantly improved and infant mortality decreased. Therefore, in 
the long run, democratization has had a positive impact on both the life 
expectancy and infant mortality of citizens of the post-communist states.

Well-Being as Human Development, Equality, Happiness and the Role of Freedom, 
Activism, Decentralization, Volunteerism and Voter Participation: A Global 
Country-Level Study.

We propose and test a new model for predicting multiple quantitative measures of 
well-being globally at the country level based on the United Nations Human 
Development Index (HDI), income inequality (Net Gini), and National Happiness 
Index (NHI; U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network world survey of life 
satisfaction). HDI consists of per-capita Gross National Income (economic 
well-being), average life expectancy (proxy for health well-being), and 
educational attainment (capabilities well-being). Using data on 105 countries 
representing 95% of the world's population, a history of grassroots activism 
(Global Non-violent Action Database), civil liberties and political rights 
(Freedom Score), political and fiscal decentralization, and voter participation 
(Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance) correlate with HDI and NHI. 
Citizen volunteering (Gallup Civic Engagement Index) predicts only NHI. In 
multivariate analyses, Freedom Score is the most robust predictor of all 
well-being measures, including income equality. Fiscal decentralization and 
voter turnout also predict HDI and NHI, controlling for other influences. Based 
on prior analyses in the Global Development of Applied Community Studies 
project, implications and recommendations are discussed for developing community 
human research and professional resources across 12 disciplines in countries 
where they are needed based on social justice, citizenship, well-being, 
inequality, human rights, and other development challenges. We recommend 
individual and community-level and qualitative analyses of the above predictors' 
relationships with these same conceptualizations of well-being, as well as 
consideration of other social, cultural and political variables and their effect 
on well-being.

Gout is the most frequent form of inflammatory arthritis in the world. Its 
prevalence is particularly elevated in specific geographical areas such as in 
the Oceania/Pacific region and is rising in the US, Europe, and Asia. Gout is a 
severe and painful disease, in which co-morbidities are responsible for a 
significant reduction in life expectancy. However, gout patients remain 
ostracized because the disease is still considered "self-inflicted", as a result 
of unhealthy lifestyle and excessive food and alcohol intake. While the etiology 
of gout flares is clearly associated with the presence of monosodium urate (MSU) 
crystal deposits, several major questions remain unanswered, such as the 
relationships between diet, hyperuricemia and gout flares or the mechanisms by 
which urate induces inflammation. Recent advances have identified gene variants 
associated with gout incidence. Nevertheless, genetic origins of gout combined 
to diet-related possible uric acid overproduction account for the symptoms in 
only a minor portion of patients. Hence, additional factors must be at play. 
Here, we review the impact of epigenetic mechanisms in which nutrients (such as 
ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) and/or dietary-derived metabolites (like urate) 
trigger anti/pro-inflammatory responses that may participate in gout 
pathogenesis and severity. We propose that simple dietary regimens may be 
beneficial to complement therapeutic management or contribute to the prevention 
of flares in gout patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease in the United 
States, in which demyelination of the brain and spinal cord disrupts the 
transmission of signals throughout the body. With an average life expectancy of 
30 years from the start of the disease, treatment relies on symptom management 
through steroids and disease-modifying agents, as there is no cure. While MS 
patients have not been shown to be at increased risk for coronavirus disease 19 
(COVID-19) infection, prolonged hospitalizations and severe COVID-19 sequelae 
have been linked to various MS subgroups. Limited studies, however, have 
reported on the role of COVID-19 in precipitating MS exacerbations, as flare-ups 
often occur during times of stress or immunological insult. Here we present a 
45-year-old patient with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis whose 
neurological symptoms worsened sharply in the weeks following an inpatient 
admission for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Aim: We aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors attributable to 
ovarian cancer, and epidemiological trends at global, regional, and national 
levels. Methods: We described ovarian cancer data on incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years as well as age-standardized rates from 1990 to 
2017 from the Global Health Data Exchange database. We also estimated the risk 
factors attributable to ovarian cancer deaths and disability-adjusted 
life-years. Measures were stratified by region, country, age, and 
socio-demographic index. The estimated annual percentage changes and 
age-standardized rates were calculated to evaluate temporal trends. Results: 
Globally, ovarian cancer incident, death cases, and disability-adjusted 
life-years increased by 88.01, 84.20, and 78.00%, respectively. However, all the 
corresponding age-standardized rates showed downward trends with an estimated 
annual percentage change of -0.10 (-0.03 to 0.16), -0.33 (-0.38 to -0.27), and 
-0.38 (-0.32 to 0.25), respectively. South and East Asia and Western Europe 
carried the heaviest disease burden. The highest incidence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years were mainly in people aged 50-69 years from 1990 
to 2017. High fasting plasma glucose level was the greatest contributor in 
age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years rate globally as well as in all 
socio-demographic index quintiles and most Global Disease Burden regions. Other 
important factors were high body mass index and occupational exposure to 
asbestos. Conclusion: Our study provides valuable information on patterns and 
trends of disease burden and risk factors attributable to ovarian cancer across 
age, socio-demographic index, region, and country, which may help improve the 
rational allocation of health resources as well as inform health policies.

Sharing With Patients the Uncertainties Regarding the Management of Dyspepsia.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, Hebrew University - Hadassah Medical Center, 
Jerusalem, Israel.

Background: The management of patients with dyspepsia is uncertain. Some authors 
advocate endoscopy for all; others restrict endoscopy only to patients at high 
risk of gastric cancer, namely to those above an age threshold, or with a family 
history, dysphagia, loss of weight, anemia, or a childhood in Asian countries. 
Still others recommend various combinations between test-and-treat for 
Helicobacter pylori, anti-secretory treatment, and/or endoscopy. Objective: To 
highlight the uncertainties in the choice between the various strategies and 
argue that these uncertainties should be shared with the patient. Method: An 
overview of reported life expectancy, patient satisfaction, gastric cancer 
detection rates, symptom relief, and cost effectiveness of the management 
strategies for dyspepsia. Main Findings: There are no randomized controlled 
trials of the effect of screening by endoscopy on mortality of patients with 
gastric cancer. Lower grades of evidence suggest that early diagnosis reduces 
this mortality. Analyses, which assume a survival benefit of early diagnosis, 
indicate that mass screening in countries of high incidence gastric cancer (> 10 
cases per 100,000) and targeted screening of high-risk persons in countries of 
low-intermediate incidence (<10 cases per 100,000) is cost-effective at a 
willingness to pay of $20,000-50,000 per QALY. Prompt endoscopy appears to be 
best for patient satisfaction and gastric cancer detection, and test-and-treat 
for H pylori-for symptom relief and avoiding endoscopies. Conclusions: The gain 
in life expectancy is the main source of uncertainty in the choice between 
management strategies. This choice should be shared with the patients after 
explaining uncertainties and eliciting their preferences.

BACKGROUND: Multiple Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines appear to be 
safe and efficacious, but only high-income countries have the resources to 
procure sufficient vaccine doses for most of their eligible populations. The 
World Health Organization has published guidelines for vaccine prioritisation, 
but most vaccine impact projections have focused on high-income countries, and 
few incorporate economic considerations. To address this evidence gap, we 
projected the health and economic impact of different vaccination scenarios in 
Sindh Province, Pakistan (population: 48 million).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We fitted a compartmental transmission model to COVID-19 
cases and deaths in Sindh from 30 April to 15 September 2020. We then projected 
cases, deaths, and hospitalisation outcomes over 10 years under different 
vaccine scenarios. Finally, we combined these projections with a detailed 
economic model to estimate incremental costs (from healthcare and partial 
societal perspectives), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each scenario. We project that 1 year of 
vaccine distribution, at delivery rates consistent with COVAX projections, using 
an infection-blocking vaccine at $3/dose with 70% efficacy and 2.5-year duration 
of protection is likely to avert around 0.9 (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.9, 
1.0) million cases, 10.1 (95% CrI: 10.1, 10.3) thousand deaths, and 70.1 (95% 
CrI: 69.9, 70.6) thousand DALYs, with an ICER of $27.9 per DALY averted from the 
health system perspective. Under a broad range of alternative scenarios, we find 
that initially prioritising the older (65+) population generally prevents more 
deaths. However, unprioritised distribution has almost the same 
cost-effectiveness when considering all outcomes, and both prioritised and 
unprioritised programmes can be cost-effective for low per-dose costs. High 
vaccine prices ($10/dose), however, may not be cost-effective, depending on the
