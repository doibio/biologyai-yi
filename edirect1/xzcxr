(NCT01677910) informed telotristat ethyl efficacy; subsequently, health states 
were captured by a Markov model using 4-week cycles. TELESTAR open-label 
extension data informed telotristat ethyl discontinuation. The number of 
treatment-eligible patients was estimated from literature reviews reporting the 
prevalence, incidence and mortality of carcinoid syndrome. A Swedish database 
study informed real-world costs related to carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid 
heart disease costs. Telotristat ethyl market share was assumed to increase 
annually from 24% (year 1) to 70% (year 5).
RESULTS: Over the 5-year model horizon, 44 patients were expected to initiate 
telotristat ethyl treatment. The cumulative net budget impact of adding 
telotristat ethyl to current standard of care was €172,346; per-year costs 
decreased from €66,495 (year 1) to €29,818 (year 5). Increased drug costs from 
adding telotristat ethyl were offset by reduced costs elsewhere.
CONCLUSIONS: The expected budget impact of adding telotristat ethyl to the 
standard of care in Sweden was relatively low, largely because of the rarity of 
carcinoid syndrome.

BACKGROUND: A randomized phase III trial comparing whole-brain radiotherapy 
(WBRT) to observation following definitive local treatment of intracranial 
melanoma metastases with neurosurgery and/or stereotactic surgery (SRS) is 
underway.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the pre-trial cost-effectiveness of WBRT, 
hippocampal-avoidant WBRT (HA-WBRT), and observation (SRS or surgery alone) for 
this population to guide trial data collection efforts and reduce decision 
uncertainty.  METHODS: A time-dependent Markov model followed patients treated 
with neurosurgery or SRS who received subsequent WBRT, HA-WBRT or observation 
over a 5-year time horizon. Model inputs were sourced from published literature 
and results tested for robustness using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. 
Value of information (VOI) analysis was undertaken to guide data collection for 
the randomized trial.
RESULTS: Over 5 years, the WBRT strategy produced 1.74 QALYs (2.38 life-years) 
at a mean cost of $40,128 (costs in 2017 Australian dollars); HA-WBRT produced 
1.88 QALYs (2.38 life-years) and cost $42,977; and SRS/surgery alone produced 
1.65 QALYs (2.13 life-years) at a cost of $46,281. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed HA-WBRT was the preferred strategy in 77% of simulations. 
Cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to utilities of the 
controlled-disease health state in the WBRT group, and costs of HA-WBRT. The 
EVPI for a randomized trial was estimated at $6,888 per person.
CONCLUSIONS: HA-WBRT may be cost-effective for the treatment of melanoma brain 
metastases. The results predicted in our model can be validated with prospective 
trial data when available.

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are important enzymes that transfer acetyl 
groups onto histones and thereby regulate both gene expression and chromosomal 
structures. Previous work has shown that the activation of sirtuins, which are 
histone deacetylases, can extend lifespan. This suggests that inhibiting HATs 
may have a similar beneficial effect. In the present study, we utilized a range 
of HAT inhibitors or heterozygous Gcn5 and Ngg1 mutants to demonstrate marked 
yeast life extension. In human cell lines, HAT inhibitors and selective 
RNAi-mediated Gcn5 or Ngg1 knockdown reduced the levels of aging markers and 
promoted proliferation in senescent cells. Furthermore, this observed lifespan 
extension was associated with the acetylation of histone H3 rather than that of 
H4. Specifically, it was dependent upon H3K9Ac and H3K18Ac modifications. We 
also found that the ability of caloric restriction to prolong lifespan is Gcn5-, 
Ngg1-, H3K9-, and H3K18-dependent. Transcriptome analysis revealed that these 
changes were similar to those associated with heat shock and were inversely 
correlated with the gene expression profiles of aged yeast and aged worms. 
Through a bioinformatic analysis, we also found that HAT inhibition activated 
subtelomeric genes in human cell lines. Together, our results suggest that 
inhibiting the HAT Gcn5 may be an effective means of increasing longevity.

BACKGROUND: Depression in China has risen from the 15th leading cause of 
all-cause disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 1990 to the 10th in 2017. 
However, the burden of depression and the epidemiological trend in Chinese 
provinces remain unclear. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and burden 
of depression among different sexes, ages, disease types and provincial 
administrative units in China.
METHODS: Based on a general analysis of the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 
in 2017, we analyzed the age- sex- and province-specific prevalence and DALYs of 
depression in China from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2017, the all-age prevalence rate of depression per 
100,000 rose from 3224.6 (95% UI:2976.6-3509.1) to 3990.5 (95% UI: 
3667.8-4353.0), and the DALY rate per 100,000 rose from 525.1 (95% UI: 
373.5-719.0) to 607.4 (95% UI: 427.7-820.2). The prevalence rate decreased in 
the population aged 5-54 years, and increased in the population aged over 55 
years. In 2017, the prevalence rate of females (5039.6, 95% UI: 4630.0-5502.8) 
was significantly higher than that of males (2984.9, 95% UI: 2736.0-3265.3). The 
prevalence and DALY rate increased in all provinces. However, the 
age-standardized prevalence and DALYs rate decreased in 31 provinces.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression has gradually become a major public health issue in 
China. The government should take measures to prevent the development of 
depression immediately. Women and the elderly are at high risk for depression.

[Purpose] The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between range 
of motion/muscle strength of the spine and lower limbs with 1) radiographic 
sagittal alignment and 2) quality of life of participants with spinal 
deformities to adequately target the appropriate factors for effective 
treatment. [Participants and Methods] This study used an observational 
cross-sectional correlational design. Participants with spinal deformities and 
low back pain were recruited for the study. The dependent variables were range 
of motion/muscle strength of the spine and lower limbs, sagittal alignment, and 
quality of life. [Results] Regarding alignment, significant correlations were 
found between hip extension range of motion and sagittal vertebral axis; between 
occiput-to-wall distance and thoracolumbar kyphosis; and between back extensor 
endurance and pelvic tilt and pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch, also 
known as the calculated (pelvic incidence) minus (lumbar lordosis) value. With 
regards to quality of life, significant correlations were found between 
pain-related disorders and lumbar spine range of motion, and between gait 
disturbance and knee and hip extension ranges of motion. [Conclusion] Our 
findings suggest that these factors should be targeted for assessment and 
treatment of adults with spinal deformities.

Background and Purpose: Early life microbiota plays a crucial role in human 
health by acting as a barrier from pathogens' invasion and maintaining the 
intestinal immune homoeostasis. Altered fecal microbiota (FM) ecology was 
reported in newborns affected by intestinal ischemia. Our purpose was to 
describe, in these patients, the FM, the mucosal microbiota (MM) and the mucosal 
immunity. Methods: Fourteen newborns underwent intestinal resection because of 
intestinal ischemia. FM and MM were determined through targeted-metagenomics, 
diversity assignment and Kruskal-Wallis analyses of Operational taxonomic units 
(OTUs). The mucosal immune cells were analyzed through cytofluorimetry. Results 
and Conclusion: Based on the severity intestinal injueris we identified two 
groups: extensive (EII) and focal intestinal ischemia (FII). FM and MM varied in 
EII and FII groups, showing in the EII group the predominance of Proteobacteria 
and Enterobacteriaceae and the reduction of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia 
for both microbiota. The MM was characterized by a statistically significant 
reduction of Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and by a higher 
diversity in the EII compared to FII group. FM showed a prevalence of 
Proteobacteria, while the Shannon index was lower in the EII compared to FII 
group. An overall increment in B- and T-lymphocytes and Natural killer (NK) 
T-like cells was found for EII mucosal samples associated to an increment of 
TNF-α and INF-γ expressing cells, compared to FII group. FM and MM carry 
specific signatures of intestinal ischemic lesions. Further research may be 
crucial to address the role of specific taxa in EII, expecially with reference 
to inflammation grade and ischemia extension.

Significance: The prevalence and incidence of age-related neurodegenerative 
diseases (NDDs) tend to increase along with the enhanced average of the world 
life expectancy. NDDs are a major cause of morbidity and disability, affecting 
the health care, social and economic systems with a significant impact. Critical 
Issues and Recent Advances: Despite the worldwide burden of NDDs and the ongoing 
research efforts to increase the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in NDD 
pathophysiologies, pharmacological therapies have been presenting merely narrow 
benefits. On the contrary, absent of detrimental side effects but growing 
merits, regular physical exercise (PE) has been considered a prone pleiotropic 
nonpharmacological alternative able to modulate brain structure and function, 
thereby stimulating a healthier and "fitness" neurological phenotype. Future 
Directions: This review summarizes the state of the art of some peripheral and 
central-related mechanisms that underlie the impact of PE on brain plasticity as 
well as its relevance for the prevention and/or treatment of NDDs. Nevertheless, 
further studies are needed to better clarify the molecular signaling pathways 
associated with muscle contractions-related myokines release and its plausible 
positive effects in the brain. In addition, particular focus of research should 
address the role of PE in the modulation of mitochondrial metabolism and 
oxidative stress in the context of NDDs.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Brazil. In the 
2000s, better understanding of molecular pathways led to development of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted treatments that have improved 
outcomes. However, these treatments are unavailable in most Brazilian public 
healthcare services (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential number of years of life not saved, the budget 
impact of the treatment and strategies to improve access.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Pharmacoeconomic study assessing the potential societal and 
economic impact of adopting EGFR-targeted therapy within SUS.
METHODS: We estimated the number of cases eligible for treatment, using 
epidemiological data from the National Cancer Institute. We used data from a 
single meta-analysis and from the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) study 
as the basis for assessing differences in patients' survival between use of 
targeted therapy and use of chemotherapy. The costs of targeted treatment were 
based on the national reference and were compared with the amount reimbursed for 
chemotherapy through SUS.
RESULTS: There was no life-year gain with EGFR-targeted therapy in the single 
meta-analysis (hazard ratio, HR, 1.01). The LCMC showed that 1,556 potential 
life-years were not saved annually. We estimated that the annual budget impact 
was 125 million Brazilian reais (BRL) with erlotinib, 48 million BRL with 
gefitinib and 52 million BRL with afatinib. Their incremental costs over 
chemotherapy per life-year saved were 80,329 BRL, 31,011 BRL and 33,225 BRL, 
respectively. A drug acquisition discount may decrease the budget impact by 30% 
(with a 20% discount). A fixed cost of 1,000 BRL may decrease the budget impact 
by 95%.
CONCLUSION: Reducing drug acquisition costs may improve access to EGFR-targeted 
therapy for lung cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Approximately between 1.5 and 3.0 per 1000 people are affected by 
venous leg ulcers (VLUs). The treatment and management of VLUs is costly and 
recurrence is a major concern. There is evidence that compression stockings can 
reduce the rate of re-ulceration compared with no compression. We present the 
first cost-effective analysis of compression stockings in preventing recurrence 
of VLUs from the perspective of the Ontario healthcare system.
METHOD: A cost-utility analysis with a five-year time horizon was conducted. Use 
of compression stockings was compared with usual care (no compression 
stockings). We simulated a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients with 
healed VLUs, using a state-transition model. Model input parameters were 
obtained mainly from the published literature. We estimated quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained and direct medical costs. We conducted various 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, compression stockings were associated with 
higher costs and increased QALYs. Cost-utility analysis showed that the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of compression stockings was $23,864 per 
QALY gained compared with no compression stockings. The most influential drivers 
of cost-effectiveness were the utility value of healed VLUs, cost of stockings, 
number of stocking replacements, monthly prevention cost and the risk of VLU 
recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care, compression stockings were cost-effective 
in preventing VLUs, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000. These 
observations were consistent even when uncertainty in model inputs and 
parameters were considered.

In this study, we shed light on the interdependency of child growth, morbidity 
and life expectancy in the fisher-hunter-gatherers of the Jabuticabeira II shell 
mound (1214-830 cal B.C.E. - 118-413 cal C.E.) located at the South Coast of 
Brazil. We test the underlying causes of heterogeneity in frailty and selective 
mortality in a population that inhabits a plentiful environment in sedentary 
settlements. We reconstruct osteobiographies of 41 individuals (23 adults and 18 
subadults) using 8 variables, including age-at-death, stature, non-specific 
stress markers (cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, periosteal reactions, 
periapical lesions and linear enamel hypoplasia), as well as weaning patterns 
based on stable isotope data to examine how stress factors module growth and 
survival. Our results show that shorter adult statures were linked to higher 
morbidity around weaning age and higher chances of dying earlier (before 35 
years) than taller adult statures. In addition, short juvenile stature was 
related to physiological stressors and mortality. The adult "survivors" 
experienced recurrent periods of morbidity during childhood and adulthood, 
possibly associated with the high parasite load of the ecosystem and dense 
settlement rather than to malnourishment. An association between early-stress 
exposure and premature death was not demonstrated in our sample. To explain our 
data, we propose a new model called "intermittent stress of low lethality". 
According to this model, individuals are exposed to recurrent stress during the 
juvenile and adult stages of life, and, nevertheless survive until reproductive 
age or later with relative success.

OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence supports sequential therapy with anabolic followed 
by antiresorptive in patients at high-risk of fragility fractures. This study 
assessed the cost-effectiveness of sequential treatment with abaloparatide (ABL) 
followed by alendronate (ALN) [(ABL/ALN)] compared to ALN monotherapy and to 
sequential treatment starting with antiresorptive therapy (ALN/ABL/ALN).
METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was used to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequential ABL/ALN compared to ALN 
monotherapy and to sequential ALN/ABL/ALN from a lifetime US payer perspective. 
In line with practice guidelines, patients were assumed to receive ABL for 18 
months followed by 5 years of ALN, or ALN monotherapy for 5 years, or a sequence 
of ALN for 2 years followed by 18 months of ABL and then by 3 years ALN. 
Evaluation was conducted for patients aged 50-80 years old with a BMD T-score 
≤-3.5 and without a history of prior fracture, or with a T-score between -2.5 
and -3.5 and a history of ≥ 1 osteoporotic fracture.
RESULTS: Sequential ABL/ALN was cost-effective (threshold of US$150,000 per 
QALY) vs generic ALN monotherapy in women ≥60 years with a BMD T-score ≤-3.5 and 
in women with BMD T-score between -2.5 and -3.5 and history of osteoporotic 
fracture. In all simulated populations, sequential ABL/ALN therapy was dominant 
(lower costs, more QALYs) compared with sequential ALN/ABL/ALN, resulting from 
limited effect of ABL in patients previously treated with an antiresorptive 
agent.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequential ABL/ALN therapy is cost-effective vs ALN monotherapy for 
US postmenopausal women aged ≥60 years at increased risk of fractures.

The incidence of certain forms of tumors has increased progressively in recent 
years and is expected to continue growing as life expectancy continues to 
increase. Tumor-infiltrating NK cells may contribute to develop an anti-tumor 
response. Optimized combinations of different cancer therapies, including NK 
cell-based approaches for targeting tumor cells, have the potential to open new 
avenues in cancer immunotherapy. Functional inhibitory receptors on NK cells are 
needed to prevent their attack on healthy cells. Nevertheless, disruption of 
inhibitory receptors function on NK cells increases the cytotoxic capacity of NK 
cells against cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA 
molecules that target mRNA and thus regulate the expression of genes involved in 
the development, maturation, and effector functions of NK cells. Therapeutic 
strategies that target the regulatory effects of miRNAs have the potential to 
improve the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy. Interestingly, emerging evidence 
points out that some miRNAs can, directly and indirectly, control the surface 
expression of immune checkpoints on NK cells or that of their ligands on tumor 
cells. This suggests a possible use of miRNAs in the context of anti-tumor 
therapy. This review provides the current overview of the connections between 
miRNAs and regulation of NK cell functions and discusses the potential of these 
miRNAs as innovative biomarkers/targets for cancer immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Assessment tools for early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease are 
limited. Detecting early pulmonary disease is crucial to increasing life 
expectancy by starting interventions to slow the progression of the pulmonary 
disease with the many treatment options available.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the utility of lung T1-mapping MRI with ultrashort echo 
time (UTE) MRI in children with cystic fibrosis in detecting early stage lung 
disease and monitoring pulmonary exacerbations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 16 children between 
September 2017 and January 2018. In Phase 1, we compared five CF patients with 
normal spirometry (mean 11.2 years) to five age- and gender-matched healthy 
volunteers. In Phase 2, we longitudinally evaluated six CF patients (median 
11 years) in acute pulmonary exacerbation. All children had non-contrast lung 
T1-mapping and UTE MRI and spirometry testing. We compared the mean normalized 
T1 value and percentage lung volume without T1 value in CF patients and healthy 
subjects in Phase 1 and during treatment in Phase 2. We also performed cystic 
fibrosis MRI scoring. We evaluated differences in continuous variables using 
standard statistical tests.
RESULTS: In Phase 1, mean normalized T1 values of the lung were significantly 
lower in CF patients in comparison to healthy controls (P=0.02) except in the 
right lower lobe (P=0.29). The percentage lung volume without T1 value was also 
significantly higher in CF patients (P=0.006). UTE MRI showed no significant 
differences between CF patients and healthy volunteers (P=0.11). In Phase 2, 
excluding one outlier case who developed systemic disease in the course of 
treatment, the whole-lung T1 value increased (P=0.001) and perfusion scoring 
improved (P=0.02) following therapy. We observed no other significant changes in 
the MRI scoring.
CONCLUSION: Lung T1-mapping MRI can detect early regional pulmonary CF disease 
in children and might be helpful in the assessment of acute pulmonary 
exacerbations.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a genetic disease caused by a deficiency 
of the lysosomal hydrolase α-L-iduronidase (IDUA). IDUA degrades two types of 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): heparan and dermatan sulfates, important components 
of extracellular matrix, with signaling and structural functions. The 
accumulation of GAGs results in progressive physiological impairments in a 
variety of tissues, making MPS I a complex and multisystemic disease. Due the 
advent of therapeutic strategies which have increased patients' life expectancy, 
our group have been investigating the effect of IDUA deficiency on the 
reproductive system. In the present study, we aimed to characterize some of the 
accessory glands of the male reproductive tract in an MPS I mouse model. We used 
6-month-old Idua+/+ and Idua-/- male mice to evaluate the histology of the 
seminal vesicles and prostate. Interstitial deposits of GAGs and collagen fibers 
were also observed. Seminal vesicles were smaller in the Idua-/- group, 
regardless of the normal staining pattern of the epithelial cells, marked with 
antiandrogen receptor. The prostate of Idua-/- mice presented necrotic acini and 
increased deposition of collagen fibers in the interstitium. All glands 
presented evident deposits of GAGs in the extracellular matrix, especially 
inside vacuolated interstitial cells. We concluded that, at this stage of the 
disease, the prostate is the most damaged accessory gland and may therefore, be 
the first to manifest functional impairments during disease progression.

Modulation of the ageing process by dietary restriction (DR) across multiple 
taxa is well established. While the exact mechanism through which DR acts 
remains elusive, the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulphide (H2S) may play an 
important role. We employed a comparative-type approach using females from three 
ILSXISS recombinant inbred mouse strains previously reported to show 
differential lifespan responses following 40% DR. Following long-term 
(10 months) 40% DR, strain TejJ89-reported to show lifespan extension under 
DR-exhibited elevated hepatic H2S production relative to its strain-specific ad 
libitum (AL) control. Strain TejJ48 (no reported lifespan effect following 40% 
DR) exhibited significantly reduced hepatic H2S production, while H2S production 
was unaffected by DR in strain TejJ114 (shortened lifespan reported following 
40% DR). These differences in H2S production were reflected in highly divergent 
gene and protein expression profiles of the major H2S production and disposal 
enzymes across strains. Increased hepatic H2S production in TejJ89 mice was 
associated with elevation of the mitochondrial H2S-producing enzyme 
3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). Our findings further support the 
potential role of H2S in DR-induced longevity and indicate the presence of 
genotypic-specificity in the production and disposal of hepatic H2S in response 
to 40% DR in mice.

AIMS: In this study, the effects of licorice flavonoid oil (LFO) supplementation 
on mobility functions were evaluated in middle-aged and older women who 
underwent daily physical exercise.
METHODS: The 73 women aged 59-85 years (71.2 ± 5.2 years) were randomly assigned 
to the LFO group (n = 37) or the placebo group (n = 36). For 16 weeks, the LFO 
group consumed a daily capsule containing 300 mg of LFO, while the placebo group 
consumed a placebo capsule. All participants were instructed to complete a 
strength training program during the 16 weeks and to increase their daily step 
count by 1000. 10-m walking speed (with/no obstruction), one-leg standing time 
with eyes open, handgrip strength, isometric knee extension strength, and body 
composition were evaluated at baseline and every eight weeks.
RESULTS: In the 10-m walking speeds (with/no obstruction), LFO supplementation 
did not show significant improvements. One-leg standing time was significantly 
prolonged with LFO intake (LFO: baseline 73.9 s vs 16 weeks 93.5, placebo: 
baseline 82.8 vs 16 weeks 87.1, p = 0.03). In addition, a significant decrease 
in BMI and body fat percentage with LFO was found (p = 0.01, p = 0.03, 
respectively).
DISCUSSION: Since a lower BMI corresponds to a lighter physical load on the 
lower limb, in addition, since LFO might improve skeletal muscle function by 
antioxidant activity, participants could stand longer and body balance control 
was improved.
CONCLUSION: LFO supplementation improved body balance control and may contribute 
to fall prevention in healthy middle-aged and older women having daily physical 
exercise.

Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88) plays an important role in both innate 
and adaptive immune response. In this study, the full-length complementary DNA 
(cDNA) of myd88 from Misgurnus anguillicaudatus was characterized. The myd88 
cDNA is 1333 bp in length and contains an 855 bp open reading frame encoding a 
predicted protein of 284 amino acids. The predicted protein possesses typical 
Myd88 domain structural features including a death domain in the N-terminus, and 
box 1, 2, and 3 motifs of the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain in the C-terminus. 
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that myd88 messenger RNA (mRNA) 
was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, especially highly in brain, 
kidney, blood, intestines and liver. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to 
determine the mRNA and protein levels of Myd88 after Aeromonas veronii 
challenge, respectively. The Myd88 was remarkably upregulated in response to 
infection of A. veronii. These results suggested that Myd88 may play a vital 
role during the immune response of M. anguillicaudatus against bacterial 
infection.

BACKGROUND: Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the mainstay of neuroendocrine tumor 
(NET) treatment. Biliary stone disease is reported as a common side effect of 
SSAs, with a frequency ranging from 10% to 63%. Studies on SSA-treated patients 
for acromegaly report an increased incidence of biliary stone disease compared 
with the general population, whereas data on patients with NETs are few. 
Guidelines are based on weak evidence, thus resulting in conflicting 
recommendations. The aim of the study is to evaluate biliary stone disease 
incidence, complications, and risk factors in a large population of SSA-treated 
patients with NETs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected 
database was performed. Patients with a diagnosis of NET in seven dedicated 
centers from 1995 to 2017 were included at the time of SSA start.
RESULTS: A total of 754 SSA-treated patients were evaluated. Patients with 
history of cholecystectomy or with known biliary stone disease were excluded; 
478 patients were included. Among them, 118 patients (24.7%) received 
prophylactic ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). During the study period, 129 patients 
(27.0%) developed biliary stone disease; of them, 36 (27.9%) developed biliary 
complications. On multivariate analysis, primary gastrointestinal (GI)-NET 
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.76) and related surgery (HR 1.58) were independent risk 
factors for biliary stone disease.
CONCLUSION: We report a high incidence of biliary stone disease particularly in 
GI-NET or GI surgery. UDCA prophylaxis does not seem to have a protective role. 
Our data suggest that all patients with primary GI-NET or undergoing abdominal 
surgery should be considered for prophylactic cholecystectomy; no conclusion 
could be drawn on the indication of prophylactic cholecystectomy in patients 
with primary pancreatic or thoracic NET for whom abdominal surgery is not 
planned.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this study confirm an increased rate 
of gallstones development and related complications in patients with 
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) treated with somatostatin analogs (SSAs). NETs of 
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and related surgery are independent risk factors 
for biliary stone disease development. Therefore, all patients with primary 
GI-NET or undergoing abdominal surgery should be considered for prophylactic 
cholecystectomy. Data on other subgroups are not exhaustive, and management also 
evaluating additional clinical features (life expectancy, surgical and 
anesthesiological risks) should be considered. Prophylactic treatment with 
ursodeoxycholic acid does not seem to be a protective factor for SSA-related 
biliary stone disease.

We introduce a compartmental model of ordinary differential equations for the 
population dynamics of listeriosis, and we derive a model for analysing a 
listeriosis outbreak. The model explicitly accommodates neonatal infections. 
Similarly as is common in cholera modeling, we include a compartment to 
represent the reservoir of bacteria. We also include a compartment to represent 
the incubation phase. For the 2017/18 listeriosis outbreak that happened in 
South Africa, we calculate the time pattern and intensity of the force of 
infection, and we determine numerical values for some of the parameters in the 
model. The model is calibrated using South African data, together with existing 
data in the open literature not necessarily from South Africa. We make 
projections on the future outlook of the epidemiology of the disease and the 
possibility of eradication.

Previous studies on joint kinetics during track and field block starts have been 
limited to lower-limb sagittal kinetics; however, we hypothesised that 
lumbopelvic extensors, lateral flexors, and hip abductors also act as 
substantial energy generators. The present study aimed to examine the 
three-dimensional lumbo-pelvic-hip kinetics to better understand the generation 
of mechanical energy during a block start. 3D kinematic and force data during 
block starts of 10 m maximal sprinting in 12 male sprinters (personal best in a 
100 m sprint, 10.78 ± 0.19 s [range, 10.43-11.01 s]) were captured using a 
motion capture system and force platform. The three-dimensional lumbo-pelvic-hip 
kinetics were calculated. The peak lumbosacral extension torque (3.64 ± 0.39 
Nm/kg) was significantly larger than any other lower-limb and lumbosacral 
torques (<3.0 Nm/kg). It was suggested that large lumbopelvic extension torques 
are needed during the block start to anchor the pelvis by cancelling out both
