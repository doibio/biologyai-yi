and postnatal age. Those with maternal thyroid disorders, thyrotropic medication 
and life expectancy <12 hours were excluded. We compared serum tri-iodothyronine 
(T3), thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) between the groups by 
univariate and multivariate (adjusting for SNAPPE-II) analysis.
RESULTS: Median (IQR) TSH was significantly lower in Group A [1.39 (0.83,3.48)] 
vs Group B [5.1 (2.32,7.19)] mmol/dL (P<0.001). Serum T3 and T4 were also lower 
in Group A (P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, none of these measures were 
independently associated with septic shock.
CONCLUSION: Thyroid hormone levels do not independently predict presence of 
shock among septic preterms.

As part of its single technology appraisal (STA) process, the UK National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of 
evolocumab (Amgen) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of 
evolocumab. The appraisal assessed evolocumab as monotherapy or in combination 
with a statin with or without ezetimibe, or in combination with ezetimibe 
(without statin therapy), in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia 
(which includes mixed dyslipidaemia), for whom statins do not provide optimal 
control of their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and/or for 
whom statins are contraindicated or not tolerated. The School of Health and 
Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was 
commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG 
produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of the technology based on the company's submission to NICE. The 
evidence was derived mainly from four randomised controlled trials comparing 
evolocumab with either ezetimibe or placebo in adults with primary familial or 
non-familial hypercholesterolaemia, who were either able to take statins or who 
were statin intolerant. The clinical-effectiveness review found that evolocumab 
is efficacious at lowering LDL-C but that there was uncertainty regarding its 
impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. In response to the ERG's 
critique of the submitted health economic model, the company submitted an 
amended model, which also included a patient access scheme (PAS). Based on this, 
the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for evolocumab 
against ezetimibe were above £74,000 and £45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained within the non-familial primary and secondary prevention 
populations, respectively, whilst the ICER within the heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) population was approximately £23,000 per QALY 
gained. The final determination was that evolocumab would be a clinically and 
cost-effective use of UK NHS resource in certain patient subgroups.

Human life expectancy and the number of the oldest old are rapidly increasing 
worldwide. Advanced age is the main risk factor for dementia, representing one 
of the major causes of disability/dependency among older people with a strong 
impact on their families/caregivers. Centenarians have reached the extreme 
limits of human life escaping or delaying the major age-related diseases. Thus, 
these extraordinary individuals embody the best model to answer the crucial 
question if cognitive decline and dementia are progressive and unavoidable 
occurrences of increasing age. Despite a growing amount of data underlines the 
importance of cognitive function for quality of life and survival in old age, 
studies on centenarians have paid more attention to their physical condition 
rather than the assessment of their actual cognitive abilities. Accordingly, 
this work aims to summarize available data on the prevalence of dementia in 
centenarians and to critically address topics which can have a relevant impact 
on the cognitive assessment/status of the oldest old: (i) lack of standardized 
tools for cognitive assessment; (ii) criteria and threshold to establish the 
presence of dementia; (iii) influence of birth cohort and education; (iv) role 
of depression or positive attitude towards life; (v) gender differences.

European Union (EU) enlargements in 2004 and 2007 were accompanied by increased 
migration from new-accession to established-member (EU-15) countries. The 
impacts of these flows depend, in part, on the amount of time that persons from 
the former countries live in the latter over the life course. In this paper, we 
develop period estimates of duration expectancy in EU-15 countries among persons 
from new-accession countries. Using a newly developed set of harmonised Bayesian 
estimates of migration flows each year from 2002 to 2008 from the Integrated 
Modelling of European Migration (IMEM) Project, we exploit period age patterns 
of country-to-country migration and mortality to summarize the average number of 
years that persons from new-accession countries could be expected to live in 
EU-15 countries over the life course. In general, the results show that the 
amount of time that persons from new-accession countries could be expected to 
live in the EU-15 nearly doubled after 2004.

PURPOSE: Maintenance and enhancement of vascular endothelial function contribute 
to the prevention of cardiovascular disease and prolong a healthy life 
expectancy. Given the reversible nature of vascular endothelial function, 
interventions to improve this function might prevent arteriosclerosis. 
Accordingly, we studied the effects of a 6-month static stretching intervention 
on vascular endothelial function (reactive hyperaemia peripheral arterial 
tonometry index: RH-PAT index) and arterial stiffness (brachial-ankle pulse wave 
velocity: baPWV) and investigated the reversibility of these effects after a 
6-month detraining period following intervention completion.
METHODS: The study evaluated 22 healthy, non-smoking, premenopausal women aged 
≥40 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to the full-intervention (n = 11; 
mean age: 48.6 ± 2.8 years) or a half-intervention that included a control 
period (n = 11; mean age: 46.9 ± 3.6 years).
RESULTS: Body flexibility and vascular endothelial function improved 
significantly after 3 months of static stretching. In addition to these 
improvements, arterial stiffness improved significantly after a 6-month 
intervention. However, after a 6-month detraining period, vascular endothelial 
function, flexibility, and arterial stiffness all returned to preintervention 
conditions, demonstrating the reversibility of the obtained effects.
CONCLUSION: A 3-month static stretching intervention was found to improve 
vascular endothelial function, and an additional 3-month intervention also 
improved arterial stiffness. However, these effects were reversed by detraining.

Sex-Based Differences in the Determinants of Old Age Life Expectancy: The 
Influence of Perimenopause.

Falconi AM(1).

California.

Studies using the sensitive periods framework typically examine the effects of 
early life exposures on later life health, due to the significant growth and 
development occurring during the first few years of life. The menopausal 
transition (i.e., perimenopause) is similarly characterized by rapid 
physiological change, yet rarely has been tested as a sensitive window in 
adulthood. Cohort mortality data drawn from three historic populations, Sweden 
(1751-1919), France (1816-1919), and England and Wales (1841-1919), were 
analyzed using time series methods to assess whether conditions at midlife 
significantly influenced or "programmed" later life longevity. Results indicated 
a significant inverse association between mortality at ages 45-49, the average 
age range in which perimenopause occurred, and life expectancy at age 60 among 
females in all three countries. Study findings suggest a degree of plasticity 
associated with women's aging and, in particular, the age group correlated with 
perimenopause.

BACKGROUND: Conducting an adequately powered survival study in idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is challenging due to the rare nature of the disease 
and the need for extended follow-up. Consequently, registration trials of IPF 
treatments have not been designed to estimate long-term survival.
OBJECTIVE: To predict life expectancy for patients with IPF receiving 
pirfenidone versus best supportive care (BSC) in a population that met the 
inclusion criteria of patients enrolled in the ASCEND and CAPACITY trials.
METHODS: Kaplan-Meier survival data for pirfenidone and BSC were obtained from 
randomized controlled clinical studies (CAPACITY, ASCEND), an open-label 
extension study (RECAP), and the Inova Fairfax Hospital database. Data from the 
Inova registry were matched to the inclusion criteria of the CAPACITY and ASCEND 
trials. Life expectancy was estimated by the area under the curve of parametric 
survival distributions fit to the Kaplan-Meier data.
RESULTS: Mean (95% confidence interval) life expectancy was calculated as 8.72 
(7.65-10.15) years with pirfenidone and 6.24 (5.38-7.18) years with BSC. 
Therefore, pirfenidone improved life expectancy by 2.47 (1.26-4.17) years 
compared with BSC. In addition, treatment with pirfenidone recuperated 25% of 
the expected years of life lost due to IPF. Sensitivity analyses found that 
results were sensitive to the choice of parametric survival distribution, and 
alternative piecewise and parametric approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that this population of patients with IPF 
has an improved life expectancy if treated with pirfenidone compared with BSC.

Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) is a positive mosaic 
labeling system that has been widely applied in Drosophila neurobiological 
studies to depict intricate morphologies and to manipulate the function of genes 
in subsets of neurons within otherwise unmarked and unperturbed organisms. 
Genetic mosaics generated in the MARCM system are mediated through site-specific 
recombination between homologous chromosomes within dividing precursor cells to 
produce both marked (MARCM clones) and unmarked daughter cells during mitosis. 
An extension of the MARCM method, called twin-spot MARCM (tsMARCM), labels both 
of the twin cells derived from a common progenitor with two distinct colors. 
This technique was developed to enable the retrieval of useful information from 
both hemi-lineages. By comprehensively analyzing different pairs of tsMARCM 
clones, the tsMARCM system permits high-resolution neural lineage mapping to 
reveal the exact birth-order of the labeled neurons produced from common 
progenitor cells. Furthermore, the tsMARCM system also extends gene function 
studies by permitting the phenotypic analysis of identical neurons of different 
animals. Here, we describe how to apply the tsMARCM system to facilitate studies 
of neural development in Drosophila.

Human beings are subjected to aging and age-associated diseases. Life expectancy 
has improved impressively in the last century due to social and economic 
development, but despite increasing improvement is still more limited than 
average in those ones with chronic diseases such as treated HIV infection. There 
has been a substantial research on the underlying factors responsible for aging 
both in the general and the HIV-infected populations. Several specific targets 
for potential intervention have been identified but studies so far have been 
limited to small experiments in cultured cells or living beings other than 
humans such as mice or flies. Time has come for designing and developing human 
studies with those candidate therapies showing most promising benefits and least 
potential toxicities to treat age-related diseases.

PURPOSE: Mountain trekking involves level, uphill, and downhill walking (DW). 
Prolonged DW induces damage to leg muscles, reducing force generating ability 
and muscle coordination. These increase risks for more serious injuries and 
accidents in mountain trekking, thus a strategy to minimize muscle damage is 
warranted. It has been shown that low-intensity eccentric contractions confer 
protective effect on muscle damage induced by high-intensity eccentric 
contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that 5-min non-damaging DW would 
attenuate muscle damage induced by 40-min DW, but 5-min level walking (LW) would 
not.
METHODS: Untrained young men were allocated (n = 12/group) to either a control 
or one of the two preconditioning groups (PRE-DW or PRE-LW). The PRE-DW and 
PRE-LW groups performed 5-min DW (-28%) and 5-min LW, respectively, at 5 km/h 
with a load of 10% body mass, 1 week before 40-min DW (-28%, 5 km/h, 10% load). 
The control group performed 40-min DW only. Maximal knee extension strength, 
plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, and muscle soreness (0-100 mm visual 
analogue scale) were measured before and 24 h after 5-min DW and 5-min LW, and 
before and 24, 48, and 72 h after 40-min DW.
RESULTS: No significant changes in any variables were evident after 5-min DW and 
5-min LW. After 40-min DW, the control and PRE-LW groups showed significant 
(P<0.05) changes in the variables without significant differences between groups 
(control vs. PRE-LW; peak strength reduction: -19.2 ± 6.9% vs. -18.7 ± 11.0%, 
peak CK: 635.5 ± 306.0 vs. 639.6 ± 405.4 U/L, peak soreness: 81.4 ± 14.8 vs. 
72.0 ± 29.2 mm). These changes were significantly (P<0.05) attenuated (47-64%) 
for the PRE-DW group (-9.9 ± 9.6%, 339.3 ± 148.4 U/L, 27.8 ± 16.8 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the hypothesis and suggest that performing 
small volume of downhill walking is crucial in preparation for trekking.

[The benefits of breastfeeding and associated risks of replacement with baby 
formulas].

[Article in Spanish]

Breastfeeding is the nourishment designed by nature for the newborn and the 
infant; however its prevalence is nowadays not optimal. The aim of this article 
is to review the current evidence of the benefits of breastfeeding for children 
and society, and to elaborate the risks associated with the replacement of 
lactation with baby formulas. Breastfeeding is a protective factor for several 
infectious, atopic, and cardiovascular diseases as well as for leukaemia, 
necrotising enterocolitis, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. It 
also has a positive impact on neurodevelopment, improving IQ and reducing the 
risk of attention deficit disorder, and generalised developmental and 
behavioural disorders. Lactation can decrease the risk of sudden infant deaths 
syndrome by 36% and prevent 13% of infant mortality worldwide. Breastfeeding 
result in direct saving on the use of infant formulas and bottles, and 
indirectly on associated health costs, premature deaths, and quality-adjusted 
life years, among others. In addition, breastfeeding is environmentally 
friendly; it does not leave an ecological footprint in its production and 
consumption. The use of baby formulas and bottles have inherent risks, because 
they increase the risk of oral diseases, such as mouth breathing, malocclusion, 
alteration of bite, and tooth decay. Finally, the intestinal microbiota, 
oxygenation, and thermoregulation of infants are negatively affected by their 
use.

This article aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of non-hormonal targeted 
therapies (TTs) in terms of increase of median progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) in receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
patients by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. We systematically 
searched relevant randomized controlled trials and extracted data about number 
of patients on targeted and comparator therapy, receptor status, line of 
treatment, median PFS and OS, p values, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). Inverse variance was used to estimate pooled HRs, chi-square 
test for heterogeneity and Jadad scale for quality were applied. Thirty-eight 
studies (n=17,192 patients) were eligible for inclusion. TTs added 3.3months to 
the median PFS [0.7-9.6; HRs 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.77] of receptor-positive MBC 
patients and prolonged their median OS with 3.5months [0-4.7; HRs 0.90, 95% CI 
0.82-0.98]. The highest increase in median PFS of 3.6months was found in 
HER2-/hormone receptor(HR)+ patients, while the highest increase in median OS of 
7.2months was observed in HER2+/HRmixed status patients. First-line TTs were 
most effective in increasing the median PFS in the HR+/HER2- group with 
2.0months, and in the HER2+/HRmixed group by adding 4.7months to the median OS. 
Second-line TTs were most effective for HER2-/HR+ patients by adding 2.6months 
to their PFS, and for HER2+/HRmixed patients by adding 3.1months to their median 
OS. Albeit small, the gain in months of median PFS and median OS was 
significant. Importantly, the results reported show large variation, and thus 
routinely applying a personalized approach seems warranted.

AIMS: To explore the acceptability of a telephone- or a group-delivered diabetes 
prevention program for women with previous gestational diabetes and to compare 
the characteristics associated with program engagement.
METHODS: Postpartum women participated in a lifestyle modification program 
delivered by telephone (n=33) or group format (n=284). Semi-structured 
interviews on barriers and enablers to program engagement (defined as 
completing≥80% sessions) were conducted before (Group) and after (Group and 
Telephone) interventions. The Health Action Process Approach theory was used as 
the framework for inquiry. Psychological measures were compared between 
engagement subgroups before and after group-delivered intervention.
RESULTS: In the telephone-delivered program 82% participants met the engagement 
criteria compared with 38% for the group-delivered program. Engaged participants 
(Group) had significantly higher risk perception, outcome expectancy, and 
activity self-efficacy at baseline (P<0.05). There was a greater decrease in 
body weight (-1.45±3.9 vs -0.26±3.5, P=0.024) and waist circumference (-3.56±5.1 
vs -1.24±5.3, P=0.002) for engaged vs non-engaged participants following group 
program completion.
CONCLUSIONS: Telephone delivery was associated with greater engagement in 
postpartum women. Engagement was associated with greater reduction in weight and 
waist circumference. Further studies are required to confirm the effectiveness 
of telephone-delivered program for diabetes prevention in postpartum women.

With the currently available combined antiretroviral therapy regimens, durable 
suppression of viral replication, preservation of immune function and 
normalizing life expectancy, are all becoming achievable goals. Teenagers and 
young adults living with HIV present unique clinical and pharmacologic 
challenges to optimizing antiretroviral treatment outcomes. Areas covered: In 
this expert review of the topic, we examine recent clinical trial data and draw 
on our program's 25 year experience working with both perinatally and 
behaviorally HIV infected adolescents. Expert commentary: In order to be 
effective, the antiretrovirals we provide must be combined with 
multidisciplinary interventions and ongoing socio-behavioral support to ensure 
treatment adherence and prevent the emergence of viral resistance.

BACKGROUND: Despite growing evidence for manualized psychodynamic treatments, 
there is a lack of studies on their transfer to routine practice. This is the 
first study to examine the effects of an additional training in manualized Short 
Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) on the outcome in routine psychotherapy 
for social anxiety disorder (SAD). The study is an extension to a large RCT 
comparing STPP to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy of SAD.
METHODS: The manualized treatment was designed for a time limited approach with 
25 individual sessions of STPP over 6 months. Private practitioners were 
randomized to training in manualized STPP (mSTPP) vs. treatment as usual without 
a specific training (tauSTPP). A total of 109 patients were enrolled (105 
started treatment; 75 completed at least 20 treatment sessions). Assessments 
were conducted pre-treatment, after 8 and 15 weeks, after 25 treatment sessions, 
at the end of treatment, 6 and 12 months after termination of treatment. 
Remission as primary outcome was defined by the Liebowitz-Social-Anxiety-Scale 
(LSAS) score ≤30. Secondary outcomes were response (at least 31% reduction in 
LSAS), treatment duration and number of sessions, changes in social anxiety 
(LSAS, SPAI), depression (BDI), clinical global impression (CGI), and quality of 
life (EQ-5D).
RESULTS: Remission rates of mSTPP (9%) resp. tauSTPP (16%) and also response 
rates of 33% resp. 28% were comparable between the two treatment approaches as 
well as treatment duration and number of sessions. Most of the within-group 
differences (baseline to 25 sessions) indicated moderate to large improvements 
in both treatments; within-group differences from baseline to 12 months 
follow-up (LSAS, SPAI, BDI, CGI) were large ranging from d = -0.605 to 
d = -2.937. Benefits of mSTPP were limited to single outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings are discussed with regard to implementation and 
dissemination of empirically validated treatments in psychodynamic training and 
practice. SAD patients with a high comorbidity of personality disorders and a 
long treatment history may need longer treatments.

OBJECTIVES: Road traffic injuries (RTI) cause a significant number of injuries 
and deaths in China every year; the World Health Organization estimated 261,367 
deaths due to RTI in 2013. As a result of the ongoing growth of China's economy, 
road construction and motorisation, RTI are expected to impose a heavy health 
burden in the future. However, the public and policy makers have not widely 
perceived RTI as a public health issue commensurate with its consequences, in 
part, due to a lack of intuitive indicator measuring the health impact.
STUDY DESIGN: Employs the cause-eliminating life table technique to provide a 
measure of the burden of RTI based on data from a nationally representative 
surveillance system in China.
METHODS: Previous studies have used indicators such as event counts, rates and 
disability-adjusted life years to measure the health impact of RTI; but this 
study uses potential gains in life expectancy to measure this impact.
RESULTS: Eliminating RTI could lead to a gain of 0.52 years in life expectancy 
in 2012, meaning that on average Chinese people could live a half year more than 
they would in the presence of RTI. Males have a substantially higher RTI death 
rate and consequently could have a gain in life expectancy more than twice as 
large as females (male 0.72 years vs female 0.28 years). The gain in rural areas 
(0.65 years) is twice that in urban areas (0.32 years).
CONCLUSIONS: The significant gain in life expectancy signals the urgency for 
public actions to improve road safety; the disparity in the burden across 
regions and sexes indicate a great opportunity for targeted interventions to 
protect health and save lives.

OBJECTIVE: Few studies have sought to establish how often death after sepsis is 
related to the sepsis and how often underlying diseases have a major role in 
case fatality.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, data were collected on 497 cases 
with blood culture-positive sepsis in an emergency department (ED).
RESULTS: Sepsis was categorized as severe in 31% of cases; 7% had septic shock. 
The quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score was positive in 136 out 
of 473 cases (29%). Ninety-eight patients died by day 90; in 16 of these cases 
(16%) the death was sepsis-related in a patient without a rapidly fatal 
underlying disease, in 45 cases (46%) the death was sepsis-related in a patient 
with a rapidly fatal underlying disease, and in 37 cases (38%) the death was 
unrelated to sepsis. Sepsis-related death occurred in 58 out of 61 cases (95%) 
by day 28.
CONCLUSIONS: Underlying diseases were found to have a considerable role in the 
death of patients suffering from blood culture-positive sepsis in an ED of a 
developed country, as only 16% of the deaths by day 90 occurred where death was 
sepsis-related and the patient had a life-expectancy of more than 6 months. 
Improving the outcome of sepsis with new treatments is thus challenging. It is 
possible that day 7+day 28 mortality is a more appropriate endpoint than day 90 
mortality when studying the outcome of sepsis, as this time-span includes most 
of the patients whose death was related to sepsis.

causes of death.

INTRODUCTION: In Slovenia, longevity is increasing rapidly. From 1997 to 2014, 
life expectancy at birth increased by 7 and 5 years for men and women, 
respectively. This paper explores how this gain in life expectancy at birth can 
be attributed to reduced mortality from five major groups of causes of death by 
5-year age groups. It also estimates potential future gains in life expectancy 
at birth.
METHODS: The importance of the five major causes of death was analysed by 
cause-elimination life tables. The total elimination of individual causes of 
death and a partial hypothetical adjustment of mortality to Spanish levels were 
analysed, along with age and cause decomposition (Pollard).
RESULTS: During the 1997-2014 period, the increase in life expectancy at birth 
was due to lower mortality from circulatory diseases (ages above 60, both 
genders), as well as from lower mortality from neoplasms (ages above 50 years) 
and external causes (between 20 and 50 years) for men. However, considering the 
potential future gains in life expectancy at birth, by far the strongest effect 
can be attributed to lower mortality due to circulatory diseases for both 
genders. If Spanish mortality rates were reached, life expectancy at birth would 
increase by more than 2 years, again mainly because of lower mortality from 
circulatory diseases in very old ages.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy analyses can improve evidence-based 
decision-making and allocation of resources among different prevention 
programmes and measures for more effective disease management that can also 
reduce the economic burden of chronic diseases.

Publisher: UVOD: V Sloveniji se življenje hitro podaljšuje. V obdobju od leta 
1997 do leta 2014 se je pričakovano trajanje življenja ob rojstvu podaljšalo za 
7 let za moške in za 5 let za ženske. V članku ugotavljamo, koliko je k temu 
povišanju v Sloveniji do leta 2014 prispevalo zniževanje umrljivosti po petih 
glavnih skupinah vzrokov smrti in po posameznih starostnih razredih. Poleg tega 
v članku ocenjujemo tudi potencialno bodoče podaljšanje pričakovanega trajanja 
življenja ob rojstvu za Slovenijo.
METODE: Uporabili smo skrajšane tablice umrljivosti s petletnimi starostnimi 
razredi. Razčlenitev podaljševanja pričakovanega trajanja življenja ob rojstvu v 
posameznih starostnih razredih smo analizirali po prirejeni Pollardovi metodi. 
Znotraj posameznega starostnega razreda smo posamezni skupini glavnih vzrokov 
smrti (bolezni obtočil, novotvorbe, zunanji vzroki smrtnosti, bolezni dihal, 
bolezni prebavil) pripisali enak relativni vpliv na povišanje pričakovanega 
trajanja življenja, kot ga ima ta vzrok smrti na znižanje stopnje smrtnosti v 
tistem starostnem razredu. Potencialen prispevek posameznega vzroka smrti na 
podaljšanje pričakovanega trajanja življenja v prihodnosti smo analizirali s 
tablicami smrtnosti z izločenim posameznim vzrokom smrti. Ker je popolna 
izločitev posameznega vzroka smrti nerealistična, smo upoštevali tudi 
hipotetično prilagoditev stopenj smrtnosti na raven španije, ki ima najdaljše 
pričakovano trajanje življenja ob rojstvu v EU in je po dejavnikih tveganja za 
glavne skupine vzrokov smrti podobna Sloveniji.
UGOTOVITVE: V obdobju 1997-2014 je imelo največji vpliv na podaljševanje 
pričakovanega trajanja življenja zmanjševanje smrtnosti zaradi bolezni obtočil v 
starosti nad 60 let pri obeh spolih. Pri moških je mocno vplivala tudi nižja 
smrtnost zaradi novotvorb v starosti nad 50 let ter zaradi zunanjih vzrokov 
smrti v starosti med 20 in 50 let. Pri analizi potencialnega povišanja 
pričakovanega trajanja življenja smo ugotovili, da bi lahko največ pridobili z 
zniževanjem smrtnosti zaradi bolezni obtočil. Do podobnega sklepa pripelje 
prilagoditev stopenj smrtnosti v Sloveniji na ravni, ki jih ima španija. 
Pričakovano trajanje življenja ob rojstvu bi bilo v tem primeru višje za več kot 
2 leti, pri čemer bi največ razlike ponovno prispevali najvišji starostni 
razredi z nižjo smrtnostjo zaradi bolezni obtočil in novotvorb, precej pa tudi 
moški vseh starosti zaradi zunanjih vzrokov.
RAZPRAVA IN SKELP: Analiza pričakovanega trajanja življenja po vzrokih smrti in 
starosti omogoča z dokazi podprto odločanje o razporejanju resursov med različne 
preventivne programe in programe obvladovanja bolezni.

The overwhelming majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is not 
diagnosed until the cancer has metastasized, leading to an abysmal average life 
expectancy (3-6 months post-diagnosis). Earlier detection and more effective 
treatments have been hampered by inadequate understanding of the underlying 
molecular mechanisms controlling metastasis. We hypothesized that metastasis 
suppressors are involved in controlling metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Using 
an unbiased genome-wide shRNA screen, an shRNA library was transduced into the 
non-metastatic PDAC line S2-028 followed by intrasplenic injection. Resulting 
liver metastases were individually isolated from these mice. One liver 
metastatic nodule contained shRNA for ITIH5 (Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy 
chain 5), suggesting that ITIH5 may act as a metastasis suppressor. Consistent 
with this notion, metastatic PDAC cell lines had significantly lower protein 
expression of ITIH5 compared to immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cells 
and non-/poorly-metastatic PDAC cell lines. By manipulating expression of ITIH5 
in different PDAC cell lines (over-expression in metastatic, knockdown in 
non-metastatic) functional and selective regulation of metastasis was observed 
for ITIH5. Orthotopic tumor growth of PDAC cells was not blocked following 
orthotopic injection. In vitro ITIH5 over-expression inhibited motility and 
invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis of a human PDAC tissue microarray 
revealed that ITIH5 expression inversely correlated with both survival and 
invasion/metastasis. ITIH5 is, therefore, functionally validated as a PDAC 
metastasis suppressor and shows promise as a prognostic biomarker.

Packaging is associated with a high environmental impact. This is also the case 
in the food industry despite packaging being necessary for maintaining food 
quality, safety assurance and preventing food waste. The aim of the present 
study was to identify improvements in food packaging solutions able to minimize 
environmental externalities while maximizing the economic sustainability. To 
this end, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to evaluate 
the environmental performance of new packaging solutions. The environmental 
impact of packaging and food losses and the balance between the two were 
examined in relation to a cheesecake that is normally packaged in low density 
polyethylene film and has a limited shelf life due to microbial growth. A shelf 
life extension was sought via application of the well-established modified 
atmosphere packaging (MAP) technique. Samples for MAP (N2/CO2: 70/30) were 
placed inside multilayer gas barrier trays, which were then wrapped with a 
multilayer gas and water barrier film (i.e. AerPack packaging); control batches 
were packaged in gas barrier recycled polyethylene terephthalate (XrPet) trays 
and wrapped with a XrPet film. Samples were then stored at 20°C and inspected at 
regular intervals for chemical-physical, microbiological and sensory parameters. 
Results show that the new packaging solution could considerably extend the shelf 
life of cheesecakes, thereby reducing food waste and decreasing the overall 
environmental impact. Moreover, the new packaging allows one to minimize 
transport costs and to generate economies of scale in manufacturing.

and estimate current life expectancy.
SETTING: Two spinal centres in Great Britain.
METHODS: The sample consisted of patients with traumatic SCI injured 1943-2010 
who survived the first year post-injury, had residual neurological deficit on 
discharge and were British residents. Life expectancy and trends over time were 
estimated by neurological grouping, age and gender, using logistic regression of 
person-years of follow-up combined with standard life table calculations.
RESULTS: For the 5483 cases of traumatic SCI the mean age at injury was 35.1 
years, 79.7% were male, 31.1% had tetraplegia AIS/Frankel ABC, 41.2% paraplegia 
ABC,and 27.7% functionally incomplete lesion (all Ds). On 31 December 2014, 54% 
were still alive, 42.3% had died and 3.7% were lost to follow-up. Estimated life 
expectancies improved significantly between the 1950s and 1980s, plateaued 
during the next two decades, before slightly improving again since 2010. The 
estimated current life expectancy, compared with the general British population,
