Engineering enzyme catalytic properties is important for basic research as well 
as for biotechnological applications. We have previously shown that the 
reshaping of enzyme access tunnels via the deletion of a short surface loop 
element may yield a haloalkane dehalogenase variant with markedly modified 
substrate specificity and enantioselectivity. Here, we conversely probed the 
effects of surface loop-helix transplantation from one enzyme to another within 
the enzyme family of haloalkane dehalogenases. Precisely, we transplanted a 
nine-residue long extension of L9 loop and α4 helix from DbjA into the 
corresponding site of DbeA. Biophysical characterization showed that this 
fragment transplantation did not affect the overall protein fold or oligomeric 
state, but lowered protein stability (ΔT m = -5 to 6 °C). Interestingly, the 
crystal structure of DbeA mutant revealed the unique structural features of 
enzyme access tunnels, which are known determinants of catalytic properties for 
this enzyme family. Biochemical data confirmed that insertion increased activity 
of DbeA with various halogenated substrates and altered its enantioselectivity 
with several linear β-bromoalkanes. Our findings support a protein engineering 
strategy employing surface loop-helix transplantation for construction of novel 
protein catalysts with modified catalytic properties.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis using quality-adjusted life-years as the 
measure of health benefit is commonly used to aid decision-makers. Clinical 
studies often do not include preference-based measures that allow the 
calculation of quality-adjusted life-years, or the data are insufficient. 
'Mapping' can bridge this evidence gap; it entails estimating the relationship 
between outcomes measured in clinical studies and the required preference-based 
measures using a different data set. However, many methods for mapping yield 
biased results, distorting cost-effectiveness estimates.
OBJECTIVES: Develop existing and new methods for mapping; test their performance 
in case studies spanning different preference-based measures; and develop 
methods for mapping between preference-based measures.
DATA SOURCES: Fifteen data sets for mapping from non-preference-based measures 
to preference-based measures for patients with head injury, breast cancer, 
asthma, heart disease, knee surgery and varicose veins were used. Four 
preference-based measures were covered: the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions, three-level 
version (n = 11), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions, five-level version (n = 2), Short Form 
questionnaire-6 Dimensions (n = 1) and Health Utility Index Mark 3 (n = 1). 
Sample sizes ranged from 852 to 136,327. For mapping between generic 
preference-based measures, data from FORWARD, the National Databank for 
Rheumatic Diseases (which includes the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions, three-level 
version, and EuroQoL-5 Dimensions, five-level version, in its 2011 wave), were 
used.
MAIN METHODS DEVELOPED: Mixture-model-based approaches for direct mapping, in 
which the dependent variable is the health utility value, including adaptations 
of methods developed to model the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions, three-level version, and 
beta regression mixtures, were developed, as were indirect methods, in which 
responses to the descriptive systems are modelled, for consistent 
multidirectional mapping between preference-based measures. A highly flexible 
approach was designed, using copulas to specify the bivariate distribution of 
each pair of EuroQoL-5 Dimensions, three-level version, and EuroQoL-5 
Dimensions, five-level version, responses.
RESULTS: A range of criteria for assessing model performance is proposed. 
Theoretically, linear regression is inappropriate for mapping. Case studies 
confirm this. Flexible, direct mapping methods, based on different variants of 
mixture models with appropriate underlying distributions, perform very well for 
all preference-based measures. The precise form is important. Case studies show 
that a minimum of three components are required. Covariates representing disease 
severity are required as predictors of component membership. Beta-based mixtures 
perform similarly to the bespoke mixture approaches but necessitate detailed 
consideration of the number and location of probability masses. The flexible, 
bi-directional indirect approach performs well for testing differences between 
preference-based measures.
LIMITATIONS: Case studies drew heavily on EuroQoL-5 Dimensions. Indirect methods 
could not be undertaken for several case studies because of a lack of coverage. 
These methods will often be unfeasible for preference-based measures with 
complex descriptive systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Mapping requires appropriate methods to yield reliable results. 
Evidence shows that widely used methods such as linear regression are 
inappropriate. More flexible methods developed specifically for mapping show 
that close-fitting results can be achieved. Approaches based on mixture models 
are appropriate for all preference-based measures. Some features are universally 
required (such as the minimum number of components) but others must be assessed 
on a case-by-case basis (such as the location and number of probability mass 
points).
FUTURE RESEARCH PRIORITIES: Further research is recommended on (1) the use of 
the monotonicity concept, (2) the mismatch of trial and mapping distributions 
and measurement error and (3) the development of indirect methods drawing on 
methods developed for mapping between preference-based measures.

Plain Language Summary: Coherent decisions about which health services and 
treatments to provide rely on economic analysis to weigh potential health 
benefits against costs. For decisions to be consistent across the whole health 
service, benefits need to be counted in the same way for patients with different 
health problems. This is accomplished by using a unit of measurement for 
treatment outcomes called the quality-adjusted life-year. The best way to 
calculate quality-adjusted life-years is to ask patients taking part in clinical 
studies to fill in specially designed questionnaires to describe their health in 
a simple, standardised way. However, clinical trials often record patient 
outcomes in different ways, leaving economic analysts without the necessary 
information to calculate quality-adjusted life-years. A way to overcome this 
problem (known as ‘statistical mapping’) is to use the available clinical data 
to predict the responses that would have been made by trial participants to the 
standard questionnaire. This requires analysis of data from an additional study 
in which patients have provided both types of outcome data to construct a 
statistical ‘mapping model’. Mapping is widely used in practice, but it is often 
based on simple mapping models that in some circumstances systematically 
mispredict and may consequently give a false picture of the real health benefits 
of treatments. This is important because it influences decisions about which 
treatments are available in the NHS; it has real effects on patients, 
clinicians, industry and the general public. Our objectives are to develop 
promising new statistical mapping models specifically designed for different 
clinical contexts and to compare them using patient data in different disease 
areas. We have also developed an approach for judging the outcome of a mapping 
study. We find that the new methods work better than existing methods in terms 
of their ability to fit the data and avoid systematic bias.

The importance of semen leukocytes in HIV-1 transmission and the development of 
prevention strategies.

HIV-1 sexual transmission occurs mostly through contaminated semen, which is a 
complex mixture of soluble factors with immunoregulatory functions and cells. It 
is well established that semen cells from HIV-1-infected men are able to produce 
the virus and that are harnessed to efficiently interact with mucosal barriers 
exposed during sexual intercourse. Several cofactors contribute to semen 
infectivity and may enhance the risk of HIV-1 transmission to a partner by 
increasing local HIV-1 replication in the male genital tract, thereby increasing 
the number of HIV-1-infected cells and the local HIV-1 shedding in semen. The 
introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy has improved the life 
expectancy of HIV-1 infected individuals; however, there is evidence that 
systemic viral suppression does not always reflect full viral suppression in the 
seminal compartment. This review focus on the role semen leukocytes play in 
HIV-1 transmission and discusses implications of the increased resistance of 
cell-mediated transmission to immune-based prevention strategies.

OBJECTIVE: While advanced therapies for severe persistent pulmonary hypertension 
of the newborn (PPHN) such as inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are standard treatments in high-income countries, 
these therapies are often unavailable in resource-limited settings such as 
middle-income countries. However, there are small clinical trials illustrating 
the efficacy of sildenafil at reducing mortality in PPHN. This analysis sought 
to determine the cost-utility of enteral sildenafil for the treatment of severe 
PPHN.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov-state transition model was constructed for the two 
clinical approaches to compare costs, clinical outcomes, and quality of life: 
(1) "conventional," (2) "sildenafil." The impact of sildenafil was modeled as a 
relative risk modifier of the conventional strategy's mortality risk. 
Transitional probabilities, costs, and utility metrics were extracted from the 
literature. Sensitivity analyses for each model input as well as 100-patient 
Monte Carlo simulations were used to test the durability of the model 
conclusion.
RESULTS: The sildenafil strategy was cost-effective for upper but not lower 
middle-income countries with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2,339 
per quality-adjusted life year. This conclusion was durable across a wide-range 
of model assumptions; the sildenafil strategy only failed to meet criteria for 
cost-effectiveness when sildenafil therapy had a mortality relative risk 
efficacy of >0.89, if life expectancy in that country is <40 years, or if the 
lifetime forecasted costs of a survivor's life was quite high.
CONCLUSION: Enteral sildenafil is a cost-effective intervention for severe PPHN 
for upper middle-income countries where ECMO and iNO are not available.
KEY POINTS: · PPHN is a common life-threatening condition in newborns.. · 
Sildenafil improves survival of PPHN.. · Sildenafil is cost-effective for 
upper-middle income countries..

Cost-Effectiveness Framework?

BACKGROUND: Healthcare payers in the United States are increasingly tying 
provider payments to quality and value using pay-for-performance policies. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis quantifies value in healthcare but is not currently 
used to design or prioritize pay-for-performance strategies or metrics. Acute 
ischemic stroke care provides a useful application to demonstrate how simulation 
modeling can be used to determine cost-effective levels of financial incentives 
used in pay-for-performance policies and associated challenges with this 
approach.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Our framework requires a simulation model that can estimate 
quality-adjusted life years and costs resulting from improvements in a quality 
metric. A monetary level of incentives can then be back-calculated using the 
lifetime discounted quality-adjusted life year (which includes effectiveness of 
quality improvement) and cost (which includes incentive payments and cost 
offsets from quality improvements) outputs from the model. We applied this 
framework to an acute ischemic stroke microsimulation model to calculate the 
difference in population-level net monetary benefit (willingness-to-pay of 
$50 000 to $150 000/quality-adjusted life year) accrued under current Medicare 
policy (stroke payment not adjusted for performance) compared with various 
hypothetical pay-for-performance policies. Performance measurement was based on 
time-to-thrombolytic treatment with tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator). 
Compared with current payment, equivalent population-level net monetary benefit 
was achieved in pay-for-performance policies with 10-minute door-to-needle time 
reductions (5057 more acute ischemic stroke cases/y in the 0-3-hour window) 
incentivized by increasing tPA payment by as much as 18% to 44% depending on 
willingness-to-pay for health.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness modeling can be used to determine the upper 
bound of financial incentives used in pay-for-performance policies, although 
currently, this approach is limited due to data requirements and modeling 
assumptions. For tPA payments in acute ischemic stroke, our model-based results 
suggest financial incentives leading to a 10-minute decrease in door-to-needle 
time should be implemented but not exceed 18% to 44% of current tPA payment. In 
general, the optimal level of financial incentives will depend on 
willingness-to-pay for health and other modeling assumptions around parameter 
uncertainty and the relationship between quality improvements and long-run 
quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the national burden and trend of micronutrient 
deficiencies helps to guide effective intervention strategies under various 
circumstances. There is, however, a lack of evidence on trends, age- and 
sex-specific variations in Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide evidence on the trends of common 
micronutrient deficiencies including, dietary iron, iodine, vitamin A and other 
nutritional deficiencies in Ethiopia, from 1990 to 2017, using findings from the 
Global Burden of Disease study.
METHOD: We used estimates from the GBD 2017 study to report the incidence, 
prevalence and disability-adjusted life years of micronutrient deficiencies in 
Ethiopia from 1990 to 2017. All estimates, both crude counts, as well as all-age 
and age-standardized rates per 100,000 population, are accompanied by 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs). We summarized the age- and sex-specific patterns 
and we compared the burden with the sub-Saharan Africa and global estimate.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized prevalence rate of dietary 
iron, vitamin A and iodine deficiency decreased by 20.1%, 16.7%, and 91.6%, 
respectively. However, MNDs still account for a large number of DALYs in the 
country. In 2017, the all-age total DALYs due to dietary iron deficiency were 
estimated to be 448.4 thousand [95% UI: 298.9-640.7], accounting for 1.18% of 
the total DALYs. Similarly, the all-age total DALYs due to vitamin A deficiency 
were 397.8 thousand [256.1-589.2]. The total DALYs due to iodine deficiency were 
estimated to be 89.6 thousand [48.3-155.4].
CONCLUSIONS: Micronutrient deficiencies and associated morbidity and mortality 
are still high in Ethiopia compared with the sub-Saharan and global estimate. 
Adolescent and early adult females and children aged under-five are 
disproportionately affected segments of the population. Therefore, in 
collaboration with other sectors, the National Nutrition Program needs to place 
greater emphasis upon improving accessibility and utilization of nutrient-rich 
foods and supplementation, particularly for vulnerable groups of the population.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe return to work determinants in 
patients with haematological malignancy.
RESULTS: This medico-social pilot study included patients with haematological 
malignancy in the département of Calvados, aged 18 to 55 years, diagnosed 
between 1st January and 31st December 2010 and alive at 1st January 2015. 
Patients were identified via consultation of the Lower Normandy haematological 
malignancy Registry. They completed a specially developed self-questionnaire, in 
addition to validated questionnaires for anxiety-depression, quality of life and 
fatigue. Of the patients contacted, 50% accepted to participate. The mean age at 
diagnosis was 49.8 years, and the majority of patients (79.2%) was 
professionally active at the time of diagnosis. Only 64.9% of subjects had 
stopped work due to illness. The psychological impact (demonstrated anxiety) was 
significantly greater in men (p = 0.01). The majority of subjects returned to 
work after treatment (80.7%) and among them, the mean duration of absence from 
work was 16.1 months. Only 52.6% of subjects had informed their occupational 
physician and 56.7% had benefited from a pre-return visit. The satisfactory 
response rate obtained is promising for the extension of the present project as 
a prospective multicentric study.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy but also healthspan seems inaccessible as 
of yet but it may become a reality in the foreseeable future. To extend 
lifespan, it is essential to unveil molecular mechanisms involved in ageing. As 
for healthspan, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in age-related 
pathologies is crucial.
MAIN BODY: We focus on the epigenetic side of ageing as ageing is traced by 
specific epigenetic patterns and can be measured by epigenetic clocks. We 
discuss to what extent exposure to environmental factor, such as alcohol use, 
unhealthy diet, tobacco and stress, promotes age-related conditions. We focused 
on inflammation, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we discuss strategies 
to reverse time based on epigenetic reprogramming.
CONCLUSIONS: Reversibility of the epigenetic marks makes them promising targets 
for rejuvenation. For this purpose, a better understanding of the epigenetic 
mechanisms underlying ageing is essential. Epigenetic clocks were successfully 
designed to monitor these mechanisms and the influence of environmental factors. 
Further studies on age-related diseases should be conducted to determine their 
epigenetic signature, but also to pinpoint the defect in the epigenetic 
machinery and thereby identify potential therapeutic targets. As for 
rejuvenation, epigenetic reprogramming is still at an early stage.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and 
reduces life expectancy. Achieving and sustaining remission from depression is 
challenging after initial improvement of an acute episode with an 
antidepressant, especially for patients whose depressive episodes have proven 
treatment-resistant in response to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy. 
While standard antidepressants are at least partly effective for the short-term 
treatment of acute depressive episodes of MDD, many patients relapse within 6 
months of apparent clinical remission, with faster and higher rates observed in 
those with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Efficacy of IV ketamine, a 
rapid-acting N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, in maintaining 
antidepressant effect was suggested in a few small, single center, open-label 
studies and case series. More recently, maintenance of antidepressant effects 
beyond the initial acute (induction) treatment period has been shown with 
esketamine nasal spray, an enantiomer of ketamine, in conjunction with an oral 
antidepressant in three phase 2/3 registration studies (SYNAPSE, SUSTAIN-1, 
SUSTAIN-2) of adult patients with TRD. In these studies the maintenance of 
efficacy of an intermittently-dosed esketamine treatment regimen was established 
in which twice-weekly dose administration during a 4-week induction period was 
followed initially by weekly administration and later by either weekly or 
every-other-week administration. During long-term maintenance therapy the 
antidepressant effect persisted in most patients with this regimen, despite 
their history of being resistant to conventional antidepressants prior to 
entering esketamine studies. These data suggest that the neurobiological changes 
induced by initial esketamine treatment, which putatively underlie its 
antidepressant effect, can be maintained using repeated administration.

The plant hormone auxin is essential for plant growth and development. YUCCA 
proteins catalyse the rate-limiting step for endogenous auxin biosynthesis. In 
this study, we isolated 20 MdYUCCA genes from apple genome. MdYUCCA6a, 
MdYUCCA8a, and MdYUCCA10a were expressed in most organs and could support whole 
plant basal auxin synthesis. MdYUCCA4a, MdYUCCA10b, and MdYUCCA11a expression 
indicated roles for these genes in auxin biosynthesis in vegetative organs. 
MdYUCCA2b, MdYUCCA11b, and MdYUCCA11d were mainly expressed in flower organs. 
High temperature induced the expression of MdYUCCA4a, MdYUCCA6a, MdYUCCA8a, and 
MdYUCCA10a, and down-regulated the expression of MdYUCCA2b and MdYUCCA6b. 
Dual-luciferase assay indicated that MdPIF4 could trans-activate the MdYUCCA8a 
promoter. Overexpression of MdYUCCA8a increased IAA content, increased stem 
height, enhanced apical dominance, and led to silique malformation. These 
results provide a foundation for further investigation of the biological 
functions of apple MdYUCCAs.

PURPOSE: The teeth positioning may be an important associated factor for the 
pericoronitis' clinical signs. Our objective was to verify the association 
between lower third molar position according to the Pell and Gregory 
classification and clinical variables in patients with pericoronitis.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of panoramic radiographs and medical records 
of patients with pericoronitis. Primary outcomes: pain and oral health-related 
quality of life (OHRQoL); secondary outcomes: mouth opening, edema/erythema 
extension, visible plaque index, bleeding on probing index, periodontal pocket 
probing depth, and distal alveolar bone crest height of the adjacent second 
molar.
RESULTS: The edema/erythema extension was higher in the IIA position compared 
with the IA position (p = 0.03). Regarding the OHRQoL, the OHIP-14 score was 
21.0 (± 9.26, range from 4 to 44). The most scored domain was physical pain 
(5.24), followed by psychological discomfort (4.43). Third molars in IIA 
position are associated with worse OHRQoL than IB and IIB positions (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a higher extension of edema/erythema and worse OHRQoL 
when the third molar was in IIA position. Prophylactic removal of mandibular 
third molar in position IIA may avoid the onset of mucosal edema/erythema and 
prevent pericoronitis from promoting impairment of individuals' quality of life.

PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant 
tumors. Inflammatory and hematological parameters such as neutrophil/lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) provided useful information 
especially in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of malignancies. In this 
study, we planned to demonstrate the efficacy of NLR and PLR levels in the 
evaluation of the prognosis of patients with HCC in our clinic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was planned as a prospective observational 
cohort study. The study included 105 patients with HCC on the base of cirrhosis. 
Our study group was classified according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
(BCLC), Okuda staging system, and Milan criteria at the time of admission.
RESULTS: The mean age of all cases was 60.6 ± 12.4 years, and 77 (73.3%) of the 
patients were male. The mean life expectancy of all patients was 
7.7 ± 4.3 months. During 1-year follow-up, 61 (58.1%) HCC patients died. The 
mean survival of the patients who died was 4.6 ± 3.0 months. In our study, 
patients with NLR > 2.7, patients with PLR > 100.29, BCLC advanced stage, and 
Okuda advanced stage, and patients who did not meet the Milan criteria had 
shorter survival duration. NLR > 2.7, BCLC advanced stage, and Child C were 
determined as independent risk factors affecting mortality.
CONCLUSION: There was a strong correlation between NLR-PLR levels and mortality. 
PLR and NLR levels can be used in conjunction with other staging systems to 
regulate, monitor, and predict the survival of HCC patients.

Community-wide administration of antimalarial drugs in therapeutic doses is a 
potential tool to prevent malaria infection and reduce the malaria parasite 
reservoir. To measure the effectiveness and cost of using the antimalarial drug 
combination dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAp) through different 
community-wide distribution strategies, Zambia's National Malaria Control Centre 
conducted a three-armed community-randomized controlled trial. The trial arms 
were as follows: 1) standard of care (SoC) malaria interventions, 2) SoC plus 
focal mass drug administration (fMDA), and 3) SoC plus MDA. Mass drug 
administration consisted of offering all eligible individuals DHAP, irrespective 
of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) result. Focal mass drug administration 
consisted of offering DHAP to all eligible individuals who resided in a 
household where anyone tested positive by RDT. Results indicate that the costs 
of fMDA and MDA per person targeted and reached are similar (US$9.01 versus 
US$8.49 per person, respectively, P = 0.87), but that MDA was superior in all 
cost-effectiveness measures, including cost per infection averted, cost per case 
averted, cost per death averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life year 
averted. Subsequent costing of the MDA intervention in a non-trial, operational 
setting yielded significantly lower costs per person reached (US$2.90). Mass 
drug administration with DHAp also met the WHO thresholds for "cost-effective 
interventions" in the Zambian setting in 90% of simulations conducted using a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on trial costs, whereas fMDA met these 
criteria in approximately 50% of simulations. A sensitivity analysis using costs 
from operational deployment and trial effectiveness yielded improved 
cost-effectiveness estimates. Mass drug administration may be a cost-effective 
intervention in the Zambian context and can help reduce the parasite reservoir 
substantially. Mass drug administration was more cost-effective in relatively 
higher transmission settings. In all scenarios examined, the cost-effectiveness 
of MDA was superior to that of fMDA.

A cost-utility analysis in the current issue of AJG examines the ramifications 
of the overuse of surveillance endoscopy in Barrett's esophagus (BE). This study 
suggests that excess surveillance is expensive, increasing costs by 50% or more, 
with only nominal increases in quality-adjusted life expectancy. This study 
joins a growing literature of cost-utility analyses that suggest that more is 
not likely better when it comes to surveillance endoscopy. Given the plentiful 
literature showing overutilization of surveillance endoscopy in BE, the authors 
argue for a focus on the quality of endoscopy rather than increased frequency of 
surveillance to improve returns on our healthcare investment.

BACKGROUND: Retirement ages are rising in many countries to offset the 
challenges of population ageing, but people's capacity to work for more years in 
their later working life (>50 years) is unclear. We aimed to estimate healthy 
working life expectancy in England.
METHODS: This analysis included adults aged 50 years and older from six waves 
(2002-13) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), with linked 
mortality data. Healthy working life expectancy was defined as the average 
number of years expected to be spent healthy (no limiting long-standing illness) 
and in paid work (employment or self-employment) from age 50 years. Healthy 
working life expectancy was estimated for England overall and stratified by sex, 
educational attainment, deprivation level, occupation type, and region by use of 
interpolated Markov chain multi-state modelling.
FINDINGS: There were 15 284 respondents (7025 men and 8259 women) with survey 
and mortality data for the study period. Healthy working life expectancy at age 
50 years was on average 9·42 years (10·94 years [95% CI 10·65-11·23] for men and 
8·25 years [7·92-8·58] for women) and life expectancy was 31·76 years (30·05 
years for men and 33·49 years for women). The number of years expected to be 
spent unhealthy and in work from age 50 years was 1·84 years (95% CI 1·74-1·94) 
in England overall. Population subgroups with the longest healthy working life 
expectancy were the self-employed (11·76 years [95% CI 10·76-12·76]) or those 
with non-manual occupations (10·32 years [9·95-10·69]), those with a tertiary 
education (11·27 years [10·74-11·80]), those living in southern England (10·73 
years [10·16-11·30] in the South East and 10·51 years [9·80-11·22] in the South 
West), and those living in the least deprived areas (10·53 years [10·06-10·99]).
INTERPRETATION: Healthy working life expectancy at age 50 years in England is 
below the remaining years to State Pension age. Older workers of lower 
socioeconomic status and in particular regions in England might benefit from 
proactive approaches to improve health, workplace environments, and job 
opportunities to improve their healthy working life expectancy. Continued 
monitoring of healthy working life expectancy would provide further examination 
of the success of such approaches and that of policies to extend working lives.

All mammals progress through similar physiological stages throughout life, from 
early development to puberty, aging, and death. Yet, the extent to which this 
conserved physiology reflects underlying genomic events is unclear. Here, we map 
the common methylation changes experienced by mammalian genomes as they age, 
focusing on comparison of humans with dogs, an emerging model of aging. Using 
oligo-capture sequencing, we characterize methylomes of 104 Labrador retrievers 
spanning a 16-year age range, achieving >150× coverage within mammalian syntenic 
blocks. Comparison with human methylomes reveals a nonlinear relationship that 
translates dog-to-human years and aligns the timing of major physiological 
milestones between the two species, with extension to mice. Conserved changes 
center on developmental gene networks, which are sufficient to translate age and 
the effects of anti-aging interventions across multiple mammals. These results 
establish methylation not only as a diagnostic age readout but also as a 
cross-species translator of physiological aging milestones.

Water bamboo shoots quickly deteriorate after harvest as a result of rapid 
lignification and softening. Nitric oxide (NO) has been used to extend the 
postharvest life of several other vegetables. Here, we examined the effect of NO 
on the storage of water bamboo shoots at 4℃ for 28 days. Without NO, fresh 
weight and firmness decreased quickly, while the cellulose and lignin contents 
increased sharply during storage. NO treatment delayed softening by maintaining 
the integrity of the cell wall and inhibiting the degradation of protopectin and 
the expressions of pectin methylesterase and polygalacturonase. NO treatment 
also delayed cellulose synthesis by increasing cellulase activity. NO treatment 
decreased the synthesis of lignin by inhibiting the activities of phenylalanine 
ammonia-lyase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, laccase and peroxidase. These 
results indicate that NO treatment is effective at suppressing the softening and 
lignification of water bamboo shoots during postharvest storage.

AIMS: Obinutuzumab (GA101; G) is a new treatment for follicular lymphoma (FL) 
that is anticipated to have greater efficacy than the current treatment, 
rituximab (R). The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of G 
plus chemotherapy (G + Chemo) against that of R plus chemotherapy (R + Chemo) 
for patients in Japan with previously untreated FL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We localized a previously reported cost-effectiveness 
model using the Japanese cost data. For estimating costs adapted in the model, 
FL patients treated with R were identified from Japanese hospital-based claims 
database and classified into three treatment regimen groups according to 
chemotherapies used with R: CHOP, CVP, and bendamustine (B). Based on services 
per patient and cost items, parameters determining the cost amounts were derived 
using a multivariate generalized linear mixed model to estimate the direct 
medical costs for each treatment regimen group for G and R. For the utility, 
same values in the previous model were used. Lifetime cost and quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) were estimated under the payer's perspective.
RESULTS: The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in million 
JPY per QALY for G-CHOP vs. R-CHOP, G-CVP vs. R-CVP, and G-B vs. R-B were 5.4, 
4.3, and 4.8, respectively. ICERs were lower than 7.5 million JPY per QALY, 
which is the cost-effectiveness threshold for cancer treatments, and showed that 
G + Chemo is a cost-effective treatment regimen for Japanese patients with 
previously untreated FL. Lifetime direct medical costs were lowest in the R-B 
group because hospitalization costs that accounted for most of the total cost 
were lowest in this group. Limitations and conclusions: The cost-effectiveness 
of G + Chemo is acceptable in Japan. Differences in the direct medical costs 
among treatment regimen groups were mostly due to hospitalization costs. This is 
probably because many Japanese hematologists choose inpatient treatments over 
outpatient treatments in CHOP-based induction therapy.

BACKGROUND: Locomotive syndrome (LoS) is defined as the loss of mobility due to 
age-related impairment of motor organs. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the prevalence and severity of LoS, muscular strength and balancing 
ability, and prevalence of sarcopenia in relation to the presence of LoS 
according to sex and age groups ranging between 50 and 89 years.
METHODS: Male and female participants between the ages of 50-89 were randomly 
selected in the resident registry of a cooperating town. Calls for participation 
continued until approximately 50 consenting participants were successfully 
recruited for each age group and sex. A total of 413 participants (203 male and 
210 female) were enrolled for undergoing a LoS risk test and measuring their 
physical function. Physical function was compared to participants with or 
without LoS.
RESULTS: A total of 312 patients (75.5%) were diagnosed as LoS, of which 144 
(46.2%) were male and 168 (53.8%) were female. The severity of LoS for the 312 
patients were 210 (67.3%) for stage 1 and 102 (32.7%) for stage 2. The 
prevalence of LoS in males were 37, 59, 91, and 100% in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 
80s age strata, respectively. The prevalence of LoS in females were 71, 62, 89, 
and 98% in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s age strata, respectively. The prevalence 
of sarcopenia was significantly higher as the age strata in males grew higher. 
Knee extension strength was significantly lower for participants in their 50s 
and females in addition to females in their 60s with LoS. The 31 patients 
diagnosed as sarcopenia included 29 (93.5%) with LoS, 11 (35.4%) classified as 
LoS stage 1, and 18 (58.1%) classified as stage 2.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LoS was high in participants over 70 years of 
age. In males, the prevalence of sarcopenia was higher as the age strata grew 
higher. Patients with LoS exhibited lower knee extension strength. We believe 
that some measures to prevent or improve LoS may require exercise to increase 
the muscle strength of the lower limbs.
