BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested a reduced life expectancy in patients 
with Crohn's disease (CD) compared with the general population. The evidence, 
however, is inconsistent.
AIMS: Prompted by such studies, we studied survival of CD patients in Örebro 
county, Sweden.
METHODS: From the medical records, we identified all patients diagnosed with CD 
during 1963-2010 with follow-up to the end of 2011. We estimated: overall 
survival, net and crude probabilities of dying from CD, relative survival ratio 
(RSR), and excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) at 10-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The study included 492 patients (226 males, 266 females). Median age at 
diagnosis was 32 years (3-87). Net and crude probabilities of dying from CD 
increased with increasing age and were higher for women. Net survival of 
patients aged ≥60 at diagnosis was worse for patients diagnosed during 1963-1985 
(54%) than for patients diagnosed during 1986-1999 (88%) or 2000-2010 (93%). 
Overall, CD patients' survival was comparable to that in the general population 
[RSR = 0.98; 95% CI: (0.95-1.00)]. However, significantly lower than expected 
survival was suggested for female patients aged ≥60 diagnosed during the 
1963-1985 [RSR = 0.47 (0.07-0.95)]. The adjusted model suggested that, compared 
with diagnostic period 1963-1985, disease-related excess mortality declined 
during 2000-2010 [EMRR = 0.36 (0.07-1.96)]; and age ≥60 at diagnosis [EMRR = 
7.99 (1.64-39.00), reference: age 40-59], female sex [EMRR = 4.16 (0.62-27.85)], 
colonic localization [EMRR = 4.20 (0.81-21.88), reference: ileal localization], 
and stricturing/penetrating disease [EMRR = 2.56 (0.52-12.58), reference: 
inflammatory disease behaviour] were associated with poorer survival.
CONCLUSION: CD-related excess mortality may vary with diagnostic period, age, 
sex and disease phenotype.Key summaryThere is inconsistent evidence on life 
expectancy of patients with Crohn's diseaseCrohn's disease-specific survival 
improved over time.Earlier diagnosis period, older age at diagnosis, female sex, 
colonic disease and complicated disease behaviour seems to be associated with 
excess Crohn's disease-related mortality.

The rollout of antiretroviral therapy globally has increased life expectancy 
across Southern Africa, where 20.6 million people now live with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We aimed to determine the prevalence of 
age-related osteoporosis and sarcopenia, and investigate the association between 
HIV, bone mineral density (BMD), muscle strength and lean mass, and gait speed. 
A cross-sectional community-based study of individuals aged 20-80 years in rural 
South Africa collected demographic and clinical data, including HIV status, grip 
strength, gait speed, body composition, and BMD. Sarcopenia was defined by the 
European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) guidelines, and 
osteoporosis as BMD T-score ≤ -2.5 (if age ≥50 years). The mean ± standard 
deviation (SD) age of 805 black South African participants was 44.6 
± 14.8 years, 547 (68.2%) were female; 34 (13.2%) were men, and 129 (23.6%) 
women had HIV, with 88% overall taking anti-retroviral therapy. A femoral neck 
T-score ≤ -2.5, seen in four of 95 (4.2%) men and 39 of 201 (19.4%) women age 
≥50 years, was more common in women with than without HIV (13/35 [37.1%] versus 
26/166 [15.7%]; p = 0.003). Although no participant had confirmed sarcopenia, 
probable sarcopenia affected more men than women (30/258 [11.6%] versus 24/547 
[4.4%]; p = .001]. Although appendicular lean mass (ALM)/height2 index was lower 
in both men and women with HIV, there were no differences in grip strength, gait 
speed, or probable sarcopenia by HIV status. Older age, female sex, lower 
ALM/height2 index, slower gait speed, and HIV infection were all independently 
associated with lower femoral neck BMD. In conclusion, osteoporosis rather than 
sarcopenia is the common musculoskeletal disease of aging in rural South Africa; 
older women with HIV may experience greater bone losses than women without HIV. 
Findings raise concerns over future fracture risk in Southern Africa, where HIV 
clinics should consider routine bone health assessment, particularly in aging 
women. © 2021 The Authors. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research published by

BACKGROUND: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare disorder 
characterized by premature aging and death mainly because of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or heart failure. The disease is provoked by progerin, a 
variant of lamin A expressed in most differentiated cells. Patients look healthy 
at birth, and symptoms typically emerge in the first or second year of life. 
Assessing the reversibility of progerin-induced damage and the relative 
contribution of specific cell types is critical to determining the potential 
benefits of late treatment and to developing new therapies.
METHODS: We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate LmnaHGPSrev/HGPSrev 
(HGPSrev) mice engineered to ubiquitously express progerin while lacking lamin A 
and allowing progerin suppression and lamin A restoration in a time- and cell 
type-specific manner on Cre recombinase activation. We characterized the 
phenotype of HGPSrev mice and crossed them with Cre transgenic lines to assess 
the effects of suppressing progerin and restoring lamin A ubiquitously at 
different disease stages as well as specifically in vascular smooth muscle cells 
and cardiomyocytes.
RESULTS: Like patients with HGPS, HGPSrev mice appear healthy at birth and 
progressively develop HGPS symptoms, including failure to thrive, lipodystrophy, 
vascular smooth muscle cell loss, vascular fibrosis, electrocardiographic 
anomalies, and precocious death (median lifespan of 15 months versus 26 months 
in wild-type controls, P<0.0001). Ubiquitous progerin suppression and lamin A 
restoration significantly extended lifespan when induced in 6-month-old mildly 
symptomatic mice and even in severely ill animals aged 13 months, although the 
benefit was much more pronounced on early intervention (84.5% lifespan extension 
in mildly symptomatic mice, P<0.0001, and 6.7% in severely ill mice, P<0.01). It 
is remarkable that major vascular alterations were prevented and lifespan 
normalized in HGPSrev mice when progerin suppression and lamin A restoration 
were restricted to vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: HGPSrev mice constitute a new experimental model for advancing 
knowledge of HGPS. Our findings suggest that it is never too late to treat HGPS, 
although benefit is much more pronounced when progerin is targeted in mice with 
mild symptoms. Despite the broad expression pattern of progerin and its 
deleterious effects in many organs, restricting its suppression to vascular 
smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes is sufficient to prevent vascular disease 
and normalize lifespan.

Metaparametric Neural Networks for Survival Analysis.

De Mello FL, Wilkinson JM, Kadirkamanathan V.

Survival analysis is a critical tool for the modeling of time-to-event data, 
such as life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis or optimal maintenance 
scheduling for complex machinery. However, current neural network models provide 
an imperfect solution for survival analysis as they either restrict the shape of 
the target probability distribution or restrict the estimation to predetermined 
times. As a consequence, current survival neural networks lack the ability to 
estimate a generic function without prior knowledge of its structure. In this 
article, we present the metaparametric neural network framework that encompasses 
the existing survival analysis methods and enables their extension to solve the 
aforementioned issues. This framework allows survival neural networks to satisfy 
the same independence of generic function estimation from the underlying data 
structure that characterizes their regression and classification counterparts. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the metaparametric framework 
using both simulated and large real-world datasets and show that it outperforms 
the current state-of-the-art methods in: 1) capturing nonlinearities and 2) 
identifying temporal patterns, leading to more accurate overall estimations 
while placing no restrictions on the underlying function structure.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia aims to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by 2020, through a 
dual approach of mass drug administration to interrupt transmission and 
morbidity control which includes making hydrocele surgery available in all 
endemic areas. Locating patients requiring surgery, providing high quality 
surgeries, and following up patients are all formidable challenges for many 
resource-challenged or difficult-to-reach communities. To date, hydrocele 
surgery in Ethiopia has only occurred when a patient has the knowledge, time and 
resources to travel to regional hospitals. Ethiopia tested the novel approach of 
using a surgical camp, defined as mobilizing, transporting, providing surgery at 
a static site, and following up of a large cohort of hydrocele patients within a 
hospital's catchment area, to address delays in seeking and receiving care.
METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Health extension workers mobilized 252 patients with 
scrotal swelling from a list of 385 suspected hydrocele cases from seven endemic 
districts in the region of Beneshangul-Gumuz. Clinical health workers and 
surgeons confirmed 119 as eligible for surgery. Of 70 additional patients who 
self-referred, 56 were eligible for surgery. Over a two-week period at a 
regional hospital, 175 hydrocele excision surgeries were conducted. After 
discharge three days after surgery, trained clinical health workers followed up 
with the patients on Day 5, Day 8, Day 14 and 1st-month benchmarks with a 
randomized follow-up of a selection of patients conducted at 9-12 months. There 
were no post-operative complications upon discharge at Day 3 and 22, while minor 
complications occurred (12.6%) between Day 3 and one month. The 9-12 month 
follow-up found patients self-reported an improvement in quality of life, health 
and economic status.
CONCLUSION: A hydrocele surgery camp was effective at providing a large number 
of quality surgeries in a short time. Using peripheral health workers to 
mobilize and follow up patients helped address delays in seeking and receiving 
quality care. Mainstreaming patient mobilization and follow-up into a community 
health system could be effective in other countries. The camp's results also 
influenced two regions in Ethiopia to change their policies in order to offer 
free hydrocele surgery (including patient transport, consultation, surgery, 
diagnostic tests and necessary medications).

40 years ago, Italy saw the birth of a national, universal health-care system 
(Servizio Sanitario Nazionale [SSN]), which provides a full range of health-care 
services with a free choice of providers. The SSN is consistently rated within 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development among the highest 
countries for life expectancy and among the lowest in health-care spending as a 
proportion of gross domestic product. Italy appears to be in an envious 
position. However, a rapidly ageing population, increasing prevalence of chronic 
diseases, rising demand, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed weaknesses in 
the system. These weaknesses are linked to the often tumultuous history of the 
nation and the health-care system, in which innovation and initiative often lead 
to spiralling costs and difficulties, followed by austere cost-containment 
measures. We describe how the tenuous balance of centralised versus regional 
control has shifted over time to create not one, but 20 different health 
systems, exacerbating differences in access to care across regions. We explore 
how Italy can rise to the challenges ahead, providing recommendations for 
systemic change, with emphasis on data-driven planning, prevention, and 
research; integrated care and technology; and investments in personnel. The 
evolution of the SSN is characterised by an ongoing struggle to balance 
centralisation and decentralisation in a health-care system, a dilemma faced by 
many nations. If in times of emergency, planning, coordination, and control by 
the central government can guarantee uniformity of provider behaviour and access 
to care, during non-emergency times, we believe that a balance can be found 
provided that autonomy is paired with accountability in achieving certain 
objectives, and that the central government develops the skills and, therefore, 
the legitimacy, to formulate health policies of a national nature. These 
processes would provide local governments with the strategic means to develop 
local plans and programmes, and the knowledge and tools to coordinate local 
initiatives for eventual transfer to the larger system.

Advances in antiretroviral treatment improved the life expectancy of perinatally 
HIV-infected children. However, growing up with HIV provides challenges in daily 
functioning. This cross-sectional cohort study investigated the 
neuropsychological and psychosocial functioning of a group of perinatally 
HIV-infected children in the Netherlands and compared their outcomes with Dutch 
normative data and outcomes of a control group of uninfected siblings. The 
children's functioning was assessed with internationally well-known and 
standardized questionnaires, using a multi-informant approach, including the 
perspectives of caregivers, teachers, and school-aged children. In addition, we 
explored the associations of socio-demographic and medical characteristics of 
the HIV-infected children with their neuropsychological and psychosocial 
functioning. Caregivers reported compromised functioning when compared to Dutch 
normative data for HIV-infected children in the areas of attention, sensory 
processing, social-emotional functioning, and health-related quality of life. 
Teachers reported in addition compromised executive functioning for HIV-infected 
children. A comparison with siblings revealed differences in executive 
functioning, problems with peers, and general health. The concurrent resemblance 
between HIV-infected children and siblings regarding problems in other domains 
implies that social and contextual factors may be of influence. A family-focused 
approach with special attention to the child's socio-environmental context and 
additional attention for siblings is recommended.

The early diagnosis of diseases plays a vital role in healthcare and the 
extension of human life. Graphene-based biosensors have boosted the early 
diagnosis of diseases by detecting and monitoring related biomarkers, providing 
a better understanding of various physiological and pathological processes. They 
have generated tremendous interest, made significant advances, and offered 
promising application prospects. In this paper, we discuss the background of 
graphene and biosensors, including the properties and functionalization of 
graphene and biosensors. Second, the significant technologies adopted by 
biosensors are discussed, such as field-effect transistors and electrochemical 
and optical methods. Subsequently, we highlight biosensors for detecting various 
biomarkers, including ions, small molecules, macromolecules, viruses, bacteria, 
and living human cells. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of 
graphene-based biosensors and related broad research interests are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Demographic changes are leading to an ageing population in Europe. 
People are becoming more dependent on digital technologies and health ministries 
invest increasingly in digitalisation. Societal digital demands impact older 
people and learning to use new telehealth systems and digital devices are seen 
as a means of securing their needs.
METHODS: The present study undertakes a scoping review in order to map relevant 
evidence about telehealth and digital developments in society involving citizens 
aged 75 and over in European countries. It focuses on their experiences and the 
main barriers to, and facilitators of, societal digital demands. A framework 
proposed by Arksey and O`Malley was used to guide the scoping review process. 
The studies included in the review covered telehealth, digital technology and 
digital devices, and the context covered participants` own home or surroundings. 
A comprehensive search on PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase and Open Grey 
was undertaken.
RESULTS: Out of 727 identified citations, 13 sources which met the inclusion 
criteria (9 original study articles, 2 theses, 1 letter about a product and 1 
project report). Few of the studies identified have investigated European 
citizens 75 years and older separately. The studies included varied in their 
design, location and focus. Older people have experienced both telehealth and 
digital devices making life easier and the opposite. The outstanding facilitator 
found was that technology should be easy to use, and difficulty in remembering 
the instructions was seen as an important barrier. Interestingly, both social 
support and lack of social support were found as facilitators of using new 
devices.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth may give a sense of security but learning to use a new 
device often takes extra effort. Older people were more open to new devices if 
the possible advantages of the new technology outweighed the effort that would 
be involved in adopting a new strategy. As technology develops rapidly, and life 
expectancy in Europe is anticipated to rise continually, there is a need for new 
and additional research among older European citizens. Future research should 
cover the technical solutions most relevant to older people today, social 
support and participants` access to the devices.

This study aims to address the economic, social, and environmental wellbeing 
issues simultaneously by measuring the carbon intensity of wellbeing (CIWB) of 
Asian economies employing Prais-Winsten and pooled OLS estimator. The measure of 
CIWB is made taking into account a ratio of the two indicators-CO2 emissions per 
capita and life expectancy at birth. There is a paucity of studies that 
concentrate on human and social wellbeing indicators (i.e., water, sanitation, 
life expectancy) together applying the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) 
hypothesis. Therefore, we have also investigated the EKC hypothesis as this 
theory hypothesizes the link involving human and environmental wellbeing and 
development. The findings utilizing the two econometric techniques indicate that 
in both the estimation models urban population access to an improved water 
source and total population access to improved water source has consistently 
negative and significant effects on CIWB. The fertility rate and prevalence of 
HIV pose no threat to CIWB. These findings demonstrate that social and human 
wellbeing indicators of the Asian economies are sustainable to this moment as 
they are lowering CIWB which is desirable. Contrary, GDP per capita, exports as 
a percent of GDP, and urban population have a significant and positive impact on 
CIWB which poses a challenge for the sustainability issue. We also have found 
the existence of the EKC hypothesis indicating environmental quality will 
increase past a turning point. The findings of the paper are well matched with 
the view of the "Economic and ecological modernization" theory and "human 
ecology" theory.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The supply-side threshold for the UK National Health 
Service has been empirically estimated as the marginal returns to healthcare 
spending on health outcomes. These estimates implicitly exclude future 
healthcare costs, which is inconsistent with the objective of making the most 
efficient use of healthcare resources. This paper illustrates how empirical 
estimates of the threshold within healthcare can be adjusted to account for 
future healthcare costs.
METHODS: Using cause-deleted life tables and previous work on future costs in 
England and Wales, we illustrate how such estimates can be adjusted.
RESULTS: While the effect of including future healthcare costs can have 
substantial effects on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of specific 
life-extending interventions, we find that including future costs has relatively 
little impact (an increase of £743 per quality-adjusted life-year) on the 
threshold estimate.
CONCLUSIONS: For some life-extending interventions the impact of including 
future costs on whether an intervention is deemed cost effective may be 
considerable.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Orphan drugs' high prices raise questions about 
whether their costs are worth their benefits. We examined the association 
between an orphan drug's cost-effectiveness and health plan coverage 
restrictiveness.
METHODS: We analyzed a dataset of US commercial health plan coverage decisions 
(information current as of 2019) for orphan drugs (n = 3298). We used 
multi-level random-effect logistic regression to examine the association between 
orphan drug cost-effectiveness and coverage restrictiveness. We identified 
cost-effectiveness estimates from the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis Registry, and from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review's 
value assessments. We included only cost-effectiveness studies not funded by 
product manufacturers. We included the following independent variables: cancer 
indication, availability of alternatives, pediatric population, number of years 
since US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, disease prevalence, annual 
cost, additional non-orphan indication, safety, and inclusion in a FDA expedited 
review program.
RESULTS: Plans restricted drug coverage in 29.7% (n = 981) of decisions. Plans 
were more likely to restrict drugs with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 
$50,000-$175,000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] (odds ratio = 1.855, p < 
0.05), $175,000-$500,000 per QALY (odds ratio = 1.859, p < 0.05), and >$500,000 
per QALY/dominated (odds ratio = 2.032, p < 0.01), compared to drugs with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios <$50,000 per QALY. Plans more often 
restricted drugs with non-cancer indications, having available alternatives, 
with more recent approval, in an FDA expedited review program, and for which the 
FDA additionally issued approval for a non-orphan disease. Plans more often 
restricted drugs with higher annual costs, and drugs indicated for higher 
prevalence diseases. All findings p < 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: Among other factors, an orphan drug's cost-effectiveness was 
associated with health plan drug coverage restrictiveness.

OBJECTIVE: For patients who are discharged to go home after a hospitalisation, 
timely and adequately informing their general practitioner is important for 
continuity of care, especially at the end of life. We studied the quality of the 
hospital discharge letter for patients who were hospitalised in their last year 
of life.
METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was performed. Included patients 
had been admitted to the hospital during the period 1 January to 1 July 2017 and 
had died within a year after discharge.
RESULTS: Data were collected from records of 108 patients with cancer or other 
diseases. For 57 patients (53%), the discharge letter included information that 
related to their limited life expectancy (e.g., agreements about treatment 
limitations), whereas the patient's limited life expectancy was addressed in the 
medical record in 76 cases (70%). We found related information in discharge 
letters for 36 patients (66%) who died <3 months compared to 21 patients (40%) 
who died 3-12 months after hospitalisation (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: For patients with a limited life expectancy going home after a 
hospitalisation, one out of two hospital discharge letters lacked any 
information addressing their limited life expectancy. Specific guidelines for 
medical information exchange between care settings are needed.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) guides and constrains the shape of the nervous 
system. In C. elegans, DIG-1 is a giant ECM component that is required for 
fasciculation of sensory dendrites during development and for maintenance of 
axon positions throughout life. We identified four novel alleles of dig-1 in 
three independent screens for mutants affecting disparate aspects of neuronal 
and glial morphogenesis. First, we find that disruption of DIG-1 causes 
fragmentation of the amphid sheath glial cell in larvae and young adults. 
Second, it causes severing of the BAG sensory dendrite from its terminus at the 
nose tip, apparently due to breakage of the dendrite as animals reach adulthood. 
Third, it causes embryonic defects in dendrite fasciculation in inner labial 
(IL2) sensory neurons, as previously reported, as well as rare defects in IL2 
dendrite extension that are enhanced by loss of the apical ECM component DYF-7, 
suggesting that apical and basolateral ECM contribute separately to dendrite 
extension. Our results highlight novel roles for DIG-1 in maintaining the 
cellular integrity of neurons and glia, possibly by creating a barrier between 
structures in the nervous system.

As life expectancy grows, so too will the number of people adversely affected by 
age. Although it is acknowledged that many conditions and diseases are 
associated with age, this mini-review will present a current update of the 
various visual changes that generally occur in healthy individuals disregarding 
the possible effects of illness. These alterations influence how the world is 
perceived and in turn can affect efficiency or the ability to perform ordinary 
daily tasks such as driving or reading. The most common physical developments 
include a decreased pupil size and retinal luminance as well as changes both in 
intercellular and intracellular connections within the retina along the pathway 
to the visual cortex and within the visual cortex. The quantity and the physical 
location of retinal cells including photoreceptors, ganglion and bipolar retinal 
cells are modified. The clarity of intraocular organs, such as the intraocular 
lens, decreases. These all result in common visual manifestations that include 
reduced visual acuity, dry eyes, motility changes, a contraction of the visual 
field, presbyopia, reduced contrast sensitivity, slow dark adaptation, recovery 
from glare, variation in color vision and a decreased visual processing speed. 
Highlighting these prevalent issues as well as current and possible future 
innovations will assist providers to formulate treatments and thereby conserve 
maximum independence and mobility in the modern mature population.

The cost-effectiveness of community health workers delivering free diarrhoea 
treatment: evidence from Uganda.

Wagner Z, Zutshi R, Asiimwe JB, Levine D.

Community health workers (CHWs) are a vital part of the health infrastructure in 
Uganda and in many other low- and middle-income countries. While the need for 
CHWs is clear, it is less clear how they should dispense health products to 
maximize the health benefits to their community. In this study, we assess the 
cost-effectiveness of several competing CHW distribution strategies in the 
context of treatment for child diarrhoea. We used data from a four-armed 
cluster-randomized controlled trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) free 
distribution of oral rehydration salts (ORS) via home deliveries prior to 
diarrhoea onset (free delivery arm), (2) free distribution via vouchers where 
households retrieved the treatment from a central location (voucher arm), (3) a 
door-to-door sales model (home sales arm) and (4) a control arm where CHWs 
carried out their activities as normal. We assessed the cost-effectiveness from 
the implementor's perspective and a societal perspective in terms of cost per 
case treated with ORS and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. 
Free delivery was the most effective strategy and the cheapest from a societal 
perspective. Although implementor costs were highest in this arm, cost savings 
comes from households using fewer resources to seek treatment outside the home 
(transport, doctor fees and treatment costs). From the implementors' 
perspective, free delivery costs $2.19 per additional case treated and $56 per 
DALY averted relative to the control. Free delivery was also extremely 
cost-effective relative to home sales and vouchers, but there was a large degree 
of uncertainty around the comparison with vouchers. Free distribution of ORS by 
CHWs prior to diarrhoea onset is extremely cost-effective compared to other CHW 
distribution models. Implementers of CHW programmes should consider free home 
delivery of ORS.

INTRODUCTION: Budesonide orodispersible tablets (BOT) have been approved in 
Europe and Canada for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a rare 
and chronic disease. The objective of this study was to assess the economic 
impact of BOT on both the induction and maintenance of clinico-pathological 
remission of EoE by performing a cost-utility analysis (CUA).
METHODS: For both the induction and maintenance settings, BOT was compared to no 
treatment in a target population of adult patients with EoE non-responsive to 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. Markov models were developed for the 
induction and maintenance settings over 52-week and life-time horizons, 
respectively. Analyses were performed from both a Canadian Ministry of Health 
(MoH) and societal perspective. The resulting incremental cost-utility ratios 
(ICURs) were compared to a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 
Canadian dollars/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity and scenario 
analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the base-case results.
RESULTS: In the base-case probabilistic analysis, BOT compared to no treatment 
resulted in an ICUR of $1073/QALY and $30,555/QALY from a MoH perspective in the 
induction and maintenance settings, respectively. BOT was a cost-effective 
option for both induction and maintenance in > 99% of Monte Carlo simulations. 
In the scenario analyses, the deterministic ICUR of BOT compared to no treatment 
varied from $682/QALY to $8510/QALY in the induction setting and $21,005/QALY to 
$55,157/QALY in the maintenance setting.
CONCLUSION: BOT was cost-effective compared to no treatment for both the 
induction and maintenance of clinico-pathological remission of EoE in patients 
non-responsive to PPIs.

Over a while, changes in the environment, such as climate, weather, pollution, 
will have a more significant impact on the structures in different ways. Hence, 
continuous monitoring of the structures plays a vital role in order to have a 
predefined prediction of the structural damages that can be caused by the change 
in the environment. Structural health monitoring (SHM) is critical in 
determining the life expectancy of civil structures. The advancement of various 
sensors and data acquisition systems (DAQ) has enabled more accurate prediction 
of the life span of civil structures subjected to static and dynamic loading 
conditions. Hence, SHM is a critical area of research to understand the 
condition and lifetime of structures such as dams. This article provides 
detailed insight into the base failures in dam structures such as soil erosion, 
toe erosion, and gully formation. Also, scouring's impact on the dam structures 
was discussed in this review article. This review article investigates in detail 
the detection and analysis of dam structure damage.

Caplacizumab Model-Based Dosing Recommendations in Pediatric Patients With 
Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a rare and 
life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic microangiopathy. Caplacizumab, evaluated 
in phase II and III studies in adults, shortens the time to platelet count 
response and reduces aTTP exacerbations, has a favorable safety profile, and can 
potentially reduce refractoriness and mortality associated with aTTP. Since no 
children with aTTP were enrolled in these clinical trials, caplacizumab has been 
initially approved for use only in adult patients with aTTP (10 mg). Pediatric 
dosing recommendations were developed using model-based simulations. A 
semimechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic population model has been 
developed describing the interaction between caplacizumab and von Willebrand 
factor antigen (vWF:Ag) following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 
caplacizumab in different adult populations, at various dose levels, using 
nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Based on the allometrically scaled 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model, different dosing regimens were simulated 
in 8000 children (aged 2-18 years). Simulated caplacizumab exposures and vWF:Ag 
levels across different age categories were compared to an adult reference 
group. A simulated daily dose of 5 mg in children weighing <40 kg and of 10 mg 
in children weighing ≥40 kg resulted in similar exposures and vWF:Ag suppression 
across age and weight groups. Despite the lack of pediatric clinical data, the 
results of this modeling and simulation analysis constituted the basis for the 
European extension of indication for caplacizumab (10 mg) to adolescents aged 
>12 years and with a body weight ≥40 kg. This represents a rare case in which 
regulatory authorities have deemed a modeling and simulation study robust enough 
to approve a variation of indication.
