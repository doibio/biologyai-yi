OBJECTIVE: Previous studies imply a profound residual mortality risk following 
successful abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA) repair. This excess mortality is 
generally attributed to increased cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was 
(1) to quantify the excess residual mortality for patients with AAA, (2) to 
evaluate the cross sectional level of cardiovascular risk management, and (3) to 
estimate the potential of optimised cardiovascular risk management to reduce the 
excess mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Excess mortality was estimated through a systematic review and 
meta-analysis, and through data from the Swedish National Health Registry. 
Cardiovascular risk profiles were individually assessed during eligibility 
screening of patients with AAA for two multicentre pharmaceutical AAA 
stabilisation trials. The potential of full implementation of cardiovascular 
risk management was estimated through the validated Second Manifestations of 
ARTerial disease (SMART) risk scores algorithm.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed a similarly impaired survival for patients who 
received early repair (small AAA) or regular repair (≥ 55 mm), and a further 
impaired survival for patients under surveillance for a small AAA. Excess 
mortality was further quantified using Swedish population data. The data 
revealed a more than quadrupled and doubled five year mortality rate for women 
and men who had their AAA repaired, respectively. Evaluation of the level of 
risk management of 358 patients under surveillance in 16 Dutch hospitals showed 
that the majority of patients with AAA did not meet therapeutic targets set for 
risk management in high risk populations, and indicated a more pronounced 
prevention gap in women. Application of the SMART risk score algorithm predicted 
that optimal implementation of risk management guidelines would reduce the 10 
year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events from 43% to 14%.
CONCLUSION: Independent of the rupture risk, AAA is associated with a worryingly 
compromised life expectancy with a particularly poor prognosis for women. 
Optimal implementation of cardiovascular risk prevention guidelines is predicted 
to profoundly reduce cardiovascular risk.

Heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD) are rare pathologies associated with 
thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection, which can be syndromic or 
non-syndromic. They may result from genetic defects. Associated genes identified 
to date are classified into those encoding components of the (a) extracellular 
matrix (b) TGFβ pathway and (c) smooth muscle contractile mechanism. Timely 
diagnosis allows for prompt aortic surveillance and prophylactic surgery, hence 
improving life expectancy and reducing maternal complications as well as 
providing reassurance to family members when a diagnosis is ruled out. This 
document is an expert opinion reflecting strategies put forward by medical 
experts and patient representatives involved in the HTAD Rare Disease Working 
Group of VASCERN. It aims to provide a patient pathway that improves patient 
care by diminishing time to diagnosis, facilitating the establishment of a 
correct diagnosis using molecular genetics when possible, excluding the 
diagnosis in unaffected persons through appropriate family screening and 
avoiding overuse of resources. It is being recommended that patients are 
referred to an expert centre for further evaluation if they meet at least one of 
the following criteria: (1) thoracic aortic dissection (<70 years if 
hypertensive; all ages if non-hypertensive), (2) thoracic aortic aneurysm (all 
adults with Z score >3.5 or 2.5-3.5 if non-hypertensive or hypertensive and <60 
years; all children with Z score >3), (3) family history of HTAD with/without a 
pathogenic variant in a gene linked to HTAD, (4) ectopia lentis without other 
obvious explanation and (5) a systemic score of >5 in adults and >3 in children. 
Aortic imaging primarily relies on transthoracic echocardiography with magnetic 
resonance imaging or computed tomography as needed. Genetic testing should be 
considered in those with a high suspicion of underlying genetic aortopathy. 
Though panels vary among centers, for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm or 
dissection or systemic features these should include genes with a definitive or 
strong association to HTAD. Genetic cascade screening and serial aortic imaging 
should be considered for family screening and follow-up. In conclusion, the 
implementation of these strategies should help standardise the diagnostic 
work-up and follow-up of patients with suspected HTAD and the screening of their 
relatives.

BACKGROUND: Inequalities between different areas in the United Kingdom (UK) 
according to health and employment outcomes are well-documented. Yet it is 
unclear which health indicator is most closely linked to labour market outcomes, 
and whether associations are restricted to the older population.
METHODS: We used the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Longitudinal Study 
(LS) to analyse which measures of health-in-a-place were cross-sectionally 
associated with three employment outcomes in 2011: not being in paid work, 
working hours (part-time, full-time), and economic inactivity (unemployed, 
retired, sick/disabled, other). Seven health indicators from local-authority 
census and vital records data were chosen to represent the older working age 
population (self-rated health 50-74y, long-term illness 50-74y, Age-specific 
mortality rate 50-74y, avoidable mortality, life expectancy at birth and 65 
years, disability-free life expectancy at 50 years, and healthy life expectancy 
at 50 years). An additional two health indicators (life expectancy at birth and 
infant mortality rate) were included as test indicators to determine if 
associations were limited to the health of older people in a place. These nine 
health indicators were then linked with the LS sample aged 16-74y with data on 
employment outcomes and pertinent demographic and individual health information. 
Interactions by gender and age category (16-49y vs. 50-74y) were also tested.
FINDINGS: For all health-in-a-place measures, LS members aged 16-74 who resided 
in the tertile of local authorities with the 'unhealthiest' older population, 
had higher odds of not being in paid work, including all four types of economic 
inactivity. The strongest associations were seen for the health-in-a-place 
measures that were self-reported, long-term illness (Odds Ratio 1.60 [95% 
Confidence Intervals 1.52, 1.67]) and self-rated health (1.60 [1.52, 1.68]). 
Within each measure, associations were slightly stronger for men than women and 
for the 16-49y versus 50-74y LS sample. In models adjusted for individual 
self-rated health and gender and age category interactions, health-in-a-place 
gradients were apparent across all economic inactivity's. However, these same 
gradients were only apparent for women in part-time work and men in full-time 
work.
CONCLUSION: Improving health of older populations may lead to wider economic 
benefits for all.

BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare aggressive primary skin 
carcinoma with an incidence of 44 cases per 100,000. The natural course of MCC 
often results in rapid growth and early metastasis. On the other hand, the 
spinal cord is rarely affected and frequently features the end stage of the 
disease. The aim of this paper was to clarify the management of patients with 
spine metastasis from a skin lesion and showed a case-based update.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old female was admitted to the Neurosurgical 
Department in December 2021 for a sudden right hemiparesis with bladder 
dysfunction and a history of cutaneous Merkel cell carcinoma. A magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) showed an 
intradural-extramedullary right-sided C6-C7 tumor with mass effect and edema of 
the cervical cord. The patient underwent a C6-C7 laminectomy with microsurgical 
total resection of the intradural extramedullary lesion. The neuropathological 
examination identified a metastasis from Merkel cell carcinoma. Nowadays, 
evidence for spinal metastasis from malignities skin cancer is generally 
lacking, probably because they are extremely rare. The exact time of life 
expectancy is controversial, and some clinicians use a cutoff of 3 months to 
determine whether surgical intervention should be offered, while others advocate 
at least 6 months of life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, we showed the first case of solitary 
intradural extramedullary cervical spine metastasis from MCC. We recommend to 
consider metastasis of MCC in the differential diagnosis of spinal metastasis.

Considering human decision-making is essential for understanding the mechanisms 
underlying the propagation of real-life diseases. We present an extension of a 
model for pathogen spread that considers farmers' dynamic decision-making 
regarding the adoption of a control measure in their own herd. Farmers can take 
into account the decisions and observed costs of their trade partners or of 
their geographic neighbours. The model and construction of such costs are 
adapted to the case of bovine viral diarrhoea, for which an individual-based 
stochastic model is considered. Simulation results suggest that obtaining 
information from geographic neighbours might lead to a better control of bovine 
viral diarrhoea than considering information from trade partners. In particular, 
using information from all geographic neighbours at each decision time seems to 
be more beneficial than considering only the information from one geographic 
neighbour or trade partner at each time. This study highlights the central role 
that social dynamics among farmers can take in the spread and control of bovine 
viral diarrhoea, providing insights into how public policy efforts could be 
targeted in order to increase voluntary vaccination uptake against this disease 
in endemic areas.

Cold atmospheric plasma, featured as a non-thermal food processing technology 
has gained prominent attention for its practical application. The demand for 
chilled chicken has increased rapidly due to its nutritious value. However, 
chilled chicken often suffers from a short shelf life due to its susceptibility 
to spoilage. In this study, air- and nitrogen plasma were applied to investigate 
microbial inactivation effects and shelf-life extension of chilled chicken. 
Meanwhile, the microbial diversity of chicken breasts after air and nitrogen-CAP 
treatment and at the end of shelf-life was analyzed. Results illustrated that 
the inactivation effects of air plasma were more potent than that of nitrogen 
plasma, while nitrogen plasma could better maintain the sensory properties. 
Also, further investigation illustrated that air- and nitrogen-CAP could change 
the microbial community significantly. Both treatment time and working gases 
were essential experimental parameters that affected the microbial community 
composition.

PURPOSE: Insomnia negatively affects quality of life in cancer survivors. 
Expectations of insomnia treatment efficacy may influence response to 
intervention. We sought to determine whether pre-treatment outcome expectancy 
predicts response to two non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia among 
cancer survivors.
METHODS: We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial that compared 
acupuncture versus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in cancer 
survivors. Patient expectancy was measured by the Mao Treatment Expectancy Scale 
(MTES) at baseline. Insomnia severity was assessed using the Insomnia Severity 
Index (ISI) at treatment completion (week 8). Multivariate linear regression was 
used to evaluate the associations between pre-treatment expectancy and ISI score 
at week, 8 adjusting for co-variates.
RESULTS: Expectancy for acupuncture and CBT-I were similar at baseline 
(acupuncture: 13.3 ± 4.0; CBT-I: 13.2 ± 2.9, p = 0.17). Greater baseline 
expectancy scores were associated with a greater and statistically significant 
insomnia severity reduction at week 8 in the acupuncture group (beta 
coefficients [Coef.] =  - 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] =  - 0.6 to - 0.1, 
p = 0.016) adjusted for co-variates. Baseline expectancy was not statistically 
associated with insomnia severity reduction in the CBT-I group (Coef. =  - 0.2, 
95% CI =  - 0.7 to 0.2, p = 0.31). High expectancy was significantly associated 
with greater proportion of treatment responders at week 8 in the acupuncture 
group (76% vs. 38%, p = 0.001) but not in the CBT-I group (83% vs. 70%, 
p = 0.21).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher pre-treatment outcome expectancy predicted significantly 
greater insomnia improvement in patients receiving acupuncture but not in those 
receiving CBT-I.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Aligning treatment provision with expected 
outcomes may lead to personalized non-pharmacological insomnia management for 
cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND: This study provides a comprehensive, comparative and updated 
estimates of temporal patterns of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) globally 
over the past three decades.
METHODS: The data on morbidity and mortality of patients with LRIs at the 
global, regional and national levels were retrieved from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2019 study.
RESULTS: Globally, the incident cases of LRIs increased from 414,342,866 [95% 
uncertainty interval (UI):383,529,625 to 449, 086,938]in 1990 to 488,902,504(95% 
UI: 457,572,987 to 522,635,542)in 2019 with the age standardized incidence rate 
(ASIR) decreased from 8,276/100,000 persons (95% UI: 7,727 to 8,892) to 
6,295/100,000 persons (95% UI: 5,887 to 6,737) between 1990 and 2019. Number of 
LRIs deaths were 2,493,200 (95% UI: 2,268,184 to 2,736,184) in 2019, a decrease 
of 24.9% (95% UI: -34.4 to -15.4) in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, the 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR) declined also from 67/100,000 persons (95% 
UI: 61 to 73) in 1990 to 34/100,000 persons (95% UI: 31 to 38) in 2019. 
Moreover, the numbers and age-standardized rates per 100,000 persons of 
morbidity and mortality varied widely by age, sex, Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 
quintiles, and geographical locations in 2019.
CONCLUSION: LRIs remain a major public health concern . Some differences in age, 
sex, SDI quintiles, and geographical locations contribute to LRIs-related global 
health policy development and health system resource optimization.

AIM: To estimate the trend in burden of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at 
global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Annual incident cases, incidence rates, prevalent cases, prevalence 
rates, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and DALY rates of ASD among 
children under 5 years from 1990 to 2019 were collected from the Global Burden 
of Diseases Study 2019. The percentage of relative changes in cases and the 
estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of rates were calculated to reflect 
the temporal trends of ASD burden. Pearson correlation analysis was used to 
explore the influential factors for EAPC.
RESULTS: Globally, the incidence rate, prevalence rate, and DALY rate of ASD 
among children under 5 years were 91.09 per 100,000, 439.39 per 100,000, and 
68.67 per 100,000 in 2019, respectively. From 1990-2019, the incidence rate 
decreased (EAPC = -0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.12 to -0.06), whereas 
the prevalence rate (EAPC=0.08, 95%CI 0.06-0.09) and DALY rate (EAPC=0.08, 95%CI 
0.07-0.10) increased. The largest increases in prevalent cases (80.26%) and 
DALYs (81.24%) were found in low SDI regions, while High-income North America 
experienced the fastest increase in incidence rate, prevalence rate, and DALY 
rate. Moreover, the burden of ASD among male children under 5 years was 
approximately three times that among female children, despite the slight 
narrowing of gender disparity. The EAPC of incidence rate was positively 
correlated with SDI and UHCI in 2019 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: ASD is a noticeable child neurodevelopmental syndrome. More 
attention should be given to early screening, diagnosis, and intervention, 
particularly in resource-limited areas.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the patient care delivery paradigm rapidly shifted 
to remote technological solutions. Rising rates of life expectancy of older 
people, and deaths due to chronic diseases (CDs) such as cancer, diabetes and 
respiratory disease pose many challenges to healthcare. While the feasibility of 
Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) with a Smart Healthcare Monitoring (SHM) 
framework was somewhat questionable before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now a 
proven commodity and is on its way to becoming ubiquitous. More health 
organizations are adopting RPM to enable CD management in the absence of 
individual monitoring. The current studies on SHM have reviewed the applications 
of IoT and/or Machine Learning (ML) in the domain, their architecture, security, 
privacy and other network related issues. However, no study has analyzed the AI 
and ubiquitous computing advances in SHM frameworks. The objective of this 
research is to identify and map key technical concepts in the SHM framework. In 
this context an interesting and meaningful classification of the research 
articles surveyed for this work is presented. The comprehensive and systematic 
review is based on the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analysis" (PRISMA) approach. A total of 2540 papers were screened from 
leading research archives from 2016 to March 2021, and finally, 50 articles were 
selected for review. The major advantages, developments, distinctive 
architectural structure, components, technical challenges and possibilities in 
SHM are briefly discussed. A review of various recent cloud and fog computing 
based architectures, major ML implementation challenges, prospects and future 
trends is also presented. The survey primarily encourages the data driven 
predictive analytics aspects of healthcare and the development of ML models for 
health empowerment.

BACKGROUND: Despite the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system in 
Nepal operating for several decades, it has not been used to produce routine 
mortality statistics. Instead, mortality statistics rely on irregular surveys 
and censuses that primarily focus on child mortality. To fill this knowledge 
gap, this study estimates levels and subnational differentials in mortality 
across all ages in Nepal, primarily using CRVS data adjusted for incompleteness.
METHODS: We analyzed death registration data (offline or paper-based) and CRVS 
survey reported death data, estimating the true crude death rate (CDR) and 
number of deaths by sex and year for each province and ecological belt. The 
estimated true number of deaths for 2017 was used with an extension of the 
empirical completeness method to estimate the adult mortality (45q15) and life 
expectancy at birth by sex and subnational level. Plausibility of subnational 
mortality estimates was assessed against poverty head count rates.
RESULTS: Adult mortality in Nepal for 2017 is estimated to be 159 per 1000 for 
males and 116 for females, while life expectancy was estimated as 69.7 years for 
males and 73.9 years for females. Subnationally, male adult mortality ranges 
from 129 per 1000 in Madhesh to 224 in Karnali and female adult mortality from 
89 per 1000 in Province 1 to 159 in Sudurpashchim. Similarly, male life 
expectancy is between 64.9 years in Karnali and 71.8 years in Madhesh and female 
male life expectancy between 69.6 years in Sudurpashchim and 77.0 years in 
Province 1. Mountain ecological belt and Sudurpashchim and Karnali provinces 
have high mortality and high poverty levels, whereas Terai and Hill ecological 
belts and Province 1, Madhesh, and Bagmati and Gandaki provinces have low 
mortality and poverty levels.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first use of CRVS system data in Nepal to estimate 
national and subnational mortality levels and differentials. The national 
results are plausible when compared with Global Burden of Disease and United 
Nations World Population Prospects estimates. Understanding of the reasons for 
inequalities in mortality in Nepal should focus on improving cause of death data 
and further strengthening CRVS data.

The potato tuberworm, Phthorimaea operculella Zeller, is an oligophagous pest 
feeding on crops mainly belonging to the family Solanaceae. It is one of the 
most destructive pests of potato worldwide and attacks foliage and tubers in the 
field and in storage. However, the lack of a high-quality reference genome has 
hindered the association of phenotypic traits with their genetic basis. Here, we 
report on the genome assembly of P. operculella at the chromosomal level. Using 
Illumina, Nanopore and Hi-C sequencing, a 648.2 Mb genome was generated from 665 
contigs, with an N50 length of 3.2 Mb, and 92.0% (596/648.2 Mb) of the assembly 
was anchored to 29 chromosomes. In total, 16619 genes were annotated, and 92.4% 
of BUSCO genes were fully represented. The chromosome-level genome of P. 
operculella will provide a significant resource for understanding the genetic 
basis for the biological study of this insect, and for promoting the integrative 
management of this pest in future.

The changes in microbiological, physiochemical, and textural properties in fresh 
cheeses made from either cow or goat milk were observed under hyperbaric storage 
(HS, 50-100 MPa) at room temperature (RT) and compared with refrigerated storage 
under normal atmospheric pressure for 60 days. An initial microbial growth 
inhibition was observed for both cheese types, as well as a considerable 
inactivation of all endogenous microbiota under HS/RT (75-100 MPa/RT). This 
contributed to a higher stability of pH and color values, especially at the 
higher pressure at room temperature (100 MPa/RT) throughout 60 days storage. A 
compression effect occurred during HS/RT, resulting in higher whey loss, 
reduction in moisture content, and textural changes. Such changes tended to 
decrease over time, to values closer to the initial ones, with hardness values 
at the 60th day of storage at 75/RT similar to those observed for refrigeration 
on the 7th day and 1.4-fold higher than those observed at 100/RT. Overall, HS/RT 
reduced the microbial populations load during storage (≥5 log units in some 
cases), with minimal effects on most of the evaluated quality parameters. These 
results point to a considerable shelf-life extension of HS fresh cheeses, 
without temperature control, pinpointing HS as a more sustainable preservation 
strategy than refrigeration, with great potential for industrial application. 
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results presented in this study point to increased 
microbial stability of fresh cheeses when stored under hyperbaric storage 
without temperature control, leading possibly to an increased shelf-life, of up 
to 60 days. This kind of new food preservation strategy may be suitable for 
longer transportation of foods, where energy may not be handily and widely 
available, while additionally contributing to increased shelf-life and safety. 
Also, hyperbaric storage could be applied throughout the food storage, improving 
shelf-life with a lower carbon footprint than refrigeration.

PURPOSE: This research examined the cost-effectiveness of adding empagliflozin 
to standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC alone for treatment of heart failure 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) from the perspective of healthcare payers 
in the United Kingdom (UK), Spain and France.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov cohort model was developed to simulate patients' 
progression through health states based on Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score. The model predicted risk of death, 
hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (HHF), treatment-related adverse 
events, and treatment discontinuation each monthly cycle. Clinical inputs and 
utilities were derived from EMPEROR-Reduced trial data, supplemented by 
published literature and national costing databases. Costs (2021 pound 
sterling/euro) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted annually 
for the UK (3.5%), Spain (3.0%) and France (2.5%).
RESULTS: In the UK, Spain and France, empagliflozin plus SoC yielded additional 
QALYs (0.19, 0.23 and 0.21) at higher cost (£1185, €1770 and €1183 per patient) 
than SoC alone, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £6152/QALY, 
€7736/QALY and €5511/QALY, respectively. Reduced HHF incidence provided most 
cost offsets for empagliflozin plus SoC. Similar results were obtained for a 
range of subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity results 
indicated empagliflozin plus SoC remained cost-effective vs. SoC at 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20,000/QALY, €20,000/QALY and €30,000/QALY in 
79.6%, 75.5% and 97.3% of model runs for the UK, Spain and France, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin added to SoC leads to health benefits for patients 
with HFrEF and is a cost-effective treatment option for payers in multiple 
European countries (UK, Spain, France).

Neurotrauma, especially repetitive neurotrauma, is associated with the 
development of progressive neurodegeneration leading to chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy (CTE). Exposure to neurotrauma regularly occurs during sports and 
military service, often not requiring medical care. However, exposure to severe 
and/or repeated sub-clinical neurotrauma has been shown cause physical and 
psychological disability, leading to reduce life expectancy. Misfolding of 
proteins, or proteinopathy, is a pathological hallmark of CTE, in which chronic 
injury leads to local and diffuse protein aggregates. These aggregates are an 
overlapping feature of many neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE, Alzheimer's 
Disease, Parkinsons disease. Neurotrauma is also a significant risk factor for 
the development of these diseases, however the mechanism's underlying this 
association are not well understood. While phosphorylated tau aggregates are the 
primary feature of CTE, amyloid-beta, Transactive response DNA-binding protein 
43 (TDP-43), and alpha-synuclein (αSyn) are also well documented. Aberrant 
misfolding of these proteins has been shown to disrupt brain homeostasis leading 
to neurodegeneration in a disease dependent manor. In CTE, the interaction 
between proteinopathies and their associated neurodegeneration is a current area 
of study. Here we provide an update on current literature surrounding the 
prevalence, characteristics, and pathogenesis of proteinopathies in CTE.

The combined effect of ε-polylysine (PL) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP; 
60% CO2/40% N2) on the bacterial community of greater amberjack filets and their 
physicochemical properties was evaluated at 4°C. The total viable counts (TVC), 
psychrotrophic bacterial count, sensory index, texture analysis, and total 
volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) revealed that PL, MAP, and MAP + PL treatment 
delayed the deterioration of greater amberjack filets. These treatment groups 
also showed decreased accumulation of biogenic amines. High-throughput 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing results indicated that these treatments suppressed the growth of 
Pseudomonas in greater amberjack filets. Furthermore, the MAP + PL treatment 
group was observed to be more effective than the PL and MAP groups, extending 
the shelf life of greater amberjack filets by 6 days. This investigation showed 
that the combination of PL and MAP has the potential to retain the quality and 
extend the shelf life of greater amberjack.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Studies assessing the health benefits of air 
pollution reduction in Vietnam are scarce. This study quantified the annual 
mortality burden due to PM2.5 pollution in Vietnam above the World Health 
Organization recommendation for community health (AQG: 5 μg/m3) and the proposed 
National Technical Regulation on Ambient Air Quality (proposed QCVN: 15 μg/m3).
METHODOLOGY: This study applied a health impact assessment methodology with the 
hazard risk function for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and lower respiratory 
infections (LRIs) in the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to calculate 
attributable deaths, Years of Life lost, and Loss of Life expectancy at birth 
due to air pollution in the Vietnamese population above 25 years of age in 11 
provinces. We obtained annual average PM2.5 concentrations for Vietnam in 2019 
at a 3x3 km grid modeled using Mixed Linear regression and multi-data sources. 
Population and baseline mortality data were obtained from administrative data 
system in Vietnam. We reported the findings at both the provincial and smaller 
district levels.
RESULTS: Annual PM2.5 concentrations in all studied provinces exceeded both the 
AQG and the proposed QCVN. The maximum annual number of attributable deaths in 
the studied provinces if they had complied with WHO air quality guidelines was 
in Ha Noi City, with 5,090 (95%CI: 4,253-5,888) attributable deaths. At the 
district level, the highest annual rate of attributable deaths if the WHO 
recommendation for community health had been met was 104.6 (95%CI: 87.0-121.5) 
attributable deaths per 100,000 population in Ly Nhan (Ha Nam province).
CONCLUSION: A much larger number of premature deaths in Vietnam could 
potentially be avoided by lowering the recommended air quality standard. These 
results highlight the need for effective clean air action plans by local 
authorities to reduce air pollution and improve community health.

Deepak SundriyalBackground and Objectives  The newly established medical 
oncology and hemato-oncology center at the All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India, provided us an opportunity to 
audit in-hospital mortalities with a vision that the audit will serve as a 
standard for ceaseless improvement. Aim of the study was to initiate a vigorous 
process for the evaluation of all-cause mortality in patients suffering from 
cancer. Methods  An audit of all in-hospital deaths that occurred during the 
year 2019 was performed, and comprehensive scrutiny of various parameters 
(demographic, clinico-pathological, therapeutic, causes of death) was done. 
Reviews from two independent observers sharpened the infallibility of the audit. 
The lacunae in the existing practices and the scope for further improvement were 
noted. Results  Forty-five in-hospital deaths were registered during the study 
period (January-December 2019). The majority of the deaths occurred in patients 
with advanced stage of malignancy ([ n = 31] 68.8%). Most common causes of death 
were progressive disease, neutropenic, and non-neutropenic sepsis. 
Chemotherapeutic agents, growth factors, blood components, and antibiotics were 
found to be used judiciously as per institutional policy. The reviewers 
emphasized on the use of comorbidity indexes in the treatment planning and 
avoiding intensive care unit referrals for patients receiving best supportive 
care (BSC). Emphasis was put on providing only BSC to the patients with a very 
limited life expectancy. Emphasis was also laid down on record of out of the 
hospital deaths. Interpretation and Conclusion  The audit disclosed areas of 
care which require further improvement. The mortality audit exercise should 
become a regular part of evaluation and training for the ongoing and future 
quality commitment. This should impact the clinical decision making in an 
oncology center providing quality care to the terminally ill patients.
