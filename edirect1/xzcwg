centres as well as community groups, completed semi-structured interviews which 
were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis using grounded theory.
RESULTS: The model of sexual adjustment to HIV is the first to establish how 
undue fears of transmission of HIV during sex and/or fear of rejection by sexual 
partners determine initial sexual behaviour after diagnosis and also sexual 
adjustment over time. Within the model, sexual adjustment to HIV is facilitated 
by factors which assist PLWH to overcome such fears, including: partner 
acceptance, peer, community and health professional support, and accurate 
knowledge of risk of transmission including of undetectable viral load and 
pre-exposure prophylaxis. Adjustment is inhibited when undue fears of 
transmission and of rejection persist long term, resulting in maladaptive 
behaviours to cope with such fears including avoidance of sex and problematic 
drug and alcohol use.
CONCLUSION: This model offers clear directions for promoting sexual adjustment 
to HIV. Health professionals should: (a) assess and intervene for sexual quality 
of life (not just risk) among PLWH; (b) be aware that serosorting facilitates 
adjustment in the short to medium term, but may interfere with adjustment 
long-term, (c) promote opportunities for positive connection between PLWH, and 
(d) intervene directly with PLWH and HIV negative sexual partners to promote 
accurate risk of transmission knowledge, including how this applies to their own 
sexual practices, and whether they are experiencing undue fear of transmission 
over time.

BACKGROUND: The present study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of an 
influenza vaccination program for children in the Netherlands. This requires an 
evaluation of the long-term impact of such a program on the burden of influenza 
across all age groups, using a transmission model that accounts for the seasonal 
variability in vaccine effectiveness and the shorter duration of protection 
following vaccination as compared to natural infection.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a stochastic 
dynamic transmission model that has been calibrated to reported GP visits with 
influenza-like illness in the Netherlands over 11 seasons (2003/2004 to 
2014/2015). We analyzed the costs and effects of extending the current program 
with vaccination of children aged 2-16 years at 50% coverage over 20 consecutive 
seasons. We measured the effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and we 
adopted a societal perspective.
RESULTS: The childhood vaccination program is estimated to have an average 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3944 per QALY gained and is 
cost-effective in the general population (across 1000 simulations; conventional 
Dutch threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained). The childhood vaccination program 
is not estimated to be cost-effective for the target-group itself with an 
average ICER of €57,054 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analyses reveal that these 
ICERs hide a wide range of outcomes. Even though introduction of a childhood 
vaccination program decreases the number of infections, it tends to lead to 
larger epidemics: in 23.3% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination 
program results in an increase in seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger 
than 5%, which is expected to cause serious strain on the health care system. In 
6.4% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program leads to a net loss 
of QALYs. These findings are robust across different targeted age groups and 
vaccination coverages.
CONCLUSIONS: Modeling indicates that childhood influenza vaccination is 
cost-effective in the Netherlands. However, childhood influenza vaccination is 
not cost-effective when only outcomes for the children themselves are 
considered. In approximately a quarter of the simulations, the introduction of a 
childhood vaccination program increases the frequency of seasons with a 
symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%. The possibility of an overall health 
loss cannot be excluded.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is a rare cancer, accounting for only 1% of all 
malignancies in England and Wales. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) accounts 
for ≈94% of all thyroid cancers. Patients with DTC often require treatment with 
radioactive iodine. Treatment for DTC that is refractory to radioactive iodine 
[radioactive iodine-refractory DTC (RR-DTC)] is often limited to best supportive 
care (BSC).
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness 
of lenvatinib (Lenvima®; Eisai Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK) and sorafenib (Nexar®; 
Bayer HealthCare, Leverkusen, Germany) for the treatment of patients with 
RR-DTC.
DATA SOURCES: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, The Cochrane Library and EconLit were 
searched (date range 1999 to 10 January 2017; searched on 10 January 2017). The 
bibliographies of retrieved citations were also examined.
REVIEW METHODS: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic 
reviews, prospective observational studies and economic evaluations of 
lenvatinib or sorafenib. In the absence of relevant economic evaluations, we 
constructed a de novo economic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
lenvatinib and sorafenib with that of BSC.
RESULTS: Two RCTs were identified: SELECT (Study of [E7080] LEnvatinib in 
131I-refractory differentiated Cancer of the Thyroid) and DECISION (StuDy of 
sorafEnib in loCally advanced or metastatIc patientS with radioactive 
Iodine-refractory thyrOid caNcer). Lenvatinib and sorafenib were both reported 
to improve median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo: 18.3 
months (lenvatinib) vs. 3.6 months (placebo) and 10.8 months (sorafenib) vs. 5.8 
months (placebo). Patient crossover was high (≥ 75%) in both trials, confounding 
estimates of overall survival (OS). Using OS data adjusted for crossover, trial 
authors reported a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients 
treated with lenvatinib compared with those given placebo (SELECT) but not for 
patients treated with sorafenib compared with those given placebo (DECISION). 
Both lenvatinib and sorafenib increased the incidence of adverse events (AEs), 
and dose reductions were required (for > 60% of patients). The results from nine 
prospective observational studies and 13 systematic reviews of lenvatinib or 
sorafenib were broadly comparable to those from the RCTs. Health-related 
quality-of-life (HRQoL) data were collected only in DECISION. We considered the 
feasibility of comparing lenvatinib with sorafenib via an indirect comparison 
but concluded that this would not be appropriate because of differences in trial 
and participant characteristics, risk profiles of the participants in the 
placebo arms and because the proportional hazard assumption was violated for 
five of the six survival outcomes available from the trials. In the base-case 
economic analysis, using list prices only, the cost-effectiveness comparison of 
lenvatinib versus BSC yields an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of £65,872, and the comparison of 
sorafenib versus BSC yields an ICER of £85,644 per QALY gained. The 
deterministic sensitivity analyses show that none of the variations lowered the 
base-case ICERs to < £50,000 per QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: We consider that it is not possible to compare the clinical 
effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib and sorafenib.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo/BSC, treatment with lenvatinib or sorafenib 
results in an improvement in PFS, objective tumour response rate and possibly 
OS, but dose modifications were required to treat AEs. Both treatments exhibit 
estimated ICERs of > £50,000 per QALY gained. Further research should include 
examination of the effects of lenvatinib, sorafenib and BSC (including HRQoL) 
for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and the positioning of 
treatments in the treatment pathway.

Plain Language Summary: WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM? Differentiated thyroid cancer is a 
common type of thyroid cancer. For many patients, radioactive iodine is an 
effective treatment; however, for some patients, the treatment stops working or 
becomes unsafe. Two new drugs, lenvatinib (Lenvima®; Eisai Ltd, Hertfordshire, 
UK) and sorafenib (Nexar®; Bayer HealthCare, Leverkusen, Germany), may be new 
treatment options.
WHAT DID WE DO? We reviewed the clinical evidence of lenvatinib and sorafenib. 
We also estimated the costs and benefits of treatment.
WHAT DID WE FIND? Compared with no treatment, treatment with lenvatinib or 
sorafenib may increase the time that people live with thyroid cancer before 
their disease gets worse; however, both drugs are expensive and may have 
unpleasant side effects.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? At their published (undiscounted) prices, lenvatinib or 
sorafenib may not be considered to provide good value for money to the NHS.

The brain age index (BAI) measures the difference between an individual's 
apparent "brain age" (BA; estimated by comparing EEG features during sleep from 
an individual with age norms), and their chronological age (CA); that is BAI = 
BA-CA. Here, we evaluate whether BAI predicts life expectancy. Brain age was 
quantified using a previously published machine learning algorithm for a cohort 
of participants ≥40 years old who underwent an overnight sleep 
electroencephalogram (EEG) as part of the Sleep Heart Health Study (n = 4877). 
Excess brain age (BAI >0) was associated with reduced life expectancy (adjusted 
hazard ratio: 1.12, [1.03, 1.21], p = 0.002). Life expectancy decreased by -0.81 
[-1.44, -0.24] years per standard-deviation increase in BAI. Our findings show 
that BAI, a sleep EEG-based biomarker of the deviation of sleep microstructure 
from patterns normal for age, is an independent predictor of life expectancy.

PURPOSE: In China, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are the only approved non-vitamin 
K antagonist oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). 
The goal of this article was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran 
versus rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in Chinese 
patients with AF from the perspective of the Chinese health care system.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
dabigatran versus rivaroxaban. Clinical events were modeled for a lifetime 
horizon, based on clinical efficacy data from indirect treatment comparisons. 
The weighted average of the most recent prices of these 2 drugs was used as the 
drug acquisition cost. Other costs, including follow-up costs and event costs, 
were collected by using a survey from a panel of local experts. Utility inputs 
(health state utilities, clinical event disutilities, and event history utility) 
were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity analyses that included 
scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to 
examine the robustness of the economic model.
FINDINGS: Over a lifetime, patients treated with dabigatran experienced fewer 
ischemic strokes (2.14 dabigatran vs 2.61 rivaroxaban) and fewer intracranial 
hemorrhage (0.48 vs 0.94) per 100 patient-years. In the base case analysis, 
dabigatran had an incremental cost of ¥28,128 but with higher life years (10.38 
vs 10.14) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (7.95 vs 7.70). The resulting 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥112,910 per QALY gained and net 
monetary benefit of ¥12,214 versus rivaroxaban showed that dabigatran was a 
cost-effective alternative to rivaroxaban. Extensive sensitivity analyses 
indicated that the results were robust over a wide range of inputs. The 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that dabigatran was cost-effective 
in 84.2% of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations compared with rivaroxaban.
IMPLICATIONS: Dabigatran reduced the occurrence of clinical events and increased 
QALYs compared with rivaroxaban. The use of dabigatran for the prevention of 
stroke and systemic embolism is a cost-effective option compared with 
rivaroxaban among patients with AF in China.

BACKGROUND: With the improvements in cancer diagnosis and treatment, more 
patients with cancer are surviving for longer periods than before. This study 
aims to quantify the proportion cured and median survival time for those who are 
not cured for major cancers in Australia.
METHODS: Australian population-based cohort of 2,164,172 cases, ages 15 to 89 
years, whose first cancer diagnosis between 1982 and 2014 was one of 22 leading 
cancers, were followed up to December 2014. Flexible parametric cure models were 
used to estimate the proportion cured and median survival time for those uncured 
by age, sex, and spread of disease, and temporal trends in these measures.
RESULTS: Cure estimates could be generated for 19 of the 22 cancer types. The 
unadjusted proportion cured ranged from 5.0% for pancreatic cancer to 90.0% for 
melanoma. Median survival time for those uncured ranged from 0.35 years for 
pancreatic cancer to 6.05 years for prostate cancer. Cancers were divided into 
four groups according to their proportion cured in the 1980s and the degree of 
improvement over 28 years. Esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder, 
lung, and brain cancer had lower proportion cured and smaller improvements over 
time.
CONCLUSIONS: For cancers with poor survival in which little has changed over 
time either in prolonging life or achieving statistical cure, efforts should be 
focused on reducing the prevalence of known risk factors and earlier detection, 
thereby enabling more effective treatment.
IMPACT: Cure models provide unique insights into whether survival improvements 
are due to prolonging life or through curing the disease.

PURPOSE: Life expectancy for people with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is 
increasing due to advances in treatment methods and in neuro-urology. Thus, 
developing urinary bladder cancer (UBC) is gaining importance.
METHODS: Single-centre retrospective evaluation of consecutive in- and 
out-patient data with spinal cord injury between January 1st, 1998 and December 
31st, 2018 was carried out and data were compared with UBC data of the German 
population from the German Centre for Cancer Registry Data at Robert Koch 
Institute.
RESULTS: A total of 37 (4 female, 33 male) out of 7004 patients with SCI were 
diagnosed with histologically proven UBC (median follow-up 85 months). Median 
age at UBC diagnosis was 54.0 years (general population: 74 years). The SCI 
patients had significantly (p < 0.0001, each) more frequent muscle-invasive 
tumors (81% ≥ T2) and unfavorable grading (76% G3), compared to the general 
population. Median survival was 13 months for transitional cell carcinoma 
(n = 31) and 4 months for squamous cell carcinoma (n = 5) (p = 0.0039), resp. 
The median survival of the 24 cystectomized patients was 15.0 months. Long-term 
suprapubic or indwelling catheterization was found in only eight patients for a 
total of only 5.09% (median 15.5 months) of the latency of all patients. No 
significant differences for T category and grading were observed between the 
bladder emptying methods intermittent catheterisation and catheter-free voiding.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in patients with SCI bladder management 
even without permanent catheterization represents a considerable risk for the 
development of UBC.

BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA, bile duct cancer) is a rare malignant 
disease with a poor prognosis. For several years interdisciplinary tumor boards 
(TuB) with the participation of experts from various disciplines have been 
organized to optimize medical treatment for patients suffering from oncological 
diseases.
OBJECTIVE: This study addressed the question whether the introduction of TuB 
leads to a better life expectancy and quality of life for patients with CCA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study 161 patients treated for CCA 
were investigated. The patient collective was divided in two groups (TuB+ vs. 
TuB-) and a propensity score matching was carried out.
RESULTS: The patient group TuB+ included 109 patients (67.7%) and the control 
group (TuB-) included 52 patients (32.3%). Using propensity score matching 
84 patients in the TuB+ and 50 in the TuB group were identified and matched. The 
survival rates of the matched patients demonstrated an advantage for patients in 
the TuB+ group (1-year survival rate 61.9%, 5‑year survival rate 23.6%, 10-year 
survival rate 18.0%) over patients in the TuB-group (1-year survival rate 32.0%, 
5‑year survival rate 8.0%, 10-year survival rate 0%) with p < 0.001. The results 
of the univariate (hazard ratio, HR 0.513, 95% confidence interval, CI 
0.350-0.751, p = 0.001) and the multivariate Cox proportional hazard models (HR 
0.459, 95% CI 0.303-0.694, p < 0.001) showed a significant benefit in survival 
for patients in the TuB+ group.
CONCLUSION: This article shows that the introduction of a TuB meeting can 
provide a measurable benefit for patients with CCA. Hence it is recommended that 
all cases of patients with CCA should be discussed in a TuB.

The success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to both extended life 
expectancy and improved quality of life among people living with HIV (PLWH). To 
maximize the efficacy of first line ART regimens in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMIC), we need culturally-relevant interventions that empower 
participants to reduce barriers to long-term uninterrupted adherence. The 
Chetana adherence intervention trial was designed in collaboration with local 
community groups as a comprehensive wellness program for adherence-challenged 
PLWH and included peer-led adherence support, yoga, nutrition, information about 
local resources, and individual counseling using motivational interviewing 
techniques. Intervention arm participants were almost twice as likely to be 
virally suppressed at their 12-month follow-up visit (AOR = 1.98; 95% CI [1.2, 
3.23]) as were participants in the active control arm. They were also about 
twice as likely as control arm participants to self-report ≥ 95% adherence 
(AOR = 1.86, 95% CI [1.09, 3.15]), and as having eliminated individual adherence 
barriers (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI [1.51, 3.62]) and clinic attendance barriers 
(AOR = 2.01, 95% CI [1.20, 3.38]) These low-cost strategies can be implemented 
by local NGOs, making it both scalable and sustainable in this and similar 
settings.

INTRODUCTION: Elderly patients constitute an expanding part of our society. Due 
to a continuously increasing life expectancy, an optimal quality of life is 
expected even into advanced age. Glioblastoma (GBM) is more common in older 
patients, but they are still often withheld from efficient treatment due to 
worry of worse tolerance and have a significantly worse prognosis compared to 
younger patients. Our retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the 
therapeutic benefit from a second resection in recurrent glioblastoma of elderly 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included a cohort of 39 elderly patients (> 65 years) 
with a second resection as treatment option in the case of a tumor recurrence. A 
causal inference model was built by multiple non- and semiparametric models, 
which was used to identify matched patients from our elderly GBM database which 
comprises 538 patients. The matched cohorts were analyzed by a Cox-regression 
model adjusted by time-dependent covariates.
RESULTS: The Cox-regression analysis showed a significant survival benefit 
(Hazard Ratio: 0.6, 95% CI 0.36-0.9, p-value = 0.0427) for the re-resected group 
(18.0 months, 95% CI 13.97-23.2 months) compared to the group without 
re-resection (10.1 months, 95% CI 8.09-20.9 months). No differences in the 
co-morbidities or hemato-oncological side effects during chemotherapy could be 
detected. Anesthetic- and surgical complications were rare and comparable to the 
complication rate of patients undergoing the first-line resection.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, in elderly patients, re-resection is an acceptable 
treatment option in the recurrent state of a glioblastoma. The individual 
evaluation of the patients' medical status as well as the chances of 
withstanding general anesthesia needs to be done in close interdisciplinary 
consultation. If these requirements are met, elderly patients benefit from a 
re-resection.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent 
diseases in the World, and one of the most important causes of mortality and 
morbidity. In adults 40 years and older, it affects more than 10% of the 
population and has enormous personal, family and social burden. Tobacco smoking 
is its main cause, but not the only one, and there is probably a genetic 
predisposition that increases the risk in some patients. The paradigm of this 
disease is changing in Spain, with an increase of women that has occurred in 
recent years. Many of the physio pathological mechanisms of this condition are 
well known, but the psychological alterations to which it leads, the impact of 
COPD on relatives and caregivers, the limitation of daily life observed in these 
patients, and the economic and societal burden that they represent for the 
health system, are not so well-known. A major problem is the high 
under-diagnosis, mainly due to difficulties for obtaining, in a systematic way, 
spirometries in hospitals and health-care centers. For this reason, the 
Fundación de Ciencias de la Salud and the Spanish National Network Center for 
Research in Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES) have brought together experts in 
COPD, patients and their organizations, clinical psychologists, experts in 
health economics, nurses and journalists to obtain their opinion about COPD in 
Spain. They also discussed the scientific bibliometrics on COPD that is being 
carried out from the CIBERES and speculated on the future of this condition. The 
format of the meeting consisted in the discussion of a series of questions that 
were addressed by different speakers and discussed until a consensus conclusion 
was reached.

La enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica (EPOC) es una de las enfermedades más 
prevalentes en el mundo y una de las causas más importantes de mortalidad y 
morbilidad. En los adultos de más de 40 años, afecta al menos al 10% de la 
población y tiene una enorme carga personal, familiar y social. El tabaquismo es 
su principal causa, pero no la única, y probablemente existe una predisposición 
genética que aumenta el riesgo en algunos pacientes. El paradigma de esta 
enfermedad está cambiando en España, con un aumento de la incidencia en mujeres 
que se ha producido en los últimos años. Muchos de los mecanismos 
fisiopatológicos de la EPOC son bien conocidos, pero no lo son tanto las 
alteraciones psicológicas a las que conduce, el impacto de la enfermedad en los 
familiares y cuidadores, la limitación de la vida cotidiana que se observa en 
estos pacientes y la carga económica y social que representan para el sistema 
sanitario. Un problema importante es el elevado infra-diagnóstico, debido 
principalmente a las dificultades para obtener, de forma sistemática, 
espirometrías en los hospitales y centros de salud. Por este motivo, la 
Fundación de Ciencias de la Salud y el Centro de Investigación en Enfermedades 
Respiratorias (CIBERES) han reunido a expertos en EPOC, pacientes y sus 
organizaciones, psicólogos clínicos, expertos en economía de la salud, 
enfermeras y periodistas para obtener su opinión sobre la EPOC en España. 
También se ha hablado de la bibliometría científica sobre la EPOC que se está 
llevando a cabo desde el CIBERES y se ha especulado sobre el futuro de esta 
enfermedad. El formato de la reunión consistió en la discusión de una serie de 
cuestiones que fueron abordadas por diferentes ponentes y discutidas hasta 
llegar a una conclusión consensuada.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac 
arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of stroke and congestive 
heart failure. Lead-I electrocardiogram (ECG) devices are handheld instruments 
that can be used to detect AF at a single time point in people who present with 
relevant signs or symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic test accuracy, clinical impact and 
cost-effectiveness of using single time point lead-I ECG devices for the 
detection of AF in people presenting to primary care with relevant signs or 
symptoms, and who have an irregular pulse compared with using manual pulse 
palpation (MPP) followed by a 12-lead ECG in primary or secondary care.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print and MEDLINE In-Process & 
Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Databases of Systematic 
Reviews, Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts 
of Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment Database.
METHODS: The systematic review methods followed published guidance. Two 
reviewers screened the search results (database inception to April 2018), 
extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies. Summary 
estimates of diagnostic accuracy were calculated using bivariate models. An 
economic model consisting of a decision tree and two cohort Markov models was 
developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of lead-I ECG devices.
RESULTS: No studies were identified that evaluated the use of lead-I ECG devices 
for patients with signs or symptoms of AF. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy 
and clinical impact results presented are derived from an asymptomatic 
population (used as a proxy for people with signs or symptoms of AF). The 
summary sensitivity of lead-I ECG devices was 93.9% [95% confidence interval 
(CI) 86.2% to 97.4%] and summary specificity was 96.5% (95% CI 90.4% to 98.8%). 
One study reported limited clinical outcome data. Acceptability of lead-I ECG 
devices was reported in four studies, with generally positive views. The de novo 
economic model yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The results of the pairwise analysis 
show that all lead-I ECG devices generated ICERs per QALY gained below the 
£20,000-30,000 threshold. Kardia Mobile (AliveCor Ltd, Mountain View, CA, USA) 
is the most cost-effective option in a full incremental analysis.
LIMITATIONS: No published data evaluating the diagnostic accuracy, clinical 
impact or cost-effectiveness of lead-I ECG devices for the population of 
interest are available.
CONCLUSIONS: Single time point lead-I ECG devices for the detection of AF in 
people with signs or symptoms of AF and an irregular pulse appear to be a 
cost-effective use of NHS resources compared with MPP followed by a 12-lead ECG 
in primary or secondary care, given the assumptions used in the base-case model.
FUTURE WORK: Studies assessing how the use of lead-I ECG devices in this 
population affects the number of people diagnosed with AF when compared with 
current practice would be useful.

Plain Language Summary: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of 
abnormal heart rhythm. People with AF are more likely to have a serious stroke 
or die than people without the condition. Many people go to their general 
practitioner (GP) with the signs or symptoms commonly linked to AF, such as 
feeling dizzy, being short of breath, feeling tired and having heart 
palpitations. GPs check for AF by taking the patient’s pulse by hand. If the GP 
thinks that the patient might have AF, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) test is 
arranged. Lead-I (i.e. one lead) ECGs are handheld electronic devices that could 
detect AF more accurately than a manual pulse check. If GPs were to routinely 
use lead-I ECG devices, people with suspected AF could receive treatment while 
waiting for the AF diagnosis to be confirmed by a 12-lead ECG. This study aimed 
to assess whether or not the use of lead-I ECGs in GP surgeries could benefit 
these patients and offer good value for money to the NHS. All studies that 
examined how well lead-I ECGs identified people with AF were reviewed, and the 
economic value of using these devices was assessed. No evidence was found that 
examined the use of lead-I ECGs for people with signs or symptoms of AF. As an 
alternative, evidence for the use of lead-I ECGs for people with no symptoms of 
AF was searched for and these data were used to assess value for money. The 
study found that using a manual pulse check followed by a lead-I ECG offers 
value for money when compared with a manual pulse check followed by a 12-lead 
ECG. This is mostly because patients with AF can begin treatment earlier when a 
GP has access to a lead-I ECG device.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the commonest causes of sight 
loss in the elderly population and to date there is no intervention that slows 
or prevents early AMD disease progressing to blinding neovascularization or 
geographic atrophy. AMD is a complex disease and factors proposed to contribute 
to the development and progression of disease include aging, genetics, 
epigenetics, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory state, and life-style factors 
such as smoking, alcohol, and high fat diet. Here, we generate a knowledge 
repository of pathways and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks likely to 
be implicated in AMD pathogenesis, such as complement activation, lipid 
trafficking and metabolism, vitamin A cycle, oxidative stress, proteostasis, 
bioenergetics, autophagy/mitophagy, extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, and 
choroidal vascular dropout. Two disctinct clusters ermerged from the networks 
for parainflamation and ECM homeostasis, which may represent two different 
disease modules underlying AMD pathology. Our analyses also suggest that the 
disease manifests primarily in RPE/choroid and less in neural retina. The use of 
standardized syntax when generating maps of these biological processes (SBGN 
standard) and networks (PSI standard) enables visualization of complex 
information in graphical programs such as CellDesigner and Cytoscape and 
enhances reusability and extension of data. The ability to focus onto 
subnetworks, multiple visualizations and simulation options will enable the AMD 
research community to computationally model subnetworks or to test 
experimentally new hypotheses arising from connectivities in the AMD pathway 
map.

Development of motion capture technology has enabled the measurement of body 
movements over long periods of time in daily life. Although accelerometers have 
been used as primary sensors, problems arise when they are used to measure the 
movements of infants. Because infants and caregivers interact frequently, 
accelerometer data from infants may be significantly distorted by a caregiver's 
movement. To overcome this problem, a strain sensor suit was developed for 
infants to measure flexion and extension movements of the limbs. A case study 
was performed to analyze the strain sensor data of an infant in relation to the 
accelerometer data of the infant's and a caregiver's body under various types of 
infant-caregiver interaction. The results demonstrated that the strain sensor 
data had low correlation with the accelerometer data of the infant and caregiver 
while the accelerometer data between infant and caregiver had higher 
correlation. This suggests that the strain sensor is suitable to detect limbs' 
angular displacements mostly independent from the translational body movements 
exerted by a caregiver.

Postharvest diseases of potato lead to significant food and economic losses 
worldwide. The exogenous application of eco-friendly methods plays an important 
role in the control of postharvest decay. In this work the effects of endophytic 
bacteria B. subtilis (10-4, 26D) were studied in the context of two application 
parameters: concentration, with a range between 103-108 CFU/mL tested, and 
synergistic effects of the signal molecule salicylic acid (SA) (0.05 mM) on 
potato tubers' resistance to Phytophthora infestans and Fusarium oxysporum 
during storage. The experiments were carried out on hydroponically grown potato 
(Solanum tuberosum L.) mini-tubers. This study demonstrates the suppressive 
effect of B. subtilis (10-4, 26D) on diseases of potato during storage and 
reveals that this effect happens in a dose-dependent manner, both individually 
and in combination with SA. The most effective concentrations of B. subtilis for 
suppression of both Ph. infestans and F. oxysporum are 108 CFU/mL (10-4 and 
26D), 107 CFU/mL (10-4 + SA) and 106 CFU/mL (26D + SA). The ability of B. 
subtilis (10-4, 26D) to effectively penetrate and colonize the internal tubers' 
tissues when applied immediately prior to storage, and the ability of SA to 
accelerate these processes, have been proven. B. subtilis (10-4, 26D), 
individually and in compositions with SA, increased ascorbic acid content and 
decreased pathogen-induced proline accumulation and lipid peroxidation in 
tubers. This indicates a protective effect conferred to cells against reactive 
oxygen and an extension of aging processes, manifested by a prolonged shelf life 
and extended preservation of fresh appearance.

Expansins are key regulators of cell-wall extension and are also involved in the 
abiotic stress response. In this study, we evaluated the function of OsEXPA7 
involved in salt stress tolerance. Phenotypic analysis showed that OsEXPA7 
overexpression remarkably enhanced tolerance to salt stress. OsEXPA7 was highly 
expressed in the shoot apical meristem, root, and the leaf sheath. Promoter 
activity of OsEXPA7:GUS was mainly observed in vascular tissues of roots and 
leaves. Morphological analysis revealed structural alterations in the root and 
leaf vasculature of OsEXPA7 overexpressing (OX) lines. OsEXPA7 overexpression 
resulted in decreased sodium ion (Na+) and accumulated potassium ion (K+) in the 
leaves and roots. Under salt stress, higher antioxidant activity was also 
observed in the OsEXPA7-OX lines, as indicated by lower reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) accumulation and increased antioxidant activity, when compared with the 
wild-type (WT) plants. In addition, transcriptional analysis using RNA-seq and 
RT-PCR revealed that genes involved in cation exchange, auxin signaling, 
cell-wall modification, and transcription were differentially expressed between 
the OX and WT lines. Notably, salt overly sensitive 1, which is a sodium 
transporter, was highly upregulated in the OX lines. These results suggest that 
OsEXPA7 plays an important role in increasing salt stress tolerance by 
coordinating sodium transport, ROS scavenging, and cell-wall loosening.

BACKGROUND: The long-term benefit of revascularization for intermittent 
claudication is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared with a noninvasive 
approach.
METHODS: The IRONIC trial (Invasive Revascularization or Not in Intermittent 
Claudication) randomized patients with mild-to-severe intermittent claudication 
to either revascularization + best medical therapy + structured exercise therapy 
(the revascularization group) or best medical therapy + structured exercise 
therapy (the nonrevascularization group). The health-related quality of life 
short form 36 questionnaire was primary outcome and disease-specific 
health-related quality of life (vascular quality of life questionnaire) and 
treadmill walking distances were secondary end points. Health-related quality of 
life has previously been reported superior in the revascularization group at 1- 
and 2-year follow-up. In this study, the 5-year results were determined. The 
cost-effectiveness of the treatment options was analyzed from a payer/healthcare 
standpoint.
RESULTS: Altogether, 158 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Regarding the 
primary end point, no intergroup differences were observed for the short form 36 
sum or domain scores from baseline to 5 years, except for the short form 36 role 
emotional domain score, with greater improvement in the nonrevascularization 
group (n=116, P=0.007). No intergroup differences were observed in the vascular 
quality of life questionnaire total and domain scores (n=116, NS) or in 
treadmill walking distances (n=91, NS). A revascularization strategy resulted in 
almost twice the cost per patient compared with a noninvasive treatment approach 
($13 098 versus $6965, P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: After 5 years of follow-up, a revascularization strategy had lost 
its early benefit and did not result in any long-term improvement in 
health-related quality of life or walking capacity compared to a noninvasive 
treatment strategy. Revascularization was not a cost-effective treatment option 
from a payer/healthcare point of view.
