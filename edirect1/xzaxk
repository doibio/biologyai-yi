BACKGROUND: In patients with diabetes, delays in controlling blood pressure are 
common, but the harms of delays have not been quantified.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the harms of delays in controlling systolic blood 
pressure in middle-aged adults with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN: Decision analysis using diabetes complication equations from the United 
Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS).
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical population of adults aged 50 to 59 years old with 
newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes based on characteristics from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.
INTERVENTION: Delays in lowering systolic blood pressure from 150 (uncontrolled) 
to 130 mmHg (controlled).
MAIN MEASURES: Lifetime complication rates (amputation, congestive heart 
failure, end-stage renal disease, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke), average life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE).
KEY RESULTS: Compared to a lifetime of controlled blood pressure, a lifetime of 
uncontrolled blood pressure increased complications by 1855 events per 10,000 
patients and decreased QALE by 332 days. A 1-year delay increased complications 
by 14 events per 10,000 patients and decreased QALE by 2 days. A 10-year delay 
increased complications by 428 events per 10,000 patients and decreased QALE by 
145 days. Among complications, rates of stroke and myocardial infarction 
increased to the greatest extent due to delays. With a 20-year delay in 
achieving controlled blood pressure, a baseline blood pressure of 160 mmHg 
decreased QALE by 477 days, whereas a baseline of 140 mmHg decreased QALE by 
142 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Among middle-aged adults with diabetes, the harms of a 1-year delay 
in controlling blood pressure may be small; however, delays of ten years or more 
are expected to lower QALE to the same extent as smoking in patients with 
cardiovascular disease.

Cost-effectiveness of long-term outpatient buprenorphine-naloxone treatment for 
opioid dependence in primary care.

Street, New York, NY 10065, USA. brs2006@med.cornell.edu

BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians with appropriate training may prescribe 
buprenorphine-naloxone (bup/nx) to treat opioid dependence in US office-based 
settings, where many patients prefer to be treated. Bup/nx is off patent but not 
available as a generic.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of long-term office-based bup/nx 
treatment for clinically stable opioid-dependent patients compared to no 
treatment.
DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION: A decision analytic model simulated a 
hypothetical cohort of clinically stable opioid-dependent individuals who have 
already completed 6 months of office-based bup/nx treatment. Data were from a 
published cohort study that collected treatment retention, opioid use, and costs 
for this population, and published quality-of-life weights. Uncertainties in 
estimated monthly costs and quality-of-life weights were evaluated in 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and the economic value of additional 
research to reduce these uncertainties was also evaluated.
MAIN MEASURES: Bup/nx, provider, and patient costs in 2010 US dollars, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness (CE) 
ratios ($/QALY); costs and QALYs are discounted at 3% annually.
KEY RESULTS: In the base case, office-based bup/nx for clinically stable 
patients has a CE ratio of $35,100/QALY compared to no treatment after 
24 months, with 64% probability of being < $100,000/QALY in probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis. With a 50% bup/nx price reduction the CE ratio is 
$23,000/QALY with 69% probability of being < $100,000/QALY. Alternative 
quality-of-life weights result in CE ratios of $138,000/QALY and $90,600/QALY. 
The value of research to reduce quality-of-life uncertainties for 24-month 
results is $6,400 per person eligible for treatment at the current bup/nx price 
and $5,100 per person with a 50% bup/nx price reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Office-based bup/nx for clinically stable patients may be a 
cost-effective alternative to no treatment at a threshold of $100,000/QALY 
depending on assumptions about quality-of-life weights. Additional research 
about quality-of-life benefits and broader health system and societal cost 
savings of bup/nx therapy is needed.

BACKGROUND: Although nearly 112 million residents of the United States belong to 
a non-white ethnic group, the literature about differences in health indicators 
across ethnic groups is limited almost exclusively to Hispanics. Features of the 
social experience of many ethnic groups including immigration, discrimination, 
and acculturation may plausibly influence mortality risk. We explored life 
expectancy and age-adjusted mortality risk of Arab-Americans (AAs), relative to 
non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites in Michigan, the state with the largest per 
capita population of AAs in the US.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data were collected about all deaths to AAs and 
non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites in Michigan between 1990 and 2007, and year 
2000 census data were collected for population denominators. We calculated life 
expectancy, age-adjusted all-cause, cause-specific, and age-specific mortality 
rates stratified by ethnicity and gender among AAs and non-Arab and non-Hispanic 
Whites. Among AAs, life expectancies among men and women were 2.0 and 1.4 years 
lower than among non-Arab and non-Hispanic White men and women, respectively. AA 
men had higher mortality than non-Arab and non-Hispanic White men due to 
infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and homicide. AA women had higher 
mortality than non-Arab and non-Hispanic White women due to chronic diseases.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite better education and higher income, AAs have 
higher age-adjusted mortality risk than non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites, 
particularly due to chronic diseases. Features specific to AA culture may 
explain some of these findings.

Medicare is projected to face shortfalls by 2024. Structural changes of the 
program have been discussed, but current healthcare reform proposals have not 
included modifications that are certain to reduce expenditures. One idea that is 
gaining political traction is to advance the age of beneficiaries to match that 
of Social Security (ie, 67). This article reviews the rationale and savings 
associated with this proposal.

Abstract Objective: The aim of this study was to assess cost-effectiveness of 
the different Disease Modifying Drugs (DMD) used as first-line treatments 
(interferons IM IFNβ-1a, SC IFNβ-1a, SC IFNβ-1b, and glatiramer acetate, GA) in 
Remitting-Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) in Spain.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of a cohort of 
patients with RRMS, during a period of 10 years. Seven health states, defined by 
the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were considered in the model. 
Patients with an EDSS score less than 6.0 were assumed to be treated with one of 
the DMD. In addition, all patients were assumed to receive symptomatic 
treatment. The monthly transition probabilities of the model were obtained from 
the literature. The analysis was performed from the societal perspective, in 
which both direct and indirect (losses in productivity) healthcare costs (€, 
2010) were included. A discount rate of 3% was applied to both costs and 
efficacy results.
RESULTS: GA was the less costly strategy (€322,510), followed by IM IFNβ-1a 
(€329,595), SC IFNβ-1b (€ 333,925), and SC IFNβ-1a (€348,208). IM IFNβ-1a has 
shown the best efficacy results, with 4.176 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), 
followed by SC IFNβ-1a (4.158 QALY), SC IFNβ-1b (4.157 QALY), and GA (4.117 
QALY). Incremental costs per QALY gained with IM IFNβ-1a were €-1,005,194/QALY, 
€-223,397/QALY, and €117,914/QALY in comparison to SC IFNβ-1a, SC IFNβ-1b, and 
GA, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: First-line treatment with GA is the less costly strategy for the 
treatment of patients with RRMS. Treatment with IM IFNβ-1a is a dominant 
strategy (lower cost and higher QALY) compared with SC IFNβ-1a and SC IFNβ-1b. 
However, IM IFNβ-1a is not a cost-effective strategy vs GA, because incremental 
cost per QALY gained with IM IFNβ-1a exceeds the €30,000 per QALY threshold 
commonly used in Spain.
LIMITATIONS: The highly-restrictive inclusion criteria of clinical trials limits 
generalization of the results on efficacy to all patients with multiple 
sclerosis. Availability of data for head-to-head comparisons is associated with 
the use of information from clinical trials.

Turner syndrome is a frequent chromosome disorder in clinical practice. It is 
characterized by short stature, gonadal dysgenesia and multisystemic 
involvement, responsible for a high morbidity and reduced life expectancy. The 
aim of the present paper is to describe the endocrinopathies and major problems 
at different ages, and to present suggestion for follow-up care in these 
patients.

The Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway plays a critical role in 
wing, eye, neural tube defects, and sensory bristle development of Drosophila 
and vertebrate development. Recently, the Wnt/PCP pathway has been known to 
regulate convergent extension (CE) movements that are essential for establishing 
the three germ layers and body axis during early vertebrate development. Here, 
we describe detailed practical procedures required for the particular studies in 
Xenopus CE movements.

Institute, Puducherry.

BACKGROUND: The geriatric health problems are related to chronic disease as a 
result of increasing life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the health problems of the 
elderly in Puducherry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 214 elderly 
persons from the age group of 60 years and above using a pre-designed and 
pre-tested questionnaire that addressed the disease magnitude in comparison with 
the socioeconomic variables.
RESULTS: Overall, 43% of the participants were diabetic, 47.7% hypertensive, 86% 
anemic and 68.2% visually impaired. All the morbidities were noted to be higher 
in the 70-79 years age group. Diabetes was significantly higher in participants 
from urban areas, with family history and increasing waist-hip ratio, but 
significantly lower in the below poverty line areas. Hypertension risk was 
significantly higher among females, among those leading sedentary life, those 
eating vegetarian food, those addicted to tobacco and with abdominal obesity. 
Anemia was significantly lower among urban vegetarians. Overweight and obese 
were noted in 31% of the participants, and were higher in females (87.5%). Rural 
residence, female sex, living in joint family, literacy, sedentary life style, 
decreasing per capita income and decreasing body mass index (BMI) were 
significantly associated with visual impairment.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the burden of health problems of elderly 
individuals in South India.

Recently, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treatment has changed 
dramatically with the onset of new therapies against molecular targets replacing 
immunotherapy as standard treatment. We report the case of a 49-year-old patient 
with a moderately differentiated renal clear cell carcinoma without 
extracapsular extension who underwent radical nephrectomy. Eight months after 
surgery, he developed a thyroid metastasis which was also treated surgically 
with a hemithyroidectomy. Seventy-five months after nephrectomy, the patient 
presented an upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal metastasis that 
infiltrates the head of the pancreas. The treatment applied was surgery by 
duodenopancreatectomy, with positive surgical margins in the pathologic study. 
In addition to this, the extension study showed lung metastases requiring 
initiation of systemic treatment with sunitinib. The patient presented an 
excellent response to treatment, showing complete clinical and radiological 
response at 5 months of treatment (RECIST criteria) and a disease-free survival 
of 48 months until now, without evidence of toxicity. RCC has the potential to 
metastasize to almost any location, but thyroid and duodenal metastases in RCC 
are extremely rare. Moreover, this case also highlights the good responses that 
can be achieved in terms of disease-free survival, low toxicity and quality of 
life in this new era of therapies against molecular targets.

Wales, Australia. j.curtis@unsw.edu.au

AIM: Weight gain, obesity and metabolic disturbances in youth with psychosis are 
significant contributors to the health burden of people with psychosis, with a 
two- to threefold increase in rates compared with the general population and a 
20% reduction in life expectancy. Several studies have now described 
cardiometabolic benefits of a range of interventions, including a structured 
diet and exercise programmes and metformin for patients receiving antipsychotic 
medications. Despite the development of Australian consensus guidelines and 
screening algorithms to detect such metabolic abnormalities, there is a lack of 
guidelines for clinicians to determine appropriate, timely, targeted prevention 
and intervention to manage these complications in the youth population.
METHODS: The Bondi Early Psychosis Programme targets young people (aged 
15-25 years) experiencing their first episode of psychosis. This service has 
developed a model of metabolic screening and a treatment algorithm to provide 
clinicians with recommendations for targeted interventions.
RESULTS: Positive Cardiometabolic Health: an early intervention framework for 
patients on psychotropic medication describes a method for early detection, 
prevention and intervention strategies targeting antipsychotic-induced metabolic 
abnormalities and cardiovascular risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Although further research is required, there is sufficient evidence 
to support early intervention and prevention strategies to improve physical 
health outcomes in young people with first-episode psychosis.

Center-Houston, Houston, USA.

AIM:   Sonazoid is a new contrast agent for ultrasonography (US). 
Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using Sonazoid enables Kupffer imaging, 
which improves the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection. 
However, there are no studies on the cost-effectiveness of HCC surveillance 
using Sonazoid.
METHODS:   We constructed a Markov model simulating the natural history of 
HCV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and compared three strategies (no 
surveillance, US surveillance and CEUS surveillance). The transition probability 
and cost data were obtained from published data. The simulation and analysis 
were performed using TreeAge pro 2009 software.
RESULTS:   When compared to the no surveillance group, the US and CEUS 
surveillance groups increased the life expectancy by 1.67 and 1.99 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively, and the incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) were 17 296 $US/QALY and 18 384 $US/QALY, 
respectively. These results were both less than the commonly-accepted threshold 
of $US 50 000/QALY. Even if the CEUS surveillance group was compared with the US 
surveillance group, the ICER was $US 24 250 and thus cost-effective. Sensitivity 
analysis showed that the annual incidence of HCC and CEUS sensitivity were two 
critical parameters. However, when the annual incidence of HCC is more than 2% 
and/or the CEUS sensitivity is more than 80%, the ICER was also cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS:   Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography surveillance for HCC is a 
cost-effective strategy for LC patients and gains their longest additional life 
years, with similar degree of ICER in the US surveillance group. CEUS 
surveillance using Sonazoid is expected to be used not only in Japan, but also 
world-wide.

Cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel plus aspirin for stroke prevention in patients 
with atrial fibrillation in whom warfarin is unsuitable.

Guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend clopidogrel plus aspirin as an 
alternative stroke prevention strategy in patients in whom warfarin is 
unsuitable. A Markov model was conducted from a Medicare prospective using data 
from the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of 
Vascular Events-A (ACTIVE-A) trial and other published studies. Base-case 
analysis evaluated patients 65 years old with AF, a CHADS(2) (congestive heart 
failure, 1 point; hypertension defined as blood pressure consistently >140/90 mm 
Hg or antihypertension medication, 1 point; age ≥75 years, 1 point; diabetes 
mellitus, 1 point; previous stroke or transient ishemic attack, 2 points) score 
of 2, and a lower risk for major bleeding. Patients received clopidogrel 75 
mg/day plus aspirin or aspirin alone. Patients were followed for up to 35 years. 
Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2011 American 
dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Quality-adjusted life 
expectancy and costs were 9.37 QALYs and $88,751 with clopidogrel plus aspirin 
and 9.01 QALYs and $79,057 with aspirin alone. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for clopidogrel plus aspirin was $26,928/QALY. With 1-way sensitivity 
analysis using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, clopidogrel plus 
aspirin was no longer cost effective when the CHADS(2) score was ≤1, major 
bleeding risk with aspirin was ≥2.50%/patient-year, the relative risk decrease 
for ischemic stroke with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone was <25%, 
and the utility of being healthy with AF on combination therapy decreased to 
0.95. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that clopidogrel plus aspirin was cost 
effective in 55% and 73% of 10,000 iterations assuming willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY. In conclusion, clopidogrel plus aspirin 
appears cost-effective compared to aspirin alone for stroke prevention in 
patients with AF with a CHADS(2) of ≥2 and a lower risk of bleeding.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to explore primary care 
providers' (PCPs) perceptions about barriers to initiating insulin among 
patients. Studies suggest that many patients with poorly controlled type 2 
diabetes do not receive insulin initiation by PCPs.
METHODS: As part of the Translating Research Into Action for Diabetes study, the 
authors conducted structured interviews in health systems in Indiana, New 
Jersey, and California, asking PCPs about the importance of insulin initiation 
and factors affecting this decision. The authors calculated proportions choosing 
each multiple-choice response option and listed the most frequently offered 
open-ended response categories.
RESULTS: Among 83 PCPs, 45% were women; 60% were white; and they averaged 13.4 
years in practice. Four-fifths of PCPs endorsed guideline-concordant glycemic 
targets, but 54% individualized targets based on patient age, life expectancy, 
medical comorbidities, self-management capacity, and willingness. Most (64%) 
reported that many patients were resistant to new oral or insulin therapies due 
to fears about the therapy and what it meant about their disease progression. 
Two-thirds (64%) cited patient resistance as a barrier to insulin initiation, 
and 43% cited problems with patient self-management, including cognitive or 
mental health issues, dexterity, or ability to adhere. Eighty percent felt that 
patient nonadherence would dissuade them from initiating insulin at least some 
of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: PCPs perceived that patient resistance and poor self- management 
skills were significant barriers to initiating insulin. Future studies should

FRAX-based cost-effective intervention thresholds in the Swiss setting were 
determined. Assuming a willingness to pay at 2× Gross Domestic Product per 
capita, an intervention aimed at reducing fracture risk in women and men with a 
10-year probability for a major osteoporotic fracture at or above 15% is 
cost-effective.
INTRODUCTION: The fracture risk assessment algorithm FRAX® has been recently 
calibrated for Switzerland. The aim of the present analysis was to determine 
FRAX-based fracture probabilities at which intervention becomes cost-effective.
METHODS: A previously developed and validated state transition Markov cohort 
model was populated with Swiss epidemiological and cost input parameters. 
Cost-effective FRAX-based intervention thresholds (cost-effectiveness approach) 
and the cost-effectiveness of intervention with alendronate (original molecule) 
in subjects with a FRAX-based fracture risk equivalent to that of a woman with a 
prior fragility fracture and no other risk factor (translational approach) were 
calculated based on the Swiss FRAX model and assuming a willingness to pay of 2 
times Gross Domestic Product per capita for one Quality-adjusted Life-Year.
RESULTS: In Swiss women and men aged 50 years and older, drug intervention aimed 
at decreasing fracture risk was cost-effective with a 10-year probability for a 
major osteoporotic fracture at or above 13.8% (range 10.8% to 15.0%) and 15.1% 
(range 9.9% to 19.9%), respectively. Age-dependent variations around these mean 
values were modest. Using the translational approach, treatment was 
cost-effective or cost-saving after the age 60 years in women and 55 in men who 
had previously sustained a fragility fracture. Using the latter approach leads 
to considerable underuse of the current potential for cost-effective 
interventions against fractures.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a FRAX-based intervention threshold of 15% for both women and 
men should permit cost-effective access to therapy to patients at high fracture 
probability based on clinical risk factors and thereby contribute to further 
reduce the growing burden of osteoporotic fractures in Switzerland.

Portugal. Health system review.

Barros PP(1), Machado SR, Simões Jde A.

The Portuguese population enjoys good health and increasing life expectancy, 
though at lower levels than other western European countries. All residents in 
Portugal have access to health care provided by the National Health Service 
(NHS), financed mainly through taxation. Co-payments have been increasing over 
time, and the level of cost-sharing is highest for pharmaceutical products. 
Approximately one-fifth to a quarter of the population enjoys a second (or more) 
layer of health insurance coverage through health subsystems and voluntary 
health insurance (VHI). Health care delivery is based on both public and private 
providers. Public provision is predominant in primary care and hospital care, 
with a gatekeeping system in place for the former. Pharmaceutical products, 
diagnostic technologies and private practice by physicians constitute the bulk 
of private health care provision. The Portuguese health system has not undergone 
any major changes on the financing side since the early 1990s, despite the 
steady growth of public health expenditure. On the other hand, many measures 
have been adopted to improve the performance of the health system, including 
public private partnerships (PPPs) for new hospitals, a change in NHS hospital 
management structures, pharmaceutical reforms, the reorganization of primary 
care and the creation of long-term care networks. Some of these measures have 
faced opposition from the (local) population, namely those related to the 
closure of health care facilities. There is an overall awareness, and concern, 
about the rise in health care expenditure in Portugal. Most of the reforms that 
have come into effect have done so too recently to measure any effects at 
present (January 2011).

A 21-year-old man presented with generalized erythema, erosions and 
hyperkeratoses since birth. Histology revealed epidermolytic hyperkeratosis with 
degeneration of the upper epidermis and perinuclear deposits of abnormal keratin 
aggregations. Epidermolytic ichthyosis was diagnosed. This congenital Ichthyosis 
occurs due to mutations of keratin 1 or 10 genes that leads to defects of intra- 
and intercellular structural integrity in the spinous and granular layers with 
compensatory hyperkeratosis. After childhood, life expectancy is normal but 
lifelong therapeutic and skin care measures are required.

OBJECTIVES: Internal organ involvement reduces the life expectancy of SSc 
patients. Cardiopulmonary manifestations are currently the primary cause of 
death. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to define more 
precise effect estimates of different cardiopulmonary manifestations and to 
verify trends in the mortality of SSc.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify relevant 
cohort studies. Reports analyzing the role of the organ manifestations in 
mortality or analysing survival compared with the control population were 
included. The outcome parameters were pooled with the random-effect model via 
generic inverse-variance weighting in conventional and cumulative meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies comprising a total of 12, 829 patients qualified. The 
reported causes of death were as follows: 19.7% cardiac, 16.8% interstitial 
pulmonary disease, 13.1% pulmonary hypertension and 13.8% renal disease. The 
risk of death was significantly increased in patients with cardiac involvement 
[hazard ratio (HR) 3.15], with pulmonary interstitial disease (HR 2.58), with 
pulmonary hypertension (HR 3.50) and with renal manifestations (HR 2.76). A 
trend for survival improvement (R2)= 0.4295, P = 0.04) was found, and the 
difference in survival between the diffuse and limited scleroderma subgroups was 
diminishing (R2)= 0.4119. P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis of observational studies indicates a trend for 
improvement over the last decades in which the life expectancy of SSc patients 
approaches that of the general population. A decreasing tendency in the survival 
differences between the limited and diffuse SSc subgroups was also verified. 
Internal organ involvements have similarly unfavourable predictive impact on 
survival.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that has 
significant impact on the health, quality of life and life expectancy, as well 
as on the health care system. Butea monosperma Lam. Kuntze (Fabaceae), commonly 
known as palash, is widely used in the treatment of various diseases and 
disorders including diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was planned to evaluate the 
antidiabetic effect of aqueous extracts of B. monosperma leaves and bark in 
streptozotocin-induced severely diabetic rats. The animals were divided into 
four groups, with each consisting of six rats, viz. control, diabetic control, 
leaf extract-treated and bark extract-treated groups. Treatment was continued 
for 6 weeks. The biochemical estimations included blood glucose and serum 
insulin levels. Histopathology of pancreas was also performed.
RESULTS: The results indicated that both leaf and bark extracts of B. monosperma 
produced insignificant antihyperglycemic activity. The leaf and bark extracts 
reduced blood glucose to an extent of 28% and 11%, respectively. It was also 
evidenced that both leaf and bark extracts did not increase insulin synthesis or 
secretion and did not improve pancreatic architecture as reflected by the 
histopathologic studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study emphasize that B. monosperma does not 
possess significant antidiabetic activity in severe experimental diabetes at the 
dosage tested.

Incidence and causes of perioperative mortality after primary surgery for 
intracranial tumors: a national, population-based study.

    J Neurosurg. 2012 Apr;116(4):821-2; discussion 822-4.

OBJECT: Surgical mortality is a frequent outcome measure in studies of 
volume-outcome relationships, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
has endorsed surgical mortality after craniotomies as an Inpatient Quality 
Indicator. Still, the frequency and causes of 30-day mortality after 
neurosurgical procedures have not been much explored. The authors sought to 
study the frequency and possible causes of death following primary intracranial 
tumor operations. They also sought to explore a possible predictive value of 
perioperative mortality rates from neurosurgical centers in relation to 
long-term survival.
METHODS: Using population-based data from the Norwegian cancer registry, the 
authors identified 15,918 primary operations for primary CNS tumors treated in 
Norway in the period from August 1955 through December 2008. Patients were 
followed up until death, emigration, or September 2009. Causes of mortality as 
indicated on death certificates were studied. Factors associated with an 
increased risk of perioperative death were identified.
RESULTS: The overall risk of perioperative death after first-time surgery for 
primary intracranial tumors is currently 2.2% and has decreased over the last 
decades. An age ≥ 70 years and histopathological entities with poor long-term 
prognoses are risk factors. Overlapping lesions are also associated with excess 
risk, indicating that lesion size or multifocality may matter. The overall risk 
of perioperative death is also higher in biopsy cases than in resection cases. 
Perioperative mortality rates of the 4 Norwegian neurosurgical centers were not 
predictive of their respective long-term survival rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Although considered surgically related if they occur within the 
first 30 days of surgery, most early postoperative deaths can happen independent 
of the handiwork of the operating surgeon or anesthesiologist. Overall prognosis 
of the disease seems to be a strong predictor of perioperative death-perhaps not 
surprisingly since the 30-day mortality rate is merely the intonation of the 
Kaplan-Meier curve. Both referral and treatment policies at a neurosurgical 
center will therefore markedly affect such early outcomes, but early deaths may 
not necessarily reflect overall quality of care or long-term results. The low 
incidence of perioperative death in intracranial tumor surgery also greatly 
limits the statistical power in comparative analyses, such as between published 
patient series or between centers and certainly between surgeons. Therefore the 
authors question the value of perioperative mortality rates as a quality 
indicator in modern neurosurgery for tumors.

Health inequalities, which have been well documented for decades, have more 
recently become policy targets in developed countries. This review describes 
time trends in health inequalities (by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic 
status), commitments to reduce health inequalities, and progress made to 
eliminate health inequalities in the United States, United Kingdom, and other 
OECD countries. Time-trend data in the United States indicate a narrowing of the 
gap between the best- and worst-off groups in some health indicators, such as 
life expectancy, but a widening of the gap in others, such as diabetes 
prevalence. Similarly, time-trend data in the United Kingdom indicate a 
narrowing of the gap between the best- and worst-off groups in some indicators, 
such as hypertension prevalence, whereas the gap between social classes has 
increased for life expectancy. More research and better methods are needed to 
measure precisely the relationships between stated policy goals and observed 
trends in health inequalities.

Maryland 21287, USA. sderamirez@jhmi.edu

The World Health Organization estimates injuries accounted for more than 5 
million deaths in 2004, significantly impacting the global burden of disease. 
Nearly 3.9 million of these deaths were due to unintentional injury, a cause 
also responsible for more than 138 million disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) lost in the same year. More than 90% of the DALYs lost occur in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), highlighting the disproportionate burden that 
injuries place on developing countries. This article examines the health and 
social impact of injury, injury data availability, and injury prevention 
interventions. By proposing initiatives to minimize the magnitude of death and 
disability due to unintentional injuries, particularly in LMICs, this review 
serves as a call to action for further investment in injury surveillance, 
prevention interventions, and health systems strengthening.

Clinical trials may furnish data to conduct economic analyses. An economic 
analysis requires us to identify all opportunity costs associated with the 
intervention over the time horizon chosen for the analysis and enumerate the 
improvements in benefits from the intervention of interest. We review the basic 
steps used when performing economic studies based on secondary analysis of data 
from clinical trials using examples from myocardial infarction studies. 
Different types of economic analyses and the potential contributions of Markov 
modeling are described. Issues of measuring quality of life, patient utilities, 
cost of care, and potential sources of cost data are reviewed. The 
interpretation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios is discussed and 
economic benchmarks for defining good and poor value interventions are provided.

The impact of adjunctive iliac stenting on femoral-femoral bypass in 
contemporary practice.

OBJECTIVES: Most reports of femoral-femoral bypass (FFB) were published before 
the era of endovascular intervention. This study examines the utilization and 
impact of adjunctive endovascular intervention on FFB in contemporary practice.
METHODS: We reviewed 253 FFB performed in 247 patients between 1984 and 2010. 
Primary endpoints, including graft patency, primary-assisted patency, limb 
salvage, and survival, were assessed using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictors of 
primary endpoints.
RESULTS: The indication for FFB included claudication (27%; n = 69) and critical 
limb ischemia (72%; n = 184). Forty-eight patients (19%) were treated urgently 
for acute ischemia. Mean follow-up was 5.6 ± 5.5 years. Over the study interval, 
adjunctive iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)/stent placement 
increased significantly from 0% to 54% (P trend < .001), while the rate of 
axillofemoral bypass or no inflow procedure decreased from 100% to 46% (P trend 
< .001). Despite increased utilization, iliac PTA/stenting was associated with 
decreased 5-year primary graft patency of 44% compared with 74% for 
axillofemoral bypass patients and 71% in patients with no adjunctive inflow 
procedure (P = .004). Patients with inflow iliac PTA/stents also had diminished 
5-year assisted primary patency of 61% compared with 85% for axillofemoral 
bypass patients and 87% in patients without inflow revascularization (P = .002). 
Adjunctive iliac PTA/stenting did not impact limb salvage or overall survival. 
Five-year primary patency among claudicants and critical leg ischemia patients 
was 65% and 68%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of iliac PTA/stent placement in conjunction with FFB 
has increased significantly over time in contemporary practice. Reliance on 
iliac stent placement for FFB inflow is paradoxically associated with both 
diminished primary and assisted primary graft patency when compared with 
historical controls. These findings highlight the importance of patient 
selection and inflow consideration when performing FFB.

Luteolin enhances cholinergic activities in PC12 cells through ERK1/2 and 
PI3K/Akt pathways.

Luteolin, a 3', 4', 5, 7-tetrahydroxyflavone, is an active compound in 
Rosmarinus officinalis (Lamiacea), and has been reported to exert several 
benefits in neuronal cells. However cholinergic-induced activities of luteolin 
still remain unknown. Neuronal differentiation encompasses an elaborate 
developmental program which plays a key role in the development of the nervous 
system. The advent of several cell lines, like PC12 cells, able to differentiate 
in culture proved to be the turning point for gaining and understanding of 
molecular neuroscience. In this work, we investigated the ability of luteolin to 
induce PC12 cell differentiation and its effect on cholinergic activities. Our 
findings showed that luteolin treatment significantly induced neurite outgrowth 
extension, enhanced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, known as neuronal 
differentiation marker, and increased the level of total choline and 
acetylcholine in PC12 cells. In addition, luteolin persistently, activated 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt; while the addition 
of pharmacological MEK/ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) and PI3k/Akt inhibitor 
(LY294002) attenuated luteolin-induced AChE activity and neurite outgrowth in 
PC12 cells. The above findings suggest that luteolin induces neurite outgrowth 
and enhanced cholinergic activities, at least in part, through the activation of 
ERK1/2 and Akt signaling.
