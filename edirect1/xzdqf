Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and its prevalence is 
projected to increase in the coming years in parallel with the increase of life 
expectancy. Despite the great improvements in the management of the acute phase 
of stroke, some residual disability persists in most patients thus requiring 
rehabilitation. One third of patients do not reach the maximal recovery 
potential and different approaches have been explored with the aim to boost up 
recovery. In this regard, noninvasive brain stimulation techniques have been 
widely used to induce neuroplasticity phenomena. Different protocols of 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial electrical 
stimulation (tES) can induce short- and long-term changes of synaptic 
excitability and are promising tools for enhancing recovery in stroke patients. 
New options for neuromodulation are currently under investigation. They include: 
vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) that can be delivered invasively, with implanted 
stimulators and noninvasively with transcutaneous VNS (tVNS); and extremely 
low-frequency (1-300Hz) magnetic fields. This chapter will provide an overview 
on the new techniques that are used for neuroprotection and for enhancing 
recovery after stroke.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) following Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly 
variable. The literature to date is limited by smaller sample sizes and clinical 
diagnoses.
OBJECTIVE: No study to date has evaluated predictors of AD LE in a retrospective 
large autopsy-confirmed sample, which was the primary objective of this study.
METHODS: Participants (≥50 years old) clinically and neuropathologically 
diagnosed with AD were evaluated using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 
(N = 1,401) data. Analyses focused on 21 demographic, medical, neuropsychiatric, 
neurological, functional, and global cognitive predictors of LE at AD dementia 
diagnosis. These 21 predictors were evaluated in univariate analyses. Variables 
found to be significant were then entered into a forward multiple regression. LE 
was defined as months between AD diagnosis and death.
RESULTS: Fourteen predictors were significant in univariate analyses and entered 
into the regression. Seven predictors explained 27% of LE variance in 764 total 
participants. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was the strongest 
predictor of LE, followed by sex, age, race/ethnicity, neuropsychiatric 
symptoms, abnormal neurological exam results, and functional impairment ratings. 
Post-hoc analyses revealed correlations of LE were strongest with MMSE ≤12.
CONCLUSION: Global cognitive functioning was the strongest predictor of LE 
following diagnosis, and AD patients with severe impairment had the shortest LE. 
AD patients who are older, male, white, and have more motor symptoms, functional 
impairment, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were also more likely have shorter LE. 
While this model cannot provide individual prognoses, additional studies may 
focus on these variables to enhance predictions of LE in patients with AD.

Complete or improving civil registration systems in sub-national areas in low- 
and middle-income countries provide several opportunities to better understand 
population health and its determinants. In this article, we provide an 
assessment of vital statistics in Kerala, India. Kerala is home to more than 33 
million people and is a comparatively low-mortality context. We use 
individual-level vital registration data on more than 2.8 million deaths between 
2006 and 2017 from the Kerala MARANAM (Mortality and Registration Assessment and 
Monitoring) Study. Comparing age-specific mortality rates from the Civil 
Registration System (CRS) to those from the Sample Registration System (SRS), we 
do not find evidence that the CRS underestimates mortality. Instead, CRS rates 
are smoother across ages and less variable across periods. In particular, the 
CRS records higher death rates than the SRS for ages, where mortality is usually 
low and for women. Using these data, we provide the first set of annual 
sex-specific life tables for any state in India. We find that life expectancy at 
birth was 77.9 years for women in 2017 and 71.4 years for men. Although Kerala 
is unique in many ways, our findings strengthen the case for more careful 
attention to mortality records within low- and middle-income countries, and for 
their better dissemination by government agencies.

Normalized lifespan inequality: disentangling the longevity-lifespan variability 
nexus.

Previous studies have documented a historically strong and negative association 
between countries' life expectancy (i.e., average longevity) and length-of-life 
inequality (i.e., variability in ages at death). The relationship between both 
variables might be partially explained by life expectancy increasing at a faster 
pace than maximal length of life, a phenomenon that mechanically compresses the 
age-at-death distribution and has not been taken into consideration in previous 
studies. In this paper, we propose a new approach to lifespan inequality 
measurement that accounts for the (uncertainly) bounded nature of 
length-of-life. Applying the new approach to the countries of the Human 
Mortality Database, we observe that the decline in overall lifespan variability 
typically associated with increases in longevity seems to stop and even reverse 
at higher levels of life expectancy. This suggests the emergence of worrying 
ethical dilemmas, whereby higher achievements in longevity would only be 
possible at the expense of higher lifespan variability.

Contribution of causal factors to disease burden: how to interpret attributable 
fractions.

Counil E(1).

Author information:

What proportion of the risk in a given population is attributable to a risk 
factor? The population attributable fraction (PAF) answers this question. 
"Attributable to" is understood as "due to", which makes PAFs closely related to 
the concept of potential impact or potential benefits of reducing the exposure. 
The PAF is a tool at the border between science and decision making. PAFs are 
estimated based on strong assumptions and the calculations are data intensive, 
making them vulnerable to gaps in knowledge and data. Current misconceptions 
include summing up PAFs to 100% or subtracting a PAF for a factor from 100% to 
deduce what proportion is left to be explained or prevented by other factors. 
This error is related to unrecognised multicausality or shared causal 
responsibility in disease aetiology. Attributable cases only capture cases in 
excess and should be regarded as a lower bound for aetiological cases, which 
cannot be estimated based on epidemiological data alone (exposure-induced 
cases). The population level might not be relevant to discuss prevention 
priorities based on PAFs, for instance when exposures concentrate in a subgroup 
of the population, as for occupational lung carcinogens and other workplace 
hazards. Alternative approaches have been proposed based on absolute rather than 
relative metrics, such as estimating potential gains in life expectancy that can 
be expected from a specific policy (prevention) or years of life lost due to a 
specific exposure that already happened (compensation).

Application of Smart Healthcare in LTCI, Outpatient Mutual-Aid Guarantee 
Mechanism, and Sustainability of Medical Insurance Fund for Urban Employees.

Ren Y(1), Yang Z(1).

Author information:

With the aggravation of population aging and the increase of life expectancy, 
long-term care insurance (LTCI) system has been established to meet the medical 
and long-term care needs of the increasing elderly population. In China, LTCI 
system is currently not a stand-alone insurance, but it is attached to the 
national basic medical insurance fund for urban employees (MIUE). As a result, 
the expenditure of LTCI is a part of the expenditure of the MIUE, which has an 
impact on the sustainability of the MIUE. By modeling the income and expenditure 
of MIUE, especially including the expenditure of LTCI, this study optimized an 
LTCI system with a higher individual out-of-pocket payment ratio of LTCI and 
implementation of the outpatient mutual-aid guarantee mechanism (OMAGM), which 
could improve the sustainability of the MIUE. The study also reveals the 
following: (i) solely increasing individual out-of-pocket payment ratio of LTCI 
to 20%-50% can only postpone the deficit on Social Pooling Accounts (SPAs) by 1 
or 2 years, and the effect is very limited. (ii) Besides a higher individual 
out-of-pocket payment ratio, further implementation of a partial OMAGM from 2022 
will postpone the deficit on SPAs by 7-9 years, and the implementation of a 
complete OMAGM from 2022 will postpone the deficit by 14-18 years. Accordingly, 
China should implement OMAGM as soon as possible to enhance the solvency of MIUE 
fund, and, in the long run, an independent LTCI scheme should be established to 
ensure the stability and sustainability of the LTCI fund and the MIUE fund.

BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff (RC) tears are one of the most frequent pathologies 
within the shoulder girdle. Hand dominance and older age are associated with RC 
tears. Two different surgical procedures, the mini-open (MO) and 
all-arthroscopic (AA) approach, represented the standard of treatment.
AIM: To compare the clinical and biomechanical outcomes of two surgical 
techniques (AA vs MO procedure) performed to address the painful shoulder 
syndrome with partial or total supraspinatus tendon tear.
METHODS: Eighty-eight participants, 50 following RC repair with AA and 38 with 
MO approach, were recruited in the present cross-sectional case-control study 
(ORTHO-SHOULDER, Prot. 0054602). All patients underwent postoperative clinical 
evaluation for pain (Visual analogic scale), impairment, and disability 
(disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand) and limitation in daily activity 
(Constant-Murley score). Patients' shoulder mobility was also assessed in our 
Laboratory of Functional Movement through a wearable inertial sensor and surface 
electromyography to monitor kinematics and muscle activity during the movement 
on the frontal (abduction/adduction) and sagittal (flexion-extension) planes.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences between the two procedures 
were observed in either main clinical score or range of motion. A significant 
increase in velocity during the movement execution and a higher contribution of 
upper trapezius muscles were found in the AA group compared with MO patients.
CONCLUSION: In terms of clinical scores, our findings were in line with previous 
results. However, the use of technology-based assessment of shoulder mobility 
has revealed significant differences between the two techniques in terms of mean 
velocity and pattern of muscle activation.

Cardiovascular disease, a major global burden: Epidemiology of stroke and 
ischemic heart disease in Japan.

Japan ranks the highest globally, in terms of longevity. The average life 
expectancy was 81.4 years for men and 87.5 years for women in 2019. Such success 
in health is attributable to the substantial reduction in age-standardized 
mortality from cardiovascular diseases, especially stroke (136 per 105 in 1980 
and 24 per 105 in 2015), when stroke mortality was the highest in the world 
between the 1960s and the 1990s. On the other hand, ischemic heart disease 
mortality was the lowest in the world between the 1960s and the 1980s and has 
continued to decline (40 per 105 in 1980 and 17 per 105 in 2015). Such a disease 
profile (larger burden of stroke compared to ischemic heart disease) was 
observed not only in Japan but also in some countries in central Asia and 
Africa, where small vessel disease (arteriolosclerosis) is assumed to be more 
common than large vessel disease (atherosclerosis). Between 1970 and 2015, a 
large decline in the population with high blood pressure levels was observed for 
both men and women. Meanwhile, there was a moderate decline in the smoking rate 
among men, and an increasing trend in serum cholesterol levels in both men and 
women. The sharp and extensive socioeconomic development between the 1960s and 
1990s contributed to these health outcomes, while preventive measures and 
improved emergency medical care also contributed to the reduction of risk 
factors, disease incidence, case-fatality, and mortality. However, there is a 
threat of increasing incidence of ischemic heart disease in urban male employees 
and middle-aged male residents. Japan, with a super-aging society, needs to 
develop a new model for the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease and 
related health issues, with emphasis on efforts towards the early (primordial) 
prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as the attenuation of their 
progress towards chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and vascular 
dementia.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status has an important effect on cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Data on the economic implications of CVD by socioeconomic status 
are needed to inform healthcare planning.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to project new-onset CVD and related 
health economic outcomes in Australia by socioeconomic status from 2021 to 2030.
METHODS: A dynamic population model was built to project annual new-onset CVD by 
socioeconomic quintile in Australians aged 40-79 years from 2021 to 2030. 
Cardiovascular risk was estimated using the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE) from 
Australian-specific data, stratified for each socioeconomic quintile. The model 
projected years of life lived, quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs), acute 
healthcare medical costs, and productivity losses due to new-onset CVD. All 
outcomes were discounted by 5% annually.
RESULTS: PCE estimates showed that 8.4% of people in the most disadvantaged 
quintile were at high risk of CVD, compared with 3.7% in the least disadvantaged 
quintile (p < 0.001). From 2021 to 2030, the model projected 32% more 
cardiovascular events in the most disadvantaged quintile compared with the least 
disadvantaged (127,070 in SE 1 vs. 96,222 in SE 5). Acute healthcare costs in 
the most disadvantaged quintile were Australian dollars (AU$) 183 million higher 
than the least disadvantaged, and the difference in productivity costs was 
AU$959 million. Removing the equity gap (by applying the cardiovascular risk 
from the least disadvantaged quintile to the whole population) would prevent 
114,822 cardiovascular events and save AU$704 million of healthcare costs and 
AU$3844 million of lost earnings over the next 10 years.
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the pressing need to implement primary 
prevention interventions to reduce cardiovascular health inequity. This model 
provides a platform to incorporate socioeconomic status into health economic 
models by estimating which interventions are likely to yield more benefits in 
each socioeconomic quintile.

Down Syndrome or trisomy 21 (T21) is a genetic condition caused by the presence 
of an extra chromosome in pair 21 and is related to a high prevalence of 
agenesis of permanent teeth and periodontal alterations that may be associated 
to the loss of permanent teeth at early ages. With the increase in life 
expectancy of people with T21 in the last decades, it is necessary to expand the 
knowledge to offer possibilities of treatment with dental implants, aiming to 
serve this aging population.
AIMS: The aim of this article is to report a surgical procedure of sinus lift to 
enable the installation of dental implants in the posterior region of the 
maxilla.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A 50 year-old patient with T21 was rehabilitated with 
implants, simultaneously with sinus lift surgery, by the lateral window 
technique, using xenogenous bone graft and fibrin-rich plasma. After 1 year, the 
patient was rehabilitated with prosthetics on implants.
CONCLUSION: The feasibility of this technique in patients with Down syndrome 
could be observed, after 3 years of follow up, with favorable clinical results.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: To identify the optimal cost-effectiveness 
threshold of post-void residual (PVR) by bladder scan in postoperative 
urogynecologic patients.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed as a secondary analysis of 
a previously published study of patients undergoing urogynecologic procedures 
with planned voiding trials, setting thresholds for postoperative PVR bladder 
scan volumes at 100 ml, 150 ml, and 200 ml. Patient-based scenarios were modeled 
for ambulatory office or emergency department (ED) resource utilization and to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of each threshold. Costs were obtained from a 
southeastern academic medical center, only utilizing direct medical costs and 
hospital costs, not including societal costs. Quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY's) were used as health outcomes determining the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: A total of 151 patients from the original study were included. A 
willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY was assumed. A PVR of 100 ml 
exceeded this at $373,824. A PVR threshold of 150 ml was dominant (-$1,211,716), 
while minimizing ED visits for postoperative urinary retention (POUR) and 
unnecessary clinic appointments. While a PVR of 200 ml appeared a cost-effective 
strategy (-$488,389), there was increased ED utilization and under-detection of 
postoperative urinary retention (POUR).
CONCLUSION: A PVR threshold of 100 ml created a healthcare system burden due to 
increased office voiding trials. Both PVR thresholds of 150 ml and 200 ml were 
cost-effective strategies; however, ED utilization for POUR increased with 
200 ml. Utilizing 150 ml as the PVR cut-off proved the most cost-effective 
strategy, avoiding POUR under-detection and undue health costs.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) creates a significant economic burden 
on patients and society. The DAPA-CKD trial reports the benefit of dapagliflozin 
in CKD patients; however, its cost-effectiveness is unknown in Thailand. This 
study evaluated the cost-utility of dapagliflozin in addition to standard of 
care (SoC) compared with SoC alone in CKD patients.
METHODS: A Markov model was employed to estimate lifetime costs, life-years, and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), with the modeled population aligned to the 
baseline characteristics of a DAPA-CKD trial, from a societal perspective. 
Effectiveness inputs were obtained from the DAPA-CKD trial. Costs and most 
utility data were gathered from published studies conducted in Thailand. Costs 
and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. A series of sensitivity analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, add-on dapagliflozin was estimated to increase 
life-years by 0.34 and QALY by 0.30 in comparison with SoC alone (7.13 vs. 
6.78 years, 5.10 vs. 4.80 QALYs). Total cost was lower under dapagliflozin 
treatment than SoC treatment (648,413 THB vs. 689,284 THB or 20,947.64 USD vs. 
22,268.01 USD). Cost saving occurred as a result of the lower costs of dialysis 
and KT. The findings were robust to the changes of inputs.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the DAPA-CKD trial, the add-on dapagliflozin 
results in cost saving compared favorably with SoC alone in Thailand. The 
benefit of dapagliflozin in delayed CKD progression is that it reduces the 
requirement for dialysis and KT, which can offset the costs of dapagliflozin and 
early CKD treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Various therapies and drugs have been developed to extend the life 
expectancy of patients with liver cirrhosis. The prolonged prognosis of 
cirrhotic patients may change the final cause of death in the future. Deep 
bleeding into the muscle is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening 
complication of liver cirrhosis.
CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old man had undergone transjugular intrahepatic 
portosystemic shunt treatment for refractory ascites, which successfully 
controlled it for three years. However, he had started drinking again and 
experienced acute-on-chronic liver failure. He also had severe back pain. 
Abdominal computed tomography showed hyperdensities in the retroperitoneum and 
right pleural cavity. Despite blood infusion, he died from acute-on-chronic 
liver failure. A pathological autopsy revealed bleeding from the iliopsoas and 
right diaphragmatic muscle simultaneously, evident from the presence of red 
blood cells located between the muscle sheaths. Disruption of the small vessels 
in the skeletal muscle fibers was inferred.
CONCLUSION: This is a critical case that underscores the significance of 
improving available knowledge based on the cause of final death of the patients 
with cirrhosis, who now have a good long-term prognosis owing to the latest 
medical developments.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of delirium, 
using the Assessment Test for Delirium and Cognitive Impairment (4AT) in 
end-of-life palliative care patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 
end-of-life patients in a hospice or at home. All patients were evaluated with 
the 4AT for the presence of delirium.
RESULTS: Of the 461 patients analyzed, 76 (16.5%) were inpatients and 83.5% 
(385) outpatients. The median age was 79.5 (72-86) years, and 51.0% were female. 
According to the 4AT score, 126 patients (27.3%) had delirium (A4T ≥4) at 
admission, 28 (36.8%) were inpatients, and 98 (25.5%) outpatients. Around 33.8% 
of the cancer inpatients had delirium, while 20.6% of the cancer outpatients had 
delirium. The prevalence of delirium varied according to the setting, clinical 
condition, and life expectancy. In addition, 55.0% (11) actively dying 
inpatients, within 3 days, had delirium, and 56.7% (17) outpatients had 
delirium; while among those with life expectancy longer than 4 days, 30.4% (17) 
inpatients and 22.8% (81) outpatients were with delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that delirium is common in cancer and noncancer 
palliative care patients. Further research on delirium in end-of-life palliative 
care patients should consider the complexity of palliative care of this 
population as well as of the characteristics of the settings.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability and a source of 
societal costs among older adults, especially with an increasingly obese 
population. However, very few published studies have investigated the burden of 
knee and hip OA due to a high body mass index (BMI). Therefore, this study aimed 
to systematically summarize the trends of knee and hip OA due to a high BMI in 
China and the USA between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were used to estimate 
the age-standardized prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates of 
knee and hip OA, and the burden of knee and hip OA due to a high BMI by sex. 
Joinpoint regression analysis was used to determine the temporal trend changes 
in the related DALYs rates of knee and hip OA.
RESULTS: The trends in the DALYs rates of knee OA due to a high BMI have shown a 
steady and large increase in China, while the trends first showed an increase 
followed by a large decrease near 2001-2005 and finally a steady increase in the 
USA. The trends in the DALYs rates of hip OA due to a high BMI have shown a 
steady and large increase in both men and women in China and the USA from 1990 
to 2019. For the comparison by age categories from 30 to 34 years to 90-94 years 
in 2019, the age-standardized DALYs rates due to a high BMI first increased and 
then decreased after 60-64 years and 70-74 years in both men and women from 
China and the USA for knee OA, respectively. For hip OA, the age-standardized 
DALYs rates first increased and then decreased after 70-74 years in both men and 
women from China and the USA.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of knee and hip OA due to a high BMI is substantially 
increasing in China and the USA in recent years. Researchers and health policy 
makers should assess the changing patterns of high BMI on the burden of OA and 
devise corresponding weight-control strategies.

BACKGROUND: People with a mental health condition have a shorter life expectancy 
than the general population. This is largely attributable to higher rates of 
chronic disease and a higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviours 
including tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, and physical 
inactivity. Telephone support services offer a viable option to provide support 
to reduce these health risk behaviours at a population-level; however, whilst 
there is some research pertaining to Quitlines, there is limited other research 
investigating whether telephone services may offer effective support for people 
with a mental health condition. This protocol describes a randomised controlled 
trial that aims to evaluate the referral of people with a mental health 
condition to a population-level telephone coaching service to increase physical 
activity, healthy eating, or weight management, and increase attempts to do so.
METHODS: A parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be conducted 
recruiting participants with a mental health condition through community mental 
health services and advertisement on social media. Participants will be randomly 
assigned to receive either a health information pack only (control) or a health 
information pack and a proactive referral to a free, government-funded telephone 
coaching service, the NSW Get Healthy Coaching and Information Service® 
(intervention), which offers up to 13 telephone coaching calls with a University 
Qualified Health Coach to assist with client-identified goals relating to 
physical activity, healthy eating, weight management, or alcohol reduction. Data 
will be collected via telephone surveys at baseline and 6 months 
post-recruitment. Primary outcomes are as follows: (1) minutes of moderate to 
vigorous physical activity per week, (2) serves of fruit consumed per day, (3) 
serves of vegetables consumed per day, and (4) a composite measure assessing 
attempts to change at least one health risk behaviour (any attempts to change 
physical activity, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, or other parts of 
nutrition). Secondary outcomes include weight and body mass index.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of referral to 
a population-level telephone support service for reducing health risk behaviours 
relating to physical activity, healthy eating, and weight in people with a 
mental health condition. Results will inform future policy and practice 
regarding the delivery of telephone-based behaviour change coaching services and 
the management of physical health for this population to reduce health inequity 
and the burden of chronic disease.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LEGO-based therapy compared with 
usual support.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis alongside randomised control trial.
SETTING: Mainstream primary and secondary schools in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: 248 children and young people (CYP) with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) aged 7-15 years.
INTERVENTION: LEGO-based therapy is a group social skills intervention designed 
specifically for CYP with ASD. Through play, CYP learn to use the skills such as 
joint attention, sharing, communication and group problem-solving. CYP 
randomised to the intervention arm received 12 weekly sessions of LEGO-based 
therapy and usual support, while CYP allocated to control arm received usual 
support only.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Average costs based on National Health Service (NHS) and 
personal social services perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
measured by EQ-5D-Y over time horizon of 1 year were collected during the trial. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, and non-parametric 
bootstrapping was conducted. The uncertainty around the ICER estimates was 
presented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). A set of 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the primary 
findings.
RESULTS: After adjustment and bootstrapping, on average, CYP in LEGO-based 
therapy group incurred less costs (incremental cost was -£251 (95% CI -£752 to 
£268)) and gained marginal improvement in QALYs (QALYs gained 0.009 (95% CI 
-0.008 to 0.028)). The CEAC shows that the probability of LEGO-based therapy 
being cost-effective was 94% at the willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per 
QALY gained. Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Compared with usual support, LEGO-based therapy produced marginal 
reduction in costs and improvement in QALYs. Results from both primary and 
sensitivity analyses suggested that LEGO-based therapy was likely to be 
cost-effective.

Despite the structural and functional information contained in the statistical 
coupling between pairs of residues in a protein, coevolution associated with 
function is often obscured by artifactual signals such as genetic drift, which 
shapes a protein's phylogenetic history and gives rise to concurrent variation 
between protein sequences that is not driven by selection for function. Here, we 
introduce a background model for phylogenetic contributions of statistical 
coupling that separates the coevolution signal due to inter-clade and 
intra-clade sequence comparisons and demonstrate that coevolution can be 
measured on multiple phylogenetic timescales within a single protein. Our 
method, nested coevolution (NC), can be applied as an extension to any 
coevolution metric. We use NC to demonstrate that poorly conserved residues can 
nonetheless have important roles in protein function. Moreover, NC improved the 
structural-contact predictions of several coevolution-based methods, 
particularly in subsampled alignments with fewer sequences. NC also lowered the 
noise in detecting functional sectors of collectively coevolving residues. 
Sectors of coevolving residues identified after application of NC were more 
spatially compact and phylogenetically distinct from the rest of the protein, 
and strongly enriched for mutations that disrupt protein activity. Thus, our 
conceptualization of the phylogenetic separation of coevolution provides the 
potential to further elucidate relationships among protein evolution, function, 
and genetic diseases.

This study investigates the long-term dynamics of longevity by taking into 
account the specific contribution of each country, and how this has changed over 
time, thus highlighting different timing and speeds of the evolution of life 
expectancy among the low-lowest mortality countries. Leveraging on quantile 
regression, we analyze the specific position of countries that have recorded the 
maximum (BPLE) and second-best life expectancy value at least once in the period 
1960-2014, both at ages 0 and 65. Moving in this direction, the purpose of our 
contribution is to provide new perspectives on the untracked behavior that may 
be overshadowed by the maximum longevity levels. Our results provide a 
comprehensive picture of the different phases and transitions experienced by 
developed countries in the evolution of life expectancy that has led to a 
continuous increase in the BPLE. This study is a prominent practice in detecting 
untracked behaviors, providing imminent onsets on the maximum and sub-maximum 
values, thus contributing to new clues for future longevity.

Causes-of-Death Specific Estimates from Synthetic Health Measure: A 
Methodological Framework.

Life expectancy at birth has attracted interest in various fields, as a health 
indicator that measures the quality of life. Its appeal relies on the ability to 
enclose and summarize all the factors affecting longevity. However, more 
granular information, provided by social indicators such as cause-of-death 
mortality rates, plays a crucial role in defining appropriate policies for 
governments to achieve well-being and sustainability goals. Unfortunately, their 
availability is not always guaranteed. Exploiting the relationship between life 
expectancy at birth and cause-of-death mortality rates, in this paper we propose 
an indirect model to produce estimates of death rates due to specific causes 
using the summary indicator of life expectancy at birth, thus the general levels 
of the observed mortality. By leveraging on a constrained optimization 
procedure, we ensure a robust framework where the cause-specific mortality rates 
are coherent to the aggregate mortality. The main advantage is that indirect 
estimations allow us to overcome the data availability problem: very often the 
cause-specific mortality data are incomplete, whereas data on the aggregate 
mortality are not. Using data from the Human Cause-of-Death Database, we show a 
numerical application of our model to two different countries, Russia and Spain, 
which have experienced a different evolution of life expectancy and different 
leading causes of death. In Spain, we detected the impact of several public 
health policies on the lowered levels of cancer deaths and related life 
expectancy increases. As regards the Russia, our results catch the effects of 
the anti-alcohol campaign of 1985-1988 on longevity changes.
