BACKGROUND: The EORTC QLU-C10D is a new multi-attribute utility instrument 
derived from the widely used cancer-specific quality-of-life (QOL) 
questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-C30. The QLU-C10D contains ten dimensions (Physical, 
Role, Social and Emotional Functioning; Pain, Fatigue, Sleep, Appetite, Nausea, 
Bowel Problems), each with four levels. To be used in cost-utility analysis, 
country-specific valuation sets are required.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide Australian utility weights for 
the QLU-C10D.
METHODS: An Australian online panel was quota-sampled to ensure population 
representativeness by sex and age (≥ 18 years). Participants completed a 
discrete choice experiment (DCE) consisting of 16 choice-pairs. Each pair 
comprised two QLU-C10D health states plus life expectancy. Data were analysed 
using conditional logistic regression, parameterised to fit the quality-adjusted 
life-year framework. Utility weights were calculated as the ratio of each QOL 
dimension-level coefficient to the coefficient on life expectancy.
RESULTS: A total of 1979 panel members opted in, 1904 (96%) completed at least 
one choice-pair, and 1846 (93%) completed all 16 choice-pairs. Dimension weights 
were generally monotonic: poorer levels within each dimension were generally 
associated with greater utility decrements. The dimensions that impacted most on 
choice were, in order, Physical Functioning, Pain, Role Functioning and 
Emotional Functioning. Oncology-relevant dimensions with moderate impact were 
Nausea and Bowel Problems. Fatigue, Trouble Sleeping and Appetite had relatively 
small impact. The value of the worst health state was -0.096, somewhat worse 
than death.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first country-specific value set for the 
QLU-C10D, which can facilitate cost-utility analyses when applied to data 
collected with the EORTC QLQ-C30, prospectively and retrospectively.

BACKGROUND: While specific immunotherapy (SIT) has been proven to be 
cost-effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis compared to symptomatic 
treatment, there is a lack of European studies in which sublingual (SLIT) and 
subcutaneous (SCIT) immunotherapy were compared. The present analysis is focused 
on the cost-effectiveness of SCIT compared to SLIT and symptomatic treatment of 
grass pollen allergy in Austria, Spain, and Switzerland. It will address 
specific properties of the underlying healthcare systems.
METHODS: The investigation is based on a previously published health economic 
model calculation. This was designed as a Markov model with pre-defined health 
stages and a duration of 9 years covering specific preparations for SCIT 
(Allergovit) and SLIT (Oralair). The effectiveness was assessed as symptom-score 
based quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Additionally, total cost has been 
determined as well as the cost-effectiveness of SCIT. The robustness of model 
results was proved in further sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: With regard to the effectiveness of both SCIT and SLIT, preparations 
were dominant compared to pharmacological symptomatic therapy. Both strategies 
were associated with additional cost, but, combined with the results on 
effectiveness, both have to be regarded as cost-effective. A direct comparison 
of the SCIT (Allergovit) and SLIT (Oralair) showed lower total costs of SCIT vs 
SLIT for Austria, Spain, and Switzerland (€1,368 vs €2,012, €2,229 vs €2,547, 
and €1,901 vs €2,220) and superior effectiveness (SCIT =8.02 QALYs; SLIT =7.98 
QALYs; and symptomatic therapy =7.90 QALYs).
CONCLUSION: In patients with allergic rhinitis, SIT offers cost-effective 
treatment options compared to symptomatic treatment. When comparing SCIT 
(Allergovit) and SLIT (Oralair), SCIT was dominant in terms of QALYs as well as 
costs, in particular due to a slightly higher patient compliance and lower drug 
costs.

AIMS: This study presents the cost-effectiveness analysis of bariatric surgery 
in Belgium from a third-party payer perspective for a lifetime and 10-year 
horizon.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model incorporating Markov process 
was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass, sleeve 
gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding against conventional medical 
management (CMM). In the model, patients could undergo surgery, or experience 
post-surgery complications, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or die. 
Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. 
The impact of different surgical methods on body mass index (BMI) level in the 
base-case analysis was informed by the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry and 
the Swedish Obese Subject (SOS) study. Healthcare resource use and costs were 
obtained from Belgian sources. A base-case analysis was performed for the 
population, the characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates 
in Belgium.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis over a 10-year time horizon, the increment in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from bariatric surgery vs CMM was 1.4 
per patient, whereas the incremental cost was €3,788, leading to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €2,809 per QALY. Over a lifetime, bariatric 
surgery produced savings of €9,332, an additional 1.1 life years and 5.0 QALYs. 
Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and dominant over 
conventional management over a lifetime horizon.
LIMITATIONS: The model did not include the whole scope of obesity-related 
complications, and also did not account for variation in surgery outcomes for 
different populations of diabetic patients. Also, the data about management of 
patients after surgery was based on assumptions and the opinion of a clinical 
expert.
CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that a current mix of bariatric surgery methods 
was cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and cost-saving over the lifetime of 
the Belgian patient cohort considered in this analysis.

The efficacy of the current HIV therapy has led to increased survival and 
prolongation of the average life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH), as 
well as the emergence of comorbidities and non-AIDS related cancer. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy. 
Current evidence suggests that HCC is an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in HIV infected patients. In fact, HCC prevalence rate is indeed 
higher with respect to the general population average. In this paper, we review 
the diagnostic and therapeutic management of Hepatitis C-related hepatocellular 
carcinoma in HCV-HIV co-infected patients. Several therapeutic options are 
available depending on several factors as HCC stage, liver functions, 
comorbidities and they have been divided into three groups: potentially 
curative, proven effective but not curative, and unproven or ineffective 
therapy. In HIV-infected patients, surgical options are preferred compared to 
non-surgical therapies. Further studies, especially multicenter ones, are needed 
in order to define the most appropriate, evidence-based therapeutic approach to 
PLWH suffering from HCC. It also appears necessary to develop appropriate care 
guidelines for PLWH.

BACKGROUND: A recent Cochrane review compared laparoscopic versus open distal 
pancreatectomy for people with for cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas 
and found that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy may reduce the length of 
hospital stay. We compared the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer.
METHOD: Model based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the UK 
National Health Service. A decision tree model was constructed using 
probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources. A time horizon of 
5 years was used. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken.
RESULTS: The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental net 
monetary benefit was positive (£3,708.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 
-£9,473.62 to £16,115.69) but the 95% CI includes zero, indicating that there is 
significant uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy. The probability laparoscopic 
distal pancreatectomy was cost-effective compared to open distal pancreatectomy 
for pancreatic cancer was between 70% and 80% at the willingness-to-pay 
thresholds generally used in England (£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained). 
Results were sensitive to the survival proportions and the operating time.
CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable uncertainty about whether laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy is cost-effective compared to open distal pancreatectomy for 
pancreatic cancer in the NHS setting.

BACKGROUND: There is mounting evidence that people with severe mental illness 
have unhealthy lifestyles, high rates of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, 
and greater risk of early mortality. This study aimed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of a health promotion intervention seeking to improve 
physical health and reduce substance use in people with psychosis.
METHODS: Participants with a psychotic disorder, aged 18-65 years old and 
registered on an enhanced care approach programme or equivalent were recruited 
from community mental health teams in six mental health trusts in England. 
Participants were randomisation to either standard community mental health team 
care (treatment as usual) or treatment as usual with an integrated health 
promotion intervention (IMPaCT). Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses 
from health and social care and societal perspectives were conducted alongside a 
cluster randomised controlled trial. Total health and social care costs and 
total societal costs at 12 and 15 months were calculated as well as 
cost-effectiveness (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves) at 15 months based on quality of life (SF-36 mental and 
physical health components, primary outcome measures) and quality adjusted life 
years (QALYs) using two measures, EQ-5D-3 L and SF-36. Data were analysed using 
bootstrapped regressions with covariates for relevant baseline variables.
RESULTS: At 12-15 months 301 participants had full data needed to be included in 
the economic evaluation. There were no differences in adjusted health and social 
care costs (£95, 95% CI -£1410 to £1599) or societal costs (£675, 95% CI -£1039 
to £2388) between the intervention and control arms. Similarly, there were no 
differences between the groups in the SF-36 mental component (-0.80, 95% CI 
-3.66 to 2.06), SF-36 physical component (-0.68, 95% CI -3.01 to 1.65), QALYs 
estimated from the SF-36 (-0.00, -0.01 to 0.00) or QALYs estimated from the 
EQ-5D-3 L (0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves 
for all four outcomes and from both cost perspectives indicate that the 
probability of the health promotion intervention being cost-effective does not 
exceed 0.4 for willingness to pay thresholds ranging from £0-£50,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Alongside no evidence of additional quality of life/clinical 
benefit, there is also no evidence of cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a global public health problem and a leading cause 
of disability all over the world. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is 
70-80% and a significant proportion of people affected develop chronic low back 
pain (CLBP). Besides a severe negative impact on people's health and 
health-related quality of life, CLBP is associated with substantial costs for 
society. Medical costs for the management of CLBP and costs for production 
losses due to absenteeism from work are sizeable. Pharmaceuticals, physical 
activity, manipulation, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions are 
examples of widely used treatments for CLBP. However, the scientific basis to 
recommend the use of one treatment over another is limited and more research is 
needed to study the effects, costs and cost-effectiveness of treatments for CLBP 
in clinical practice. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness 
(back pain-related functional limitation, back pain intensity, general health, 
health-related quality of life, and working status), costs (medical costs and 
costs for production losses) and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care and 
physiotherapy when added to information and advice in the treatment of patients 
with non-specific CLBP in Sweden.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, where 
participants are recruited through six primary care rehabilitation units (PCRUs) 
in Stockholm County Council, Sweden. Individuals with non-specific CLBP are 
individually randomised to one of four treatment groups: 'information and 
advice'; 'physiotherapy, and information and advice'; 'chiropractic care, and 
information and advice'; or 'chiropractic care, physiotherapy, and information 
and advice'. A sample size of 600 participants will be recruited during a period 
of 33 months. A computer-based questionnaire is used to collect data on back 
pain-related functional limitation (Oswestry Disability Index), pain intensity 
(Numeric Rating Scale), general health (self-rated health), health-related 
quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), and working status (measured as percentage of 
full-time work). Data will be collected at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months 
after baseline.
DISCUSSION: The results from our study should be considered when producing 
evidence-based guidelines and recommendations on which treatment strategies to 
use for CLBP.

PURPOSE: To assess the optimal age at which a one-time HIV screen should begin 
for adolescents and young adults (AYA) in the U.S. without identified HIV risk 
factors, incorporating clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We simulated HIV-uninfected 12-year-olds in the U.S. without identified 
risk factors who faced age-specific risks of HIV infection (.6-71.3/100,000PY). 
We modeled a one-time screen ($36) at age 15, 18, 21, 25, or 30, each in 
addition to current U.S. screening practices (30% screened by age 24). Outcomes 
included retention in care, virologic suppression, life expectancy, lifetime 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in $/year-of-life saved (YLS) 
from the health-care system perspective. In sensitivity analyses, we varied HIV 
incidence, screening and linkage rates, and costs.
RESULTS: All one-time screens detected a small proportion of lifetime infections 
(.1%-10.3%). Compared with current U.S. screening practices, a screen at age 25 
led to the most favorable care continuum outcomes at age 25: proportion 
diagnosed (77% vs. 51%), linked to care (71% vs. 51%), retained in care (68% vs. 
44%), and virologically suppressed (49% vs. 32%). Compared with the next most 
effective screen, a screen at age 25 provided the greatest clinical benefit, and 
was cost-effective ($96,000/YLS) by U.S. standards (<$100,000/YLS).
CONCLUSIONS: For U.S. AYA without identified risk factors, a one-time routine 
HIV screen at age 25, after the peak of incidence, would optimize clinical 
outcomes and be cost-effective compared with current U.S. screening practices. 
Focusing screening on AYA ages 18 or younger is a less efficient use of a 
one-time screen among AYA than screening at a later age.

OBJECTIVE: Advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) can be treated with 
either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) or primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS). 
Although randomized controlled trials show that NACT is non-inferior in overall 
survival compared to PCS, there may be improvement in short-term morbidity. We 
sought to investigate the cost-effectiveness of NACT relative to PCS for AEOC 
from the US Medicare perspective.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model with a 7-month time 
horizon comparing (1) 3cycles of NACT with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CT), 
followed by interval cytoreductive surgery, then 3 additional cycles of CT, or 
(2) PCS followed by 6cycles of CT. Input parameters included probability of 
chemotherapy complications, surgical complications, treatment completion, 
treatment costs, and utilities. Model outcomes included costs, life-years 
gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in terms of cost per life-year gained and cost 
per QALY gained. We accounted for differences in surgical complexity by 
incorporating the cost of additional procedures and the probability of 
undergoing those procedures. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was 
performed via Monte Carlo simulations.
RESULTS: NACT resulted in a savings of $7034 per patient with a 0.035 QALY 
increase compared to PCS; therefore, NACT dominated PCS in the base case 
analysis. With PSA, NACT was the dominant strategy more than 99% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: In the short-term, NACT is a cost-effective alternative compared to 
PCS in women with AEOC. These results may translate to longer term 
cost-effectiveness; however, data from randomized control trials continues to 
mature.

Biomedical achievements in the last few decades, leading to successful 
therapeutic interventions, have considerably improved human life expectancy. 
Nevertheless, the increasing load and the still suboptimal outcome for patients 
with cardiac dysfunction underlines the relevance of continuous research to 
develop novel therapeutics for these diseases. In this context, the field of 
nanomedicine has attracted a lot of attention due to the potential novel 
treatment possibilities, such as controlled and sustained release, tissue 
targeting, and drug protection from degradation. For cardiac myocytes, which 
constitute the majority of the heart by mass and are the contractile unit, new 
options have been explored in terms of the use of nanomaterials (NMs) for 
therapy, diagnosis, and tissue engineering. This review focuses on the advances 
of nanomedicine targeted to the cardiac myocyte: first presenting the NMs used 
and the principal cardiac myocyte-based afflictions, followed by an overview of 
key advances in the field, including NMs interactions with the cardiac myocyte, 
therapy delivery, diagnosis based on imaging, and tissue engineering for tissue 
repair and heart-on-a-chip devices.

BACKGROUND: Spending on new healthcare technologies increases net population 
health when the benefits of a new technology are greater than their opportunity 
costs-the benefits of the best alternative use of the additional resources 
required to fund a new technology.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of increased government health 
expenditure as an empirical estimate of the average opportunity costs of 
decisions to fund new health technologies. The estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is proposed as a reference ICER to inform 
value-based decision making in Australia.
METHODS: Empirical top-down approaches were used to estimate the QALY effects of 
government health expenditure with respect to reduced mortality and morbidity. 
Instrumental variable two-stage least-squares regression was used to estimate 
the elasticity of mortality-related QALY losses to a marginal change in 
government health expenditure. Regression analysis of longitudinal survey data 
representative of the general population was used to isolate the effects of 
increased government health expenditure on morbidity-related, QALY gains. 
Clinical judgement informed the duration of health-related quality-of-life 
improvement from the annual increase in government health expenditure.
RESULTS: The base-case reference ICER was estimated at AUD28,033 per QALY 
gained. Parametric uncertainty associated with the estimation of mortality- and 
morbidity-related QALYs generated a 95% confidence interval AUD20,758-37,667.
CONCLUSION: Recent public summary documents suggest new technologies with ICERs 
above AUD40,000 per QALY gained are recommended for public funding. The 
empirical reference ICER reported in this article suggests more QALYs could be 
gained if resources were allocated to other forms of health spending.

PURPOSE: People with mental disorders show mortality rates up to 22.2 times 
higher than that of the general population. In spite of progressive increase in 
life expectancy observed in the general population, the mortality gap of people 
suffering from mental health problems has gradually widened. The aim of this 
paper was to study mortality rates in people suffering from mental illness in a 
cohort of people (16,981 subjects) in the local mental health register of the 
province of Modena during the decade 2006-2015.
METHODS: Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated to compare the 
mortality of people with mental disorders to the mortality of people living in 
the province of Modena and the excess of mortality was studied in relation to 
the following variables: gender, age group, diagnosis and causes of death. In 
addition, Poisson regression analysis was performed to study the association 
between patient characteristics and mortality.
RESULTS: An overall excess mortality of 80% was found in subjects under the care 
of mental health services as compared to the reference population (SMR = 1.8, 
95% CI 1.7-1.9). Subjects in the 15-44 year group presented the highest SMR 
(9.2, 95% CI 6.9-11.4). The most prevalent cause of death was cancer (28.1% of 
deaths). At the Poisson regression, the diagnosis "Substance abuse and 
dependence" showed the highest relative risk (RR) (4.00). Moreover, being male, 
single, unemployed and with a lower qualification was associated with higher 
RRs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that subjects with mental illness have higher 
SMR. Noteworthy, the overall higher risk of mortality was observed in the 
younger age group.

BACKGROUND: The number of old people with breast cancer is estimated to increase 
during the next years in developed countries. However, management of breast 
cancer in octogenarians is not well established. The main objective was to 
evaluate if patients older than 80 years with breast cancer are receiving the 
most convenient treatment by using a population registry cancer analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a population cancer registry 
was designed. Data were retrieved from the Castellon Cancer Registry (Valencian 
Community, Spain). Patient records were analyzed from January 1, 1995 to 
December 31, 2013. Two groups were defined: group A, <80 years; and group B, >= 
80 years. Survival analyses were sequentially performed into three phases. 
First, a non-adjusted Kaplan Meier analysis was conducted. For the second 
survival analyses, Cox's proportional hazards model of Overall survival was used 
adjusting for condensed-TNM stage and adjuvant treatments. Finally, the third 
specific adjustment was carried out adding information of life expectancy by age 
for Spanish women, corresponding to year 2008 with condensed-TNM stage and 
Propensity Score variable, as an approximation to relative or disease-specific 
survival.
RESULTS: The total number of included patients was 1304. Women ≥80 years 
presented a more extended disease, larger tumors and less in situ carcinomas. A 
lower proportion of women ≥80 years received adjuvant therapies. In the absence 
of any adjustment of results, the overall survival in women ≥80 years was poorer 
than in younger patients (median of 14.1 years for <80y vs. 5.7 years for ≥80y), 
the crude HR was 4.6 (95% CI: 2.9-7.5) p < 0.001. For second survival analysis, 
the HR was 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8-3.5) p < 0.001. After the third adjustment the HR 
was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.2-2.4) p = 0.004.
CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarians with operable breast cancer are receiving suboptimal 
treatments, which can have repercussions on survival. New studies are required 
to identify a subgroup of women age ≥80 years who may benefit from more 
aggressive treatment and a population of older women on the basis of tumor 
characteristics, comorbidities and life expectancy who may not need as 
aggressive treatment.

RATIONALE: Recent meta-analytic research indicates that social support and 
social integration are highly protective against mortality, and that their 
importance is comparable to, or exceeds, that of many established behavioural 
risks such as smoking, high alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, and obesity 
that are the traditional focus of medical research (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010). 
The present study examines perceptions of the contribution of these various 
factors to life expectancy within the community at large.
METHOD: American and British community respondents (N = 502) completed an 
on-line survey assessing the perceived importance of social and behavioural risk 
factors for mortality.
RESULTS: As hypothesized, while respondents' perceptions of the importance of 
established behavioural risks was positively and highly correlated with their 
actual importance, social factors were seen to be far less important for health 
than they actually are. As a result, overall, there was a small but significant 
negative correlation between the perceived benefits and the actual benefits of 
different social and behavioural factors. Men, younger participants, and 
participants with a lower level of education were more likely to underestimate 
the importance of social factors for health. There was also evidence that 
underestimation was predicted by a cluster of ideological factors, the most 
significant of which was respondents' respect for prevailing convention and 
authorities as captured by Right-Wing Authoritarianism.
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that while people generally underestimate the 
importance of social factors for health this also varies as a function of 
demographic and ideological factors. They point to a range of challenges 
confronting those who seek to promote greater awareness of the importance of 
social factors for health.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether surgical intervention 
with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) or primary arthrodesis (PA) for 
Lisfranc injuries is more cost effective. We conducted a formal 
cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model and decision tree to explore 
the healthcare costs and health outcomes associated with a scenario of ORIF 
versus PA for 45 years postoperatively. The outcomes assessed included long-term 
costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY 
gained. The costs were evaluated from the healthcare system perspective and are 
expressed in U.S. dollars at a 2017 price base. ORIF was always associated with 
greater costs compared with PA and was less effective in the long term. When 
calculating the cost required to gain 1 additional QALY, the PA group cost 
$1429/QALY and the ORIF group cost $3958/QALY. The group undergoing PA overall 
spent, on average, $43,192 less than the ORIF group, and PA was overall a more 
effective technique. Strong dominance compared with ORIF was demonstrated in 
multiple scenarios, and the model's conclusions were unchanged in the 
sensitivity analysis even after varying the key assumptions. ORIF failed to show 
functional or financial benefits. In conclusion, from a healthcare system's 
standpoint, PA would clearly be the preferred treatment strategy for 
predominantly ligamentous Lisfranc injuries and dislocations.

Snake venom is a variable phenotypic trait, whose plasticity and evolution are 
critical for effective antivenom production. A significant reduction of the 
number of snake donations to Butantan Institute (São Paulo, Brazil) occurred in 
recent years, and this fact may impair the production of the Brazilian Bothropic 
Reference Venom (BBRV). Nevertheless, in the last decades a high number of 
Bothrops jararaca specimens have been raised in captivity in the Laboratory of 
Herpetology of Butantan Institute. Considering these facts, we compared the 
biochemical and biological profiles of B. jararaca venom from captive specimens 
and BBRV in order to understand the potential effects of snake captivity upon 
the venom composition. Electrophoretic analysis and proteomic profiling revealed 
few differences in venom protein bands and some differentially abundant toxins. 
Comparison of enzymatic activities showed minor differences between the two 
venoms. Similar cross-reactivity recognition pattern of both venoms by the 
antibothropic antivenom produced by Butantan Institute was observed. Lethality 
and neutralization of lethality for B. jararaca venom from captive specimens and 
BBRV showed similar values. Considering these results we suggest that the 
inclusion of B. jararaca venom from captive specimens in the composition of BBRV 
would not interfere with the quality of this reference venom.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Snakebite envenomation is a neglected tropical 
pathology whose treatment is based on the use of specific antivenoms. Bothrops 
jararaca is responsible for the majority of snakebites in South and Southeastern 
Brazil. Its venom shows individual, sexual, and ontogenetic variability, 
however, the effect of animal captivity upon venom composition is unknown. 
Considering the reduced number of wild-caught snakes donated to Butantan 
Institute in the last decades, and the increased life expectancy of the snakes 
raised in captivity in the Laboratory of Herpetology, this work focused on the 
comparative profiling of B. jararaca venom from captive snakes and the Brazilian 
Bothropic Reference Venom (BBRV). BBRV is composed of venom obtained upon the 
first milking of wild-caught B. jararaca specimens, and used to assess the 
potency of all bothropic antivenoms produced by Brazilian suppliers. The use of 
proteomic strategies, added to biochemical and neutralization tests, allowed to 
conclude that, despite some subtle differences detected between these two 
venoms, venom from captive specimens could be used in the BBRV composition 
without affecting its quality in antivenom potency assays.

PURPOSE: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant intravaginal 
brachytherapy (IVBT) vs. observation after total hysterectomy and bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy (TH/BSO) for high-intermediate risk (HIR) endometrial 
carcinoma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of IVBT by comparing average cumulative costs, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between patients 
allocated to (1) 'observation' or (2) 'IVBT' after TH/BSO. We used a prototype 
Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma (PORTEC)-defined HIR 
patient in the base case analysis. We calibrated the model to match the outcomes 
reported in the PORTEC-1 and PORTEC-2 trials. Utilities were obtained from 
published estimates, and costs were calculated based on Medicare reimbursement 
($5445 for IVBT). The societal willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000 
per QALY. The time horizon was 5 years.
RESULTS: IVBT was associated with a net increase of 0.094 QALYs (4.512 vs. 
4.418) as well as an increase in mean cost ($17,453 vs. $15,620) relative to 
observation. The ICER for IVBT was $19,500 per QALY. On one-way sensitivity 
analysis, IVBT remained cost-effective when its cost was less than $12,937. If 
the probability of vaginal recurrence in the observation arm was increased or 
decreased by 25%, the ICER became $1335 per QALY and $87,925 per QALY, 
respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that IVBT was the 
preferred management option in 86% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: IVBT is cost-effective compared with observation after TH/BSO for 
HIR endometrial carcinoma by commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.
