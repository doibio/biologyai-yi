Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract 
infection (LRTI) and hospitalization in infants and children globally. Many 
observational studies have found an association between RSV LRTI in early life 
and subsequent respiratory morbidity, including recurrent wheeze of early 
childhood (RWEC) and asthma. Conversely, two randomized placebo-controlled 
trials of efficacious anti-RSV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in heterogenous 
infant populations found no difference in physician-diagnosed RWEC or asthma by 
treatment group. If a causal association exists and RSV vaccines and mAbs can 
prevent a substantial fraction of RWEC/asthma, the full public health value of 
these interventions would markedly increase. The primary alternative 
interpretation of the observational data is that RSV LRTI in early life is a 
marker of an underlying predisposition for the development of RWEC and asthma. 
If this is the case, RSV vaccines and mAbs would not necessarily be expected to 
impact these outcomes. To evaluate whether the available evidence supports a 
causal association between RSV LRTI and RWEC/asthma and to provide guidance for 
future studies, the World Health Organization convened a meeting of subject 
matter experts on February 12-13, 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland. After discussing 
relevant background information and reviewing the current epidemiologic 
evidence, the group determined that: (i) the evidence is inconclusive in 
establishing a causal association between RSV LRTI and RWEC/asthma, (ii) the 
evidence does not establish that RSV mAbs (and, by extension, future vaccines) 
will have a substantial effect on these outcomes and (iii) regardless of the 
association with long-term childhood respiratory morbidity, severe acute RSV 
disease in young children poses a substantial public health burden and should 
continue to be the primary consideration for policy-setting bodies deliberating 
on RSV vaccine and mAb recommendations. Nonetheless, the group recognized the 
public health importance of resolving this question and suggested good practice 
guidelines for future studies.

BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma was considered as a dismal disease with very poor 
prognosis until recently. Cholangiocarcinoma is increasingly found due to 
increased life expectancy. Although surgical and medical management were 
advanced recently, data on the prognosis, especially extrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), were limited. This study aimed to identify 
clinicopathologic features and prognosis of patients with ECC.
METHODS: Patients followed up and diagnosed with ECC between January 2014 and 
December 2016 at a tertiary hospital were included, whereas those with 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, and ampullary cancer were 
excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were followed after the treatment (49 men and 34 
women; median age 73.3 years). Cancer location was classified as distal common 
bile duct (25 patients), proximal common bile duct (24 patients), common hepatic 
duct (20 patients), and hilar (14 patients). About 14.5% of patients had history 
of another malignant neoplasm, and 24.1% patients had chronic illness. Surgical 
resection was performed in 54 patients (65%) and dysplasia was combined in 63% 
(34/54). Adjuvant chemotherapy was performed in 54% (29/54), but only 7 
underwent palliative chemotherapy in 29 nonsurgical patients. The median overall 
survival in all patients was 30.9 months. In analyzing the treatment modality, 
median survival of adjuvant chemotherapy, surgery only, palliative chemotherapy, 
and supportive care groups were 42.9, 30.9, 12.0, and 8.9 months, respectively 
(P < 0.05). In the Cox regression analysis of survival, age, surgical resection, 
chemotherapy, and comorbidity were significant prognostic factors, and the 
comorbidity was the only significant prognostic factor in the multivariable 
analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.80; 95% CI: 1.32-5.95; P = 0.007). In a subgroup 
analysis of surgical patients, the presence of dysplasia was a favorable 
prognostic factor in the multivariable analysis (HR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.91; 
P = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival of patients with ECC was quite high and 
increased with chemotherapy. Absence of comorbidity, and presence of dysplasia 
were good prognostic factors.

The ability of the nervous system to sense cellular stress and coordinate 
protein homeostasis is essential for organismal health. Unfortunately, stress 
responses that mitigate disturbances in proteostasis, such as the unfolded 
protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER), become defunct with age. 
In this work, we expressed the constitutively active UPRER transcription factor, 
XBP-1s, in a subset of astrocyte-like glia, which extended the life span in 
Caenorhabditis elegans Glial XBP-1s initiated a robust cell nonautonomous 
activation of the UPRER in distal cells and rendered animals more resistant to 
protein aggregation and chronic ER stress. Mutants deficient in neuropeptide 
processing and secretion suppressed glial cell nonautonomous induction of the 
UPRER and life-span extension. Thus, astrocyte-like glial cells play a role in 
regulating organismal ER stress resistance and longevity.

Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for the worst prognosis of all 
types of breast cancers due to a high risk of recurrence and a lack of targeted 
therapeutic options. Extensive effort is required to identify novel targets for 
TNBC. In the present study, a robust rank aggregation (RRA) analysis based on 
genome‑wide gene expression datasets involving TNBC patients from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was performed to identify key genes associated 
with TNBC. A total of 194 highly ranked differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were identified in TNBC vs. non‑TNBC. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis was utilized to explore 
the biological functions of the identified genes. These DEGs were mainly 
involved in the biological processes termed positive regulation of transcription 
from RNA polymerase II promoter, negative regulation of apoptotic process, 
response to drug, response to estradiol and negative regulation of cell growth. 
Genes were mainly involved in the KEGG pathway termed estrogen signaling 
pathway. The aberrant expression of several randomly selected DEGs were further 
validated in cell lines, clinical tissues and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
cohort. Furthermore, all the top‑ranked DEGs underwent survival analysis using 
TCGA database, of which overexpression of 4 genes (FABP7, ART3, CT83, and TTYH1) 
were positively correlated to the life expectancy (P<0.05) of TNBC patients. In 
addition, a model consisting of two genes (FABP7 and CT83) was identified to be 
significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of TNBC patients by 
means of Cox regression, Kaplan‑Meier, and receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) analyses. In conclusion, the present study identified a number of key 
genes as potential biomarkers involved in TNBC, which provide novel insights 
into the tumorigenesis of TNBC at the gene level and may serve as independent 
prognostic factors for TNBC prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Localized renal cell carcinoma is increasingly relevant in daily 
urological practice due to earlier diagnosis and higher life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze and compare current treatment evidence for localized 
renal cell carcinoma regarding new aspects of nephron-sparing surgery, the 
different surgical approaches and focal therapy.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed to identify relevant publications 
from 2018 and 2019.
RESULTS: Prospective randomized trials comparing nephrectomy with partial 
nephrectomy, the three different surgical approaches with each other, and focal 
therapy with surgery are still lacking. Positive effects on survival by partial 
nephrectomy could be demonstrated, even though partial nephrectomy has a higher 
morbidity than radical nephrectomy. Older patients (>75 years) with advanced 
localized renal cell carcinoma did not appear to benefit from partial 
nephrectomy so far, but minimally invasive surgical approaches are 
underrepresented in such studies. Minimally invasive partial nephrectomy is 
superior to the open approach, and robot-assisted partial nephrectomy has better 
results than laparoscopy. Focal therapy of kidney tumors is technically safe and 
feasible, but relevant comparisons with partial nephrectomy are still lacking.
CONCLUSIONS: Partial nephrectomy is still the gold standard treatment for 
localized renal cell carcinoma, it should be preferably performed by 
a robot-assisted approach. Focal therapy can serve as an alternative in highly 
selected cases.

Control of Actin and Calcium for Chitin Synthase Delivery to the Hyphal Tip of 
Aspergillus.

Filamentous fungi are covered by a cell wall consisting mainly of chitin and 
glucan. The synthesis of chitin, a β-1,4-linked homopolymer of 
N-acetylglucosamine, is essential for hyphal morphogenesis. Fungal chitin 
synthases are integral membrane proteins that have been classified into seven 
classes. ChsB, a class III chitin synthase, is known to play a key role in 
hyphal tip growth and has been used here as a model to understand the cell 
biology of cell wall biosynthesis in Aspergillus nidulans. Chitin synthases are 
transported on secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane for new cell wall 
synthesis. Super-resolution localization imaging as a powerful biophysical 
approach indicated dynamics of the Spitzenkörper where spatiotemporally 
regulated exocytosis and cell extension, whereas high-speed pulse-chase imaging 
has revealed ChsB transport mechanism mediated by kinesin-1 and myosin-5. In 
addition, live imaging analysis showed correlations among intracellular Ca2+ 
levels, actin assembly, and exocytosis in growing hyphal tips. This suggests 
that pulsed Ca2+ influxes coordinate the temporal control of actin assembly and 
exocytosis, which results in stepwise cell extension. It is getting clear that 
turgor pressure and cell wall pressure are involved in the activation of Ca2+ 
channels for Ca2+ oscillation and cell extension. Here the cell wall synthesis 
and tip growth meet again.

Hypertensive Mediated Organ Damage and Hypertension Management. How to Assess 
Beneficial Effects of Antihypertensive Treatments?

Rosario, Argentina. danielpiskorz@ciudad.com.ar.

The presence of hypertensive mediated organ damage is related to increased 
vascular risk and mortality and its prevention should be a therapeutic target 
and a surrogate marker of in/adequate blood pressure control. In old adult 
hypertensive patients the therapeutic target should be to prevent major 
cardiovascular events, but in young hypertensive subjects the focus should be 
pointed on preventing the development of hypertensive mediated organ damage, 
since most of the hard events are preceded by functional and structural tissues 
injury. Hypertension Guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and 
European Society of Hypertension recognizes that some variables like 
electrocardiographic or echocardiographic left ventricle hypertrophy, chronic 
kidney disease or advance retinopathy, all considered as hypertensive mediated 
organ damage, may be modifiers of cardiovascular risk estimated by the SCORE 
system, and for that reason they should be screened in hypertensive patients. It 
is well known the problem of limited health systems financial resources in many 
low and even median income countries which precludes the possibilities of 
generalizing the search for hypertension mediated organ damage in all 
hypertensive patients. In these scenario the recommendation to perform a 
detailed screening should be critically evaluated. Some questions remained 
unanswered: the screening generalization of hypertensive mediated organ damage 
should modify the cardiovascular risk score of the patients, if its presence 
could modify the therapeutic approach, and as a consequence, if the treatment 
adjustment should prolong life expectancy and ameliorate the quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Hip fracture leads to an increase in mortality and deterioration in 
the quality of life. The increase in life expectancy results in an increase in 
the number of oldest old patients.
AIMS: To analyze the characteristics of centenarian hip fracture patients and 
compare them with younger hip fracture patients.
METHODS: Retrospective study, including 176 patients (48 centenarians, 65 
nonagenarians and 63 octogenarians) undergoing surgery after hip from 2009 to 
2018 and followed for 1-year survival. Qualitative variables were compared by 
Chi-square test and quantitative variables, by Kruskal-Wallis test. Survival 
analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier test and statistical differences were 
assessed by log-rank test. p value < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: Centenarians showed the lowest Charlson index (p = 0.001), cognitive 
impairment (p < 0.001), and daily drug intake (p = 0.034). The in-hospital, 
30-day and 1-year mortality rates did not show statistical significant 
differences. The 1-year survival analysis showed that patients died in order of 
age (p = 0.045). No differences were found regarding readmissions.
DISCUSSION: Hip fracture incidence in centenarians is increasing. Our study 
states the lowest complexity for centenarians. Hip fracture mortality rates have 
been linked to patients' age. In-hospital mortality rate has been reduced, and 
for the 30-day and 1-year mortality rates, we noted that mortality follows a 
pattern clearly related to age.
CONCLUSIONS: Centenarians showed the lowest comorbidity and complexity. 
Readmissions before 1 year, mortality rates at discharge, 30-day and 1-year 
follow-up were not significantly different, but 1-year survival analysis showed 
that patients are dying as they are ageing.

BACKGROUND: Most agricultural crops contain high moisture content (80-95% wet 
basis (wb)) which makes them very susceptible to microbial damage leading to 
shorter shelf-life and high postharvest losses. The high perishability of these 
agricultural products requires preservation techniques to prolong their 
shelf-lives. Drying remains an important component of processing in this regard. 
Therefore, any pretreatment methods for drying agricultural product that 
decreases the moisture content and minimizes drying time by conserving the 
quality of the crop product is of prime significance. This article is a 
comprehensive review of recent developments of non-thermal pretreatment (NTP) 
methods. A summary of their significance, emerging and innovative methods of 
this technology together with its applications and limitations are discussed. 
This article further examines the environmental impact of NTP techniques.
RESULTS: NTP techniques, such as high pressure, ultrasound, pulsed electric 
field and osmotic dehydration methods are essential operations for 
pre-dehydration of agricultural products prior to drying. These techniques can 
avoid the deleterious effects of heat on nutritive value, colour and flavour of 
agricultural products compared to thermal pretreatments. They also enhance the 
inactivation of the enzymes, improve energy efficiency and mass transfer, reduce 
processing time, preserve bioactive compounds, improve drying kinetics and 
drying rate, minimize enzymatic browning, and enhance product quality.
CONCLUSION: These findings will provide a better understanding of different NTP 
methods and also make available more information for selecting pretreatment 
techniques for drying of agricultural products. © 2020 Society of Chemical

Postharvest technologies, such as the application of coatings, could contribute 
to the extension of the shelf life of avocado fruit. The objective of the 
present research was to evaluate the effects of coating, based on 
agro-industrial co-products (citrus pectin, broken rice grain flour, and 
cellulosic rice skin nanofiber), sorbitol and potassium sorbate, on the quality 
of avocado (cultivar 'Quintal') stored under refrigeration. The coating 
contributed to a longer conservation of the green color of avocado, both peel 
and pulp, and significantly reducing the respiration rate of the coated fruit, 
which was 35% lower than that of the control fruit. The coated fruit was firmer 
and, possibly, the addition of cellulosic nanofiber contributed to the 
maintenance of this firmness. Regarding the bioactive compounds, there was no 
difference (p > 0.05) among the coated and control fruit. During refrigerated 
storage, total phenolic compounds content increased (p < 0.05) from 
311.44 ± 25.89 to 800.25 ± 160.74 mg kg-1 gallic acid equivalents (GAE) in the 
control fruit, and from 242.86 ± 52.33 to 584.75 ± 125.57 mg kg-1 GAE in the 
coated fruit. It was concluded that the shelf life of avocado (cultivar 
'Quintal') could be extended and ripening delayed by a minimum of 8 days, by 
applying a coating formulated with rice flour, pectin, sorbitol, potassium 
sorbate, and cellulosic rice skin nanofiber.

Psychiatry and the Opioid Overdose Crisis.

For the third year in a row, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
reported an unprecedented decline in life expectancy for the United States, a 
decline attributable mainly to drug overdose deaths and suicides. Drug overdoses 
have continued to rise and are now estimated to account for 70,237 deaths in 
2017. The root causes of the modern opioid crisis are complex and traceable to 
at least 30 factors. A prime driver has been the health care system. Pressure on 
medical practitioners to resort to opioids for managing chronic pain led to a 
nation awash with prescription opioids. In 2017, an unprecedented action was 
taken by President Donald J. Trump as he signed an executive order establishing 
the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, 
tasked with producing guidance on reversing the crisis. The 56 recommendations 
of the President's Commission report were grounded in advanced strategies for 
prevention, treatment, rescue, recovery support, research, improved data 
analytics, and accountability. With a focus on the quality of treatment services 
and recovery homes, the report calls for implementing high standards of care for 
treatment. Specialists in addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry are best 
positioned to develop and implement high-quality care.

Surgical intensive care - current and future challenges?

Rohrig SAH(1), Lance MD(1), Faisal Malmstrom M(1).

Corporation, Doha, Qatar.

Bjorn Ibsen, an anesthetist who pioneered positive pressure ventilation as a 
treatment option during the Copenhagen polio epidemic of 1952, set up the first 
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Europe in 1953. He managed polio patients on 
positive pressure ventilation together with physicians and physiologists in a 
dedicated ward, where one nurse was assigned to each patient. In that sense 
Ibsen is more or less the father of intensive care medicine as a specialty and 
also an advocate of the one-to-one nursing ratio for critically ill patients. 
Nowadays, the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) offers critical care treatment 
to unstable, severely, or potentially severely ill patients in the perioperative 
setting, who have life-threatening conditions and require comprehensive care, 
constant monitoring, and possible emergency interventions. Hence there is one 
very specific challenge in the surgical setting: the intensivist has to manage 
the patient flow starting from admission to the hospital through to the 
operating theater, in the SICU, and postoperatively for the discharge to the 
ward. In other words, the planning of the resources (most frequently 
availability of beds) has to be optimized to prevent cancellations of elective 
surgical procedures but also to facilitate other emergency admissions. SICU 
intensivists take the role of arbitrators between surgical demand and patient's 
interests. This means they supervise the safety, efficacy, and workability of 
the process with respect to all stakeholders. This notion was reported in 2007 
when Stawicki and co-workers performed a small prospective study concluding that 
it appears safe if the dedicated intensivist takes over the role of the last 
arbitrator supported by a multidisciplinary team.1 However, demographic changes 
in many countries during the last few decades have given rise to populations 
which are more elderly and sicker than before. This impacts on the healthcare 
system in general but on the intensivist and the ICU team too. In addition, in a 
society with an increased life expectancy, the balance between treatable 
disease, outcome, and utilization of resources must be maintained. This fact 
gains even more importance as patients and their families claim "high end" 
treatment. Such a demand is reflected looking at the developments that have 
taken place over the last 25 years. Mainly, the focus of intensive care medicine 
was on technical support or even replacement of failing organ systems such as 
the lungs, the heart, or the kidneys by veno-venous extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (VV-ECMO), veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO), and continuous veno-venous 
hemofiltration (CVVH) respectively. This means "technical care" became a core 
capability and expectation of critical care medicine. In parallel, medical 
treatment became more standardized. For example, lung protective ventilation 
strategies, early enteral feeding, and daily sedation vacation are part of 
modern protocols. As a consequence, ventilator time has been reduced and 
patients therefore develop delirium less frequently. These measures, beside 
others, are implemented in care bundles to improve the quality of care of 
patients by the whole ICU team. The importance of specialty trained teams was 
already pointed out 35 years ago when Li et al.,2 demonstrated in a study 
performed in a community hospital that the mortality was decreased if an ICU was 
managed 24/7 by an on-site physician. The association of improved outcomes and 
presence of a critical care trained physician (intensivist) has been shown in 
several studies since that time.3,4,5,6 A modern multidisciplinary critical care 
team consists at least of an intensivist, ICU nurse, pharmacist, respiratory 
therapist, physiotherapist, and the primary team physician. Based on clinical 
needs, the team can be supplemented by oncologists, cardiologists, or other 
specialties. Again, this approach is supported by research: a recent 
retrospective cohort study from the California Hospital Assessment and Reporting 
Taskforce (CHART) on 60,330 patients confirmed the association between improved 
patient outcome and such a multidisciplinary team.7 If such an intensive care 
team makes a difference, why do not all patients at risk receive advanced 
ICU-care? It was already demonstrated by Esteban et al., in a prospective study 
that patients with severe sepsis had a mortality rate of 26% when not admitted 
to an ICU in comparison to 11% when they were admitted to an ICU.8 Meanwhile, we 
know that early referral is particularly important, because for ischemic 
diseases the timing appears to make a difference in terms of full recovery. So, 
the following questions arise: Should intensive care be rolled out to each ward 
and physical admission to an ICU or be restricted to special cases only? For 
this purpose, the so-called "Rapid Response Teams" (RRT) or "Medical Emergency 
Team" (MET), which essentially are a form of an ICU outreach team, were 
implemented. The name, composition, or exact role of such team varies from 
institution to institution and country to country. Alternatively, should all 
ward staff be educated to recognize sick patients earlier for a timely transfer 
to a dedicated area? This would mean that ICU-care would be introduced in the 
ward. A first attempt to answer this question, whether to deploy critical care 
resources to deteriorating patients outside the ICU 24/7, was given by Churpek 
et al.9 The success of the rapid response teams could be related to decreased 
rates of cardiac arrest outside the ICU setting and in-hospital mortality. 
Interestingly, an analysis of the registry database of the RRT calls in this 
study showed that the lowest frequency of calls occurred between 1:00 AM to 6:59 
AM time period. In contrast, the mortality was highest around 7 AM and lowest 
during noon hour. This indicates that not simply the availability of such a team 
makes a difference but also the alertness of the ward-teams is of high 
importance to identify deteriorating patients in a timely manner. Essentially, 
this would necessitate ward staff being trained to provide a higher level of 
care enabling them to better recognize when patients become sicker to avoid a 
delayed call to the ICU. Alternatively, a system in which the intensivist plays 
a major role in daily ward rounds could be beneficial. So, the ward doctor 
should become an intensivist. However, the latter means the ICU is rolled out 
across the whole hospital which would consume a huge amount of resources. 
Another option would be 24/7 remote monitoring of patients at risk that notifies 
the intensivist or RRT in case of need. The infrastructure, technology, and 
manpower to put this in place also has associated costs. As the demand for ICU 
care will rise further in the future, intensivists will play an even more 
important role in the healthcare system that itself is under enormous economic 
pressure to ensure the best quality of care for critically ill patients. Besides 
excellent knowledge and hard skills, intensivists need to be team players, 
communicators, facilitators, and arbitrators to achieve the best results in 
collaboration with all involved in patient treatment.

Building Specialized Palliative Care for the Czech Republic: A Fifteen-Year 
Leadership Journey in a Developing Country.

Since its creation, the Czech Republic has developed an advanced health system 
and social system. Life expectancy at birth has increased by an average of 7 
years in only 20 years. However, polymorbidity and multicausality have now 
become topics of concern. In some ways they are products of our success. Yet, 
the health system and social system were not designed for these patients nor are 
health care professionals trained and willing to assess and address clinical 
needs of fragile, chronically ill, and incurable patients. This is true in much 
of the developing world where initial improvements have led to this new 
population-based challenge. In that sense, the Czech Republic is an example of 
what needs to happen in developing countries. Inpatient hospice care, which has 
been developing in the Czech Republic since 1993, is not the answer to this 
problem. Rather, approaches to ensure that the early introduction of palliative 
care in the course of serious illness care, personalized medicine, and a 
multidisciplinary approach in the system is required. Focusing only on terminal 
illness care is insufficient. Beginning in 2005-2006, we have worked to create a 
system of education and clinical services in specialized palliative care in the 
health and social system. This article seeks to describe the leadership steps of 
this systemic change in the Czech Republic with the objective of helping others 
make the same journey.

BACKGROUND: Subnational regional mortality inequalities are large and appear to 
be mostly increasing within industrialized countries, although comparative 
studies across high-income countries are scarce. Germany is an important country 
to examine because it continues to experience considerable economic disparities 
between its federal states, in part resulting from its former division.
METHODS: We analyse state-level mortality in Germany utilizing data from a newly 
constructed regional database based on the methodology of the Human Mortality 
Database. We compare time trends (1991-2015) in the German state-level standard 
deviation in life expectancy to that of other large, wealthy countries and 
examine the association between mortality and economic inequalities at the 
regional level. Finally, using contour-decomposition methods, we investigate the 
degree to which age patterns of mortality are converging across German federal 
states.
RESULTS: Regional inequalities in life expectancy in Germany are comparatively 
low internationally, particularly among women, despite high state-level 
inequalities in economic conditions. These low regional mortality inequalities 
emerged 5-10 years after reunification. Mortality is converging over most ages 
between the longest- and shortest-living German state populations and across the 
former East-West political border, with the exception of an emerging East-West 
divergence in mortality among working-aged men.
CONCLUSIONS: The German example shows that large regional economic inequalities 
are not necessarily paralleled with large regional mortality disparities. Future 
research should investigate the factors that fostered the emergence of this 
unusual pattern in Germany.

INTRODUCTION: We sought to assess and compare safety and efficacy of 
fesoterodine and oxybutynin extended-release in the treatment of pediatric 
overactive bladder (OAB).
METHODS: We conducted a non-inferiority, randomized, double-blind, crossover 
trial comparing fesoterodine 4-8 mg and oxybutynin 10-20 mg once daily (QD) in 
children with OAB aged 5-14 years (2015-2018). Every child received the first 
medication for eight weeks, followed by crossover to the second antimuscarinic 
after a three-days washout. Dose up-titration was possible at mid-course. 
Patients could enter a fesoterodine 12-month extension. Endpoints were assessed 
through changes on voiding diaries, Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition 
score (PPBC), adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, post-void 
residual, urinalysis, and blood tests. The Wilcoxon rank sum and Wilcoxon signed 
rank tests were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were randomized (two early dropouts). Expected 
class effects (dry mouth/constipation) were present but no significant 
difference was observed. There was a 10.1 beats/minute increase in heart rate 
with fesoterodine (p<0.01) (oxybutynin-1.9 beats/min; p=non-significant [ns]). 
No life-threatening or serious adverse events occurred. Efficacy was similar for 
both drugs. Bladder capacity improved over the 16 months of the study; baseline 
capacity of 125 mL (44.5% expected bladder capacity for age [%EBC]) to 171 mL 
(53.9 %EBC) at the end of the extension phase. No clinical or statistical 
difference was shown between efficacy measures for fesoterodine or oxybutynin.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of fesoterodine or oxybutynin appear safe and effective for 
the treatment of OAB in children. Based on our study, long-term treatment to 
achieve the ultimate goal of urinary continence is needed in this population.

University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
postoperative feeding guidelines to reduce complications in infants with 
intestinal surgery compared to standard feeding practices.
METHODS: Using outcomes from a cohort study, Markov models from health care and 
societal perspectives simulated costs per hospitalization among infants fed via 
guidelines versus standard practice. Short-term outcomes included intestinal 
failure-associated liver disease, necrotizing enterocolitis after feeding, 
sepsis, and mortality. Effectiveness was measured as length of stay. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) compared cost over length of stay. 
Univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses with 10,000 Monte 
Carlo Simulations were performed. A second decision tree model captured the cost 
per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using utilities associated with 
long-term outcomes (liver cirrhosis and transplantation).
RESULTS: In the hospital perspective, standard feeding had a cost of $31,258,902 
and 8296 hospital days, and the feeding guidelines had a cost of $29,295,553 and 
8096 hospital days. The ICER was $-9832 per hospital stay with guideline use. 
More than 90% of the ICERs were in the dominant quadrant. Results were similar 
for the societal perspective. Long-term costs and utilities in the guideline 
group were $2830 and 0.91, respectively, versus $4030 and 0.90, resulting in an 
ICER of $-91,756/QALY.
CONCLUSION: In our models, feeding guideline use resulted in cost savings and 
reduction in hospital stay in the short-term and cost savings and an increase in 
QALYs in the long-term. Using a systematic approach to feed surgical infants 
appears to reduce costly complications, but further data from a larger cohort 
are needed.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the real-world cost-effectiveness of 
rivaroxaban, versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), for stroke prevention in 
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) from a French national health insurance 
perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed with a lifetime horizon and cycle length 
of 3 months. All inputs were drawn from real-world evidence (RWE) studies: data 
on baseline patient characteristics at model entry were obtained from a French 
RWE study, clinical event rates as well as persistence rates for the VKA 
treatment arm were estimated from a variety of RWE studies, and a meta-analysis 
provided comparative effectiveness for rivaroxaban compared to VKA. Model 
outcomes included costs (drug costs, clinical event costs, and VKA monitoring 
costs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and life-years (LY) gained, 
incremental cost per QALY, and incremental cost per LY. Sensitivity analyses 
were performed to test the robustness of the model and to better understand the 
results drivers.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the incremental total cost was €714 and the 
total incremental QALYs and LYs were 0.12 and 0.16, respectively. The resulting 
incremental cost/QALY and incremental cost/LY were €6,006 and €4,586, 
respectively. The results were more sensitive to the inclusion of 
treatment-specific utility decrements and clinical event rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no official willingness-to-pay threshold in 
France, these results suggest that rivaroxaban is likely to be cost-effective 
compared to VKA in French patients with AF from a national insurance 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: The double burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) 
has attracted increasing attention, because DM not only increases the risk of 
active TB but also affects treatment outcomes. Screening for TB among diabetic 
patients has been recommended, but requires real-world evidence by considering 
its cost-effectiveness, cost-utility ratio, and cost-benefit ratio.
METHODS: A screening program was conducted in Jiangyin City of Jiangsu Province, 
China. A total of 14 869 diabetic patients received regular physical 
examinations for three consecutive years and were followed for the diagnosis of 
TB. The cost of screening and the effectiveness, utility, and social benefits 
attributed to the program were evaluated. In addition, a matched case-control 
study was conducted and the nomogram was used to identify high-risk groups that 
could be the target population for screening.
RESULTS: Among the 14 869 diabetic patients who participated in this screening 
program, 22 were diagnosed with TB, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 83 910 CNY per disability-adjusted life-year 
(DALY) gained and a cost-benefit ratio of 0.50. If the screening program was 
limited to high-risk diabetic patients by considering body mass index (BMI), 
fasting blood glucose (FBG), and triglycerides, the ICER decreased to 34 303 CNY 
per DALY gained and the cost-benefit ratio increased to 1.22.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for TB using regular chest X-ray examinations is feasible 
but not economical in areas with a low incidence of TB. It is recommended that 
diabetic patients with a low BMI, high FBG, and low triglycerides are selected 
as subjects for TB screening.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of intensive blood pressure (BP) 
treatment in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) over their 
lifetime in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed for the BP strategies to estimate the 
added lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. These 2 
items were then used to develop an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Event rates were estimated from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 
and the other model inputs were retrieved from previous studies. Estimated costs 
were collected from 5 private hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The model used 
a lifetime framework adopting healthcare payer in Saudi Arabia. Sensitivity 
analysis was conducted using 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to 
evaluate the robustness and uncertainty of the estimates.
RESULTS: Over a 30-year period, intensive BP therapy would be cost-effective 
compared with the standard treatment with incremental costs per QALY, in US
