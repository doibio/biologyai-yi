Objectives: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and a major 
marker of ischemic stroke risk. Early detection is crucial and, once diagnosed, 
anticoagulation therapy can be initiated to reduce stroke risk. The aim of this 
study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of employing an insertable cardiac 
monitor (ICM), BIOMONITOR, for the detection of AF compared to standard of care 
(SoC) ECG and Holter monitoring in patients with cryptogenic stroke, that is, 
stroke of unknown origin and where paroxysmal, silent AF is suspected. Materials 
and methods: A Markov model was developed which consisted of five main health 
states reflecting the potential lifetime evolution of the AF disease: post 
cryptogenic stroke (index event), subsequent mild, moderate and severe stroke, 
and death. Sub-states were included to track a patient's AF diagnostic status 
and the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. AF detection was assumed 
to result in a treatment switch from aspirin to anticoagulants, except among 
those with a history of major bleeding. Detection yield and accuracy, clinical 
actions and treatment effects were derived from the literature and validated by 
an expert clinician. All relevant costs from a US Medicare perspective were 
included. Results and conclusions: An ICM-based strategy was associated with a 
reduction of 37 secondary ischemic strokes per 1000 patients monitored compared 
with SoC. Total per-patient costs with an ICM were higher (US$90,052 vs. 
US$85,157) although stroke-related costs were reduced. The use of an ICM was 
associated with a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$18,487 
per life year gained compared with SoC and US$25,098 per quality-adjusted life 
year gained, below established willingness-to-pay thresholds. The conclusions 
were found to be robust over a range of input values. From a US Medicare 
perspective the use of a BIOMONITOR ICM represents a cost-effective diagnostic 
strategy for patients with cryptogenic stroke and suspected AF.

BACKGROUND: Between 8 May 2018 and 27 May 2019, cumulatively there were 1286 
deaths from Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). 
The objective of this study was to estimate the monetary value of human lives 
lost through EVD in DRC.
METHODS: Human capital approach was applied to monetarily value years of life 
lost due to premature deaths from EVD. The future losses were discounted to 
their present values at 3% discount rate. The model was reanalysed using 5 and 
10% discount rates. The analysis was done alternately using the average life 
expectancies for DRC, the world, and the Japanese females to assess the effect 
on the monetary value of years of life lost (MVYLL).
RESULTS: The 1286 deaths resulted in a total MVYLL of Int$17,761,539 assuming 3% 
discount rate and DRC life expectancy of 60.5 years. The average monetary value 
per EVD death was of Int$13,801. About 44.7 and 48.6% of the total MVYLL was 
borne by children aged below 9 years and adults aged between 15 years and 
59 years, respectively. Re-estimation of the algorithm with average life 
expectancies of the world (both sexes) and Japanese females, holding discount 
rate constant at 3%, increased the MVYLL by Int$ 3,667,085 (20.6%) and Int$ 
7,508,498 (42.3%), respectively. The application of discount rates of 5 and 10%, 
holding life expectancy constant at 60.5 years, reduced the MVYLL by Int$ 
4,252,785 (- 23.9%) and Int$ 9,658,195 (- 54.4%) respectively.
CONCLUSION: The EVD outbreak in DRC led to a considerable MVYLL. There is an 
urgent need for DRC government and development partners to disburse adequate 
resources to strengthen the national health system and other systems that 
address social determinants of health to end recurrence of EVD outbreaks.

Advances in the immunotherapy of cancer have prolonged survival for cancer 
patients, but the clinical and financial impact of treatments must be considered 
in determining the overall clinical utility and economic value of therapeutic 
agents. Quality-adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
are clinical and economic metrics that can be used to evaluate the value of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. This Commentary provides perspective on the 
limitations, benefits, and potential enhancement of this approach to support 
value-based medicine.

Since ERT for several LSDs treatment has emerged at the beginning of the 1980s 
with Orphan Drug approval, patients' expectancy and life quality have been 
improved. Most LSDs treatment are based on the replaced of mutated or deficient 
protein with the natural or recombinant protein.One of the main ERT drawback is 
the high drug prices. Therefore, different strategies trying to optimize the 
global ERT biotherapeutic production have been proposed. LVs, a gene delivery 
tool, can be proposed as an alternative method to generate stable cell lines in 
manufacturing of recombinant proteins. Since LVs have been used in human gene 
therapy, clinical trials, safety testing assays and procedures have been 
developed. Moreover, one of the main advantages of LVs strategy to obtain 
manufacturing cell line is the short period required as well as the high protein 
levels achieved.In this chapter, we will focus on LVs as a recombinant protein 
production platform and we will present a case study that employs LVs to express 
in a manufacturing cell line, alpha-Galactosidase A (rhαGAL), which is used as 
ERT for Fabry disease treatment.

The EORTC QLU-C10D is a new multi-attribute utility instrument derived from the 
widely used cancer-specific quality of life questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-C30. It 
contains 10 dimensions (physical functioning, role functioning, social 
functioning, emotional functioning, pain, fatigue, sleep, appetite, nausea, 
bowel problems), each with four levels. The aim of this study was to provide 
U.K. general population utility weights for the QLU-C10D. A U.K. online panel 
was quota-sampled to align the sample to the general population proportions of 
sex and age (≥18 years). The online valuation survey included a discrete choice 
experiment (DCE). Each participant was asked to complete 16 choice-pairs, each 
comprising two QLU-C10D health states plus duration. DCE data were analysed 
using conditional logistic regression to generate utility weights. Data from 
2,187 respondents who completed at least one choice set were included in the DCE 
analysis. The final U.K. QLU-C10D utility weights comprised decrements for each 
level of each health dimension. For nine of the 10 dimensions (all except 
appetite), the expected monotonic pattern was observed across levels: Utility 
decreased as severity increased. For the final model, consistent monotonicity 
was achieved by merging inconsistent adjacent levels for appetite. The largest 
utility decrements were associated with physical functioning and pain. The worst 
possible health state (the worst level of each dimension) is -0.083, which is 
considered slightly worse than being dead. The U.K.-specific utility weights 
will enable cost-utility analysis (CUA) for the economic evaluation of new 
oncology therapies and technologies in the United Kingdom, where CUA is commonly 
used to inform resource allocation.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with reduced life expectancy 
in patients with affective disorders, however, whether MetS also plays a role 
before the onset of affective disorder is unknown. We aimed to investigate 
whether MetS, inflammatory markers or oxidative stress act as risk factors for 
affective disorders, and whether MetS is associated with increased inflammation 
and oxidative stress.
METHODS: We conducted a high-risk study including 204 monozygotic (MZ) twins 
with unipolar or bipolar disorder in remission or partial remission (affected), 
their unaffected co-twins (high-risk) and twins with no personal or family 
history of affective disorder (low-risk). Metabolic Syndrome was ascertained 
according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Inflammatory 
markers and markers of oxidative stress were analyzed from fasting blood and 
urine samples, respectively.
RESULTS: The affected and the high-risk group had a significantly higher 
prevalence of MetS compared to the low-risk group (20% v. 15% v. 2.5%, p = 
0.0006), even after adjusting for sex, age, smoking and alcohol consumption. No 
differences in inflammatory and oxidative markers were seen between the three 
groups. Further, MetS was associated with alterations in inflammatory markers, 
and oxidative stress was modestly correlated with inflammation.
CONCLUSION: Metabolic syndrome is associated with low-grade inflammation and may 
act as a risk factor and a trait marker for affective disorders. If confirmed in 
longitudinal studies, this suggests the importance of early intervention and 
preventive approaches targeted towards unhealthy lifestyle factors that may 
contribute to later psychopathology.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the years of life lost by the Brazilian population due to 
mouth and pharynx cancer from 1979 to 2013, and analyze the temporal trends in 
the studied period, according to the country's region, sex and anatomical site.
METHODS: The death records were obtained from the Mortality Information System 
and the data referring to the population, from the censuses of the Brazilian 
Institute of Geography and Statistics of 1980, 1991, 2000, 2010, and from 
intercensal estimates for the other years. The rates of potential years of life 
lost were calculated by applying the method suggested by Romeder and McWhinnie, 
and their trends were calculated using the Prais-Winsten method with first-order 
autocorrelation. The historical series were smoothed with the centered moving 
average technique of third order for white noise reduction.
RESULTS: In the period from 1979 to 2013 in Brazil, there were a total of 
107,506 premature deaths due to mouth and pharynx cancer, which generated a 
total of 1,589,501 potential years of life lost, the equivalent to a rate of 3.6 
per 10,000 inhabitants. Males, whose rate was six times higher than for females, 
contributed with 85% of the years lost. The trends in the rates of years of life 
lost showed an annual 0.72% increase for men, 1.13% for women and 1.05% for 
pharynx cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of potential years of life lost due to mouth and pharynx 
cancer in the country showed an upward trend within the studied period for both 
sexes, as well as for pharynx cancer and for the North, Northeast and Midwest 
regions.

OBJETIVO: Estimar os anos de vida perdidos pela população brasileira devido ao 
câncer de boca e faringe de 1979 a 2013 e analisar a tendências temporais no

MÉTODOS: Os registros de óbitos foram obtidos do Sistema de Informações sobre 
Mortalidade e os dados referentes à população, dos censos do Instituto 
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística de 1980, 1991, 2000, 2010 e de estimativas 
intercensitárias para os demais anos. Foram calculadas as taxas de anos de vida 
potencialmente perdidos aplicando o método sugerido por Romeder e McWhinnie, e 
suas tendências foram calculadas usando o método de Prais-Winsten com correção 
para autocorrelação de primeira ordem. As séries históricas foram alisadas com 
técnica de média móvel central de ordem 3 para redução de ruído branco.
RESULTADOS: No período de 1979 a 2013 no Brasil, houve um total de 107.506 
mortes prematuras devido ao câncer de boca e faringe, o que gerou um total de 
1.589.501 anos potenciais de vida perdidos, equivalendo a uma taxa de 3,6 por 
10.000 habitantes. O sexo masculino, com uma taxa seis vezes maior que a do sexo 
feminino, contribuiu com 85% dos anos perdidos. As tendências das taxas de anos 
de vida perdidos mostraram aumento anual de 0,72% nos homens, 1,13% nas mulheres 
e 1,05% para o câncer de faringe.
CONCLUSÕES: A taxa de anos potenciais de vida perdidos por câncer de boca e 
faringe no país mostrou tendência de aumento dentro do período estudado em ambos 
os sexos, assim como para o câncer de faringe e para as regiões Norte, Nordeste 
e Centro-Oeste.

AIMS: Older patients with life-limiting illness (LLI) and limited life 
expectancy (LLE) continue to receive potentially inappropriate medicines, 
consequently deprescribing is often necessary. However, deprescribing in this 
population can be complex and challenging. Therefore, we aimed to investigate 
the evidence for outcomes of deprescribing interventions in older patients with 
LLI and LLE.
METHODS: Studies on deprescribing intervention and their outcomes in age ≥65 
years with LLI and LLE were searched using PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Medication 
appropriateness was primary outcome, while clinical and cost-related outcomes 
were secondary. Eligibility, data extraction and quality assessment were 
followed by a narrative synthesis of data.
RESULTS: Of 9 studies (1375 participants), 3 reported on primary outcome. One 
study showed a significant reduction in medication inappropriateness by 34.9% (P 
< .001) from admission to close-out, the second achieved 29.4% (P < .001) and 
15.1% (P = .003) reduction at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The third reported 
that their intervention stopped (17.2%) and altered the dose (2.6%) of high-risk 
medications. Commonly reported clinical outcomes were mortality (n = 3), quality 
of life (n = 2) and falls (n = 2). Outcomes in terms of cost were reported as 
overall cost (n = 2), medication cost (n = 1) and health care expenditure (n = 
1).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that deprescribing in older patients with LLI 
and LLE can improve medication appropriateness, and has potential for 
enhancement of several clinical outcomes and cost savings, but the evidence 
needs to be better established.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have the potential to help 
patients with chronic conditions such as hypertension by supporting 
self-management activities in daily life. However, the uptake of mHealth apps 
remains poor among patients. To improve the utilization of mHealth apps for 
hypertension, the analysis of the behavioral intention to use such applications 
must consider personality traits and illness-related perceptions.
METHOD: Adults with hypertension in Germany and Austria filled out a 
self-administered questionnaire in a cross-sectional study based on the 
UTAUT-model in order to identify potential predictors for the behavioral 
intention to use mHealth applications as an indicator for their early 
acceptance. Beyond the four core determinants of acceptance of the UTAUT 
(performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating 
conditions), self-efficacy, openness to experience and perceived health threat 
were analyzed as predictors.
RESULTS: 145 participants (mean age 52.51 years, SD 14.33; 60% female) completed 
the survey. Acceptance was moderate on average (M = 3.26, SD = 1.07, min 1 to 
max 5). In a multiple hierarchical regression, performance expectancy and effort 
expectancy were confirmed as significant predictors of acceptance (step 1, R2 = 
.57, p < .001), while self-efficacy could not be confirmed (step 2, p = .87). In 
addition, perceived health threat (β = .12, p < .05) and openness to experience 
(β = .22, p < .001) had a significant influence on acceptance of mHealth apps 
for hypertension (step 3, overall model with R2 = .62). Age showed a negative 
association with the intention to use (β = .22, p = .005) while no influence of 
gender could be found (p = .06).
CONCLUSION: Above expectations regarding effectiveness and usability, openness 
to experience and perceived health threat make a significant contribution in 
predicting the acceptance of mHealth solutions in the field of chronic diseases.

Treatment of cognitive deficits in brain tumour patients: current status and 
future directions.

Netherlands.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increased life expectancy in brain tumour patients had led to 
the need for strategies that preserve and improve cognitive functioning, as many 
patients suffer from cognitive deficits. The tumour itself, as well as antitumor 
treatment including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, supportive treatment 
and individual patient factors are associated with cognitive problems. Here, we 
review the recent literature on approaches that preserve and improve cognitive 
functioning, including pharmacological agents and rehabilitation programs.
RECENT FINDINGS: Minimizing cognitive dysfunction and improving cognitive 
functioning in brain tumour patients may be achieved both by preserving 
cognitive functioning during antitumor treatment, including techniques such as 
awake brain surgery, less invasive radiation therapies such as stereotactic 
radiotherapy and proton therapy, as well as with interventions including 
cognitive rehabilitation programmes. Novel rehabilitation programs including 
computer-based cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) programmes that can be 
adjusted to the specific patient needs and can be administered at home are 
promising. Furthermore, personalized/precision medicine approaches to identify 
patients who are at risk for cognitive decline may facilitate effective 
treatment strategies in the future.
SUMMARY: Cognitive functioning has gained greater awareness in the 
neuro-oncological community, and methods to preserve and improve cognitive 
functioning have been explored. Rehabilitation programmes for brain tumour 
patients should be further developed and referred to in clinical practice.

Crossover formation during meiosis in plants is required for proper chromosome 
segregation and is essential for crop breeding as it allows an (optimal) 
combination of traits by mixing parental alleles on each chromosome. Crossover 
formation commences with the production of a large number of DNA double-strand 
breaks, of which only a few result in crossovers. A small number of genes, which 
drive the resolution of DNA crossover intermediate structures towards 
non-crossovers, have been identified in Arabidopisis thaliana. In order to 
explore the potential of modification of these genes in interspecific hybrids 
between crops and their wild relatives towards increased production of 
crossovers, we have used CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenesis in an interspecific tomato 
hybrid to knockout RecQ4. A biallelic recq4 mutant was obtained in the F1 hybrid 
of Solanum lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium. Compared with the wild-type F1 
hybrid, the F1 recq4 mutant was shown to have a significant increase in 
crossovers: a 1.53-fold increase when directly observing ring bivalents in male 
meiocytes microscopically and a 1.8-fold extension of the genetic map when 
measured by analysing SNP markers in the progeny (F2) plants. This is one of the 
first demonstrations of increasing crossover frequency in interspecific hybrids 
by manipulating genes in crossover intermediate resolution pathways and the 
first to do so by directed mutagenesis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Increasing 
crossover frequency during meiosis can speed up or simplify crop breeding that 
relies on meiotic crossovers to introduce favourable alleles controlling 
important traits from wild relatives into crops. Here we show for the first time 
that knocking out an inhibitor of crossovers in an interspecific hybrid between 
tomato and its relative wild species using CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenesis results in 
increased recombination between the two genomes.

BACKGROUND: Endovenous laser ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy 
are recommended alternatives to surgery for the treatment of primary varicose 
veins, but their long-term comparative effectiveness remains uncertain.
METHODS: In a randomized, controlled trial involving 798 participants with 
primary varicose veins at 11 centers in the United Kingdom, we compared the 
outcomes of laser ablation, foam sclerotherapy, and surgery. Primary outcomes at 
5 years were disease-specific quality of life and generic quality of life, as 
well as cost-effectiveness based on models of expected costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained that used data on participants' 
treatment costs and scores on the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire.
RESULTS: Quality-of-life questionnaires were completed by 595 (75%) of the 798 
trial participants. After adjustment for baseline scores and other covariates, 
scores on the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (on which scores range from 0 
to 100, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life) were lower among 
patients who underwent laser ablation or surgery than among those who underwent 
foam sclerotherapy (effect size [adjusted differences between groups] for laser 
ablation vs. foam sclerotherapy, -2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.49 to 
-1.22; P<0.001; and for surgery vs. foam sclerotherapy, -2.60; 95% CI, -3.99 to 
-1.22; P<0.001). Generic quality-of-life measures did not differ among treatment 
groups. At a threshold willingness-to-pay ratio of £20,000 ($28,433 in U.S. 
dollars) per QALY, 77.2% of the cost-effectiveness model iterations favored 
laser ablation. In a two-way comparison between foam sclerotherapy and surgery, 
54.5% of the model iterations favored surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial of treatments for varicose veins, 
disease-specific quality of life 5 years after treatment was better after laser 
ablation or surgery than after foam sclerotherapy. The majority of the 
probabilistic cost-effectiveness model iterations favored laser ablation at a 
willingness-to-pay ratio of £20,000 ($28,433) per QALY. (Funded by the National 
Institute for Health Research; CLASS Current Controlled Trials number,

BACKGROUND: Haemophilia A is a hereditary bleeding disorder, which has been 
considered rare and chronic. The burden of this disease in Portugal remains 
unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the annualized cost and health 
burden of haemophilia A in Portugal.
METHODS: Data were extracted from a Portuguese expert panel, from official data 
and national literature. Annual costs were calculated from the perspective of 
the society including direct and indirect costs. Unitary costs were extracted 
from 2017 national official sources and are expressed in euros. Health burden 
was expressed in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) based on incidence and 
quality of life questionnaires. Estimates are presented for the overall 
population and stratified by severity, age group (< 18 years vs. adults) and 
inhibitor status.
RESULTS: The yearly average cost per patient is estimated to range from 
€39,654/patient without inhibitors and €302,189/patient with inhibitors, 
representing a 7.6 fold difference. Amongst patients without inhibitors, the 
annual average cost was €401 in mild, €5327 in moderate and €85,805 in severe 
disease. Average cost per child and adult is €72,287 and €51,737, respectively. 
Direct costs represent approximately 95% of all costs, of which almost the 
totality accounts for clotting factor replacement therapy and bypassing agents. 
The total annual cost of haemophilia A for the Portuguese society was estimated 
to be €42,66 million, one third of which was related to the treatment of 
patients with inhibitors. It is estimated that haemophilia A is responsible for 
3878 DALYs in Portugal (497 DALYs in mild, 524 DALYs in moderate, 2031 DALYs in 
severe patients without inhibitors and 784 DALYs in patients with inhibitors) 
for the cohort of 2017 (750 patients) or 5.2 DALY/patient during lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite being rare, the economic and health burden of haemophilia A 
is remarkable. The main cost driver is clotting factor replacement therapy. 
Moreover, haemophilia A is more costly in children than in adults and rises 
exponentially with disease severity.

With increased life expectancy worldwide, there is an urgent need for improving 
preventive measures that delay the development of age-related degenerative 
diseases. Here, we report evidence from mouse and human studies that this goal 
can be achieved by maintaining optimal hydration throughout life. We demonstrate 
that restricting the amount of drinking water shortens mouse lifespan with no 
major warning signs up to 14 months of life, followed by sharp deterioration. 
Mechanistically, water restriction yields stable metabolism remodeling toward 
metabolic water production with greater food intake and energy expenditure, an 
elevation of markers of inflammation and coagulation, accelerated decline of 
neuromuscular coordination, renal glomerular injury, and the development of 
cardiac fibrosis. In humans, analysis of data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities (ARIC) study revealed that hydration level, assessed at middle age 
by serum sodium concentration, is associated with markers of coagulation and 
inflammation and predicts the development of many age-related degenerative 
diseases 24 years later. The analysis estimates that improving hydration 
throughout life may greatly decrease the prevalence of degenerative diseases, 
with the most profound effect on dementia, heart failure (HF), and chronic lung 
disease (CLD), translating to the development of these diseases in 3 million 
fewer people in the United States alone.

A collateral consequence of mass incarceration in the United States is its 
negative effects on population health. Using data from 2015, this study examines 
the relationship between incarceration rates and population health for a 
national sample of U.S. counties. To obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of 
incarceration on health, we use multivariate models which account for the 
endogeneity of incarceration rates when determining their effect on population 
health by employing an instrumental variable approach where the robust 
instrumental (exogenous) variable per capita corrections expenditures is used to 
predict incarceration rate. We then estimate population health outcomes as a 
function of predicted incarceration rate alongside factors such as public health 
spending, indicators of health behavior and control variables in models 
explaining county-level population health. Consistent with findings from prior 
research on individuals, families and at the state level, results of our 
analyses indicate that higher levels of incarceration are associated with higher 
levels of both morbidity (percentage reporting fair or poor health) and 
mortality (life expectancy). Implications of these findings for health and 
criminal justice policy, as well as research, are considered.

BACKGROUND: Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) can be effective in controlling 
medically intractable symptoms of Tourette's syndrome (TS). There is no evidence 
to date, though, of the potential cost-effectiveness of DBS for this indication.
OBJECTIVE: To provide the first estimates of the likely cost-effectiveness of 
DBS in the treatment of severe TS.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using clinical data from 17 
Australian patients receiving DBS. Direct medical costs for DBS using 
non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries and for the alternative best medical 
treatment (BMT), and health utilities for BMT were sourced from the literature. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated using a Markov 
models with a 10-year time horizon and 5% discount rate.
RESULTS: DBS increased quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from 2.76 to 
4.60 over a 10-year time horizon. The ICER for DBS with non-rechargeable 
(rechargeable) batteries, compared to BMT, was A$33,838 (A$15,859) per QALY. The 
ICER estimates are sensitive to DBS costs and selected time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that DBS may be a cost-effective treatment for 
severe TS, based on the very limited clinical data available and under 
particular assumptions. While the limited availability of data presents a 
challenge, we also conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the 
results to the assumptions used in the analysis. We nevertheless recommend the 
implementation of randomised controlled trials that collect a comprehensive 
range of costs and the use of a widely accepted health-related quality of life 
instrument to enable more definitive statements about the cost-effectiveness of 
DBS for TS.

The elderly is passing from a stage to another new stage of life, with cognitive 
changes and a reduction in the physiological functions of this age. With 
increasing age, spiritual needs and attitudes increase. So, this study was 
conducted aimed to investigate the effect of group spiritual therapy on the 
cognitive state of the elderly. This experimental study was conducted in two 
experimental and control groups on 50 elderly people in Golestan Province in 
2012, by simple random sampling. Data collection tool was Mini-Mental State 
Examination. In the experimental group, eight group therapy sessions were 
performed for 45-60 min a week twice. The data were analyzed by software SPSS-16 
using descriptive statistics (mean score and SD) and inferential statistics 
(paired t test, independent t test and covariance test). Independent t test 
before the intervention in both groups showed no significant difference 
(P = 0.52). But this test showed a significant difference after the intervention 
(P < 0.01). Also, ANCOVA test showed a significant difference in both groups 
(η = 0.26) (P < 0/01) . Regarding the effect of group spiritual therapy on the 
cognitive state of the elderly, it can be used as a complementary, low cost and 
effective method for improving the cognitive state of the elderly. For this 
reason, it is recommended because spiritual therapy creates the concept and 
meaning of life and increases the life expectancy and quality of life in the 
elderly.

An analysis of the IS6/IS26 family of insertion sequences: is it a single 
family?

Harmer CJ(1), Hall RM(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney, NSW 2006, 
Australia.

The relationships within a curated set of 112 insertion sequences (ISs) 
currently assigned to the IS6 family, here re-named the IS6/IS26 family, in the 
ISFinder database were examined. The encoded DDE transposases include a 
helix-helix-turn-helix (H-HTH) potential DNA binding domain N-terminal to the 
catalytic (DDE) domain, but 10 from Clostridia include one or two additional 
N-terminal domains. The transposase phylogeny clearly separated 75 derived from 
bacteria from 37 from archaea. The longer bacterial transposases also clustered 
separately. The 65 shorter bacterial transposases, including Tnp26 from IS26, 
formed six clades but share significant conservation in the H-HTH domain and in 
a short extension at the N-terminus, and several amino acids in the catalytic 
domain are completely or highly conserved. At the outer ends of these ISs, 14 bp 
were strongly conserved as terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) with the first two 
bases (GG) and the seventh base (G) present in all except one IS. The longer 
bacterial transposases are only distantly related to the short bacterial 
transposases, with only some amino acids conserved. The TIR consensus was longer 
and only one IS started with GG. The 37 archaeal transposases are only distantly 
related to either the short or the long bacterial transposases and different 
residues were conserved. Their TIRs are loosely related to the bacterial TIR 
consensus but are longer and many do not begin with GG. As they do not fit well 
with most bacterial ISs, the inclusion of the archaeal ISs and the longer 
bacterial ISs in the IS6/IS26 family is not appropriate.

S5 7AU.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2016 Sep 01;9:CD006682.

BACKGROUND: Progressive lung damage from recurrent exacerbations is the major 
cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Life expectancy of people 
with cystic fibrosis has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. One of the 
major reasons for this increase is the mounting use of antibiotics to treat 
chest exacerbations caused by bacterial infections. The optimal duration of 
intravenous antibiotic therapy is not clearly defined. Individuals usually 
receive intravenous antibiotics for 14 days, but treatment may range from 10 to 
21 days. A shorter duration of antibiotic treatment risks inadequate clearance 
of infection which could lead to further lung damage. Prolonged courses of 
intravenous antibiotics are expensive and inconvenient. The risk of systemic 
side effects such as allergic reactions to antibiotics also increases with 
prolonged courses and the use of aminoglycosides requires frequent monitoring to 
minimise some of their side effects. However, some organisms which infect people 
with cystic fibrosis are known to be multi-resistant to antibiotics, and may 
require a longer course of treatment. This is an update of previously published 
reviews.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the optimal duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for 
treating chest exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive 
electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books 
and conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis 
Trials Register: 30 May 2019.We also searched online trials registries. Most 
recent search of the ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials 
Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal: 06 January 2019.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing 
different durations of intravenous antibiotic courses for acute respiratory 
exacerbations in people with CF, either with the same drugs at the same dosage, 
the same drugs at a different dosage or frequency or different antibiotics 
altogether, including studies with additional therapeutic agents.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No eligible trials were identified for inclusion. 
A trial looking at the standardised treatment of pulmonary exacerbations is 
currently ongoing and will be included when the results are published.  MAIN 
RESULTS: No eligible trials were included.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no clear guidelines on the optimum duration of 
intravenous antibiotic treatment. Duration of treatment is currently based on 
unit policies and response to treatment. Shorter duration of treatment should 
improve quality of life and adherence, result in a reduced incidence of drug 
reactions and be less costly. However, the shorter duration may not be 
sufficient to clear a chest infection and may result in an early recurrence of 
an exacerbation. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre, 
randomised controlled trial comparing different durations of intravenous 
antibiotic treatment as it has important clinical and financial implications. 
The currently ongoing STOP2 trial is expected to provide some guidance on these 
questions when published.
