BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) 
has previously conducted studies of bladder cancer incidence and mortality at a 
synthetic dye plant that manufactured beta-naphthylamine from 1940 through 1979. 
This report extends the period of mortality follow-up 13 years and analyzes both 
underlying and nonunderlying causes of death.
METHODS: The vital status of each cohort member, as of December 31, 1992, was 
determined by using the National Death Index and information from the Internal 
Revenue Service and the U.S. Postal Service. The NIOSH life table analysis 
system (LTAS) was used to generate person-year-at-risk and the expected numbers 
of death for 92 categories of death, using several referent rates (U.S. 
underlying, Georgia underlying, U.S. multiple cause).
RESULTS: There were three bladder cancer deaths listed as underlying cause, 
yielding a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) based on U.S. rates of 2.4 (95% 
confidence interval (CI) = 0.5, 7.0) and a total of eight bladder cancers listed 
anywhere on the death certificates (SMR based on multiple cause referent rates = 
5.6; 95% CI = 2.4, 11.1). Mortality from esophageal cancer, which had been 
significantly elevated in the previous study, was no longer significantly 
elevated (SMR = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.8, 4.1). Mortality from all causes was 
significantly higher than expected (SMR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.3, 1.6).
CONCLUSIONS: The elevated bladder cancer risk in this cohort was detected by the 
multiple cause, but not the underlying cause, analysis. Elevated mortality from 
other causes of death, especially among short-term workers, may be related to 
regional and lifestyle factors.

The genetics of caloric restriction in Caenorhabditis elegans.

Québec, Canada H3A 1B1.

Low caloric intake (caloric restriction) can lengthen the life span of a wide 
range of animals and possibly even of humans. To understand better how caloric 
restriction lengthens life span, we used genetic methods and criteria to 
investigate its mechanism of action in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Mutations in many genes (eat genes) result in partial starvation of the worm by 
disrupting the function of the pharynx, the feeding organ. We found that most 
eat mutations significantly lengthen life span (by up to 50%). In C. elegans, 
mutations in a number of other genes that can extend life span have been found. 
Two genetically distinct mechanisms of life span extension are known: a 
mechanism involving genes that regulate dauer formation (age-1, daf-2, daf-16, 
and daf-28) and a mechanism involving genes that affect the rate of development 
and behavior (clk-1, clk-2, clk-3, and gro-1). We find that the long life of 
eat-2 mutants does not require the activity of DAF-16 and that eat-2; daf-2 
double mutants live even longer than extremely long-lived daf-2 mutants. These 
findings demonstrate that food restriction lengthens life span by a mechanism 
distinct from that of dauer-formation mutants. In contrast, we find that food 
restriction does not further increase the life span of long-lived clk-1 mutants, 
suggesting that clk-1 and caloric restriction affect similar processes.

BACKGROUND: The customer's final satisfaction with health services depends to 
some extent, on the relationship between expectancy and perceived quality. Focus 
groups technique helps in the knowledge of those attributes that patients 
identified as perceived quality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed in the Hospital Clínic i 
Provincial of Barcelona (HCPB), Spain, by selecting a sample of patient's 
included in the admission's waiting list (1994) of three common procedures: lens 
extraction, abdominal hernia repair and routine pregnancy control. The patients 
were distributed in 12 different semi-structured interview groups (focus groups) 
and video-taped. From the analysis of those tapes, the main concerns and aspects 
highlighted by consumers were identified, following a common set of rules: 
wording, context, internal consistency, precision/vagueness of answers and basic 
ideas.
RESULTS: A total of 106 patients attend the interview. Patients with loss of 
visual acuity underscore the contribution of quality of life improvement 
expected from the procedure (technical quality of the surgical procedure, 
physical improvement and final outcomes). Patient's with abdominal hernia repair 
highlight the appearance and comfort of hospital setting as the most important 
item. Pregnant women emphasize the importance of a good follow-up process after 
delivery, as well as the need for individual services (dignity and intimate).
CONCLUSION: The semi-structured interview method (focus group) could be applied 
in the context of our hospitals, and contribute to improve quality management at 
our institutions, making effective the patient participation.

Regulation of motility behavior in Myxococcus xanthus may require an 
extracytoplasmic-function sigma factor.

California 94720-3204, USA.

Using interaction trap technology, we identified a putative 
extracytoplasmic-function (ECF) sigma factor (RpoE1) in Myxococcus xanthus, a 
bacterium which has a complex life cycle that includes fruiting body formation. 
The first domain of the response regulator protein FrzZ, a component of the Frz 
signal transduction system, was used as bait. Although the RpoE1 protein 
displayed no interactions with control proteins presented as bait, a weak 
interaction with a second M. xanthus response regulator (AsgA) was observed. 
While the specificity of the FrzZ-RpoE1 interaction therefore remains 
speculative, cloning and sequencing of the region surrounding rpoE1 localized it 
to a position downstream of the frzZ gene. A potential promoter site for binding 
of an ECF sigma factor was identified upstream of rpoE1, suggesting the gene may 
be autoregulated. However, primer extension studies suggested that transcription 
of rpoE1 occurs under both vegetative and developmental conditions from a 
sigma70-like promoter. Dot blot analysis of RNA preparations confirmed the 
low-level, constitutive expression of rpoE1 during both stages of the life 
cycle. Analysis of an insertion mutant also indicated a role for RpoE1 under 
both vegetative and developmental conditions, since swarming was reduced on 
nutrient-rich agar and developmental aggregation was effected under starvation 
conditions, especially at high cell densities. An insertion mutation introduced 
into the gene directly downstream of rpoE1 (orf5) did not result in either 
swarming or developmental aggregation defects, even though the gene is 
transcribed as part of the same operon. Therefore, we propose that this new ECF 
sigma factor could play a role in the transcriptional regulation of genes 
involved in motility behavior during both stages of the complex M. xanthus life 
cycle.

The brain tumor experience and quality of life: a qualitative study.

Fox S(1), Lantz C.

Author information:

Richmond 23298, USA.

Despite the attention given to quality of life (QOL) in persons with cancer, 
very little is currently know about QOL in persons with brain tumors. In the 
past twenty years, less than twenty articles reflect the actual measurement of 
QOL in adult brain tumor population. The shortage of QOL studies is disturbing 
considering the slow progress made in extending the life expectancy of many 
brain tumor patients and the toxicities of many existing treatment protocols. 
This qualitative study was undertaken to begin to fill the gaps in the existing 
literature and to more clearly define QOL in persons with brain tumors. The 
researchers used an exploratory, descriptive design involving semi-structured 
interviews of adults with brain tumors and their significant others. 
Twenty-three adults with brain tumors and 21 significant others were 
interviewed. Data analysis of interview transcripts focused on the 
identification of key variables contributing to the QOL of adults with brain 
tumors. Using constant comparative methods, it was found that data could be 
organized into five thematic categories: (1) The Stigma of a Mind-Body Illness, 
(2) An Invasive Disease of the Self, (3) My Family has a Brain Tumor, (4) 
Dealing with the Medical Diplomats, and (5) Quality of Life: No Substitute for 
Living. These emerging themes provide information which clinicians caring for 
brain tumor patients can use to provide care and anticipatory guidance. Unique 
areas for further research elicited in the study include exploration of the 
"loss of self" theme, how persons use their estimations of QOL in 
decision-making and examination of the balance between the need for survival and 
maintaining QOL.

A view of the future of end-stage renal disease care: the patient's perspective.

White JD(1).

Author information:
(1)Joe_White@es.adp.com

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) care is sustaining the lives of over 300,000 
individuals today, but with a quality of life and life expectancy that is less 
than desirable. Nearly 500,000 individuals will be ESRD patients in the year 
2005. Will they receive better ESRD care in 2005 than patients receive today? 
ESRD care modalities are examined in terms of effectiveness (quality of life and 
life expectancy), accessibility, and affordability from the patient's 
perspective. Developmental programs with potential to improve ESRD care within 
the next 5 years are reviewed for potential impact on effectiveness, 
accessibility, and affordability. The potential effects of global capitation on 
the quality of ESRD care and the successful development of advanced renal 
replacement therapies are also examined.

An interim determination of health gain from oral cancer and precancer 
screening: 3. Preselecting high risk individuals.

Downer MC(1), Jullien JA, Speight PM.

Author information:
(1)Eastman Dental Institute, London, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a sensitivity analysis using a decision model for 
simulating opportunistic screening for oral cancer and precancer in order to 
obtain an estimate of health gain from screening high risk dental patients, 
identified with the aid of artificial intelligence.
DESIGN: A hypothetical opportunistic screening programme based on preselection 
of high risk patients was compared with screening all eligible patients and with 
a 'do nothing' scenario. The basic assumptions and data used in the model have 
been described previously.
SETTING: Screening would be carried out in dental practices.
PARTICIPANTS: A notional population of 100,000 adults of average age 55 years 
and 20 years life expectancy.
INTERVENTIONS: Systematic clinical examination of the oral mucosa of high risk 
individuals identified by artificial intelligence on the basis of personal 
characteristics and life style.
OUTCOME MEASURES: QALYs and equivalent lives saved
RESULTS: The following estimates of health gain were obtained: the preselected 
screened group (n = 25,000) would achieve 1,993,294 QALYs. Without preselection, 
screening an unselected population of 100,000 eligible adults would result in 
1,993,094 QALYs. Under the 'do nothing' scenario, 100,000 unscreened individuals 
would achieve 1,992,982 QALYs. Selective screening could avoid the equivalent of 
15 deaths per 100,000 subjects examined. Screening preselected subjects at 
heightened risk would save the equivalent of two to three times the number of 
healthy lives compared with non-selective screening. Only one quarter of the 
population would need to be examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic screening of preselected dental patients for oral 
cancer and precancer appears to be a promising health promotion strategy and 
should be subject to formal economic appraisal.

Multiple myeloma index: verification of a new prognostic approach with 
evaluation of treatment response.

Bettini R(1), Tonolini M, Bernasconi M.

Author information:
(1)Divisione di Medicina Generale, Ospedale F. Del Ponte, Varese, Italy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Currently adopted prognostic criteria for multiple 
myeloma (MM) still lack reliable predictive ability to select subsets of 
patients for different therapies, in particular for intensive treatment 
protocols. In this work we aimed to test the prognostic value of the MM 
Prognostic Index (MMPI), developed in 1996 by Grignani et al. from Pavia 
University as a clinical and investigational tool.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-three MM patients were eligible for the study. All 
received initial induction therapy based on a standard 6-month melphalan + 
prednisone (M + P) protocol. Clinical and laboratory parameters, conventional 
staging and bone marrow infiltration percentage and cytopathology (BMIC) were 
assessed at diagnosis, while treatment response (TR) was evaluated using 
criteria after induction therapy. Cox's multivariate survival analysis was 
applied on prognostic data.
RESULTS: In our patients independent prognostic value was confirmed for British 
Medical Research Council staging, BMIC and TR, the three factors considered in 
MMPI. Risk classes obtained via MMPI identify patients with different outcomes; 
moreover, the index discriminates significantly among Stage II patients.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This new approach to MM prognosis is simple and 
reliable from the prognostic point of view; it refers not only to neoplastic 
mass, but also to intrinsic proliferative capacity of the malignant clone and to 
tumor-host interactions. We recommend its adoption in clinical practice and in 
the evaluation and design of therapeutic trials.

Seasonal variation in mortality in Moscow.

McKee M(1), Sanderson C, Chenet L, Vassin S, Shkolnikov V.

Author information:
(1)London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

BACKGROUND: Seasonal variation in mortality has been investigated in many 
countries but not, until recently, in Russia. There are some grounds for 
suspecting that it may differ in Russia from what is seen in western countries. 
This paper explores patterns of seasonal variation in mortality in Moscow 
between 1993 and 1995.
METHODS: Analysis was based on individual data on deaths occurring in Moscow 
between January 1993 and December 1995, grouped by four-week period and by 
calendar month and on mean monthly temperature in Moscow for the same period. 
Crude, smoothed and deseasonalized trends were inspected. Auto-correlation 
functions were estimated and deaths were regressed against temperature.
RESULTS: As in other northern hemisphere countries, there is a winter excess of 
deaths but this is much smaller than in many western countries. It is restricted 
to some causes of death, such as ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular 
disease, and is associated with low temperature. In contrast, there is a marked 
summer increase in deaths among young people, especially from accidents and 
other deaths associated with alcohol consumption. Over the three-year period 
studied, there was an initial underlying increase in alcohol-related deaths that 
subsequently fell, coinciding with a previously observed increase in life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the low level of excess winter mortality 
reflects warmer indoor environments than in the west. The seasonal variation of 
deaths among young people reinforces evidence of the important role of alcohol 
in the Russian mortality crisis.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate hypertension's long-term cost and impact on life 
expectancy.
DESIGN: A 19-year individual follow-up study. Subjects were categorized 
according to their baseline (1972) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) level into 
three groups: normotensive (DBP < 95 mmHg), mildly hypertensive (DBP 95-104 
mmHg), and severely hypertensive (DBP > 104 mmHg). By using their social 
security identification numbers, we linked the subjects to a set of national 
registers covering hospital admissions, use of major drugs, absence due to 
sickness, disability pensions, and deaths.
SUBJECTS: A random population sample of 10 284 men and women aged 25-59 years 
from the provinces of Kuopio and North Karelia in eastern Finland.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The numbers of years of life and years of work lost, the 
cost of drugs and hospitalization, and the value of productivity lost due to 
disability and premature mortality.
RESULTS: The difference in life expectancy between normotensive and severely 
hypertensive men was 2.7 years, of which 2.0 years was due to cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Among women the corresponding differences were 2.0 and 1.5 years. 
Severely hypertensive men lost 2.6 years of work more than did normotensive men, 
of which 1.7 years was due to CVD. Among women the differences were 2.2 and 1.3 
years. The mean undiscounted total costs (USA dollars at 1992 prices) were $132 
500 among normotensive, $146 500 among mildly hypertensive, and $219 300 among 
severely hypertensive men, of which CVD accounted for 28, 39, and 43%, 
respectively. More than 90% of the total costs were indirect productivity 
losses. Among women the total costs were lower for all DBP categories, as were 
the shares of CVD-related costs. The proportional increase in costs on going 
from the lowest to the highest DBP category was, however, somewhat larger among 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: On the population level, severe hypertension leads to considerable 
losses in terms of years of life lost, years of work lost, and costs. However, 
the overall impact of mild hypertension is much more limited.

Prolonged treatment with interferon in patients with histologically mild chronic 
hepatitis C: a decision analysis.

Davis GL(1), Beck JR, Farrell G, Poynard T.

Author information:
(1)Section of Hepatobiliary Diseases, University of Florida College of Medicine, 
Gainesville, USA.

Short courses (6 months) of interferon (IFN) are highly cost-effective in 
patients with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C. However, IFN treatment 
lasting 12-24 months is now the standard of care. We utilized a previously 
published and validated model of the natural history of chronic hepatitis C and 
the treatment outcomes from two large multicentre treatment trials of IFN-alpha 
2b, given for 6 months or 18-24 months, to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of prolonged IFN treatment in patients with histologically 
mild chronic hepatitis C (formerly chronic persistent or mild chronic active 
hepatitis). In the two treatment trials, pooled analysis of the patients with 
mild hepatitis showed that 36.4% of them normalized serum alanine 
aminotransferase and remained virus negative (sustained response) after 
completing an 18-24 month course of IFN vs 15.3% for a 6-month course and no 
response in the absence of treatment. The model then estimated that for patients 
aged 20-50 years, the discounted marginal cost per year of life gained by 
long-term IFN treatment ranged from US $735 to US $8856, and the gain in life 
expectancy ranged from 4.35 years to 0.75 years, respectively, compared with an 
untreated age-matched cohort. Compared with treatment for only 6 months, the 
incremental marginal cost per life year gained by longer treatment at age 20-50 
years ranged from $938 to $9957. The treatment and healthcare costs, sustained 
response rates and the rate of progression during early disease were identified 
as significant variables in sensitivity analyses. However, longer treatment 
always showed a survival benefit compared with 6 months of IFN or no treatment, 
and the cost of longer treatment is reasonable compared with that for a 6-month 
course.

Coronary heart disease mortality amongst non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects 
in Iceland: the independent effect of diabetes. The Reykjavik Study 17-year 
follow up.

Vilbergsson S(1), Sigurdsson G, Sigvaldason H, Sigfusson N.

Author information:

Medicine, Reykjavik.

OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this study was to estimate the independent risk for 
coronary heart disease (CHD) death associated with non-insulin dependent (Type 
2) diabetes (NIDDM) and effect on life expectancy.
DESIGN AND SETTING: The Reykjavik Study is a prospective cardiovascular 
population study which started in 1967. A randomized selection procedure 
identified individuals for invitation to participate, based on their year and 
date of birth. Participants were examined in the years 1967-91 in one research 
clinic in Reykjavik.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The population in this survey were Icelandic Caucasian 
males and females, born 1907-35 and therefore 34-79 years old when their 
examination was performed. Altogether 9139 males and 9773 females attended, and 
of those 267 males and 210 female were NIDDM as defined by a questionnaire or an 
oral glucose tolerance test. Other factors measured in the study included 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, 
uric acid, smoking habits, height, and weight. The causes of death were 
determined by a review of all death certificates. Results. The relative risk of 
death from CHD (95% confidence limits), independently associated with NIDDM, was 
2.0 (1.5-2.6) for males and 2.4 (1.6-3.6) for females. The relative risk of 
death from all causes was 1.9 (1.6-2.3) and 1.7 (1.3-2.1), respectively, for 
male and female diabetic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus carried twice the risk of 
CHD death in both sexes, independently of other risk factors. The diagnosis of 
NIDDM at the age 55 years reduced an individual's life expectancy by about five 
years, mostly because of increased CHD death rate.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2759 breast cancer cases diagnosed in 1988.
MAIN RESULTS: Tumors were classified as ductal, lobular, and mixed/unspecified 
carcinoma. Ductal carcinoma was the most common (83.6%) and lobular carcinoma 
was the rarest. Most cases were diagnosed in the localized stage (56.3%). 
Caucasian women had the highest rates of total breast cancer (240.9/100,000), 
ductal and lobular. In African-American women, the odds of ductal carcinoma were 
twice that of lobular carcinoma, compared with Caucasian women (odds ratio [OR] 
= 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-3.9) after adjusting for age, site, and 
stage at diagnosis. Similarly, Asian and Hispanic women also had higher, 
non-statistically significant odds of ductal versus lobular carcinoma compared 
with Caucasians (OR = 1.8 [95% CI 0.9-3.7] and 1.6 [95% CI 0.8-3.4], 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should investigate how racial/ethnic differences in 
histology among breast cancer patients will influence life expectancy, against a 
backdrop of health care access, sociocultural issues, lifestyle habits, 
reproductive history, family history, and tumor characteristics.

Age at death and rectangularisation of the survival curve: trends in 
Switzerland, 1969-1994.

Paccaud F(1), Sidoti Pinto C, Marazzi A, Mili J.

Author information:
(1)Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, University 
of Lausanne, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: To check if signs of rectangularisation of the survival curve 
appeared during recent decades in Switzerland--that is, if life expectancy is 
approaching a maximum with a clustering of age at death around an average value 
(the so called "compression of mortality").
METHODS: Descriptive analysis of age of death and its trends over 26 years, as 
characterised by the modal value, median, and various percentiles beyond the 
median.
POPULATION: All deaths occurring after the 50th birthday in Switzerland between 
1969 and 1994 (n = 1,390,362).
MAIN RESULTS: Age at death is increasing at a sustained rate at all percentiles 
equal or greater than 50, without any slow down in the trend during this period. 
The increase is more marked among women. Rates of increase are diminishing as 
the percentiles of age at death are higher, suggesting some clustering of deaths 
beyond the median value. However, the maximum age at death, if any, seems to be 
far from the current median values, even for women who enjoy a relatively high 
median age at death.

    Postgrad Med J. 1999 May;75(883):316.

Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation is likely to have an increasing 
role in the management of acute ventilatory failure, weaning, and chronic 
ventilatory problems. Further improvements in ventilator and mask design will be 
seen. Appropriate application is likely to reduce both mortality and admissions 
to intensive care, while domiciliary use can improve life expectancy and/or 
quality of life in chronic ventilatory disorders. As with any new technique, 
enthusiasm should not outweigh clear outcome information, and possible new 
indications should always be subject to careful assessment.

Angina pectoris in a contemporary population: characteristics and therapeutic 
implications. TIDES Investigators.

We characterized a contemporary, nonhospitalized population with angina pectoris 
by obtaining data from a geographically diverse cohort of 5125 outpatients with 
chronic stable angina cared for by 1266 primary-care physicians. Diagnosis was 
based on history supported by evidence for coronary artery disease (coronary 
angiography, old myocardial infarction [MI], and/or an abnormal stress test). 
Their mean age was 69 years and 53% were women. Seventy percent had more than 
one associated illness, and 65% used more than one cardiovascular drug. Calcium 
antagonists (46%) and nitrates (61%) were used most frequently. Median angina 
frequency was approximately 2 episodes/week, and increased angina frequency was 
associated (P < 0.0001) with decreased overall feeling of well-being. Although 
effort angina was present in 90% of patients, 47% also had rest angina and 34% 
had mental stress-evoked angina. Female gender (odds ratio: 1.09; 95% CI: 
1.02-1.16), concomitant illness (1.17, 1.09-1.25), and pharmacotherapy (1.14, 
1.07-1.22) were associated with rest angina. Younger age (1.30, 1.20-1.41), 
female gender (1.16, 1.07-1.26), concomitant illness (1.13, 1.03-1.24), and 
pharmacotherapy (1.28, 1.15-1.93) were associated with mental stress angina. 
Calcium antagonists were used for rest-evoked (1.09, 1.03-1.16) and mental 
stress-evoked (1.12, 1.04-1.21) angina. These data suggest that contemporary 
outpatients with angina are most likely to be women and elderly patients with 
high frequencies of associated illness, calcium antagonist and nitrate use, as 
well as rest- and mental stress-related angina. These characteristics differ 
from previous perceptions.

Therapeutic options and cost considerations in the treatment of ischemic heart 
disease.

Cleland JG(1), Walker A.

Author information:

Ischemic heart disease is a serious health problem because it causes 
considerable mortality and morbidity. Given the limited resources for health 
care, it is important to establish the costs associated with the benefits of its 
various treatment options. We therefore assessed the costs and benefits of 
medical treatment versus revascularization in a hypothetical cohort of 100 
patients. A spreadsheet model was constructed using published data. The main 
outputs of this model were health-service costs per year and quality-adjusted 
survival estimates. In the United Kingdom, costs for treatments of less than 
5,000 Pounds/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) are perceived as highly cost 
effective, whereas those over 10,000 Pounds/QALY are considered expensive. For 
patients with intractable symptoms, surgery is highly effective and has benefits 
on prognosis. In patients with well-controlled symptoms on medical therapy, the 
benefits of surgery are small and uncertain, and therefore medical therapy is 
the most cost-effective treatment. Overall, the preferred cost-effective option 
favored medical treatment.

Absence of dosage compensation at the transcription level of a sex-linked gene 
in a female heterogametic insect, Bombyx mori.

Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.

To confirm whether sex-linked genes of the silkworm are dosage compensated or 
not, we investigated three RAPDs and one RFLP marker which have been mapped to 
the Z chromosome as candidate genes to test for dosage compensation. Northern 
blot analysis demonstrated that one of the RAPDs, T15.180a, is transcribed into 
several mRNAs in the embryo, midgut, Malpighian tubule, testis and ovary. 
Southern blot analysis revealed that T15.180a is present at one copy in the 
genome. Sequence data showed that T15.180a contained two open-reading frames 
(ORFs) separated by an intron of 605 bp. These ORFs encoded a possible 
polypeptide of 445 amino acids containing the proline cluster. These results 
suggested that T15.180a is part of a functional gene on the Z chromosome of the 
silkworm. We have called this gene T15, and compared its transcriptional level 
between males and females. Northern blot analysis showed that the level of T15 
mRNA in males was twice that of females. For a more precise analysis, the levels 
of transcription from both alleles of T15 (T15P, T15C) were measured by the 
single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) assay. The results indicated that the 
amount of transcription from each T15 allele in both sexes (male, T15P/T15C; 
female, T15P/W) was equivalent. All the results suggest that sex-linked genes in 
the silkworm are not dosage compensated.

Asymptomatic aneurysms. Literature meta-analysis and indications for treatment.

Tomasello F(1), D'Avella D, Salpietro FM, Longo M.

Author information:
(1)Neurosurgical Clinic, University of Messina, Italy.

Autopsy and angiographic studies indicate that cerebral aneurysms occur in an 
estimated 0.2% to 8.9% of the general population. Modern noninvasive imaging 
techniques now detect these lesions in ever increasing numbers, and 
neurosurgeons are faced with a difficult decision about whether to recommend 
surgical treatment of incidentally discovered asymptomatic unruptured aneurysms 
(AA). While in the past an expectant management was generally recommended for 
AA, elective surgery is now advocated because of the risk of bleeding of the 
untreated aneurysm and the low operative morbidity and mortality rates of modern 
microneurosurgery. We performed a meta-analysis of the literature on morbidity 
and mortality from elective surgery for AA to obtain a more generalizable 
estimate of operative risk than is currently available. Our meta-analysis 
contained 19 series consisting of 343 cases of elective surgery for AA. There 
was a total of 3 deaths for a combined mortality rate of 0.87%, and a total of 
15 deficits for a combined morbidity rate of 4.3%. These results compare 
favorably with the 10.3% natural history cumulative risk of mortality for 
unruptured aneurysms. The authors' personal experience with AA management was 
also reviewed and a particularly significant illustrative case is briefly 
reported. We recommend treatment for all asymptomatic aneurysms incidentally 
discovered particularly if: a) the aneurysm size is greater than 5 mm and 
arterial hypertension is present; b) the patient is otherwise healthy; c) the 
estimated life expectancy is > or = 10 years.

Prostate cancer in the elderly.

Kirk D(1).

Author information:
(1)Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, UK.

The incidence of prostate cancer is age related and increased longevity 
increases the number of elderly men with the disease. Management of prostate 
cancer in the elderly requires a different approach. Screening and aggressive 
case finding to seek out early confined disease are contraindicated in those 
with a life expectation below 10 years. Early confined disease in the elderly is 
usually managed expectantly. Hormone treatment is more appropriate for locally 
advanced disease, and is a valuable non-surgical treatment for bladder outflow 
obstruction due to prostate cancer. A significant proportion of elderly men with 
prostate cancer still die from other diseases. Hormone refractory disease in the 
elderly should be managed by palliation of symptoms rather than toxic 
second-line therapies. The aim always is diagnosis where appropriate, treatment 
which will be of benefit, and quality rather than length of life.

Radiotherapy in the elderly.

Pignon T(1), Scalliet P.

Author information:
(1)Service de Radiothérapie-Oncologie, Hôpital de la Timone, Marseille, France.

Older patients with cancer are frequently victims of discriminatory treatment 
strategies according to parameters unrelated to the tumour itself. The general 
approach is influenced by the belief that good tolerance to radiotherapy might 
be compromised in older patients and that the course of cancer might be less 
aggressive in this age group. Substandard treatment is therefore often offered 
to older patients, although this attitude is supported neither by clinical nor 
by scientific evidence, but rather stems from a lack of specific knowledge of 
the actual cancer prognosis and the tolerance to radiotherapy in the elderly. In 
clinical practice advanced age may result in undertreatment, even though 
patients may have no other medical illness and no functional impairment. Some 
comorbid conditions which are more frequent in older patients may complicate the 
outcome of treatment. However, these impaired vital functions are not an 
intrinsic feature of the elderly. Overall, noncompliance in radiotherapy, 
related to comorbidity or technical condition, is rare. Short-term radiotherapy 
using a large daily fraction is often advocated in elderly patients; however, 
this should only be considered if a palliative treatment option has previously 
been selected due to the high risk of late side-effects. Acute side-effects 
often result in decreasing doses of radiotherapy. Data on acute tolerance of 
radiotherapy for different types of tumours did not demonstrate a radical 
difference in occurrence of toxicities. 'Reducing' radiotherapy is never a 
solution, unless the life expectancy of the patient is obviously so short that 
the tumour recurrence is unlikely to occur or at least to produce substantial 
morbidity before the patient has died from other causes.

Chemotherapy in the elderly.

Wilking N(1).

Author information:
(1)Radiumhemmet, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. nwi@rah.ks.se

Much of the increase in cancer incidence is explained by the increasing number 
of elderly in the population. Even at a relatively advanced age, many have a 
life expectancy in the range of, or longer than, the expected 5- or 10-year 
survival of the malignant disease diagnosed. There are some specific problems 
related to treatment with chemotherapy in this age group. There is a decline in 
organ function, especially renal and cardiac, as well as other limitations in 
relation to vision, hearing and mobility. This means that we have to adopt a 
different attitude both to indications for chemotherapy and to what agents to 
use. Social and socioeconomic factors also have to be taken into consideration.

Oestrogen receptor status predicts local recurrence following breast 
conservation surgery for early breast cancer.

Yaghan R(1), Stanton PD, Robertson KW, Going JJ, Murray GD, McArdle CS.

Author information:
(1)University Department of Surgery, Glasgow Royal Infirmary.

AIMS: To evaluate factors predicting locoregional recurrence in patients treated 
for early breast carcinoma by breast conservation surgery with or without 
radiotherapy.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 256 patients was carried out, with special 
emphasis on the role of oestrogen receptor status. Other parameters studied 
included age, menopausal status, size of primary tumour, tumour type, axillary 
nodal status and adjuvant therapy.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed the following parameters to be independent 
predictors of locoregional recurrence. Radiotherapy (57% reduction in hazard, P 
= 0.004): expression of oestrogen receptors (52% reduction in hazard, P = 
0.008); tamoxifen therapy (46% reduction in hazard, P = 0.023); tumour size (40% 
increase in hazard per cm, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Within this study, lack of oestrogen receptor expression was a 
strong independent factor associated with a higher rate of locoregional 
recurrence. This may be of value in selecting a group of patients less suitable 
for breast conservation surgery.

Outcomes research: a review.

Gerszten PC(1).

Author information:

Pennsylvania, USA.

Comment in
    Neurosurgery. 1999 Apr;44(4):919-20.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to review the history of the medical 
outcomes movement as well as the methodologies used in outcomes research.
CONCEPT: Outcomes research refers to a genre of clinical investigation that 
emphasizes the measurement of patient health outcomes, including the patient's 
symptoms, functional status, quality of life, satisfaction with treatment, and 
health care costs.
RATIONALE: Outcomes research evolved from studies that demonstrated the presence 
of wide geographic variations in the practice of medicine and surgery. Such 
differences in utilization were unaccompanied by any discernible difference in 
patient outcomes. With escalating health care costs, there has been a growing 
interest in measuring the outcomes of medical intervention to determine the 
quality and appropriateness of medical care.
DISCUSSION: Outcomes may be measured both directly and indirectly, over 
differing periods of time, and with varying degrees of objectivity, reliability, 
and validity. Current research has focused on quality of life issues, which 
include the extent to which a patient's usual or expected physical, emotional, 
and social well-being have been affected by a medical condition or treatment. 
The true value of health care can be determined only by a systematic examination 
of patient outcomes. To accomplish this goal, methods are required that are 
relatively unfamiliar to many clinical researchers. Future clinical research 
should include patient-oriented outcome measures that would otherwise focus 
solely on physiological or anatomic outcomes. Such information will be essential 
in determining which medical and surgical treatment strategies should be 
abandoned and which will gain acceptance in the future.
