Facial pain occurs in approximately 80% of patients with head and neck cancers. 
Pain in these settings may result directly from the tumor, or indirectly as a 
side effect of oncological treatment of the tumor. Optimizing treatment for 
cancer pain of the face, therefore, involves a variety of diagnostic and 
treatment considerations, with the development of a successful treatment 
algorithm dependent on accurate diagnosis of the anatomical location of the 
pain, its relationship to the facial pain pathway, the type of pain being 
treated and, finally, patient's prognosis and preference for treatment modality. 
Beyond direct treatments to reduce tumor burden, a wide variety of 
neuro-ablative and neuro-augmentative approaches are available that may be 
tailored to a patient's specific pain syndrome and individual clinical context, 
taking into account the patient's treatment goals, life expectancy, other 
cancer-related medical problems, and end-of-life issues.

Tetrastichus giffardianus is a gregarious koinobiont endoparasitoid of 
tephritids, including Ceratitis capitata, which is one of the most important 
fruit pests worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
constant temperatures on the biology and development of the egg-adult period of 
T. giffardianus in larvae/pupae of C. capitata to construct a fertility life 
table. The study was carried out in climatic chambers at constant temperatures 
of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10% relative humidity and a photophase of 
12 h. Complete egg and larval development occurred only at temperatures of 20, 
25, and 30°C. The mean longevity of males and females was inversely proportional 
to temperature. The time of development of the pre-imaginal period was 
influenced by temperature and ranged from 41 days at 20°C to 11 days at 25°C. 
The best T. giffardianus performance occurred at 25°C when the intrinsic rate of 
increase was 0.21, the mean generation time was 20.43 days, the time required to 
double the population was 3.33 days, and the finite rate of population increase 
(λ) was 1.23. The results of this study provided information for the 
establishment of mass rearing and an evaluation of the adaptability of T. 
giffardianus to different environments, which is necessary for the use of this 
parasitoid in the biological control of tephritid pests, particularly C. 
capitata.

Fungal pathogens are seriously threatening food security and natural ecosystems; 
efficient and environmentally friendly control methods are essential to help 
safeguard such resources for increasing human populations on a global scale. 
Here, we find that Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a widespread pathogen of 
dicotyledons, can grow endophytically in wheat, rice, barley, maize, and oat, 
providing protection against Fusarium head blight, stripe rust, and rice blast. 
Protection is also provided by disabled S. sclerotiorum strains harboring a 
hypovirulence virus. The disabled strain DT-8 promoted wheat yields by 4-18% in 
the field and consistently reduced Fusarium disease by 40-60% across multiple 
field trials. We term the host-dependent trophism of S. sclerotiorum, 
destructively pathogenic or mutualistically endophytic, as schizotrophism. As a 
biotroph, S. sclerotiorum modified the expression of wheat genes involved in 
disease resistance and photosynthesis and increased the level of IAA. Our study 
shows that a broad-spectrum pathogen of one group of plants may be employed as a 
biocontrol agent in a different group of plants where they can be utilized as 
beneficial microorganisms while avoiding the risk of in-field release of 
pathogens. Our study also raises provocative questions about the potential role 
of schizotrophic endophytes in natural ecosystems.

BACKGROUND: CHDs are one of the most frequent congenital malformations, 
affecting one in hundred live births. In total, 70% will require treatment in 
the first year of life, but over 90% of cases in low- and middle-income 
countries receive no treatment or suboptimal treatment. As a result, CHDs are 
responsible for 66% of preventable deaths due to congenital malformations in 
low- and middle-income countries. This study examines the unmet need of 
congenital cardiac care around the world based on the global burden of disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CHD morbidity and mortality data for 2006, 2011, and 2016 
were collected from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Global 
Burden of Disease Results Tool and analysed longitudinally to assess trends in 
excess morbidity and mortality.
RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2016, a 20.7% reduction in excess disability-adjusted 
life years and 20.6% reduction in excess deaths due to CHDs were observed for 
children under 15. In 2016, excess global morbidity and mortality due to CHDs 
remained high with 14,788,418.7 disability-adjusted life years and 171,761.8 
paediatric deaths, respectively. In total, 90.2% of disability-adjusted life 
years and 91.2% of deaths were considered excess.
CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the unmet need of congenital cardiac care 
around the world. Progress has been made to reduce morbidity and mortality due 
to CHDs but remains high and largely treatable around the world. Limited 
academic attention for global paediatric cardiac care magnifies the lack of 
progress in this area.

Rationale, aim & objective: The goal of this study was to examine the health and 
economic impacts related to increased utilization of the Duke Smoking Cessation 
Program resulting from the addition of two relatively new referral 
methods - Best Practice Advisory and Population Outreach. Materials & methods: 
In a companion paper 'Comparison of Referral Methods into a Smoking Cessation 
Program', we report results from a retrospective, observational, comparative 
effectiveness study comparing the impact of three referral methods - Traditional 
Referral, Best Practice Advisory and Population Outreach on utilization of the 
Duke Smoking Cessation Program. In this paper we take the next step in this 
comparative assessment by developing a Markov model to estimate the improvement 
in health and economic outcomes when two referral methods - Best Practice 
Advisory and Population Outreach - are added to Traditional Referral. Data used 
in this analysis were collected from Duke Primary Care and Disadvantaged Care 
clinics over a 1-year period (1 October 2017-30 September 2018). Results: The 
addition of two new referral methods - Best Practice Advisory and Population 
Outreach - to Traditional Referral increased the utilization of the Duke Smoking 
Cessation Program in Primary Care clinics from 129 to 329 smokers and in 
Disadvantaged Care clinics from 206 to 401 smokers. The addition of these 
referral methods was estimated to result in 967 life-years gained, 408 
discounted quality-adjusted life-years saved and total discounted lifetime 
direct healthcare cost savings of US$46,376,285. Conclusion: Health systems may 
achieve increased patient health and decreased healthcare costs by adding Best 
Practice Advisory and Population Outreach strategies to refer patients to 
smoking cessation services.

Challenges exist in respect of people with intellectual disabilities who, with 
the increasing life expectancy, have a growing risk of age-related degenerative 
conditions. Changes in bone health are associated with increasing age and the 
bone health of people who have intellectual disabilities is well documented in 
the literature as being poor in comparison to the general population. A heel 
scan clinic was set up in an intellectual disability service as a service 
improvement initiative. There were 12 females and 17 males scanned using a heel 
scanner. Only 3 (10.3%) people with intellectual disabilities were in the normal 
bone mineral density (BMD) range. Peripheral BMD screening for people has been 
shown to provide important information about the bone health of people with 
intellectual disabilities which has prompted further treatment by general 
practitioners and has the potential to provide an accessible way to obtain 
information on the bone health of people with intellectual disabilities.

IMPORTANCE: Studies on the use of and adherence to secondary prevention 
therapies in patients with premature and extremely premature atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare aspirin use, any statin use, high-intensity 
statin use, and statin adherence among patients with premature or extremely 
premature ASCVD compared with patients with nonpremature ASCVD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cross-sectional study used 
the clinical and administrative data sets of the US Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) to identify adult patients with at least 1 primary care visit in 
the VA health care system between October 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015. The 
study cohort comprised patients with ASCVD (ischemic heart disease, peripheral 
arterial disease, or ischemic cerebrovascular disease) who were enrolled in the 
Veterans With Premature Atherosclerosis (VITAL) registry. Patients with missing 
data for date of birth or sex and those with limited life expectancy were 
excluded. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2019, to January 1, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Premature (the first ASCVD event occurred at age <55 years for men 
and age <65 years for women) vs nonpremature (the first ASCVD event occurred at 
age ≥55 years for men or age ≥65 years for women) ASCVD and extremely premature 
(the first ASCVD event occurred at age <40 years) vs nonpremature ASCVD.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were aspirin use, any statin 
use, high-intensity statin use, and statin adherence (measured by proportion of 
days covered [PDC] ≥0.8).
RESULTS: Of the 1 248 158 patients identified, 135 703 (10.9%) had premature 
ASCVD (mean [SD] age, 49.6 [5.8] years; 116 739 men [86.0%]), 1 112 455 (89.1%) 
had nonpremature ASCVD (mean [SD] age, 69.6 [8.9] years; 1 104 318 men [99.3%]), 
and 7716 (0.6%) had extremely premature ASCVD (mean [SD] age, 34.2 [4.3] years; 
6576 men [85.2%]). Patients with premature ASCVD vs those with nonpremature 
ASCVD had lower rates of aspirin use (96 468 [71.1%] vs 860 726 [77.4%]; 
P < .001) and any statin use (98 908 [72.9%] vs 894 931 [80.5%]; P < .001); had 
a statin PDC of 0.8 or higher (57 306 [57.9%] vs 644 357 [72.0%]; P < .001); and 
a higher rate of high-intensity statin use (49 354 [36.4%] vs 332 820 [29.9%]; 
P < .001). Similarly, patients with extremely premature ASCVD were less likely 
to use aspirin (odds ratio [OR], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.26-0.29), any statin (OR, 0.25; 
95% CI, 0.24-0.27), or high-intensity statin (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74-0.82) and 
to be statin adherent (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.41-0.47).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, patients with premature or extremely 
premature ASCVD appeared to be less likely to use aspirin or statins and to 
adhere to statin therapy. This finding warrants further investigation into 
premature ASCVD and initiatives, including clinician and patient education, to 
better understand and mitigate the disparities in medication use and adherence.

Author information:
(1)UCD School of Mathematics & Statistics, Belfield, Dublin 4.

Period Life expectancies for the Irish population are projected and published by 
the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the United Nations (UN). This article 
estimates cohort life expectancies at birth in Ireland over the remainder of the 
21st century together with 80% and 95% prediction intervals consistent with 
these official estimates. We report that a female born in Ireland in calendar 
year 2020 can be expected to live to 92.6 years with a 95% prediction interval 
around this estimate of 86.8 years to 97.3 years. For males born in 2020, the 
central estimate is 90 years with 95% prediction interval of 83.9 years to 95.2 
years. The probability that cohort life expectancies at birth will reach 100 
years before the calendar year 2100 is less than 10% for females and less than 
2.5% for males.

A comparison of health indicators and social determinants of health between 
Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

Rosenthal FS(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Health Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA.

Despite the proximity and interconnections between Israel and the Occupied 
Palestinian Territories (oPt), great disparities persist in health status 
between these two regions. This disparity is seen in infant, child and maternal 
mortality, life expectancy, mortality rates for leading causes of death and 
measures of mental well-being. This paper compares health indicators between oPt 
and Israel and examines the social determinants of health that may be 
responsible for differences between them. Data on health indicators were 
obtained from publicly available publications or websites of the World Health 
Organization and The World Bank, as well as the database of the Global Burden of 
Disease Project of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. Data on the 
social determinants of health were obtained from publications and websites of 
the United Nations, the World Bank, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 
Palestinian and Israeli government reports, reports from non-governmental 
organisations, peer-reviewed studies and news articles. The health disparities 
are due to a complex mix of factors involving economic conditions, food 
insecurity, environmental exposures, psychological trauma and stress, and access 
to health services, most of which can be related directly or indirectly to the 
Israeli military occupation of oPt.

OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) has shown efficacy and 
safety in the colorectum. The aim of this analysis was to investigate whether 
EFTR is cost-effective in comparison with surgical and endoscopic treatment 
alternatives.
DESIGN: Real data from the study cohort of the prospective, single-arm WALL 
RESECT study were used. A simulated comparison arm was created based on a survey 
that included suggested treatment alternatives to EFTR of the respective 
lesions. Treatment costs and reimbursement were calculated in euro according to 
the coding rules of 2017 and 2019 (EFTR). R0 resection rate was used as a 
measure of effectiveness. To assess cost-effectiveness, the average 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) were determined. Calculations were made both from the perspective of the 
care provider as well as of the payer.
RESULTS: The cost per case was €2852.20 for the EFTR group, €1712 for the 
standard endoscopic resection (SER) group, €8895 for the surgical resection 
group and €5828 for the pooled alternative treatment to EFTR. From the 
perspective of the care provider, the ACER (mean cost per R0 resection) was 
€3708.98 for EFTR, €3115.10 for SER, €8924.05 for surgical treatment and 
€7169.30 for all pooled and weighted alternatives to EFTR. The ICER (additional 
cost per R0 resection compared with EFTR) was €5196.47 for SER, €26 533.13 for 
surgical resection and €67 768.62 for the pooled rate of alternatives. Results 
from the perspective of the payer were similar.
CONCLUSION: EFTR is cost-effective in comparison with surgical and endoscopic 
treatment alternatives in the colorectum.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of management strategies for 
patients presenting with chest pain and suspected coronary heart disease (CHD): 
(1) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR); (2) myocardial perfusion 
scintigraphy (MPS); and (3) UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) guideline-guided care.
METHODS: Using UK data for 1202 patients from the Clinical Evaluation of 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Coronary Heart Disease 2 trial, we conducted an 
economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of CMR, MPS and NICE 
guidelines. Health outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and costs reflected UK pound sterling in 2016-2017. Cost-effectiveness 
results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental 
net health benefits overall and for low, medium and high pretest likelihood of 
CHD subgroups.
RESULTS: CMR had the highest estimated QALY gain overall (2.21 (95% credible 
interval 2.15, 2.26) compared with 2.07 (1.92, 2.20) for NICE and 2.11 (2.01, 
2.22) for MPS) and incurred comparable costs (overall £1625 (£1431, £1824) 
compared with £1753 (£1473, £2032) for NICE and £1768 (£1572, £1989) for MPS). 
Overall, CMR was the cost-effective strategy, being the dominant strategy (more 
effective, less costly) with incremental net health benefits per patient of 
0.146 QALYs (-0.18, 0.406) compared with NICE guidelines at a cost-effectiveness 
threshold of £15 000 per QALY (93% probability of cost-effectiveness). Results 
were similar in the pretest likelihood subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: CMR-guided care is cost-effective overall and across all pretest 
likelihood subgroups, compared with MPS and NICE guidelines.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
has improved considerably with the use of mechanical ventilation to manage 
respiratory insufficiency. The choice between continuous noninvasive ventilation 
(NIV) and invasive ventilation is guided both by local logistical considerations 
and by clinical considerations, but the choice depends largely on patient 
preference. It is important to know the effects of ventilatory dependence and 
the method used (ie, continuous NIV or invasive ventilation) on subjects' 
quality of life.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional prospective survey of 192 subjects with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy using mechanical ventilation in France. Subjects 
were grouped and compared according to dependence on mechanical ventilation and 
the ventilation methods used.
RESULTS: Regardless of the mechanical ventilation method, subjects with 
gastrostomy tubes reported more frequent emergency consultations for digestive 
problems (22.5% vs 4.6%, P = .001). Subjects with invasive ventilation reported 
more insomnia than those with continuous NIV (23.8% vs 8.5%, P = .04). The 
latter reported more ineffective cough than the invasive ventilation group 
(72.3% vs 49.2%, P = .02). Overall, the subjects in our sample were satisfied 
with their medical care, regardless of dependence level or ventilation type. 
More specifically, 86.1% of subjects with intermittent NIV and 83.6% of 
ventilator-dependent subjects were satisfied.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous and invasive mechanical ventilation did not affect the 
perception of quality of life for our subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 
apart from more insomnia, which can be explained by the fact that they required 
frequent repositioning in bed. Different pressure-relief mattresses should be 
tested and compared to prevent the development of pressure ulcers, which may 
improve the sleep patterns of these patients.

Declines in period life expectancy at birth (PLEB) provide intuitive indicators 
of the impact of a cause of death on the individual lifespan. Derived under the 
assumption that future mortality conditions will remain indefinitely those 
observed during a reference period, however, the intuitive interpretation of a 
PLEB becomes problematic when that period conditions reflect a temporary 
mortality "shock", resulting from a natural disaster or the diffusion of a new 
epidemic in the population for instance. Rather than to make assumptions about 
future mortality, I propose measuring the difference between a period average 
age at death and the average expected age at death of the same individuals 
(death cohort): the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL). For fine-grained tracking 
of the mortality impact of an epidemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to 
MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. For illustration, quarterly MUL 
values in 2020 are derived from estimates of COVID-19 deaths in 159 national 
populations and 122 sub-national populations in Italy, Mexico, Spain and the US. 
The highest quarterly values in national populations are obtained for Ecuador 
(5.12 years, second quarter) and Peru (4.56 years, third quarter) and, in 
sub-national populations, for New York (5.52 years), New Jersey (5.56 years, 
second quarter) and Baja California (5.19 years, fourth quarter). Using a 
seven-day rolling window, the empirical shortcut suggests the MUL peaked at 9.12 
years in Madrid, 9.20 years in New York, and 9.15 years in Baja California, and 
in Guayas (Ecuador) it even reached 12.6 years for the entire month of April. 
Based on reported COVID-19 deaths that might substantially underestimate overall 
mortality change in affected populations, these results nonetheless illustrate 
how the MUL tracks the mortality impact of the pandemic, or any mortality shock, 
retaining the intuitive metric of differences in PLEB, without their problematic 
underlying assumptions.

BACKGROUND: Air pollution is an important public health concern in China, with 
high levels of exposure to both ambient and household air pollution. To inform 
action at provincial levels in China, we estimated the exposure to air pollution 
and its effect on deaths, disease burden, and loss of life expectancy across all 
provinces in China from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: In all 33 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and special 
administrative regions in China, we estimated exposure to air pollution, 
including ambient particulate matter pollution (defined as the annual gridded 
concentration of PM2·5), household air pollution (defined as the percentage of 
households using solid cooking fuels and the corresponding exposure to PM2·5), 
and ozone pollution (defined as average gridded ozone concentrations). We used 
the methods of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2017 to estimate deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable 
to air pollution, and what the life expectancy would have been if air pollution 
levels had been less than the minimum level causing health loss.
FINDINGS: The average annual population-weighted PM2·5 exposure in China was 
52·7 μg/m3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 41·0-62·8) in 2017, which is 9% lower 
than in 1990 (57·8 μg/m3, 45·0-67·0). We estimated that 1·24 million (95% UI 
1·08-1·40) deaths in China were attributable to air pollution in 2017, including 
851 660 (712 002-990 271) from ambient PM2·5 pollution, 271 089 
(209 882-346 561) from household air pollution from solid fuels, and 178 187 
(67 650-286 229) from ambient ozone pollution. The age-standardised DALY rate 
attributable to air pollution was 1513·1 per 100 000 in China in 2017, and was 
higher in males (1839·8 per 100 000) than in females (1198·3 per 100 000). The 
age-standardised death rate attributable to air pollution decreased by 60·6% 
(55·7-63·7) for China overall between 1990 and 2017, driven by an 85·4% 
(83·2-87·3) decline in household air pollution and a 12·0% (1·4-22·1) decline in 
ambient PM2·5 pollution. 40·0% of DALYs for COPD were attributable to air 
pollution, as were 35·6% of DALYs for lower respiratory infections, 26·1% for 
diabetes, 25·8% for lung cancer, 19·5% for ischaemic heart disease, and 12·8% 
for stroke. We estimated that if the air pollution level in China was below the 
minimum causing health loss, the average life expectancy would have been 1·25 
years greater. The DALY rate per 100 000 attributable to air pollution varied 
across provinces, ranging from 482·3 (371·1-604·1) in Hong Kong to 1725·6 
(720·4-2653·1) in Xinjiang for ambient pollution, and from 18·7 (9·1-34·0) in 
Shanghai to 1804·5 (1339·5-2270·1) in Tibet for household pollution. Although 
the overall mortality attributable to air pollution decreased in China between 
1990 and 2017, 12 provinces showed an increasing trend during the past 27 years.
INTERPRETATION: Pollution from ambient PM2·5 and household burning of solid 
fuels decreased markedly in recent years in China, after extensive efforts to 
control emissions. However, PM2·5 concentrations still exceed the WHO Air 
Quality Guideline for the entire population of China, with 81% living in regions 
exceeding the WHO Interim Target 1, and air pollution remains an important risk 
factor. Sustainable development policies should be implemented and enforced to 
reduce the impact of air pollution on long-term economic development and 
population health.

BACKGROUND: Insulin shares a limited physiological concentration range with 
other endocrine hormones. Not only too low, but also too high systemic insulin 
levels are detrimental for body functions.
MAIN BODY: The physiological function and clinical relevance of insulin are 
usually seen in association with its role in maintaining glucose homeostasis. 
However, insulin is an anabolic hormone which stimulates a large number of 
cellular responses. Not only too low, but also excess insulin concentrations are 
detrimental to the physiological balance. Although the glucoregulatory activity 
of insulin is mitigated during hyperinsulinemia by dampening the efficiency of 
insulin signaling ("insulin resistance"), this is not the case for most other 
hormonal actions of insulin, including the promotion of protein synthesis, de 
novo lipogenesis, and cell proliferation; the inhibition of lipolysis, of 
autophagy-dependent cellular turnover, and of nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 
(Nrf2)-dependent antioxidative; and other defense mechanisms. Hence, there is no 
general insulin resistance but selective impairment of insulin signaling which 
causes less glucose uptake from the blood and reduced activation of endothelial 
NO synthase (eNOS). Because of the largely unrestricted insulin signaling, 
hyperinsulinemia increases the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and 
cardiovascular disease and decreases health span and life expectancy. In 
epidemiological studies, high-dose insulin therapy is associated with an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Randomized controlled trials of 
insulin treatment did not observe any effect on disease risk, but these trials 
only studied low insulin doses up to 40 IU/day. Proof for a causal link between 
elevated insulin levels and cardiovascular disease risk comes from Mendelian 
randomization studies comparing individuals with genetically controlled low or 
high insulin production.
CONCLUSIONS: The detrimental actions of prolonged high insulin concentrations, 
seen also in cell culture, argue in favor of a lifestyle that limits circadian 
insulin levels. The health risks associated with hyperinsulinemia may have 
implications for treatment regimens used in type 2 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: Though estimates of longevity are available by states, age, sex and 
place of residence in India, disaggregated estimates by social and economic 
groups are limited. This study estimates the life expectancy at birth and 
premature mortality by caste, religion and regions of India.
DESIGN: This study primarily used cross-sectional data from the National Family 
Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015-2016 and the Sample Registration System (SRS), 
2011-2015. The NFHS-4 is the largest ever demographic and health survey covering 
601 509 households and 811 808 individuals across all states and union 
territories in India.
MEASURES: The abridged life table is constructed to estimate the life expectancy 
at birth, adult mortality (45q15) and premature mortality (70q0) by caste, 
religion and region.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 63.1 years (95% CI 62.60 
-63.64) for scheduled castes (SC), 64.0 years (95% CI 63.25 - 64.88) for 
scheduled tribes (ST), 65.1 years (95% CI 64.69 - 65.42) for other backward 
classes (OBC) and 68.0 years (95% CI 67.44 - 68.45) for others. The life 
expectancy at birth was higher among o Christians 68.1 years (95% CI 66.44 - 
69.60) than Muslims 66.0 years (95% CI 65.29 - 66.54) and Hindus 65.0 years (95% 
CI 64.74 -65.22). Life expectancy at birth was higher among females than among 
males across social groups in India. Premature mortality was higher among SC 
(0.382), followed by ST (0.381), OBC (0.344) and others (0.301). The regional 
variation in life expectancy by age and sex is large.
CONCLUSION: In India, social and religious differentials in life expectancy by 
sex are modest and need to be investigated among poor and rich within these 
groups. Premature mortality and adult mortality are also high across social and 
religious groups.

Primary cilia are generated through the extension of the microtubule-based 
axoneme. Centrosomal protein 104 (CEP104) localizes to the tip of the elongating 
axoneme, and CEP104 mutations are linked to a ciliopathy, Joubert syndrome. 
Thus, CEP104 has been implicated in ciliogenesis. However, the mechanism by 
which CEP104 regulates ciliogenesis remains elusive. We report here that CEP104 
is critical for cilium elongation but not for initiating ciliogenesis. We also 
demonstrated that the tumor-overexpressed gene (TOG) domain of CEP104 exhibits 
microtubule-polymerizing activity and that this activity is essential for the 
cilium-elongating activity of CEP104. Knockdown/rescue experiments showed that 
the N-terminal jelly-roll (JR) fold partially contributes to cilium-elongating 
activity of CEP104, but neither the zinc-finger region nor the SXIP motif is 
required for this activity. CEP104 binds to a centriole-capping protein, CP110, 
through the zinc-finger region and to a microtubule plus-end-binding protein, 
EB1, through the SXIP motif, indicating that the binding of CP110 and EB1 is 
dispensable for the cilium-elongating activity of CEP104. Moreover, CEP104 
depletion does not affect CP110 removal from the mother centriole, which 
suggests that CEP104 functions after the removal of CP110. Last, we also showed 
that CEP104 is required for the ciliary entry of Smoothened and export of GPR161 
upon Hedgehog signal activation and that the TOG domain plays a critical role in 
this activity. Our results define the roles of the individual domains of CEP104 
in its functions in cilium elongation and Hedgehog signaling and should enhance 
our understanding of the mechanism underlying CEP104 mutation-associated 
ciliopathies.

To put estimates of COVID-19 mortality into perspective, we estimate 
age-specific mortality for an epidemic claiming for illustrative purposes 1 
million US lives, with results approximately scalable over a broad range of 
deaths. We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 2.94 y) and 
remaining life years (11.7 y per death). Avoiding 1.75 million deaths or 20.5 
trillion person years of life lost would be valued at $10.2 to $17.5 trillion. 
The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality in other countries are quite similar and 
increase at rates close to each country's rate for all-cause mortality. The 
scenario of 1 million COVID-19 deaths is similar in scale to that of the 
decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller 
than that of the Spanish flu of 1918. Unlike HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics, the 
COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in a period of months rather than spread out 
over decades.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare providers use a life expectancy of at least 5 to 10 years 
in shared clinical decision-making with older adults about cancer screening, 
major surgeries, and disease prevention interventions. At present, few 
prognostic indexes predict long-term mortality beyond 10 years or are suited for 
use in primary care settings.
OBJECTIVE: We developed and validated an 8-item multidimensional index 
predicting 11-year mortality for use in primary care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using data from the Singapore Longitudinal 
Ageing Studies (SLAS), we developed a Primary Care Prognostic (PCP) Index for 
predicting 11-year mortality risk in a development cohort (n = 1550) and 
validated it in a geographically different cohort (n = 928).
MAIN MEASURES: The PCP Index was derived from eight indicators (body mass loss, 
weakness, slow gait, comorbidity, polypharmacy, IADL/BADL dependency, low 
albumin, low total cholesterol, out of 25 candidate indicators) using stepwise 
Cox proportional hazard models.
KEY RESULTS: In the developmental cohort, the mortality hazard ratio increased 
by 53% per PCP point score increase, independent of age and sex. Across risk 
categories, absolute risks of mortality increased from 5% (score 0) to 67.9% 
(scores 7-9), with area under curve (AUC = 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.80)). The PCP 
Index also predicted mortality in the validation cohort, with AUC = 0.70 (95% CI 
0.64-0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: The PCP Index using simple clinical assessments and point scoring 
is a potentially useful prognostic tool for predicting long-term mortality and 
is well suited for risk stratification and shared clinical decision-making with 
older adults in primary care.
