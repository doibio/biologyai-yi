OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an occupational therapy-led 
lifestyle approach to treating panic disorder in primary care compared with 
routine general practitioner's (GP) care. The burden of mental health disorders 
is considerable. Cost-effective interventions are necessary to alleviate some of 
these burdens. Habitual lifestyle behaviours influence mood, although to date 
mainly single lifestyle factor trials have been conducted to examine the effects 
on anxiety.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside an unblinded pragmatic 
randomised controlled trial with assessment at 5 and 10 months. Costs and 
consequences, as measured by the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs), were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The occupational therapy-led lifestyle intervention was more costly 
than routine GP care at both 5 and 10 months. Significant outcome improvements 
were evident at 5 months when using the BAI, although these were not maintained 
at 10 months. Small differences in mean QALYs were found. The estimated ICER was 
36 pounds per BAI improvement for 5 months and 39 pounds for 10 months, and 
18,905 pounds per QALY gained for 5 months and 8,283 pounds for 10 months.
CONCLUSIONS: If the maximum willingness to pay per additional QALY is 30,000 
pounds, then there is an 86% chance that a lifestyle intervention may be 
considered to be value-for-money over 10 months.

INTRODUCTION: Pyogenic ventriculitis is an uncommon but often severe 
intracranial infection.
METHODS: Case report with illustrative CT and MRI imaging.
RESULTS: A 49-year-old man presented with an intraparenchymal hematoma with 
extension of blood into the ventricles. The persistence of intraventricular 
blood necessitated long term placement of an external ventricular drain. On day 
23 after admission, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the brain showed slight 
hydrocephalus, irregular debris in the dependent part of the occipital horns and 
periventricular hypodensities. An MRI scan confirmed the characteristic 
hallmarks of pyogenic ventriculitis on the T2-weighted, Fluid Attenuated 
Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced 
T1-weighted images.
CONCLUSION: Neuroimaging is crucial in clearly depicting pyogenic ventriculitis. 
A contrast-enhanced CT scan, but especially MR imaging, is an ideal tool to 
reliably diagnose this life-threatening cerebral infection.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy results in a higher number of 
patients with an advanced age over 80 years requiring abdominal aortic aneurysm 
therapy. The aim of this study was to review the outcome of octogenarians 
undergoing endovascular treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2004 and March 2008 25 patients (24 males, 
one female), with a mean age of 83 +/- 2.6 years (range: 80-91 years) underwent 
elective endovascular treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms. The average 
preoperative aneurysm diameter was 57 +/- 9.8 mm (range: 40-80 mm). All 
procedures were carried out in the angiography suite under general anesthesia.
RESULTS: Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was technically 
successful in all patients. There was one perioperative death due to an 
aneurysm-related complication. The perioperative (30 days) mortality rate was 4 
%. Intensive care unit admission was required in five patients. The in-hospital 
morbidity rate was 20 %. Mean follow-up time was 18.7 +/- 14 months (range: 2 to 
47 months). Two patients died from unrelated causes. There were no device- or 
aneurysm-related deaths. A patient with a type I A endoleak underwent correction 
by additional stent-graft placement four weeks after initial placement.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in octogenarians is a 
valuable alternative to open aortic repair and can be performed safely and 
successfully. We strongly recommend the endovascular treatment for patients over 
80 years of age with an appropriate size of aortic aneurysm.

The effect of migraine prophylaxis on migraine-related resource use and 
productivity.

Valencia, 46010 Valencia, Spain. jlaineza@meditex.es

In the US, it is estimated that up to 10% of men and 25% of women, particularly 
those aged 25-55 years, experience debilitating migraines, such that the 
condition presents an enormous economic burden for patients, health systems, 
employers and society. Migraine headache is a particularly prevalent condition 
associated with major reductions in patients' quality of life. From a payer 
perspective, the implementation of relevant programmes of migraine prophylaxis 
is highly desirable. Consistent evidence exists, from several randomized, 
controlled studies, of the efficacy of amitriptyline, divalproex sodium, 
propranolol, timolol and topiramate in migraine prophylaxis. Considering 
resource utilization, various studies suggest that migraine prophylaxis with 
antiepileptics, antidepressants, beta-blockers or calcium channel antagonists 
markedly reduces triptan use and visits to physician offices and emergency 
departments (EDs), without compromising quality of care or treatment outcomes. 
Over recent years, the effects of topiramate in reducing resource utilization in 
patients with migraine have been relatively widely studied. In US claims 
database analyses involving >4000 patients with migraine, topiramate 
significantly reduced triptan use by up to 20% in the 12-month period after 
starting treatment. Reductions were also noted in the numbers of ED visits, 
diagnostic procedures, hospital admissions and migraine-related hospitalization 
days. These long-term benefits of topiramate manifested without any increase in 
overall headache-related costs. Furthermore, in detailed modelling analyses 
based on UK and US data, topiramate-induced savings in acute medical services 
were estimated to offset about one-quarter of the monthly per patient cost of 
the topiramate regimen, which was shown to be a dominant cost-effective 
intervention relative to no preventive therapy: cost-effectiveness ratios were 
calculated as pound 5728 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) [2005 costings] 
and $US10 888 per QALY (2002 costings), respectively. Overall, there is a need 
to improve quality of care in migraine, and prophylactic therapy appears to be 
an effective option, particularly with respect to decreasing resource use and 
improving productivity. For both health-plan payers and employers, topiramate 
appears to be a cost-effective intervention for preventing migraine.

10 years of tension on chromatin: results from single molecule force 
spectroscopy.

Chien FT(1), van Noort J.

The compact, yet dynamic organization of chromatin plays an essential role in 
regulating gene expression. Although the static structure of chromatin fibers 
has been studied extensively, the controversy about the higher order folding 
remains. In the past ten years a number of studies have addressed chromatin 
folding with single molecule force spectroscopy. By manipulating chromatin 
fibers individually, the mechanical properties of the fibers were quantified 
with piconewton and nanometer accuracy. Here, we review the results of force 
induced chromatin unfolding and compare the differences between experimental 
conditions and single molecule manipulation techniques like force and position 
clamps. From these studies, five major features appeared upon forced extension 
of chromatin fibers: the elastic stretching of chromatin's higher order 
structure, the breaking of internucleosomal contacts, unwrapping of the first 
turn of DNA, unwrapping of the second turn of DNA, and the dissociation of 
histone octamers. These events occur sequentially at the increasing force. 
Resolving force induced structural changes of chromatin fibers at the single 
molecule level will help to provide a physical understanding of processes 
involving chromatin that occur in vivo and will reveal the mechanical 
constraints that are relevant for processing and maintenance of DNA in 
eukaryotes.

Segmental hemangioma of infancy complicated by life-threatening arterial bleed.

Connelly EA(1), Viera M, Price C, Waner M.

Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common benign vascular tumors of 
childhood. IH of "segmental" morphology, are clusters of hemangiomas with a 
configuration involving a broad anatomic territory of skin. They are the least 
common of all types and generally larger than regular hemangiomas, 
morphologically characterized as plaque-like lesions. Head and neck segmental 
hemangiomas have a higher risk of causing life-threatening complications and of 
having associated structural anomalies, i.e., PHACES syndrome (Posterior fossa 
malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, coartation of the aorta and 
other cardiac defects, eye abnormalities and sternal clefting or supra abdominal 
raphe). We present a patient with a segmental IH over the right anterior neck 
complicated by ulceration and life threatening arterial bleeding. Although 
segmental hemangiomas of head and neck have high incidence of ulceration, 
fortunately life threatening bleeding events are rare with only 7 previously 
recorded cases. We recommend that large, neck IH be followed closely for 
evidence of ulceration and that MRI/MRA be performed to adequately assess their 
vascular supply. Direct extension of the ulceration into arterial vessels is a 
possibility and can lead to severe bleeding. Life-threatening bleeding is an 
unusual complication of IH and may represents a surgical emergency. In such 
cases we recommend a multidisciplinary approach to their treatment.

What is the impact of missing Indigenous status on mortality estimates? An 
assessment using record linkage in Western Australia.

Author information:
(1)Epidemiology Branch, Department of Health, Western Australia.

BACKGROUND: The analysis aimed to assess the Indigenous status of an increasing 
number of deaths not coded with a useable Indigenous status from 1997 to 2002 
and its impact on reported recent gains in Indigenous mortality.
METHODS: The Indigenous status of WA death records with a missing Indigenous 
status was determined based upon data linkage to three other data sources 
(Hospital Morbidity Database System, Mental Health Information System and 
Midwives Notification System).
RESULTS: Overall, the majority of un-coded cases were assigned an Indigenous 
status, with 5.9% identified as Indigenous from the M1 series and 7.5% from the 
M2 series. The significant increase in Indigenous male LE of 5.4 years from 1997 
to 2002 decreased to 4.0 and 3.6 years using the M1 and M2 series, respectively, 
but remained significant. For Indigenous females, the non-significant increase 
in LE of 1.8 years from 1997 to 2002 decreased to 1.0 and 0.6 years. 
Furthermore, annual all-cause mortality rates were higher than in the original 
data for both genders, but the significant decline for males remained.
CONCLUSION: Through data linkage, the increasing proportion of deaths not coded 
with a useable Indigenous status was shown to impact on Indigenous mortality 
statistics in Western Australia leading to an overestimate of improvements in 
life expectancy. Greater attention needs to be given to better identification 
and recording of Indigenous identifiers if real improvements in health status 
are to be demonstrated. A system that captures an individual's Indigenous status 
once and is reflected in all health and administrative data systems needs 
consideration within Australia.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence, prevalence, 
survival, case fatality and mortality for Māori, in order to support service 
planning and resource allocation.
METHODS: Incidence was defined as first occurrence of a major coronary event, 
i.e. the sum of first CHD hospital admissions and out-of-hospital CHD deaths in 
people without a hospital admission for CHD in the preceding five years. Data 
for the years 2000-02 were sourced from the New Zealand Health Information 
Service and record linkage was carried out using a unique national identifier, 
the national health index.
RESULTS: Compared to the non-Māori population, Māori had both elevated CHD 
incidence and higher case fatality. Median age at onset of CHD was younger for 
Māori, reflecting both higher age specific risks and younger population age 
structure. The lifetable risk of CHD for Māori was estimated at 37% (males) and 
34% (females), only moderately higher than the corresponding estimates for the 
non-Māori population, despite higher Māori CHD incidence. This reflects the 
offsetting effect of the higher 'other cause' mortality experienced by Māori. 
Median duration of survival with CHD was similar to that of the non-Māori 
population for Māori males but longer for Māori females, which is most likely 
related to the earlier age of onset.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has generated consistent estimates of CHD incidence, 
prevalence, survival, case fatality and mortality for Māori in 2000-02. The 
inequality identified in CHD incidence calls for a renewed effort in primary 
prevention. The inequality in CHD case fatality calls for improvement in access 
for Māori to secondary care services.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of four different lifestyle 
interventions for knee pain.
DESIGN: Cost utility analysis of randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Five general practices in the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS: 389 adults aged > or = 45 with self reported knee pain and body 
mass index (BMI) > or = 28.
INTERVENTIONS: Dietary intervention plus quadriceps strengthening exercises, 
dietary intervention, quadriceps strengthening exercises, and leaflet provision. 
Participants received home visits over a two year period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained over two years from a health service perspective.
RESULTS: Advice leaflet was associated with a mean change in cost of -31 pounds 
sterling, and a mean QALY gain of 0.085. Both strengthening exercises and 
dietary intervention were more effective (0.090 and 0.133 mean QALY gain, 
respectively) but were not cost effective. Dietary intervention plus 
strengthening exercises had a mean cost of 647 pounds sterling and a mean QALY 
gain of 0.147 and was estimated to have an incremental cost of 10,469 pounds 
sterling per QALY gain (relative to leaflet provision), and a 23.1% probability 
of being cost effective at a 20,000 pounds sterling/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: Dietary intervention plus strengthening exercises was estimated to 
be cost effective for individuals with knee pain, but with a large level of 
uncertainty.

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy has led to a significant 
decline in the incidence of mortality and progression to AIDS in HIV-infection. 
With increased life expectancy, HIV-infected individuals are being affected by 
cardiovascular disease. Research studies have identified an increased prevalence 
of traditional coronary risk factors in HIV-infected patients. Additional 
investigations suggest that the virus itself may independently result in 
atherosclerosis. Further studies have linked the use of highly active 
antiretroviral therapy to the atherosclerotic processes. These findings suggest 
the need to reconsider HIV as one of the traditionally accepted risk factors for 
coronary artery disease, with treatment aimed at prevention of myocardial 
infarction.

BACKGROUND: Our objective was to analyse the cost effectiveness of computed 
tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer in terms of the cost per long-term 
survivor, which has not been evaluated to date.
METHODS: Estimations were computed based on data from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results registries covering years 1999-2003. The design 
framework of our model allowed for the incorporation of multiple values taken 
from the epidemiological and clinical literature to be utilised for cost inputs, 
scope of patients screened, diagnostic staging, and survival percentages applied 
separately to two cohorts: age 40-79 and 60-79 years. This enabled the analysis 
of over 1400 scenarios, each containing a unique set of input values, for which 
the estimated cost per 5-year survivor (CP5YS) was compared between the 
symptom-detected and proactive screening approaches.
RESULTS: Estimated CP5YS were higher for the symptom-detected approach in all 
729 scenarios analysed for the cohort ages 60-79 years, ranging from 
approximately $5800 to $116,700 increased cost per 5-year survivor (CP5YS). For 
the cohort ages 40-79 years, 75% of the 729 scenarios analysed showed increased 
CP5YS for the symptom-detected approach ranging from $5700 to $110,000 increased 
CP5YS. Total costs and total 5-year survivors were higher for the proactive 
screening method for all scenarios analysed across both cohorts with increases 
ranging from 50-256% and 98-309%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The predicted increase in long-term survival with CT screening and 
the potential for better utilisation of health-care dollars in terms of CP5YS, 
particularly when screening patients over the age of 60 years, are critically 
important considerations in directing effective future lung cancer management 
strategy.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a rare and severe autosomal 
dominant disorder caused by mutations in a tumour suppressor gene. This article 
reviews NF2 and its treatment with auditory brainstem implantation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The review is based on the authors' experience with the 
disease and literature identified through a non-systematic search of PubMed.
RESULTS: NF2 is caused by loss-of-normal function of the tumour suppressor 
protein merlin. Merlin normally suppresses cell growth and proliferation. The 
clinical picture is dominated by neurological symptoms, caused by multiple 
tumours - mainly schwannomas and meningeomas. The hallmark of the disease is 
development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas, and the most common presenting 
symptom in adults is progressive hearing loss. Presenile cataract, ocular 
motility disorders, peripheral neuropathy and skin tumours are other common 
findings. The majority of patients become deaf, many patients become severely 
disabled and life expectancy is reduced. The goal of management is conservation 
of function and maintenance of quality of life. Auditory brainstem implants 
stimulate the cochlear nucleus directly and provide substantial auditory 
benefits to patients with NF2.
INTERPRETATION: A multidisciplinary approach in specialty centres is 
recommended. Management by an experienced team reduces mortality and improves 
outcome after surgery. Auditory brainstem implantation is an important part of 
the hearing rehabilitation in these patients. Emerging knowledge of the 
molecular disease mechanisms offers hope for new therapeutic strategies.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare survival rates and marginal 
bone resorption of the Lifecore (LC) Restore Implant System with the benchmark 
Nobel Biocare (NB) MK II Implant System.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All implants were inserted by the same surgeon and all 
radiological analyses were performed by the same radiologist. Two hundred ninety 
LC implants were analyzed radiologically after 1 year and compared with the same 
number of NB implants serving as a historical reference group. After 5 years, 
200 LC implants could be compared with 224 NB implants. Each implant was 
monitored for exposed threads, as compared with the baseline registrations.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the two implant systems 
regarding survival rates (LC 100% and NB 99.2%). Considering the findings of 
this study, the two implant systems compared might be regarded as clones. 
Nevertheless, because of dissimilar onset of threads, about 1 mm more 
implant-retaining bone anchorage is gained with the Lifecore Restore Implants as 
compared with NB MK II Implants.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the assumption that >3 exposed NB threads correspond to >4 
exposed LC threads, significantly more bone loss (p < .01) could be demonstrated 
for the NB implants after 5 years. Thus, it may be justified to consider the 
differences in implant design to have a decisive clinical relevance.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists provide a clinically and economically 
efficient treatment option for psoriatic arthritis (PsA). PsA is a chronic 
inflammatory disease affecting the musculoskeletal system that, if untreated, 
can be disabling due to the progressive joint damage and the considerable impact 
on functional status and health-related quality of life. Therapies for PsA have 
been disappointing until recently. Traditional disease-modifying drugs are used 
to control symptoms, but there is no evidence that they slow the progression of 
the damage in peripheral joints. The introduction of the TNF-alpha-blocking 
agents has revolutionized the therapeutic management of PsA. These drugs lessen 
symptoms and signs of inflammation, enhance quality of life and functional 
capacity, and hinder the evolution of structural joint damage. TNF-alpha 
blockers are very expensive and not easily available to all patients, either 
depending on a national system or private insurance. Nevertheless, recent 
pharmacoeconomic studies have demonstrated that TNF-alpha blockers are 
cost-effective treatment options for the musculoskeletal and cutaneous 
manifestations of psoriatic disease.

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common genetic cause of familial 
Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its physiological and pathological functions 
are unknown. Therefore, we generated several independent Drosophila lines 
carrying WT or mutant human LRRK2 (mutations in kinase, COR or LRR domains, 
resp.). Ectopic expression of WT or mutant LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons caused 
their significant loss accompanied by complex age-dependent changes in locomotor 
activity. Overall, the ubiquitous expression of LRRK2 increased lifespan and 
fertility of the flies. However, these flies were more sensitive to rotenone. 
LRRK2 expression in the eye exacerbated retinal degeneration. Importantly, in 
double transgenic flies, various indices of the eye and dopaminergic survival 
were modified in a complex fashion by a concomitant expression of PINK1, DJ-1 or 
Parkin. This evidence suggests a genetic interaction between these PD-relevant 
genes.

BACKGROUND: The US Centres for Disease Control provides a widely used online 
user-friendly computational program, called SAMMEC (Smoking Attributable 
Mortality, Morbidity and Economic Costs) to produce estimates of tobacco-related 
mortality. However, the SAMMEC tool loses accuracy because it lacks flexibility 
in deciding which diseases enter into the calculations, has estimates of 
relative risk (RR) attributable to smoking based on old studies, and does not 
allow for the latency period that occurs between initial exposure and mortality.
METHODS: Smoking attributable mortality (SAM) due to active smoking in Israel 
was estimated with the approach used by SAMMEC taking into account past and 
present smoking prevalence (lag-times) as well as using new and expanded disease 
categories.
RESULTS: Around 50.3% of the increase from the un-lagged SAM estimate of 3859 
deaths to the final SAM estimate of 8664 deaths in 2003 is attributable to the 
introduction of lag times. More robust estimates of risk accounted for a further 
29.6% of the increase. While 21.2% is attributable to the inclusion of 
additional disease categories, only 1.5% was attributable to the widening of 
existing diseases categories.
CONCLUSION: This difference in estimates is attributable to expansion of the 
list of diseases included, updating the estimates of RR for smoking-attributable 
death, and the use of smoking prevalence from previous years to more accurately 
reflect the effect of tobacco use on disease occurrence. There is a need to 
establish an 'authority' to implement a multi-faceted intervention strategy to 
decrease the considerable burden from smoking in Israel.

The ladybird beetle, Stethorus gilvifrons, is a major predator of the red spider 
mite, Oligonychus coffeae, infesting tea. Biology, life table and predatory 
efficiency of S. gilvifrons were studied under laboratory conditions. Its 
average developmental period from egg to adult emergence was 19.2 days. After a 
mean pre-oviposition period of 5.3 days, each female laid an average of 149.3 
eggs. Adult females lived for 117.3 days and males for 41.5 days. The life table 
of the beetle was characterized by an intrinsic rate of increase (r) of 0.066 
day(-1), net reproductive rate (R (0)) of 72.2 eggs/female, gross reproduction 
rate (Sigmam ( x )) of 82.3 eggs/female, generation time (T) of 64.9 days, 
doubling time of 10.5 days and finite rate of increase (lambda) of 1.07 day(-1). 
Population dynamics of S. gilvifrons and its prey, O. coffeae, was monitored by 
sampling 25 tea leaves from each experimental block grown under the prevailing 
field conditions. Populations of S. gilvifrons reached a peak during January to 
March and had low incidence during June to November. Peaks in the populations of 
S. gilvifrons coincided with the abundance of O. coffeae in tea fields. Weather 
factors such as low temperature, high humidity and heavy rainfall adversely 
affected the populations of S. gilvifrons. The predatory efficiency of S. 
gilvifrons increased during the growth of larval instars. An adult female 
consumed 205.0 eggs, 92.2 larvae, 81.8 nymphs and 52.4 adult mites per day.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the key methodological issues in the construction of 
population-level EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D)/time trade-off (TTO) preference 
elicitation studies.
METHOD: This study involved three components. The first was to identify existing 
population-level EQ-5D TTO studies. The second was to illustrate and discuss the 
key areas of divergence between studies, including the international comparison 
of tariffs. The third was to portray the relative merits of each of the 
approaches and to compare the results of studies across countries.
RESULTS: While most articles report use of the protocol developed in the 
original UK study, we identified three key areas of divergence in the 
construction and analysis of surveys. These are the number of health states 
valued to determine the algorithm for estimating all health states, the approach 
to valuing states worse than immediate death, and the choice of algorithm. The 
evidence on international comparisons suggests differences between countries 
although it is difficult to disentangle differences in cultural attitudes with 
random error and differences as a result of methodological divergence.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in methods may obscure true differences in values 
between countries. Nevertheless, population-specific valuation sets for 
countries engaging in economic evaluation would better reflect cultural 
differences and are therefore more likely to accurately represent societal 
attitudes.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the disease burden of pneumococcal disease (PD), a 
major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in Argentina, and to draw a 
baseline against which the need for and effectiveness of vaccination with 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines might be measured.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate incidence and mortality 
rates of PD-meningitis (MEN), bacteremia/septicemia (BACT), pneumonia (PNEU), 
acute otitis media (AOM)-among a hypothetical, birth cohort of 750,000 Argentine 
infants born in 2006-2015. A systematic review of the literature was performed 
to select and incorporate input parameters. Life years and costs in 2006 US$ 
were expressed as both undiscounted and discounted.
RESULTS: The number of PD episodes estimated to occur over a 10-year period in 
the hypothetical birth cohort were: MEN, 225; BACT, 2841; PNEU, 2628; and AOM, 
2,066,719. Chronic sequelae of MEN could be expected to cause neurological 
damage in 43 children and severe hearing issues in 28. Results indicate that 
there would be 78 PD-related deaths in the cohort (29% due to MEN; 54%, BACT; 
and 17%, PNEU). The undiscounted life-expectancy for individuals in the birth 
cohort was estimated to be 72.4 years (29.0 years discounted). Mean, 
undiscounted, lifetime costs attributed to PD for each child of the cohort 
totaled US$167 (US$151 discounted), imposing a total, cohort cost-burden of more 
than US$126 million (US$113 million discounted).
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that PD imposes a significant health and economic 
burden on the Argentine population. This information is essential for assessing 
the potential health and economic impact of introducing pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine into the national immunization schedule.

The challenges of organising cervical screening programmes in the 15 old member 
states of the European Union.

Cervical cancer incidence and mortality can be reduced substantially by 
organised cytological screening at 3 to 5 year intervals, as was demonstrated in 
the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and parts of Italy. 
Opportunistic screening, often proposed at yearly schedules, has also reduced 
the burden of cervical cancer in some, but not all, of the other old member 
states (belonging to the European Union since 1995) but at a cost that is 
several times greater. Well organised screening programmes have the potential to 
achieve greater participation of the target population at regular intervals, 
equity of access and high quality. Despite the consistent evidence that 
organised screening is more efficient than non-organised screening, and in spite 
of the Cancer Screening Recommendations of the European Council, health 
authorities of eight old member states (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, 
Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain) have not yet started national organised 
implementation of screening for cervical cancer. A decision was made by the 
Irish government to extend their pilot programme nationally while new regional 
programmes commenced in Portugal and Spain. Introduction of new methods of 
prevention, such as HPV screening and prophylactic HPV vaccination, can reduce 
the burden further, but this will require a high level of organisation with 
particular attention needed for the maximisation of population coverage, 
compliance with evidence-based guidelines, monitoring of data enabling continued 
evaluation and improvement of the preventive programmes.

Approximately 40-50% of children with cancer will be irradiated during their 
treatment. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by linear accelerator or 
helical tomotherapy improves dose distribution in target volumes and normal 
tissue sparing. This technology could be particularly useful for pediatric 
patients to achieve an optimal dose distribution in complex volumes close to 
critical structures. The use of IMRT can increase the volume of tissue receiving 
low-dose radiation, and consequently carcinogenicity in childhood population 
with a good overall survival and long period of life expectancy. This review 
will present the current and potential IMRT indications for cancers in 
childhood, and discuss the benefits and problems of this technology aiming to 
define recommendations in the use of IMRT and specific doses constraints in 
pediatry.

RATIONALE: Sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy is gaining popularity for 
treatment of allergic diseases, but underlying immunological mechanisms are 
unresolved.
OBJECTIVES: To perform detailed immunological investigation of sublingual house 
dust mite (HDM) immunotherapy.
METHODS: A 12-month randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 
sublingual HDM immunotherapy in 30 HDM-allergic subjects was performed, with 
1-year open extension in 9 patients on active treatment. HDM-stimulated blood 
mononuclear cells were analyzed for proliferation, cytokines, and regulatory T 
cells (Tregs) by flow cytometry and ELISA. Effects of blocking transforming 
growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10 on proliferation were determined. Treg 
suppressor function and allergen-specific antibody levels were measured. 
Clinical efficacy was assessed by symptom, medication, and Juniper 
quality-of-life scores.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Allergen-induced CD4(+) T-cell division and IL-5 
production were significantly decreased after 6- and 12-months' active treatment 
but not placebo. sTGF-betaRII blocked immunotherapy-induced suppression of 
allergen-specific T-cell proliferation, maximal at 6 months. Decreased 
allergen-specific CD4(+) T-cell proliferation and increased IL-10 secretion and 
serum Der p 2-specific IgG(4) were maximal at 24 months' active treatment. Treg 
(CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(lo)/Foxp3(+)) function was demonstrated by suppression of 
allergen-specific effector T-cell (CD4(+)CD25(-)CD127(hi)) proliferation and 
cytokine production. Clinical efficacy of immunotherapy was supported by 
significantly decreased rhinitis symptom score, total asthma score, and Juniper 
quality-of-life score.
CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the novel finding that TGF-beta mediates the 
immunological suppression seen early in clinically effective sublingual HDM 
immunotherapy in addition to an increase in Tregs with suppressor function.

INTRODUCTION: End-stage renal disease is associated with high health-care costs 
and low quality of life compared with chronic kidney disease. The renoprotective 
effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is largely 
determined by the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism. We determined the 
cost-effectiveness of ACEi therapy in nondiabetic nephropathy for the ACE II/ID 
and for the ACE DD genotype separately. Furthermore, we considered a selective 
screen-and-treat strategy in which patients are prescribed alternative, more 
effective, therapy based on their ACE (I/D) polymorphism.
METHODS: Time-dependent Markov models were constructed; cohorts of 1000 patients 
were followed for 10 years. Data were mainly gathered from the Ramipril Efficacy 
In Nephropathy trial. Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: ACEi therapy dominated placebo in both the ACE II/ID group (euro15 826, 
and 0.091 quality-adjusted life years gained per patient) and the ACE DD group 
(euro105 104 and 0.553 quality-adjusted life years gained). Sensitivity analyses 
showed 30.2% probability of ACEi being not cost-effective in the ACE II/ID 
group, against an almost 100% probability of cost-effectiveness in the ACE DD 
group. A selective screen-and-treat strategy should incorporate an alternative 
therapy for patients with the ACE II/ID genotype with an at least 9.1% increase 
in survival time compared with ACEi therapy to be cost-effective. Sensitivity 
analyses show that higher effectiveness and lower costs of the alternative 
therapy improve the cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy.
CONCLUSION: ACEi therapy is a cost-saving treatment compared with placebo in 
nondiabetic nephropathy, irrespective of ACE (I/D) genotype. However, ACEi 
therapy saved more costs and more health gains were achieved in the ACE DD 
genotype than in the ACE II/ID genotype. An alternative treatment featuring a 
modest increase in effectiveness compared with ACEi therapy for patients with 
the ACE II/ID genotype can be incorporated in a cost-effective or even 
cost-saving screen-and-treat strategy.

Netherlands.

PURPOSE: This study was designed to retrospectively analyze outcomes of 
axillofemoral bypass (AxFB) operations performed in patients with severe 
comorbidities.
METHODS: All patients (n = 45) who received an AxFB between 1990 and 2005 for 
aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD, n = 35) or infectious aortic disease (IAD, n 
= 10) were included. Information on patency of the bypass and mortality was 
retrieved from patient records. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed 
to illustrate survival rates, limb salvage, and primary and secondary patency.
RESULTS: Included patients had several comorbidities and a high operative risk. 
In this group, a 30-day mortality rate of 20% was found: 17% for the AIOD group, 
and 30% for the IAD group. During 5-year follow-up 20 patients died, of which 15 
during the first year after operation. Survival rates were at 64 and 41% at 1 
and 5 years and limb salvage rates were 84% for both these years. Primary 
patency rates at 1 and 5 years were 72 and 58%, respectively, and secondary 
patency rates were 86% at both time points.
CONCLUSIONS: High mortality rates were found in AIOD or IAD patients who 
received an AxFB. However, for high-risk patients with an already reduced life 
expectancy, the AxFB remains an alternative with acceptable patency rates.

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
(HIPEC) is associated with high morbidity. The Quality of Life (QoL) assessment 
in this patient group with a limited life expectancy and high recurrence rate is 
important. Published data show an impairment of postoperative Quality of Life at 
3 months postoperatively with an improvement over 6-12 months at levels higher 
than the baseline. Standardized instruments QoL have to be included in clinical 
trials assessing the efficacy of CRS and HIPEC.

Recent molecular pathological investigations have elucidated the 
cytodifferentiation of pituitary cells and identified several transcriptional 
factors that regulate this cytodifferentiation of pituitary cells. The patterns 
of cytodifferentiation are closely related to the pathogenesis of pituitary 
adenomas. Meanwhile, the role of hypothalamic hormones in the development of 
pituitary adenomas has recently attracted the attention of investigators. The 
expression of growth hormone-releasing hormone and corticotrophin releasing 
hormone in corticotroph adenomas have been demonstrated in somatotroph adenomas 
and corticotropin adenomas, respectively. This finding indicates that the 
endogenous expression of hypothalamic hormones and their receptors in human 
pituitary adenoma cells has ample significance in the autocrine or paracrine 
regulation of pituitary hormone production and tumor extension induced by 
hypothalamic hormones produced by adenoma cells. The recent progress in surgical 
techniques for treatment of pituitary adenomas has provided several 
alternatives: transsphenoidal surgery vs. transcranial surgery, sublabial 
approach vs. endonasal approach, and microsurgery vs. endoscopic surgery. There 
have also been developments in the medical treatment of pituitary adenomas. The 
frequently used dopamine agonist, cabergoline, is very effective for treating 
prolactin-producing adenoma. Long-acting octreotide and pegvisomant are now 
available for the treatment of growth hormone producing adenoma. Cabergoline is 
also used for growth hormone producing adenoma. Temozolomide has recently been 
used for atypical adenomas or pituitary carcinomas. Adult growth hormone 
deficiency sometimes occurs in postoperative patients with pituitary adenomas. 
Growth hormone replacement is recommended to maintain the quality of life of 
these patients.

BACKGROUND: The health status of individuals is determined by multiple factors

Measures of health inequalities should reflect such determinants explicitly
