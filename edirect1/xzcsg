billion dollars a year) is currently attributable to chronic complications of 
the disease. These high prevalence rates are widely acknowledged to further rise 
as poor lifestyle choices and their consequences continue to rise. Adding to 
that is an aging population and urbanization that together will make situation 
even more challenging. Type 2 diabetes affects about 90-95% of newly diagnosed 
patients of diabetes and accounts for majority of cases of Chronic Kidney 
Disease (CKD). In other words, CKD affects about 20-40% of individuals with 
diabetes making it one of the most common complication related to the disease. 
The risk of renal failure is 25 times higher in diabetic patients than in the 
non-diabetic population. Thus patients with diabetes and renal failure represent 
a special risk group as they have higher morbidity and mortality and are at a 
higher risk of hypoglycaemia than diabetic individuals with normal renal 
function. In addition, for all the physicians who are taking care of patients of 
diabetes and kidney disease, formulation of comprehensive plan of management 
directed at modification of risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is of 
utmost importance as majority of patients with CKD die as a result of 
cardiovascular complications rather than progression to ESRD, (accounting for 
about 70% of deaths over the age of 65). The contrasting results available from 
clinical trials in recent years have generated perplexity amid concerns that 
glucose-lowering therapies, under certain circumstances, might even be 
detrimental; in light of the fact that intensive glycemic control increased the 
risk for death by 22% in the ACCORD trial. Moreover it should be pooled data of 
some extensive reviews which has been carried in last one and half year have 
demonstrated that intensive glycemic control significantly increases the risk of 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients of CKD. So it is increasingly 
problematic for clinicians to continue aggressive glycemic control for the 
treatment of renal outcome in patients of advanced renal insufficiency with 
multiple co-morbidities. Thus, a lower survival benefit due to multiple 
comorbidities combined with general lower life expectancy necessitates a 
balanced approach. Suggesting the need for revised and extended target of HBA1C 
in this patient population.

Objectives. Assess the short- and long-term survival for patients who underwent 
isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and evaluate the impact of 
gender and age. Furthermore to assess the long-term survival in the CABG group 
compared to the general population. Design. This study included 4044 consecutive 
patients who underwent isolated CABG at Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål, in 
Oslo, Norway in the time period from 01 January 2003 to 31 December 2015. 
Patient data was collected retrospectively from the quality register at the 
department. Information on survival status was obtained from the Norwegian 
National Registry. Life expectancy data for the general population was gained 
from Statistics Norway. Results. Female patients were significantly older than 
male patients at the time of surgery (mean age 67.0 and 63.9 years, 
respectively, p < .001), and had significantly lower 30-day survival (mortality 
was 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively, p = .017). Male gender was independently 
associated with lower long-term survival (p = .0037) in a multivariate analysis. 
Male patients aged less than 60 years also showed significantly lower long-term 
survival (SMR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.49-2.25) compared to the age-matched general 
population. Among patients older than 60 years, survival was similar to survival 
in the age-matched general population. Conclusions. Survival was excellent for 
patients undergoing surgery. Despite increased age and operative mortality, 
female patients had better adjusted long-time survival than male patients. There 
was lower long-term survival among male patients aged less than 60 compared to 
the general population. Our findings may help clinicians in selecting 
appropriate patients for surgery.

BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid reduces death due to bleeding after trauma and 
postpartum haemorrhage.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess if tranexamic acid is safe, 
reduces haematoma expansion and improves outcomes in adults with spontaneous 
intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).
DESIGN: The TICH-2 (Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral 
Haemorrhage) study was a pragmatic, Phase III, prospective, double-blind, 
randomised placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING: Acute stroke services at 124 hospitals in 12 countries (Denmark, 
Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Turkey and the UK).
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with ICH within 8 hours of onset.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Exclusion criteria were ICH secondary to anticoagulation, 
thrombolysis, trauma or a known underlying structural abnormality; patients for 
whom tranexamic acid was thought to be contraindicated; prestroke dependence 
(i.e. patients with a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score > 4); life expectancy 
< 3 months; and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 5.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants, allocated by randomisation, received 1 g of an 
intravenous tranexamic acid bolus followed by an 8-hour 1-g infusion or matching 
placebo (i.e. 0.9% saline).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was functional status (death or 
dependency) at day 90, which was measured by the shift in the mRS score, using 
ordinal logistic regression, with adjustment for stratification and minimisation 
criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 2325 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1161; placebo, 
n = 1164) were recruited from 124 hospitals in 12 countries between 2013 and 
2017. Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline. The primary outcome was 
determined for 2307 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1152; placebo, n = 1155). 
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups 
for the primary outcome of functional status at day 90 [adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.03; p = 0.11]. Although there 
were fewer deaths by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 
to 0.99; p = 0.041), there was no difference in case fatality at 90 days 
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10; p = 0.37). Fewer patients 
experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) after treatment with tranexamic acid 
than with placebo by days 2 (p = 0.027), 7 (p = 0.020) and 90 (p = 0.039). There 
was no increase in thromboembolic events or seizures.
LIMITATIONS: Despite attempts to enrol patients rapidly, the majority of 
participants were enrolled and treated > 4.5 hours after stroke onset. Pragmatic 
inclusion criteria led to a heterogeneous population of participants, some of 
whom had very large strokes. Although 12 countries enrolled participants, the 
majority (82.1%) were from the UK.
CONCLUSIONS: Tranexamic acid did not affect a patient's functional status at 90 
days after ICH, despite there being significant modest reductions in early death 
(by 7 days), haematoma expansion and SAEs, which is consistent with an 
antifibrinolytic effect. Tranexamic acid was safe, with no increase in 
thromboembolic events.
FUTURE WORK: Future work should focus on enrolling and treating patients early 
after stroke and identify which participants are most likely to benefit from 
haemostatic therapy. Large randomised trials are needed.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN93732214.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health 
Technology Assessment; Vol. 23, No. 35. See the NIHR Journals Library website 
for further project information. The project was also funded by the Pragmatic 
Trials, UK, funding call and the Swiss Heart Foundation in Switzerland.

Plain Language Summary: BACKGROUND: Stroke caused by bleeding in the brain [i.e. 
an intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)] is a medical emergency. Around one-third of 
such strokes are complicated by continuing bleeding, which usually occurs within 
the first few hours after trauma and childbirth, and is associated with death or 
severe disability. Tranexamic acid is a drug that is seen to reduce death from 
bleeding after trauma and childbirth.
METHODS: The study enrolled adults within 8 hours of an ICH into this large 
randomised trial. Half of the participants were given an injection of tranexamic 
acid and the other half placebo (in the form of salt water). The main aim of the 
trial was to measure changes in recovery by a telephone questionnaire on how 
much the person was able to do or needed help with 90 days after the stroke 
(i.e. functional status). Other measures included amount of brain bleeding, 
complications after stroke (serious adverse events), drug side effects and death 
within 7 days of stroke.
RESULTS: A total of 2325 participants from 124 hospitals in 12 countries were 
enrolled between 2013 and 2017. Participants treated with tranexamic acid had no 
significant difference in functional status 90 days after stroke. There were 
small but significant reductions in brain bleeding, death in the first 7 days 
and complications after stroke, and tranexamic acid was safe with no increased 
side effects.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with tranexamic acid did not result in a significant 
improvement in recovery at 90 days (i.e. functional status), despite small 
reductions in the number of early deaths, amount of brain bleeding and the 
number of complications. Larger trials are needed to confirm if these small 
benefits observed after treatment with tranexamic acid can significantly improve 
functional status after stroke due to bleeding in the brain (ICH).

Severe mental illness (SMI) is associated with a reduced life expectancy of up 
to 20 years. One possible contributor to this fact is dysregulation of the 
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis. Looking at the morphology of effector 
organs, such as the adrenal glands themselves, could reveal insights into organ 
function and response to possible HPA-dysregulation. This forensic autopsy-based 
study investigated if there were any morphological changes in adrenal glands 
between decedents who had previously been submitted to a psychiatric hospital 
with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 34), bipolar (n = 5), or depressive 
disorder (n = 20), any other psychiatric diagnosis (n = 36) compared with 
decedents who had no previous psychiatric admission (n = 40). Length of 
admissions to psychiatric wards and admission in the 180 days preceding death 
was included in regression as proxy variables for severity of illness. On the 
macroscopic level, we found no difference in gland weight or volume. On the 
microscopic level, we found a 25% increase in cross-sectional area of the zona 
fasciculata (ZF) in decedents who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia compared with 
controls (p = 0.033). Other diagnosis groups did not differ from controls. Total 
admission length was positively correlated with area of the ZF.Lay SummaryPeople 
with a severe mental disorder may be in a constant state of increased stress, 
which is harmful. This study looked at the adrenal gland, which produces stress 
hormones, to see if they were different in deceased persons who had suffered 
from a severe mental illness. We found that the part of the adrenal gland that 
produces stress hormones is larger in deceased patients who suffered from 
schizophrenia, but not other types of psychiatric illnesses, compared to 
deceased persons with no history of psychiatric illness.

Rise in mortality involving poisoning by medicaments other than narcotics, 
including poisoning by psychotropic drugs in different age/racial groups in the 
US.

BACKGROUND: Increase in mortality involving poisoning, particularly by 
narcotics, is known to have been one of the factors that affected life 
expectancy in the US during the last two decades, especially for white Americans 
and Native Americans. However, the contribution of medicaments other than 
narcotics to mortality in different racial/age groups is less studied.
METHODS: We regressed annual rates of mortality involving poisoning by 
medicaments but not narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T36-39.xx or 
T41-50.8 but not T40.xx present as either underlying or contributing causes of 
death), as well as annual rates of mortality for certain subcategories of the 
above, including mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic drugs but not 
narcotics/psychodysleptics (ICD-10 codes T43.xx but not T40.xx present as either 
underlying or contributing causes of death) in different age/racial groups for 
both the 2000-2011 period and the 2011-2017 period against calendar year.
RESULTS: Annual numbers of deaths involving poisoning by medicaments but not 
narcotics/psychodysleptics grew from 4,332 between 2000-2001 to 11,401 between 
2016-2017, with the growth in the rates of those deaths being higher for the 
2011-2017 period compared to the 2000-2011 period. The largest increases in the 
rates of mortality involving poisoning by medicaments but not 
narcotics/psychodysleptics were in non-elderly Non-Hispanic Native Americans, 
followed by Non-Hispanic whites. Most of those increases came from increases in 
the rates of mortality involving poisoning by psychotropic medications; the 
latter rates grew for the period of 2015-2017 vs. 2000-2002 by factors ranging 
from 2.75 for ages 35-44y to 5.37 for ages 55-64y.
CONCLUSIONS: There were major increases in mortality involving poisoning by 
non-narcotic, particularly psychotropic medicaments, especially in non-elderly 
non-Hispanic whites and Native Americans. Our results support the need for a 
comprehensive evaluation of the effect of psychotropic medications on 
health-related outcomes, including mortality for causes other than poisoning, 
and the impact of medication misuse.

Unlike most bivalve shellfishes, giant clams (tridacnines) harbor symbiotic 
microalgae (zooxanthellae) in their fleshy bodies. Zooxanthellae are not 
maternally inherited by tridacnine offspring, hence, the larvae must acquire 
zooxanthellae from external sources, although such algal populations or sources 
in the environment are currently unknown. It is well known that giant clams 
expel fecal pellets that contain viable zooxanthellae cells, but whether these 
cells are infectious or just an expelled overpopulation from the giant clams has 
not been investigated. In this study, we observed the ultrastructural and 
photosynthetic competencies of zooxanthellae in the fecal pellets of Tridacna 
crocea and further tested the ability of these cells to infect T. squamosa 
juveniles. The ultrastructure of the zooxanthellae cells showed that the cells 
were intact and had not undergone digestion. Additionally, these zooxanthellae 
cells showed a maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) as high as those 
retained in the mantle of the giant clam. Under the assumption that feces might 
provide symbionts to the larvae of other giant clams, fecal pellets from 
Tridacna squamosa and T. crocea were given to artificially hatched 1-day-old T. 
squamosa larvae. On the 9th day, 15-34% of the larvae provided with the fecal 
pellets took up zooxanthellae in their stomach, and on the 14th day, 
zooxanthellae cells reached the larval margin, indicating the establishment of 
symbiosis. The rate reaching this stage was highest, ca. 5.3%, in the larvae 
given whole (nonhomogenized) pellets from T. crocea. The composition of 
zooxanthellae genera contained in the larvae were similar to those in the fecal 
pellets, although the abundance ratios were significantly different. This study 
is the first to demonstrate the potential of giant clam fecal pellets as 
symbiont vectors to giant clam larvae. These results also demonstrate the 
possibility that fecal pellets are a source of zooxanthellae in coral reefs.

Polydeoxyadenosine (poly (dA)) has been extensively applied for detecting many 
drug molecules. Herein, we developed a sensitive method for detecting coralyne 
and heparin using a modified DNA probe with poly (dA) at one end. In the absence 
of coralyne, the DNA probe was digested by the Exonuclease I (Exo I), and 
therefore the SYBR Green I (SG I) emitted an extremely low fluorescent signal. 
While coralyne specifically binding to poly (dA) with strong propensity could 
remarkably restrain the disintegration of the DNA probe, through which as a 
template the second strand of DNA sequence was formed with the introduction of 
DNA polymerase. Therefore, the fluorescent signal of SG I was intensified to 
quantify coralyne. Based on this method, heparin can be determined due to its 
strong affinity towards coralyne. This method showed a linear range from 2 to 
500 nM for coralyne with a low detection limit of 0.98 nM, and the linear range 
of heparin was from 1 to 100 nM when 1.25 nm was the detection limit. The 
proposed method was also implemented successfully in biological samples and 
showed a potential application for screening potential therapeutic molecules.

Advances in medicine and improvements in life quality has led to an increase in 
the life expectancy of the general population. An ageing world population have 
placed demands on the use of assistive technology and, in particular, towards 
novel healthcare devices and sensors. Besides the electromagnetic field 
immunity, polymer optical fiber (POF) sensors have additional advantages due to 
their material features such as high flexibility, lower Young's modulus 
(enabling high sensitivity for mechanical parameters), higher elastic limits, 
and impact resistance. Such advantages are well-aligned with the instrumentation 
requirements of many healthcare devices and in movement analysis. Aiming at 
these advantages, this review paper presents the state-of-the-art developments 
of POF sensors for healthcare applications. A plethora of healthcare 
applications are discussed, which include movement analysis, physiological 
parameters monitoring, instrumented insoles, as well as instrumentation of 
healthcare robotic devices such as exoskeletons, smart walkers, actuators, 
prostheses, and orthosis. This review paper shows the feasibility of using POF 
sensors in healthcare applications and, due to the aforementioned advantages, it 
is possible to envisage a further widespread use of such sensors in this 
research field in the next few years.

BACKGROUND: Antioxidative enzymes contribute to a parasite's ability to 
counteract the host's intracellular killing mechanisms. The facultative 
intracellular oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, a sister taxon to 
dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, is responsible for mortalities of oysters 
along the Atlantic coast of North America. Parasite trophozoites enter molluscan 
hemocytes by subverting the phagocytic response while inhibiting the typical 
respiratory burst. Because P. marinus lacks catalase, the mechanism(s) by which 
the parasite evade the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide had remained unclear. 
We previously found that P. marinus displays an ascorbate-dependent peroxidase 
(APX) activity typical of photosynthetic eukaryotes. Like other alveolates, the 
evolutionary history of P. marinus includes multiple endosymbiotic events. The 
discovery of APX in P. marinus raised the questions: From which ancestral 
lineage is this APX derived, and what role does it play in the parasite's life 
history?
RESULTS: Purification of P. marinus cytosolic APX activity identified a 32 kDa 
protein. Amplification of parasite cDNA with oligonucleotides corresponding to 
peptides of the purified protein revealed two putative APX-encoding genes, 
designated PmAPX1 and PmAPX2. The predicted proteins are 93% identical, and 
PmAPX2 carries a 30 amino acid N-terminal extension relative to PmAPX1. The P. 
marinus APX proteins are similar to predicted APX proteins of dinoflagellates, 
and they more closely resemble chloroplastic than cytosolic APX enzymes of 
plants. Immunofluorescence for PmAPX1 and PmAPX2 shows that PmAPX1 is 
cytoplasmic, while PmAPX2 is localized to the periphery of the central vacuole. 
Three-dimensional modeling of the predicted proteins shows pronounced 
differences in surface charge of PmAPX1 and PmAPX2 in the vicinity of the 
aperture that provides access to the heme and active site.
CONCLUSIONS: PmAPX1 and PmAPX2 phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are 
derived from a plant ancestor. Plant ancestry is further supported by the 
presence of ascorbate synthesis genes in the P. marinus genome that are similar 
to those in plants. The localizations and 3D structures of the two APX isoforms 
suggest that APX fulfills multiple functions in P. marinus within two 
compartments. The possible role of APX in free-living and parasitic stages of 
the life history of P. marinus is discussed.

BACKGROUND: To draw optimal benefits of the demographic dividend, healthy life 
years of the young adults is a growing concern in India. Rising prevalence of 
chronic non-communicable diseases among the younger population is responsible 
for increasing the life years lived with disability among them and for affecting 
their productivity in turn. This study measures the disability burden in various 
Indian sub-populations and assesses the contribution of disability to the change 
in person years lived with a disability during 2001-11.
METHODS: Data from the Census of India, 2001 and 2011 was used for 
estimating the age distribution and disability prevalence among males and 
females. The Sample Registration System was used for age-specific mortality rate 
to calculate the life table for 15 states in India. Life years Lived with 
Disability (LLD) were estimated using the Sullivan method. The extension of 
Arriaga method was used to decompose change in life years lived with disability 
into Mortality and Disability Effect (ME and DE, respectively). Positive ME 
explains improvement in life years due to decline in mortality rate and a 
negative DE explains a decline in disability incidence in 2001-11.
RESULTS: At national level, the disability prevalence has increased from 2001 to 
2011. The prevalence of disability and the share of LLD to Life Expectancy (LE) 
is higher for males. High and medium fertility states scored highest on living 
with disability to LE ratio and measured DE in the decomposition analysis. At 
the national level, the DE increased in the age groups of 20-35 years. It was 
higher among the females. The states that are in the advanced stages of 
demographic transition show a negative DE.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights expansion of DE in prime productive years of 
life, especially among females, in medium and high fertility states. Decline in 
skilled employment and productivity can be two major economic adversities due to 
increasing DE in working ages. Disability among young and working age population 
needs to be prioritised as most of the Indian states stand at crucial stages of 
demographic transitions.

In order to improve access to costly biological treatments, a biosimilar pathway 
in the United States of America (USA) was enacted under the Biologics Price 
Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act) of 2009. The aim of the present study 
was to investigate how the health policy, the establishment of the biosimilar 
pathway, influenced related companies by studying their respective perspectives 
and strategies revealed in literatures and publicly available resources. 
Perspectives of companies reveal the points of concern for the biosimilar 
pathway, such as data requirements, patents, interchangeability, naming, and 
exclusivity. Innovator companies may utilize expedited programs for serious 
conditions, enhance patent protection, launch programs for life-cycle extension, 
and develop biosimilars as well. The biosimilar companies overcoming technical 
barriers might need to gather convincing evidence to facilitate market 
penetration as well as to distinguish their products from those of other 
biosimilar competitors. More challenges are expected for innovator companies if 
international harmonization takes place, which might be worth further 
investigation.

On 9 May 2019, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
published its updated UK guidance on prostate cancer. The publication is the 
culmination of a 3 year process. It is an evidence-based, carefully crafted, 
comprehensive "book" to compliment the pre-existing 2014 guidance. It was born 
from new evidence on aspects of prostate cancer treatment and, most relevant for 
this special edition, diagnosis. This article provides a "behind-the-scenes" on 
how NICE operates, using the guideline as a case study. The piece sets out to 
demystify this august governance body's processes: from the decision to update 
the existing guidance, through the scoping and discussion stages to the 
principles and policies that shaped the whole process. This provides the 
backdrop to the second half of the article wherein the 85 page guideline is 
condensed in to a few highly pertinent recommendations. The areas that sparked 
the most debate during the committee's 24-month lifespan are highlighted, 
finishing by asking the UK radiology community: where do we go next in this new 
era of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging first?

Emerging evidence suggests seeding and prion-like propagation of mutant 
Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) misfolding to be a potential mechanism for ALS 
pathogenesis and progression. Immuno-targeting of misfolded SOD1 has shown 
positive clinical outcomes in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. However, a major 
challenge in developing active immunotherapies for proteinopathies such as ALS 
is the design of immunogens enabling exclusive recognition of pathogenic species 
of a self-protein. Ideally, one would achieve a robust antibody response against 
the disease-misfolded protein while sparing the natively folded conformer to 
avoid inducing deleterious autoimmune complications, or inhibiting its normal 
function. Using a motor neuron disease mouse model expressing human SOD1-G37R, 
we herein report the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of two ALS 
vaccines, tgG-DSE2lim and tgG-DSE5b, based on the notion that native SOD1 would 
undergo early unfolding in disease to present "disease specific epitopes" (DSE). 
Both vaccines elicited rapid, robust, and well-sustained epitope-specific 
antibody responses with a desirable Th2-biased immune response. Both vaccines 
significantly extended the life expectancy of hSOD1G37R mice, with tgG-DSE2lim 
displaying greater protection than tgG-DSE5b at earlier pre-symptomatic stage. 
tgG-DSE5b, but not tgG-DSE2lim, significantly delayed disease onset and 
appreciably slowed disease progression. This implies that conformationally 
distinct species of misfolded SOD1 may derive from the same mutation, thereby 
modifying disease phenotypes in a different fashion. Our results validate the 
rationale for conformation-based immuno-targeting of misfolded SOD1 as a 
promising therapeutic strategy to slow or even halt disease progression in 
familial ALS associated with SOD1 mutations, as well as a prophylactic 
intervention for carriers of SOD1 mutations. Our study not only provides 
important proof-of-principle data for the development of a safe and effective 
human therapeutic/prophylactic ALS vaccine against misfolded SOD1, but also 
predicts a great potential to extend our DSE-based vaccination approach to other 
types of ALS, such as those associated with TDP-43 proteinopathies.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute hepatitis worldwide 
including large water-borne outbreaks, zoonotic infections and transfusion 
transmissions. Several countries have initiated or are considering blood donor 
screening in response to high HEV-RNA donation prevalence leading to 
transfusion-transmission risk. Because HEV transmission is more common through 
food sources, the efficacy of blood donor screening alone may be limited. 
HEV-nucleic acids in 101 489 blood donations in the United States and Canada 
were studied. A risk-based decision-making framework was used to evaluate the 
quantitative risks and cost-benefit of HEV-blood donation screening in Canada 
comparing three scenarios: no screening, screening blood for all transfused 
patients or screening blood for only those at greatest risk. HEV-RNA prevalence 
in the United States was one per 16 908 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1:5786-1:81987), whereas Canadian HEV-RNA prevalence was one per 4615 (95% CI, 
1:2579-1:9244). Although 4-fold greater, Canadian HEV-RNA prevalence was not 
significantly higher than in the United States. Viral loads ranged from 20 to 
3080 international units per mL; all successfully typed infections were genotype 
3. No HEV-RNA false-positive donations were identified for 100 percent 
specificity. Without donation screening, heart and lung transplant recipients 
had the greatest HEV-infection risk (1:366962) versus kidney transplant 
recipients with the lowest (1:2.8 million) at costs of $225 546 to $561 810 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for partial or universal screening, 
respectively. Higher cost per QALY would be expected in the United States. Thus, 
HEV prevalence in North America is lower than in countries performing blood 
donation screening, and if implemented, is projected to be costly under any 
scenario.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) presenting with stroke in a young man.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene which 
maps to the short arm of chromosome 19 and encodes the NOTCH3 receptor protein, 
predominantly expressed in adults by vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes. 
The receptor has a large extracellular domain with 34 epidermal growth 
factor-like repeats encoded by exons 2-24, the site at which CADASIL mutations 
are most commonly found. Migraine with aura is often the earliest feature of the 
disease, with an increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression 
suggested as a possible aetiological mechanism. Stroke, acute encephalopathy and 
cognitive impairment can also occur. Hypertension and smoking are associated 
with early age of onset of stroke. It diffusely affects white matter, with 
distinct findings on T2- weighted MRI, involving the external capsule, anterior 
poles of the temporal lobe and superior frontal gyri, displaying a 
characteristic pattern of leucoencephalopathy. Affected individuals have a 
reduced life expectancy. An effective treatment for CADASIL is not available. 
The authors describe a 35-year-old manwith an unremarkable medical history, 
presenting to the emergency department with slurred speech and increased 
confusion 3 days following a fall. He was a smoker and consumed 16 units of 
alcohol weekly. He was hypertensive and tachycardic. Physical examination 
confirmed increased tone in his lower limbs and dysarthria. His CT head showed 
severe cerebral atrophy, multiple small old infarcts and moderate background 
microvascular disease. Further investigation with an MRI head confirmed multiple 
white matter abnormalities with microhaemorrhages. The possibility of a 
hereditary vasculopathy was rendered as the appearances were thought consistent 
with a diagnosis of CADASIL. Genetic testing identified the NOTCH3 gene thus 
confirming the diagnosis. This paper provides an overview of the aetiology, 
clinical presentation, pathogenesis, investigations and management of CADASIL.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A patient's prognosis and risk of adverse drug effects are 
important considerations for individualizing care of older patients with 
diabetes. This review summarizes the evidence for risk assessment and proposes 
approaches for clinicians in the context of current clinical guidelines.
RECENT FINDINGS: Diabetes guidelines vary in their recommendations for how life 
expectancy should be estimated and used to inform the selection of glycemic 
targets. Readily available prognostic tools may improve estimation of life 
expectancy but require validation among patients with diabetes. Treatment 
decisions based on prognosis are difficult for clinicians to communicate and for 
patients to understand. Determining hypoglycemia risk involves assessing major 
risk factors; models to synthesize these factors have been developed. Applying 
risk assessment to individualize diabetes care is complex and currently relies 
heavily on clinician judgment. More research is need to validate structured 
approaches to risk assessment and determine how to incorporate them into 
patient-centered diabetes care.

The goal of this study is to integrate k-means clustering with data envelopment 
analysis to examine technical efficiencies in public hospitals in Turkey. A 
two-step analysis procedure involving provinces and public hospitals is applied 
in this study. The first step examines similar provinces in terms of welfare 
state indicators by using k-means clustering and silhouette (Sil) cluster 
validity index measures. Then, the efficiencies of public hospitals in different 
groups of provinces are determined. The data are taken from the Turkish 
Statistical Institute and the 2017 Public Hospitals Statistical Year Book for 
eighty-one provinces and 688 public hospitals. Study results show that, relative 
to similarities of welfare state indicators, there are five province groups 
(Sil = .58). The number of technically inefficient public hospitals is greater 
than the number of technically efficient public hospitals in all groups. Study 
results emphasize that incorporated methodology of k-means clustering with data 
envelopment analysis is useful to identify efficiencies of public hospitals 
located in provinces that have similar welfare status.

The 1918 influenza pandemic had not only a massive instant death toll but also 
lasting effects on its survivors. Several studies have shown that children born 
in 1919, and thus exposed to the H1N1 virus in utero, experienced worse health 
and socioeconomic outcomes in older ages than surrounding birth cohorts. This 
study combines several sources of contemporary statistics with full-population 
individual-level data for Sweden during 1968-2012 to examine the influence of 
fetal exposure to the Spanish flu on health, adulthood income, and occupational 
attainment. For both men and women, fetal exposure resulted in higher morbidity 
in ages 54-87, as measured by hospitalization. For males, exposure during the 
second trimester also affected mortality in cancer and heart disease. Overall, 
the effects on all-cause mortality were modest, with about three months shorter 
remaining life expectancy for the cohorts exposed during the second trimester. 
For socioeconomic outcomes, results fail to provide consistent evidence 
supporting any long-term consequences of fetal exposure. We conclude that 
although the immediate health effects of exposure to the 1918 pandemic were 
huge, the long-term effects were modest in size.

BACKGROUND: People with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV ) infections 
are vulnerable to opportunistic infections because of a weakened immune system. 
Early diagnosis of Opportunistic infections and prompt treatment definitely 
contributes to increased life expectancy among infected patients and delays the 
progression to AIDS.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: are to study the incidence, clinical spectrum and outcome 
of opportunistic infections and relation between opportunistic infections and 
CD4 count.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in the Anti Retroviral Treatment 
(ART ) clinic and medical wards of Government Medical College, Kozhikode. The 
study period was from January 2012 to January 2013 till 100 opportunistic 
infections are identified in newly diagnosed retro positive patients. This was a 
clinical observational study. 424 newly diagnosed retro positive patients were 
screened to identify 100 patients having opportunistic infections and they were 
studied in detail.
RESULTS: Out of the 100 patients, 71 were males and 29 were females.67% were in 
the age group of 30-49 years. The most common symptom of presentation was weight 
loss (77%) followed by fever (67%) and mucocutaneous lesions (60%). The 
commonest opportunistic infection detected was candidiasis (52%) followed by 
tuberculosis (50%).Majority of the patients had a CD4 count between 50-200/ 
microL. Out of the 100 patients 19 patients expired. Among them 10 patients had 
disseminated tuberculosis. Incidence of opportunistic infection was 23.59/100 
person years.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Oral candidiasis is the commonest 
opportunistic infection in HIV patients and Tuberculosis is the second most 
common. The incidence of opportunistic infection is higher in the older age 
groups, males and patients with lowCD4 count.
