RESULTS: ABI if cardiac rehabilitation fails was the most favorable strategy 
with an ICER of $44,251 per QALY gained and an incremental NHB compared to 
cardiac rehabilitation only of 0.03 QALYs (95% CI: -0.17, 0.29) at a threshold 
willingness-to-pay of $75,000/QALY. After sensitivity analysis, a combined 
cardiac and vascular rehabilitation program increased the success rate and would 
dominate the other two strategies with total lifetime costs of $30,246 a 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 3.84 years, and an incremental NHB of 0.06 
QALYs (95%CI:-0.24, 0.46) compared to current practice. The results were robust 
for other different input parameters.
CONCLUSION: ABI measurement if cardiac rehabilitation fails followed by a 
diagnostic work-up and revascularization for PAD if needed are potentially 
cost-effective compared to cardiac rehabilitation only.

AIMS: To investigate the long-term clinical outcome (up to 30 years) after 
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and to assess the life expectancy 
(LE) among subgroups of patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the 30-year outcome of the first 1041 
consecutive patients in our institution (age at operation 53 years, 88% male) 
who underwent venous CABG between 1971 and 1980. During follow-up, every 5-7 
years follow-up status was obtained by reviewing the hospital records and from 
general practitioners and civil registries. Data were collected on death and 
repeat coronary revascularization procedures. Follow-up was complete in 98%. 
Median follow-up was 29 years (26-36 years). The cumulative 10-, 20-, and 
30-year survival rates were 77%, 40%, and 15%, respectively. Overall, 623 
coronary re-interventions were performed in 373 patients (36%). The cumulative 
10-, 20-, and 30-year freedom from death and coronary re-intervention rates were 
60%, 20%, and 6%, respectively. Age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.04/year], extent of 
vessel disease (VD) (two-VD HR 1.4; three-VD HR 1.9), left main disease (HR 1.6) 
and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (HR 1.8) were independent 
predictors of mortality. We were able to assess the exact LE by calculating the 
area under the Kaplan-Meier curves. Overall LE after first CABG was 17.6 years. 
LE in patients with one-, two-, and three-VD was 21.4, 18.8, and 15.4 years, 
respectively (P < 0.0001). Patients with impaired LVEF had a significant shorter 
LE than patients with normal LVEF (13.9% vs. 19.3%; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This 30-year follow-up study comprises the almost complete life 
cycle after CABG surgery. Overall median LE was 17.6 years. As the majority of 
the patients (94%) needed a repeat intervention, we conclude that the classic 
venous bypass technique is a useful but palliative treatment of a progressive 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Value-of-life methods are increasingly used in policy analyses of 
the economic burden of disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate and 
project the value of life lost from cancer deaths in the United States.
METHODS: We estimated and projected US age-specific mortality rates for all 
cancers and for 16 types of cancer in men and 18 cancers in women in the years 
2000-2020 and applied them to US population projections to estimate the number 
of deaths in each year. Cohort life tables were used to calculate the remaining 
life expectancy in the absence of cancer deaths-the person-years of life lost 
(PYLL). We used a willingness-to-pay approach in which the value of life lost 
due to cancer death was calculated by multiplying PYLL by an estimate of the 
value of 1 year of life ($150,000). We performed sensitivity analyses for female 
breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers using varying assumptions about 
future cancer mortality rates through the year 2020.
RESULTS: The value of life lost from all cancer deaths in the year 2000 was 
$960.6 billion; lung cancer alone represented more than 25% of this value. 
Projections for the year 2020 with current cancer mortality rates showed a 53% 
increase in the total value of life lost ($1472.5 billion). Projected annual 
decreases of cancer mortality rates of 2% reduced the expected value of life 
lost in the year 2020 from $121.0 billion to $80.7 billion for breast cancer, 
$140.1 billion to $93.5 billion for colorectal cancer, from $433.4 billion to 
$289.4 billion for lung cancer, and from $58.4 billion to $39.0 billion for 
prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimated value of life lost due to cancer deaths in the United 
States is substantial and expected to increase dramatically, even if mortality 
rates remain constant, because of expected population changes. These estimates 
and projections may help target investments in cancer control strategies to 
tumor sites that are likely to result in the greatest burden of disease and to 
interventions that are the most cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: A model that predicts the economic benefit of reduced cancer 
mortality provides critical information for allocating scarce resources to the 
interventions with the greatest benefits.
METHODS: We developed models using the human capital approach, which relies on 
earnings as a measure of productivity, to estimate the value of productivity 
lost as a result of cancer mortality. The base model aggregated age- and 
sex-specific data from four primary sources: 1) the US Bureau of the Census, 2) 
US death certificate data for 1999-2003, 3) cohort life tables from the Berkeley 
Mortality Database for 1900-2000, and 4) the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current 
Population Survey. In a model that included costs of caregiving and household 
work, data from the National Human Activity Pattern Survey and the Caregiving in 
the U.S. study were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed using six types of 
cancer assuming a 1% decline in cancer mortality rates. The values of forgone 
earnings for employed individuals and imputed forgone earnings for informal 
caregiving were then estimated for the years 2000-2020.
RESULTS: The annual productivity cost from cancer mortality in the base model 
was approximately $115.8 billion in 2000; the projected value was $147.6 billion 
for 2020. Death from lung cancer accounted for more than 27% of productivity 
costs. A 1% annual reduction in lung, colorectal, breast, leukemia, pancreatic, 
and brain cancer mortality lowered productivity costs by $814 million per year. 
Including imputed earnings lost due to caregiving and household activity 
increased the base model total productivity cost to $232.4 billion in 2000 and 
to $308 billion in 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: Investments in programs that target the cancers with high incidence 
and/or cancers that occur in younger, working-age individuals are likely to 
yield the greatest reductions in productivity losses to society.

Management of patients with carotid artery stenosis.

Roffi M(1), LÃ¼scher TF.

Author information:
(1)Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, 
Geneva, Switzerland. Marco.Roffi@hcuge.ch

A stenosis of the internal carotid artery may cause 10-20% of all ischemic 
strokes. Duplex ultrasound is the diagnostic cornerstone, and CT angiography or 
MR angiography may be used to confirm the severity of the stenosis or prior to 
revascularization. Catheter-based digital subtraction angiography is rarely 
needed for diagnostic purposes. In symptomatic patients, carotid 
revascularization is indicated in the presence of a stenosis >or= 50%. In 
asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularization based on randomized 
trials is given at >or= 60% stenosis, as long as the estimated perioperative 
death or stroke risk is < 3%. In clinical practice, however, asymptomatic 
stenoses are usually treated only if luminal narrowing exceeds 70-80% and the 
patient has a life expectancy of at least 5 years. The choice of the 
revascularization strategy (endarterectomy vs. stenting) should be based on the 
patient's surgical risk profile and on the locally available expertise. 
Independently of the revascularization option, carotid artery stenosis patients 
remain at risk of cardiovascular events because of the high prevalence of 
associated coronary artery disease. A broad disease management focusing on risk 
factor and lifestyle modification may impact quality and duration of life of 
these patients to a greater extent than the revascularization procedure itself.

Regeneration: rewarding, but potentially risky.

Some bilaterally symmetric animals, such as flatworms, annelids, and nemerteans, 
are renowned for their outstanding regeneration capacity-even a fraction of the 
body can give rise to a complete new animal. However, not all species of these 
taxa can regenerate equally well-some cannot regenerate at all. If regeneration 
was purely beneficial, why cannot all of members of the flat, round, and ribbon 
worms regenerate? At that, why cannot all other bilaterians, including humans, 
regenerate as well? Regeneration capacity is an obvious advantage in accidental, 
predatory, and parasitic loss of body parts and is also closely intertwined with 
asexual reproduction strategies. Regeneration is suspected to play a role in 
life span extension or even rejuvenation. An answer for reduced or missing 
regeneration capacity in many species may be found in limitations of the body 
plan, high costs, and inherent dangers of regeneration. Defects in adults and 
juveniles are shown, and similarities between development and regeneration are 
pointed out. With a focus on some worms, but also highlighting comparisons with 
other animal taxa, putative reasons for a limited and an advanced regeneration 
capacity are discussed in this article.

[Histological modifications observed in prostate after preserving treatments for

Total prostatectomy remains the main treatment for intermediate risk prostate 
cancer with a life expectancy greater than 10 years. In other cases non-surgical 
treatments can be proposed: external radiotherapy (exclusive or combined 
anti-androgen therapy), brachytherapy with permanent implants, high frequency 
ultrasounds (HIFU, Ablatherm), cryotherapy or exclusive hormonal treatment. For 
such patients in case of biological recurrence, prostate biopsies are usually 
performed in order to affirm the local recurrence. The histological confirmation 
of persistent tumor is usually required before any treatment: salvage surgery, 
cryotherapy, and brachytherapy or high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). 
Pathologists must be aware of the histological modifications induced by these 
different treatments in order to ensure an optimal interpretation of the 
biopsies. In this review, we describe the modifications observed in the normal 
prostate and in cancers after these various therapeutic methods, and also after 
alpha reductase inhibitors proposed as treatment of benign prostate hypertrophy 
and prostate cancer chemoprevention.

Recommending mammography screening beyond 80 years of age: a time for caution.

Evaluation of: Badgwell BB, Giordano SH, Duan ZZ et al.: Mammography before 
diagnosis among women age 80 years and older with breast cancer. J. Clin. Oncol. 
26, 5-8 (2008). While strong scientific evidence of efficacy supports the 
recommendation of mammography screening up to the age of 74 years, the current 
recommendation of continuing screening up to or beyond the age of 80 years, 
issued by several guidelines, is not based on controlled evidence of screening 
efficacy, but simply on the assumption that mammography increases its accuracy 
with age and that mammography screening must be beneficial, providing that life 
expectancy is long enough to allow for the benefit to take place. In the present 
study, a large series of breast cancer patients aged 80 years or above was 
considered, demonstrating that mammography use is associated with less advanced 
stage at diagnosis and with better survival. The authors conclude that the 
opportunity for continuing screening beyond the age of 80 years, owing to its 
potential benefit, should be discussed with patients, particularly those without 
significant comorbidity, foretelling a longer life expectancy. Although their 
findings may also suggest a benefit in terms of mortality reduction, the clear 
presence of a healthy screening effect, lead time and overdiagnosis 
considerations call for major caution, since screening might be more detrimental 
than beneficial.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is the third main cause of death in Iran. This report was 
provided for explaining cancer incidence and mortality.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The National Cancer Registry reports from 2003 to 2006, 
population-based cancer registry reports from five provinces in 2006 and 
National Death Registry reports from 1999 to 2004 have been applied in this 
report.
RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate of cancers was 98 and 110 per 
100,000 among females and males. The male to female standard ratio was 1.12. The 
most common cancer among women and men was breast cancer (24) and stomach cancer 
(15), respectively. The estimated mortality rate for cancer was 41.1 and 65 per 
100,000 for females and males in 2004.
CONCLUSION: The current low cancer incidence rates in Iran might be due to lack 
of national cancer screening programs for prostate, colorectal or breast cancer, 
a consequence of incomplete registration as well as incomplete diagnosis of 
cancer patients; it is expected that it will rise dramatically in the future 
because of anticipated increase in life expectancy and westernized lifestyle. 
The first priorities for health policy makers should be developing, establishing 
and implementing national cancer control; or else, the health system could not 
respond to the demands regarding to diagnosis, treatment and palliation for 
these patients in the future.

Principles of long-term dynamics of dendritic spines.

Long-term potentiation of synapse strength requires enlargement of dendritic 
spines on cerebral pyramidal neurons. Long-term depression is linked to spine 
shrinkage. Indeed, spines are dynamic structures: they form, change their shapes 
and volumes, or can disappear in the space of hours. Do all such changes result 
from synaptic activity, or do some changes result from intrinsic processes? How 
do enlargement and shrinkage of spines relate to elimination and generation of 
spines, and how do these processes contribute to the stationary distribution of 
spine volumes? To answer these questions, we recorded the volumes of many 
individual spines daily for several days using two-photon imaging of CA1 
pyramidal neurons in cultured slices of rat hippocampus between postnatal days 
17 and 23. With normal synaptic transmission, spines often changed volume or 
were created or eliminated, thereby showing activity-dependent plasticity. 
However, we found that spines changed volume even after we blocked synaptic 
activity, reflecting a native instability of these small structures over the 
long term. Such "intrinsic fluctuations" showed unique dependence on spine 
volume. A mathematical model constructed from these data and the theory of 
random fluctuations explains population behaviors of spines, such as rates of 
elimination and generation, stationary distribution of volumes, and the 
long-term persistence of large spines. Our study finds that generation and 
elimination of spines are more prevalent than previously believed, and spine 
volume shows significant correlation with its age and life expectancy. The 
population dynamics of spines also predict key psychological features of memory.

OBJECTIVE: An economic evaluation of therapeutic massage, exercise, and lessons 
in the Alexander technique for treating persistent back pain.
DESIGN: Cost consequences study and cost effectiveness analysis at 12 month 
follow-up of a factorial randomised controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain recruited 
from primary care.
INTERVENTIONS: Normal care (control), massage, and six or 24 lessons in the 
Alexander technique. Half of each group were randomised to a prescription for 
exercise from a doctor plus behavioural counselling from a nurse.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs to the NHS and to participants. Comparison of costs 
with Roland-Morris disability score (number of activities impaired by pain), 
days in pain, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Comparison of NHS costs 
with QALY gain, using incremental cost effectiveness ratios and cost 
effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: Intervention costs ranged from pound30 for exercise prescription to 
pound596 for 24 lessons in Alexander technique plus exercise. Cost of health 
services ranged from pound50 for 24 lessons in Alexander technique to pound124 
for exercise. Incremental cost effectiveness analysis of single therapies showed 
that exercise offered best value ( pound61 per point on disability score, pound9 
per additional pain-free day, pound2847 per QALY gain). For two-stage therapy, 
six lessons in Alexander technique combined with exercise was the best value 
(additional pound64 per point on disability score, pound43 per additional 
pain-free day, pound5332 per QALY gain).
CONCLUSIONS: An exercise prescription and six lessons in Alexander technique 
alone were both more than 85% likely to be cost effective at values above 
pound20 000 per QALY, but the Alexander technique performed better than exercise 
on the full range of outcomes. A combination of six lessons in Alexander 
technique lessons followed by exercise was the most effective and cost effective 
option.

Subcutaneous transplants of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) are 
capable of generating ectopic bone and organizing functional hematopoietic 
marrow elements in animal models. Here we report that immunocompromised mice 
received subcutaneous BMMSC transplants using hydroxyapatite tricalcium 
phosphate as a carrier suppressed age-related degeneration in multiple organs 
and benefited an increase in life span extension compared with control 
littermates. The newly organized ectopic bone/marrow system restores active 
hematopoiesis via the erythropoietin receptor/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 5 (Stat5) pathway. Furthermore, the BMMSC recipient mice showed 
elevated level of Klotho and suppression of insulin-like growth factor I 
signaling, which may be the mechanism contributing to the alleviation of 
aging-like phenotypes and prolongation of life in the treated mice. This work 
reveals that erythropoietin receptor/Stat5 pathway contributes to 
BMMSC-organized ectopic hematopoiesis, which may offer a treatment paradigm of 
reversing age-related degeneration of multiple organs in adult immunocompromised 
mice.

Genetic evidence linking age-dependent attenuation of the 26S proteasome with 
the aging process.

The intracellular accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins is believed to 
contribute to aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, the 
links between age-dependent proteotoxicity and cellular protein degradation 
systems remain poorly understood. Here, we show that 26S proteasome activity and 
abundance attenuate with age, which is associated with the impaired assembly of 
the 26S proteasome with the 19S regulatory particle (RP) and the 20S proteasome. 
In a genetic gain-of-function screen, we characterized Rpn11, which encodes a 
subunit of the 19S RP, as a suppressor of expanded polyglutamine-induced 
progressive neurodegeneration. Rpn11 overexpression suppressed the age-related 
reduction of the 26S proteasome activity, resulting in the extension of flies' 
life spans with suppression of the age-dependent accumulation of ubiquitinated 
proteins. On the other hand, the loss of function of Rpn11 caused an early onset 
of reduced 26S proteasome activity and a premature age-dependent accumulation of 
ubiquitinated proteins. It also caused a shorter life span and an enhanced 
neurodegenerative phenotype. Our results suggest that maintaining the 26S 
proteasome with age could extend the life span and suppress the age-related 
progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The SPORT (Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial) reported favorable 
surgery outcomes over 2 years among patients with stenosis with and without 
degenerative spondylolisthesis, but the economic value of these surgeries is 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term cost-effectiveness of spine surgery relative 
to nonoperative care for stenosis alone and for stenosis with spondylolisthesis.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
DATA SOURCES: Resource utilization, productivity, and EuroQol EQ-5D score 
measured at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment among SPORT 
participants.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients with image-confirmed spinal stenosis, with and 
without degenerative spondylolisthesis.
TIME HORIZON: 2 years.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Nonoperative care or surgery (primarily decompressive laminectomy 
for stenosis and decompressive laminectomy with fusion for stenosis associated 
with degenerative spondylolisthesis).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among 634 patients with stenosis, 394 (62%) had 
surgery, most often decompressive laminectomy (320 of 394 [81%]). Stenosis 
surgeries improved health to a greater extent than nonoperative care (QALY gain, 
0.17 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.22]) at a cost of $77,600 (CI, $49,600 to $120,000) per 
QALY gained. Among 601 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, 368 (61%) 
had surgery, most including fusion (344 of 368 [93%]) and most with 
instrumentation (269 of 344 [78%]). Degenerative spondylolisthesis surgeries 
significantly improved health versus nonoperative care (QALY gain, 0.23 [CI, 
0.19 to 0.27]), at a cost of $115,600 (CI, $90,800 to $144,900) per QALY gained. 
RESULT OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Surgery cost markedly affected the value of 
surgery.
LIMITATION: The study used self-reported utilization data, 2-year time horizon, 
and as-treated analysis to address treatment nonadherence among randomly 
assigned participants.
CONCLUSION: The economic value of spinal stenosis surgery at 2 years compares 
favorably with many health interventions. Degenerative spondylolisthesis surgery 
is not highly cost-effective over 2 years but could show value over a longer 
time horizon.

Individual recognition is considered a complex process and, although it is 
believed to be widespread across animal taxa, the cognitive mechanisms 
underlying this ability are poorly understood. An essential feature of 
individual recognition in humans is that it is cross-modal, allowing the 
matching of current sensory cues to identity with stored information about that 
specific individual from other modalities. Here, we use a cross-modal expectancy 
violation paradigm to provide a clear and systematic demonstration of 
cross-modal individual recognition in a nonhuman animal: the domestic horse. 
Subjects watched a herd member being led past them before the individual went of 
view, and a call from that or a different associate was played from a 
loudspeaker positioned close to the point of disappearance. When horses were 
shown one associate and then the call of a different associate was played, they 
responded more quickly and looked significantly longer in the direction of the 
call than when the call matched the herd member just seen, an indication that 
the incongruent combination violated their expectations. Thus, horses appear to 
possess a cross-modal representation of known individuals containing unique 
auditory and visual/olfactory information. Our paradigm could provide a powerful 
way to study individual recognition across a wide range of species.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate a contemporary series of patients with incidental prostate 
cancer detected by transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and undergoing 
radical prostatectomy (RP). PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1998 and 2004, 1931 
patients had TURP for obstructive voiding symptoms and suspected BPH. Incidental 
prostate cancer was found in 104 (5.4%); 26 of these patients had a RP. The 
pathological staging and treatment of these patients were reviewed 
retrospectively and the follow-up results obtained. RESULTS Of the 26 patients 
who had RP, 17 had T1a and nine had T1b carcinoma of the prostate. After RP, six 
(35%) in the T1a group had no residual tumour (pT0) and 11 (65%) had pT2 cancer; 
the respective incidence in those with T1b was two and seven, with no pT3 
disease in either group. The preoperative Gleason grading did not correspond 
well with that after RP; 30% of the patients had upgraded Gleason scores and 42% 
showed either downgrading or no residual tumour, with 81% having Gleason scores 
of <7. After a median follow-up of 47 months, one patient is receiving hormonal 
therapy because of biochemical relapse. Conclusion Subsequent to stringent PSA 
testing and prostate biopsy when indicated, the rate of incidental prostate 
cancer is low. Furthermore, substantially many patients will harbour either no 
residual cancer or tumours with favourable characteristics in their RP 
specimens. However, there is currently no possibility to reliably predict the 
absence of aggressive prostate cancer after TURP, and thus safely recommend 
observation instead of further therapy. Therefore, patients with incidental 
prostate cancer need to be counselled individually. The decision 'treatment or 
no treatment' should be determined by the patients' age and life-expectancy, 
tumour aggressiveness in the TURP specimen and the prostate-specific antigen 
level after TURP.

BACKGROUND: Conventional prosthetic treatment of the edentulous and resorbed 
maxilla with zygomatic implants is a lengthy procedure. Today, immediate/early 
loading is a clinical reality and it is possible that such protocols could be 
used also for zygomatic implants.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present study is to report on the clinical outcomes of 
immediate/early loading of zygomatic implants for prosthetic rehabilitation of 
edentulous and severely resorbed maxillary cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 zygomatic and 129 regular implants were 
placed in 25 consecutive patients with total (N = 23) or partial (N = 2) 
edentulism in the maxilla. The patients had less than 4 mm of available bone 
height and width distal to the canine pillars. Straight and angulated abutments 
and impression copings were attached to the implants during surgery. Impressions 
and bite registrations were made and 19 patients received a bridge within 24 
hours and six patients were rehabilitated within 5 days. Screw-retained full 
arch restorations were used in 23 patients and cemented in 2 patients. The 
patients were instructed for a soft diet during 4 months. Follow-up controls 
were performed at 1, 4, and 12 months and thereafter annually. All patients were 
followed for at least 2 years and up to 5 years in function.
RESULTS: All zygomatic implants were stable during the follow-up (cumulative 
survival rate 100%). One regular implant placed in the pterygoid plate failed 
after 52 months of loading (cumulative survival rate 99.2%). Apart from fracture 
of one abutment screw and of anterior teeth in five patients, no other 
complications were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the present study, it is concluded that 
immediate/early loading is a viable treatment modality for prosthetic 
rehabilitation of the severely resorbed maxilla using zygomatic and conventional 
implants.

with fresh frozen allogenous bone.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have been performed to evaluate the clinical outcome 
of implants inserted into maxillae grafted with autogenous bone but few reports 
have focused on maxillae grafted with fresh-frozen allogenous bone (FFAB).
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the clinical 
outcome of implants installed in resorbed maxillae augmented with FFAB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 69 patients whom had been treated with FFAB 
grafts to their maxillae and implant placement 4 to 6 months later were 
retrospectively evaluated. Edentulism was total and partial in 22 and 47 cases, 
respectively. A total of 287 implants of various systems had been used. A life 
table analysis was performed. Marginal bone loss was calculated in radiographs.
RESULTS: Five of the 287 implants were lost, giving a survival rate (SVR) of 
98.3% over a mean follow-up time of 26 months. The marginal bone resorption at 
the implants was 1.68 mm (SD = 0.44) after 1 year and 1.85 mm (SD = 0.98) after 
4 years. The cumulative success rate based on defined criteria was 96% in the 
first year but decreased to 40% at 4 years because of marginal bone loss. The 
Kaplan-Meier algorithm demonstrated a better outcome for female patients, 
removable dentures, and total edentulism. No differences were detected among 
diameters, lengths, and implant site.
CONCLUSION: Implants placed in FFAB showed a high SVR similar to that reported 
in previous studies on maxillae grafted with autogenous iliac crest bone. 
Although our data point to more marginal bone loss in partially edentulous 
patients and for fixed prosthetic restorations, the use of FFAB for 
reconstruction of the atrophic jaw prior to implant placement can be considered 
as a reliable alternative to autogenous bone.

Regulation of forkhead transcription factor FoxO3a contributes to calorie 
restriction-induced prevention of Alzheimer's disease-type amyloid 
neuropathology and spatial memory deterioration.

Forkhead transcription factor FoxO3a, also known as DAF-16 in Caenorhabditis 
elegans, is a key regulator of the insulin receptor (IR)/insulin-like growth 
factor-I signaling pathway mediated extension of life span in worms and yeast. 
In this study, we report that calorie restriction (CR)-mediated activation of 
the IR signaling pathway leads to hyperphosphorylation of FoxO3a transcription 
factor and, consequently, its exclusion from the nucleus. This inactivation of 
FoxO3a activity is correlated with attenuation of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type 
amyloid neuropathology and with preservation of spatial reference memory in the 
Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Further, in vitro studies reveal that exogenous 
expression of viral, triple-mutant, constitutively active FoxO3a resulting in 
increased nuclear FoxO3a activity in primary neuron cultures derived from Tg2576 
mouse embryos, causally promotes AD amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) levels by 
inhibiting nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase activity, indicating the existence 
of an inverse correlation between FoxO3a activity and cerebral Abeta 
amyloidosis. Moreover, we report for the first time that the exclusion of the 
FoxO3a transcription factor from the nucleus in combination with inhibition of 
nuclear FoxO3a activity by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in response to CR is a 
mechanism resulting in the repression of Rho-associated protein kinase-1 gene 
expression, thereby activating nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase processing of 
the amyloid precursor protein and lowering Abeta generation. This study provides 
a novel metabolic pathway for prevention and/or treatment of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the fraction of remaining life lived with and without 
dementia among Australian males and females at later life.
METHOD: Analysis was performed by applying the life table technique that 
integrates mortality and morbidity statistics to derive a single population 
health indicator. Observed prevalence rates were used to calculate life 
expectancy with dementia.
RESULTS: At the age of 65 years, males are expected to live an additional 18 
years, of which 6% would be lived with dementia. Females surviving to 65 years, 
are likely to live a further 22 years, 9% of which is expected to be lived with 
dementia. At the age of 85 years, males live a further six years; one-sixth of 
this life spent with dementia. Females surviving to this age would live an 
additional seven years, with one-fourth of that life with dementia. The portion 
of life lived with dementia out of total remaining years of life increases with 
age at the rate of 20 to 30% every five years beyond the age of 65. CONCLUSION. 
The extension of life expectancy is associated with increased duration of life 
lived with dementia. As females live longer than males, they experience a 
greater impact of dementia.

A synthesized model of trait hope (Snyder 1994, 2002) and trait optimism 
(Scheier & Carver, 1985) is proposed. In this model hope and optimism are 
conceptualized as facets of an overarching trait called goal attitude. 
Structural equation modeling is used to test the plausibility of the proposed 
model in a sample of 345 students in a university psychology course who 
completed the Adult Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1991) and the Life Orientation 
Test-Revised (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994). The proposed model shows 
acceptable fit to the observed data. The synthesized model is used to examine 
the unique and common influences of hope and optimism on grade expectancy and 
academic performance in 312 students who completed the course. The results show 
that hope uniquely influenced students' grade expectancies, whereas optimism did 
not. In turn, grade expectancies influenced academic performance. Neither hope 
nor optimism had a unique, direct influence on academic performance. In 
contrast, the shared aspect of hope and optimism (i.e., goal attitude) had a 
direct influence on academic performance.

How do medical students value health on the EQ-5D? Evaluation of hypothetical 
health states compared to the general population.

BACKGROUND: Medical students gain a particular perspective on health problems 
during their medical education. This article describes how medical students 
value 10 hypothetical health states using the EQ-5D compared to the general 
population.
METHODS: Based on a sample of 161 medical students (male: 41%) we compared 
valuations of 10 hypothetical EQ-5D health states collected in face to face 
interviews with the valuations of the general population. Self-reported health 
on the EQ-5D was also collected.
RESULTS: Every third health state was valuated higher by the medical students 
compared to data of the general population. The differences were independent of 
the severity of the hypothetical health state. Concerning the self-reported 
health, the majority of the students (66%) reported no problems in the five 
EQ-5D domains (EQ-5D VAS M = 87.3 +/- 9.6 SD). However, when compared to an 
age-matched sample the medical students show significantly more problems in the 
area of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
CONCLUSION: Medical students have a tendency to value health states higher than 
the general public. Medical professionals should be continuously aware that 
their assessment of the patients health state can differ from the valuations of 
the general population.

North-western Patagonia.

BACKGROUND: In the present study we have investigated the cultural transmission 
of two types of traditional plant knowledge in two communities of North-western 
Patagonia, Argentina. In the Pilcaniyeu community, we studied the transmission 
of traditional knowledge related to horticultural practices in home-gardens, 
greenhouses and gardens; while in the community of Cuyin Manzano, we studied 
wild plant gathering customs.
METHODS: Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted by means of semi-structured 
interviews, in which we investigated which plants are used, at what life history 
phase was learned, modes of transmission and who the principal transmitters were 
in childhood and adulthood. In both communities, each of this three aspects 
related to cultural transmission were categorized and the frequencies of each 
category were obtained. The total number of species recorded in each community 
was also calculated. Frequencies were analyzed with the Chi-square test of 
independence.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In both communities, transmission of traditional plant 
knowledge begins at an early age, as a family custom, in which women play a 
predominant role. Wild plant use and horticultural knowledge continue to be 
learned during adulthood. This was particularly registered associated with 
horticultural learning, which receives greater influence from extension agents 
who are introducing new practices and technology. This outside influence, which 
implies novelty, could imply syncretism but also traditional knowledge loss.
CONCLUSION: Given the remarkable acculturation processes occurring at present in 
rural communities of Northwestern Patagonia, it might be of vital importance to 
document traditional knowledge of ancient practices. Moreover, it could be 
interesting to share our results with both populations in order to encourage 
participatory activities within the communities which could enhance traditional 
knowledge horizontal transmission, particularly among elder adults and 
youngsters.

Vasculitis in rheumatoid arthritis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the occurrence and pathophysiology of vasculitis 
in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), describe the epidemiology and clinical features, 
and provide a therapeutic perspective.
RECENT FINDINGS: With improved control of RA over the past two decades, the risk 
of severe outcomes such as vasculitis may be decreasing. Rheumatoid vasculitis 
continues to be associated with longstanding, erosive, seropositive disease, and 
it has recently been shown to be more frequent among patients with antibodies to 
cyclic citrullinated peptides. Apart from circulating immune complexes, 
expansion of cytotoxic CD28null T cells and circulating proinflammatory 
cytokines also play a role in the pathogenesis. The role of agents directed 
against the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the occurrence and management of 
rheumatoid vasculitis remains unclear, as rheumatoid vasculitis may be both 
associated with and treated with anti-TNF agents, once it has appeared.
SUMMARY: Vasculitis in RA is generally associated with longstanding disease, has 
an important impact on a patient's well being, and markedly influences patient
