BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study provides estimates of 
deaths, years of life lost (YLL), years of life lived with disability (YLD), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to 249 causes of death, 315 diseases 
and injuries, and 79 behavioral, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risk 
factors in 195 countries, territories, and regions by sex and 20 age categories 
in 195 countries and regions since 1990. In this study, we aimed to present the 
burden of road traffic injuries (RTIs) in Iran and 15 surrounding countries in 
1990-2016.
METHODS: The standard Cause of Death Ensemble modeling (CODEm) is used to 
estimate deaths due to all causes of injury by age, sex, country and year. A 
range of 27 causes is used for estimating non-fatal health outcomes based on 
inpatient and outpatient datasets using DisMod-MR 2.0. Disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) estimate quantify the total burden of years lost due to premature 
death or disability and was computed by summing the fatal burden and non-fatal 
burden associated with a cause (i.e., YLL+YLD).
RESULTS: In 2016, age-standardized transport injuries in Iran accounted for 35.6 
(UI: 29.64-43.44) deaths per 100000 compared to 60.8 (UI: 51.04-72.49) in 1990. 
Transport injury became the fourth leading cause of death in Iran in 2016, up 
from the 5th leading cause of death in 1990. The burden of RTIs was mainly 
caused by motor vehicles and motorcycles and mostly affected the economically 
productive age groups (15-49), males and children, especially those at school 
age. Afghanistan with 59.14 deaths (52.09-66.8) and UAE with 53.71 deaths 
(36.59-72.77) had the largest transport injury death rates per 100000. From 1990 
to 2016, Iran had -2.06 annual percent change in transport death rates. The 
lowest annual percent change is reported for Turkmenistan at -3.43. While 
Pakistan, UAE and Qatar had the highest annual percent change in transport 
injury. Across all countries, the observed-to-expected ratios for transport 
injury death rates varied considerably in 2016.The UAE had the largest 
age-standardized ratios of observed-to-expected rate (2.93), followed by Oman 
(2.39), Saudi Arabia (2.23), Afghanistan (2.04) and Iran (1.95).
CONCLUSIONS: RTIs continue to be a public health burden in Iran and its 
neighboring countries, even though, there is evidence for decline in RTIs across 
all countries except Pakistan. The most frequent sub-causes of death and injury 
are the motor vehicle, motorcycle, and pedestrian injuries. The most vulnerable 
road users are children and young adults.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy in Western societies does not necessarily 
mean better quality of life. To improve resources management, management systems 
have been set up in health systems to stratify patients according to morbidity, 
such as Clinical Risk Groups (CRG). The main objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of multimorbidity on health-related quality of life (HRQL) 
in primary care.
METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study, based on a representative 
random sample (n = 306) of adults from a health district (N = 32,667) in east 
Spain (Valencian Community), was conducted in 2013. Multimorbidity was measured 
by stratifying the population with the CRG system into nine mean health statuses 
(MHS). HRQL was assessed by EQ-5D dimensions and the EQ Visual Analogue Scale 
(EQ VAS). The effect of the CRG system, age and gender on the utility value and 
VAS was analysed by multiple linear regression. A predictive analysis was run by 
binary logistic regression with all the sample groups classified according to 
the CRG system into the five HRQL dimensions by taking the "healthy" group as a 
reference. Multivariate logistic regression studied the joint influence of the 
nine CRG system MHS, age and gender on the five EQ-5D dimensions.
RESULTS: Of the 306 subjects, 165 were female (mean age of 53). The most 
affected dimension was pain/discomfort (53%), followed by anxiety/depression 
(42%). The EQ-5D utility value and EQ VAS progressively lowered for the MHS with 
higher morbidity, except for MHS 6, more affected in the five dimensions, save 
self-care, which exceeded MHS 7 patients who were older, and MHS 8 and 9 
patients, whose condition was more serious. The CRG system alone was the 
variable that best explained health problems in HRQL with 17%, which rose to 21% 
when associated with female gender. Age explained only 4%.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that the multimorbidity groups obtained by 
the CRG classification system can be used as an overall indicator of HRQL. These 
utility values can be employed for health policy decisions based on 
cost-effectiveness to estimate incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
with routinely e-health data. Patients under 65 years with multimorbidity 
perceived worse HRQL than older patients or disease severity. Knowledge of 
multimorbidity with a stronger impact can help primary healthcare doctors to pay 
attention to these population groups.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is associated with a 
substantial Quality of life impact on patients that has not been so far measured 
with a generic validated instrument.
METHODS: A prospective study was performed in 7 French acute-care settings in 
patients presenting with a bacteriologically-confirmed CDI. The EQ-5D-3 L was 
filled in by patients at 7 ± 2 days after CDI diagnosis to describe their state 
of health at that date as well as their state of health immediately before the 
CDI episode (baseline). Individual utility decrement was obtained by subtracting 
the corresponding utilities. The Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) loss was 
calculated by multiplying the days spent from baseline to the date of the 
interview, by the decrement of utility. A multivariate analysis of variance of 
the utility decrement according to CDI and patients characteristics was 
performed.
RESULTS: Eighty patients were enrolled (mean age: 69.4 years, 55% females). The 
utility scores dropped from a mean 0.542 (SD: 0.391) at baseline to 0.050 (SD: 
0.404) during the CDI episode with a mean adjusted utility decrement of 0.492 
(SD: 0.398) point. This decrement increased significantly with CDI severity (Zar 
score ≥ 3) (p = 0.001), in patients with a positive baseline utility 
(p = 0.032), in women as compared to men (p = 0.041) and in patients aged more 
than 65 years (p = 0.041). No association with the Charlson index was found. The 
associated QALY loss not integrating the excess mortality was 0.028 (SD: 0.053).
CONCLUSIONS: The impact on quality of life of CDI episodes is major and 
translates in a substantial QALY loss despite their short duration.

BACKGROUND: Up to 75% of inpatients with mental disorders smoke, and their life 
expectancy is decreased by up to 25 years compared to the general population. 
Hospitalized patients without monitoring after discharge quickly return to 
prehospitalization levels of tobacco use. The aim of the 061 QuitMental study is 
to assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent and motivational telephone-based 
intervention to stop smoking through a quitline addressed to smokers discharged 
from mental health hospital wards.
METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial, single blinded, will include 
2:1 allocation to the intervention group (IG) and the control group (CG). The IG 
will receive telephone assistance to quit smoking (including psychological and 
psychoeducational support, and pharmacological treatment advice if required) 
proactively for 12 months, and the CG will receive only brief advice after 
discharge. The sample size, calculated with an expected difference of 15 points 
on smoking abstinence between groups (IG, 20% and CG, 5%), α = 0.05, β = 0.10, 
and 20% loss, will be 334 participants (IG) and 176 participants (CG). 
Participants are adult smokers discharged from psychiatric units of five acute 
hospitals. Measurements include dependent variables (self-reported 7-day point 
prevalence smoking abstinence (carbon monoxide verified), duration of 
abstinence, number of quit attempts, motivation, and self-efficacy to quit) and 
independent variables (age, sex, and psychiatric diagnoses). In data analysis, 
IG and CG data will be compared at 48 h and 1, 6, and 12 months post discharge. 
Multivariate logistic regression (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval) of 
dependent variables adjusted for potential confounding variables will be 
performed. The number needed to treat to achieve one abstinence outcome will be 
calculated. We will compare the abstinence rate of enrolled patients between 
groups.
DISCUSSION: This trial evaluates an innovative format of a quitline for smokers 
with severe mental disorders regardless of their motivation to quit. If 
effective, the pragmatic nature of the study will permit transfer to routine 
clinical practice in the National Health System.

BACKGROUND: Road traffic deaths are a substantial barrier to population health 
improvement in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In South Africa, 
the road-traffic injury mortality (RTM) rate of 27 per 100 000 population is 
twice the global average, over 60% of which are alcohol-related. Recent US 
studies suggest the Uber ride-sharing service may reduce alcohol-related RTM, 
however RTM burden in the USA is relatively low and transport behaviours differ 
from LMICs.
METHODS: Using certification data from all deaths occurring in South Africa in 
the years 2010-2014 (n=2 498 216), we investigated the relative change in weekly 
road traffic-related death counts between provinces which received Uber services 
(beginning in 2013) against those that did not using a difference-in-differences 
approach.
RESULTS: Weekly road traffic-related deaths in provinces with Uber were lower 
following Uber introduction than in comparison provinces without Uber. The 
effect size was larger in the province which had Uber the longest (Gauteng) and 
among young adult males (aged 17-39 years). However, the absolute effects were 
very small (<2 deaths per year) and may coincide with seasonal variation.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings did not support either an increase or large 
decrease in province-level road traffic-related deaths associated with Uber 
introduction to South Africa. More localised investigations in South Africa and 
other LMICs are needed.

In Germany, the significant increase of healthcare provision and service use in 
recent decades has not resulted in a decreasing prevalence of mental 
disorders.Three explanations for this phenomenon are considered: 1) prevention 
and the healthcare system are insufficient and ineffective, 2) the success of 
the healthcare service is masked by growing morbidity due to increasing societal 
risks, and 3) a fundamental shift towards a psychological culture accounts for 
an increasing perception and treatment of mental disorders and their symptoms at 
the same time. In order to review these three theoretical approaches, results 
from population-based health surveys and healthcare research in Germany as well 
as the international debate are presented and discussed.The present results 
provide evidence for each of the three explanations: 1) problems with 
implementation of preventive actions and access to healthcare services are well 
documented, 2) influences of the multifaceted development of risk factors on the 
prevalence and disease burden of mental disorders cannot be ruled out, and 
3) a growing mental health literacy implies that problems (in everyday life) are 
currently more often interpreted and treated psychologically.For the purpose of 
evaluating changes in the healthcare system, not only should the prevalence of 
mental disorders be considered, but also incidence (and their potential 
reduction by preventive measures) as well as indicators of need for treatment 
(i. e. functional impairment) and mortality (i. e. suicides and reduced life 
expectancy).

The removal of toxic compounds (azo dyes) from dyeing wastewater was 
investigated by an environmentally friendly activated carbon produced from solid 
waste generated in the tannery process, the cattle hair (CHW), activated with 
H3PO4 (AC-CHW), suggesting a life cycle extension for this material from leather 
processing. Preliminary tests with aqueous solutions containing Acid Brown 414 
(AB-414) and Acid Orange 142 (AO-142) removed 71.06% and 73.05%, respectively. 
The activated carbon was characterized by zeta potential (ZP), functional groups 
(FTIR), elemental composition, sorbent specific surface area, and pore size 
distribution (BET/BJH). The specific surface area showed low values when 
compared to commercial activated carbon, but average pore diameter was higher, 
which facilitates the adsorption of larger and complex molecules, such as those 
present in real wastewaters. Through SEM and FTIR, the presence of the toxic 
compounds studied in the AC-CHW after sorption process was observed, where the 
results indicated that the functional groups of -CH=CH- participated in the 
removal process for these compounds. The removal efficiency obtained with AC-CHW 
was 51.94% and 49.73% for the dyeing wastewater containing AB-414 and AO-142, 
respectively. The obtained results open a promising via to use AC-CHW as 
efficient eco-friendly sorbent for the treatment of leather wastewater.

Proteins have a strong influence on the phenotype and their aberrant expression 
leads to diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA sequences which 
posttranscriptionally regulate protein expression. This regulation is driven by 
miRNAs acting as recognition sequences for their target mRNAs within a larger 
regulatory machinery. A miRNA can have many target mRNAs and an mRNA can be 
targeted by many miRNAs which makes it difficult to experimentally discover all 
miRNA-mRNA interactions. Therefore, computational methods have been developed 
for miRNA detection and miRNA target prediction. An abundance of available 
computational tools makes selection difficult. Additionally, interactions are 
not currently the focus of investigation although they more accurately define 
the regulation than pre-miRNA detection or target prediction could perform 
alone. We define an interaction including the miRNA source and the mRNA target. 
We present computational methods allowing the investigation of these 
interactions as well as how they can be used to extend regulatory pathways. 
Finally, we present a list of points that should be taken into account when 
investigating miRNA-mRNA interactions. In the future, this may lead to better 
understanding of functional interactions which may pave the way for disease 
marker discovery and design of miRNA-based drugs.

[The medical-dental interactions scanner: an Electronic Health Record-integrated 
quality and safety module for medical-dental interactions].

[Article in Dutch; Abstract available in Dutch from the publisher]

Rademacher WMH, Aziz Y, van Diermen DE, Rozema FR.

Dental professionals will be confronted more frequently with 
medically compromised patients due to an increasing life expectancy in 
Western countries. The patients' systemic diseases and medication usage can both 
have consequences for oral health and dental treatment. It is often impossible 
to have all medical-dental interactions handy in the dental practice. To support 
the dental professional in providing safe healthcare, a tool has been developed. 
The medical-dental interactions scanner supports both patients and dental 
professionals in taking a patient's medical history and linking that information 
to the available literature. By that means, it is possible for the caregiver to 
provide patient-specific recommendations concerning possible adverse effects of 
medicaments,intra-oral manifestations of systemic diseases and measures to 
prevent medical emergencies.

Publisher: Door de vergrijzing zal de mondzorgverlener steeds vaker 
geconfronteerd worden met medisch gecompromitteerde patiënten. Zowel de 
lichamelijke aandoeningen als het medicijngebruik kunnen consequenties hebben 
voor de mondgezondheid of de tandheelkundige behandeling. In de praktijk is het 
vaak ondoenlijk om alle medisch tandheelkundige interacties paraat te hebben. Om 
de mondzorgverlener te ondersteunen bij het leveren van veilige zorg, is er een 
hulpmiddel ontwikkeld. De medisch tandheelkundige interacties-scanner 
ondersteunt zowel patiënt als mondzorgverlener bij het afnemen van de medische 
anamnese en koppelt de daarbij verkregen informatie aan beschikbare literatuur. 
Hierdoor wordt het mogelijk om de zorgverlener te voorzien van 
patiënt-specifieke aanbevelingen over potentiële medicatiebijwerkingen, 
intraorale manifestaties van lichamelijke aandoeningen en het voorkomen van 
acute situaties.

Center, Goyang, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have been conducted regarding people with 
disabilities, however no studies have estimated the disease burden due to 
premature death. As such, we aimed to compare the years of life lost (YLLs) due 
to premature death between a population with disabilities and the total 
population of Korea.
METHODS: To calculate the YLLs in people with disabilities, we combined 
disability registration data from the 2002-2011 Ministry of Health and Welfare 
of Korea and the causes of mortality data by Statistics Korea for 3,158,231 
people.
RESULTS: YLLs of people with disabilities were 517,337, which accounted for 
23.4% of YLLs of the total population. YLLs per 100,000 people with disabilities 
were approximately 3.8 times higher than those in the total Korean population. 
Ischemic stroke was associated with the highest YLLs per 100,000 people, 
followed by ischemic heart disease, hemorrhagic, and other non-ischemic stroke, 
diabetes mellitus, and self-harm. Among individuals with physical disabilities, 
ischemic heart disease was associated with the highest YLLs. For intellectual 
disability, epilepsy contributed to the most YLLs. For individuals with mental 
disability, self-harm was the largest contributor to YLLs.
CONCLUSION: The burden of disease was higher in the population with disabilities 
than that in the general population. Cardiovascular diseases and cancer had a 
higher burden of disease than did other diseases in the population with 
disabilities; thus, overall, non-communicable diseases have a higher burden of 
disease than communicable diseases or injuries in the population with 
disabilities than in the general population.

2-Amino-4H-chromene derivatives possess anticancer property proved on different 
in vivo and in vitro models of malignancies such breast, nasopharyngeal, 
bladder, ovary carcinomas, astrocytoma, and osteosarcoma. We assumed it might be 
effective to apply one of the derivatives as promising approach to lung 
carcinoma treatment. to evaluate how novel 4-aryl substituted 
2-amino-4H-chromene derivative AX-554 impacts tumor growth and progression, as 
well as possible mechanisms for anticancer effect development on in vivo 
patient-derived heterotopic xenograft model of lung carcinoma in mice. This was 
an experimental in vivo study. 40 nu/nu BALB/c female mice were randomly 
allocated into four equal groups: Intact, control, reference, and main group. 
Animals of three latter groups were ingrafted with human-derived lung 
adenocarcinoma. Antitumor and antimetastatic action of AX-554 novel 
aminochromone derivative as a substance were studied. Mice survival was 
registered. Kinase of anaplastic lymphoma (ALK), tubulin Beta-3 (TUBB3), and 
c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) concentrations in the prime tumor 
nodes homogenates were determined by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay. Dannet's parametric criterion and the nonparametric exact Fisher test 
were used. The normality of the distribution was determined using ANOVA. The 
survival curve was analyzed using Gehan's criterion with the Yates's correction. 
Aminochromone derivative possesses an inhibitory effect on human lung 
adenocarcinoma transplanted into nu/nu BALB/c female mice, as well as 
significant antimetastatic activity. About 50 mg/kg/day AX-554 intragastric 
course increases animals' life expectancy of more than 3.3 times when compared 
with the control and induces remission in 60% of cases. The anticancer effect of 
the derivative is due to anti-ALK-mediated activation of tumor cells apoptosis 
and suppression TUBB3-dependent cell proliferation.

BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain significantly reduces an individual's quality of 
life and places a significant economic burden on society. As such, many 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) have been published for treatments available 
for neuropathic pain.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this systematic review was to provide a 
detailed summary of the estimates of cost-effectiveness from published CEAs 
comparing available treatments for neuropathic pain. The secondary objectives 
were to identify the key drivers of cost-effectiveness and to assess the quality 
of published CEAs in neuropathic pain.
METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL and seven other databases 
to identify CEAs reporting the costs, health benefits (e.g., quality-adjusted 
life-years or disability-adjusted life-years) and summary statistics, such as 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, of treatments for neuropathic pain. We 
excluded studies reporting diseases other than neuropathic pain, those for which 
the full text was not available (e.g., conference abstracts), studies not 
written in English or not published in peer-reviewed journals, and narrative 
reviews, editorials and opinion papers. Titles and abstract reviews, full-text 
reviews, and data extraction were all performed by two independent reviewers, 
with disagreement resolved by a third reviewer. Mean costs, health benefits, and 
summary statistics were reported and qualitatively compared across studies, 
stratified by time horizon. Drivers of cost-effectiveness were assessed using 
reported one-way sensitivity analyses. The quality of all included studies was 
evaluated using the Tufts CEA Registry Quality Score and study reporting using 
the CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) 
checklist.
RESULTS: A total of 22 studies were identified and included in this systematic 
review. Included studies were heterogeneous in the treatments compared, 
methodology and design, perspectives, and time horizons considered, making 
cross-study comparisons difficult. No single treatment was consistently the most 
cost-effective across all studies, but tricyclic antidepressants were the 
preferred treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $US50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year in several studies with a short time horizon and a US 
payer perspective. Among the 14 studies reporting one-way sensitivity analyses, 
drivers of cost-effectiveness included utility values for health states and the 
likelihood of pain relief with treatment. The quality of the identified CEAs was 
moderate to high, and overall reporting largely met CHEERS recommendations.
LIMITATIONS: To assess drivers of cost-effectiveness and quality, 
we only included studies with the full text available and thus excluded some 
CEAs that reported cost-effectiveness results. The heterogeneity of the included 
studies meant that the study results could not be synthesized and comparison 
across studies was limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Though many pulished studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness 
of treatments for neuropathic pain, significant heterogeneity between CEAs 
prevented synthesis of the results. Standardized methodology and improved 
reporting would allow for more reliable comparisons across studies.

BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are a common benign tumor and can be symptomatic, 
necessitating resection. Surgical myomectomy is an effective treatment option 
with a risk of disseminating occult uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS), creating a 
need for an effective presurgical screening protocol. Clinical collaboration 
with contrast-enhanced MRI including T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can 
be utilized as a screening exam.
PURPOSE: To review the accuracy and feasibility of an interdisciplinary 
prospective contrast-enhanced MRI pelvis with DWI screening system for LMS prior 
to fibroid resection.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective cohort study.
POPULATION: In all, 1960 adult female patients aged 18-87 undergoing screening 
MRI pelvis prior to uterine fibroid resection.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: T1 and T2 -weighted imaging, DWI, and contrast-enhanced 
images were acquired at 1.5 T and 3.0 T.
ASSESSMENT: Each radiologist at the time of clinical study prospectively 
designated a confidence level of presence of LMS in the impression, which was 
reviewed retrospectively. A separate retrospective evaluation of the 
histologically proven LMS and the false positives was performed for the presence 
of five MRI features of LMS including low ADC values, intermediate/high T2 
signal intensity, irregular margins, hemorrhage, and necrosis. A preliminary 
cost-effectiveness analysis was performed, comparing the costs of treatment of 
uterine fibroids with vs. without a collaborative screening protocol using MRI.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and 
negative predictive value were obtained from the prospective evaluations. 
Student's t-tests were used to compare demographics and apparent diffusion 
coefficient values between LMS and false-positive results.
RESULTS: We prospectively identified LMS patients with 100% sensitivity and 97% 
specificity. Preliminary cost analysis demonstrated that the MR screening 
protocol increased life expectancy by 0.04 years at a cost of $12,937 per 
life-year gained.
DATA CONCLUSION: MRI is an effective and potentially economic screening test, 
especially with standardized reporting and coordination with clinicians.

The role of MRI in diagnostics, prognostics, and discoveries in basic sciences 
has been well established. However, access to this life-saving technology is 
largely restricted to countries in upper-middle to high-income groups. In this 
article, we collate recent global MR scanner density data and group them into 
six geographical regions based on the WHO classification. We then analyze these 
data with respect to demographic factors such as population size, life 
expectancy, the percentage of internet users, and World Bank income grouping. We 
map these demographic factors to five dimensions or characteristics of 
accessible MRI, adapting definitions from the healthcare literature. With this 
background, the study then reviews recent demonstrations of accessible MRI 
categorized based on main magnetic field strength. We describe demonstrated 
examples for each of these categories, ranging from ultralow-field to 
ultrahigh-field MRI. Lastly, we review MR methods and associated developments 
impacting accessible MRI such as increasing/augmenting MR awareness and local 
expertise, incorporating hardware-cognizant methods, rapid quantitative imaging, 
and leveraging innovations from adjacent fields. Level of Evidence: 5 Technical

ADHD risk genes involved in dopamine signaling and metabolism are associated 
with reduced estimated life expectancy at young adult follow-up in hyperactive 
and control children.

ADHD is associated with an elevated risk of mortality and reduced estimated life 
expectancy (ELE) by adulthood. Reduced life expectancy is substantially related 
to the trait of behavioral disinhibition; a correlate of both ADHD and of 
several dopamine genes related to dopamine signaling and metabolism. We 
therefore hypothesized that several ADHD risk genes related to dopamine might 
also be predictive of reduced ELE. Using a longitudinal study of 131 hyperactive 
children and 71 control cases followed to young adulthood, we examined whether 
several polymorphisms involving DRD4, DAT1, and DBH were related to ELE. The 
homozygous 9/9 allele of DAT1 and the heterozygous allele of DBH TaqI were 
associated with 5- and 2-year reductions, respectively, in total ELE. They did 
not operate on ELE through any relationships to ADHD specifically or behavioral 
disinhibition more generally. Instead, they showed links to alcohol use (DBH), 
reduced education, smoking, and reduced exercise (DAT1) employed in the 
computation of ELE. We conclude that polymorphisms of two dopamine genes are 
linked to reductions in ELE independently of their association with ADHD.

Molds are one of the most important spoilage organisms on cheese which can lead 
to economic loss as well as raising public health concerns due to the production 
of mycotoxins. This study investigates the use of ɛ-polylysine as natural 
antimicrobial to inhibit fungal growth. The minimal inhibitory concentrations 
and minimal fungicidal concentrations of ɛ-polylysine were determined against 
Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nordicum, and Penicillium solitum. Then, 
polylysine was tested as surface antimicrobial for the preservation of 
mozzarella slice cheese inoculated with these Penicillium spp. and stored in 
plastic trays during 25 days. The minimal inhibitory concentrations calculated 
for the three fungi tested were of 60 mg/l whereas the minimal fungicidal 
concentrations detected were of 125-10,000 mg/l. The shelf life observed for the 
control experiments was of 15 days, and just using the ɛ-polylysine at 0.00625, 
0.0125, and 0.025% was evidenced a shelf life increment in comparison with the 
control of 1-3 days.

[Where does the Preston curve lead us?].

World Bank and Russian Federal State Statistics Service data were used to 
analyze cross-country correlations between life expectancy (LE) and per capita 
gross domestic product (pcGDP). The resulting world trend (Preston curve) as of 
2015 was compared with the trend revealed by plotting regional LE vs. pcGDP 
related to the major administrative areas of the Russian Federation (RF). 
Besides that, correlations between the same parameters related to different 
years, from 1960 to 2015, were examined in each of several selected countries 
representing the upper and lower extremes of pcGDP and LE. The same has been 
done with per capita health care expenditures (pcHCE) vs. LE. In all cases, the 
points related to RF are found significantly lower the respective regression 
lines (Preston curves) built based on all points. The LE vs. pcGDP and LE vs. 
pcHCE plots and their extrapolations built based on data related to different 
years in the same country run markedly lower in the case of RF compared with 
other countries, including Tajikistan and the Republic of Congo. At the same 
time, the proportion between pcGDP and pcHCE has been shown to be the same 
throughout all years and all countries. Taken together, these observations 
suggest that the effectiveness of investing the available resources into LE, 
that is in human life quality, is markedly lower in Russia compared not only 
with Finland and Japan, where pcGDP and pcHCE are several times greater than in 
RF, but also with Congo and Tajikistan, where these parameters are several fold 
smaller, than in RF. This means that by merely increasing pcGDP and pcHCE it is 
impossible to increase LE in Russia above 80 years declared a national priority. 
Identifying the factors responsible for the above disproportions is beyond the 
scope of the present paper. However, the mere awareness of their existence is 
essential as an incentive to take special efforts aimed at the identification 
and neutralization of these factors.

Publisher: По данным Всемирного банка и Росстата проанализированы связи между 
ожидаемой продолжительностью жизни (ОПЖ) и валовым национальным (внутренним) 
продуктом (ВНП) на душу населения. Сопоставлены тенденции, выявляемые при 
сравнении разных стран (кривая Престона) и регионов РФ в 2015 г. Кроме того, 
рассмотрены связи между ВНП и ОПЖ, выявляемые при сопоставлении этих данных в 
разные годы (с 1960 по 2015 г.), по отдельности в РФ и странах со значительно 
более высокими или низкими этими показателями. То же проделано для расходов на 
здравоохранение на душу населения (РЗО). Во всех случаях те точки, которые 
относятся к РФ, лежат заметно ниже линий регрессии ОПЖ на ВНП или на РЗО, 
построенных по всем точкам. Графики зависимости ОПЖ от ВНП и РЗО, построенные по 
величинам в разные годы, и их экстраполяции на более высокие значения ВНП и РЗО 
идут для РФ ниже, чем такие же графики и экстраполяции для других стран, включая 
Конго и Таджикистан. Поскольку, как показано, соотношение между ВНП и РЗО во 
всех странах и по всем годам остается одним и тем же, в целом получается, что 
эффективность вложения доступных ресурсов в ОПЖ, то есть в качество жизни, в РФ 
была и остается существенно ниже, чем не только в Финляндии и Японии, где ВНП в 
несколько раз превышает российский, но в Таджикистане и Конго, где ВНП в 
несколько раз ниже, чем в РФ. Это значит, что повышение ВНП и РЗО в РФ не может 
само по себе вывести ОПЖ на заявленный в качестве национального приоритета 
уровень не ниже 80 лет, если не ликвидировать диспропорции, ставящие 
фундаментальные препятствия на пути к этой цели. Определение их природы выходит 
за рамки этой статьи. Но без осознания самого факта их наличия не может быть 
стимула к их идентификации и поискам способов их преодоления.

[Prospects for the search for peptides for specific regulation of aging.].

We propose a hypothesis that the causes of aging are not random events, but 
regular processes due to the dysfunction of species-specific transposons. The 
hypothesis is justified by the fact that the average life expectancy differs 
significantly between species. In addition, genomes of different species differ 
in the composition and arrangement of transposons in them, which control the 
differentiation of cells in different tissues and at different stages of 
development. We presented literature data confirming this assumption and 
substantiating the key role of transposons in regulating gene expression in 
ontogenesis. In the terminally differentiated cells, the mechanisms of the 
silencing of mobile elements are activated, which are depleted, which leads to 
the dysfunction of gene-regulated regulatory networks controlled by transposons, 
the aging and development of age-associated pathology. Mobile elements are 
capable of transposing into strictly defined genomic loci, transcribed into 
functional RNAs that are translated into peptides. We propose that the detection 
of changes in the activity of specific mobile elements associated with aging 
through the analysis of non-coding RNA of transposon origin can be the basis for 
developing ways to increase life expectancy and targeted therapy for age-related 
pathologies, including malignant tumors. A promising direction in this respect 
may be the study of peptides that affect the expression of specific transposons 
and non-coding RNAs.

Publisher: Различие между видами в средней продолжительности жизни и в составе

которых играет роль в управлении процессом дифференцировки клеток, позволяет 
предположить, что в основе старения лежат закономерные процессы, обусловленные 
дисфункцией специфических для видов мобильных элементов. Представлены 
литературные данные, подтверждающие данное предположение и ключевую роль 
транспозонов в регуляции экспрессии генов в онтогенезе. В терминально 
дифференцированных клетках активируются механизмы сайленсинга мобильных 
элементов, которые истощаются, что приводит к дисфункции управляемых 
транспозонами генных регуляторных сетей, старению и развитию ассоциированной с 
возрастом патологии. Транспозоны способны перемещаться в строго определенные 
локусы генома, транскрибироваться в функциональные РНК, которые транслируются в 
пептиды. Предполагается, что выявление изменений активности ассоциированных со 
старением специфических мобильных элементов путем анализа некодирующих РНК 
транспозонного происхождения может стать основой для разработки способов 
увеличения продолжительности жизни и таргетной терапии ассоциированной с
