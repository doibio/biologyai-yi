OBJECTIVES: The phase 3 trial, Serine Protease Inhibitor Boceprevir and 
PegIntron/Rebetol-2 (RESPOND-2), demonstrated that the addition of boceprevir 
(BOC) to peginterferon-ribavirin (PR) resulted in significantly higher rates of 
sustained virologic response (SVR) in previously treated patients with chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1 infection as compared with PR alone. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of treatment with BOC in previously treated 
patients with chronic hepatitis C in the United States using treatment-related 
data from RESPOND-2 and PROVIDE studies.
METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model to project the burden of HCV 
disease, lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life-years associated with PR and 
two BOC-based therapies-response-guided therapy (BOC/RGT) and fixed-duration 
therapy for 48 weeks (BOC/PR48). We estimated treatment-related inputs 
(efficacy, adverse events, and discontinuations) from clinical trials and 
obtained disease progression rates, costs, and quality-of-life data from 
published studies. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
for BOC-based regimens as studied in RESPOND-2, as well as by patient's prior 
response to treatment and the IL-28B genotype.
RESULTS: BOC-based regimens were projected to reduce the lifetime incidence of 
liver-related complications by 43% to 53% in comparison with treatment with PR. 
The ICER of BOC/RGT in comparison with that of PR was $30,200, and the ICER of 
BOC/PR48 in comparison with that of BOC/RGT was $91,500. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000, the probabilities of BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 being the 
preferred option were 0.74 and 0.25, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients previously treated for chronic HCV genotype-1 
infection, BOC was projected to increase quality-adjusted life-years and reduce 
the lifetime incidence of liver complications. In addition, BOC-based therapies 
were projected to be cost-effective in comparison with PR alone at commonly used 
willingness-to-pay thresholds.

Priority preferences: "end of life" does not matter, but total life does.

There is increasing evidence that the social value of an incremental health gain 
depends on patient characteristics, such as their age and their prognosis. This 
article presents an analytical framework to illustrate how a disease splits our 
life expectancy into 1) past health (age), 2) prognosis untreated, 3) gain from 
treatment, and 4) incurable loss. A Norwegian population sample was asked to 
make pairwise choices and prioritize hypothetical patients who differed in terms 
of age (30, 50, and 70 years old), remaining lifetime without treatment (1, 3, 
and 10 years), and increase in remaining lifetime with treatment (1 month, 3 
months, 1 year, and 3 years). Their preferences reveal strong support for the 
"fair innings" argument that total lifetime inequalities should be reduced. 
Differences in patients' remaining lifetime without treatment did not matter, 
implying little support for the "end-of-life" argument that a short life 
expectancy makes patients entitled to preferential treatment.

Complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response as surrogate outcomes 
for overall survival in first-line treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia: a 
case study for technology appraisal on the basis of surrogate outcomes evidence.

OBJECTIVES: In 2012, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
assessed dasatinib, nilotinib, and standard-dose imatinib as first-line 
treatment of chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Licensing of 
these alternative treatments was based on randomized controlled trials assessing 
complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) at 12 
months as primary end points. We use this case study to illustrate the 
validation of CCyR and MMR as surrogate outcomes for overall survival in CML and 
how this evidence was used to inform National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence's recommendation on the public funding of these first-line treatments 
for CML.
METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the 
association between CCyR and MMR at 12 months and overall survival in patients 
with chronic phase CML. We estimated life expectancy by extrapolating long-term 
survival from the weighted overall survival stratified according to the 
achievement of CCyR and MMR.
RESULTS: Five studies provided data on the observational association between 
CCyR or MMR and overall survival. Based on the pooled association between CCyR 
and MMR and overall survival, our modeling showed comparable predicted mean 
duration of survival (21-23 years) following first-line treatment with imatinib, 
dasatinib, or nilotinib.
CONCLUSIONS: This case study illustrates the consideration of surrogate outcome 
evidence in health technology assessment. Although it is often recommended that 
the acceptance of surrogate outcomes be based on randomized controlled trial 
data demonstrating an association between the treatment effect on both the 
surrogate outcome and the final outcome, this case study shows that policymakers 
may be willing to accept a lower level of evidence (i.e., observational 
association).

Health state valuation in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review 
of the literature.

OBJECTIVE: Cost-utility analysis is widely used in high-income countries to 
inform decisions on efficient health care resource allocation. Cost-utility 
analysis uses the quality-adjusted life-year as the outcome measure of health. 
High-income countries have undertaken health state valuation (HSV) studies to 
determine country-specific utility weights to facilitate valuation of 
health-related quality of life. Despite an evident need, however, the extent of 
HSVs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is unclear.
METHODS: The literature was searched systematically by using four databases and 
additional Web searches to identify HSV studies carried out in LMICs. The 
Preferred Reporting System for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 
strategy was followed to ensure systematic selection of the articles.
RESULTS: The review identified 17 HSV studies from LMICs. Twelve studies were 
undertaken in upper middle-income countries, while lower middle- and low-income 
countries contributed three and two studies, respectively. There were 7 generic 
HSV and 10 disease-specific HSV studies. The seven generic HSVs included five 
EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, one six-dimensional health state short 
form (derived from short-form 36 health survey), and one Assessment of Quality 
of Life valuations. Time trade-off was the predominant valuation method used 
across all studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This review found that health state valuations from LMICs are 
uncommon and utility weights are generally unavailable for these countries to 
carry out health economic evaluation. More HSV studies need to be undertaken in 
LMICs to facilitate efficient resource allocation in their respective health 
systems.

Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Despite the use of identical clinical trial data (Anastrazole, Tamoxifen, Alone 
or in Combination for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with 
localised hormone receptor-positive breast cancer data), not dependent on 
differences between countries, the outcome of 11 published cost-effectiveness 
analyses varied more than 20-fold. The observed wide variation in predicted 
life-years gained (a parameter derived from clinical trial data) demonstrates 
that authors used substantially different methods for handling the same data. We 
therefore consider it to be of utmost importance to strive for standardization 
of and better guidance for disease-specific modeling in economic evaluations.

Estimating the proportion cured of cancer: some practical advice for users.

Health, Sydney, Australia. Electronic address: xueqiny@nswcc.org.au.

BACKGROUND: Cure models can provide improved possibilities for inference if used 
appropriately, but there is potential for misleading results if care is not 
taken. In this study, we compared five commonly used approaches for modelling 
cure in a relative survival framework and provide some practical advice on the 
use of these approaches.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for colon, female breast, and ovarian cancers were 
used to illustrate these approaches. The proportion cured was estimated for each 
of these three cancers within each of three age groups. We then graphically 
assessed the assumption of cure and the model fit, by comparing the predicted 
relative survival from the cure models to empirical life table estimates.
RESULTS: Where both cure and distributional assumptions are appropriate (e.g., 
for colon or ovarian cancer patients aged <75 years), all five approaches led to 
similar estimates of the proportion cured. The estimates varied slightly when 
cure was a reasonable assumption but the distributional assumption was not 
(e.g., for colon cancer patients ≥75 years). Greater variability in the 
estimates was observed when the cure assumption was not supported by the data 
(breast cancer).
CONCLUSIONS: If the data suggest cure is not a reasonable assumption then we 
advise against fitting cure models. In the scenarios where cure was reasonable, 
we found that flexible parametric cure models performed at least as well, or 
better, than the other modelling approaches. We recommend that, regardless of 
the model used, the underlying assumptions for cure and model fit should always 
be graphically assessed.

BACKGROUND: In the TEMPO (Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of 
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes) trial, tolvaptan 
significantly reduced expansion of kidney volume and loss of kidney function.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how the benefits of tolvaptan seen in TEMPO may relate 
to longer-term health outcomes, such as progression to end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) and death, and cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN: A decision-analytic model.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature from 1993 to 2012.
TARGET POPULATION: Persons with early autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
disease.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Patients received tolvaptan therapy until death, development of 
ESRD, or liver complications or no tolvaptan therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Median age at ESRD onset, life expectancy, discounted 
quality-adjusted life-years and lifetime costs (in 2010 U.S. dollars), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Tolvaptan prolonged the median age at ESRD onset 
by 6.5 years and increased life expectancy by 2.6 years. At $5760 per month, 
tolvaptan cost $744 100 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with 
standard care.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: For patients with autosomal dominant polycystic 
kidney disease that progressed more slowly, the cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained was even greater for tolvaptan.
LIMITATION: Although TEMPO followed patients for 3 years, the main analysis 
assumed that clinical benefits persisted over patients' lifetimes.
CONCLUSION: Assuming that the benefits of tolvaptan persist in the longer term, 
the drug may slow progression to ESRD and reduce mortality rates. However, 
barring an approximately 95% reduction in price, cost-effectiveness does not 
compare favorably with many other commonly accepted medical interventions.

Neurodegenerative disorders are an inhomogeneous group of neurological diseases 
that affect a large part of the population because of the rise in life 
expectancy. Although clinical manifestations are important to make the correct 
diagnosis, the new advanced imaging technique represent a very useful tool for 
the diagnostic work-up.

Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Current disease burden estimates do not provide evidence across 
different ethnic groups. This study aims to assess the disease burden as 
measured by the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for six ethnic groups in 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, for 2011 and 2030.
METHODS: The DALYs were calculated by combining three components: 
disease-/sex-/age-specific DALYs per person; disease-specific relative risks 
(RRs) by ethnicity; and sex-/age-specific population sizes by ethnicity in 
Amsterdam in 2011 and 2030. Disease-specific DALYs were derived from the 
National Institute of Public Health. The RRs were obtained through a systematic 
review of studies published in 1997-2008. The population figures were gathered 
from the Statistics Netherlands and municipality of Amsterdam.
RESULTS: The findings suggest that cardiovascular diseases and anxiety and 
depressive disorders dominate disease burden in all ethnic groups in 2011 and 
2030. In most of the non-Western ethnic minorities, diabetes mellitus is the 
strongest contributor to the disease burden. The total disease burden will 
increase more strongly in non-Western ethnic minorities than ethnic Dutch. The 
2030 disease burden is estimated to be highest among Surinamese and Antilleans.
CONCLUSIONS: In ethnic minorities, diabetes plays an important role in the 
disease burden, and the total disease burden will grow stronger than ethnic 
Dutch, resulting in a higher total disease burden for some ethnic groups in 
2030. We encourage researchers to estimate the disease burden by ethnicity so 
that health priorities can be set in the fields of policy, health care and 
research.

    Demography. 2018 Mar 22;:

A number of indices exist to calculate lifespan variation, each with different 
underlying properties. Here, we present new formulae for the response of seven 
of these indices to changes in the underlying mortality schedule (life 
disparity, Gini coefficient, standard deviation, variance, Theil's index, mean 
logarithmic deviation, and interquartile range). We derive each of these indices 
from an absorbing Markov chain formulation of the life table, and use matrix 
calculus to obtain the sensitivity and the elasticity (i.e., the proportional 
sensitivity) to changes in age-specific mortality. Using empirical French and 
Russian male data, we compare the underlying sensitivities to mortality change 
under different mortality regimes to determine the conditions under which the 
indices might differ in their conclusions about the magnitude of lifespan 
variation. Finally, we demonstrate how the sensitivities can be used to 
decompose temporal changes in the indices into contributions of age-specific 
mortality changes. The result is an easily computable method for calculating the 
properties of this important class of longevity indices.

Mastocytosis: update on pharmacotherapy and future directions.

INTRODUCTION: Mastocytosis is a disorder characterized by abnormal mast cell 
(MC) accumulation in skin and internal organs such as bone marrow. The disease 
follows a benign course in most patients with cutaneous and indolent systemic 
mastocytosis (SM); however, advanced variants associated with decreased life 
expectancy also exist. Pharmacotherapy of mastocytosis is aimed at the control 
of symptoms caused by MC mediator release, treatment of comorbidities and 
cytoreductive therapies in advanced variants.
AREAS COVERED: This article will cover the general treatment principles of 
anti-MC mediator and cytoreductive therapies of mastocytosis. The literature 
discussed was retrieved with PubMed using the search terms 'treatment of 
mastocytosis,' 'mastocytosis antimediator therapy' and looking for important 
cross-references.
EXPERT OPINION: Pharmacotherapy of mastocytosis should be individualized for 
each patient considering the category of disease, reduction of risk of 
anaphylaxis, constitutional symptoms and comorbidities including osteoporosis. 
Cytoreductive therapies are generally reserved for patients with aggressive 
mastocytosis (ASM), MC leukemia (MCL) and MC sarcoma (MCS); however, some 
patients with indolent disease and recurrent anaphylactic episodes not 
responsive to antimediator therapies may also be considered for cytoreduction on 
a case-by-case basis.

Quantifying the burden of disease due to premature mortality in Hong Kong using 
standard expected years of life lost.

BACKGROUND: To complement available information on mortality in a population 
Standard Expected Years of Life Lost (SEYLL), an indicator of premature 
mortality, is increasingly used to calculate the mortality-associated disease 
burden. SEYLL consider the age at death and therefore allow a more accurate view 
on mortality patterns as compared to routinely used measures (e.g. death 
counts). This study provides a comprehensive assessment of disease and injury 
SEYLL for Hong Kong in 2010.
METHODS: To estimate the SEYLL, life-expectancy at birth was set according to 
the 2004 Global Burden of Disease study at 82.5 and 80 years for females and 
males, respectively. Cause of death data for 2010 were corrected for 
misclassification of cardiovascular and cancer causes. In addition to the 
baseline estimates, scenario analyses were performed using alternative 
assumptions on life-expectancy (Hong Kong standard life-expectancy), 
time-discounting and age-weighting. To estimate a trend of premature mortality a 
time-series analysis from 2001 to 2010 was conducted.
RESULTS: In 2010 524,706.5 years were lost due to premature death in Hong Kong 
with 58.3% of the SEYLL attributable to male deaths. The three overall leading 
single causes of SEYLL were "trachea, bronchus and lung cancers", "ischaemic 
heart disease" and "lower respiratory infections" together accounting for about 
29% of the overall SEYLL. Further, self-inflicted injuries (5.6%; ranked 5) and 
liver cancer (4.9%; ranked 7) were identified as important causes not adequately 
captured by classical mortality measures. Scenario analyses highlighted that by 
using a 3% time-discount rate and non-uniform age-weights the SEYLL dropped by 
51.6%. Using Hong Kong's standard life-expectancy values resulted in an overall 
increase of SEYLL by 10.8% as compared to the baseline SEYLL. Time-series 
analysis indicates an overall increase of SEYLL by 6.4%. In particular, group I 
(communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional) conditions showed highest 
increases with SEYLL-rates per 100,000 in 2010 being 1.4 times higher than 2001.
CONCLUSIONS: The study stresses the mortality impact of diseases and injuries 
that occur in earlier stages of life and thus presents the SEYLL measure as a 
more sensitive indicator compared to classical mortality indicators. SEYLL 
provide useful additional information and supplement available death statistics.

In Denmark 2-3% of men aged 65 years or more die from abdominal aortic aneurysms 
(AAA). The lethality of ruptured AAA is 75%, while the risk of preventive 
surgery is 2-3%. Ultrasonographic screening for AAA is fast, safe and reliable. 
Randomized trials show that screening halves the mortality from AAA, and reduces 
total mortality by 2%. The latest health economic study concludes that it is 
highly cost-effective to screen 65-year-old Danish men, as a quality-adjusted 
life year can be gained for about 5,100 DKK (555 GBP). This is less than one 
tenth of the recently approved Danish colorectal cancer-screening programme.

Across many taxa, intriguing positive correlations exist between intelligence 
(measured by proxy as encephalization), behavioral repertoire size, and 
lifespan. Here we argue, through a simple theoretical model, that such 
correlations arise from selection pressures for efficient learning of behavior 
sequences. We define intelligence operationally as the ability to disregard 
unrewarding behavior sequences, without trying them out, in the search for 
rewarding sequences. We show that increasing a species' behavioral repertoire 
increases the number of rewarding behavior sequences that can be performed, but 
also the time required to learn such sequences. This trade-off results in an 
optimal repertoire size that decreases rapidly with increasing sequence length. 
Behavioral repertoire size can be increased by increasing intelligence or 
lengthening the lifespan, giving rise to the observed correlations between these 
traits.

Mucolipidosis (ML) II and ML IIIα/β are allelic autosomal recessive metabolic 
disorders due to mutations in GNPTAB. The gene encodes the enzyme 
UDP-GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (GNPT), which is critical to proper trafficking 
of lysosomal acid hydrolases. The ML phenotypic spectrum is dichotomous. 
Criteria set for defining ML II and ML IIIα/β are inclusive for all but the few 
patients with phenotypes that span the archetypes. Clinical and biochemical 
findings of the 'intermediate' ML in eight patients with the c.10A>C missense 
mutation in GNPTAB are presented to define this intermediate ML and provide a 
broader insight into ML pathogenesis. Extensive clinical information, including 
radiographic examinations at various ages, was obtained from a detailed study of 
all patients. GNPTAB was sequenced in probands and parents. GNPT activity was 
measured and cathepsin D sorting assays were performed in fibroblasts. 
Intermediate ML patients who share the c.10A>C/p.K4Q mutation in GNPTAB 
demonstrate a distinct, consistent phenotype similar to ML II in physical and 
radiographic features and to ML IIIα/β in psychomotor development and life 
expectancy. GNPT activity is reduced to 7-12% but the majority of newly 
synthesized cathepsin D remains intracellular. The GNPTAB c.10A>C/p.K4Q missense 
allele results in an intermediate ML II/III with distinct clinical and 
biochemical characteristics. This delineation strengthens the utility of the 
discontinuous genotype-phenotype correlation in ML II and ML IIIα/β and prompts 
additional studies on the tissue-specific pathogenesis in GNPT-deficient ML.

In the last years, the number of total hip arthroplasty is increased both in 
young patients and elderly with a poor bone quality due to extension of surgical 
indications. According to this trend, also revision surgery showed a growth of 
its number, especially in elderly patients, because of implant loosening, failed 
osseointegration of prosthetic components, errors in biomechanical restoration 
and infections. The aim of this study is to analyze life quality improvement 
through evaluation of articular functionality and postoperative pain, and to 
examine osseointegration of implant components with periprosthetic bone. During 
total hip arthroplasty revision, the orthopedic surgeon often has to face 
complex cases, especially in elderly patients with a preexisting status of poor 
bone quality and sarcopenia. In these cases, a correct planning and a surgical 
procedure well-executed are able to ensure a good outcome that led to pain 
relief and functional recovery. Furthermore anti-osteoporotic therapy surely 
represents a useful resource both in primary total hip arthroplasty and in 
revisions, mainly for elderly patients with a poor bone quality.

Ankle fractures in elderly patients.

The incidence of ankle fractures (AFs) in the elderly is rising due to the 
increase in life expectancy. Rather than directly related to osteoporosis, AFs 
are a predictor of osteoporotic fractures in other sites. In women AFs are 
associated with weight and BMI. AFs are difficult to categorize; therapeutic 
options are non-operative treatment with plaster casts or surgical treatment 
with Kirschner's wires, plates and screws. The choice of treatment should be 
based not only on the fracture type but also on the local and general 
comorbidity of the patient. Considering the new evidence that postmenopausal 
women with AFs have disrupted microarchitecture and decreased stiffness of the 
bone compared with women with no fracture history, in our opinion low-trauma AFs 
should be considered in a similar way to the other classical osteoporotic 
fractures.

Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.

BACKGROUND: Tinnitus affects approximately 30-50 million Americans. In 
approximately 0.5-1.0% of the population, tinnitus has a moderate to severe 
impact on their quality of life. Musculature and joint pathologies of the head 
and neck are frequently associated with tinnitus and have been hypothesized to 
play a contributing role in its etiology. However, specific physical therapy 
interventions to assist in improving tinnitus have not yet been reported.
PURPOSE: To describe the examination and treatment intervention of a patient 
with subjective tinnitus.
PATIENT DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 42-yr-old male experiencing intermittent 
bilateral tinnitus, headaches, blurred vision, and neck tightness. His 
occupation required long-term positioning into neck protraction. Examination 
found limitations in cervical extension, bilateral rotation, and side bending. 
Asymmetry was also noted with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) movements. Upon 
initial evaluation the patient demonstrated functional, physical, and emotional 
deficits per neck, headache, and dizziness self-report scales and a score on the 
Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) of 62. Resisted muscle contractions of the 
cervical spine in flexion, extension, and rotation increased his tinnitus.
INTERVENTION: Treatment focused on normalizing cervical spine mobility through 
repetitive movements, joint mobilization, and soft tissue massage.
RESULTS: At 2.5 mo, the patient demonstrated a complete reversal of his tinnitus 
after 10 physical therapy sessions as noted by his score of 0 on the THI upon 
discharge. He also demonstrated objective improvements in his cervical motion. 
This case reflected treatment targeted at cervical and TMJ impairments and 
notable improvements to tinnitus. Future studies should further explore the 
direct and indirect treatment of tinnitus by physical therapists through 
clinical trials.

Decision-analytic software commonly used to implement discrete Markov models 
requires transitions to occur between simulated health states either at the 
beginning or at the end of each cycle. The result is an over- or 
underestimation, respectively, of quality-adjusted life expectancy and cost, 
compared with the results that would be obtained if transitions were modeled to 
occur randomly throughout each cycle. The standard half-cycle correction (HCC) 
is used to remedy the bias. However, the standard approach to the HCC is 
problematic: It does not account for discounting or for the shape of 
intermediate state membership functions. Application of the standard approach to 
the HCC also has no numerical effect on the resulting incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio or change in net health benefit under certain 
circumstances. Alternatives to the standard HCC, in order of ease of use, 
include no correction, the life-table approach, the cycle-tree method, and a 
correction based on Simpson's rule. For less complex decision models in which 
the computational burden is not large, reducing the cycle length to a month or 
less and using no correction should result in small estimation biases. With more 
complex models, where cycle lengths larger than 1 month may be necessary to make 
computation feasible, we recommend the cycle tree approach. The latter is 
relatively easy to apply and has an intuitive appeal: Hypothetical subjects who 
transition from one state to another, on average halfway through a cycle, should 
receive half of the value associated with the state from which they come and 
half the value of the state to which they are going.

Cost-effectiveness of different strategies for stroke prevention in patients 
with atrial fibrillation in a health resource-limited setting.

Wu B(1), Kun L, Liu X, He B.

Author information:

Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

PURPOSE: To compare the lifetime cost and effectiveness of five alternative 
chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) management strategies: rivaroxaban, warfarin, 
aspirin plus clopidogrel, aspirin and no prevention.
METHODS: An individual-level state-transition model was developed to track the 
lifetime disease course associated with AF. The clinical and utility data were 
derived from published studies. The cost data were estimated based on local 
charges and current Chinese practices. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore 
the impact of uncertainty on the results.
RESULTS: For base-case patients with a CHADS2 score of 3, the cost per 
additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained for rivaroxaban compared 
with no prevention, aspirin, aspirin plus clopidogrel and warfarin was $116,884, 
$153,944, $155,979 and $216,273, respectively. CHADS2 score had a substantial 
impact on the model outcomes for different prevention strategies. The time 
distribution of warfarin international normalised ratio (INR), stroke and 
intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) risks, cost of rivaroxaban and utility of 
warfarin therapy had substantial impacts on the results. Based on a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $16,350/QALY, no prevention strategy was the 
preferred therapy for a patient with a low risk for stroke and a high risk for 
ICH; aspirin was preferred for patients with a moderate risk for stroke and ICH; 
and warfarin was preferred for patients with a high risk for stroke and a low 
risk of ICH.
CONCLUSION: In the context of limited health resources, rivaroxaban is unlikely 
to be cost-effective, although it provided more health benefits comparing with 
other strategies. Additionally, warfarin with good INR control might be more 
suitable for AF patients in developing regions.

India.

According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimation, 10% of the global 
population has some form of disability due to different causes; in India, it is 
3.8% of the population. Nearly 15-20% of the total physically handicapped 
children suffer from Cerebral Palsy (CP). For India, the estimated incidence is 
around 3/1000 live births; however, being a developing country, the expected 
actual figure may be much higher. Despite the advancement in modern technology 
and improved neonatal care, stagnant or increasing incidence of CP has been 
observed, which is of great concern. As far as management or preventive aspect 
is concerned, no satisfactory criteria have been developed to date. The present 
study is based on a positive hypothesis for the efficacy of Ayurvedic treatment. 
The study was carried out in 16 patients, 8 in each group, namely group A 
(Shashtika Shali Pinda Sweda externally and Samvardhana Ghrita internally) and 
group B (Samvardhana Ghrita internally) for 35 days duration. In group A, 
moderate improvement, mild improvement, and no improvement were observed in 50%, 
37.5% and 12.5% of patients respectively. In group B, moderate improvement and 
mild improvement were observed in 75% and 25% of the patients respectively. 
Statistical significance of results on selected criteria showed the efficacy of 
the selected Ayurvedic treatment modality in relieving the signs and symptoms of 
CP. Although it is incurable, Ayurvedic science can provide a better direction 
by improving the quality of life of children with CP with better life 
expectancy.

Physical function and exercise in older patients with cardiovascular and 
respiratory conditions.

The increase of life expectancy together with the decline of birth rates implies 
a global aging of populations living in industrialized countries. Since advanced 
age is associated with an exponential consumption of health care resources, this 
phenomenon is likely to pose a substantial threat to the stability of public 
health systems. Prevention of physical disability represents a major public 
health priority. Since disability is considered an irreversible condition, every 
effort should be made to prevent the onset of the disabling cascade and/or delay 
the physical function decline. The need for strategies against disability has 
led researchers to look for the most relevant risk factors potentially 
determining or accelerating the disabling cascade. In this context, 
cardiovascular and respiratory conditions have been indicated as playing 
prominent roles in the determination of frailty. Moreover, the high prevalence 
of these conditions among older persons makes them particularly amenable to 
targeting for preventive interventions. The aim of the present review is to show 
the impact of cardiovascular and respiratory conditions on physical function. 
Moreover, we will discuss the relationship of these conditions with the 
disabling process, and the importance of their assessment in the design of 
preventive interventions against disability in older persons.

Pituitary metastases have rarely been recorded in dogs, and to date, none of 
those reported have been of pancreatic origin. MRI findings are available for 
only one of those cases. Herein the authors present an 11 yr old English 
springer spaniel diagnosed with pituitary metastasis of pancreatic origin with a 
24 hr history of blindness and only a single lesion on MRI. Neurologic and 
ophthalmologic examinations localized the lesion to the optic nerves, optic 
tracts, or optic chiasm. MRI showed a single lesion characterized by a 
well-circumscribed pituitary mass with extrasellar extension, causing 
compression of the optic chiasm. Signal intensity was unusual as enhancement 
could not be appreciated after contrast administration. The dog was euthanized 
without further diagnostic tests. Histopathologic examination revealed a poorly 
differentiated exocrine pancreatic carcinoma with widespread metastasis 
involving the pituitary gland. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such 
case reported in a dog. Pituitary metastases should be included as a 
differential diagnosis for dogs presenting with acute-onset blindness and for 
single brain masses affecting the pituitary gland.

Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are now recognized to occur across all stages of 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and as a result there has been an increasing focus on 
their diagnosis, quantification and effective management. While in some 
subjects, NMS may be present before diagnosis, in advanced PD, NMS can 
contribute to hospitalization, severe disability and a shortened life 
expectancy. Strategies for continuous drug delivery have been reported to have a 
beneficial effect on NMS in PD and while the efficacy of apomorphine on motor
