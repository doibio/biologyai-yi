Obesity, defined as a body mass index of > or =30 kg/m(2), is a modern epidemic 
and is increasing worldwide. Depending on genetic make-up, lifestyle factors 
such as nutrition, physical activity, and psychosocial conditions are the main 
determinants of its manifestation and severity. Numerous epidemiological studies 
show consistently that obesity is associated with many comorbidities and, 
moreover, reduces life expectancy. For this reason, there is a need for 
evidence-based treatment considering the individual risk. For patients with 
extreme obesity exceeding a BMI of 40 kg/m(2), surgical intervention is the most 
effective treatment, not only to improve most somatic and psychological 
comorbidities significantly but also to prolong life.

Towards protein folding with evolutionary techniques.

Olshausenstrasse 40, 24098 Kiel, Germany.

We present design details and first tests of a new evolutionary algorithm 
approach to ab initio protein folding. It does not focus on dihedral angles 
exclusively, but mainly operates on introduction, extension, break-up, and 
destruction of secondary structure elements, given as correlated dihedral angle 
values. In first test applications to polyalanines (up to 60 residues) and 
random primary sequences (up to 40 residues), we demonstrate that this use of 
prior knowledge is well balanced: On the one hand, it ensures quick introduction 
of secondary structure elements if they are favorable for a given primary 
sequence, but still allows for efficient location of pure random coil solutions 
without enforcing any secondary structure elements, if folds of this type are 
preferred by the given primary sequence. Furthermore, the algorithm is clearly 
able to pack several secondary structure elements into favorable tertiary 
structure arrangements, although no part of the algorithm is explicitly designed 
to do this. In first test examples on real-life peptides between 21 and 44 
residues from the Protein Data Bank, the quality of the results depends on the 
force field used (as expected); nevertheless, we can show that the algorithm is 
able to find structures in good agreement with the targets easily and 
consistently, if the force field allows for that.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility and the related surgical techniques of 
laryngeal function preservation in surgical treatment of pyriform sinus cancer.
METHODS: Two hundred and thirty cases (stage I, 6; stage II, 10; stage III, 91; 
stage IV, 123) with pyriform sinus cancer were treated surgically from 1978 to 
1996 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Qilu Hospital of Shandong 
University. The methods of removing tumor and repairing surgical defects were 
depended on the extension of lesions. The laryngeal and pharyngeal functions 
were rebuilt by normal tissue preserved with lesions entirely removed. One 
hundred and fifty-eight cases were surgically treated with laryngeal functions 
preserved and 72 cases total laryngectomy. The most of the cases received 
postoperative radiotherapy.
RESULTS: The overall 3 and 5 year survival rates were 67.4% (155/230) and 48.3% 
(111/230) respectively. For stage I, the survival rate was 5/6; stage 11, 70.0% 
(7/10); stage III, 57.1% (52/91) and stage IV, 38.2% (47/123); the 3 and 5 year 
survival rates in functionally preserved group were 67.7% (107/158) and 50.0% 
(79/158), while in none functional group were 66.7% (48/72) and 43.1% (31/72), 
respectively. 75.3% (119/158) patients have laryngeal functions 
(voice,respiration and deglutition) completely restored and 24.7% (39/ 158) 
partially restored(voice and deglutition).
CONCLUSIONS: The preservative surgery is feasible for the selected pyriform 
sinus cancer cases. Choosing and following optimum surgical methods is a 
prerequisite for improving the quality of life of the cases.

10025, USA.

Immunodeficiencies frequently present in the skin antepartum and in the first 
year of life. Although genetic immunodeficiencies are uncommon, the worldwide 
incidence of the acquired immunodeficiency human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 
growing. Early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal immunodeficiencies and 
associated infections result in improved quality of life and longer life 
expectancy for these patients. In developed countries, improvements in therapy 
of HIV during pregnancy have resulted in reduced transmission to the neonate. 
This article reviews the common presentations and therapy of genetic and 
acquired neonatal immunodeficiencies.

of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. georg.enislidis@meduniwien.ac.at

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate complications 
before, during, and after vertical alveolar distraction osteogenesis and to 
assess the survival rate of dental implants placed in distracted bone.
STUDY DESIGN: In a consecutive series, 37 patients with 45 alveolar ridge 
deficiencies of the partially edentulous mandible were treated with 14 
intraosseous and 31 subperiosteal distraction devices. Seventy-two dental 
implants could be placed at the time of distractor removal and 21 implants at a 
second stage.
RESULTS: Complications associated with the distraction procedure affected 75.7% 
of patients. The majority of complications were of minor nature with the 
exception of fractures of basal bone (n = 3), fracture of transport segment (n = 
1), breakage of distractor (n = 1), and severe mechanical problems (n = 3). 
Eleven secondary grafting procedures were necessary to allow the placement of 
dental implants. Implant survival was 95.7% (mean postloading follow-up: 35.7 
months).
CONCLUSION: Vertical alveolar distraction osteogenesis is not an uncomplicated 
procedure; however, long-term survival of dental implants inserted into 
distracted areas is satisfactory.

Barcelona, Spain. tbrugal@aspb.es

AIMS: To assess the relationship between methadone treatment (MT) and overdose 
and HIV/AIDS mortality among heroin users resident in Barcelona city.
DESIGN: All patients who started treatment in any treatment centre between 1992 
and 1997 were included in a cohort the first time they were admitted for heroin 
addiction treatment. Follow-up controls were carried out every 9 months, on 
average, until 31 December 1999. Variables, both constant and varying over time, 
were fitted into Cox regression models.
FINDINGS: The study recruited 5049 patients, which provided 23,048.2 
person-years. Fifty per cent were in MT during the study period; of the total 
cohort 1005 patients died: 38.4% due to AIDS, 34.7% to overdose and 27% to other 
causes. Overall mortality decreased from 5.9 deaths per 100 person-years in 1992 
to 1.6 in 1999. Globally, life expectancy at birth was 39 years, 38 years lower 
than that of the general population. The main factor for overdose mortality was 
not being in MT at the time of death [relative ratio (RR) = 7.1]; other factors 
were being a current injector at baseline and being HIV positive. For AIDS 
mortality, the main factor was the calendar year (RR for 1996 versus 1999 = 
4.6), the next major factor was more than 10 years of heroin consumption, 
followed by not being in MT, being unemployed, then having a prison record.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed mortality decline could be linked to the effectiveness 
of low-threshold MT. The life expectancy of heroin users increased by 21 years 
during the study period.

School of Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Tokyo 113-8519,

BACKGROUND: Little is known about small-area variation in healthy longevity of 
older people and its socioeconomic correlates. This study aimed to estimate 
health expectancy at 65 years (HE65) at the municipal level in Japan, and to 
examine its relation to area socio-demographic conditions.
METHODS: HE65 of municipalities (N = 3361) across Japan was estimated by a 
linear regression formula with life expectancy at 65 years and the prevalence of 
those certificated as needing nursing care. The relation between HE65 and area 
socio-demographic indicators was examined using correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: The estimated HE65 (years) ranged from 13.13 to 17.39 for men and from 
14.84 to 20.53 for women. HE65 was significantly positively correlated with the 
proportion of elderly and per capita income, and negatively correlated with the 
percentage of households of a single elderly person, divorce rate, and 
unemployment rate. These relations were stronger in large municipalities (with a 
population of more than 100,000) than in small and medium-size municipalities.
CONCLUSION: A decrease in healthy longevity of older people was associated with 
a higher percentage of households of a single elderly person and divorce rate, 
and lower socioeconomic conditions. This study suggests that older people in 
urban areas are susceptible to socio-demographic factors, and a social support 
network for older people living in socioeconomically disadvantaged conditions 
should be encouraged.

Expectations regarding length and health related quality of life: some empirical 
findings.

Own expectations regarding length and future quality of life can differ from 
objective measures such as actuarial life expectancy. If so, this may have 
implications for health behaviour, seeking medical care and for methods used in 
health economic research. In this paper, we present evidence on own expectations 
regarding length and quality of life, using data obtained from a Dutch 
convenience sample (n=600). Data were obtained through a written questionnaire 
and a web-based survey. Own expectations regarding future quality of life were 
obtained by using the EQ-5D descriptive system on which respondents could 
indicate expected health profiles for the ages 60-90. We find that respondents 
significantly overestimate life expectancy (by 4.1 years, males 7.0 years and 
females 1.7 years), but appear to underestimate future quality of life from the 
age 70 onward. Regression analysis is used to explain individual expectations. 
Age, current health status and the perception of current lifestyle are 
especially important explanatory variables of people's own expectations 
regarding length and quality of life. Average age of death of relatives moreover 
explains self-estimated life expectancy, whereas self-estimated life expectancy 
explains expectations regarding quality of life. Given the influence inaccurate 
expectations may have on actual behaviour, more research on own expectations and 
their relation with actual behaviour is needed.

Modelling the effect of function and disease activity on costs and quality of 
life in rheumatoid arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: When treatments with the potential to change the natural history of a 
disease are introduced, their longer-term effect on costs and quality of life 
(utility) has to be estimated using economic models. However, to remain useful 
tools, models must be updated when new information becomes available. Our 
earlier models in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been based on functional 
status, but it has recently been shown that disease activity might have an 
independent effect on utility. The objective of this study was to improve the 
model by incorporating the effect of a subjective measure of disease severity 
and activity (global VAS).
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed with five states according to functional 
status (HAQ), and each state was subdivided according to the VAS (<40 and >40). 
Disease development (transition probabilities between the states) was taken from 
a longitudinal cohort study of patients with early RA in Sweden. A recent 
population-based survey of 616 patients with RA provided data on costs and 
utilities. The model incorporates the full distribution of costs and utilities 
from the survey, and long-term projections are made using Monte Carlo 
simulation.
RESULTS: The global VAS had a highly significant effect on utilities 
independently of HAQ. For resource consumption, only HAQ was a significant 
predictor, with the exception of sick leave, which was correlated with the VAS 
but not with HAQ. Using the cohort distribution from the longitudinal study, 
expected mean costs per patient over 10 yr were 106 034 euros (s.d. 5091 euros) 
(1 euro = SEK 9.20) and the expected number of quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) was 5.08 (s.d. 0.09). Patients starting at HAQ <0.6 but with 
consistently high VAS scores would have expected costs of 102 830 euros and 4.96 
QALYs, while patients with low VAS scores would have costs of 81 603 euros and 
6.01 QALYs.
CONCLUSION: Our new model incorporates for the first time the effect of a 
subjective measure of disease severity and activity on both costs and utility, 
making it a sensitive tool to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
disease-modifying treatments. New data on resource consumption indicate a shift 
to higher direct costs, particularly in early disease, and lower indirect costs 
in more advanced disease. The large size of the data sets used in this model 
reduces the uncertainty and makes estimates very stable.

Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus DNA testing in the United Kingdom, 
The Netherlands, France, and Italy.

Boston, MA, USA.

BACKGROUND: European countries with established cytology-based screening 
programs for cervical cancer will soon face decisions about whether to 
incorporate human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing and what strategies will be 
most cost-effective. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of incorporating HPV DNA 
testing into existing cervical cancer screening programs in the United Kingdom, 
The Netherlands, France, and Italy.
METHODS: We created a computer-based model of the natural history of cervical 
carcinogenesis for each using country-specific data on cervical cancer risk and 
compared each country's current screening policy with two new strategies: 1) 
cytology throughout a woman's lifetime, using HPV DNA testing as a triage 
strategy for equivocal cytology results ("HPV triage"), as well as 2) cytology 
until age 30 years and HPV DNA testing in combination with cytology in women 
more than 30 years of age ("combination testing"). Outcomes included reduction 
in lifetime cervical cancer risk, increase in life expectancy, lifetime costs, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, expressed as cost per year of life 
saved. We explored alternative protocols and conducted sensitivity analysis on 
key parameters of the model over a relevant range of values to identify the most 
cost-effective options for each country.
RESULTS: Both HPV DNA testing strategies, HPV triage and combination testing, 
were more effective than each country's status quo screening policy. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for HPV triage were less than $13,000 per year of life 
saved, whereas those for combination testing ranged from $9800 to $75,900 per 
year of life saved, depending on screening interval. We identified options that 
would be very cost-effective (i.e., cost-effectiveness ratio less than the gross 
domestic product per capita) in each of the four countries.
CONCLUSIONS: HPV DNA testing has the potential to improve health benefits at a 
reasonable cost compared with current screening policies in four European 
countries.

Outcomes after percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with CKD: 
improved outcome in the stenting era.

Stigant C(1), Izadnegahdar M, Levin A, Buller CE, Humphries KH.

Author information:
(1)Department of Health Care and Epidemiology, St Paul's Hospital, University of 
British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting reduces 
adverse events in the general population compared with balloon angioplasty. The 
benefit of stents in high-risk patients normally excluded from clinical trials 
has not been well studied. Outcomes after PCIs in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) before and after widespread use of stents were compared.
METHODS: All patients undergoing PCIs at our center within 2 periods selected 
for high and low stent use were included. Demographic, kidney and cardiac 
function, and PCI data were collected. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed, and 
Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the effect of high stent 
use on major adverse cardiac event, a composite of cardiac revascularization, 
myocardial infarction, or death 3 years after PCI.
RESULTS: A total of 1,879 patients (780 patients, low stent use; 1,099 patients, 
high stent use; 18% and 94.1% stent use, respectively) with a mean age of 63 
years, 73% men, and 26% of patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 
60 mL/min were included. At baseline, there was a greater prevalence of severe 
CKD, cardiac risk factors, and cardiovascular disease in the high-stent-use 
cohort. Major adverse cardiac events were reduced in the contemporary cohort 
(hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.72); this benefit 
extended across all stages of kidney function.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CKD undergoing PCI in the stenting era show improved 
outcomes. Additional studies are needed to determine optimal revascularization 
strategies in patients with CKD.

Quality of life in patients with spinal osteoporosis is impaired by the decline 
of spinal mobility. However, the factors related to the spinal mobility in these 
patients are still unclear. We evaluated the possible factors affecting spinal 
mobility in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. A total of 128 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis aged over 50 years (mean, 70 years) were 
included in this study. The thoracic and lumbar kyphosis angles and range of 
motion (ROM) of the total spine were measured in the upright position and at 
maximum flexion/extension with a computer-assisted device. The paravertebral 
muscle thicknesses (PVMT) of thoracic and lumbar spine in the upright position 
were measured using an ultrasound unit. The number of vertebral fractures was 
evaluated with radiographs of the spine. Isometric back extensor strength (BES) 
was evaluated with a strain-gauge dynamometer. Correlations between these 
variables were then analyzed. Age (r=-0.412), lumbar kyphosis angle (r=-0.284), 
BES (r=0.369), PVMT at the lumbar spine (r=0.227) and the number of vertebral 
fractures (r=-0.260) showed significant correlations with total spinal ROM 
(P<0.05). However, no significant correlations were observed between the total 
spinal ROM and PVMT at the thoracic spine (r=-0.069) or thoracic kyphosis angle 
(r=-0.138). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the BES was the most 
significant contributor to the total spinal ROM. The present study suggests a 
possible association between BES and spinal mobility in patients with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis.

The cost effectiveness of infliximab for severe treatment-resistant rheumatoid 
arthritis in the UK.

(1)Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness (from the UK NHS and personal 
social service perspectives) of infliximab plus methotrexate (MTX) compared with 
MTX alone, in the treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
who were not adequately controlled on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and 
who were resistant to MTX.
METHOD: Clinical data for the first year of therapy were taken from the ATTRACT 
(Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant 
Therapy) and a Markov model developed to assess costs and consequences in the 
longer term. Transition probabilities and health state valuations for the model 
were estimated based on the ARAMIS (Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical 
Information System) cohort, and resource use and costs ( 2,000 pounds values) 
obtained from various sources in the UK. Univariate sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The primary analysis suggested that infliximab plus MTX had an ICER of 
33,618 pounds per QALY gained. Alternative modelling assumptions and various 
other sensitivity analyses were applied, but the ICER always remained within the 
range for interventions typically funded by the NHS.
CONCLUSION: This model suggests, with its underlying assumptions and data, that 
the combination of infliximab and MTX may be a cost-effective treatment (from 
the UK NHS and personal social service perspectives) for patients experiencing 
RA that cannot be maintained on MTX alone.

Development of an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness of treatment 
interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Author information:

Middlesex, UK. michael.d.spencer@gsk.com

OBJECTIVE: To develop a Markov model that allows the cost effectiveness of 
interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to 
be estimated, and to apply the model to investigate the cost effectiveness of an 
inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist 
(beta(2)-agonist) combination (salmeterol/fluticasone propionate) versus usual 
care.
METHODS: A Markov model consisting of four mutually exclusive disease states was 
constructed (mild, moderate and severe disease, and death). The transition 
probabilities of disease progression (for smokers and ex-smokers) and death were 
derived from the published medical literature. The model outputs were costs, 
exacerbations, survival, QALYs and cost effectiveness. The model was made fully 
probabilistic to reflect the joint uncertainty in the model parameters. Efficacy 
data for the combination of inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 
50/500microg twice daily in poorly reversible COPD patients with a history of 
exacerbations were obtained from the 1-year TRISTAN (TRial of Inhaled STeroids 
ANd long-acting beta-agonists) study and applied to the model, based on patient 
profiles representative of COPD clinical trials.
RESULTS: According to the model, the mean life expectancy with usual care alone 
(placebo group) was 8.95 years, which decreased to 4.08 QALYs once adjusted for 
quality and discounted, at a lifetime discounted cost of Can 16,415 dollars per 
patient (year 2002 values). Assuming that salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 
reduced exacerbation frequency only (base case analysis), the estimated mean 
survival time remained unchanged but there was an increase in the number of 
QALYs (4.21) for an estimated lifetime cost of Can 25,780 dollars, resulting in 
a cost-effectiveness ratio of Can 74,887 dollars per QALY (95% CI 21,985, 
128,671) versus usual care. If a survival benefit was assumed for 
salmeterol/fluticasone propionate, the incremental cost per QALY was Can11,125 
dollars (95% CI 8710, dominated) versus usual care. If the combination achieved 
around a 10% improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, leading to 
delayed progression to more severe disease states, the benefits translated into 
an incremental cost per QALY of Can 49,928 dollars (95% CI 37 269, 66,006) 
versus usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: This Markov model allows, for the first time, a means of estimating 
the long-term cost effectiveness and cost utility of interventions for COPD. 
Initial evidence suggests that for patients with poorly reversible COPD and a 
documented history of frequent COPD exacerbations, the addition of salmeterol (a 
long-acting beta(2)-agonist) to fluticasone propionate (an inhaled 
corticosteroid) is potentially cost effective from the Canadian healthcare 
payer's perspective. However, the precision of this estimate will be improved 
when additional data are available from clinical trials such as the ongoing 
TORCH (TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health) study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The incidence and risk factors for the development of 
post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) are not well known, so the aim of our study is to 
evaluate the development of PTS after proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
its relationship with several clinical, laboratory and therapeutic factors.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective, observational study.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: consecutive patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT in 
the lower extremities diagnosed between February 2000 and July 2002.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: life expectancy < 12 months, impossibility for follow-up, 
renal or hepatic failure, previous PTS or varicosis and recurrent thrombosis 
during follow up. Endpoint: PTS at 12 months. Explicative variables: clinical 
risk factors for DVT, D-dimer value, hypercoaguable state, anticoagulant therapy 
and compression stockings compliance. Multivariable analysis (logistic 
regression) was performed.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy two patients with DVT were evaluated for 
inclusion. Sixty nine were excluded and 87 patients completed follow-up. PTS 
appeared in 47 patients (54%). Compliance of compression stockings was adequate 
in 57% of patients and decreased 45% the risk for PTS (p = 0.01). No significant 
associations were observed between PTS and others variables. Multivariable 
analysis confirmed the protective effect of compression stockings (RR = 0.3; p < 
0.01) and previous ipsilateral DVT appeared significatively associated with PTS 
development (RR = 8; p = 0.01) CONCLUSIONS: About 50% of patients with proximal 
DVT develop PTS within 1 year. Previous ipsilateral DVT is the strongest risk 
factor for PTS. Regular compression stocking use decreases the risk of PTS by 
50%.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between state size (measured in terms 
of public spending) and public health indicators in a sample of countries 
representing all regions of the world and from 1990-2000.
METHODS: An ecological study was performed using data on Central Government 
Spending (CGS) and per capita Gross National Product (GNP) obtained from the 
International Monetary Fund, and on life expectancy, maternal, and infant 
mortality, provided by the World Health Organization. A multiple linear 
regression model was fitted to estimate the effect of CGS on health, which also 
took into consideration per capita GNP and geographical region.
RESULTS: CGS varied little over the study period, with convergence around an 
average of 28%, but within a relatively wide range (7.80-53.0%); the countries 
with the strongest economies (according to per capita GNP) had the highest 
levels of CGS. The influence of this factor was particularly relevant for the 
infant mortality rate (r = 0.40; beta = -1.327; EE = 0.237; t = -5.590; p < 
0.001). Per capita GNP and geographic location were also associated with 
variations in health; health indicators tended to be worse for poorer countries 
in Africa and Asia. In the adjusted model, CGS was statistically significant 
with regard to infant and maternal mortality rates.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that state size (in terms of public spending) has 
an important influence upon health and particularly upon mortality. Although it 
is important to bear in mind the limitations of this study and the reduced time 
window used, these results should be taken into consideration in the current 
political and epidemiological debate.

We provide a description of health-related incentives faced by a rational smoker 
by considering the role of perception in both immediate quality-of-life effects 
of smoking and future risk of mortality. A person who adapts psychologically to 
a lowered health state, smokes more early in life and shifts demands for health 
investments and health-complementary activities later in life. He also smokes 
more in total. Someone aware of the full mortality consequences of smoking, 
smokes less and demands less medical care than someone who believes that these 
effects are highly reversible. The impacts of new information on mortality risk 
are most valuable early in life. Lastly, someone endowed with a longer life 
expectancy smokes more in the first part of life but conditional on access to 
medical care.

A nonparametric elicitation of the equity-efficiency trade-off in cost-utility

We performed an empirical elicitation of the equity-efficiency trade-off in 
cost-utility analysis using the rank-dependent quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
model, a model that includes as special cases many of the social welfare 
functions that have been proposed in the literature. Our elicitation method 
corrects for utility curvature and, therefore, our estimated equity weights are 
not affected by diminishing marginal utility. We observed a preference for 
equality in the allocation of health. The data suggest that the elicited equity 
weights were jointly determined by preferences for equality and by insensitivity 
to group size. A procedure is proposed to correct the equity weights for 
insensitivity to group size. Finally, we give an illustration how our method can 
be implemented in health policy.

Axioms for health care resource allocation.

Osterdal LP(1).

Author information:

This paper examines principles of health care resource allocation based on 
axioms for individual preferences and distributive justice. We establish axioms 
for representing individual preferences by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
as well as axioms for existence of a social welfare function depending only on 
QALYs. A symmetric Cobb-Douglas social welfare function is characterized by an 
axiom stating that social welfare is anonymous with respect to the distribution 
of individual life years. Replacing this axiom with an axiom of non-age 
dependence, we obtain a characterization of a utilitarian social welfare 
function with certain weights. Further, we give axioms for a social welfare 
function being a weighted sum of power transformations of individual QALYs.

We explore people's choices where the preference for those with worse future 
health prospects and the preference for the young over the old conflict. The 
empirical study used scenarios with four attributes: past years, past health, 
future years without treatment, and future health without treatment. One hundred 
respondents ranked various patient groups described in these terms. The results 
suggest a strong effect of past years: younger groups (40-year-olds) were always 
chosen over older ones (60-year-olds). Past health was significant in one 
question but not the other and future health and years without treatment were 
both non-significant.

Does prevention save costs? Considering deferral of the expensive last year of 
life.

Cologne, Cologne, Germany. afschin.gandjour@medizin.uni-koeln.de

Published cost-effectiveness analyses may overstate the cost-effectiveness ratio 
of preventive care if they do not explicitly model the costs of the last year of 
life, which is postponed by prevention. To determine the degree of 
overestimation, the authors built a statistical model using Medicare expenditure 
data on survivors and decedents. The model shows that the cost-effectiveness 
ratio of prevention may decrease by up to US$ 11,000 per quality-adjusted life 
year saved when expenditure data on the last year life are used. The model is 
able to explain more than half of the median cost increase of published 
cost-effectiveness analyses on clinical preventive services.

Medical cost-effectiveness analyses traditionally treat patients as isolated 
individuals and neglect the effects of improvement in patients' health on the 
welfare of their family members. We use a model based on a family utility 
function with altruistic linkages to show that there can be direct and indirect 
effects on the welfare of all family members. We focus specially on a model of 
how the spillover effects to the spouse in a two-person family might affect 
choice of treatments for prostate cancer. We then test the predictions of this 
model by analyzing treatment choices of prostate cancer patients using the 
linked SEER-Medicare database. We find that our results are consistent with the 
model's predictions. We conclude that cost-effectiveness analyses may better 
reflect the full costs and benefits of medical interventions if they incorporate 
these family effects. However, concerns about equity present a dilemma for the 
practice of CEA from the societal perspective.

Size and burden of mental disorders in Europe--a critical review and appraisal 
of 27 studies.

Epidemiological data on a wide range of mental disorders from community studies 
conducted in European countries are presented to determine the availability and 
consistency of prevalence, disability and treatment findings for the EU. Using a 
stepwise multimethod approach, 27 eligible studies with quite variable designs 
and methods including over 150,000 subjects from 16 European countries were 
identified. Prevalence: On the basis of meta-analytic techniques as well as on 
reanalyses of selected data sets, it is estimated that about 27% (equals 82.7 
million; 95% CI: 78.5-87.1) of the adult EU population, 18-65 of age, is or has 
been affected by at least one mental disorder in the past 12 months. Taking into 
account the considerable degree of comorbidity (about one third had more than 
one disorder), the most frequent disorders are anxiety disorders, depressive, 
somatoform and substance dependence disorders. When taking into account design, 
sampling and other methodological differences between studies, little evidence 
seems to exist for considerable cultural or country variation. Disability and 
treatment: despite very divergent and fairly crude assessment strategies, the 
available data consistently demonstrate (a) an association of all mental 
disorders with a considerable disability burden in terms of number of work days 
lost (WLD) and (b) generally low utilization and treatment rates. Only 26% of 
all cases had any consultation with professional health care services, a finding 
suggesting a considerable degree of unmet need. The paper highlights 
considerable future research needs for coordinated EU studies across all 
disorders and age groups. As prevalence estimates could not simply be equated 
with defined treatment needs, such studies should determine the degree of met 
and unmet needs for services by taking into account severity, disability and 
comorbidity. These needs are most pronounced for the new EU member states as 
well as more generally for adolescent and older populations.

Consequences of raising the height of a landfill in a water-deficient climate.

A large-scale field experiment has been carried out at the Coastal Park landfill 
which serves the City of Cape Town, South Africa. The landfill is unlined, and 
the City Council was under pressure from the central Government to cap and close 
the existing landfill and to establish an extension to the landfill with a 
lining to prevent the escape of leachate into the ground water. Measuring cells, 
installed to measure the rate of leachate flow from the landfill had shown that 
over a period of 9 years, from 1987 to 1995, leachate flow had averaged only 2% 
of rainfall. It therefore appeared possible, by increasing the moisture 
absorption capacity of the landfill, i.e., by increasing its height, to stop the 
leachate flow completely. If this could be achieved, there would be no need for 
a lining, and the raising would considerably extend the life of the landfill. 
The paper describes the experiment and its results, including the effects of the 
raising on leachate flow, settlement, leachate quality and the potential for 
polluting ground water, and the landfill's water balance.

The principal options for treatment of end-stage renal disease are hospital, 
out-center, self-or home hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory or automated 
peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were long considered 
competitive methods, but they have become complementary and the same patient can 
use them successively at different life stages. The choice of technique usually 
depends on family, personal, social and work factors, rather than the medical 
situation. The healthcare team provides guidance to the patient in making this 
choice. The choice of treatment is optimal when the referral is early.
