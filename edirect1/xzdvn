We aimed to investigate the status of falls and to identify important risk 
factors for falls in persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) including the 
non-elderly. Participants were 316 persons with T2D who were assessed for 
medical history, laboratory data and physical capabilities during 
hospitalization and given a questionnaire on falls one year after discharge. Two 
different statistical models, logistic regression and random forest classifier, 
were used to identify the important predictors of falls. The response rate to 
the survey was 72%; of the 226 respondents, there were 129 males and 97 females 
(median age 62 years). The fall rate during the first year after discharge was 
19%. Logistic regression revealed that knee extension strength, fasting 
C-peptide (F-CPR) level and dorsiflexion strength were independent predictors of 
falls. The random forest classifier placed grip strength, F-CPR, knee extension 
strength, dorsiflexion strength and proliferative diabetic retinopathy among the 
5 most important variables for falls. Lower extremity muscle weakness, elevated 
F-CPR levels and reduced grip strength were shown to be important risk factors 
for falls in T2D. Analysis by random forest can identify new risk factors for 
falls in addition to logistic regression.

BACKGROUND: Prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) remains the only means of 
preventing gastric cancer for people with genetic mutations predisposing to 
Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC), mainly in the CDH1 gene. The small but 
growing cohort of people undergoing PTG at a young age are expected to have a 
life-expectancy close to the general population, however, knowledge of the 
long-term effects of, and monitoring requirements after, PTG is limited. This 
study aims to define the standard of care for follow-up after PTG.
METHODS: Through a combination of literature review and two-round Delphi 
consensus of major HDGC/PTG units and physicians, and patient advocates, we 
produced a set of recommendations for follow-up after PTG.
RESULTS: There were 42 first round, and 62 second round, responses from 
clinicians, allied health professionals and patient advocates. The guidelines 
include recommendations for timing of assessments and specialties involved in 
providing follow-up, micronutrient supplementation and monitoring, bone health 
and the provision of written information.
CONCLUSION: While the evidence supporting the guidelines is limited, expert 
consensus provides a framework to best manage people following PTG, and could 
support the collection of information on the long-term effects of PTG.

Viperin is a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 
the antiviral ribonucleotide, 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydroCTP. The enzyme is 
conserved across all kingdoms of life, and in higher animals viperin is 
localized to the ER-membrane and lipid droplets through an N-terminal extension 
that forms an amphipathic helix. Evidence suggests that the N-terminal extension 
plays an important role in viperin's interactions with other membrane proteins. 
These interactions serve to modulate the activity of various other enzymes that 
are important for viral replication and constitute another facet of viperin's 
antiviral properties, distinct from its catalytic activity. However, the 
full-length form of the enzyme, which has proved refractory to expression in E. 
coli, has not been previously purified. Here we report the purification of the 
full-length form of viperin from HEK293T cells transfected with viperin. The 
purification method utilizes nanodiscs to maintain the protein in its 
membrane-bound state. Unexpectedly, the enzyme exhibits significantly lower 
catalytic activity once purified, suggesting that interactions with other 
ER-membrane components may be important to maintain viperin's activity.

Mental disorders account for a large and increasing health burden worldwide, as 
shown in the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study 2010. Unpacking how this 
burden in children and adolescents varies with sex, geographical regions, and 
ethnicities and how it has changed in the last 3 decades are important to 
improve the existing public health policies and prevention strategies. The study 
was conducted using GBD 2019 database. The burden of children and adolescents' 
(< 20 years old) mental disorders was displayed as prevalence, incidence, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost, and years lived with 
disability globally between 1990 and 2019. The number of DALYs in children and 
adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders was 21.5 million (95% CI: 15.2-29.6 
million) in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized rates of DALYs of 
mental disorders increased from 803.8 per 100,000 (95% CI: 567.7-1104.3 per 
100,000) to 833.2 per 100,000 (95% CI: 589.0-1146.1 per 100,000) population. 
Over the past 30 years, there had been a huge increase in the number of 
individuals suffering from anxiety disorders, major depressive disorders, and 
conduct disorders including an alarming increase in the rate of eating disorders 
such as 24.3% in bulimia nervosa and 17.0% in anorexia nervosa. Globally, 8.8% 
of children and adolescents have been diagnosed with varieties of mental 
illnesses, accounting for a heavy disease burden on public health. Besides, the 
worldwide increasing rates of anxiety disorders, major depressive disorders, and 
eating disorders have brought considerable challenges to public health 
undertakings, for which further prevention and treatment countermeasures are 
urgently needed.

The increasing production of nano-TiO2 has attracted extensive concerns about 
the ecological consequence and health risk of these compounds in natural 
ecosystem. However, little is known about its toxicity on zooplankton, 
especially its possibility to access to the food chain via dietary exposure. To 
address this concern, the toxic and cumulative effects of nano-TiO2 on an 
aquatic food chain were explored through two trophic levels independently or 
jointly including producer and consumer. The results revealed that exposure to 
suspensions of nanomaterials had negative effects on both producers and 
consumers. Specifically, nanoparticles reduced the density of algal cells in a 
concentration-dependent way, and hatching life expectancy, average lifespan, net 
reproductive rate, and population intrinsic growth rate of rotifers decreased 
significantly with the concentration of nanomaterials increased (P < 0.05). 
Notably, nanoparticles accumulated in algal cells and were transferred to 
consumers through dietary exposure. Biomagnification of nano-TiO2 was observed 
in this simplified food chain, as many of the biomagnification factor (BMF) 
values in this study were >1. Exposure concentration, exposure time and their 
interactions play a strong part in the accumulation of nanoparticles in algae 
and rotifers. Overall, the present findings confirmed that nano-TiO2 was 
deleterious to plankton, posing a significant environmental threat to aquatic 
ecosystems. Graphical abstract.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to identify and critically appraise the 
quality of model-based economic evaluation studies in mental health prevention.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, 
PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened for eligible 
records using predefined criteria and extracted data using a pre-piloted data 
extraction form. The 61-item Philips Checklist was used to critically appraise 
the studies. Systematic review registration number: CRD42020184519.
RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were eligible to be included. Thirty studies (61.2%) 
were published in 2015-2021. Forty-seven studies were conducted for 
higher-income countries. There were mainly cost-utility analyses (n = 31) with 
the dominant primary outcome of quality-adjusted life year. The most common 
model was Markov (n = 26). Most of the studies were conducted from a societal or 
health care perspective (n = 37). Only ten models used a 50-year time horizon 
(n = 2) or lifetime horizon (n = 8). A wide range of mental health prevention 
strategies was evaluated with the dominance of selective/indicate strategy and 
focusing on common mental health problems (e.g., depression, suicide). The 
percentage of the Philip checkilst's criteria fulfilled by included studies was 
69.3% on average and ranged from 43.3 to 90%. Among three domains of the Philip 
checklist, criteria on the model structure were fulfilled the most (72.1% on 
average, ranging from 50.0% to 91.7%), followed by the data domain (69.5% on 
average, ranging from 28.9% to 94.0%) and the consistency domain (54.6% on 
average, ranging from 20.0% to 100%). The practice of identification of 
'relevant' evidence to inform model structure and inputs was inadequately 
performed. The model validation practice was rarely reported.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an increasing number of model-based economic evaluations 
of mental health prevention available to decision-makers, but evidence has been 
limited to the higher-income countries and the short-term horizon. Despite a 
high level of heterogeneity in study scope and model structure among included 
studies, almost all mental health prevention interventions were either 
cost-saving or cost-effective. Future models should make efforts to conduct in 
the low-resource context setting, expand the time horizon, improve the evidence 
identification to inform model structure and inputs, and promote the practice of 
model validation.

College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610065, China.

Polar cell growth in plants requires a cell peripheral region that undergoes 
membrane extension and cell wall remodeling. Since the 1990s, RHO-RELATED 
GTPASES FROM PLANTS (ROPs) have been identified as master regulators that 
determine the site of cell growth. ROPs function to regulate actin and 
microtubule cytoskeletons, calcium gradients, and exocytosis, thus directing the 
delivery of materials for membrane and cell wall extension. In recent years, our 
understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying polar localization and the 
activation of ROPs has greatly advanced. Evidence points to the crucial roles of 
membrane lipids, receptor-like kinases, and cell wall components. In this 
review, we provide updates on the mechanisms underlying polarity control in 
tip-growing cells, with a focus on ROP effectors and membrane-associated 
signals. By integrating knowledge from pollen tubes, root hairs, and findings in 
bryophyte protonema cells and rhizoids, we hope to offer important insights into 
a common conceptual framework on polarity establishment governed by 
intercellular and extracellular signals.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance, 
that once conferred a life expectancy of only a few months. Over recent years, 
significant advances have been made to CF therapeutic approaches, changing the 
face of the disease, and facilitating the partial restoration of pancreatic 
function. This mini review summarizes the current landscape of exocrine 
pancreatic management in CF and explores areas for future direction and 
development.

Case Report: Challenging Treatment of an AorticParavalvular Leak: How We Avoided 
Interference With Mechanical Valve Function?

BACKGROUND: Aortic paravalvular leak (APVL) after surgical valve replacement 
(AVR) is an ominous complication with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Approximately 1-5% of PVLs can lead to serious clinical consequences, including 
congestive heart failure and/or hemolytic anemia.
CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old man with multiple comorbidities underwent surgical 
replacement of the aortic valve with a mechanical tilting disc prosthetic valve 
(Medtronic Starlight 27 mm). Several years later, recurrent episodes of 
congestive heart failure and hemolytic anemia developed due to a large 
crescent-shaped aortic PVL located at non coronary cusp (NCC) 9-12 o'clock, with 
moderate-to-severe regurgitation. The patient was deemed at prohibitive surgical 
risk due to significant multiple comorbidities and a transcatheter PVL closure 
(TPVLc) was planned. The huge PVL was partially closed by a first specifically 
designed paravalvular leak device (PLD). The procedure was complicated by 
transient interference of the second PLD with mechanical prosthetic valve 
function. This issue has however been solved with correct manipulation, 
orientation and downsizing of the second device implanted. At 3-month and 
13-month follow-up, the patient showed a relevant clinical improvement and good 
quality of life. 2D TTE color Doppler confirmed the stable position of the two 
PLDs with trace residual leak.
DISCUSSION: Surgical redo has been considered the treatment of choice for 
symptomatic patients with PVLs. Notwithstanding, TPVLc is a less invasive 
alternative, particularly in patients at high surgical risk in whom early 
diagnosis and prompt interventional treatment are crucial for improving 
expectancy and quality of life. Dedicated devices, appropriate procedural 
techniques, and the close interaction between imaging modalities, allowed to 
deal successfully with a challenging case of severe symptomatic aortic PVL.

BACKGROUND: The overall natural history, risk of death and surgical burden of 
patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is not well known.
METHODS: Patients with MEN1 from a nationwide cohort were included. The survival 
of patients with MEN1 was compared with that of the general population using 
simulated controls. The cumulative probabilities of MEN1-specific operations and 
postoperative mortality were assessed, and surgical sequences were analysed 
using sunburst charts and Venn diagrams.
RESULTS: A total of 1386 patients with MEN1 were included. Life expectancy was 
significantly reduced in patients with MEN1 compared with simulated controls 
from the general population, with a lifetime difference of 15 years. Mutations 
affecting the JunD interaction domain had a significant negative impact on 
survival. Survival for patients with MEN1 compared with the general population 
improved over time. The probability of experiencing at least one specific MEN1 
operation was above 95 per cent after 75 years, and most patients had surgery at 
least twice during their lifetime. Time to a 50 per cent risk of MEN1 surgery 
was 30.5 years for patients born after 1960, compared with 47.9 years for those 
born before 1960. Sex and mutations affecting the JunD interacting domain had no 
impact on time to first surgery. There was considerable heterogeneity in 
surgical sequences, with no specific clinical pathway.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy was significantly lower among patients with MEN1 
compared with the general population, and further decreased in patients with 
mutations affecting the JunD interacting domain. Almost all patients underwent 
at least one MEN1-specific operation during their lifetime, but there was no 
standardized sequence of surgery.

Presbyopia is the physiological, gradual, progressive loss of the ability to see 
clearly at near point which affects people as they age. It is primarily caused 
by the thickening and stiffening of the lens leading to an inability to adjust 
its shape to become convex enough to induce adequate plus power to see at short 
distances. Symptoms usually begin affecting individuals around 40 years of age, 
the most common being discomfort in or around the eyes after prolonged near 
work, blur at distance after near work, and eventually progressing to near blur, 
often with a natural tendency to distance the object by holding it farther away 
to try to see it better. At a certain point near tasks become impossible and the 
patient will seek an external solution. Various therapies are available and 
being developed to treat presbyopia, which include glasses, contact lenses, 
intraocular lens implants, corneal laser procedures, intracorneal implants, 
scleral alterations and pharmacological ocular drops. Untreated presbyopia 
negatively affects quality of life as well as the world productivity since 
presbyopia progresses from approximately an age when people are still an active 
part of the workforce. As the population and life expectancy grow, so will the 
number of presbyopes. This article will discuss the various options available to 
treat presbyopia.

Aim: To evaluate the economic burden of age- and race/ethnicity-based US 
maternal mortality disparities. Economic burden is estimated by years of 
potential life lost (YPLL) and value of statistical life (VSL). Methods: 
Maternal mortality counts (2018-2020) were obtained from the CDC Wide-ranging 
Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database. Life-expectancy data were 
obtained from the Social Security actuarial tables. YPLL and VSL were calculated 
and stratified by age (classified as under 25, 25-39, and 40 and over) and 
race/ethnicity (classified as Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black). 
Results: Economic measures associated with maternal mortality increased by an 
estimated 30%, from a YPLL of 32,824 and VSL of US$7.9 billion in 2018 to a YPLL 
of 43,131 and VSL of US$10.4 billion in 2020. Conclusion: Our findings suggest 
that age, race and ethnicity are major drivers of the US maternal mortality 
economic burden.

OBJECTIVE: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with inflammatory 
rheumatic diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), has been variable. 
Here, we assess disease activity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
through the pandemic in patients with AS.
METHODS: In the open-label extension (OLE) of the phase 2b BE AGILE study, 
patients with AS received 160 mg of subcutaneous bimekizumab every 4 weeks. We 
assessed Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score with C-reactive protein 
(ASDAS-CRP), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) scores in the OLE immediately 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (September 2019 to April 2021).
RESULTS: A total of 232 patients remained in the BE AGILE OLE and were included 
in this post hoc study at the start of the analysis period (September 1, 2019); 
12 patients had a COVID-19 treatment-emergent adverse event, and no cases 
resulted in death. The number of missed bimekizumab doses due to COVID-19 (11 
doses) was minimal, and missed assessments remained low (≤5%) compared with the 
prepandemic period. Mean ASDAS-CRP (1.8), BASDAI (2.4), and ASQoL scores (2.8) 
in the OLE were low at pre-pandemic baseline and remained stable at 1.7 to 1.8, 
2.2 to 2.4, and 2.0 to 2.8, respectively, across successive 3-month periods 
immediately before and during the pandemic. ASDAS-CRP, BASDAI, and ASQoL 
stability was consistent across major study countries.
CONCLUSION: Disease activity and HRQoL remained stable during the COVID-19 
pandemic in patients with AS receiving bimekizumab in the BE AGILE OLE, with no 
indication of negative effects on these outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Palpitations during peri- and post-menopause are common. It is 
unclear what variables are related to palpitations in peri- and post-menopausal 
women. The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize potential correlates 
of palpitations in women transitioning through menopause.
METHODS: The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Authors 
included English-language, full-length, peer-reviewed, cross-sectional research 
articles on palpitations in menopausal women published through December 18, 
2021, from PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature 
(CINAHL), and PsycINFO searches. Following de-duplication, screening of titles 
and abstracts, and review of full-texts, independent reviewers extracted data on 
variables studied in relationship to palpitations from 84 articles and resolved 
discrepancies. Authors extracted data on (1) demographic, clinical, biomarker, 
and symptom/quality of life variables and (2) data analysis method (bivariate, 
multivariate). Authors classified each variable as a likely, unlikely, or 
unclear correlate of palpitations.
RESULTS: Articles were diverse in region of origin, sample sizes, and variables 
assessed in relationship to palpitations. Evidence for any one variable was 
sparse. Likely correlates of palpitations included race/ethnicity, lower 
physical activity, worse vasomotor symptoms (VMSs), worse sleep, and worse 
quality of life. Unlikely correlates included age, employment, education, 
marital status, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, body mass index, and sexual 
difficulties. Unclear correlates due to equivocal evidence were menopausal 
status, smoking, and depression. Unclear correlates due to insufficient evidence 
(less than three articles) included all of the assessed biomarkers, anxiety, and 
stress.
CONCLUSION: Likely correlates were identified including race/ethnicity, physical 
activity, VMS, sleep, and quality of life. However, additional research is 
needed to better understand potential correlates of palpitations.

PURPOSE: Methodological challenges have limited economic evaluations of genome 
sequencing (GS) and exome sequencing (ES). Our objective was to develop 
conceptual frameworks for model-based cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of 
diagnostic GS/ES.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of economic analyses to develop and 
iterate with experts a set of conceptual CEA frameworks for GS/ES for prenatal 
testing, early diagnosis in pediatrics, diagnosis of delayed-onset disorders in 
pediatrics, genetic testing in cancer, screening of newborns, and general 
population screening.
RESULTS: Reflecting on 57 studies meeting inclusion criteria, we recommend the 
following considerations for each clinical scenario. For prenatal testing, 
performing comparative analyses of costs of ES strategies and postpartum care, 
as well as genetic diagnoses and pregnancy outcomes. For early diagnosis in 
pediatrics, modeling quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs over ≥20 
years for rapid turnaround GS/ES. For hereditary cancer syndrome testing, 
modeling cumulative costs and QALYs for the individual tested and 
first/second/third-degree relatives. For tumor profiling, not restricting to 
treatment uptake or response and including QALYs and costs of downstream 
outcomes. For screening, modeling lifetime costs and QALYs and considering 
consequences of low penetrance and GS/ES reanalysis.
CONCLUSION: Our frameworks can guide the design of model-based CEAs and 
ultimately foster robust evidence for the economic value of GS/ES.

PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT) constitutes a mainstay in the treatment of elderly 
patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), but use of simultaneous 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) remains controversial. We have conducted a prospective 
analysis based on real-world patient data to examine the health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) and cost effectiveness (CE) of CRT vs. RT in elderly HNC 
patients.
METHODS: Eligible participants ≥ 65 years treated in a large tertiary cancer 
center between July 2019 and February 2020 who completed the validated EQ-5D-5L 
questionnaire (health state index [HI] and visual analog scale [VAS]) before and 
after RT were included. CE referred to direct medical costs, including 
diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based billings for inpatients and uniform 
assessment standard (EBM)-based costs for outpatients. The primary endpoint was 
cost (euros [€]) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Costs and QALYs were not 
discounted for short overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Baseline HRQoL was 0.878 (±0.11) in the CRT group and 0.857 (±0.17) in 
the RT group. Upon completion of therapy, HRQoL amounted to 0.849 (±0.14) in the 
CRT and 0.850 (±0.13) in the RT group. The mean treatment-related cost in the 
CRT cohort was €22,180.17 (±8325.26) vs. €18,027.87 (±26,022.48) in the RT 
group. The corresponding QALYs amounted to 2.62 in the CRT and 1.91 in the RT 
groups. The ICER was €5848.31.
CONCLUSION: This is the first analysis from the German health care system 
demonstrating that the addition of chemotherapy to RT for selected elderly HNC 
patients is cost effective and not associated with a significant HRQoL decline.

The western flower thrip (WFT) Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) is a 
serious agricultural pest with a wide host range which has developed resistance 
to several groups of insecticides. In this study, the effect of insecticide 
resistance on WFT host adaptability was explored by examining changes in 
detoxification enzyme activities and thrip development, and reproduction on 
preferred and less preferred host plants, eggplant Solanum melongena L. and 
broad bean Vicia faba L., respectively. Thrips were screened with spinetoram on 
kidney bean for six generations. Activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), 
mixed function oxidases (MFOs), and cytochrome P450 enzyme (P450) in a resistant 
strain (RS) reared on broad bean were significantly higher than those in a 
sensitive strain (SS), and only carboxylesterase (CarE) increased in the RS when 
reared on eggplant, compared with the SS. Activities of the four detoxification 
enzymes in the RS reared on broad bean were significantly higher than in those 
reared-on eggplant. On broad bean, RS adult longevity was lower and 
developmental duration of offspring was shorter than those of the SS, but 
fecundity increased. On eggplant, RS fecundity was lower and developmental 
duration of offspring was shorter than those of the SS. In addition, fecundity 
was higher and developmental duration was longer in the RS reared on broad bean 
than in those reared-on eggplant. The results indicated that spinetoram 
resistance could change WFT host preference and that those changes might be 
associated with detoxification enzyme activities. Thus, it was hypothesized that 
adaptability of the RS to the less preferred host broad bean increased, whereas 
adaptability to the preferred host eggplant decreased.

OBJECTIVE: The PULsE-AI trial sought to determine the effectiveness of a 
screening strategy that included a machine learning risk prediction algorithm in 
conjunction with diagnostic testing for identification of undiagnosed atrial 
fibrillation (AF) in primary care. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of implementing the screening strategy in a real-world 
setting.
METHODS: Data from the PULsE-AI trial - a prospective, randomized, controlled 
trial conducted across six general practices in England from June 2019 to 
February 2021 - were used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis that included 
a hybrid screening decision tree and Markov AF disease progression model. Model 
outcomes were reported at both individual- and population-level (estimated UK 
population ≥30 years of age at high-risk of undiagnosed AF) and included number 
of patients screened, number of AF cases identified, mean total and incremental 
costs (screening, events, treatment), quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The screening strategy was estimated to result in 45,493 new diagnoses 
of AF across the high-risk population in the UK (3.3 million), and an estimated 
additional 14,004 lifetime diagnoses compared with routine care only. 
Per-patient costs for high-risk individuals who underwent the screening strategy 
were estimated at £1,985 (vs £1,888 for individuals receiving routine care 
only). At a population-level, the screening strategy was associated with a cost 
increase of approximately £322 million and an increase of 81,000 QALYs. The 
screening strategy demonstrated cost-effectiveness versus routine care only at 
an accepted ICER threshold of £20,000 per QALY-gained, with an ICER of 
£3,994/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with routine care only, it is cost-effective to target 
individuals at high risk of undiagnosed AF, through an AF risk prediction 
algorithm, who should then undergo diagnostic testing. This AF risk prediction 
algorithm can reduce the number of patients needed to be screened to identify 
undiagnosed AF, thus alleviating primary care burden.

PURPOSE: Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA (MPS IIIA) is an inherited lysosomal storage 
disorder caused by mutations in the N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase gene that 
result in deficient enzymatic degradation of heparan sulfate (HS), resulting in 
progressive neurodegeneration in early childhood and premature death. A 
chemically modified variant of recombinant human sulfamidase, SOBI003, has shown 
to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice and achieve pharmacologically 
relevant levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We report on a phase 1/2, 
open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study (NCT03423186) and its extension study 
(NCT03811028) to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and clinical efficacy of SOBI003 in 
patients with MPS IIIA for up to 104 weeks.
METHODS: Six patients aged 1-6 years with confirmed MPS IIIA with developmental 
age ≥ 12 months received weekly intravenous injections of SOBI003 at 3 mg/kg 
(Cohort 1, n = 3) or 10 mg/kg (Cohort 2, n = 3). During the extension study, the 
individual dose of SOBI003 could be adjusted up to 20 mg/kg at the discretion of 
the investigator.
