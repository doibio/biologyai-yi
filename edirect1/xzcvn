but substantial differences between countries remain. Cardiovascular diseases 
still represent the major burden, although there have been substantial 
improvements. There are many opportunities for mutual learning among otherwise 
similar countries with different patterns of disease.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluated outcomes of mitral valve surgery for severe 
ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR).
METHODS: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with 
concomitant mitral valve repair (MVr) or replacement (MVR) for severe IMR at a 
single center between 2010 and 2017 were included. The primary outcome was 
5-year survival. Secondary outcomes included operative mortality and morbidity, 
hospital readmission, recurrence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), 
and mitral valve reoperation.
RESULTS: A total of 358 patients underwent concomitant mitral valve surgery with 
CABG for severe IMR (275 MVr and 83 MVR). Unadjusted and risk-adjusted operative 
mortality was higher in MVR (16% vs 8%; P = .04). MVR patients had higher rates 
of postoperative renal failure, prolonged ventilation, and deep sternal wound 
infection. The unadjusted 5-year survival was similar (MVR 64% vs MVr 64%; 
P = .41), a finding that persisted after risk-adjustment. The 5-year freedom 
from mitral valve reoperation was 96% and 97% (P = .47). Freedom from at least 
moderate MR at 1-year and 3-years was 100% vs 86% (P = .09) and 100% vs 68% 
(P = .06) for MVR and MVr, respectively. However, only three MVr patients 
developed severe MR by 3 years. Cumulative hazards for all-cause readmission and 
heart failure-specific readmission were higher with MVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a trend towards higher risk of MR recurrence, patients 
undergoing MVr have similar rates of survival and mitral valve reoperation, with 
lower rates of readmission at 5-years. This, combined with lower operative 
mortality rates, makes MVr a reasonable choice particularly in sicker patients 
with higher operative risk and more limited life expectancy.

Promotion of physical activity among older adults is considered to be one of the 
main actions that can result in more successful aging. Currently, there are few 
studies focusing on the effects of long-duration physical activity interventions 
in older adults. This study examined the effects of an 8-month multicomponent 
intervention on cardiorespiratory capacity (6-minute walking test), body 
composition (body-mass index), muscle strength (handgrip and knee extension), 
and bone mineral density (femoral neck) in a group of nonagenarians. A secondary 
aim was to determine the impact of the program according to the participant's 
way of life (institutionalized vs. community dwelling). A total of 14 
institutionalized nonagenarians (years: 93.1 ± 1.6; female: 100%) and 16 
community-dwelling nonagenarians (years: 93.1 ± 1.6; female: 75%) participated 
in this study. Our analysis suggested that the multicomponent program 
significantly improved the levels of strength in handgrip and leg extension in 
all participants. Intergroup analysis showed that the changes experienced were 
greater in community-dwelling people. Improvements in the cardiorespiratory 
capacity of older adults-more distance walked in 6 minutes-who were living in 
the nursing home (mean distance traveled: 238.5 ± 96.0 vs. 250.7 ± 99.0 m) were 
observed. Our findings found that an 8-month, multicomponent intervention 
program results in significant improvements in the levels of strength (handgrip 
and knee extension) in nonagenarians. This effect is greater in 
community-dwelling people.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly lethal cancer. 
Clinicians commonly refer to surgical therapy as resection with curative intent. 
However, PDA cure rates after resection remain unknown and the definition of 
cure remains vague. We investigated how patients (the majority undergoing 
resection), family members, and clinicians understand the concept of cure, to 
better inform discussions with patients regarding PDA prognosis.
METHODS: In a prospective survey, cohorts were asked to indicate the best 
definition of cure from three choices: 5-year survival endpoint (typically used 
in the literature), a biological endpoint without biochemical or radiographic 
signs of disease (similar to the NCI definition), or a practical endpoint where 
life span approximates similarly aged patients without PDA. Fleiss' kappa 
statistic was calculated to measure inter-rater agreement.
RESULTS: Patients, family members, and health care professionals (N = 200) 
agreed that renormalization of life expectancy was the preferred definition of 
cure in the context of pancreatic cancer. Inter-rater agreement was highest for 
the patient and family member groups (Fleiss' kappa 0.27 and 0.40, respectively, 
P < 0.001), while variability was observed between health care professionals 
(Fleiss' kappa 0.11, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In all groups surveyed, the probability for a normal life 
expectancy is the preferred long-term metric in patients with early-staged 
pancreatic cancer. Renormalization of life expectancy appears to be an important 
therapy goal for PDA patients and it is advisable to address this topic during 
clinical discussions.

Heart valve disease (HVD) affects 2.5% of the US population and one million 
individuals aged 65 years and older in the UK. Given its burden, the aim of the 
present review was to assess the cost-effectiveness of heart valve replacement 
with mechanical versus biological prosthesis in HVD patients. We performed a 
systematic search in various electronic databases from January 1990 to June 
2019. Five out of 542 articles were entered into the study, from which 2 papers 
were subsequently excluded not meeting the minimum number of items of the CHEERS 
checklist. Quality-Adjusted Life Year, Life Years Gained, and the Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) regarding the type of replaced heart valve were 
extracted and reported. Studies were conducted in three different countries 
(Iran, France, and USA). ICER ranged from $1253 in Iran to €54,634 in France. 
Survival rate of mitral mechanical versus biological valves at 10 and 20 years 
was 72.9% versus 76.0% and 51% versus 30%, respectively. Survival rate at 
20 years in patients undergoing atrial valve replacement was 20%. Ten- and 
20-year death rates for biological valves were higher with respect to mechanical 
prosthesis (15.5% versus 8.4% at 10 years), with this difference becoming more 
relevant at 20 years (36.9% versus 13.9%). Due to higher ICER, mortality rate, 
and lower success rates in the long term for biological prostheses compared to 
mechanical ones, these appear to be more suitable for older patients (aged 
≥ 70 years).

Frailty indicators in older cancer patients.

[Article in English, Norwegian]

Berg AS, Rostoft S.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients over 70 years old with cancer is growing. 
Chronological age provides limited information about tolerance for cancer 
treatment and life expectancy. We wanted to study frailty indicators of 
potential importance for making choices about therapy and the need for 
cross-disciplinary assessment for cancer patients aged ≥ 70 at an oncology 
outpatients clinic.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study is a retrospective survey based on medical 
records of initial consultations for patients aged ≥ 70 at the Department of 
Oncology, Drammen Hospital, in 2017. Medication use, comorbidity and the results 
of the Geriatric 8 (G-8) screening tool were recorded.
RESULTS: The median number of drugs taken regularly was four for the 
235 patients aged ≥ 70 who were initially assessed in 2017. Cardiovascular 
disease was recorded in 101 patients (43 %), impaired renal function in 47 
(20 %), pulmonary disease in 37 (16 %) and diabetes in 25 (11 %). A total score 
of < 15 was obtained for 100 (69 %) of the 144 patients scored by means of 
Geriatric 8, which indicates potential frailty.
INTERPRETATION: Frailty indicators of potential importance for the choice of 
treatment and follow-up are frequently seen in older cancer patients.

Treatment guidelines for patients with schizophrenia recommend evaluating their 
risk of physical comorbidities, especially since these patients are known to 
have decreased life expectancy due to comorbidities. Therefore, to the authors' 
knowledge, this is the first national survey conducted to investigate how 
Italian psychiatrists deal with the risk of physical comorbidities and sexual 
dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia. A sample of 750 psychiatrists 
completed an ad hoc online survey investigating their decision making about 
performing blood tests, clinical and instrumental examinations, and scheduling 
follow-up appointments in relation to the different phases of the illness and 
possible pharmacological side effects. Compared to patients in therapeutic 
continuation, those diagnosed for the first time and those who received a 
therapeutic change were visited more frequently (every 15 to 17 days vs. every 
40 days, respectively), and were more regularly prescribed blood tests and 
instrumental examinations (every 4.2 to 4.4 months vs. every 9 months, 
respectively). There was a high interest in the surveillance of cardiometabolic 
risk. In 54% of patients, prolactin testing was not requested before starting an 
antipsychotic. In terms of specialist referrals, only 5% of surveyed 
psychiatrists "never" sought for additional counseling. There was little 
attention given to sexual functioning assessment based on the survey results 
about patients' daily life and with regard to deciding to prescribe additional 
examinations. In fact, only up to 3% of psychiatrists reported assessing sexual 
functioning using specific psychometric tests. In summary, Italian psychiatrists 
describes themselves as careful healthcare providers for the physical illnesses 
of patients with schizophrenia but with several shortcomings. For instance, 
clinical attention toward patients' sexual and reproductive healthcare needs 
remains a challenge. Psychiatrists should take the lead for the integrated 
education, assessment, and care of medical needs of their patients with mental 
illness. Based on the results of this survey, the authors also believe that a 
future challenge for the management of patients with mental illness will be the 
classification of patients based on their risk of comorbidities, to help ensure 
optimal healthcare provision for those at greater risk of other illnesses.

Mastocytosis is a rare disease due to the abnormal accumulation of mast cells in 
various tissues. Its clinical presentation is heterogeneous depending on mast 
cell infiltration and mediators release. In some cases, it is associated with 
hematological malignancies. Prognosis varies from very good with a life 
expectancy similar to the general population in indolent forms of the disease to 
a survival time of just a few months in mast cell leukemia. Although in most 
cases a somatic KIT D816V mutation is found in tumor mast cells, the 
physiopathology of the disease is not yet fully understood. Additional germline 
and somatic mutations may explain this heterogeneity. Treatments aim at blocking 
effect of mast cell mediators, reducing mast cell activation and tumor burden. 
New drugs mainly directed against the tyrosine kinase activity of KIT have 
dramatically changed the quality of life and prognosis of mast cell diseases. 
Present and future therapeutic strategies are discussed in this review.

Surgery is the only treatment for biliary tract cancer with long term survival. 
Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed at stage IV with distant metastases. 
In these circumstances, life expectancy is less than one year due to aggressive 
tumour biology and a lack of effective systemic therapies. HER2 overexpression 
or amplification is predominantly seen in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 
gallbladder cancer (10-18%) and rarely in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (1%). 
Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets HER-2. We present a clinical 
case with a stage IV gallbladder cancer (liver and interaortocaval lymph node 
metastases), which presented progression during first-line chemotherapy 
treatment, which prompted a change in therapy to study the Her 2/Neu mutation 
which showed an intense positive overexpression. A combination of 
HER2/Neu-directed therapy (Trastuzumab) with second-line chemotherapy, was able 
to achieve a long term complete radiological, metabolic, and biochemical 
response. A curative intention surgery was performed and the patient is alive 
and recurrence-free at five years. To the best of our knowledge, we present a 
case which is the first report of a patient with a Stage IV gallbladder cancer 
who achieved a five-year survival without recurrence after a conversion therapy 
combining chemotherapy plus Trastuzumab and radical salvage surgery.

BACKGROUND: Using data from the 4-year follow-up results of an open, randomised, 
phase II study, this patient-based cost-effectiveness analysis compares mFOLFIRI 
(irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, the IRI arm) with mFOLFOX7 
(oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, the OXA arm) as first-line 
treatments in patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (GC).
METHODS: A Markov model was created based on previous results reported at the 
2016 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium to evaluate mFOLFIRI and mFOLFOX7 for 
advanced GC quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were examined as the primary outcomes.
RESULTS: For the evaluable 128 patients, treatment efficacy was 0.59 QALYs for 
the IRI arm and 0.70 QALYs for the OXA arm, with a total cost of $13,861.34 for 
the IRI arm and $14,127.30 for the OXA arm. Hence, the ICER was $2,417.82 per 
QALY the OXA arm, which was below the threshold of 3 × per capita GDP of China. 
For subgroup analysis of those receiving mFOLFIRI followed by mFOLFOX7 (the IRI 
arm) and the reverse (the OXA arm), the OXA arm gained 0.44 more QALYs than the 
IRI arm with a total cost of $28,890.09 for the IRI arm and $31,147.30 for the 
OXA arm. However, the cost per QALY was also lower for the OXA arm than for the 
IRI arm, and the cost per QALY gained was $5,129.55 (below the Chinese WTP).
CONCLUSION: mFOLFOX7 is a very high cost-effective alternative as the first-line 
treatment for those patients with advanced GC compared with mFOLFIRI.

BACKGROUND: Early palliative care team consultation has been shown to reduce 
costs of hospital care. The objective of this study was to investigate the 
association between palliative care team (PCT) consultation and the content and 
costs of hospital care in patients with advanced cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted in 12 
Dutch hospitals. Patients with advanced cancer and an estimated life expectancy 
of less than 1 year were included. We compared hospital care during 3 months of 
follow-up for patients with and without PCT involvement. Propensity score 
matching was used to estimate the effect of PCTs on costs of hospital care. 
Additionally, gamma regression models were estimated to assess predictors of 
hospital costs.
RESULTS: We included 535 patients of whom 126 received PCT consultation. 
Patients with PCT had a worse life expectancy (life expectancy <3 months: 62% 
vs. 31%, p < .01) and performance status (p < .01, e.g., WHO status higher than 
2:54% vs. 28%) and more often had no more options for anti-tumour therapy (57% 
vs. 30%, p < .01). Hospital length of stay, use of most diagnostic procedures, 
medication and other therapeutic interventions were similar. The total mean 
hospital costs were €8,393 for patients with and €8,631 for patients without PCT 
consultation. Analyses using propensity scores to control for observed 
confounding showed no significant difference in hospital costs.
CONCLUSIONS: PCT consultation for patients with cancer in Dutch hospitals often 
occurs late in the patients' disease trajectories, which might explain why we 
found no effect of PCT consultation on costs of hospital care. Earlier 
consultation could be beneficial to patients and reduce costs of care.

OBJECTIVE: Analysis of factors affecting life expectancy at patients with 
primary malignant tumors of anterior and middle parts of the skull base with 
intracranial invasion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 139 patients (47 women and 92 men) with primary malignant 
tumors of the anterior and middle parts of the skull base with intracranial 
invasion (stage T4 according to TNM classification or stage C according to 
Kadish classification for estesioneuroblast ) were treated at the NMRCN Burdenko 
for the period from 2004 till 2018. The study was conducted by the method of 
total sampling. The observations are divided into 2 groups: primarily operated 
(group I) and repeatedly operated (group II).
RESULTS: The average age in both groups was 50 years. In most (64.7%) cases, the 
tumor affected the medial sections of the base of anterior and middle cranial 
fossae, and in 35.3% of cases it was localized laterally. All tumors were 
classified to T4 stage according to TNM classification or (9 olfactory 
neuroblastomas) to stage C according to Kadish classification.
DISCUSSION: The impact on life expectancy was largely provided by postoperative 
radiation therapy, the repeated nature of operation, and the presence of brain 
infiltration. In the total cohort of patients 5-year OS, 5-year RVS, 5-year-old 
IDF and 5-year LC were 50.7, 35, 54.2 and 36.4%, respectively. In group I, the 
medians OS and IDF were equal and amounted to 138.3 months. The median RVS was 
43.8 months. 5-year OS equal to 63.6%, 5-year RVS - 40.8%, 5-year-IDF - 64.8%, 
5-year LC was up to 65.7%. The survival rate in the analyzed cohort for 1, 2, 3 
years was 81.4, 71.8 and 67.8%, respectively. In group II, the treatment results 
for the group of repeatedly treated patients were significantly worse. There 
were no cases of 5-year survival. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 
59.3, 50.8 and 31.8%, respectively. The median OS was 27.1 months, IDF was 27.1 
months, RVS was 18.2 months, and LC was 9.1 months.
CONCLUSION: The results and analysis of literature justify the feasibility of 
surgical treatment of patients with malignant tumors of craniofacial 
localization at T4 stage. The purpose of surgical intervention should be: 
elimination of the immediate threat to the patient's life due to edema and 
dislocation of the brain; the maximum possible removal of tumor tissue 
(cytoreduction); if possible, the elimination of the most significant symptoms 
for the patient (pain, nasal breathing disorders, cosmetic defect). If there are 
special reserves, it is obligatory to include radiation and chemotherapy in the 
treatment process.

Publisher: Цель исследования - анализ факторов, влияющих на продолжительность 
жизни и безрецидивного периода после первичных и повторных хирургических 
вмешательств у больных с первичными злокачественными опухолями передних и 
средних отделов основания черепа с интракраниальным распространением. Материал и 
методы. За период с 2004 по 2018 г. в ФГАУ 'НМИЦ нейрохирургии им. акад. Н.Н. 
Бурденко' Минздрава России прошли лечение 139 пациентов (47 женщин и 92 мужчины) 
с первичными злокачественными опухолями передних и средних отделов основания 
черепа с интракраниальным распространением (стадия T4 по классификации TNM или 
для эстезионейробластом - стадия С по классификации Kadish). Исследование 
проводилось методом тотальной выборки. Пациенты разделены на две группы: 
оперированные первично (1-я группа) и повторно (2-я группа). Результаты. Средний 
возраст пациентов обеих групп составил 50 лет. В большинстве (64,7%) случаев 
опухоль поражала медиальные отделы основания передней и средней черепных ямок, в 
35,3% локализовалась латерально. Все опухоли относились к T4 стадии по 
классификации TNM или (9 ольфакторных нейробластом) к стадии С по классификации 
Kadish. Влияние на продолжительность жизни в значительной степени оказывали 
послеоперационная лучевая терапия, повторная операция, наличие инфильтрации 
мозга. В общей когорте пациентов 5-летняя общая выживаемость (ОВ) , 5-летняя 
безрецидивная выживаемость (БРВ), 5-летняя выживаемость, обусловленная основным 
заболеванием (ВООЗ), и 5-летний локальный контроль (ЛК) опухоли составили 50,7, 
35,0, 54,2 и 36,4% соответственно. У пациентов 1-й группы медианы ОВ и ВООЗ были 
равны и составили 138,3 мес. Медиана БРВ составила 43,8 мес; 5-летняя ОВ - 
63,6%, 5-летняя БРВ - 40,8%, 5-летняя ВООЗ - 64,8%, 5-летний ЛК - 65,7%. 
Выживаемость в анализируемой когорте в течение 1, 2, 3 лет составила 81,4, 71,8 
и 67,8% соответственно. У пациентов 2-й группы результаты лечения были 
существенно хуже. Случаев 5-летней ОВ не зафиксировано. Выживаемость в течение 
1, 2, и 3 лет составила соответственно 59,3, 50,8, 31,8%. Медиана ОВ составила 
27,1 мес, ВООЗ - 27,1 мес, БРВ - 18,2 мес, ЛК - 9,1 мес. Выводы. Полученные 
результаты и анализ литературы позволяют обосновывать целесообразность 
хирургического лечения больных со злокачественными опухолями краниофациальной 
локализации Т4 стадии. Целями хирургического вмешательства должны быть 
устранение непосредственной угрозы для жизни больного, обусловленной отеком и 
дислокацией мозга; максимально возможное удаление ткани опухоли (циторедукция); 
при возможности - устранение наиболее важных для больного симптомов (болевого, 
нарушения носового дыхания, косметического дефекта). При наличии резервов 
обязательным является включение в комплекс лечения лучевой и химиотерапии.

BACKGROUND: Sapota is a popular tropical fruit characterized by a very short 
postharvest life. Low-temperature storage prolongs postharvest life of sapota 
fruit, but chilling injury symptoms can develop if the storage temperature is 
less than 14 °C. There have been no reports on the effects of postharvest 
melatonin application on the development of chilling injury in sapota fruit 
during cold storage. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects 
of different concentrations of postharvest melatonin application (0, 30, 60 and 
90 μmol L-1 ) during cold storage (8 °C) for up to 30 days with an additional 
1-day shelf life at ambient temperature.
RESULTS: All melatonin treatments reduced chilling injury symptoms, reduced 
electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, H2 O2 and superoxide anion 
(O2 - ), and increased proline content and the activity of superoxide dismutase 
(SOD), catalase (CAT) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and reduced the activities 
of phospholipase D (PLD) and lipoxygenase (LOX) compared to the control.
CONCLUSION: Postharvest melatonin treatment could be a useful strategy for 
reducing chilling injury during cold storage and transport of sapota fruit. The 
results indicate that melatonin reduces chilling injury of sapota fruit through 
maintaining membrane integrity, SOD and CAT activities, and reducing PLD and LOX 
activities. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

A Case Study With Symbihand: An sEMG-Controlled Electrohydraulic Hand Orthosis 
for Individuals With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Bos RA, Nizamis K, Koopman BFJM, Herder JL, Sartori M, Plettenburg DH.

With recent improvements in healthcare, individuals with Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD) have prolonged life expectancy, and it is therefore vital to 
preserve their independence. Hand function plays a central role in maintaining 
independence in daily living. This requires sufficient grip force and the 
ability to modulate it with no substantially added effort. Individuals with DMD 
have low residual grip force and its modulation is challenging and fatiguing. To 
assist their hand function, we developed a novel dynamic hand orthosis called 
SymbiHand, where the user's hand motor intention is decoded by means of surface 
electromyography, enabling the control of an electrohydraulic pump for 
actuation. Mechanical work is transported using hydraulic transmission and 
flexible structures to redirect interaction forces, enhancing comfort by 
minimizing shear forces. This paper outlines SymbiHand's design and control, and 
a case study with an individual with DMD. Results show that SymbiHand increased 
the participant's maximum grasping force from 2.4 to 8 N. During a grasping 
force-tracking task, muscular activation was decreased by more than 40% without 
compromising task performance. These results suggest that SymbiHand has the 
potential to decrease muscular activation and increase grasping force for 
individuals with DMD, adding to the hand a total mass of no more than 241 g. 
Changes in mass distributions and an active thumb support are necessary for 
improved usability, in addition to larger-scale studies for generalizing its 
assistive potential.

BACKGROUND: The demography of Botswana is rapidly changing. Successes in 
tackling communicable diseases and economic development increased life 
expectancy from 53.7 years in 2006 to 66.8 years in 2016. The prevalence of 
diseases associated with older age, especially chronic non-communicable diseases 
including diabetes, hypertension and cerebrovascular disease are suspected to 
have increased but accurate data are lacking. The country has high youth 
unemployment and national retirement is at the age of 60, which limits the 
opportunity to build pensions for prosperity in older age. Changes across 
health, social care and economic policy are needed to prepare for a future 
ageing population.
METHODS: This article reports on the national working group meeting outputs on 
issues that face older people, their families, healthcare providers, and policy 
makers in Botswana. A collaborative working group meeting was convened in 
Gaborone, Botswana on 25th September 2018 by the University of Botswana and 
University of Birmingham, UK, to identify key challenges and opportunities for 
an ageing Batswana population.
RESULTS: There was agreement across diverse stakeholders of a need for effective 
and rapid policy formation to prepare and protect the future health and economy 
of an ageing Batswana population with a high burden of NCDs. The main priorities 
for policy-makers must be social care, poverty reduction and healthcare 
provision, conducted in an evidence-based manner, as far as practicable. To 
effectively achieve this, research and high-quality data collection mechanisms 
are required.
CONCLUSIONS: Future policy in Botswana must focus on the challenges that an 
ageing population brings, and development of health and care system resilience 
for the demographic change could be a model for healthcare policy across 
Southern Africa.

Introduction As proven by many previous studies, physical inactivity is 
associated with many diseases, including heart conditions and cancer. The 
elimination of physical inactivity helps increase life expectancy and reduce 
morbidity. Nonadherence to exercise is a common problem faced by many people. 
The goal of this study was to determine the percentage of people in the Indian 
population who regularly exercise. We also assessed factors for nonadherence, 
motivating factors, and the intensity of exercise usually performed and explored 
any association between adherence to exercise and demographic factors. Materials 
and methods We conducted an anonymous questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study 
in an adult Indian population (participants were older than 18 years) from rural 
and urban areas having no contraindication to at least some form of voluntary 
exercise. Data were collected via email by sending a questionnaire, and an 
appropriate statistical methodology was used to derive the results. Results This 
study included 220 individuals older than 18 years, and most participants were 
aged 25 to 30 years (35.5%). Most participants (67.3%) were women, and 32.7% 
were men. Forty-one percent of the total population reported suffering from some 
medical condition. Nearly half (51.8%) of the subjects were involved in physical 
activity, and 48.2% were not involved in physical activity. The most common 
reason for not exercising was a lack of time followed by a lack of motivation. 
Maintenance of good health was the main reported benefit of physical exercise, 
with self-motivation being the main motivator. Low-intensity exercise was the 
preferred form of exercise for most of the participants; high-intensity exercise 
was preferred by younger participants, though less commonly than low-intensity 
exercise. Older participants (i.e., those aged > 40 years) preferred 
moderate-intensity exercise. Only half the study population were educated 
regarding physical activity by a healthcare professional. We found no 
statistically significant association between the presence of a medical 
condition, body mass index (BMI), or healthcare education and adherence to 
exercise. Conclusion The inclusion of exercise in a daily routine is one of the 
more important lifestyle changes advised for all ailments and for improvements 
in patient quality of life. Nearly half the Indian population does not exercise 
daily. Because we found no statistical significance between demographic factors, 
health conditions, BMI, or general healthcare education, an individualized 
education and exercise plan may help improve exercise adherence.

PURPOSE: Hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) is a frequent cause of 
hospitalization and a common comorbidity in hospitalized patients. There are few 
studies addressing what factors might predict poor outcomes in this patient 
population. The purpose of the current study was to investigate characteristics 
and outcomes of patients hospitalized with HRF.
METHODS: A study of patients ≥ 18 years admitted with HRF in a 1-year period. 
Patients with limited life expectancy related to other conditions, and those 
with a non-respiratory cause of HRF, were excluded.
RESULTS: 202 subjects met eligibility criteria: 24% had a diagnosis of 
obstructive sleep apnea, 6% obesity hypoventilation, 46% chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and 10% asthma. Fifteen (7%) died during the index admission. 
Forty-one patients (23%) were readmitted within 30 days: peripheral vascular 
disease [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.78, CI 1.45-15.74] and tachycardia (aOR 
2.97, CI 1.22-7.26) were associated with an increased risk of readmission. 
Sixty-six patients (36%) died after discharge. Risk of death was increased in 
older patients (aOR 1.32, CI 1.13-1.54 per 5 years), those with peripheral 
vascular disease (aOR 12.56, CI 2.35-67.21), higher Charlson co-morbidity index 
(aOR 1.39, CI 1.09-1.76), use of home oxygen (aOR 4.03, CI 1.89-8.57), and those 
who had been readmitted (aOR 3.07, CI 1.46-6.43).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for HRF is associated with a high morbidity and 
mortality. Our observation that home oxygen use was associated with increased 
mortality suggests that oxygen use could be a risk factor for death in patients 
with HRF.

BACKGROUND: Intrathecal opioid pumps have been used in the management of severe 
chronic pain for more than 40 years. Numerous studies have shown significant 
therapeutic effects alongside tolerable side effects. In the last decades, life 
expectancy has increased in many countries in the world. With an aging 
population, the question arises whether effects equal to those in younger 
patients can also be achieved in elderly patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is an in-depth re-analysis of data published 
previously. 36 patients were analyzed. The sample included 18 elderly patients 
(> 65 years) and 18 younger patients.
RESULTS: No differences between the two samples were found with regard to pain 
intensity under intrathecal opioid therapy and prior to implantation of the 
opioid pump. Likewise, there were no differences in anxiety/depression scores 
and pain-related disability. Side effects were reported at similar rates by the 
elderly patients and by the younger patients. Elderly patients showed a tendency 
towards lower opioid doses and slower dose increases.
CONCLUSION: Our data hint at a consistent efficacy of intrathecal opioid therapy 
in elderly patients even after long-term treatment. Side effects of the 
treatment are relatively frequent but mild and no side effects were particularly 
frequent in elderly people.

Background: Childhood obesity, including overweight, continues increasing 
worldwide affecting health expectancy, quality of life and healthcare 
expenditure. These subjects have higher probability of suffering or developing 
cardio metabolic risk factors. Recent studies have revealed cardiorespiratory 
fitness (CRF) as a valuable clinical parameter to identify these subjects and 
have even suggested cut-off values. However, evaluating CRF in overweight and 
obese youth can be difficult to implement, unfriendly and expensive.Objective: 
Develop a screening tool to identify high-risk subjects in a representative 
population of those attending overweight/obesity assessment programmes without 
prior intervention. It will be based on heart rate variability parameters, which 
has strong association with CRF and cardio metabolic risk factors.Methods: 
Sixty-three subjects, overweight and obese, between 9 and 17 years of age, and 
of both sexes were enrolled. None of them had secondary obesity syndromes and/or 
suffered from acute or chronic disease. Anthropometric parameters, 
electrocardiogram signal recording under resting conditions and 
cardiorespiratory fitness - evaluated by oxygen consumption and time elapsed of 
cardiopulmonary exercise test - were measured.Results: Significant differences 
in the sympathetic nervous system activity - assessed by heart rate variability 
analysis - are observed when grouping by overweight and obesity degree as well 
as by CRF (poor/normal). Body mass index, puberty and sympathetic nervous system 
activity are the significant variables of a logistic regression model develop to 
identify poor CRF individuals. Its accuracy reaches 92%.Conclusions: A screening 
tool based on heart rate variability and anthropometric parameters was developed 
to identify subjects with higher probability of suffering or developing cardio 
metabolic risk factors.
