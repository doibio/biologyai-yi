BACKGROUND: Lower-limb peripheral artery disease is one of the major 
complications of diabetes. Peripheral artery disease is associated with poor 
limb and cardiovascular prognoses, along with a dramatic decrease in life 
expectancy. Despite major medical advances in the treatment of diabetes, a 
substantial therapeutic gap remains in the peripheral artery disease population. 
Praliciguat is an orally available sGC (soluble guanylate cyclase) stimulator 
that has been reported both preclinically and in early stage clinical trials to 
have favorable effects in metabolic and hemodynamic outcomes, suggesting that it 
may have a potential beneficial effect in peripheral artery disease.
METHODS: We evaluated the effect of praliciguat on hind limb ischemia recovery 
in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Hind limb ischemia was induced in leptin 
receptor-deficient (Leprdb/db) mice by ligation and excision of the left femoral 
artery. Praliciguat (10 mg/kg/day) was administered in the diet starting 3 days 
before surgery.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight days after surgery, ischemic foot perfusion and function 
parameters were better in praliciguat-treated mice than in vehicle controls. 
Improved ischemic foot perfusion was not associated with either improved 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors (ie, weight, glycemia) or increased 
angiogenesis. However, treatment with praliciguat significantly increased 
arteriole diameter, decreased ICAM1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) 
expression, and prevented the accumulation of oxidative proangiogenic and 
proinflammatory muscle fibers. While investigating the mechanism underlying the 
beneficial effects of praliciguat therapy, we found that praliciguat 
significantly downregulated Myh2 and Cxcl12 mRNA expression in cultured 
myoblasts and that conditioned medium form praliciguat-treated myoblast 
decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression in endothelial cells. These results suggest that 
praliciguat therapy may decrease ICAM1 expression in endothelial cells by 
downregulating Cxcl12 in myocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that praliciguat promotes blood flow 
recovery in the ischemic muscle of mice with type 2 diabetes, at least in part 
by increasing arteriole diameter and by downregulating ICAM1 expression.

OBJECTIVE: Muscular flaps may represent a valid treatment option for prosthetic 
infection after knee arthroplasty.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the results of 20 consecutive patients treated 
with the use of medial gastrocnemius flap for the management of different types 
of injuries or integumentary defects after total knee arthroplasty. Tissue 
necrosis or dehiscence occurred within 1 and 2 months after arthroplasty. The 
mean follow-up was 23.4 (12-60) months. Clinical outcome was evaluated according 
to the infection control rate and post-operative Knee Society Score (KSS).
RESULTS: Prosthesis salvage and complete restoration of skin coverage were 
achieved in all patients. Functional assessment was performed using the KSS 
score. The final knee KSS score was classified as excellent (score: 80-100) in 0 
patients, good (score: 70-79) in 17 patients, fair (score: 60-69) in 2 patients, 
and poor (score: 60) in 1 patient. Residual Extension Deficit: 0-20°; Very 
Satisfactory in 17 patients. 30-70° Satisfactory in 2 patients, 80-90° 
Unsatisfactory in 1 patient. Patients who successfully underwent flap treatment 
experienced a much greater increase in both components of the KSS score.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the effectiveness of medial gastrocnemius 
muscular flap for the treatment of prosthetic knee infection, in terms of 
function, limb salvage, cost-effectiveness and post-surgery quality of life. 
Further larger studies may consolidate these findings.

OBJECTIVE: The IlluminOss® System (IS) based on photodynamic bone stabilization 
(PBS) is a recent option in between the minimally invasive surgical techniques 
available to treat bone metastases when medical or radiation therapy is neither 
effective nor indicated, and major surgery is not possible. In this study, the 
results obtained using IS in the treatment of impending fractures or bone 
metastases of the upper limb have been analyzed in terms of improvement in pain, 
quality of life and recovery of function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2017 and October 2019, 8 patients over 65 
years old with impending fractures or pathological fractures or myeloma of the 
upper limb have been treated in our institute with IS. All patients were 
assessed about pain, general health and function of the affected limb before 
surgery and 1, 3, 6 (consistent with survival) months after the procedure.
RESULTS: Mean VAS score improved from 8.88 before surgery to 1.00 six months 
after surgery, mean Karnofsky index improved at 1 and 3 months post-operative 
follow-up, and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score (MSTS) raised from 44.6 
before surgery to 74.7 six months after surgery. Moreover, good reduction and 
stable fixation of the osteolytic lesion were achieved in all patients, and no 
complications were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous studies have been reported in the literature on the use of 
this system in osteoporotic elderly fractures, whereas only few articles are 
currently available regarding its use in the treatment of bone metastases or 
pathological fractures. From our study PBS seems to be an effective solution in 
the management of bone metastases or myeloma in both pathological fractures and 
impending upper limb fractures in patients with low life expectancy.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Because of increasing life expectancy, there is an 
increasing number of cognitively impaired older individuals undergoing surgeries 
such as groin hernia repair. Here, we evaluated the effects of cognitive status 
on postoperative complication rates in patients undergoing groin hernia repair 
using various anesthesia techniques. We also analyzed the rate of same-day 
hernia surgery in patients with cognitive decline.
METHODS: Patients who presented to our general surgery clinic for unilateral or 
bilateral inguinal or femoral hernia were prospectively classified into general 
(group 1), local (group 2), and spinal (group 3) anesthesia groups. The 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for preoperative evaluation of 
each patient's cognitive status. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to 
evaluate postoperative pain. Groups were compared in terms of age, MMSE and VAS 
scores, cognitive decline and complication rates, and surgery duration.
RESULTS: In total, 33 (35.1%), 30 (31.9%), and 31 (33.0%) of 94 patients 
underwent surgery using general, local, and spinal anesthesia, respectively. The 
mean MMSE score did not differ among groups (p = 0.518). Cognitive decline was 
present in 18 (19.2%) patients, and the proportion did not significantly differ 
among groups. The complication rate did not differ between patients with and 
without cognitive decline. The mean surgery duration was similar among the three 
groups (p = 0.127). Group 2 had a lower mean postoperative VAS score, compared 
with the other groups (p < 0.001). Complications because of anesthesia and 
surgery were significantly more common in group 3 than in the other groups 
(p = 0.025). In the local anesthesia group, 7 patients had cognitive decline and 
22 patients had normal cognition. There were no significant differences between 
patients with and without cognitive decline in terms of mean surgery duration 
(50.3 ± 15.4 min vs. 45.2 ± 10.7 min; p = 0.338) or mean VAS score (3.14 ± 0.90 
vs. 3.13 ± 0.77; p = 0.985). Among the 22 and 7 patients without and with 
cognitive decline, 11 (50%) and 0 patients were discharged on the same day 
(p = 0.025). In the local anesthesia group, the respective median ages were 70, 
52, and 59 years for patients with cognitive decline, patients with normal 
cognition discharged on the same day, and patients with normal cognition who 
were not discharged on the same day (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Groin hernia repair was successfully performed under local 
anesthesia in all patients, including older patients with cognitive decline. 
Patients with cognitive decline were not discharged on the day of surgery, 
although the mean surgery duration and postoperative VAS score did not differ 
between patients with and without cognitive decline. Prolonged hospitalization 
in patients with cognitive decline may be related to their advanced age. Further 
studies are needed to determine the safety of same-day surgery in patients with 
cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can bring HIV-1 levels in blood plasma 
to the undetectable level and allow a near-normal life expectancy for 
HIV-infected individuals. Unfortunately, ART is not curative and must be taken 
for life, because within a few weeks of treatment cessation, HIV viremia 
rebounds in most patients except for rare elite or posttreatment controllers of 
viremia. The primary source of this rebound is the highly stable reservoir of 
latent yet replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses integrated into the genomic 
DNA of the resting memory cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T cells. To 
achieve a cure for HIV, understanding the cell reservoir environment is of 
paramount importance. The size and nature of the viral reservoir might vary 
according to the timing of therapy, therapeutic response, ART duration, and 
immune response. The mechanisms of reservoir maintenance generally depend on the 
levels/type of immune recognition; in addition, the dynamics of viral 
persistence are different between pediatric and adult populations. This 
difference could become more evident as children grow toward adolescence.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to characterize the HIV reservoirs and their variability as 
per the virological and immunological profiles of HIV-1 non-B vertically 
infected adolescents receiving ART in Cameroon during the Adolescents' Viral 
Reservoirs study to provide accurate and reliable data for HIV cure research.
METHODS: This study will involve HIV-1 non-B vertically infected adolescents 
selected from an existing cohort in our institution. Blood samples will be 
collected for analyzing immunological/virological profiles, including CD4/CD8 
count, plasma viral load, immune activation/inflammatory markers, genotyping, 
and quantification of HIV-1 viral reservoirs. We will equally recruit an 
age-matched group of HIV-negative adolescents as control for immunological 
profiling.
RESULTS: This study received funding in November 2021 and was approved by the 
national institutional review board in December 2021. Sample collection will 
start in November 2022, and the study will last for 18 months. The HIV-1 
sequences generated will provide information on the circulating HIV-1 subtypes 
to guide the selection of the most appropriate ART for the participants. The 
levels of immune biomarkers will help determine the immune profile and help 
identify factors driving persistent immune activation/inflammation in 
HIV-infected adolescents compared to those in HIV-uninfected adolescents. 
Analysis of the virological and immunological parameters in addition to the 
HIV-1 reservoir size will shed light on the characteristics of the viral 
reservoir in adolescents with HIV-1 non-B infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help in advancing the knowledge on HIV 
reservoirs, in terms of size and genetic variability in adolescents living with 
HIV. Such evidence will also help in understanding the effects of ART timing and 
duration on the size of the reservoirs among adolescents living with HIV-a 
unique population from whom the findings generated will largely contribute to 
designing functional cure strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death not only in the young 
population but also in the elderly. There are no consensus treatment guidelines 
for elderly breast cancer patients. We purposed to discuss surgical treatment 
options for breast cancer cases over 80 years concerning morbidity and 
mortality.
METHODS: This retrospective study includes 58 patients over 80 years of age at 
the time of surgery for breast cancer between 2006 and 2017. A sum of 58 cases 
(54 females and 4 males), over 80 years of age, with an average age of 84.5±4.07 
(80-94) years were included in the study. The modified radical mastectomy was 
the most common surgical modality in 30 (51.7%) cases, and the axillary 
intervention was performed on 41 (70.7%). Axillary dissection and sentinel lymph 
node biopsy were performed for 30 (51.7%) and 11 (18.9%) cases, respectively.
RESULTS: Minor and major complications were observed in 8 (13.8%) cases. The 
average follow-up period of the patients was 37.5 (1-120) months. During the 
follow-up period, breast cancer-related mortality was observed in 9 (15.52%) 
cases. No statistical differences were detected in mortality with/without 
axillary intervention and chosen surgical modality.
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity, the American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and 
life expectancy should be considered in the management and surgical planning of 
patients over 80 years of age with breast cancer. Minimally invasive approaches 
should be preferred for the elderly whenever feasible and applicable in the 
light of oncologic surgery principles in order to reduce complications and 
mortality rates.

The development of metastasis severely reduces the life expectancy of patients 
with colorectal cancer (CRC). Although loss of SMAD4 is a key event in CRC 
progression, the resulting changes in biological processes in advanced disease 
and metastasis are not fully understood. Here, we applied a multiomics approach 
to a CRC organoid model that faithfully reflects the metastasis-supporting 
effects of SMAD4 inactivation. We show that loss of SMAD4 results in decreased 
differentiation and activation of pro-migratory and cell proliferation 
processes, which is accompanied by the disruption of several key oncogenic 
pathways, including the TGFβ, WNT, and VEGF pathways. In addition, SMAD4 
inactivation leads to increased secretion of proteins that are known to be 
involved in a variety of pro-metastatic processes. Finally, we show that one of 
the factors that is specifically secreted by SMAD4-mutant organoids─DKK3─reduces 
the antitumor effects of natural killer cells (NK cells). Altogether, our data 
provide new insights into the role of SMAD4 perturbation in advanced CRC.

BACKGROUND: There is still uncertainty on whether ionizing radiation from CT 
scans can increase the risks of cancer. This study aimed to identify the 
association of cumulative ionizing radiation from CT scans with pertaining 
cancer risks in adults.
METHODS: Five databases were searched from their inception to November 15, 2020. 
Observational studies reporting cancer risks from CT scans in adults were 
included. The main outcome included quantified cancer risks as cancer case 
numbers in exposed/unexposed adult participants with unified converted measures 
to odds ratio (OR) for relative risk, hazard ratio. Global background radiation 
(2.4 mSv per year) was used as control for lifetime attribution risk (LAR), with 
the same period from incubation after exposure until survival to 100 years.
RESULTS: 25 studies were included with a sum of 111,649,943 participants (mean 
age: 45.37 years, 83.4% women), comprising 2,049,943 actual participants from 6 
studies with an average follow-up period as 30.1 years (range, 5 to 80 years); 
109,600,000 participants from 19 studies using LAR. The cancer risks for adults 
following CT scans were inordinately increased (LAR adults, OR, 10.00 [95% CI, 
5.87 to 17.05]; actual adults, OR, 1.17 [95%CI, 0.89 to 1.55]; combined, OR, 
5.89 [95%CI, 3.46 to 10.35]). Moreover, cancer risks elevated with increase of 
radiation dose (OR, 33.31 [95% CI, 21.33 to 52.02]), and multiple CT scan sites 
(OR, 14.08 [95% CI, 6.60 to 30.05]). The risk of solid malignancy was higher 
than leukemia. Notably, there were no significant differences for age, gender, 
country, continent, study quality and studying time phrases.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on 111.6 million adult participants from 3 continents (Asia, 
Europe and America), this meta-analysis identifies an inordinately increase in 
cancer risks from CT scans for adults. Moreover, the cancer risks were 
positively correlated with radiation dose and CT sites. The meta-analysis 
highlights the awareness of potential cancer risks of CT scans as well as more 
reasonable methodology to quantify cancer risks in terms of life expectancy as 
100 years for LAR.

INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest that hepatitis C virus (HCV) micro-elimination is 
feasible among men who have sex with men (MSM) living with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), through treatment-as-prevention and interventions 
aimed at reducing risk behaviours. However, their economic impact is poorly 
understood. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of HCV 
screening and risk reduction strategies in France.
METHODS: A compartmental deterministic mathematical model was developed to 
describe HCV disease transmission and progression among MSM living with HIV in 
France. We evaluated different combinations of HCV screening frequency (every 
12, 6 or 3 months) and risk reduction strategies (targeting only high-risk or 
all MSM) from 2021 onwards. The model simulated the number of HCV infections, 
life-expectancy (LYs), quality-adjusted life-expectancy (QALYs), lifetime costs 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a lifetime horizon (leading 
to an end of the simulation in 2065).
RESULTS: All strategies increased QALYs, compared with current practices, that 
is yearly HCV screening, with no risk reduction. A behavioural intervention 
resulting in a 20% risk reduction in the high-risk group, together with yearly 
screening, was the least expensive strategy, and, therefore, cost-saving 
compared to current practices. The ICER per QALY gained for the strategy 
combining risk reduction for the high-risk group with 6-month HCV screening, 
compared to risk reduction with yearly screening, was €61,389. It also prevented 
398 new HCV infections between 2021 and 2065, with a cost per infection averted 
of €37,790. All other strategies were dominated (more expensive and less 
effective than some other available alternative) or not cost-effective (ICER per 
QALY gained > €100,000).
CONCLUSIONS: In the French context, current HCV screening practices without risk 
reduction among MSM living with HIV cannot be justified on economic grounds. 
Risk reduction interventions targeted to high-risk individuals-alongside 
screening either once or twice a year-could be cost-effective depending on the 
policymaker's willingness-to-pay.

The incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma (EA) has increased worldwide in 
recent years due to the widespread use of estrogen therapy and the overall 
increase in life expectancy. However, we know of no sensitive molecular index 
that can be used to predict the onset of EA, evaluate the therapeutic effects of 
treatment agents, or provide prognostic benefit in post-treatment follow-up. To 
explore the correlation between human olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) and the 
clinicopathologic parameters of EA, and to determine the precise involvement of 
OLFM4 as a related factor in the occurrence and development of EA. We enrolled 
61 gynecologic patients for a retrospective study at the Tai'an Central Hospital 
of Shandong Province from January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2022. We determined the 
expression levels of estrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), and 
OLFM4 proteins in endometrial tissue with the immunohistochemical S-P staining 
method, and analyzed the correlations among ERα, PR, and OLFM4 protein 
expression levels and with the pathologic stage, histologic grade, myometrial 
invasiveness, and lymphatic metastasis of EA. The expression levels of OLFM4 in 
EA were higher than in normal endometrium (P = .036). The expression level of 
OLFM4 protein in stage II-III patients was higher than that in stage I patients 
(P = .034), and the expression levels of ERα and PR proteins in EA were lower 
than those in normal endometrial tissue (P = .014 and P = .0005). While we 
observed no correlation in endometrial tissues of disparate pathologic types 
between OLFM4 and the expression levels of ERα and PR proteins, we noted a 
positive correlation between the expression levels of ERα and PR protein. The 
expression level of OLFM4 protein increased with the malignant degree of 
endometrial lesions and OLFM4 protein expression was related to the FIGO stage 
of EA. And OLFM4 protein can be used as 1 of the potential diagnostic factors 
for endometrial lesions, which is worthy of further study.

China.

To analyze the change trend of life expectancy, the change trend of premature 
death due to 4 major chronic diseases, and its impact on the life expectancy of 
Wuhai residents from 2015 to 2020, and to provide evidence for the prevention 
and control of chronic diseases in this area. The data on population death comes 
from the Wuhai City Residents' Causes of Death Network Reporting System and the 
total population is calculated using statistics from Wuhai City's permanent 
population management, from 2015 to 2020. Premature mortality from the 4 main 
chronic illnesses was calculated using the abridged life table approach. The 
impact of premature death from chronic diseases on life expectancy was analyzed 
using the Arriaga method. The increasing trend of life expectancy of Wuhai 
citizens was not statistically significant from 2015 to 2020 (t = 2.570, 
P = .062). Each year, men had a lower life expectancy than women (P < .05). From 
2015 to 2020, the downward trend of premature deaths caused by the 4 major 
non-communicable diseases in Wuhai City was statistically significant 
(EAPC = -7.74%, P = .041). Premature death from cancer and chronic respiratory 
disorders decreased, both of which were statistically significant (EAPC < 0, 
P < .05). The decline in premature mortality from cancer, cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular disorders, and chronic respiratory system diseases has 
contributed to increased life expectancy. Diabetes's rise in premature mortality 
made a possible "negative contribution" to life expectancy (-0.036 years, 
-1.79%). From 2015 to 2020, the decreasing trend of the overall premature 
mortality caused by the 4 major non-communicable diseases in Wuhai was 
statistically significant, and the life expectancy of females was higher than 
that of males. We should concentrate on the prevention and control of major 
chronic illnesses in males, as well as the influence of changes in 
diabetes-related early mortality on life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: To fully understand the clinical features and prognosis of 
Glioblastoma (GBM), we extracted the data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER) database and performed a series of analyses.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 1674 patients with GBM obtained 
from the SEER database from 1983 to 2015. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to 
calculate the survival rate, and the log-rank test was used to analyze the 
survival outcomes.
RESULTS: Older patients with GBM had a worse survival period (P < .05). 
Laterality had no effect on the prognosis (P > .05). Patients with high-grade 
gliomas may have a shorter lifespan (P < .05). In terms of overall survival (OS) 
and disease specificity, all 3 classical treatments failed to improve the life 
expectancy (P > .05). In adult patients with GBM, we found that age, tumor 
grade, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were independent risk factors for 
all-cause mortality. In the univariate disease-specific analysis, age, tumor 
grade, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were independent risk factors. 
However, in multivariate disease-specific analysis, the results showed that only 
tumor grade and surgery were independent risk factors for GBM.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients diagnosed with GBM have worse survival, and patients 
with glioma of higher grades have a shorter lifespan. Age, grade, surgery, 
radiation therapy, and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for 
patients with GBM.

Rupture of the distal biceps tendon typically occurs after an eccentric 
extension load is applied to the elbow. Chronic distal biceps ruptures are 
uncommon and are complicated by tendon, muscle retraction, and tissue atrophy. 
Here, we present the case of a 26-year-old male soldier. The patient was a 
smoker on steroids and growth hormones. He had a distal biceps tendon rupture 
for two months following weightlifting. He had a positive hook test, and the 
tendon could not be palpated in his antecubital fossa. Despite trying 
conservative treatment earlier, he complained of weakness and was unhappy with 
the cosmetic appearance of his arm. He underwent a successful distal biceps 
tendon reconstruction with an allograft. At the three-month follow-up after the 
surgery, the patient reported a full range of motion and strength and was able 
to return to his daily life activities. In addition, the aesthetic appearance of 
the biceps muscle was restored.

BACKGROUND: Low-back pain (LBP) is a major public health problem globally and 
its direct and indirect healthcare costs are growing rapidly. Virtual reality 
involving the use of video games or non-game applications are alternatives to 
conventional face-to-face physical therapy for LBP. The purpose of this study 
was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Back Extension-Virtual Reality Game 
(BE-VRG) compared to Clinic-based McKenzie therapy (CBMT) for chronic 
non-specific LBP in Nigeria.
METHODS: Patients with chronic non-specific LBP were randomised into either 
BE-VRG or CBMT group. Patients' level of disability was assessed using Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) at week 4 and week 8. ODI was mapped to SF-6D to generate 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) used for cost-effectiveness analysis. 
Resource use and costs were assessed based on rehabilitation services from a 
healthcare perspective. Cost-effectiveness analysis which included direct 
healthcare costs was conducted. Incremental cost per QALY was also calculated.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients (BE-VRG, n = 22; CBMT, n = 24) with the mean (±SD) 
age of 32.6 ± (11.5) years for BE-VRG and 48.8 ± (10.2) years for CBMT 
intervention completed in this study. The mean direct health costs per patient 
were USD100.67 and USD106.3 for BE-VRG and CBMT, respectively. The mean quality 
adjusted life years at week 4 and week 8 were (BE-VRG, 0.0574 ± (0.002); CBMT, 
0.0548 ± (0.002)); and (BE-VRG; 0.116 ± (0.002); CBMT; 0.114 ± (0.004)), 
respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio showed that BE-VRG arm was 
less costly and more effective than CBMT.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that BE-VRG was cost saving for 
chronic non-specific LBP compared to CBMT. This evidence could guide policy 
makers, payers and clinicians in evaluating BE-VRG as a treatment option for 
people with chronic non-specific LBP.

Treatment of lower limb chronic venous disease has progressed exponentially over 
recent decades. The advances achieved have made it possible to develop a 
proposal for a systematized intravenous laser ablation technique - assisted 
total thermal ablation (ATTA). The technique constitutes a standardized method 
for management of axial or tributary veins that are varicosed or esthetically 
unappealing, whether in the lower limbs or other areas, that can be performed on 
an outpatient or day-hospital basis. This article describes the processes for 
preoperative preparation and detailed marking, the materials needed, venous 
access, anesthesia, calculation of power and energy, the ablation technique 
itself, follow-up, and adverse events. The ATTA technique is proposed as a tool 
for treatment of chronic venous disease and of esthetically unappealing veins, 
suggesting possible extension of the applications for lasers beyond trunk veins 
to any vein that can be punctured.

O tratamento da doença venosa crônica dos membros inferiores evoluiu de forma 
exponencial nas últimas décadas. Tais avanços permitiram o desenvolvimento de 
uma proposta de execução técnica sistematizada para o tratamento de ablação 
endovenosa com laser, a ablação térmica total assistida (ATTA). A técnica propõe 
um método padronizado de abordagem das veias axiais ou tributárias, varicosas ou 
inestéticas, de membros inferiores ou outros territórios, em regime ambulatorial 
ou de hospital-dia. Foram descritos os processos de preparo pré-operatório, 
marcação detalhada, materiais necessários, acessos venosos, anestesia, cálculo 
de potência e energia, a técnica de ablação, seguimento e eventos adversos. A 
ATTA é proposta como uma ferramenta para o tratamento da doença venosa crônica e 
das veias inestéticas, sugerindo possíveis expansões para as aplicações do 
laser, além dos troncos venosos, para toda veia passível de ser puncionada.

The eyeball and the orbit are neighbours of the ENT region. This close 
proximity, makes the involvement of the orbit and there of ophthalmological 
manifestations fairly common in the practise of Otorhinolaryngology. This was a 
prospective study. All the patients presenting with ophthalmological 
manifestations due to various ear, nose, throat and head-neck pathologies were 
constituted in this study. This study was carried out on 50 patients of all age 
groups with ophthalmological complications along with ENT diseases who came to 
the department of ENT and head-neck surgery and department of Ophthalmology of 
N.S.C.B. Government Medical College, Jabalpur from August 2018 to August 2019. 
The diseases of ENT with orbital extension must be considered whenever a patient 
presents with signs and symptoms of orbital disease such as proptosis, orbital 
mass, restriction of eye movements, neurological dysfunction of eye, chemosis, 
vision disturbances or epiphora. A firmer knowledge of orbital anatomy with 
respect to sinonasal region is required for any surgeon dealing with this 
important area, for a safer and more secure management in this complex region. 
Surgery remains the main stay of treatment for sinonasal diseases with orbital 
complications. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are of utmost importance in 
preserving vision and life in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Leukemia caused by occupational risk is a problem that needs more 
attention and remains to be solved urgently, especially for acute lymphoid 
leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic lymphoid leukemia 
(CLL). However, there is a paucity of literature on this issue. We aimed to 
assess the global burden and trends of leukemia attributable to occupational 
risk from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: This observational trend study was based on the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2019 database, the global deaths, and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), which were calculated to quantify the changing trend of leukemia 
attributable to occupational risk, were analyzed by age, year, geographical 
location, and socio-demographic index (SDI), and the corresponding estimated 
annual percentage change (EAPC) values were calculated.
RESULTS: Global age-standardized DALYs and death rates of leukemia attributable 
to occupational risk presented significantly decline trends with EAPC [-0.38% 
(95% CI: -0.58 to -0.18%) for DALYs and -0.30% (95% CI: -0.45 to -0.146%) for 
death]. However, it was significantly increased in people aged 65-69 years 
[0.42% (95% CI: 0.30-0.55%) for DALYs and 0.38% (95% CI: 0.26-0.51%) for death]. 
At the same time, the age-standardized DALYs and death rates of ALL, AML, and 
CLL were presented a significantly increased trend with EAPCs [0.78% (95% CI: 
0.65-0.91%), 0.87% (95% CI: 0.81-0.93%), and 0.66% (95% CI: 0.51-0.81%) for 
DALYs, respectively, and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.68-0.82%), 0.96% (95% CI: 0.91-1.01%), 
and 0.55% (95% CI: 0.43-0.68%) for death], respectively. The ALL, AML, and CLL 
were shown an upward trend in almost all age groups.
CONCLUSION: We observed a substantial reduction in leukemia due to occupational 
risks between 1990 and 2019. However, the people aged 65-69 years and burdens of 
ALL, AML, and CLL had a significantly increased trend in almost all age groups. 
Thus, there remains an urgent need to accelerate efforts to reduce leukemia 
attributable to occupational risk-related death burden in this population and 
specific causes.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with the estimated 
lifetime risk of revision surgery after primary knee arthroplasty (KA).
METHODS: All patients from the Scottish Arthroplasty Project dataset undergoing 
primary KA during the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2019 were included. 
The cumulative incidence function for revision and death was calculated up to 20 
years. Adjusted analyses used cause-specific Cox regression modelling to 
determine the influence of patient factors. The lifetime risk was calculated as 
a percentage for patients aged between 45 and 99 years using multiple-decrement 
life table methodology.
RESULTS: The estimated lifetime risk of revision ranged between 32.7% (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 22.6 to 47.3) for patients aged 45 to 49 years and 0.6% 
(95% CI 0.1 to 4.5) for patients aged over 90 years. At 20 years, the overall 
cumulative incidence of revision (6.8% (95% CI 6.6 to 7.0)) was significantly 
less than that of death (66.3% (95% CI 65.4 to 67.1)). Adjusted analyses 
demonstrated converse effect of increasing age on risk of revision (hazard ratio 
(HR) 0.5 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.6)) and death (HR 3.6 (95% CI 3.4 to 3.7)). Male sex 
was associated with increased risks of revision (HR 1.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.2); p < 
0.001) and death (HR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.4); p < 0.001). Compared to patients 
undergoing primary KA for osteoarthritis, patients with inflammatory arthropathy 
had a higher risk of death (HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.7 to 1.8); p < 0.001), but were 
less likely to be revised (HR 0.9 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.0); p < 0.001). Patients with 
a greater number of comorbidities (HR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.4)) and greater 
levels of socioeconomic deprivation (HR 1.4 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.5)) were at 
increased risk of death, but neither increased the risk of revision.
CONCLUSION: The estimated lifetime risk of revision KA varied depending on 
patient sex, age, and underlying diagnosis. Patients aged between 45 and 49 
years had a one in three risk of undergoing revision surgery within their 
lifetime, which decreased with age to one in 159 in those aged 90 years or 
more.Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2022;104-B(12):1313-1322.
