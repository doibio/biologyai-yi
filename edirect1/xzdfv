the proportion for each mortality class differed substantially. Mortality 
increased with increasing internal nest-tunnel temperature, and nest boxes with 
parasitism-enabled entry had nearly double the mortality than those with 
parasitism-resistant entry. Based on demographic multiple decrement life table 
analyses, mortality from each class was highly irreplaceable. Identifying and 
quantifying irreplaceable mortality classes and strategies to mitigate those 
causes may help producers decrease total population loss of M. rotundata before 
the adult stage.

Symptomatic multiple myeloma is commonly complicated by acute kidney injury 
through various mechanisms. The most frequent is the precipitation of monoclonal 
free light chains with uromodulin in the distal tubules, defining light chain 
cast nephropathy. Early diagnosis and identification of the cause of acute 
kidney injury are required for optimizing management and avoiding chronic kidney 
injury that strongly affects quality of life and patient survival. In light 
chain cast nephropathy, often manifesting with severe acute kidney injury, renal 
recovery requires urgent intervention based on vigorous rehydration, correction 
of precipitating factors, and efficient anti-plasma cell chemotherapy to rapidly 
reduce the secretion of nephrotoxic free light chains. Currently, the 
association of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone 
is the standard regimen in newly diagnosed patients. The addition of another 
drug such as cyclophosphamide or an immunodulatory agent may improve free light 
chain response but raises tolerance concerns in frail patients. Further studies 
are warranted to confirm the role of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, whose 
efficacy and tolerance have been documented in patients without renal 
impairment. Despite controversial results from randomized studies, recent data 
suggest that in patients with light chain cast nephropathy and acute kidney 
injury requiring dialysis, the combination of chemotherapy with free light chain 
removal through high-cutoff hemodialysis may increase renal response recovery 
rates. Kidney biopsy may be helpful in guiding management and assessing renal 
prognosis that appears to depend on the extent of cast formation and 
interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy. Because of continuous improvement in life 
expectancy of patients with multiple myeloma, renal transplantation is likely to 
be increasingly considered in selected candidates.

INTRODUCTION: In older patients, life expectancy is determined by a complex 
interaction of multiple geriatric domains. A comprehensive geriatric assessment 
(CGA) captures different geriatric domains. Yet, if and how components of the 
CGA are related to mortality in an outpatient geriatric setting is unknown. In 
the Amsterdam Ageing Cohort, we therefore studied distribution and accumulation 
of geriatric domain deficits in relation to mortality.
METHODS: All patients received a CGA as part of standard care, independent of 
referral reason. We summarized deficits on the CGA, using predefined cutoffs, in 
5 geriatric domains: somatic, mental, nutritional, physical, and social domain. 
Information on mortality was obtained from the Dutch municipal register. We used 
age- and sex-adjusted Cox proportional hazards analyses to relate the separate 
domains and accumulation of impaired domains to overall mortality.
RESULTS: From the 1,055 geriatric outpatients (53% female; age 79 ± 7 years), 
172 patients (16%) had died after 1.7 ± 1.1 years. In 626 patients (59%), 3 or 
more domains were impaired. All domains were independently associated with 
mortality, with the highest hazard for the somatic domain (HR 3.7 [1.7-8.0]) and 
the lowest hazard for the mental domain (HR 1.5 [1.1-12.0]). In addition, 
accumulation of impaired domains showed a gradually increased mortality risk, 
ranging from HR 2.2 (0.8-6.1) for 2 domains to HR 9.6 (3.7-24.7) for all 5 
domains impaired.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that impairment in multiple geriatric 
domains is highly prevalent and independently and cumulatively associated with 
mortality in an outpatient geriatric setting.

Successful Primary Medical Therapy with Somatostatin Receptor Ligand in 
Acromegaly with Thyroid Cancer.

Acromegaly is a rare disease with an annual incidence of 3 to 4 cases in a 
million.1 Diagnosis is often delayed due to the slow progression of the disease. 
Persistent elevation of growth hormone (GH) in acromegaly causes a reduction in 
life expectancy by 10 years. Aside from multiple cardiovascular, respiratory and 
metabolic co-morbidities, it has also been proven to cause an increased 
incidence of cancer. The main treatment of acromegaly is surgical excision of 
the functioning pituitary adenoma. Multiple comorbidities, including obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and soft tissue swelling, 
make surgery complicated, if not impossible. Medical therapy to reduce 
comorbidities may be indicated in certain situations. Somatostatin receptor 
ligands (SRL) are able to reduce, and possibly normalize, IGF-1 levels.2 
Reduction of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the main mediator of GH, is 
able to resolve headache, sweating, fatigue and soft tissue swelling, and also 
reduce ventricular hypertrophy. This case report illustrates the successful use 
of the SRL octreotide LAR in treating acromegaly. It also confirms the 
observation from several case series that thyroid cancer is the most common 
malignancy in acromegaly.

Cachexia is a metabolic mutiny that directly reduces life expectancy in chronic 
conditions such as cancer. The underlying mechanisms associated with cachexia 
involve inflammation, metabolism, and anorexia. Therefore, the need to identify 
cachexia biomarkers is warranted to better understand catabolism change and 
assess various therapeutic interventions. Among inflammatory proteins, growth 
differentiation factor-15 (GDF15), an atypical transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-β) superfamily member, emerges as a stress-related hormone. In inflammatory 
conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, GDF15 is a biomarker for 
disease outcome. GDF15 is also implicated in energy homeostasis, body weight 
regulation, and plays a distinct role in cachexia. The recent discovery of its 
receptor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor 
α-like (GFRAL), sheds light on its metabolic function. Herein, we critically 
review the mechanisms involving GDF15 in cancer cachexia and discuss therapeutic 
interventions to improve outcomes in people living with cancer.

USA.

OBJECTIVES: Socioeconomic disparities in life expectancy in the United States 
(US) are marked and have widened over time. However, there is limited research 
using individual-level socioeconomic variables as such information is generally 
lacking or unreliable in vital records used for life table construction. Using 
longitudinal cohort data, we computed life expectancy for US adults by social 
determinants such as education, income/poverty level, occupation, and housing 
tenure.
METHODS: We analyzed the 1997-2014 National Health Interview Survey 
prospectively linked to mortality records in the National Death Index 
(N=1,146,271). Standard life table methodologies were used to compute life 
expectancy and other life table functions at various ages according to 
socioeconomic variables stratified by sex and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Adults with at least a Master's degree had 14.7 years higher life 
expectancy at age 18 than those with less than a high school education and 8.3 
years higher life expectancy than those with a high school education. Poverty 
was inversely related to life expectancy. Individuals living in poverty had 10.5 
years lower life expectancy at age 18 than those with incomes ≥400% of the 
poverty threshold. Laborers and those employed in craft and repair occupations 
had, respectively, 10.9 years and 8.6 years lower life expectancy at age 18 than 
those with professional and managerial occupations. Male and female renters had, 
respectively, 4.0 years and 4.6 years lower life expectancy at age 18 than 
homeowners. Women in the most advantaged socioeconomic group outlived men in the 
most disadvantaged group by 23.5 years at age 18.
CONCLUSIONS AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Marked socioeconomic gradients in US 
life expectancy were found across all sex and racial/ethnic groups. Adults with 
lower education, higher poverty levels, in manual occupations, and with rental 
housing had substantially lower life expectancy compared to their counterparts 
with higher socioeconomic position.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the quadriceps V-Y turndown 
augmentation for acute quadriceps tendon ruptures in the setting of TKA.
METHODS: Prospective cohort of 22 patients with quadriceps rupture after TKA 
were compared with 44 matched patients underwent TKA without quadriceps rupture. 
Quadriceps ruptures were treated within three weeks after injury by suture 
augmented with Scuderi quadriceps V-Y turndown flap. Clinical evaluation was 
performed by the Knee Society Scores (KSS), Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and range of motion. Patellar height 
was assessed by the Blackburne-Peel ratio.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 3.3 (range, 3-4) years. At the final follow-up, 
there were significant improvements in mean KSS scores in both groups 
(p = 0.001). In the quadriceps group, the mean flexion for all patients, but one 
with arthrodesis for periprosthetic infection, was 100.1° (range, 90-110°) and 
mean extensor lag was 7.1° (range, 0-20°). There were significant differences 
between groups in KSS scores (p = 0.001). Active flexion (p = 0.020) and 
extension (p = 0.001) were significantly better in the control group. However, 
there was no significant difference in WOMAC scores (p = 0.252) or patient 
satisfaction (p = 0.352). There were no quadriceps reruptures. One patient with 
periprosthetic infection was treated with arthrodesis.
CONCLUSION: The quadriceps V-Y turndown is an effective and safe procedure for 
quadriceps ruptures in the setting of TKA. Although the functional outcomes were 
lower than in TKA patients with no quadriceps rupture, the quality of life and 
satisfaction were successful in the TKA patients with quadriceps rupture.

Background The unpredictable trajectory of pediatric advanced heart disease 
makes prognostication difficult for physicians and informed decision-making 
challenging for families. This study evaluated parent and physician 
understanding of disease burden and prognosis in hospitalized children with 
advanced heart disease. Methods and Results A longitudinal survey study of 
parents and physicians caring for patients with advanced heart disease age 
30 days to 19 years admitted for ≥7 days was performed over a 1-year period 
(n=160 pairs). Percentage agreement and weighted kappa statistics were used to 
assess agreement. Median patient age was 1 year (interquartile range, 1-5), 39% 
had single-ventricle lesions, and 37% were in the cardiac intensive care unit. 
Although 92% of parents reported understanding their child's prognosis 
"extremely well" or "well," 28% of physicians thought parents understood the 
prognosis only "a little," "somewhat," or "not at all." Better parent-reported 
prognostic understanding was associated with greater preparedness for their 
child's medical problems (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.4-21.7, P=0.02). There was 
poor parent-physician agreement in assessing functional class, symptom burden, 
and likelihood of limitations in physical activity and learning/behavior; on 
average, parents were more optimistic. Many parents (47%) but few physicians 
(6%) expected the child to have normal life expectancy. Conclusions Parents and 
physicians caring for children with advanced heart disease differed in their 
perspectives regarding prognosis and disease burden. Physicians tended to 
underestimate the degree of parent-reported symptom burden. Parents were less 
likely to expect limitations in physical activity, learning/behavior, and life 
expectancy. Combined interventions involving patient-reported outcomes, parent 
education, and physician communication tools may be beneficial.

The detection of telomerase is of great significance for monitoring cell 
canceration. The conventional methods depend on the extension of telomerase 
towards its primer to conduct signal transduction. Herein, a specific and 
reliable detection strategy based on stepwise recognition was developed for 
tandem detection of metal ions and enzymes. We first synthesized an electrically 
active metal-organic framework (MIL-101(Fe)), which can act directly as a signal 
reporter in phosphate buffered saline after being modified with capture DNA 
(cDNA). When the zinc ion is added as a coenzyme factor, the modified hairpin 
DNA on the electrode is cleaved by DNAzyme to yield the activated primer. After 
the addition of telomerase, the cleaved DNA strand would be extended, and the 
resulting sequence will be hybridized with the signal label of MIL-101(Fe)-cDNA. 
Therefore, a signal-on strategy for the detection of telomerase was achieved 
based on the direct electrochemical analysis of MIL-101(Fe). Moreover, this 
electrochemical biosensor can discriminate telomerase activity among different 
cell lines. The stepwise recognition ensured the advantages of an 
electrochemical biosensor such as high sensitivity and specificity during the 
detection process, providing a novel method for monitoring and diagnosis of 
diseases.

The use of buffered soluble alendronate 70 mg effervescent tablet, a convenient 
dosing regimen for bisphosphonate therapy, seems a cost-effective strategy 
compared with relevant alternative treatments for postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis aged 60 years and over in Italy.
INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of buffered soluble alendronate 
(ALN) 70 mg effervescent tablet compared with relevant alternative treatments 
for postmenopausal osteoporotic women in Italy.
METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adjusted to the 
Italian healthcare setting to estimate the lifetime costs (expressed in €2019) 
per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of buffered soluble ALN compared with 
generic ALN, denosumab, zoledronic acid and no treatment. Pooled efficacy data 
derived from the NICE network meta-analysis were used for bisphosphonate 
treatments. Two treatment duration scenarios were assessed: 1 year using 
persistence data derived from an Italian prospective observational study 
including 144 and 216 postmenopausal osteoporotic women on buffered soluble ALN 
and oral ALN, respectively, and 3 years. Analyses were conducted for women 60-80 
years of age with a bone mineral density T-score ≤ - 3.0 or with existing 
vertebral fractures.
RESULTS: In all simulated populations, buffered soluble ALN was dominant (more 
QALYs, lower costs) compared to denosumab. The cost per QALY gained of buffered 
soluble ALN compared to generic ALN and no treatment always falls below €20,000 
per QALY gained. In the 1-year treatment scenario, zoledronic acid was 
associated with more QALY than buffered soluble ALN but the cost per QALY gained 
of zoledronic acid compared with buffered soluble ALN was always higher than 
€70,000, while buffered soluble ALN was dominant in the 3-year treatment 
scenario.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that buffered soluble ALN represents a 
cost-effective strategy compared with relevant alternative treatments for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis women in Italy aged 60 years and over.

diminishing population health and worsening health disparities. We developed 
Project ACTIVE, a program to improve adherence with preventive care goals 
through personalized and patient-centered care.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Project ACTIVE improved utilization of 
preventive care and/or estimated life expectancy compared to usual care.
DESIGN: Single-site randomized controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Cluster-randomized 140 English or Spanish speaking adult patients 
in primary care with at least one of twelve unfulfilled preventive care goals 
based on USPSTF grade A and B recommendations.
INTERVENTION: Project ACTIVE employs a validated mathematical model to predict 
and rank individualized estimates of health benefit that would arise from 
improved adherence to different preventive care guidelines. Clinical staff 
engaged the participant in a shared medical decision-making (SMD) process to 
identify highest priority unfulfilled clinical goals, and health coaching staff 
engaged the participant to develop and monitor action steps to reach those 
goals.
MAIN MEASURES: Change in number of unfulfilled preventive care goals from USPSTF 
grade A and B recommendations and change in overall gain in estimated life 
expectancy.
KEY RESULTS: In an intent-to-treat analysis, Project ACTIVE increased the 
average number of fulfilled preventive care goals out of 12 by 0.68 in the 
intervention arm compared with 0.15 in the control arm (mean difference [95% CI] 
0.53 [0.19-0.86]), yielding a gain in estimated life expectancy of 8.8 months 
(3.8, 14.2). In a per-protocol analysis, Project ACTIVE increased fulfilled 
preventive care goals by 0.80 in the intervention arm compared with 0.16 in the 
control arm (mean difference [95% CI], 0.65 [0.25-1.04]), yielding a gain in 
estimated life expectancy of 13.7 months (6.2, 21.2). Among the 12 preventive 
care goals, more improvement occurred for alcohol use, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, depression, and smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Project ACTIVE improved unfulfilled preventive care goals and 
improved estimated life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The introduction of stem cell transplantation has improved life 
expectancy and cognitive outcome in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I, but 
this condition remains associated with substantial residual disease in several 
parts of the body. Many patients have hip dysplasia with progressive medial 
flattening of the femoral head. Quantitative evidence on the effect of surgery 
on remodeling to sphericity of flattened femoral heads is lacking. In the 
present study, we used statistical shape modeling to quantify the effect of hip 
surgery on the sphericity of the femoral head in patients with 
mucopolysaccharidosis I.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective case control study involving a series of 
23 patients with hip dysplasia due to mucopolysaccharidosis I. Surgery was not 
offered to the first 11 children (control group). Following a change in 
treatment protocol, the next 12 children underwent bilateral proximal femoral 
varus derotation osteotomy and Pemberton osteotomy for the treatment of 
acetabular dysplasia with progressive femoral head flattening (surgery group). 
The surgery and control groups were compared with a reference group of patients 
with normal hips. Statistical shape modeling was used to quantify the shape of 
the femoral head (i.e., flattening and/or roundness of the epiphysis).
RESULTS: The mean age at the time of stem cell transplantation in the surgery 
and control groups was comparable (1.2 years). The mean age at the time of 
surgical intervention was 5.5 years, and mean duration of postoperative 
follow-up was 3.3 years. Statistical shape modeling showed variations within the 
total group in terms of medial indentation, width, height, and sphericity of the 
femoral heads. In contrast to the progressive femoral head flattening in the 
control group, the surgery group showed improvement of the sphericity of the 
femoral head after surgery. The overall shape characteristics of the femoral 
head in the surgery group were similar to those of the reference group of 
patients with normal hips.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study in patients with 
mucopolysaccharidosis I that has shown quantitative remodeling of the 
dysplastic, flattened femoral head to normal sphericity after increasing 
containment of the femoral head.

The Case for Biocalculus: Improving Student Understanding of the Utility Value 
of Mathematics to Biology and Affect toward Mathematics.

The next generation of life science professionals will require far more 
quantitative skills than prior generations. Calculus is important for 
understanding dynamical systems in biology and, therefore, is often a required 
course for life science students. However, many life science students do not 
understand the utility value of mathematics to biology. Therefore, according to 
expectancy-value theory, life science students may experience lower motivation, 
which can impact their performance in a calculus course. This study examines how 
two different biocalculus courses, which integrated calculus and biological 
concepts and successfully halved the rates of students earning a D, F, or 
withdrawing (DFW), affected life science students' utility value, interest, and 
overall attitudes toward mathematics. Using pre and post surveys, we found that 
students' interest in mathematics increased by the end of the semester, and they 
demonstrated a more sophisticated understanding of how mathematics is used in 
biology. Students whose attitudes toward mathematics improved primarily 
attributed these changes to a better understanding of the utility of mathematics 
to biology, feelings of competence in mathematics, or rapport with the 
instructor. Thus, communicating the utility value of mathematics to biology 
through integrated mathematics-biology courses can contribute to improved 
attitudes toward mathematics that can impact students' motivation and 
performance.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of smoking in the working-age Indonesian 
population in terms of costs, years of life, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost.
METHODS: Life table modelling of Indonesian smokers aged 15-54 years, followed 
up until 55 years (retirement age). Contemporary data on demographics, all-cause 
mortality, population attributable fractions and prevalence of smoking were 
derived from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The quality of 
life and reduction in productivity due to smoking were derived from published 
sources. The analysis was repeated but with the assumption that the cohorts were 
non-smokers. The differences in results represented the losses incurred due to 
smoking. Gross domestic product (GDP) per equivalent full-time worker (US$11 
765) was used for estimation of the cost of each PALY, and an annual discount 
rate of 3.0% was applied to all costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: The prevalences of smoking among Indonesian working-age men and women 
were 67.2% and 2.16%, respectively. This study estimated that smoking caused 
846 123 excess deaths, 2.9 million years of life lost (0.40%), 41.6 million 
QALYs lost (5.9%) and 15.6 million PALYs lost (2.3%). The total cost of 
productivity loss due to smoking amounted to US$183.7 billion among the 
working-age population followed up until retirement. Healthcare cost was 
predicted to be US$1.8 trillion. Over a 1-year time horizon, US$10.2 billion was 
lost in GDP and 117 billion was lost in healthcare costs.
CONCLUSION: Smoking imposes significant health and economic burden in Indonesia. 
The findings stress the importance of developing effective tobacco control 
strategies at the macro and micro levels, which would benefit the country both 
in terms of health and wealth.

BACKGROUND: Critical limb ischaemia is a severe stage of lower limb peripheral 
artery disease which can lead to tissue loss, gangrene, amputation and death. 
FlowOx™ therapy is a novel negative-pressure chamber system intended for home 
use to increase blood flow, reduce pain and improve wound healing for patients 
with peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischaemia.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to assess the relative 
cost-effectiveness of FlowOx™ therapy compared to standard care in lower limb 
peripheral artery disease patients with intermittent claudication or critical 
limb ischaemia. The model used data from two European trials of FlowOx™ therapy 
and published evidence on disease progression. From an NHS analysis perspective, 
various FlowOx™ therapy scenarios were modelled by adjusting the dose of FlowOx™ 
therapy and the amount of other care received alongside FlowOx™ therapy, in 
comparison to standard care.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, consisting of FlowOx™ therapy plus nominal 
care, the cost estimates were £12,704 for a single dose of FlowOx™ therapy per 
annum as compared with £15,523 for standard care. FlowOx™ therapy patients 
gained 0.27 additional quality adjusted life years compared to standard care 
patients. This equated to a dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per 
QALY gained. At the NICE threshold WTP of £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained, 
FlowOx™ therapy in addition to standard care had a 0.80 and 1.00 probability of 
being cost-effectiveness respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: FlowOx™ therapy delivered as a single annual dose may be a 
cost-effective treatment for peripheral artery disease. FlowOx™ therapy improved 
health outcomes and reduced treatment costs in this modelled cohort. The 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FlowOx™ therapy is susceptible to 
disease severity, adherence, dose and treatment cost. Research assessing the 
impact of FlowOx™ therapy on NHS resource use is needed in order to provide a 
definitive economic evaluation.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a rare 
pancreatic disorder that usually affects young women with no or nonspecific 
clinical manifestation. It accounts for approximately 1% of pancreatic 
neoplasms. The incidence of SPN is increasing, owing to improved imaging 
techniques and better recognition of this entity. Although most patients with 
SPNs have a favorable prognosis after radical resection, local recurrence or 
metastasis still occurs after surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 15-year-old female with a small solid 
pseudopapillary neoplasm in the Pancreas' proximal body. The patient presented 
with nonspecific symptoms and was diagnosed incidentally.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The patient underwent a central pancreatectomy and was 
discharged on the fifth postoperative day without complications. Central 
pancreatectomy may prevent devastating complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy 
surgery.
CONCLUSION: As SPN is a rare entity of pancreatic tumors, the surgical options 
for management are still debated. The respect for surgery should account for the 
tumor site and size. Also, life expectancy and surgical complications for each 
choice should be considered. In localized disease, segmental resection may 
prevent devastating complications of radical resection.

Community organizing with government support, termed local self-governance 
(LSG), is a form of policy decentralization for community wellbeing through 
solutions tailored to local issues. One form of LSG is multifunctional autonomy, 
in which citizens can comprehensively manage their communities with government 
support. This study clarified the effect of multifunctional autonomy on healthy 
life expectancy by assessing related advantages and challenges in rural Japanese 
communities, using a mixed-methods approach. Disability-free life expectancy 
from 65 years (DFLE-65) was assessed to compare healthy life expectancies 
between two rural Japanese cities (with/without multifunctional autonomy). 
Comparisons revealed better DFLE-65 only among older men in a city with 
multifunctional autonomy. A cost-effectiveness analysis investigated the 
relationship between the budget and DFLE-65 change using questionnaire data. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis of multifunctional autonomy indicated 61,147 
yen/DFLE-65. Thematic analysis revealed that multifunctional autonomy created 
new roles for older men, improving community relationships. However, sustainable 
multifunctional autonomy in LSG communities may be hindered by a generally aging 
society, generation gap, and lack of mutual understanding between rural 
communities and local governments. To ensure the sustainability of 
multifunctional autonomy, collaborations between local communities and 
governments and among various generations are critical.

BACKGROUND: Effective treatment has extended the life expectancy and reduced 
disability in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, previous research has 
found 45-65% of working-age PLWH were unemployed compared to 5-10% in the 
general public of North America and Europe. We examined the barriers to gaining 
employment among PLWH.
METHODS: Thirty-five in-depth interviews were conducted in person or over the 
phone with PLWH living in Toronto or Ottawa. This included PLWH who were 
unemployed but actively seeking employment, as well as PLWH who had successfully 
gained employment through an agency that specifically supported PLWH funded by 
the AIDS Committee of Toronto. Interviews were conducted between February 2019 
and March 2020. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed 
using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The majority of participants were between the ages of 40-55 and 
identified as male. Participants shared many common barriers when describing 
their attempts to attain or maintain employment. Although varying in employment 
status at the time of the study, consistent barriers included experiencing HIV 
stigma in workplaces, challenges overcoming mental health illnesses, and 
difficulties in navigating social assistance and unemployment insurance programs 
when pursuing a return to work.
CONCLUSIONS: PLWH face significant barriers when attempting to engage with 
employment opportunities. Health providers and organizations can do more to 
support campaigns to end HIV stigma, to support individuals in pursuing 
employment, and to advocate for policy change that supports reentry into the 
workforce for PLHA.

Update of
    medRxiv. 2020 Oct 15;:

COVID-19 has resulted in a staggering death toll in the United States: over 
215,000 by mid-October 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Black and Latino Americans have experienced a disproportionate 
burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural 
inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for 
those infected. We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 y for 2020, 
for the total US population and by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of 
deaths-one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including 
COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation. Our medium estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at 
birth of 1.13 y to 77.48 y, lower than any year since 2003. We also project a 
0.87-y reduction in life expectancy at age 65 y. The Black and Latino 
populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 
2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y 
reduction for Whites. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the 
Black-White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating 
progress made in reducing this differential since 2006. Latinos, who have 
consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites (a phenomenon known as the 
Latino or Hispanic paradox), would see their more than 3-y survival advantage 
reduced to less than 1 y.
