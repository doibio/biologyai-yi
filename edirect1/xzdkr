Significance: Both incidence and mortality rates of sepsis significantly 
increase with advanced age, and the majority of sepsis patients are late 
middle-aged or older. With the proportion of older adults rapidly increasing in 
developed countries, age-dependent sepsis vulnerability is an urgent medical 
issue. Due to an increasing life expectancy, postsepsis complications and health 
care costs are expected to increase as well. Recent Advances: Older patients 
suffer from higher sepsis incidence and mortality rates, likely resulting from 
frequent comorbidities, increased coagulation, dysgylcemia, and altered immune 
responses. Critical Issues: Despite a large number of ongoing clinical and basic 
research studies, there is currently no effective therapeutic strategy targeting 
older patients with severe sepsis. The disparity between clinical and basic 
studies is a problem, and this is largely due to the use of animal models 
lacking clinical relevance. Although the majority of sepsis cases occur in older 
adults, most laboratory animals used for sepsis research are very young. 
Further, despite the wide use of combination fluid and antibiotic treatment in 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients, most animal research does not include such 
treatment. Future Directions: Because sepsis is a systemic disease with multiple 
organ dysfunction, combined therapy approaches, not those targeting single 
pathways or single organs, are essential. As for preclinical research, it is 
critical to confirm new findings using aged animal models with clinically 
relevant ICU-like medical treatments. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 35, 1358-1375.

OBJECTIVE: Management and outcomes of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) are 
highly variable and not well described. Therefore, the INvestigating SIGnificant 
Health TrendS in the management of SVT (INSIGHTS-SVT) study collected 
prospective data under real life conditions.
METHODS: Prospective observational study of objectively confirmed acute isolated 
SVT. The primary outcome was a composite of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and extension or recurrence of SVT at three 
months. The primary safety outcome was clinically relevant bleeding.
RESULTS: A total of 1 150 patients were included (mean age 60.2 ± 14.7 years; 
64.9% women; mean BMI 29.4 ± 6.3 kg/m2). SVT was below the knee in 54.5%, above 
the knee in 26.7%, above and below the knee in 18.8%. At baseline, 93.6% 
received pharmacological treatment (65.7% fondaparinux, 23.2% heparins, 4.3% 
direct oral anticoagulants [DOACs], 14.5% analgesics), 77.0% compression 
treatment, and 1.9% surgery; 6.4% did not receive any anticoagulation. The 
primary outcome occurred in 5.8%; 4.7% had recurrent or extended SVT, 1.7% DVT, 
and 0.8% PE. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 1.2% and major 
bleeding in 0.3%. Complete clinical recovery of SVT was reported in 708 patients 
(62.4%). Primary outcome adjusted by propensity score and for treatment duration 
was lower with fondaparinux compared with low molecular weight heparin (4.4% vs. 
9.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3 - 0.9; p = .017). 
On multivariable analysis, associated factors for primary outcome included 
another SVT prior to the present SVT event (HR 2.3), age per year (HR 0.97), 
duration of drug treatment per week (HR 0.92), and thrombus length (HR 1.03).
CONCLUSION: At three month follow up, patients with isolated SVT are at risk of 
thromboembolic complications (mainly recurrent or extended SVT), despite 
anticoagulation. In this real life study, about one third had received either 
heparins, oral anticoagulants, or no anticoagulation.

OBJECTIVES: This study analyses the cost-effectiveness of annual low-dose CT 
(LDCT) screening of high-risk cancer populations in Chinese urban areas.
DESIGN: We used a Markov model to evaluate LDCT screening from a sociological 
perspective.
SETTING: The data from two large lung cancer screening programmes in China were 
used.
PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 100 000 smokers who underwent annual LDCT 
screening until age 76.
INTERVENTION: The study comprises five screening strategies, with the initial 
screening ages in both the screening strategies and their corresponding 
non-screening strategies being 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 years, respectively.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) between screening and non-screening strategies at the same initial age 
was evaluated.
RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, compared with those who were not screened, 
the specific mortality from lung cancer decreased by 18.52%-23.13% among those 
who underwent screening. The ICER of LDCT screening ranges from US$13 056.82 to 
US$15 736.06 per quality-adjusted life year, which is greater than one but less 
than three times the gross domestic product per capita in China. An initial 
screening age of 55 years is the most cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline analysis shows that annual LDCT screening of heavy smokers 
in Chinese urban areas is likely to be cost-effective. The sensitivity analysis 
reveals that sensitivity, specificity and the overdiagnosis rate influence the 
cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening. All scenarios tested demonstrate 
cost-effectiveness, except for the combination of worst values of sensitivity, 
specificity and overdiagnosis. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of a screening 
strategy depends on the performance of LDCT screenings.

PURPOSE: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma involving the brain with possible leptomeningeal and ocular 
involvement. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified 
intravitreal injection regimen of methotrexate (MTX) for therapeutic management 
of vitreoretinal lymphoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Chinese 
patients with primary vitreoretinal lymphoma were included in this retrospective 
noncomparative interventional case series study. Patients were treated with a 
modified protocol of intravitreal injection of MTX (400 µg/0.1 ml) according to 
the Intensive-Consolidation-Maintenance regimen. The Intensive phase of 
once-weekly intravitreal injections for 1 month, followed by the Consolidation 
phase of one injection every 2 weeks for 1 month, and then the Maintenance phase 
of once monthly for 1 month, for a total of 7 injections. The primary main 
outcome measures were clinical response to intravitreal chemotherapy, number of 
injections for clinical remission, progression-free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS), visual acuity (VA), complications during the study period, and 
cause of death were investigated.
RESULTS: The duration of follow-up from the commencement of injection of MTX was 
12-73 months (median 28, 30.55 ± 14.73 months). A total of 61 eyes of 40 
patients were cleared clinically from malignant cells after a median 6.57 ± 3.12 
(median 6, range 1-14) times of injection of MTX. A second remission was induced 
in 3 patients, who were treated with a further course of intravitreal 
chemotherapy after tumour recurred in their eyes. The median PFS and OS were 
20.82 months (95% CI 14.64-27.01) and 29.29 months (95% CI 16.16-42.41), 
respectively. Complications that occurred during the period of treatment and 
follow-up included corneal epitheliopathy (3 of 61 eyes) and cataract (6 of 61 
eyes). There were no cases of maculopathy, vitreous haemorrhage, optic atrophy, 
and sterile endophthalmitis. No patient had an irreversible loss of vision that 
could be attributed to the intravitreal injection of MTX.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that the modified intravitreal injection 
regimen of MTX is an effective therapeutic approach in inducing clinical 
remission of intraocular involvement in PCNSL patients, associated with few 
complications. However, further study needs to be conducted to indicate whether 
the proposed approach extends life expectancy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) can involve the 
vitreous and retina and is associated with a poor clinical outcome, with a 
survival rate of less than 3 months in absence of undergoing an effective 
therapeutic strategy. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most efficient cytotoxic drug 
for patients with vitreoretinal involvement in primary vitreoretinal lymphoma 
(PVRL), through intravitreal injection of MTX. In our experience, the modified 
protocol of intravitreal MTX according to the 
Intensive-Consolidation-Maintenance regimen, was effective in inducing clinical 
remission of PVRL with few complications. The accumulating clinical results 
brought us to propose the consideration of this protocol as a good first-line 
treatment option for PVRL.

BACKGROUND: As Japan's population continues to age, it is estimated that the 
number of people aged ≥75 years will exceed 20 million by 2025. Furthermore, 
over the past 10 years, we have not reduced the difference between life 
expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Therefore, the extension of healthy life 
expectancy and the development of a healthy society are the most urgent issues. 
In terms of medical care, the changing times have inevitably led to changes in 
disease structures and medical demands; therefore, the medical delivery system 
has had to be changed to meet these demands. As dementia rapidly increases, it 
is important to address "frailty," a condition in which people become more 
vulnerable to environmental factors as they age, and there is a need to provide 
services to older people, particularly the old-old, that emphasize quality of 
life in addition to medical care. To realize a super-aged society that will 
remain vigorous and vibrant for many years, we need to rethink the future of 
Japanese medicine and healthcare, and the state of society.
CURRENT SITUATION AND PROBLEMS: Disparity between healthy life expectancy and 
average life expectancy in the realization of a healthy society It is a 
challenge to build a society with a long and healthy life expectancy through 
comprehensive prevention and management of lifestyle-related diseases, as well 
as the elucidation of the factors that explain sex differences in healthy life 
expectancy, based on the recognition that lifestyle-related diseases in midlife 
are risk factors for frailty and dementia in old age. Challenges in medical care 
for building a super-aged and healthy society The challenges include promoting 
clinical guidelines suitable for older people, including lifestyle-related 
disease management, promoting comprehensive research on aging (basic research, 
clinical research and community collaboration research), and embodying a 
paradigm shift from "cure-seeking medical care" to "cure- and support-seeking 
medical care." Furthermore, the key to the future of integrated community care 
is the development of a comprehensive medical care system for older people in 
each region and the development of the next generation of medical personnel. 
Dissemination of frailty prevention measures in a super-aged society The concept 
of frailty encompasses the meaning of multifacetedness and reversibility; 
therefore, a comprehensive approach is required, including the renewal of 
conventional prevention activities in each region, such as the nutritional 
status of older people, physical activity including exercise, and various 
opportunities for social participation and participation conditions. Challenges 
of an unstable diet and undernutrition in older people According to the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of Japan, energy and protein intakes are 
low in Japanese people aged ≥75 years; particularly in people aged ≥80 years, 
low and insufficient intake of nutrients are prominent. Undernutrition in older 
people is increasing and is more pronounced in women. There are multiple factors 
behind this, including social factors, such as living alone, eating alone, 
poverty and other social factors, as well as problems with access to food 
security. Pharmacotherapy for older people: measures against polypharmacy In 
addition to the problems of adverse drug events, drug interactions, duplication 
of effects and the presence of drugs that "require particularly careful 
administration," it is also necessary to take measures against polypharmacy in 
older people, as well as medical economic issues, such as high drug costs and 
large amounts of remaining drugs. Barriers to this measure include multiple 
medical institution visits for each disease, lack of coordination between 
professions, and lack of understanding by patients and families. Role of local 
communities in a healthy society The decline in the working-age population is 
also a major challenge; however, we need to make a shift to use this declining 
birthrate and aging population as an opportunity rather than a crisis. As we 
look ahead to the coming of the 100-year age of life, we rethink the creation of 
a comprehensive society and community, and aim to create an age-free society 
where everyone can play an active role and live in peace, regardless of age.
CONTENTS OF THE PROPOSAL: In this report, we have put together a vision for the 
future of an aging Japanese society from a broader perspective of how the 
environment and local communities should be, rather than simply from the 
perspective of individual health. We aim to convey this proposal to the Ministry 
of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, 
Science and Technology, the Cabinet Office, and various professional 
organizations. The paradigm shift from "cure-seeking medical care" to "cure- and 
support-seeking medical care" should be promoted for the development of a 
healthy society While further promoting pre-emptive medical care in the medical 
care for older people, the development of multidisciplinary medical guidelines 
appropriate for older people should be promoted at the same time. In addition, 
we should promote basic aging research, clinical research (including the 
long-term care field) and transitional research that cover regional areas. 
Furthermore, while promoting the paradigm shift from "cure-seeking medical care" 
to "cure- and support-seeking medical care," the development of various 
comprehensive medical treatment systems for older people and the strengthening 
of integrated community care systems should be promoted. Development of the next 
generation of medical personnel to comprehensively deal with geriatric care, 
including training geriatric specialists, should be promoted As the number of 
older people with multimorbidities and frailty rapidly increases in the future, 
we should promote the development of the next generation of medical personnel 
who can comprehensively handle medical care for older people, including training 
leading geriatricians in cooperation with multiple professions in the integrated 
community care system to provide sufficient medical care. Countermeasures for 
frailty in older people should be promoted from medical and community planning 
perspectives To address frailty, which requires comprehensive evaluation and 
intervention, the three pillars of frailty prevention (nutrition, exercise and 
social participation) should be incorporated and addressed as part of community 
development within each municipality, taking into account local characteristics. 
In particular, it is necessary to revise the way of thinking about nutrition 
management in older people and the guidelines of the societies in the field. In 
addition, it is important to strengthen industry-academia-government-private 
partnerships in each region, taking into account not only medical issues, but 
also social factors, and encourage the development of momentum in the entire 
region regarding measures against undernutrition in older people. Polypharmacy 
measures should be promoted in pharmacotherapy for older people It is necessary 
to promote cooperation between physicians and pharmacists, establish other 
multiprofessional cooperation systems, and develop medical and long-term care 
insurance systems to support this. It is also essential to change the public's 
mindset, and awareness-raising activities at all levels are required, including 
the enhancement of educational materials for medical caregivers and the general 
public. In addition, the economic impact of healthcare using big data should be 
timely clarified. Innovation in medical and urban planning perspectives should 
be promoted In the future, it will be necessary to modify and update 
multidisciplinary approaches such as social participation (e.g. participation in 
a salon) with a view to innovation in both medical care and community 
development, especially on the idea of a symbiotic community. In addition, 
industry-academia-government-private partnership is necessary, including all 
aforementioned, such as places where people can play an active role in the rest 
of their lives (such as employment), promotion of human connections, promotion 
of technology to support older people and support for daily life. Geriatr

BACKGROUND: Yoga is a meditative movement therapy focused on mind-body 
awareness. The impact of yoga on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes 
in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized wait-list controlled trial of 8 weeks 
of yoga (n = 21) versus wait-list control (n = 20) for CIPN in 41 breast and 
gynecological cancer survivors with persistent moderate to severe CIPN. HRQOL 
endpoints were Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief Fatigue 
Inventory (BFI), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The Treatment Expectancy 
Scale (TES) was administered at baseline. We estimated mean changes and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) from baseline to weeks 8 and 12 and compared arms 
using constrained linear mixed models.
RESULTS: At week 8, HADS anxiety scores decreased -1.61 (-2.75, -0.46) in the 
yoga arm and -0.32 (-1.38, 0.75) points in the wait-list control arm 
(p = 0.099). At week 12, HADS anxiety scores decreased -1.42 (-2.57, -0.28) in 
yoga compared to an increase of 0.46 (-0.60, 1.53) in wait-list control 
(p = 0.017). There were no significant differences in HADS depression, BFI, or 
ISI scores between yoga and wait-list control. Baseline TES was significantly 
higher in yoga than in wait-list control (14.9 vs. 12.7, p = 0.019). TES was not 
associated with HADS anxiety reduction and HADS anxiety reduction was not 
associated with CIPN pain reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Yoga may reduce anxiety in patients with CIPN. Future studies are 
needed to confirm these findings.

Recent estimates have reiterated that non-fatal causes of disease, such as low 
back pain, headaches and depressive disorders, are amongst the leading causes of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). For these causes, the contribution of 
years lived with disability (YLD) - put simply, ill-health - is what drives 
DALYs, not mortality. Being able to monitor trends in YLD closely is 
particularly relevant for countries that sit high on the socio-demographic 
spectrum of development, as it contributes more than half of all DALYs. There is 
a paucity of data on how the population-level occurrence of disease is 
distributed according to severity, and as such, the majority of global and 
national efforts in monitoring YLD lack the ability to differentiate changes in 
severity across time and location. This raises uncertainties in interpreting 
these findings without triangulation with other relevant data sources. Our 
commentary aims to bring this issue to the forefront for users of burden of 
disease estimates, as its impact is often easily overlooked as part of the 
fundamental process of generating DALY estimates. Moreover, the wider health 
harms of the COVID-19 pandemic have underlined the likelihood of latent and 
delayed demand in accessing vital health and care services that will ultimately 
lead to exacerbated disease severity and health outcomes. This places increased 
importance on attempts to be able to differentiate by both the occurrence and 
severity of disease.

Cystic fibrosis is the most prevalent inherited disease caused by a defect in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The 
impaired electrolyte homeostasis caused by the mutated or absent protein leads 
to symptoms in multiple organ systems. However, the pulmonary manifestation with 
chronic infections and eventually respiratory failure remains the most important 
threat. Until one decade ago, only symptomatic treatment was available. However, 
since 2012, different combinations of CFTR modulators are available for people 
with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) that carry different mutations. The advent of these 
drugs has impressively changed life expectancy and quality of life in people 
with cystic fibrosis and raised new challenges regarding long-term complications 
and tapering of conventional therapies.Conclusion: In this review, we provide an 
update on the latest developments around diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis 
of pwCF. What is Known: • Cystic fibrosis is an incurable and life-shortening 
disease asking for life-long symptomatic treatment. • Three combination CFTR 
modulating drugs has gained marked approval over the last 10 years. What is New: 
• The emerge of new (modulating) therapies contribute to the increasing life 
expectancy. • A high unmet need to develop new therapies for people with CF who 
cannot access or benefit from these drugs remains. This review gives an update 
on the current status.

BACKGROUND: Multiple health behaviour change (MHBC) interventions that promote 
healthy lifestyles may be an efficient approach in the prevention or treatment 
of chronic diseases in primary care. This study aims to evaluate the 
cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of the health promotion EIRA intervention in 
terms of MHBC and cardiovascular reduction.
METHODS: An economic evaluation alongside a 12-month cluster-randomised (1:1) 
controlled trial conducted between 2017 and 2018 in 25 primary healthcare 
centres from seven Spanish regions. The study took societal and healthcare 
provider perspectives. Patients included were between 45 and 75 years old and 
had any two of these three behaviours: smoking, insufficient physical activity 
or low adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern. Intervention duration was 
12 months and combined three action levels (individual, group and community). 
MHBC, defined as a change in at least two health risk behaviours, and 
cardiovascular risk (expressed in % points) were the outcomes used to calculate 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were estimated and used to calculate incremental cost-utility ratios 
(ICUR). Missing data was imputed and bootstrapping with 1000 replications was 
used to handle uncertainty in the modelling results.
RESULTS: The study included 3062 participants. Intervention costs were €295 
higher than usual care costs. Five per-cent additional patients in the 
intervention group did a MHBC compared to usual care patients. Differences in 
QALYS or cardiovascular risk between-group were close to 0 (- 0.01 and 0.04 
respectively). The ICER was €5598 per extra health behaviour change in one 
patient and €6926 per one-point reduction in cardiovascular risk from a societal 
perspective. The cost-utility analysis showed that the intervention increased 
costs and has no effect, in terms of QALYs, compared to usual care from a 
societal perspective. Cost-utility planes showed high uncertainty surrounding 
the ICUR. Sensitivity analysis showed results in line with the main analysis.
CONCLUSION: The efficiency of EIRA intervention cannot be fully established and 
its recommendation should be conditioned by results on medium-long term effects.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of double-layer compared with 
single-layer uterine closure after a first caesarean section (CS) from a 
societal and healthcare perspective.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a multicentre, double-blind, randomised 
controlled trial.
SETTING: 32 hospitals in the Netherlands, 2016-2018.
PARTICIPANTS: 2292 women ≥18 years undergoing a first CS were randomly assigned 
(1:1). Exclusion criteria were: inability for counselling, previous uterine 
surgery, known menstrual disorder, placenta increta or percreta, pregnant with 
three or more fetuses. 1144 women were assigned to single-layer and 1148 to 
double-layer closure. We included 1620 women with a menstrual cycle in the main 
analysis.
INTERVENTIONS: Single-layer unlocked uterine closure and double-layer unlocked 
uterine closure with the second layer imbricating the first.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spotting days, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
societal costs at 9 months of follow-up. Missing data were imputed using 
multiple imputation.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between single-layer versus 
double-layer closure in mean spotting days (1.44 and 1.39 days; mean difference 
(md) -0.056, 95% CI -0.374 to 0.263), QALYs (0.663 and 0.658; md -0.005, 95% CI 
-0.015 to 0.005), total healthcare costs (€744 and €727; md €-17, 95% CI -273 to 
143), and total societal costs (€5689 and €5927; md €238, 95% CI -624 to 1108). 
The probability of the intervention being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay 
of €0, €10 000 and €20 000/QALY gained was 0.30, 0.27 and 0.25, respectively, 
(societal perspective), and 0.55, 0.41 and 0.32, respectively, (healthcare 
perspective).
CONCLUSION: Double-layer uterine closure is not cost-effective compared with 
single-layer uterine closure from both perspectives. If this is confirmed by our 
long-term reproductive follow-up, we suggest to adjust uterine closure technique 
guidelines.

Plant viruses trigger numerous responses in their insect vectors. Using 
iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis, early responses of the insect 
vector, the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén, SBPH), after 
acquiring Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) at 3 days and 5 days post 
first access to diseased plants (padp) were revealed. A total of 582 
differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in SBPH with a fold change >1.500 or 
<0.667 (p-value < 0.05) were identified. The proteomic analysis in SBPH at 
3 days padp revealed 106 highly abundant proteins and 193 of low abundance, 
while 5 days padp revealed 214 highly abundant proteins and 182 of low 
abundance. Among them, 51 highly abundant proteins and 42 of low abundance were 
shown consistently at both 3 days and 5 days padp. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) analysis mapping and Gene Ontology (GO) term classification 
suggested impairment of mitochondria in SBPH after RBSDV acquisition, and the 77 
out of 582 differentially abundant SBPH proteins analyzed by the STRING program 
revealed the interaction network of the mitochondrial DAPs, showing an overall 
down-regulation of mitochondrial proteins including the electron transport chain 
proteins and mitochondrial ribosome proteins. The high abundance of Parkin at 
5 days padp suggests that activation of mitophagy induced degradation of 
mitochondria occurred. Further verification of autophagy/mitophagy-related genes 
by reverse-transcription quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) in SBPH after RBSDV 
acquisition showed up-regulation of the autophagy receptors Optineurin (OPTN), 
Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1, also known as p62) and Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) 
which targets ubiquitinated damaged mitochondria during mitophagy. The 
phosphorylation of the three autophagy receptors may be up-regulated through an 
increase of transcription level TRAF-associated NFκB activator (TANK)-binding 
kinase 1 (TBK1). As a result, an overall reduction in the abundance of 
mitochondrial proteins was observed and the selective autophagic degradation was 
up-regulated through increased transcription level of OPTN, p62/SQSTM1, TAX1BP1 
and TBK1. Therefore, acquisition of RBSDV associated with up-regulated autophagy 
and selective mitochondrial degradation in SBPH suggest prevention of 
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and extension of the vector life span. 
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: RBSDV causes severe yield loss in rice plants. RBSDV is 
transmitted efficiently only through SBPH. It is important to understand how 
RBSDV infects SBPH in a persistent, circulative and propagative manner. However, 
there has been no study on the interaction between RBSDV and SBPH at the early 
acquisition stage using a proteomics approach. In this study, we combined iTRAQ 
technique and LC-MS/MS to analyze the vector proteomics at both the initial and 
latent infection stages after RBSDV acquisition and verified the results by 
RT-qPCR. Our results revealed that significantly low DAPs were involved in 
various pathways, including biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ribosomes, 
carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids and TCA cycle. Further clustering 
of the DAPs revealed significant changes in SBPH mitochondria, including 
decreased proteins in mitochondrial ribosomes and electron transport chain 
complex I, II and V. On the other hand, there was a high abundance of Parkin, 
suggesting the occurrence of mitochondria damage and subsequent Parkin-mediated 
mitophagy for clearance of impaired mitochondria. Moreover, the decreased level 
of PMPCB in terms of gene expression and protein abundance suggested decreased 
PINK1 turnover, promoting Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy. Further analysis on 
autophagy/mitophagy-related gene transcription level indicated up-regulation of 
OPTN, p62/SQSTM1, TAX1BP1 and TBK1, promoting selective autophagy in SBPH after 
RBSDV acquisition. These findings provided new insights into the effects of 
RBSDV on SBPH after early acquisition by selective degradation of mitochondria, 
especially on reprogramming of energy metabolism and decreased mitochondria 
biogenesis, to prevent apoptosis and prolong the life span of SBPH post virus 
acquisition.

Many thioredoxin-h (Trx-h) proteins, cytosolic isotypes of Trxs, have been 
functionally characterized in plants; however, the physiological function of 
Arabidopsis Trx-h2, which harbors two active site cysteine (Cys) residues and an 
N-terminal extension peptide containing a fatty acid acylation site, remains 
unclear. In this study, we investigated the physiological function of Trx-h2 by 
performing several abiotic stress treatments using trx-h1-3 knockout mutant 
lines, and found that the reductase function of Trx-h2 is critical for cold 
resistance in Arabidopsis. Plants overexpressing Trx-h2 in the trx-h2 mutant 
background (Trx-h2OE/trx-h2) showed strong cold tolerant phenotypes compared 
with Col-0 (wild type) and trx-h2 mutant plants. By contrast, 
Trx-h2(C/S)OE/trx-h2 plants expressing a variant Trx-h2 protein, in which both 
active site Cys residues were substituted by serine (Ser) residues, showed high 
cold sensitivity, similar to trx-h2 plants. Moreover, cold-responsive (COR) 
genes were highly up-regulated in Trx-h2OE/trx-h2 plants but not in trx-h2 and 
Trx-h2(C/S)OE/trx-h2 plants under cold conditions. These results explicitly 
suggest that the cytosolic Trx-h2 protein relays the external cold stress signal 
to downstream cold defense signaling cascades through its protein disulfide 
reductase function.

Is it adding up? The cumulative effect of sickness benefits on life expectancy 
in old age in 15 OECD countries 1960-2015.

Since the 1950s, high-income countries have experienced an immense increase in 
life expectancy. Previous studies have largely assessed how individual-level 
factors influence longevity, whereas cumulative dis/advantage theory (CDA) has 
in general been used to explain the relationship between individual resources 
and mortality in relation to aging. Rare studies have investigated the 
institutional impact on mortality within the framework of CDA. The research 
field is thus lacking studies that compare more than a handful of countries over 
a longer period. This study attempts to align CDA and comparative welfare state 
research by analysing the relationship between sickness benefits and life 
expectancy at age 65, comparing fifteen affluent countries over the period 1960 
to 2015. The found results demonstrate that countries with higher benefit 
coverage have a larger increase in life expectancy, among both men and women. 
The effect of income replacement was mixed and appear to depend on the share of 
population covered by sickness benefits. This institutional interplay between 
coverage and income replacement supports previous insights about the beneficial 
effects of universal programs on population health.

BACKGROUND: PLWH are living longer as a result of advancement and adherence to 
antiretroviral therapy. As the life expectancy of PLWH increases, they are at 
increased risk of hypertension and diabetes. HIV chronic co-morbidities pose a 
serious public health concern as they are linked to increased use and need of 
health services, decreased overall quality of life and increased mortality. 
While research shows that integrated care approaches applied within primary care 
settings can significantly reduce hospital admissions and mortality levels among 
patients with comorbidities, the primary care system in South Africa continues 
to be challenged with issues about the delivery of quality care.
METHODS: This study applied a phenomenological qualitative research design. IDIs 
were conducted with 24 HCPs and adults living with the comorbidity of HIV and 
either hypertension or diabetes across two provinces in South Africa. The 
objective of the research was to understand the challenges faced by HCPs and 
patients in health facilities where the ICDM model is implemented. The health 
facilities were purposively sampled. However, the HCPs were recruited through 
snowballing and the patients through reviewing the facilities' clinic records 
for participants who met the study criteria. All participants provided informed 
consent. The data was collected between March and May 2020. The findings were 
analysed inductively using thematic content analysis.
RESULTS: The challenges experienced included lack of staff capacity, unclear 
guidelines on the delivery of integrated care for patients with HIV chronic 
comorbidities, pill burden, non-disclosure, financial burden, poor knowledge of 
treatments, relocation of patients and access to treatment. Lack of support and 
integrated chronic programmes including minimal information regarding the 
management of HIV chronic comorbidities were other concerns.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes of the ICDM model need to be strengthened and scaled up
