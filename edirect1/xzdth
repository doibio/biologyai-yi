OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of a group-based 
outpatient physical therapy intervention delivered 6 weeks after primary total 
knee replacement (TKR) compared with usual care, alongside the 
Activity-Orientated Rehabilitation Following Knee Arthroplasty (ARENA) 
multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.
METHODS: The economic analyses were performed from the perspective of the health 
and social care payer. We collected resource use for health and social care and 
productivity losses and patient outcomes for 12 months after surgery to derive 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were expressed in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and incremental net monetary 
benefit statistics (INMBs) for a society willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
£20,000 per QALY gained, with sensitivity analyses to model specification and 
perspective.
RESULTS: The cost of the ARENA physical therapy classes was mean ± SD £179 ± 39 
per patient. Treatment in the year following surgery cost was, on average, 
£1,739 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -£742, £4,221) per patient in the 
intervention group (n = 89), which was an additional £346 (95% CI £38, £653) per 
patient compared with usual care (n = 91) (£1,393 [95% CI -£780, £3,568]). QALY 
benefits were 0.0506 higher (95% CI 0.009, 0.09) in the intervention group, 
corresponding to an additional 19 days in "perfect health." The ICER for the 
intervention group was £6,842 per QALY gained, and the INMB was £665 (95% CI 
£139, £1,191), with a 92% probability of being cost-effective, and no less than 
73% in all sensitivity analysis scenarios.
CONCLUSION: The addition of group-based outpatient physical therapy classes to 
usual care improves quality of life and is a cost-effective treatment option 
following TKR for a society WTP threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer plays significant role in morbidity, mortality and 
economic cost in Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the burden and trends of incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of colorectal cancer in Africa from 2010 
to 2019.
METHODS: This study was conducted according to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2019 analytic and modeling strategies. The recent GBD 2019 study provided the 
most updated and compressive epidemiological evidence of cancer incidence, 
mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and 
DALYs.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 58,000 (95% UI: 52,000-65,000), 49,000 (95% UI: 
43,000-54,000), and 1.3 million (95% UI: 1.14-1.46) incident cases, deaths and 
DALYs counts of colorectal cancer respectively in Africa. Between 2010 and 2019, 
incidence cases, death, and DALY counts of CRC were significantly increased by 
48% (95% UI: 34-62%), 41% (95% UI: 28-55%), and 41% (95% UI: 27-56%) 
respectively. Change of age-standardised rates of incidence, death and DALYs 
were increased by 11% (95% UI: 1-21%), 6% (95% UI: - 3 to 16%), and 6% (95% UI: 
- 5 to 16%) respectively from 2010 to 2019. There were marked variations of 
burden of colorectal cancer at national level from 2010 to 2019 in Africa.
CONCLUSION: Increased age-standardised death rate and DALYs of colorectal cancer 
indicates low progress in CRC standard care-diagnosis and treatment, primary 
prevention of modifiable risk factors and implementation of secondary prevention 
modality. This serious effect would be due to poor cancer infrastructure and 
policy, low workforce capacity, cancer center for diagnosis and treatment, low 
finical security and low of universal health coverage in Africa.

BACKGROUND: We assess the impact of prevention strategies regarding type 2 
diabetes as a modifiable risk factor for dementia and its consequences for the 
future number of dementia patients in Germany.
METHODS: We used a random sample of health claims data (N = 250,000) of insured 
persons aged 50+ drawn in 2014, and data on population size and death rates in 
2015 from the Human Mortality Database. Using exponential hazard models, we 
calculated age- and sex-specific transition probabilities and death rates 
between the states (no diabetes/no dementia, diabetes/no dementia, no 
diabetes/dementia, diabetes/dementia). In multi-state projections, we estimated 
the future number of dementia cases aged 75+ through 2040 depending on the 
development of the incidence of diabetes among persons without diabetes and 
without dementia, and the dementia incidence among persons with and without 
diabetes.
RESULTS: In 2015 there were 1.53 million people with dementia aged 75+ in 
Germany. A relative annual reduction in death rates of 2.5% and in dementia 
incidence in persons without diabetes of 1% will increase this number to 3.38 
million by 2040. A relative reduction of diabetes incidence by 1% annually would 
decrease dementia cases by around 30,000, while a reduction of dementia 
incidence among people with diabetes by 1% would result in 220,000 fewer 
dementia cases. Both prevention strategies combined would prevent 240,000 
dementia cases in 2040.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in life expectancy is decisive for the future number 
of people with dementia. Strategies of better diabetes treatment have the 
potential to lower the increase in the number of dementia patients in the coming 
decades.

BACKGROUND: Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become a manageable 
condition with increasing life expectancy, people living with HIV (PLHIV) are 
still often isolated from society due to stigma and discrimination. Peer support 
provides one avenue for increased social support. Given the limited research on 
peer support from the perspective of PLHIV, this study explored their 
experiences of peer support organised by healthcare professionals in an 
outpatient clinical setting.
METHODS: The study used a qualitative, descriptive research design for an 
in-depth understanding of peer support provided to PLHIV in the context of 
outpatient clinics. Healthcare professionals contributed to the recruitment of 
16 participants. We conducted in-depth interviews about participants' 
experiences of peer support, and performed a directed content analysis of the 
data. Further, we sorted the data into pre-determined categories.
RESULTS: The pre-determined categories constituted attachment, social 
integration, an opportunity for nurturance, reassurance of worth, reliable 
alliance, and guidance. The identified themes were: gained emotional support, 
disclosure behaviour allowed garnering of emotional support, non-disclosure 
promoted the need to meet a peer, experienced a sense of belonging, activated an 
opportunity for mutual support, means to re-establish belief in one's own worth, 
perceived a positive affirmation of disease management, facilitated dialogue 
about disease management, the outpatient clinic as a safe place, and a setting 
for flexible, individualised support.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the peer support experiences of PLHIV in the 
context of outpatient clinics. The participants' experiences align with previous 
findings, showing that peer support contributes to mutual emotional support 
between peers. This is particularly important in cultures of non-disclosure 
where PLHIV experience intersectional stigma. Additionally, our results show 
outpatient clinics to be supportive surroundings for facilitating peer support, 
ensuring confidentiality in peer support outreach. Therefore, peer support 
contributes positively to individualising outpatient clinic services to meet the 
changing needs of PLHIV.

BACKGROUND: In the 2021 Statistics Canada census, 18.5% of the Canadian 
population were senior (65 years and older), among those 1.7 million (4.5%) were 
aged 80 years and older. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer 
in both men and women, with its highest incidence rate in septu- and 
octogenarians. As clinicians encounter a growing number of very elderly patients 
(80 years and older) with resectable colorectal cancer, justifying major surgery 
in a comorbid population with limited life expectancy is difficult. Therefore, 
this study aims to systemically review the available literature to compare 
non-operative management to surgical resection with respect to overall survival 
and quality of life.
METHOD: We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review. We 
will include all patients above the age of 80 with resectable colorectal cancer. 
We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials 
from January 2000 onwards. We will include randomized, non-randomized controlled 
trials and observational studies comparing non-operative versus operative 
management of resectable colorectal cancer in elderly patients. The primary 
outcomes will be overall survival and mortality. Secondary outcomes will include 
quality of life, and health services/ resources utilization (e.g., treatments, 
change of level of care…). Two reviewers will independently screen all 
citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be 
resolved through discussion. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be 
appraised using the ROB-2 and ROBIN-I tools. If feasible, we will conduct random 
effects meta-analysis. Additional analyses will be conducted to explore the 
potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., study design and methodological 
quality).
DISCUSSION: This systematic review will synthesize the existing data on the 
management of colorectal cancer in the very elderly patients, and identify the 
gap in the literature for potential future research. More specifically, we aim 
to streamline non-operative outcome data on resectable colorectal cancers to aid 
clinicians' decision-making with respect to survival outcomes and quality of 
life. The results of this study will be of interest to multiple audiences 
including patients, their families, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and 
policy makers. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Neurological impairment (NI) and disability are common in sub-Saharan Africa 
(SSA), but the overall burden in terms of morbidity and mortality in older 
children remains unknown. We estimated the burden of NI in disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), years of life lost to premature mortality (YLLs), and years 
lived with disability (YLDs) for older children in a defined rural setting in 
Kenya. We used empirical and literature estimates to model the overall burden 
for children aged 5-14 years in five domains: epilepsy (lifetime and active) and 
moderate/severe cognitive, hearing, motor, and visual impairments. We obtained 
internally consistent estimates of prevalence, mortality, and transitional 
hazards using DisMod II software. Disability weights and life expectancy 
estimates were based on the global burden of disease (GBD) studies. We used the 
most plausible parameters to calculate YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs and their 
bootstrapped 95% uncertainty intervals (95%UI) for the defined area. NI in the 
five domains resulted in a total of 4587 (95%UI 4459-4715) absolute DALYs or 53 
(95%UI 39-67) DALYs per 1000 children aged 5-14 years, of which 83% were YLLs 
and 17% YLDs. Girls had significantly more YLLs and DALYs than boys (p-values 
<0.001, respectively). Besides being the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal 
outcomes, epilepsy accounted for the greatest proportion of the total burden for 
a single domain (20 DALYs per 1000, 95%UI 11-26, or 38.5% of the total DALYs). 
Visual impairment accounted for the least proportion of the total burden (6 per 
1000, 95%UI 1-17, or 12.1%). Children with NI and disability bear a 
significantly high burden of fatal and non-fatal outcomes. The burden is highest 
among girls and those with childhood-onset epilepsy. We recommend active 
identification, treatment, and rehabilitative support for the affected children 
to prevent premature mortality and improve their quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Two metrics, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), have been commonly used to measure health 
benefits associated with health interventions. This study aimed to explore the 
effect of the choice of health metric (DALY or QALY) on economic evaluation 
conclusion.
METHODS: A previous published model for a cost-utility analysis (CUA) of 
rotavirus vaccine was adapted to estimate the QALYs gained and DALYs averted 
from four rotavirus vaccines: Rotarix, RotaTeq, Rotavac, and Rotasiil. The study 
was conducted in both Burundi provider and societal perspectives over a 
five-year time horizon. Disability weights (DW) were derived from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Scenario analysis was performed to evaluate the 
impact of age weights and source of utility weight.
RESULTS: In base-case analysis, the QALYs gained ranged from 46 to 78% of the 
DALYs averted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per QALY gained 
were higher than ICER per DALY averted by 28 to 113%, leading to less favorable 
cost effectiveness. The QALYs gained from using 1-DW as utility weight were 
slightly higher than those using EQ-5D utility weight obtained from previous 
literature, yet less likely to alter CUA conclusions. When age-weighting was 
incorporated in the DALY calculation, the ICERs per DALY averted were reduced 
leading to more favorable cost effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: In case of rotavirus diarrhea, in which mortality burden is 
considered larger than morbidity due to short duration of disease, although the 
use of DALY consistently led to more favorable cost-effective result than the 
use of QALY such effects were considered small and less likely to affect the EE 
conclusion under current CET of 1 GDP per capita.

Hypersensitivity reactions to drugs have increased in the past 25 years due to 
increased exposures and availability of efficient, targeted, and personalized 
medications. Rapid drug desensitization is a clinical procedure that allows for 
the safe administration of a drug in patients with a history of such 
hypersensitivity reactions. Desensitization allows the continued use of 
first-line therapies, leading to higher efficacy of treatment, fewer side 
effects, cost-effectiveness, and increased quality of life and life expectancy 
of patients when compared with the use of second-line therapy. In this review, 
we discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how of drug desensitization.

Wage theft - employers not paying workers their legally entitled wages and 
benefits - costs workers billions of dollars annually. We tested whether 
preventing wage theft could increase U.S. life expectancy and decrease 
inequities therein. We obtained nationally representative estimates of the 
2001-2014 association between income and expected age at death for 40-year-olds 
(40 plus life expectancy at age 40) compiled from tax and Social Security 
Administration records, and estimates of the burden of wage theft from several 
sources, including estimates regarding minimum-wage violations (not paying 
workers the minimum wage) developed from Current Population Survey data. After 
modeling the relationship between income and expected age at death, we simulated 
the effects of scenarios preventing wage theft on mean expected age at death, 
assuming a causal effect of income on expected age at death. We simulated 
several scenarios, including one using data suggesting minimum-wage violations 
constituted 38% of all wage theft and caused 58% of affected workers' losses. 
Among women in the lowest income decile, mean expected age at death was 
0.17 years longer in the counterfactual scenario than observed (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.11-0.22), corresponding to 528,685 (95% CI: 346,018-711,353) 
years extended in the total 2001-2014 age-40 population. Among men in the lowest 
decile, the estimates were 0.12 (95% CI: 0.07-0.17) and 380,502 (95% CI: 
229,630-531,374). Moreover, among women, mean expected age at death in the 
counterfactual scenario increased 0.16 (95% CI: 0.06-0.27) years more among the 
lowest decile than among the highest decile; among men, the estimate was 0.12 
(95% CI: 0.03-0.21).

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy has led to profound changes in 
disease prevention and health maintenance. Because of the impact of dysbiosis on 
the host's health, it is worth considering microbiome-targeted therapies to 
attenuate or delay age-related perturbations.
AIM: The aim of the present review was to systematically evaluate the impact of 
probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics on the major events that affect 
individuals aged 65 or older.
METHODS: We performed a literature search in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials. Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) performed on 
old people and published between 2009 and 2019 were included.
RESULTS: Nine RCTs and 1 secondary analysis (n = 475, 55.8% female) were 
eligible for inclusion and retrieved in this systematic review. Overall, most 
interventions resulted in improvements in certain parameters when compared to 
control (glucose homeostasis, cognitive function, frailty phenotype, gut 
microbiota profile, immune parameters), while others remained unvariable.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of probiotics and prebiotics raises a great opportunity to 
modulate the process of aging and looks promising for health prevention in old 
adults. However, more RCTs in subjects older than 65 years are needed to

INTRODUCTION: Incarcerated populations represent a vulnerable and marginalised 
segment of society, with increased health needs and a higher burden of 
communicable and non-communicable diseases. Traditional population health 
outcomes do not capture physical, mental, emotional and social well-being. 
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes attempt to measure these 
important parameters. To date, there has not been a scoping review to summarise 
the HRQoL literature in the incarcerated population. Thus, we aim to perform 
such a review to inform health policy decisions in incarcerated populations and 
support health economic evaluations of interventions in incarcerated 
populations.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a scoping review of the literature on the 
HRQoL in the incarcerated population informed by the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the corresponding PRISMA 
Extension for Scoping Reviews. The submissions records of six electronic 
databases with peer-reviewed literature and three health technology assessment 
agencies will be searched. The search strategy was informed by recommendations 
for HRQoL reviews. We will include studies that report HRQoL, health state 
utility values or reference to quality adjusted life years or quality-adjusted 
life expectancies of incarcerated populations. No assessments of items' quality 
will be made, as the purpose of this scoping review is to synthesise and 
describe the coverage of the evidence. We will also identify knowledge gaps on 
the HRQoL in the incarcerated population.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is not required as primary 
data will not be collected. The findings of this scoping review will be used to 
inform health economic analyses for the incarcerated population and will be 
disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the influence of chronic diseases and 
poor working conditions - across educational levels - on working life expectancy 
(WLE) and working years lost (WYL) in the Dutch workforce after age 50.
METHODS: Information on demographics, chronic diseases, and working conditions 
from 11 800 Dutch workers aged 50-66 years participating in the Study on 
Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM) from 2010/2015 was 
enriched with monthly information on employment status from Statistics 
Netherlands up to 2018. In a multistate model, transitions were calculated 
between paid employment and involuntary exit (disability benefits, unemployment) 
and voluntary exit (economic inactivity, early retirement) to estimate the 
impact of education, chronic diseases, and working conditions on WLE and WYL 
between age 50 and 66.
RESULTS: Workers with a chronic disease (up to 1.01 years) or unfavorable 
working conditions (up to 0.63 years) had more WYL due to involuntary pathways 
than workers with no chronic disease or favorable working conditions. The 
differences in WYL between workers with and without a chronic disease were 
slightly higher among workers with a lower education level (male: 0.85, female: 
1.01 years) compared to workers with a high educational level (male: 0.72, 
female: 0.82 years). Given the higher prevalence of chronic diseases and 
unfavorable working conditions, WYL among lower educated workers were higher 
than among higher educated workers.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a chronic disease or unfavorable working 
conditions, more prevalent among lower educated workers, contribute 
substantially to WYL among older workers. This will increase educational 
inequalities in working careers.eers.

OBJECTIVE: The Short-Form 6-Dimension version 2 (SF-6Dv2) is the newest version 
of the Short-Form 6-Dimension (SF-6D) that is widely used to calculate 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The aim of this study was to produce Quebec 
population norms from the SF-6Dv2.
METHODS: An online survey was conducted in the adult general population. Data 
was stratified by various sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, sex, 
body mass index, history of illness, and health problems.
RESULTS: A total of 4175 respondents completed the SF-6Dv2. Mean (95% confidence 
interval) and median (interquartile range) utility scores were 0.692 
(0.684-0.700) and 0.780 (0.607-0.866), respectively. Floor and ceiling effect 
corresponded to 0.05% and 3.1%, respectively. Men, nonsmoker, higher education, 
and employed people had significantly higher scores, while lower scores were 
found for those with a history of illness and a lower life satisfaction. Those 
reporting a health problem presented significant lower mean utility scores 
ranging from 0.340 (nervous problem) to 0.623 (diabetes) for men and from 0.207 
(genitourinary) to 0.578 (diabetes) for women as compared with those without 
health problem (0.793 for men and 0.750 for women).
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to provide utility score norms for SF-6Dv2 
in the adult general population of Quebec. It also highlighted significant 
differences among various health problems that can be used to compare 
populations in studies that do not have a control group.

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 1 year of romosozumab followed by 
alendronate versus oral bisphosphonates alone in women with postmenopausal 
osteoporosis at very high risk for fracture in Canada. Results showed that 
romosozumab sequenced to alendronate is a cost-effective treatment option, 
dominating both alendronate and risedronate alone.
PURPOSE: To demonstrate the value of romosozumab sequenced to alendronate 
compared to alendronate or risedronate alone, for the treatment of osteoporosis 
in postmenopausal women with a history of osteoporotic fracture and who are at 
very high risk for future fracture in Canada.
METHODS: A Markov model followed a hypothetical cohort of postmenopausal 
osteoporotic women at very high risk for future fractures, to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of romosozumab and alendronate compared to oral 
bisphosphonates alone. A total treatment period of 5 years was assumed. 
Quality-adjusted life years and costs were estimated for each comparator across 
health states defined by different types of fragility fractures.
RESULTS: Romosozumab/alendronate was associated with a lifetime gain of 0.103 
and 0.127 QALYs and a cost reduction of $343 and $3805, relative to alendronate 
and risedronate, respectively. These results were driven by a reduction of the 
number of fractures (2561 per 1000 patients, versus 2700 for alendronate and 
2724 for risedronate over lifetime). Romosozumab/alendronate had the highest 
probability of being cost-effective, relative to alendronate and risedronate, at 
any willingness to pay threshold value.
CONCLUSION: Romosozumab/alendronate was associated with reduced costs and 
greater benefit relative to other comparators. Probabilistic, deterministic, and 
scenario analyses indicate that romosozumab/alendronate represents the best 
value for money; the uncertainty analyses are robust, and therefore romosozumab 
should be considered for reimbursement by public drug plans in Canada .

34. Identification and assessment of rehabilitation needs after traumatic injury:
 Rehabilitation After Traumatic Injury: Evidence review A.1/A.2.

National Guideline Alliance (UK).

London: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); 2022 Jan.
NICE Evidence Reviews Collection.

Traumatic injury often results in people living with disability that results in 
a reduced quality of life. An essential part of good trauma care is to maximise 
access to rehabilitation to assist physical and psychological recovery after 
injury. A proportion of people will have complex needs necessitating inpatient 
rehabilitation from a multidisciplinary team with expertise. Some people will 
need ongoing support, rehabilitation and re-enablement once they are discharged 
home. People in major trauma centres with an injury severity score of 9 or more, 
should be assessed by a consultant in Rehabilitation medicine within 3 calendar 
days and have a rehabilitation prescription formulated. The specialist team 
including nurses should complete their assessment and recommendations for early 
phase rehabilitation. The rehabilitation prescription is used to document the 
rehabilitation needs of patients and identify how their needs should be 
addressed. It should describe physical, functional, vocational, educational, 
cognitive, psychological and social rehabilitation needs of a patient. The 
prescription was designed an extension of a discharge/transfer summary and 
should include ongoing health and social care plans so that everyone is working 
from one document, which is regularly reviewed and updated. However, the 
Rehabilitation prescription has been found to be poorly implemented and in two 
thirds of centres the prescription has not been passed on to patients (NCASRI 
Report 2016). There are also concerns that the rehabilitation prescriptions are 
not been has not been adequately monitored or followed up after discharge. Only 
the major trauma centres have been incentivised to formulate a rehabilitation 
prescription, so those being admitted straight to trauma units, or who have 
Injury severity scores of less than 9 will not get a rehabilitation 
prescription. Access to a Consultant in Rehabilitation varies across England, 
and there is less likely to be provision within a trauma unit, even in a 
peripatetic model. There is no recommended levels for specialist staffing AHP 
and specialist nurses within trauma units, nor standardisation for psychology 
provision. The objectives of the quantitative reviews were to examine what 
should be included in initial rehabilitation needs identification and assessment 
in people after traumatic injury. These questions focused on the initial 
holistic assessment of any rehabilitation needs. We therefore did not look at 
specific validated tools, as the use of these are for the second level of 
assessment by different specialists of any needs identified in the initial 
holistic needs assessment/screening (which was not the focus of these questions. 
The objectives of the qualitative reviews were to identify the views and 
preferences of people after traumatic injury that resulted in complex 
rehabilitation needs who have used rehabilitation services about assessment of 
their rehabilitation needs.

PURPOSE: To express a global view of care quality in major causes of mortality 
and morbidity in children and adolescences.
METHODS: We used primary epidemiologic indicators from the Global Burden of 
Disease 1990-2017 database. We have created four secondary indices from six 
primary indices in order to assess the care quality parameters. We conducted a 
principal component analysis on incidence, prevalence, mortality, Years of Life 
Lost (YLLs), Years Lived with Disability (YLDs), and Disability Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs) to create an index presented by quality-of-care index (QCI) to 
compare different countries.
RESULTS: The global QCI scores of respiratory infection, enteric infection, 
leukemia, foreign body aspiration, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, 
dermatitis, road injury, and neonatal disorders have improved remarkably. These 
causes showed equal distribution of qualified care for both sexes. The global 
trend of QCI score for mental health showed a steady pattern during the same 
time and disparities favoring females was evident. The quality of care for these 
causes was notably higher in developed areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The global QCI revealed a universal growth in major causes of death 
and morbidity in <20y during 28 years. Quality of care is an associate of the 
level of country's development. Despite effective interventions, inequities 
still remain. Implementation of policies to invest in quality improvement and 
inequality elimination is needed.

BACKGROUND: Despite the long-standing experience of rating the evidence for 
clinical preventive services, the delivery of effective clinical preventive 
services in Canada and elsewhere is less than optimal. We outline an approach 
used in British Columbia to assist in determining which effective clinical 
preventive services are worth doing.
METHODS: We calculated the clinically preventable burden and cost-effectiveness 
for 28 clinical preventive services that received a 'strong or conditional 
(weak) recommendation for' by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care 
or an 'A' or 'B' rating by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. 
Clinically preventable burden is the total quality adjusted life years that 
could be gained if the clinical preventive services were delivered at 
recommended intervals to a British Columbia birth cohort of 40,000 individuals 
over the years of life that the service is recommended. Cost-effectiveness is 
the net cost per quality adjusted life year gained.
RESULTS: Clinical preventive services with the highest population impact and 
best value for money include services that address tobacco use in adolescents 
and adults, exclusive breastfeeding, and screening for hypertension and other 
cardiovascular disease risk factors followed by appropriate pharmaceutical 
treatment. In addition, alcohol misuse screening and brief counseling, one-time 
screening for hepatitis C virus infection in British Columbia adults born 
between 1945 and 1965, and screening for type 2 diabetes approach these 
high-value clinical preventive services.
CONCLUSIONS: These results enable policy makers to say with some confidence what 
preventive manoeuvres are worth doing but further work is required to determine 
the best way to deliver these services to all those eligible and to establish 
what supportive services are required. After all, if a clinical preventive 
service is worth doing, it is worth doing well.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy and improved medical technology allow 
increasing numbers of elderly patients to undergo cardiac surgery. Elderly 
patients may be at greater risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. 
Complications can lead to worsened quality of life, shortened life expectancy 
and higher healthcare costs. Reducing perioperative complications, especially 
severe adverse events, is key to improving outcomes in patients undergoing 
cardiac surgery. The objective of this study is to determine whether 
perioperative lipid-lowering medication use is associated with a reduced risk of 
complications and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
METHODS: After IRB approval, we reviewed charts of 9,518 patients who underwent 
cardiac surgery with CPB at three medical centers between July 2001 and June 
2015. The relationship between perioperative lipid-lowering treatment and 
postoperative outcome was investigated. 3,988 patients who underwent CABG met 
inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Patients were divided into lipid-lowering 
or non-lipid-lowering treatment groups.
RESULTS: A total of 3,988 patients were included in the final analysis. Compared 
to the patients without lipid-lowering medications, the patients with 
lipid-lowering medications had lower postoperative neurologic complications and 
overall mortality (P < 0.05). Propensity weighted risk-adjustment showed that 
lipid-lowering medication reduced in-hospital total complications (odds ratio 
(OR) = 0.856; 95% CI 0.781-0.938; P < 0.001); all neurologic complications 
(OR = 0.572; 95% CI 0.441-0.739; P < 0.001) including stroke (OR = 0.481; 95% CI 
0.349-0.654; P < 0.001); in-hospital mortality (OR = 0.616; 95% CI 0.432-0.869; 
P = 0.006; P < 0.001); and overall mortality (OR = 0.723; 95% CI 0.634-0.824; 
P < 0.001). In addition, the results indicated postoperative lipid-lowering 
medication use was associated with improved long-term survival in this patient 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative lipid-lowering medication use was associated with 
significantly reduced postoperative adverse events and improved overall outcome 
in elderly patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB.

BACKGROUND: Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) is a major public health issue 
worldwide. We analyzed the global, regional, and national burden of HHD between 
the years 1990 and 2019 in relation to age, gender, and socioeconomic factors.
METHODS: The prevalence and death rates, the disability adjusted life-years 
(DALY), and the corresponding age-standardized rates of HHD were extracted from 
the Global Burden of Disease study 2019. The epidemiological trends were 
evaluated by calculating the estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) of the 
above variates.
RESULTS: A total of 19.60 million HHD cases were documented in 2019 compared to 
7.82 million in 1990, corresponding to an EAPC of 0.17. Contrarily, the global 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR) and age-standardized DALYs decreased with 
respective EAPCs of - 0.74 and - 1.02. HHD mostly occurred in people aged over 
65. The disease burden of HHD varied considerably between countries, and 
univariate linear regression indicated that many socioeconomic variables had 
significantly negative correlations with age-standardized DALY rate.
CONCLUSION: HHD cases have increased over the last three decades; however the 
mortality rate has declined. Multi-faceted improvements in health, education and 
income could help to alleviate the disease burden of HHD, specially in some 
regions with lower socio-demographic index and higher ASDR.
