According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 47 million people display 
mental health disorders Worldwide. In addition, epidemiological studies have 
shown that the extension of life expectancy and the increase in aged population 
will significantly impact the prevalence of several mental impairments. Although 
there are strategies for preventing and alleviating mental illnesses, such as 
pharmacological and psychological approaches, limited results have been 
observed. Thus, the search for new therapeutics for managing psychiatric 
disorders has explored multiple roads. In recent years, it has been demonstrated 
that physical activity and exercise promote health benefits. On the other hand, 
among the neurobiological systems that participate in the genesis and 
development of mental disruptions, the endocannabinoid system has been suggested 
as an active player. Supporting this hypothesis, data suggest that the elements 
comprising the endocannabinoid system, such as the CB1/CB2 cannabinoid 
receptors, endogenous ligands (N-arachidonoylethanolamine [anandamide, AEA] and 
2- arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]), transporters and the enzymes involved in the 
biosynthesis and degradation of the AEA and 2-AG, modulate mental diseases. In 
this review, we discuss that the endocannabinoid system might be considered as a 
modulator for the positive outcomes of exercise in the management of mental 
disorders. Clinically, this promising field might be exploited by targeting the 
elements of the endocannabinoid system aimed to increase the exercise benefits 
applied to patients with mental illnesses.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic threatening 
millions of people worldwide. Yet studies specifically assessing the geriatric 
population are scarce. We aimed to examine the participation of elderly patients 
in therapeutic or prophylactic trials on COVID-19.
METHODS: In this review, randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 12) comparing 
therapeutic or prophylactic interventions registered on preprint repositories 
and/or published since December 2019 were analyzed. We searched in PubMed, 
leading journals websites, and preprint repositories for RCTs and large 
observational studies. We aimed to describe the age of included patients, the 
presence of an upper age limit and of adjusted analyses on age, any exclusion 
criteria that could limit participation of elderly adults such as comorbidities, 
cognitive impairment, limitation of life expectancy; and the assessment of 
long-term outcomes such as the need of rehabilitation or institutionalization. 
Mean participant ages were reported and compared with observational studies.
RESULTS: Twelve RCTs assessing drug therapy for COVID-19 were included. Mean age 
of patients included in RCTs was 56.3 years. An upper age limit was applied in 
three published trials (25%) and in 200/650 (31%) trials registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov . One trial reported a subgroup analysis in patients ≥65. 
Patients were excluded for liver-function abnormalities in eight trials, renal 
disease in six, cardiac disease or risk of torsade de pointes in five, and four 
for cognitive or mental criteria, which are frequent comorbidities in the oldest 
patients. Only three trials allowed a family member to provide consent. Patients 
enrolled in RCTs were on average 20 years younger than those included in large 
(n ≥ 1000) observational studies. Seven studies had as their primary outcome a 
clinical endpoint, but none reported cognitive, functional or quality of life 
outcomes or need for rehabilitation or long-term care facility placement.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients are clearly underrepresented in RCTs, although 
they comprise the population hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term 
outcomes such as the need of rehabilitation or institutionalization were not 
reported. Future investigations should target specifically this vulnerable 
population.

The clinical picture associated with a Transport and Golgi Organization 2 
(TANGO2) gene bi-allelic mutation is represented by encephalopathy and 
rhabdomyolysis marked by cardiac rhythm disorders and neurological regression. 
The presentation of encephalopathy is diverse and can range from isolated 
language delay and cognitive impairment in a child to multiple disabilities and 
spastic quadriparesis. Hypothyroidism has also been frequently reported. This 
article presents the clinical phenotype of seven children with a TANGO2 
bi-allelic mutation. The mutation was found by sequencing a panel of genes 
associated with rhabdomyolysis. While the clinical picture represents 
generalized cases, there is phenotypic variability in, for example, the degree 
of disability for each patient. A TANGO2 gene mutation, nevertheless, represents 
a serious illness with a limited life expectancy due to an unpredictable risk of 
cardiac rhythm disorder and death, particularly during rhabdomyolysis. Although 
the natural history of the disease presents an evolution of rhabdomyolysis 
triggered by infections or effort, an early diagnosis is difficult due in part 
to the fact that there is a lack of specific biochemical marker or identifying 
symptoms in the early presentation of the disease. Clinicians must therefore 
consider the TANGO2 gene when confronted with rhabdomyolysis in a patient 
suffering from an early developmental disorder. In the meantime, management of 
the disease remains purely symptomatic.

OBJECTIVES: Decision-making in older patients with cancer can be complex, as 
benefits of treatment should be weighed against possible side-effects and 
life-expectancy. A novel care pathway was set up incorporating geriatric 
assessment into treatment decision-making for older cancer patients. Treatment 
decisions could be modified following discussion in an onco-geriatric 
multidisciplinary team (MDT). We assessed the effect of treatment modifications 
on outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in the surgical 
department of a University Hospital. Patients of 70 years and older with a solid 
malignancy were included. All patients underwent a nurse-led geriatric 
assessment (GA) and were discussed in an onco-geriatric MDT. This could result 
in a modified or an unchanged treatment advice compared to the regular tumor 
board. Primary outcome was one-year mortality. Secondary outcomes were 
post-operative complications and days spent in hospital in the first year after 
inclusion.
RESULTS: For the 184 patients in the analyses, the median age was 77.5 years and 
41.8% were female. For 46 patients (25%), the treatment advice was modified by 
the onco-geriatric MDT. There was no significant difference in one-year 
mortality between the unchanged and modified group (29.7% versus 26.1%, 
p = 0.7). There were, however, significantly fewer days spent in hospital 
(median 5 vs 8.5 days p = 0.02) and fewer grade II or higher postoperative 
complications (13.3% versus 35.5% p = 0.005) in the modified group.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating geriatric assessment in decision-making did not lead 
to excess one-year mortality, but did result in fewer complications and days 
spent in hospital.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effects of walking exercise using a 
wearable device and functional wear on spinal alignment and jump performance.
METHODS: In total, 27 female college soccer players were randomly divided into 
two groups: trunk solution (TS) and compression garments (CGs). Spinal 
alignment, jump performance, and electromyography activity during the jump 
performance of the two groups were measured after a 20-min walking exercise. The 
values for each group were compared t pre- and post-intervention.
RESULTS: The flexibility of the lower thoracic vertebrae in spinal alignment was 
increased during extension in the TS group. However, the post-value of the 
abdominal external oblique muscle during a countermovement jump (CMJ) was 
significantly lower than its pre-value (p < 0.05). In addition, even though 
spinal alignment was not affected in the CG group, post-values of the jump 
height during squat jump and CMJ were significantly higher than their pre-values 
(p < 0.05). Furthermore, the post-value of the biceps femoris during the 
countermovement jump with arm was significantly lower than its pre-value 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that walking exercise using TS may increase the 
range of motion of the lower thoracic vertebrae in athletes and reduce the 
muscular activity of the vastus lateralis during CMJ. Additionally, although 
spinal aliment is not affected, the jump height may increase using CGs.

Cluster Analysis of Early Postnatal Biochemical Markers May Predict Development 
of Retinopathy of Prematurity.

PURPOSE: Growth factors and inflammatory and angiogenetic proteins are involved 
in the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, no early 
biochemical markers are in clinical use to predict ROP. By performing cluster 
analysis of multiple biomarkers, we aimed to determine patient groups with high 
and low risk for developing ROP.
METHODS: In total, 202 protein markers in plasma were quantified by proximity 
extension assay from 35 extremely preterm infants on day 2 of life. Infants were 
sorted in groups by automated two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of all 
biomarkers. ROP was classified as stages I to III with or without surgical 
treatment. Predictive biomarkers were evaluated by analysis of variance and 
detected differences by two-sided paired t-test with Bonferroni corrections for 
multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Differences in 39 biochemical markers divided infants without ROP into 
two control groups (control 1, n = 7; control 2, n = 5; P < 0.05). Sixty-six 
biochemical markers defined differences between the control groups (n = 13) and 
all ROP infants (n = 23; P < 0.05). PARK7, VIM, MPO, CD69, and NEMO were 
markedly increased in control 1 compared to all ROP infants (P < 0.001). Lower 
TNFRSF4 and higher HER2 and GAL appeared in infants with ROP as compared to 
control 1 and/or 2 (P < 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that early elevated levels of PARK7, VIM, MPO, 
CD69, and NEMO may be associated with lower risk of developing ROP. Lower levels 
of TNFRSF4 with higher levels of HER2 and GAL may predict ROP development.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Cluster analysis of early postnatal biomarkers may help 
to identify infants with low or high risk of developing ROP.

Mucopolysaccharidoses I and II: Brief Review of Therapeutic Options and 
Supportive/Palliative Therapies.

Gyeonggi-do 17104, Republic of Korea.

Purpose. Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are group of inherited lysosomal storage 
diseases caused by mutations of enzymes involved in catalyzing different 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). MPS I and MPS II exhibit both somatic and 
neurological symptoms with a relatively high disease incidence. Hematopoietic 
stem cell therapy (HSCT) and intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have 
had a significant impact on the treatment and comprehension of disease. This 
review is aimed at providing a comprehensive evaluation of the pros and cons of 
HSCT and ERT, as well as an up-to-date knowledge of new drugs under development. 
In addition, multiple disease management strategies for the uncontrollable 
manifestations of MPS I and MPS II to improve patients' quality of life are 
presented. Findings. Natural history of MPS I and MPS II shows that somatic and 
neurological symptoms occur earlier in severe forms of MPS I than in MPS II. ERT 
increases life expectancy and alleviates some of the somatic symptoms, but 
musculoskeletal, ophthalmological, and central nervous system (CNS) 
manifestations are not controlled. Additionally, life-long treatment burdens and 
immunogenicity restriction are unintended consequences of ERT application. HSCT, 
another treatment method, is effective in controlling the CNS symptoms and hence 
has been adopted as the standard treatment for severe types of MPS I. However, 
it is ineffective in MPS II, which can be explained by the relatively late 
diagnosis. In addition, several factors such as transplant age limits or 
graft-versus-host disease in HSCT have limited its application for patients. 
Novel therapies, including BBB-penetrable-ERT, gene therapy, and substrate 
reduction therapy, are under development to control currently unmanageable 
manifestations. BBB-penetrable-ERT is being studied comprehensively in the hopes 
of being used in the near future as a method to effectively control CNS 
symptoms. Gene therapy has the potential to "cure" the disease with a one-time 
treatment rather than just alleviate symptoms, which makes it an attractive 
treatment strategy. Several clinical studies on gene therapy reveal that 
delivering genes directly into the brain achieves better results than 
intravenous administration in patients with neurological symptoms. Considering 
new drugs are still in clinical stage, disease management with close monitoring 
and supportive/palliative therapy is of great importance for the time being. 
Proper rehabilitation therapy, including physical and occupational therapy, 
surgical intervention, or medications, can benefit patients with uncontrolled 
musculoskeletal, respiratory, ophthalmological, and neurological manifestations.

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of slow-speed resistance 
training with low intensity (SRT) on muscle power output in elite futsal players 
with respect to traditional resistance training. The authors hypothesized that 
the muscle deoxygenation during SRT causes early recruitment of fast twitch 
fibers that would positively affect strength and power performance. Thirty male 
elite futsal players were recruited and randomly assigned either to SRT group or 
to traditional resistance training (TRT) group. All players underwent an 8-weeks 
experimental protocol consisting of 2 training sessions per week at both leg 
curl and leg extension machines. In the SRT, players lifted 50% of one maximum 
repetition (1RM) involving 3 s for eccentric and concentric actions. In the TRT, 
players lifted 80% of 1RM involving 1 s for eccentric and concentric actions. 
All players were tested twice (pre and post) for sprint and jump performances, 
maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) and maximal isokinetic peak torque 
(Peak TQ) and total work (TW) at 60 and 120°/s (on knee extensors and flexors). 
The two groups presented remarkable differences in the within-group changes for 
all the variables. SRT exhibited greater improvements in both Peak TQ and TW for 
knee extensors and flexors at 120°/s. Conversely, TRT showed greater 
improvements in MVC, and in both Peak TQ and TW for knee extensors and flexors 
at 60°/s, except for Peak TQ of the knee extensors, where no significant 
difference was found between TRT and SRT. Countermovement jump showed a decrease 
in eccentric time and an increase in concentric force in SRT group. SRT and TRT 
resulted effective to enhance the strength performance indices during the 
8-weeks experimental protocol. Peak torque at 120°/s explained more of the 
contractile characteristic effects of SRT training than MVC, suggesting that 
slow-speed training can cause fast twitch fibers hypertrophy in elite athletes. 
Since slow-speed training is supposed to produce a decreased exercise-induced 
muscle damage, SRT method is a suitable option in strength training for futsal 
and team sports.

Do Former Elite Athletes Live Longer? New Evidence From German Olympic Athletes 
and a First Model Description.

The positive effects of physical activity and recreational sports on health have 
been well-examined and are well-proven. In contrast, the consequences of 
extensive elite sports on life expectancy and mortality rates have been 
described in significantly less unique and comprehensive terms. There is a lack 
of models that systematically summarize the factors influencing the life span of 
elite athletes. Therefore, this study identifies the difference between all 
6,066 German participants in Olympic Games between 1956 and 2016 and the total 
population, as well as between participants from the Federal Republic of Germany 
(FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and between the genders. 
Currently, the survival rate of German Olympians is lower compared to the 
general population. On the contrary, it was found that Olympic success 
represents a linear risk for survival probability. While different types of 
sports do not exhibit any differences, gender and origin (FRG vs. GDR) do 
represent a significant risk factor. These results are combined with the current 
state of research to create an impact model of factors influencing the life span 
of elite athletes.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease 
that is associated with reduced life expectancy. The disease is heritable and an 
extensive repertoire of genetic variants have been identified. The gut 
microbiota might represent an environmental risk factor for rheumatoid 
arthritis. We aimed to assess whether known rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles 
were associated with the gut microbiota in a large population who do not have 
rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study done in the UK and Switzerland, we used 
genotyping and microbiota data from previous studies of the TwinsUK cohort, 
excluding participants who had ever had a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, as 
well as their unaffected co-twins. We used blood samples for genotyping and 
stool samples for the assessment of the gut microbiota. We generated a polygenic 
risk score (PRS) for rheumatoid arthritis in 1650 TwinsUK participants without 
the disease, based on 233 GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms 
associated with rheumatoid arthritis. We validated the PRS using logistic 
regression against rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis in 2686 UK Biobank individuals 
with a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Amplicon sequence variants 
(ASVs) were generated from 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples and 
assessed for association with the PRS for rheumatoid arthritis. We validated the 
findings in an independent sample comprised of first-degree relatives of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the SCREEN-RA cohort. Differential 
abundance of ASVs present in more than 5% of samples, grouped by ASV taxon 
annotation, against the rheumatoid arthritis PRS as a continuous variable was 
assessed using fixed-effects covariates. To account for multiple testing, the 
false discovery rate calculation was applied to all p values to generate q 
values, with a significance threshold of 0·05 determined a priori.
FINDINGS: We found that presence of Prevotella spp were positively associated 
with the rheumatoid arthritis PRS in TwinsUK participants (q<1 × 10-7). This 
finding was validated in SCREEN-RA participants (n=133) carrying established 
shared epitope risk alleles (q=0·0011). We also found an association between 
Prevotella spp and presence of preclinical rheumatoid arthritis phases 
(q=0·021).
INTERPRETATION: Prevotella spp in the gut microbiota are associated with the 
rheumatoid arthritis genotype in the absence of rheumatoid arthritis, including 
in individuals at high risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings 
suggest that host genotype is associated with microbiota profile before disease 
onset.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, many national and international 
surgical societies have produced guidelines regarding the management of surgical 
patients. During the mitigation phase of the pandemic, most documents suggested 
to consider postponing elective procedures, unless this might have impacted the 
life expectancy of patients. As awareness and knowledge about COVID-19 are 
gradually increasing, and as we enter a phase when surgical services are 
resuming their activities, surgical strategies have to adapt to this rapidly 
evolving scenario. This is particularly relevant when considering screening 
policies and the associated findings. We herein describe a risk-based approach 
to the management of patients with surgical diseases, which might be useful in 
order to limit the risks for healthcare workers and patients, while allowing for 
resuming elective surgical practice safely.

Background: The clinical value of antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) as a tumor 
marker for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is still controversial. Materials 
& methods: We studied 110 TgAb positive DTC patients who underwent total 
thyroidectomy and 131I therapies. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted 
to analyze the association between prognostic factors and disease outcomes. 
Results & conclusion: Pre-ablation TgAb levels and the changes of TgAb in 6-12 
months after the first 131I therapy were risk factors for disease outcome in 
patients younger than 55, while extrathyroid extension was a risk factor in 
patients older than 55. The median TgAb half-life was 7.7 months and the median 
time for TgAb positivity to become negative was 15.8 months. The dynamics of 
TgAb within the first year after remnant ablation could predict disease outcome 
for DTC patients.

The world population is aging. With increased life expectancy comes increased 
risk of major health problems that affect the health and well-being of older 
adults. Adequate levels of physical activity as specified by current global 
guidelines can reduce the risk of health problems in older adults. However, 
fewer than half of older adults are sufficiently active, and thus are unlikely 
to achieve these health benefits. Older adults living in residential aged care 
are even more sedentary, with multiple health issues and comorbidities. While 
meeting physical activity guidelines confers the greatest benefit for physical 
function, the practicality of adherence to these guidelines for older people who 
are not healthy and have complex medical issues is questionable. This special 
interest paper discusses research evidence on the topic of physical activity for 
older people across the health spectrum, with and without multiple 
comorbidities. This discussion is informed by professional experience, and 
suggests practical recommendations to positively impact physical activity 
engagement in the older adult population.

An accurate 3D reconstruction of the hip is mandatory to enhance clinical 
outcomes and to help increasing the implants life expectancy. These goals may be 
difficult to achieve in some patients with outlier anatomy. Custom stem 
technology is a reliable solution to treat degenerated hip patients having such 
an atypical hip anatomy. In our practice 12% of patients require a custom stem 
to achieve an accurate reconstruction of their proximal femur anatomy. 
Performing 3D planning for all osteoarthritic hip patients and checking 
intraoperative anatomical parameters are key steps to anticipate the surgical 
difficulties, select the appropriate implants, and restore normal hip 
biomechanics.

Hip and knee arthroplasties are life-changing procedures, reducing pain and 
restoring function after end-stage arthrosis. Almost 90% of patients who have 
undergone hip arthroplasty, and 82% after knee arthroplasty, report improvement 
in quality of life after surgery [1]; this leaves a significant number of 
dissatisfied patients. The modern surgeon can make decisions regarding surgical 
approach, implant design and component orientation. However, it is challenging 
to gain proficiency in a wide variety of surgical configurations. A smaller 
repertoire is technically and economically more feasible, and thus a 
one-size-fits-all approach is commonplace. Hip and knee arthroplasties are 
forgiving procedures, most frequently performed in older patients without high 
functional demands. The future arthroplasty surgeon is faced with new 
challenges—patients with higher demand, expectations and longer life expectancy, 
in addition to an increasing burden of revision surgery. Here, we discuss ‘a la 
carte’ joint replacement, which is both patient specific and bone/soft tissue 
conservative. It may improve overall satisfaction while conserving bone stock in 
the event of future revision surgery.

Stagnation of life expectancy in Korea in 2018: A cause-specific decomposition 
analysis.

Research Center, Seoul, South Korea.

According to the most recent annual report released by Korea Statistics, the 
life expectancy at birth (for both sexes) in 2018 was 82.7 years, an increase of 
0.0 years over 2017, reflecting the first stagnation in life expectancy since 
1960. In this study, a time-series analysis was conducted of trends in life 
expectancy from 2003 to 2018, and causes of death were analyzed using the 
Kannisto-Thatcher method and the Arriaga decomposition method. The time trend 
analysis of yearly life expectancy changes indicated that, in Korea, there was a 
tendency for the yearly increase in life expectancy between 2003 and 2018 to 
decrease by 0.0211 years per calendar year. The contribution of cardiovascular 
diseases, the most important contributor to the life expectancy increase in 
Korea, gradually decreased over this period. The contribution of cardiovascular 
diseases to the life expectancy increase was 0.506 years in 2003-2006, but this 
contribution decreased to 0.218 years in 2015-2018. The positive contributions 
of ill-defined causes and external causes to life expectancy increase detected 
in previous periods were not evident in 2015-2018. Diseases of the respiratory 
system made the largest negative contribution both between 2015 and 2018 and 
between 2017-2018. The life expectancy stagnation in 2018 could be understood as 
the combined effect of (a) decreasing momentum in the increase of life 
expectancy and (b) a chance event in 2018 involving life expectancy. Currently, 
it is difficult to judge whether the stagnation of life expectancy in 2018 is 
temporary, and further analyses of life expectancy and contributing causes of 
death in the future are needed.

The prebiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides is likely to have been accompanied by 
the synthesis of noncanonical nucleotides including the threo-nucleotide 
building blocks of TNA. Here, we examine the ability of activated 
threo-nucleotides to participate in nonenzymatic template-directed 
polymerization. We find that primer extension by multiple sequential 
threo-nucleotide monomers is strongly disfavored relative to ribo-nucleotides. 
Kinetic, NMR and crystallographic studies suggest that this is due in part to 
the slow formation of the imidazolium-bridged TNA dinucleotide intermediate in 
primer extension, and in part because of the greater distance between the 
attacking RNA primer 3'-hydroxyl and the phosphate of the incoming 
threo-nucleotide intermediate. Even a single activated threo-nucleotide in the 
presence of an activated downstream RNA oligonucleotide is added to the primer 
10-fold more slowly than an activated ribonucleotide. In contrast, a single 
activated threo-nucleotide at the end of an RNA primer or in an RNA template 
results in only a modest decrease in the rate of primer extension, consistent 
with the minor and local structural distortions revealed by crystal structures. 
Our results are consistent with a model in which heterogeneous primordial 
oligonucleotides would, through cycles of replication, have given rise to 
increasingly homogeneous RNA strands.

huangyi@ntu.edu.cn.

BACKGROUND: Economy development and income are compactly associated with 
mortality of infant, children, young people, and mid age all over the world, and 
high income brings higher life expectancy, aging rate and 80+ rate as a result. 
On the contrary, the relationship between income and centenarian rate is 
obscure, in China, low income regions have lower life expectancy, lower 80+ rate 
but higher 90+ rate and 100+ rate before 2000, but 90+ rate and centenarian rate 
in low income regions fall behind high income regions after 2010.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between regional 
economic performance and centenarian rate in long period.
METHOD: Gravity center of five longevity indicators, demographic methodology 
between age-specific mortality rate and centenarian rate were conducted of 31 
provinces in China from 1982 to 2018. We also explored the association between 
centenarian rate and per capita income using binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: higher income brings better medical care and mortality rate is sharply 
decreased, among all age stages, the age 70-84 has the highest number of death, 
and will get most number of extra lives when the mortality rate decreases, and 
then 80+ rate will be increased immediately. Meanwhile, the extra 70-84 years 
people increased denominator of 90+ rate and centenarian rate, then 90+ rate and 
centenarian rate in higher income region will be fall behind. 10-20 years later, 
benefited from additional 70-84 years population, the number of 90+ will be 
largely increased. 20-30 years later, the number of 100+ will be largely 
increased too.
CONCLUSION: Income is positively related with lower mortality rate of oldest-old 
and higher 90+ rate and centenarian rate, although the effect will be lagged for 
10-20 years and 20-30 years, respectively.

The development of enhanced half-life recombinant factor VIII (EHL-rFVIII) 
concentrates has improved the management of hemophilia. Furthermore, the chance 
of maintaining higher trough levels has allowed higher protection from bleeding 
and, in turn, improved safely performance for certain types of physical 
activity. The first technology used to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of 
factor VIII (FVIII) was fusion with the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G. More 
recently, conjugation to hydrophilic polymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG) has 
been demonstrated to prolong plasma half-life of FVIII by means of a reduction 
in clearance of the molecule due to steric hindrance by PEG covering the 
protein. Here we report results of a systematic review of pivotal studies on 
EHL-rFVIII concentrates. Significant heterogeneity is observed among different 
studies on EHL-rFVIII concentrates, and direct comparisons should be avoided. 
The annualized bleeding rate has ranged between 1.2 and 1.9 in different 
EHL-rFVIII concentrates, with a progressive further decrease during extension 
phases of pivotal studies. Zero bleeding was reported by 40 to 45% of patients. 
Overall, the emerging treatment options seem to be highly effective and safe, 
associated with a decreased dosing interval to twice weekly or less, which 
reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the burden of treatment. Overall, 
further information is needed from real-life settings to permit differentiation 
between EHL-FVIII concentrates and for individualizing treatment.

Graham flour is a form of whole wheat flour made by grinding the endosperm and 
is thus also the most nutritious. Generally, the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO) 
catalyzes two different reactions in the presence of molecular oxygen: the 
hydroxylation of monophenols to ortho-diphenol and the oxidation of o-diphenol 
to o-quinone. The purpose of the work was to inactivate PPO activity to extend 
the shelf life of graham flour and at the same time preserve all the of its 
high-quality properties. The influence of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) treatment on 
PPO activity in graham flour was investigated. First, graham flour was exposed 
to scCO2 conditions, then the proteins were extracted, and in the last step the 
concentration of total proteins and the specific activity of the PPO enzyme were 
determined by spectrophotometric assay. PPO activity decreased with an increase 
in treatment pressure. Furthermore, the flour quality characteristics that meet 
all needs for wheat end-use products after scCO2 treatment have been preserved. 
No major changes in the structure of the granulate or shape of the flour 
particles were observed. A slightly reduced value of the moisture content in 
scCO2-treated graham flour also implies an extension of the shelf life.
