women, more middle-aged persons are confronted with the care needs of younger 
and older generations while they themselves are still employed. Aim: The 
objective of this manuscript is to review the body of knowledge about employed 
people caring simultaneously for underaged children and care-dependent 
relatives. Methods: The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, GeroLit, CC 
Med, SOWIPORT Gesis, PsycINFO and BASE were searched without any time 
limitations. Publications in German and English were included into this scoping 
review regardless of the study design. Results: A total of 85 studies from 
Western countries were included. Research activity is centered in North America 
and there are only limited empirical findings from the German-speaking regions. 
Nearly 70 % of the studies used a quantitative design. Research questions 
address the consequences of adopting multiple roles and the compatibility of 
different areas of life. In total, role theoretical perspectives predominate. 
Conclusions: The findings show that little attention has been paid to this 
specific issue in German-speaking regions. The methodical limitations and 
inadequate theoretical differentiation of the studies led to partly 
contradictory results. Future research should take the complexity of this living 
situation into account while considering methodical approaches and theoretical 
foundations.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Hintergrund: Aufgrund der demographischen 
Veränderungen mit einer höheren Lebenserwartung, der späteren Familiengründung 
und der steigenden Berufstätigkeit von Frauen werden Personen im mittleren 
Lebensalter zunehmend mit Sorgeerfordernissen der jüngeren und älteren 
Generation konfrontiert, die sie mit einer Erwerbstätigkeit vereinbaren. Ziel: 
Ziel ist es, einen Überblick über den Erkenntnisstand zu berufstätigen Personen 
mit gleichzeitiger Erziehungsverantwortung für minderjährige Kinder und 
Pflegeverantwortung für pflegebedürftige Angehörige zu geben. Methoden: Die 
Datenbanken MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, GeroLit, CC Med, SOWIPORT Gesis, 
PsycINFO und BASE wurden ohne zeitliche Eingrenzung nach deutsch- und 
englischsprachigen Studien durchsucht, die unabhängig vom Studiendesign in das 
Scoping Review aufgenommen wurden. Ergebnisse: Eingeschlossen wurden 85 Studien, 
die in westlichen Ländern durchgeführt wurden. Die Forschungsaktivitäten 
konzentrieren sich auf Nordamerika, während Befunde aus dem deutschsprachigen 
Raum nur in begrenztem Umfang vorliegen. Fast 70 % der Studien folgen einem 
quantitativen Studiendesign. Es werden Fragestellungen zu den Auswirkungen der 
multiplen Rollenübernahme sowie zur Vereinbarkeit der unterschiedlichen 
Lebensbereiche untersucht und überwiegend rollentheoretische Bezugsrahmen 
verwendet. Schlussfolgerungen: In der Übersicht zeigt sich, dass die Thematik im 
deutschsprachigen Raum bislang wenig beachtet wurde. Die methodischen 
Limitierungen und die mangelnde theoretische Differenziertheit der Studien 
führten zu teilweise widersprüchlichen Ergebnissen. Zukünftige Forschung sollte 
deshalb die Komplexität dieser Lebenssituation im methodischen Vorgehen und in 
der theoretischen Fundierung berücksichtigen.

BACKGROUND: The co-occurrence of two or more medical conditions in the same 
individual is not uncommon. If disability-adjusted life year (DALY) calculations 
are carried out for each condition separately, multimorbidity may lead to an 
overestimation of the morbidity component, the Years Lived with Disability 
(YLD). Adjusting for comorbidity may be straightforward if all symptoms have 
same onset and duration; however, when the comorbid health states occur at 
different time points, an analytical solution to the comorbidity problem becomes 
more complex. The aim of this study was to develop an individual-based modelling 
(IBM) approach to adjust incidence-based disease burden estimation for 
multimorbidity that allows simulating hypothetical individuals and tracking 
their disease history, including possible comorbidities, over time.
METHODS: We demonstrated the IBM approach using an example of external 
comorbidity, i.e., colon cancer comorbid with healthcare-associated pneumonia 
(HAP) and by assuming an independent multiplicative model. First, each 
cumulative progression probabilities were converted to a daily transition 
probabilities. Second, disability weights for simultaneously experienced health 
states and duration in each health state were determined. Third, YLD, adjusted 
for comorbidity, was calculated at every time step. We simulated a cohort of 
1000 colorectal cancer patients aged 65 years. Ninety-five percent uncertainty 
intervals around median YLD values were estimated by Monte Carlo methods.
RESULTS: The median estimated YLD per 1000 cases (due to both cancer and HAP) 
adjusted for co-morbidity was 545 YLD/1000 (95% interval: 513-585). The impact 
of not adjusting disability weights for co-existent health states varied from 
minimal to small; YLD for colorectal cancer would be overestimated only slightly 
- by 1.6 YLD/1000 - by not adjusting for concurrent HAP. YLD for those HAP 
patients who have concurrent early-stage colorectal cancer would be 
overestimated by 2.3 YLD/1000.
CONCLUSIONS: The computation of disease burden in the presence of multimorbidity 
using the incidence-based DALY approach can be handled through IBM. Our approach 
can be extended to other, more complicated multimorbidity scenarios which are 
responsible for a high current global disease burden, such as tuberculosis and 
HIV infection.

BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDOH) contribute to unequal life 
expectancy (LE). Only a handful of papers have analyzed these relationships at 
the neighborhood level as opposed to the county level. This study draws on both 
the SDOH and social vulnerability literature to identify relevant factors 
affecting LE.
METHODS: LE was calculated from mortality records for Florida from 2009 to 2013 
for 3640 census tracts with reliable estimates. A spatial Durbin error model 
(SDEM) quantified the direction and magnitude of the factors to LE. The SDEM 
contains a spatial error term and jointly estimates both local and neighborhood 
associations. This methodology controls for non-independence between census 
tracts to provide unbiased statistical estimates.
RESULTS: Factors significantly related to an increase in LE, include percentage 
(%) of the population who identify as Hispanic (beta coefficient [β]: 0.06, 
p-value [P] < 0.001) and % of age dependent populations (% population < 5 years 
old and % population > 65) (β: 0.13, P < 0.001). Conversely, the following 
factors exhibited significant negative LE associations, % of households with no 
automobile (β: -0.05, P < 0.001), % of mobile homes (β: -0.02, P < 0.001), and % 
of female headed households (β: -0.11, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Results from the SDEM demonstrate social vulnerability indicators 
account for additional geographic LE variability beyond commonly studied SDOH. 
Empirical findings from this analysis can help local health departments identify 
drivers of spatial health disparities at the local level.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate trends of mortality and the 
number of years of life lost due to lung cancer in Poland, in the period 
2000-2016.
METHODS: The study material was 375,151 death certificates of all inhabitants of 
Poland who died in the period 2000-2016 due to lung cancer. In order to 
calculate the number of years of life lost, the authors used indices: SEYLLp 
(Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person), SEYLLd (per deaths), 
APC (Annual Percentage Change) and AAPC (Average Annual Percentage Change).
RESULTS: The standardized death rate (SDR) due to lung cancer decreased in the 
analyzed period from 74.5 to 68.3 per 100,000 population (AAPC = -0.6%). The 
most rapid decrease was noted in the years 2008-2011 (APC = -2.2%). With regards 
to males, SDR decreased from 148.8 to 114.5 (AAPC = -1.7%), whereas in females, 
it increased from 25.7 to 37.6 (AAPC = 2.3%). The SEYLLp index, calculated per 
100,000 inhabitants, increased from 1189.9 in the year 2000 to 1250.5 in the 
year 2016. The trend and pace of changes fluctuated. In 2000-2008, the SEYLLp 
index was increasing at a pace of 0.7%. This growth was followed by a decrease 
at a pace of -1.2%, noted in 2008-2011. After the year 2011, the indices started 
to grow at an annual pace of 0.4%. AAPC in the whole study period was 0.3%. 
Increased mortality in females was responsible for the increase in the number of 
lost years of life. SEYLLp values in this sex group increased from 464.8 in the 
year 2000 to 774.7 in the year 2016 (APC = 3.3%).With regards to males, SEYLLp 
values, calculated for 100,000 male population, decreased in the analyzed period 
from 1961.1 to 1758.3.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer still poses a serious epidemiological problem in Poland 
and the number of years of life lost due to this cause reflects social and 
economic implications of premature lung cancer-related mortality. There is a 
great need to educate, particularly women, and show effective ways of quitting 
smoking.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are effective in reducing 
cardiovascular mortality and readmissions. However, most patients are denied the 
benefits of CR due to low referral rates. Of those patients referred, 
commencement rates vary from 28.4% to 60%. This paper quantifies the scale of 
health loss in Australia due to poor engagement with the program, and estimates 
how much public funding can be justifiably reallocated to address the problem.
METHODS: Economic decision modelling was undertaken to estimate the expected 
lifetime health loss and costs to Medicare. Key parameters were derived from 
Australian databases, CR registries and meta-analyses. Population health gains 
associated with uptake rates of 60%, and 85% were calculated.
RESULTS: CR was associated with a 99.9% probability of being cost-effective, 
even at a cost-effectiveness threshold lower than conventionally applied. 
Importantly, an average of 0.52 years of life expectancy are lost due to 
national uptake being below 60% achieved in some best performing programs in 
Australia, equivalent to 0.28 quality adjusted life years. The analysis 
indicates that $12.9 million/year could be justifiably reallocated from public 
funds to achieve a national uptake rate of 60%, while maintaining 
cost-effectiveness of CR due to the large health gains that would be expected.
CONCLUSION: CR is a cost-effective service for patients with coronary heart 
disease. In Australia, less than a third of patients commence CR, potentially 
resulting in avoidable patient harm. Additional investment in CR is vital and 
should be a national priority as the health gains for patients far outweigh the 
costs.

BACKGROUND: Few existing studies on the global incidence, prevalence, and burden 
of disease from psoriasis are of high quality, making reliable data and 
comparisons difficult to find.
METHODS: We analyzed global psoriasis trends from 1990 to 2017 in 195 countries 
worldwide through the Global Burden of Disease Study database, including 
age-standardized prevalence rates, percent change in age-standardized prevalence 
rates, age and sex patterns, and psoriasis burden using disability-adjusted life 
years.
RESULTS: The age-specific prevalence rate in 2017 showed a left-skewed 
distribution with a peak between 60 and 70 years of age and a roughly equal 
male-to-female ratio across all ages. Psoriasis burden was greatest in countries 
with high income and high sociodemographic index. A positive linear relationship 
between psoriasis prevalence and comorbidities is seen with cardiovascular 
disease (R = .67), mental health (R = .63), type 2 diabetes mellitus (R = .55), 
stroke (R = .51), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R = .84), Hodgkin lymphoma (R = .77), 
nonmelanoma skin cancer (R = .68), and inflammatory bowel disease (R = .55) 
across all countries in 2017.
CONCLUSION: There is increasing prevalence, burden, and associated comorbidities 
of psoriasis on a global scale and the need for support to reduce this important 
global health disparity.

OBJECTIVES: Other than age, diabetes is the largest contributor to overall 
healthcare costs and reduced life expectancy in Europe. This paper aims to more 
exactly quantify the net impact of diabetes on different aspects of healthcare 
provision in hospitals in England, building on previous work that looked at the 
determinants of outcome in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
SETTING: NHS Digital Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) in England was combined 
with the National Diabetes Audit (NDA) to provide the total number in practice 
of people with T1DM/T2DM.
OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared differences between T1DM/T2DM and non-diabetes 
individuals in relation to hospital activity and associated cost.
RESULTS: The study captured 90% of hospital activity and £36 billion/year of 
hospital spend. The NDA Register showed that out of a total reported population 
of 58 million, 2.9 million (6.5%) had T2DM and 240 000 (0.6%) had T1DM. Bed-day 
analysis showed 17% of beds are occupied by T2DM and 3% by T1DM. The overall 
cost of hospital care for people with diabetes is £5.5 billion/year. Once the 
normally expected costs including the older age of T2DM hospital attenders are 
allowed for this fell to £3.0 billion/year or 8% of the total captured secondary 
care costs. This equates to £560/non-diabetes person compared with £3280/person 
with T1DM and £1686/person with T2DM. For people with diabetes, the net excess 
impact on non-elective/emergency work is £1.2 billion with additional estimated 
diabetes-related accident & emergency attendances at 440 000 costing the NHS 
£70 million/year. T1DM individuals required five times more secondary care 
support than non-diabetes individuals. T2DM individuals, even allowing for the 
age, require twice as much support as non-diabetes individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that additional cost of provision of hospital 
services due to their diabetes comorbidities is £3 billion above that for 
non-diabetes, and that within this, T1DM has three times as much cost impact as 
T2DM. We suggest that supporting patients in diabetes management may 
significantly reduce hospital activity.

THE INTERGENERATIONAL STABILITY OF PUNISHMENT: PATERNAL INCARCERATION AND 
SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

Jacobsen WC(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Maryland.

OBJECTIVES: I extend the life-course theory of cumulative disadvantage to focus 
on continuity in punishment across generations. Specifically, I examine (1) the 
association between paternal incarceration and elementary school suspension or 
expulsion and (2) the extent to which behavior problems and weakened social 
bonds explain this association.
METHODS: Analyses rely on logistic regression, propensity score matching, and 
mediation methods with data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study 
(N=3,201), a birth-cohort of children born in large United States cities between 
1998 and 2000.
RESULTS: The odds of school punishment among children who had a residential 
father incarcerated by age five are 75% greater than the odds for children in a 
matched control group. About one-third of this association is accounted for by 
behavior problems and weakened social bonds. Even after accounting for behavior 
problems and social bonds, children whose father was incarcerated are at greater 
risk of school punishment.
CONCLUSIONS: I find evidence of an intergenerational stability of punishment and 
mixed support for an intergenerational extension to cumulative disadvantage 
theory. Paternal incarceration is associated with children's likelihood of 
experiencing formal punishment in elementary school, and behavior problems and 
weakened social bonds explain part of this association.

A continuous rise in life expectancy has led to an increase in the number of 
senior citizens, now amounting to a fifth of the global population, and to a 
dramatic increase in the prevalence of diseases of the elderly. This review 
discusses the threat of dementia, a disease that imposes enormous financial 
burden on health systems and warrants efficient therapeutic solutions. What we 
learned from numerous failed clinical trials is that we have to immediately take 
into account two major elements: early detection of dementia, much before the 
onset of symptoms, and personalized (precision) medicine treatment approach. We 
also discuss some of the most promising therapeutic directions, including stem 
cells, exosomes, electromagnetic fields, and ozone.

[Development of a new assessment for cardio-oncology and its international 
trend].

[Article in Japanese]

Cardiac safety assessments play a key role in drug development. New non-clinical 
cardiac safety risk assessments, such as the use of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, 
have been validated by several consortiums both in Japan and abroad. The 
emerging multidisciplinary field of cardio-oncology has been recognized more 
important. The success of new cancer therapies has improved life expectancy of 
cancer patients, hence more attention has been paid to cardiotoxicities 
associated with existing and new anti-cancer therapies, such as cardiomyocyte 
injury and heart failure, vascular injury and hypertension or thrombosis, which 
accelerated coronary artery disease. In addition to the well-studied 
proarrhythmia risk, some cardiotoxicities, such as contractility impairment, are 
expected to be evaluated by iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Here we developed a 
novel imaging-based in vitro contractility assay using iPSC-derived 
cardiomyocytes. In the review, we would like to discuss the current status and 
future perspectives in the assessment of cardiac contractile function by 
anti-cancer agents.

BACKGROUND: Heart transplantation (HT) success rate is limited by a high 
incidence of cancer post-HT. Data on kidney cancer following solid organ 
transplantation, especially HT, are limited, and only a few cases have been 
reported.
OBJECTIVES: To report a unique case series of detected kidney cancer following 
HT.
METHODS: Between 1997 and 2018, 265 patients who underwent HT were enrolled and 
prospectively followed in the HT registry of the Sheba Medical Center.
RESULTS: The series included 5 patients, 4 men and a woman (age range 35-50 
years at HT). The patients were diagnosed with kidney tumors 6-11 years after HT 
(age range at diagnosis 40-72 years). Two of the men were identical twin 
brothers. At HT four patients received induction therapy with anti-thymocyte 
globulin and all received an initial immunosuppressive regimen based on 
cyclosporine. All male HT recipients had a history of heavy smoking. Two male 
patients developed allograft vasculopathy, but all had preserved heart function. 
The 72-year-old woman developed a kidney tumor of the native kidney 5 years 
after re-HT and kidney transplantation. Two patients had features of multifocal 
papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and eventually underwent bilateral 
nephrectomy, while another patient underwent left partial nephrectomy with 
preserved renal function.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case series study 
describing kidney tumors following HT. With the improving outcomes and life 
expectancy of HT patients, a better understanding of the factors that determine 
cancer risk is of the utmost importance and may have a major impact on the 
non-cardiac surveillance.

Western societies, globalization, and the weakening of social expectations 
regarding the timing of developmental goals lead to a compression of the time 
for pursuing highly demanding developmental goals related to work and family in 
late young and middle adulthood. The expectation of longevity might lead adults 
to construct a "bucket list," postponing important leisure and social goals to 
the postretirement phase. Jointly, the weakening of age-related social 
expectations and the long postretirement phase in Western societies might result 
in a stronger segregation of the life course: education in "emerging adulthood," 
work and family in later young and middle adulthood, leisure and social goals in 
later adulthood. This segregation also conforms to a Western cultural script 
following the Protestant work ethic of delaying gratification by pursuing 
obligatory goals first (work, family) and only then turn to "play" after 
retirement (leisure, social goals), a time with relatively few obligations and 
social expectations. The segmentation of the life course has implications for 
self-regulatory demands, such that the importance of goal selection increases in 
emerging adulthood, the importance of managing multiple goals in late young and 
middle adulthood, and the importance of self-regulation for the pursuit of 
ill-defined goals in old age. Taken together, historical changes in the 
increased life expectancy in Western countries and weakened age-related 
expectations represent a challenge and an opportunity for developmental 
regulation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

The fusion of mammalian inner mitochondrial membranes (IMMs) is mediated by 
dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. Mutations in human OPA1 cause optic atrophy, but the 
molecular basis for membrane fusion and pathogenesis is not clear. Here, we 
determined the crystal structure of the minimal GTPase domain (MGD) of human 
OPA1. A three-helix bundle (HB) domain including two helices extending from the 
GTPase (G) domain and the last helix of OPA1 tightly associates with the G 
domain. In the presence of GDP and BeF3-, OPA1-MGD forms a dimer, the interface 
of which is critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. The 
catalytic core of OPA1 possesses unique features that are not present in other 
dynamin-like proteins. Biochemical experiments revealed that OPA1-MGD forms 
nucleotide-dependent dimers, which is important for membrane-stimulated GTP 
hydrolysis, and an N-terminal extension mediates nucleotide-independent 
dimerization that facilitates efficient membrane association. Our results 
suggest a multifaceted assembly of OPA1 and explain the effect of most OPA1 
mutations on optic atrophy.

Background: Chronic pain secondary to treatment in cancer survivors without 
tumor evidence is not unusual. Its management often requires specific approaches 
that are different from those applied for cancer patients with advanced disease 
and short life expectancy. Some studies have described clinical benefit with 
ozone therapy (O3T) in the management of pain and side effects secondary to 
cancer treatment. Objective: We present our preliminary experience with O3T in 
the management of refractory pelvic pain syndromes secondary to cancer 
treatment. Design: Case series. Subjects and Methods: Six cancer patients 
(without tumor evidence) who had been treated previously with radiotherapy, 
chemotherapy, or endoscopic procedures and were suffering persistent or severe 
pelvic pain (median 14 months) received O3T using ozone-oxygen gas mixture 
insufflation as a complementary therapy in addition to their scheduled 
conventional treatment. Results: All cases, except one, showed clinically 
relevant pain improvement. Visual analog scale score with the standard treatment 
was 7.8 ± 2.1 before O3T, 4.3 ± 3.4 (p = 0.049) after one month, 3.3 ± 3.7 
(p = 0.024) after two months, and 2.8 ± 3.8 (p = 0.020) after three months of 
O3T. The median value of "pain symptom" according to the U.S. National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v. 5.0 showed a 
decrease from 3 (range: 2-3) to 1 (range: 0-3) (p = 0.046). Conclusions: 
Following unsuccessful conventional treatments, O3T provided significant benefit 
in our patients with refractory pelvic pain secondary to cancer treatment. These 
results merit further evaluation in blinded, randomized clinical trials.

AIMS: To evaluate the clinical and cost impacts of the All New Zealand Acute 
Coronary Syndrome Quality Improvement programme (ANZACS-QI) specifically for 
Māori with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
METHODS: Decision analytic Markov models were used to estimate the effectiveness 
and costs of the ANZACS-QI programme over four years of full coverage (2013 to 
2016), against a hypothetical scenario in which the registry did not exist. The 
estimated return on investment (ROI) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) are reported.
RESULTS: The ROI ratio for the ANZACS-QI programme for Māori over the four-year 
period of full coverage was 1.51; that is, every dollar spent on the programme 
resulted in a return of NZD $1.51. The estimated ICER was NZD $114,786 per year 
of life saved (YoLS) over a one-year time horizon, but extending the benefits 
accrued to five years reduced the ICER to NZD $20,173 per YoLS.
CONCLUSIONS: The ANZACS-QI programme represents a sound investment for improving 
outcomes in the setting of ACS for Māori in New Zealand. Using highly 
conservative assumptions, the programme would be cost-saving based on an annual 
ROI ratio of 1.5.

AIM: That clinical trial (RAINBOW) showed that a 7.4 months overall survival 
benefit with the combination therapy with ramucirumab (RAM) and paclitaxel (PAC) 
as second-line therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, compared with placebo (PLA) plus 
paclitaxel. We performed an analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of RAM 
from a Chinese perspective and recognized the range of drug costs.
METHODS: By building a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), life-years (LYs) and lifetime costs. Transition probabilities, costs 
and utilities were estimated for the published literature, Chinese health care 
system and local price setting. We performed threshold analyses and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the uncertainty of the model.
RESULTS: Compared with PLA strategy, RAM strategy provided an incremental 
survival benefit of 1.22 LYs and 0.64 QALYs. The probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed that when RAM costs less than $151 or $753 per 4 weeks, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) approximated the willingness-to-pay 
threshold (WTP), suggesting that there was 50% likelihood that the ICER for RAM 
+ PAC would be less than $44528.4 per QALY or $48121 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma who fail first-line chemotherapy, our results are conducive to 
the multilateral drug price guidance negotiations of RAM in China.

BACKGROUND: In China, the disease burden of cervical cancer remains substantial. 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are expensive and not yet centrally funded. 
To inform immunization policy, understanding the economic burden of the disease 
is necessary. This study adopted a societal perspective and investigated costs 
and quality of life changes associated with cervical cancer from diagnosis to 
one year after final discharge in Henan province, China.
METHODS: Inpatient records of cervical cancer patients admitted to the largest 
cancer hospital in Henan province between Jan. 2017 and Dec. 2018 were 
extracted. A telephone interview with four modules was conducted in Jun.-Jul. 
2019 with a 40% random draw of patients to obtain direct non-medical costs and 
indirect costs associated with inpatients, costs associated with outpatient 
visits, and changes in quality of life status using the EQ-5D-5L instrument. 
Direct medical expenditures were converted to opportunity costs of care using 
cost-to-charge ratios obtained from hospital financial reports. For each 
clinical stage (IA-IV), total costs per case from diagnosis to one year after 
final discharge were extrapolated based on inpatient records, responses to the 
telephone interview, and recommendation on outpatient follow-ups by Chinese 
cervical cancer treatment guidelines. Loss in quality-adjusted life years was 
obtained using the 'under the curve' method and regression predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 3,506 inpatient records from 1,323 patients were obtained. 
Among 541 randomly selected patients, 309 completed at least one module of the 
telephone interview. The average total costs per case associated with cervical 
cancer from diagnosis to one year after final discharge ranged from 
$8,066-$22,888 (in 2018 US Dollar) and the quality-adjusted life years loss 
varied from 0.05-0.26 for IA-IV patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden associated with cervical cancer is substantial 
in Henan province. Our study provided important baseline information for 
cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV immunization program in China.

Hematologist and transplant physicians: How and where to meet for the best of 
sickle cell disease patients?

Paris, Paris, France. Electronic address: jean-hugues.dalle@aphp.fr.

Despite huge progress in the fields of newborn screening, encapsulated bacterial 
infection prophylaxis, immunization, and supportive care in general, people 
suffering from sickle cell anemia still continue to have a shorter life 
expectancy and a poorer quality of life due to painful vaso-occlusive events and 
strokes during childhood, and later, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal injuries, 
including in Western and high-income countries. From the 2000s, allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation for severe sickle cell disease from a sibling donor 
provided the best results-overall as well as disease-free survival-never 
obtained for any other disease. Nevertheless, this only curative option is 
proposed to few patient numbers, including in Western countries with high-level 
medical equipment development, with discrepancies between (i) patients and 
family, (ii) physicians and care centers dedicated to sickle cell disease, and 
(iii) hematopoietic stem cell transplant teams. Due to these discrepancies and 
in order to provide the same quality of discussion and treatment choice for 
every sickle cell disease patient, we developed a National French 
multidisciplinary pluri-annual meeting dedicated to sickle cell disease patients 
and transplantation. We report here our experience of such a meeting.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the magnitude of interactions in costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and net benefits within a sample of 
published economic evaluations of factorial randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 
evaluate the impact that different analytical methods would have had on the 
results and compare the performance of different criteria for identifying which 
interactions should be taken into account.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of full economic evaluations conducted 
alongside factorial RCTs and reviewed the methods used in different studies, as 
well as the incidence, magnitude, statistical significance, and type of 
interactions observed within the trials. We developed the interaction-effect 
ratio as a measure of the magnitude of interactions relative to main effects. 
For those studies reporting sufficient data, we assessed whether changing the 
form of analysis to ignore or include interactions would have changed the 
conclusions. We evaluated how well different criteria for identifying which 
interactions should be taken into account in the analysis would perform in 
practice, using simulated data generated to match the summary statistics of the 
studies identified in the review.
RESULTS: Large interactions for economic endpoints occurred frequently within 
the 40 studies identified in the review, although interactions rarely changed 
the conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulation work demonstrated that in analyses of factorial RCTs, 
taking account of all interactions or including interactions above a certain 
size (regardless of statistical significance) minimised the opportunity cost 
from adopting treatments that do not in fact have the highest true net benefit.

BACKGROUND: Studies of progression of kidney dysfunction typically focus on 
renal replacement therapy or percentage decline in estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) as outcomes. Our aim was to compare real-world patients 
with and without T2D to estimate progression from and to clinically defined 
categories of kidney disease and all-cause mortality.
METHODS: This was an observational cohort study of 31,931 patients with and 
33,201 age/sex matched patients without type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had a serum 
creatinine and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) or dipstick proteinuria 
(DP) values. We used the first available serum creatinine value between 2006 and 
2012 to calculate baseline eGFR and categorized them and the corresponding 
UACR/DP values using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 
categories. To assess our primary outcomes, we extracted probabilities of eGFR 
progression or mortality from life-table analyses and conducted multivariable 
Cox regression analyses of relative risk adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
smoking, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and use of 
renal-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.
RESULTS: Patterns of eGFR decline were comparable among patients with vs. 
without T2D with larger percentage declines at higher albuminuria levels across 
all eGFR categories. eGFR decline was generally larger among T2D patients, 
particularly in those with severely increased albuminuria. Across all CKD 
categories, risk of progression to the next higher category of eGFR was 
substantially increased with increasing albuminuria. For example, the risk was 
23.5, 36.2, and 65.1% among T2D patients with eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2 and UACR 
< 30, 30-299, and > 300 mg/dL, respectively (p < 0.001). Other comparisons were 
similarly significant. Among patients with low eGFR and normal to mildly 
increased albuminuria, the relative risk was up to 8-fold greater for all-cause 
mortality compared with the non-CKD subgroup (eGFR> 60 ml/min/1.73m2 with normal 
to mildly increased albuminuria).
CONCLUSIONS: Presence of albuminuria was associated with accelerated eGFR 
decline independent of T2D. Risk for adverse outcomes was remarkably high among 
patients with CKD and normal to mildly increased albuminuria levels. Independent 
of T2D or albuminuria, a substantial risk for adverse outcomes exists for CKD 
patients in a routine care setting.

BACKGROUND: Head and Neck cancer (HNC) is characterized by significant mortality 
and morbidity. Treatment is often invasive and interferes with vital functions, 
resulting in a delicate balance between survival benefit and deterioration in 
quality of life (QoL). Therefore, including prognostic information during 
patient counseling can be of great importance. The first aim of this study was 
to explore HNC patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information: both 
qualitative (general terms like "curable cancer"), and quantitative information 
(numbers, percentages). The second aim of this study was to explore patients' 
views on "OncologIQ", a prognostic model developed to estimate overall survival 
in newly diagnosed HNC patients.
METHODS: We conducted a single center qualitative study by organizing five focus 
groups with HNC patients (n = 21) and their caregivers (n = 19), categorized in: 
1) small laryngeal carcinomas treated with radiotherapy or laser, 2) extensive 
oral cavity procedures, 3) total laryngectomy, 4) chemoradiation, 5) other 
treatments. The patients' perspective was the main focus. The interview guide 
consisted of two main topics: life-expectancy and the prognostic model 
OncologIQ. All focus groups were recorded, transcribed and coded. Themes were 
derived using content analysis.
RESULTS: While all patients considered it somewhat to very important to receive 
information about their life-expectancy, only some of them wanted to receive 
quantitative information. Disclosing qualitative prognostic information like 
"the cancer is curable" would give enough reassurance for most patients. 
Overall, patients thought life-expectancy should not be discussed shortly after 
cancer diagnosis disclosure, as a certain time is needed to process the first 
shock. They had a stronger preference for receiving prognostic information in 
case of a poor prognosis. Prognostic information should also include information 
on the expected QoL. The pie chart was the most preferred chart for discussing 
survival rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The participants found it important to receive information on their 
life-expectancy. While most patients were enough reassured by qualitative 
prognostic information, some wanted to receive quantitative information like 
OncologIQs' estimates. A tailor-made approach is necessary to provide customized 
prognostic information. A clinical practice guideline was developed to support 
professionals in sharing prognostic information, aiming to improve shared 
decision making and patient-centered care.
