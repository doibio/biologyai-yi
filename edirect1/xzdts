BACKGROUND: Updated information on the burden of Alzheimer's disease and other 
forms of dementia are of great importance for evidence-based health care 
planning. However, such an estimate has been lacking in Chinese populations at 
both national and provincial levels.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the temporal trends and the attributable burdens of 
selected risk factors of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia in 
China.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is an observational description of the 
Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 (GBD 2019). Data on incidence, mortality, 
prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability 
(YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of 
dementia were derived from the GBD 2019 study at both national and provincial 
levels in China.
MEASUREMENTS: Six indicators were used: incidence, mortality, prevalence, DALYs, 
YLLs, and YLDs. Absolute numbers in detail by age, sex, region, and 
age-standardized rates (with 95% uncertainty intervals) were calculated.
RESULTS: There were notable increasing trends in the number of deaths (247·9%), 
incidence (264·8%), prevalence (296·5%), DALYs (228·1%), YLDs (308·7%) and YLLs 
(201·7%) from 1990 to 2019, respectively. The corresponding age-standardized 
rates increased by 6·2%, 19·3%, 33·6%, 10·7%, 33·4% and 3·1%. Smoking, high body 
mass index, high fasting plasma glucose levels, and metabolic risks were the 
four leading risk factors. Higher burden was observed among females versus males 
and in the more developed regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden in China were increasing substantially. Regional 
differences of the disease burden are accompanied by discrepancies of economic 
level and geographical location, as well as different levels of exposure to risk 
factors. Targeted prevention and control strategies are urgently needed to 
reduce the disease burden.

Suction feeding in ray-finned fishes involves powerful buccal cavity expansion 
to accelerate water and food into the mouth. Previous XROMM studies in 
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) 
and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) have shown that more than 90% of 
suction power in high performance strikes comes from the axial musculature. 
Thus, the shape of the axial muscles and skeleton may affect suction feeding 
mechanics. Royal knifefish (Chitala blanci) have an unusual postcranial 
morphology, with a ventrally flexed vertebral column and relatively large mass 
of epaxial muscle. Based on their body shape, we hypothesized that royal 
knifefish would generate high power strikes by utilizing large neurocranial 
elevation, vertebral column extension and epaxial shortening. As predicted, C. 
blanci generated high suction expansion power compared with the other three 
species studied to date (up to 160 W), which was achieved by increasing both the 
rate of volume change and the intraoral subambient pressure. The large epaxial 
muscle (25% of body mass) shortened at high velocities to produce large 
neurocranial elevation and vertebral extension (up to 41 deg, combined), as well 
as high muscle mass-specific power (up to 800 W kg-1). For the highest power 
strikes, axial muscles generated 95% of the power, and 64% of the axial muscle 
mass consisted of the epaxial muscles. The epaxial-dominated suction expansion 
of royal knifefish supports our hypothesis that postcranial morphology may be a 
strong predictor of suction feeding biomechanics.

Comment in
    Age Ageing. 2022 Jun 1;51(6):

OBJECTIVE: this study explored whether the modification of selected lifestyles 
is likely to increase life expectancy from middle age onwards, regardless of the 
presence of major comorbidities.
METHODS: we examined a prospective cohort of 20,373 men and 26,247 women aged 
40-80 years. Eight modifiable lifestyle factors were assessed: consumption of 
fruit, fish and milk, walking and/or sports participation, body-mass index, 
smoking status, alcohol consumption and sleep duration. Modifiable healthy 
lifestyle factors scored one point each, for a maximum of eight points. The 
impact of modifiable healthy lifestyle adoption on lifetime gain during the ages 
of 40-102 years was analysed.
FINDINGS: during the median 21 years of follow-up, 8,966 individuals (3,683 men 
and 5,283 women) died. Life expectancy at 40 years (95% confidence intervals) 
for 7-8 health lifestyle points was 46.8 (45.6-48.1) and 51.3 (50.0-52.6) years 
for men and women, respectively. The potential impact of modifiable healthy 
lifestyle adoption on lifetime gain persisted over the age of 80 years or more, 
in individuals with ≥5 factors (P < 0.001), particularly older men. The benefits 
were more pronounced among patients with major comorbidities, such as 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease and those 
with multimorbidity throughout all age categories.
CONCLUSION: adopting modifiable healthy lifestyles was associated with lifetime 
gain, even in individuals aged 80 years or more, regardless of the presence of 
any major comorbidities in each life stage since middle age. The findings imply 
the importance of improving the one's lifestyle for an increased lifespan, even 
among older patients and/or those with multimorbidity.

To reveal the formation mechanism of fungal community and diversity during the 
production of Shaoxing Huangjiu, we examined fungal communities in the samples 
of Linfanjiumu, Maiqu and fermentation mash based on Illumina MiSeq PE300 
high-throughput sequencing platform. A total of 136000, 215283, 166150, and 
143624 sequences were obtained from the samples of Linfanjiumu, Maiqu, initial 
mash and mature mash, respectively. After clustering, 32, 133, 107 and 84 OUT 
(operational taxonomic units) were obtained, respectively. The diversity and 
richness of fungi were in order of Maiqu &gt; initial mash &gt; mature mash &gt; 
Linfanjiumu. At the level of phylum, Ascomycota were dominant in all samples. At 
genus level, Saccharomyces was dominant in Linfanjiumu, Aspergillus was dominant 
in Maiqu, and Saccharomyces and Aspergillus were the dominant fungi in the 
initial and mature mash. With the extension of the fermentation time, the 
proportion of Saccharomyces gradually increased in the mash, while other fungal 
groups including Aspergillus showed a decreasing trend. According to the results 
of PCoA analysis and similarity cluster analysis, the structure of fungi 
community in Linfanjiumu, initial mash and mature mash was much similar, while 
the fungal resources in Maiqu were quite different from other samples. The 
analysis of fungal community characteristics in the initial mash showed that the 
Linfanjiumu and Maiqu affected fungal diversity in Shaoxing Huangjiu. The 
dominant species of saccharification and fermentation starter (Linfanjiumu and 
Maiqu) played a leading role in driving community assembly of fermentation 
fungi.

In this study, to improve the quality and shelf life of hamburgers, sesame meal 
protein hydrolysates (SPH) were produced using two enzymes of alcalase and 
flavourzyme and then four hamburger treatments: T1: control (10% soybean), T2: 
1% SPH + soybean 9%, T3: 2% SPH + soybean 8%, and T4: 3% SPH + soybean 7% were 
prepared. Physicochemical properties were analyzed at the beginning of the 
storage period; microbial and chemical quality was evaluated at intervals of 0, 
4, 8, 12, and 16 days. The results of SPH showed that alcalase enzyme can 
produce a SPH with a higher antioxidant properties (DPPH, FRAP, and 
beta-carotene-linoleic acid) (P < 0.05); therefore, this SPH was used for 
hamburger properties. According to the results, with the addition of SPH, 
moisture, fat, texture firmness decreased, protein, and brightness increased 
(P < 0.05), and all treatments had the allowable range. SPH replacement with 
soybean slowed down the increasing trend of oxidation and microbial spoilage 
(P < 0.05). In general, better results were observed in T3 and T4, which had a 
permissible range chemical and microbial index until the end of the storage 
period, as well as these treatments inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus 
aureus and Escherichia coli. Only T3 was approved by the evaluators.

Suitable designed photoswitches based on azobenzenes are essential structural 
features for photopharmacological compounds. Optimized azobenzenes are important 
for serving as building blocks in "azo extension" strategies, and for designing 
photodrugs with tailored properties. Herein we present the synthesis and 
characterization of a variety of asymmetric azobenzenes by addressing selected 
structural features of the diazene core, such as polarity, steric demand, and 
electronic properties. Systematic exploration led to photoswitches with a 
relaxation half-life of seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Furthermore, the 
influence of different substitution patterns on the photophysical properties was 
charted. For analysis of all switches, robust characterization as well as 
examination under near-to physiological conditions was established, in order to 
assist with photoswitch choice for specific biological applications.

PURPOSE: Social disconnection, such as loneliness, is recognized as a 
significant public health concern in the United States, and young adult males 
may carry the greater burden of this issue when compared with their female 
peers. Little is known about the correlates of loneliness for this population. 
This study examines the social-ecological correlates of loneliness in young 
adult males.
METHODS: Males, aged 18 to 25 years, in the United States were recruited to take 
part in a cross-sectional electronic survey. Loneliness was assessed as a 
composite measure. The social-ecological correlates consisted of 
intrapersonal-level (e.g., social-demographic characteristics), 
interpersonal-level (e.g., adverse childhood experiences), community-level 
(e.g., life expectancy at the county level), and societal-level (e.g., idealized 
masculine gender) variables. A four-block hierarchical regression was performed 
with each block representing the respective social-ecological level.
RESULTS: Among the study sample (n = 495), the intra- and interpersonal 
variables significantly shared 10% and an incremental 3%, respectively, of the 
explained variance in loneliness. Mental health diagnosis (β = 1.06, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: [0.54, 1.59]), childhood physical and emotional abuse 
(β = 0.21, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.39]), and childhood sexual abuse (β = 0.30, 95% CI: 
[0.01, 0.60]) were significantly associated with greater loneliness.
CONCLUSION: The findings highlight that the micro-level (intra- and 
interpersonal) correlates may be most important in predicting loneliness in 
young adult males. Specifically, young males with a mental health diagnosis and 
those with greater experiences of childhood adversity are at potentially greater 
risk for loneliness. Implications for research, programming, and policy are 
highlighted.

Therapeutic advances have resulted in increased life expectancy in patients with 
hemophilia. Consequently, the prevalence of coronary artery disease in this 
population is increasing. Little is known about the optimal management of acute 
coronary syndrome in these patients. Current guidelines for the management of 
this condition are based mainly on expert opinion and generally recommend 
administration of the clotting factor prior to the anticoagulant, antiplatelet, 
and interventional therapies. We report a case that illustrates the potential 
harm that may come from this approach: evolution of non-ST-segment elevation 
acute coronary syndrome into ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome during the 
administration of recombinant clotting factor. We review available literature 
and describe the refined informatics-based guidelines for managing acute 
coronary syndrome in patients with hemophilia we developed in response to the 
presented clinical case. We propose adopting this novel informatics-based 
approach, which aids in the identification and early treatment of these 
patients, operationalizes timely involvement of hematology experts, and gathers 
data for further study.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Aggressive pituitary adenomas (APAs) are pituitary 
tumors that are refractory to standard treatments and carry a poor prognosis. 
Current treatment guidelines are not standardized but combine surgical 
resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Temozolomide is the only 
chemotherapeutic agent with documented effectiveness and is recommended for APA 
in European Society of Endocrinology clinical guidelines.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man presented with visual deterioration and 
bitemporal hemianopsia. MRI of the brain demonstrated a sellar mass suspected to 
be pituitary macroadenoma with displacement of the stalk and optic nerve 
impingement. The patient underwent stereotactic endoscopic transsphenoidal 
resection of the mass. Postoperative MRI demonstrated gross total resection. 
Pathology revealed a sparsely granulated corticotroph adenoma with malignant 
transformation. Immunohistochemistry showed loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2 
in the tumor cells. Proton therapy was recommended given an elevated Ki67 index 
and p53 positivity. Before radiotherapy, there was no radiographic evidence of 
residual tumor. Temozolomide therapy was initiated after surveillance MRI showed 
recurrence at 16 months postoperatively. However, MRI demonstrated marked 
progression after 3 cycles. Next-generation sequencing using the MSK-IMPACT 
platform identified somatic mutations in MLH1 Y548lfs*9 and TP53 R337C . 
Immunotherapy with ipilimumab/nivolumab was initiated, and MRI demonstrated no 
residual tumor burden 34 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: APA is a tumor with frequent recurrence and a short median expected 
length of survival. Here, we demonstrate the utility of immunotherapy in a 
single case report of APA, with complete resolution of recurrent APA and 
improved survival compared with life expectancy.

Lysine 2,3-Aminomutase and a Newly Discovered Glutamate 2,3-Aminomutase Produce 
β-Amino Acids Involved in Salt Tolerance in Methanogenic Archaea.

Many methanogenic archaea synthesize β-amino acids as osmolytes that allow 
survival in high salinity environments. Here, we investigated the radical 
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) aminomutases involved in the biosynthesis of 
Nε-acetyl-β-lysine and β-glutamate in Methanococcus maripaludis C7. Lysine 
2,3-aminomutase (KAM), encoded by MmarC7_0106, was overexpressed and purified 
from Escherichia coli, followed by biochemical characterization. In the presence 
of l-lysine, SAM, and dithionite, this archaeal KAM had a kcat = 14.3 s-1 and a 
Km = 19.2 mM. The product was shown to be 3(S)-β-lysine, which is like the 
well-characterized Clostridium KAM as opposed to the E. coli KAM that produces 
3(R)-β-lysine. We further describe the function of MmarC7_1783, a putative 
radical SAM aminomutase with a ∼160 amino acid extension at its N-terminus. 
Bioinformatic analysis of the possible substrate-binding residues suggested a 
function as glutamate 2,3-aminomutase, which was confirmed here through 
heterologous expression in a methanogen followed by detection of β-glutamate in 
cell extracts. β-Glutamate has been known to serve as an osmolyte in select 
methanogens for a long time, but its biosynthetic origin remained unknown until 
now. Thus, this study defines the biosynthetic routes for β-lysine and 
β-glutamate in M. maripaludis and expands the importance and diversity of 
radical SAM enzymes in all domains of life.

Essential oils (EOs) or vegetable oils have become the focus of several studies 
because of their interesting bioactive properties. Their application has been 
successfully explored in active packaging, edible coatings, and as natural 
flavoring to extend the shelf life of various types of food products. In 
addition, alternative methods of extraction of EOs (ultrasound-assisted 
extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, pressurized liquid extraction and 
supercritical fluid extraction) have been shown to be more attractive than 
traditional methods since they present better efficiency, shorter extraction 
times and do not use toxic solvents. This review paper provides a concise and 
critical view of extraction methods of EOs and their application in food 
products. The researchers involved in the studies approached in this review were 
motivated mainly by concern about food quality. Here, we recognize and discuss 
the major advances and technologies recently used to enable shelf life extension 
of food products.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the dynapenia-free life expectancy among 
community-dwelling older Brazilian adults and evaluate gender-related and 
educational differences.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. The data were obtained from the Estudo 
Longitudinal da Saúde dos Idosos Brasileiros (ELSI-Brazil - Brazilian 
Longitudinal Study of Aging), conducted from 2015 to 2016 in Brazil. Dynapenia 
is defined as low muscle strength (< 27kg for men and < 16kg for women), 
measured with a handgrip dynamometer. The dynapenia-free life expectancy was 
estimated using the Sullivan method based on the standard period life table and 
dynapenia prevalence, stratified by age groups, gender, and schooling.
RESULTS: A total of 8,827 participants, aged 50 and over (53.3% women), were 
investigated. The prevalence of dynapenia was 17.7% among men and 18.5% among 
women. The women live longer and with more years free of dynapenia than men. 
Those in the higher education category (four or more years) presented an 
advantage in the dynapenia-free life expectancy estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the substantial impact of 
dynapenia on longer dynapenia-free life expectancy among older people. 
Understanding dynapenia prevalence and dynapenia-free life expectancy could 
assist in predicting care needs, as well as targeting efforts to delay the onset 
of complications related to it at older ages. Without the implementation of 
policy regarding dynapenia prevention, inequalities in health due to gender and 
socioeconomic status may continue to increase.

The growth in longevity in Brazil has drawn attention to more useful population 
health measures to complement mortality. In this paper, we investigate 
socio-spatial differences in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy based 
on information from the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS), 2013 and 2019. A 
three-stage cluster sampling with stratification of the primary sampling units 
and random selection in all stages was used in both PNS editions. Healthy life 
expectancy was estimated by Sullivan's method by sex, age, and Federated Units 
(UF). Severe limitations to at least one noncommunicable chronic disease (NCD) 
or poor self-rated health were used to define the unhealthy state. Inequality 
indicators and a Principal Component analysis were used to investigate 
socio-spatial inequalities. From 2013 to 2019, both life expectancy and healthy 
life expectancy increased. The analysis by UF show larger disparities in healthy 
life expectancy than in life expectancy, with healthy life expectancy at age 60 
varying from 13.6 to 19.9 years, in 2013, and from 14.9 to 20.1, in 2019. 
Healthy life expectancy in the wealthiest quintile was 20% longer than for those 
living in the poorest quintile. Wide socio-spatial disparities were found with 
the worst indicators in the UF located in the North and Northeast regions, 
whether considering poverty concentration or health care utilization. The 
socio-spatial inequalities demonstrated the excess burden of poor health 
experienced by older adults living in the less developed UF. The development of 
strategies at subnational levels is essential not only to provide equal access 
to health care but also to reduce risk exposures and support prevention policies 
for adoption of health behaviors.

Cancer is one of the major causes of death and a significant obstacle to 
increasing life expectancy worldwide. Chemotherapy remains the first-line 
adjuvant therapeutic option for all stages of cancer, and it can effectively 
improve patients' prognosis in the short term. However, its long-term effect on 
extending patient survival is limited due to the emergence of drug resistance. 
The mechanisms involved in drug resistance are complicated and still not fully 
understood. Forkhead box class O3a (FOXO3a) belongs to the FOXO subfamily of 
forkhead transcription factors. It plays a crucial role in many aspects of 
cancer progression and drug resistance. Recent studies have shown that FOXO3a 
dysregulation contributes to drug resistance development through various 
mechanisms, including modulating oncogenic signaling pathways, evading 
apoptosis, promoting excessive drug efflux, inducing autophagy, facilitating 
epithelial to mesenchymal transition, enhancing DNA damage repair, and altering 
the characteristics of cancer stem cells. FOXO3a also exhibits great potential 
as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker candidate and therapeutic target for 
cancer patients. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the roles and 
mechanisms of FOXO3a in cancer drug resistance and highlight its clinical 
implications as a biomarker and a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

Fragment crystallizable (Fc) fusion is commonly used for extending the half-life 
of biotherapeutics such as cytokines. In this work, we studied the 
pharmacokinetics of Fc-fused interleukin-10 (IL-10) proteins that exhibited 
potent antitumor activity in mouse syngeneic tumor models. At pharmacologically 
active doses of ≥0.1 mg/kg, both mouse Fc-mouse IL-10 and human Fc-human IL-10, 
constructed as the C terminus of the Fc domain fused with IL-10 via a 
glycine-serine polypeptide linker, exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics after 
intravenous administration to mice at the doses of 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/kg. With 
a nominal dose ratio of 1:10:100; the ratio of the area under the curve for 
mouse Fc-mouse IL-10 and human Fc-human IL-10 was 1:181:1830 and 1:75:633, 
respectively. In contrast, recombinant mouse or human IL-10 proteins exhibited 
linear pharmacokinetics in mice. Compartmental analysis, using the 
Michaelis-Menten equation with the in vitro IL-10 receptor alpha binding 
affinity inputted as the Km, unified the pharmacokinetic data across the dose 
range. Additionally, nontarget-mediated clearance estimated for fusion proteins 
was ∼200-fold slower than that for cytokines, causing the manifestation of 
target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) in the fusion protein pharmacokinetics. 
The experimental data generated with a mouse IL-10 receptor alpha-blocking 
antibody and a human Fc-human IL-10 mutant with a reduced receptor binding 
affinity showed significant improvements in pharmacokinetics, supporting TMDD as 
the cause of nonlinearity. Target expression and its effect on pharmacokinetics 
must be determined when considering using Fc as a half-life extension strategy, 
and pharmacokinetic evaluations need to be performed at a range of doses 
covering pharmacological activity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Target-mediated drug 
disposition can manifest to affect the pharmacokinetics of a fragment 
crystallizable (Fc)-fused cytokine when the nontarget-mediated clearance of the 
cytokine is decreased due to neonatal Fc receptor-mediated recycling and 
molecular weight increases that reduce the renal clearance. The phenomenon was 
demonstrated with interleukin-10 Fc-fusion proteins in mice at pharmacologically 
active doses. Future drug designs using Fc as a half-life extension approach for 
cytokines need to consider target expression and its effect on pharmacokinetics 
at relevant doses.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether locally acting ACE-083 is safe, well tolerated, 
and increases muscle volume, motor function, and quality of life (QoL) in adults 
with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 1.
METHODS: This phase 2 study enrolled adults with CMT1 or CMTX (N=63). Part 1 was 
open-label and evaluated safety and tolerability of different dose levels of 
ACE-083 for use in Part 2. Part 2 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month 
study of 240 mg/muscle ACE-083 injected bilaterally in the tibialis anterior 
muscle, followed by a 6-month, open-label extension in which all patients 
received ACE-083. Pharmacodynamic endpoints included total muscle volume (TMV; 
primary endpoint), contractile muscle volume (CMV), and fat fraction. Additional 
secondary endpoints included 6-minute walk test, 10-meter walk/run, muscle 
strength, and QoL. Safety was assessed with treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) and clinical laboratory tests.
RESULTS: In Part 1 (n=18), ACE-083 was generally safe and well tolerated at all 
dose levels, with no serious AEs, TEAEs ≥Grade 3, or death reported. In Part 2 
(n=45 enrolled, n=44 treated), there was significantly greater change in TMV 
with ACE-083 compared with placebo (LS mean difference: 13.5%; p = 0.0096). 
There was significant difference between ACE-083 and placebo for CMV and change 
in ankle dorsiflexion strength. Fat fraction and all other functional outcomes 
were not significantly improved by ACE-083. Moderate-to-mild injection-site 
reactions were the most common TEAEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite significantly increased TMV and CMV, patients with CMT 
receiving ACE-083 in tibialis anterior muscles did not demonstrate greater 
functional improvement compared with those receiving placebo.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that 
intramuscular ACE-083 is safe, well tolerated, and increases total muscle volume 
after 6 months of treatment in adults with CMT1 or CMTX.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The 
cancer burden varies within the regions of India posing great challenges in its 
prevention and control. The national burden assessment remains as a task which 
relies on statistical models in many developing countries, including India, due 
to cancer not being a notifiable disease. This study quantifies the cancer 
burden in India for 2016, adjusted mortality to incidence (AMI) ratio and 
projections for 2021 and 2025 from the National Cancer Registry Program (NCRP) 
and other publicly available data sources.
METHODS: Primary data on cancer incidence and mortality between 2012 and 2016 
from 28 Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs), all-cause mortality from 
Sample Registration Systems (SRS) 2012-16, lifetables and disability weight from 
World Health Organization (WHO), the population from Census of India and cancer 
prevalence using the WHO-DisMod-II tool were used for this study. The AMI ratio 
was estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method from longitudinal 
NCRP-PBCR data (2001-16). The burden was quantified at national and sub-national 
levels as crude incidence, mortality, Years of Life Lost (YLLs), Years Lived 
with Disability (YLDs) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The 
projections for the years 2021 and 2025 were done by the negative binomial 
regression model using STATA.
RESULTS: The projected cancer burden in India for 2021 was 26.7 million DALYsAMI 
and expected to increase to 29.8 million in 2025. The highest burden was in the 
north (2408 DALYsAMI per 100,000) and northeastern (2177 DALYsAMI per 100,000) 
regions of the country and higher among males. More than 40% of the total cancer 
burden was contributed by the seven leading cancer sites - lung (10.6%), breast 
(10.5%), oesophagus (5.8%), mouth (5.7%), stomach (5.2%), liver (4.6%), and 
cervix uteri (4.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the use of reliable data sources and 
DisMod-II tools that adhere to the international standard for assessment of 
national and sub-national cancer burden. A wide heterogeneity in leading cancer 
sites was observed within India by age and sex. The results also highlight the 
need to focus on non-leading sites of cancer by age and sex. These findings can 
guide policymakers to plan focused approaches towards monitoring efforts on 
cancer prevention and control. The study simplifies the methodology used for 
arriving at the burden estimates and thus, encourages researchers across the 
world to take up similar assessments with the available data.

The number of elderly patients initiating hemodialysis (HD) increased 
considerably over the past decade. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are the 
preferred vascular access (VA) type in most HD patients. Choice of VA for older 
hemodialysis patients presents a challenge. The higher incidence of 
comorbidities, longer AVF maturation times, risk of primary failure, risk of 
patency loss, and shorter life expectancy are important factors to consider. In 
this review we provide a comprehensive analysis on maturation rates, primary 
failure, patency, and mortality regarding vascular access in patients older than 
75 years of age.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify temporal changes in colonoscopy indication and assess 
appropriateness of surveillance use in older adults.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study of national Veterans Health 
Administration (VHA) data of all patients who underwent outpatient colonoscopy 
in 2005-2014.
METHODS: After validating an electronic algorithm for classifying colonoscopy 
indication in VHA, we examined trends in colonoscopy indication over time and 
across patient characteristics.
RESULTS: The proportion of colonoscopies performed for postpolypectomy 
surveillance increased significantly during the study period, particularly among 
older patients with limited life expectancy, raising concern for possible 
overuse.
CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines should make clear recommendations about when and how to 
discontinue postpolypectomy surveillance colonoscopy. Doing so would potentially 
reduce harms due to complications from low-value procedures and in turn moderate 
demand and thereby enhance overall procedural access for patients more likely to 
benefit.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity poses one of the biggest public health challenges 
globally. In addition to the high costs of obesity to the healthcare system, 
obesity also impacts work productivity. We aimed to estimate the benefits of 
preventing obesity in terms of years of life, productivity-adjusted life years 
(PALYs) and associated costs over 10 years.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Dynamic life table models were constructed to estimate years 
of life and PALYs saved if all new cases of obesity were prevented among 
Australians aged 20-69 years from 2021 to 2030. Life tables were sex specific 
and the population was classified into normal weight, overweight and obese. The 
model simulation was first undertaken assuming currently observed age-specific 
incidences of obesity, and then repeated assuming all new cases of obesity were 
reduced by 2 and 5%. The differences in outcomes (years of life, PALYs, and 
costs) between the two modelled outputs reflected the potential benefits that 
could be achieved through obesity prevention. All outcomes were discounted by 5% 
per annum.
RESULTS: Over the next 10 years, 132 million years of life and 81 million PALYs 
would be lived by Australians aged 20-69 years, contributing AU$17.0 trillion to 
the Australian economy in terms of GDP. A 5% reduction in new cases of obesity 
led to a gain of 663 years of life and 1229 PALYs, equivalent to AU$262 million 
in GDP.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of obesity is projected to result in substantial 
economic gains due to improved health and productivity. This further emphasises 
the need for public health prevention strategies to reduce this growing 
epidemic.

The current paper proposes a method to estimate phase to phase cross-frequency 
coupling between brain areas, applied to broadband signals, without any a priori 
hypothesis about the frequency of the synchronized components. N:m 
synchronization is the only form of cross-frequency synchronization that allows 
the exchange of information at the time resolution of the faster signal, hence 
likely to play a fundamental role in large-scale coordination of brain activity. 
The proposed method, named cross-frequency phase linearity measurement (CF-PLM), 
builds and expands upon the phase linearity measurement, an iso-frequency 
connectivity metrics previously published by our group. The main idea lies in 
using the shape of the interferometric spectrum of the two analyzed signals in 
order to estimate the strength of cross-frequency coupling. We first provide a 
theoretical explanation of the metrics. Then, we test the proposed metric on 
simulated data from coupled oscillators synchronized in iso- and cross-frequency 
(using both Rössler and Kuramoto oscillator models), and subsequently apply it 
on real data from brain activity. Results show that the method is useful to 
estimate n:m synchronization, based solely on the phase of the signals 
(independently of the amplitude), and no a-priori hypothesis is available about 
the expected frequencies.
