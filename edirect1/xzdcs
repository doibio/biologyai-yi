El objetivo es ilustrar al lector sobre un tumor infrecuente en la literatura 
médica y resumir los conocimientos actuales que se tienen sobre esta patología. 
Caso clínico: Reportamos el caso de un varón en la quinta década de la vida, a 
quien se realizó ecocardiograma transtorácico por deterioro de la clase 
funcional. La ultrasonografía evidenció un tumor que ocupaba el 95% de la 
aurícula izquierda, con compromiso hemodinámico e hipertensión pulmonar grave. 
Luego de estudios de extensión, fue llevado a cirugía para extracción de la masa 
por esternotomía media. La patología reveló sarcoma de alto grado indiferenciado 
sin compromiso linfovascular. This text aimed to illustrate the reader about one 
of the most infrequent tumors in the medical literature and discuss based on 
current literature what is known to date of this pathology. Case report: We 
report the case of a male in the fifth decade of life, who underwent 
transthoracic echocardiography due to impairment of the functional class. 
Ultrasound showed tumor lesion that occupied 95% of the left atrium, with 
hemodynamic compromise and severe pulmonary hypertension. After extension 
studies, he was taken to surgery with total mass extraction by middle 
stereotomy. The pathology revealed undifferentiated high-grade sarcoma without 
lymphovascular involvement.

Nowadays the exploration and utilisation of food and feed from marine origin is 
becoming more important with the increase of human population. Macroalgae are 
rich in nutritious compounds, which can directly be used in human and animal 
feed industries. The current study presents the screening of chemical components 
of eight macroalgae species, Sargassum boveanum, Sirophysalis trinodis, Hypnea 
caroides, Palisda perforata, Galaxaura rugosa, Caulerpa racemose, Caulerpa 
sertularioides and Bryopsis corticolans from the Persian Gulf. The results 
revealed that the eight studied algal species possess high protein (14.46% to 
38.20%), lipid (1.27% to 9.13%) and ash (15.50% to 49.14%) contents. The fatty 
acids and amino acids profile showed the presence of essential fatty acids and 
amino acids with high nutritional value. Phaeophyta species, S. boveanum and S. 
trinodis, showed the highest value of ash content and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids while Chlorophyta species, C. racemose, C. sertularioides and B. 
corticolans, showed the highest level of lipid and protein contents. Rhodophyta 
species, G. rugosa and P. perforata, showed the highest essential amino acid 
content. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of the studied 
marine species as a nutritional source for human and animal uses.

Purpose: Life expectancy is one of the indices used to analyze health status. 
This index changes during aging as a result of a variety of incidents, diseases, 
stress, and anxiety. Death anxiety is one of the problems that can turn into a 
deadly fear. This study was aimed to determine the association between life 
expectancy and death anxiety among older adults in Tehran, Iran. Methods: In 
this correlational descriptive study, 208 older adults aged ≥60 years, who had 
referred to adult daycare centers in Tehran, were chosen by cluster random 
sampling. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, Temper's death 
anxiety scale and Snyder's life expectancy scale. Data analysis was completed 
through SPSS ver. 22. Results: The mean age of the older adults was 66.60 (6.58) 
years. The results showed a mean death anxiety of 12.21 mean life expectancy of 
24.94. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated a negative 
correlation between death anxiety and life expectancy. The results of multiple 
regression analysis revealed that the major predictor of life expectancy decline 
were death anxiety, age, and residential status. Conclusion: It can be concluded 
from the results that the negative correlation between death anxiety and life 
expectancy requires teaching coping methods for anxiety and using appropriate 
methods to improve life expectancy among older adults.

PURPOSE: Clinical trials compare outcomes among patients receiving study 
treatment with comparators drawn from the same source. These internal controls 
are missing in single arm trials and from long-term extensions (LTE) of trials 
including only the treatment arm. An external control group derived from a 
different setting is then required to assess safety or effectiveness.
METHODS: We present examples of external control groups that demonstrate some of 
the issues that arise and make recommendations to address them through careful 
assessment of the data source fitness for use, design, and analysis steps.
RESULTS: Inclusion and exclusion criteria and context that produce a trial 
population may result in trial patients with different clinical characteristics 
than are present in an external comparison group. If these differences affect 
the risk of outcomes, then a comparison of outcome occurrence will be 
confounded. Further, patients who continue into LTE may differ from those 
initially entering the trial due to treatment effects. Application of 
appropriate methods is needed to make valid inferences when such treatment or 
selection effects are present. Outcome measures in a trial may be ascertained 
and defined differently from what can be obtained in an external comparison 
group. Differences in sensitivity and specificity for identification or 
measurement of study outcomes leads to information bias that can also invalidate 
inferences.
CONCLUSION: This review concentrates on threats to the valid use of external 
control groups both in the scenarios of single arm trials and LTE of randomized 
controlled trials, along with methodological approaches to mitigate them.

IMPORTANCE: One-year outcomes from the Early Venous Reflux Ablation (EVRA) 
randomized trial showed accelerated venous leg ulcer healing and greater 
ulcer-free time for participants who are treated with early endovenous ablation 
of lower extremity superficial reflux.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early endovenous 
ablation of superficial venous reflux in patients with venous leg ulceration.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between October 24, 2013, and September 27, 
2016, the EVRA randomized clinical trial enrolled 450 participants (450 legs) 
with venous leg ulceration of less than 6 months' duration and superficial 
venous reflux. Initially, 6555 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 6105 
were excluded for reasons including ulcer duration greater than 6 months, healed 
ulcer by the time of randomization, deep venous occlusive disease, and 
insufficient superficial venous reflux to warrant ablation therapy, among 
others. A total of 426 of 450 participants (94.7%) from the vascular surgery 
departments of 20 hospitals in the United Kingdom were included in the analysis 
for ulcer recurrence. Surgeons, participants, and follow-up assessors were not 
blinded to the treatment group. Data were analyzed from August 11 to November 4, 
2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive compression therapy 
with early endovenous ablation within 2 weeks of randomization (early 
intervention, n = 224) or compression with deferred endovenous treatment of 
superficial venous reflux (deferred intervention, n = 226). Endovenous modality 
and strategy were left to the preference of the treating clinical team.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome for the extended phase was time 
to first ulcer recurrence. Secondary outcomes included ulcer recurrence rate and 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The early-intervention group consisted of 224 participants (mean [SD] 
age, 67.0 [15.5] years; 127 men [56.7%]; 206 White participants [92%]). The 
deferred-intervention group consisted of 226 participants (mean [SD] age, 68.9 
[14.0] years; 120 men [53.1%]; 208 White participants [92%]). Of the 426 
participants whose leg ulcer had healed, 121 (28.4%) experienced at least 1 
recurrence during follow-up. There was no clear difference in time to first 
ulcer recurrence between the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57-1.17; 
P = .28). Ulcers recurred at a lower rate of 0.11 per person-year in the 
early-intervention group compared with 0.16 per person-year in the 
deferred-intervention group (incidence rate ratio, 0.658; 95% CI, 0.480-0.898; 
P = .003). Time to ulcer healing was shorter in the early-intervention group for 
primary ulcers (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64; P = .002). At 3 years, 
early intervention was 91.6% likely to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay 
of £20 000 ($26 283) per quality-adjusted life year and 90.8% likely at a 
threshold of £35 000 ($45 995) per quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early endovenous ablation of superficial venous 
reflux was highly likely to be cost-effective over a 3-year horizon compared 
with deferred intervention. Early intervention accelerated the healing of venous 
leg ulcers and reduced the overall incidence of ulcer recurrence.

Association of Mortality and Years of Potential Life Lost With Active 
Tuberculosis in the United States.

IMPORTANCE: Active tuberculosis (TB) disease leads to substantial mortality but 
is preventable through screening and treatment for latent TB infection. Early 
mortality after TB diagnosis (≤1 year) is well described, but delayed mortality 
(>1 year) among patients with active TB is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To compare early and delayed mortality and years of potential life 
(YPL) lost among patients with active TB disease vs an age-, sex-, and year of 
diagnosis-matched comparison cohort without active TB disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study, conducted in 
the integrated health system of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, included 
patients with microbiologically confirmed active TB disease from January 1, 
1997, to December 31, 2017, and a control cohort matched by age, sex, and year 
of diagnosis. Multivariable models were used to adjust for demographic and 
clinical characteristics. Patients with active TB disease prior to 1997 were 
excluded. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020.
EXPOSURE: Microbiologically confirmed TB disease.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Early (≤1 year after TB diagnosis) and delayed (>1 
year after TB diagnosis) all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2522 patients who had active TB from 1997 to 2017 were 
identified, with 17 166 person-years of follow-up. The comparison cohort 
included 100 880 persons with 735 726 person-years of follow-up. In the active 
TB and comparison cohorts, similar percentages of persons were male (56.3% vs 
55.6%), aged 45 to 64 years (33.7% vs 33.7%), and aged 65 years or older (24.7% 
vs 24.7%). Both early mortality (7.0%) and delayed mortality (16.3%) were higher 
among patients with active TB disease compared with those without active TB 
disease (1.1% and 12.0%, respectively). Patients with active TB disease had a 
significantly higher risk for early (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 7.29; 95% CI, 
6.08-8.73) and delayed (aHR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.61-1.98) mortality compared with 
the comparison cohort (P < .001). Active TB disease was associated with an 
adjusted -7.0 (95% CI, -8.4 to -5.5) YPL lost compared with the comparison 
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, patients with active TB disease had 
significantly higher early and delayed all-cause mortality when adjusting for 
demographic and clinical characteristics. These findings suggest that TB 
prevention through screening and treatment of latent TB infection could reduce 
mortality and YPL lost due to active TB disease.

Alexander disease is a very rare neurodegenerative disease that generally 
presents in the infantile period, although other variants are occasionally seen. 
This disorder, first described in 1949 by W. Stewart Alexander, is part of a 
group of neurological disorders, which is collectively known as 
leukodystrophies. These disorders are a group of rare, progressive, 
metabolic, genetic diseases (neurogenetic diseases) that predominantly affect 
the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS) with or without peripheral 
nervous system involvement and characterized by abnormal development or 
destruction of the myelin sheath. Alexander disease is caused by a mutation in 
the GFAP gene that codes for the fibrillar acid glial protein and represents the 
only known example of a genetic disorder affecting astrocyte cells. It is, thus, 
an example of a primary disease of astrocytes. The disease has multiple clinical 
forms spanning from newborn to adult, and typically, the early onset of the 
disease correlates with an increase in severity. Interestingly, before the 
genetic features were well understood, various names were used to characterize 
features of Alexander disease such as 'dysmyelinogenic leukodystrophy' or 
'demyelinogenic leukodystrophy' or 'fibrinoid degeneration of astrocytes' or 
'Leukodystrophy with Rosenthal fibers.' However, these terms are not typically 
used anymore.  The diagnosis can be made based on clinical and imaging features. 
After the diagnosis is suspected, genetic testing is usually done for 
confirmation. The treatment of Alexander disease is largely supportive (e.g., 
anticonvulsants for seizures), and patients have a variable life expectancy. The 
neonatal type is related to severe disability or death within two years. 
Children affected children by the infantile form (within 2-4 years of age) 
survive weeks to several years. On the contrary, when the disease begins after 
4-5 years (juvenile and adult forms), survival is variable and can even reach 30 
years of age and more. This chapter is aimed at describing the etiology, 
clinical evaluation, and management options available for Alexander disease. 
Moreover, the importance of the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for 
patients affected by this heritable disorder is also addressed.

BACKGROUND: The adult mammalian heart has little regenerative capacity after 
myocardial infarction (MI), whereas neonatal mouse heart regenerates without 
scarring or dysfunction. However, the underlying pathways are poorly defined. We 
sought to derive insights into the pathways regulating neonatal development of 
the mouse heart and cardiac regeneration post-MI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Total RNA-seq of mouse heart through the first 10 days of 
postnatal life (referred to as P3, P5, P10) revealed a previously unobserved 
transition in microRNA (miRNA) expression between P3 and P5 associated 
specifically with altered expression of protein-coding genes on the focal 
adhesion pathway and cessation of cardiomyocyte cell division. We found profound 
changes in the coding and noncoding transcriptome after neonatal MI, with 
evidence of essentially complete healing by P10. Over two-thirds of each of the 
messenger RNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and miRNAs that were differentially 
expressed in the post-MI heart were differentially expressed during normal 
postnatal development, suggesting a common regulatory pathway for normal cardiac 
development and post-MI cardiac regeneration. We selected exemplars of miRNAs 
implicated in our data set as regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Several 
of these showed evidence of a functional influence on mouse cardiomyocyte cell 
division. In addition, a subset of these miRNAs, miR-144-3p, miR-195a-5p, 
miR-451a, and miR-6240 showed evidence of functional conservation in human 
cardiomyocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: The sets of messenger RNAs, miRNAs, and long noncoding RNAs that we 
report here merit further investigation as gatekeepers of cell division in the 
postnatal heart and as targets for extension of the period of cardiac 
regeneration beyond the neonatal period.

Shenyang 110819, China.

Demands for the detection of harmful gas in daily life have arisen for a period 
and a gas nano-sensor acting as a kind of instrument that can directly detect 
gas has been of wide concern. The spinel-type nanomaterial is suitable for the 
research of gas sensors because of its unique structure. However, the existing 
instability, higher detection limit, and operating temperature of the spinel 
materials limit the extension of the spinel material sensor. This paper reviews 
the research progress of spinel materials in gas sensor technology in recent 
years and lists the common morphological structures and material sensitization 
methods in combination with previous works.

BACKGROUND: Objectives: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a costly disease with a 
limited life-expectancy as it generally presents as an advanced, metastatic 
disease. Though current literature suggests cost varies by first line treatment, 
there is limited real-world knowledge about the economic burden of pancreatic 
cancer. This study describes the economic burden of pancreatic cancer patients 
overall and by observed first line treatments.
METHODS: The IBM MarketScan databases were used to identify adult metastatic PC 
patients from January 1, 2010 through 3/31/2017. Those without other primary 
cancers, pregnancy, or prior PC treatment, and with 6 months of continuous 
enrollment prior to PC were included. Treatment patterns and healthcare 
utilization and expenditures were measured during the variable-length follow-up 
period. Continuous measures were presented as per patient per month (PPPM).
RESULTS: A total of 6,360 patients met all inclusion criteria. Almost half 
(46.8%) of patients were untreated. Gemcitabine alone (15.6%) and FOLFIRINOX 
(11.4%) were the most commonly observed first line regimens. Treated patients 
incurred $17,513 PPPM (Gemcitabine alone) to $27,889 PPPM (FOLFIRINOX) during 
follow-up. Untreated patients incurred the highest unadjusted ($30,777 PPPM) and 
adjusted ($20,392 PPPM) cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic PC patients incur a high economic burden driven by high 
utilization of healthcare resources, which varies by first line treatment. Also, 
the high proportion of untreated patients is alarming as these patients may be 
the most expensive of all patients. There is an unmet need in these patients for 
effective treatments that also reduce their economic burden.

BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) can help to enhance the care of patients 
with limited life expectancy. Despite physicians' key role in ACP, the ways in 
which physicians estimate and communicate prognosis can be improved.
AIM: To determine how physicians in different care settings self-assess their 
performance in estimating and communicating prognosis to patients in palliative 
care, and how they perceive their communication with other physicians about 
patients' poor prognosis.
DESIGN & SETTING: A survey study was performed among a random sample of GPs, 
hospital physicians (HPs), and nursing home physicians (NHPs) in the southwest 
of the Netherlands (n = 2212).
METHOD: A questionnaire was developed that had three versions for GPs, HPs, and 
NHPs. Each specialism filled in an appropriate version.
RESULTS: A total of 547 physicians participated: 259 GPs, 205 HPs, and 83 NHPs. 
In the study, 61.1% of physicians indicated being able to adequately estimate 
whether a patient will die within 1 year, which was associated with use of the 
Surprise Question (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, P = 0.042). In the case of a 
prognosis of <1 year, 75.0% of physicians indicated that they communicate with 
patients about preferences regarding treatment and care, which was associated 
with physicians being trained in palliative care (OR = 2.02, P=0.007). In cases 
where patients with poor prognosis are discharged after hospital admission, 
83.4% of HPs indicated that they inform GPs about these patients' preferences 
compared with 29.0% of GPs, and 21.7% of NHPs, who indicated that they are 
usually adequately informed about the preferences.
CONCLUSION: The majority of physicians indicated that they believe they can 
adequately estimate patients' limited life expectancy and that they discuss 
patients' preferences for care. However, more physicians should be trained in 
communicating about patients' poor prognosis and care preferences.

Inappropriate prescribing of diagnostic procedures and treatments should be 
avoided for good medical practice. Furthermore, the therapeutic plan of each 
patient should be regularly revised, activating deprescription procedures to 
reduce the dosage or to discontinue unnecessary drugs. It has widely been 
reported that the number of drugs taken by each patient increases over the years 
and adverse events caused by polypharmacy therapy are increasingly reported. 
Polypharmacy is due to multimorbidity related to longer life expectancy, but it 
is also induced by drug manufacturers' pressures, the practice of prescribing 
one product to counteract the adverse effects of another, the division into 
subspecialties inducing clinicians to solve the specific problem regardless of 
the patient therapeutic profile, and the uncritical implementation of current 
guidelines. The recommendations published by scientific societies for the 
international Choosing Wisely project allow to identify practices at risk of 
inappropriateness, and programs are available to help evaluating the risks of 
several drug associations, taking into consideration different aspects of 
pharmacology, drug interactions, potentially inappropriate in the elderly, 
according to different criteria from the scientific literature. The safety of 
reducing or withdrawing under strict medical supervision some cardiovascular 
treatments has been demonstrated, with documented benefits for the patients.

Endoscopic stenting of the colorectum has emerged as a viable alternative to 
surgical interventions in a selected group of patients. The main indication for 
stenting is bowel obstruction. As such stenting can be used to palliate patients 
with metastatic disease or bridge patients to surgical intervention. The main 
advantages of stenting in the emergency setting include lower morbidity and 
mortality, lower incidence of stoma formation, shorter hospitalization, and 
better quality of life. For patients with unresectable disease and short life 
expectancy, stenting can be considered. However, for patients with longer life 
expectancy, the potential long-term complications of a metal stent such as 
erosion, migration, or obstruction have engendered debate whether such patients 
are better served by operative intervention. Stenting as a bridge to surgery is 
an alternative to surgery in patients who are high risk for emergency surgery 
but concerns remain regarding its impact on oncologic outcome in potentially 
curable patients.

 Head and neck (H&N) cancers account for 4% of total cancers diagnosed. However, 
quality of life (QoL) implications are more severe for this patient population 
due to the complexity, extent, and deformities resulting from treatment 
interventions. Principally debilitating complications include diminished 
functional walking capacity, reduced cervical range of motion (ROM), and 
scapular strength. An extensive literature search revealed a paucity of evidence 
utilizing physical therapy assessment and intervention for this population. The 
purpose of this study was to describe the development and clinical feasibility 
of a prehabilitation program aimed to thwart these complications for patients 
diagnosed with H&N cancer.  Methods: Inclusion criteria: male or female, 18+ 
years, speak and read the English language, ambulate independently, diagnosed 
with H&N cancer, and scheduled for surgical intervention. Institutional Review 
Board approval was obtained. Pre- and post-surgical measurements included the 
six-minute walk test (6MWT), cervical ROM, manual muscle testing for scapular 
strength, and three questionnaires: physical activity history, health behaviors 
questionnaire, and the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy H&N QoL survey.  
Results: Three participants were enrolled (two males and one female) all 
identifying as Caucasian and between 60-90 years of age. Pre- to post-cervical 
ROM demonstrated decline in extension/bilateral rotation for two of three 
participants. Two participants demonstrated decreased 6MWT distance while one 
increased. No participants experienced any adverse effects of the 
prehabilitation program.  Conclusion: This is the first study protocol to 
describe a physical therapist-administered H&N cancer prehabilitation program. 
Professionally administered education and exercise has potential to prevent, 
manage, and mitigate the adverse effects of cancer treatment. Additional 
research is needed to define the importance of prehabilitation relative to 
improved clinical outcomes and improved QoL. Patients with a cancer diagnosis 
are susceptible to impairments and functional limitations as a result of 
treatments and this prehabilitation program demonstrates potential to positively 
impact outcomes across the survivorship continuum. Due to their education and 
integration within the medical system, physical therapists are well-positioned 
to lead the effort to unify theory and clearly define parameters for oncology 
prehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Individualizing goals for people with type 2 diabetes may result in 
deintensification of medication, but a comprehensive picture of deprescribing 
practices is lacking.
AIMS: To conduct a scoping review in order to assess the rates, determinants and 
success of implementing deprescribing of glucose-, blood pressure- or 
lipid-lowering medications in people with diabetes.
METHODS: A systematic search on MEDLINE and Embase between January 2007 and 
January 2019 was carried out for deprescribing studies among people with 
diabetes. Outcomes were rates of deprescribing related to participant 
characteristics, the determinants and success of deprescribing, and its 
implementation. Critical appraisal was conducted using predefined tools.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included; eight reported on rates, nine on 
determinants and six on success and implementation. Bias was high for studies on 
success of deprescribing. Deprescribing rates ranged from 14% to 27% in older 
people with low HbA1c levels, and from 16% to 19% in older people with low 
systolic blood pressure. Rates were not much affected by age, gender, frailty or 
life expectancy. Rates were higher when a reminder system was used to identify 
people with hypoglycaemia, which led to less overtreatment and fewer 
hypoglycaemic events. Most healthcare professionals accepted the concept of 
deprescribing but differed on when to conduct it. Deprescribing glucose-lowering 
medications could be successfully conducted in 62% to 75% of participants with 
small rises in HbA1c .
CONCLUSIONS: Deprescribing of glucose-lowering medications seems feasible and 
acceptable, but was not widely implemented in the covered period. Support 
systems may enhance deprescribing. More studies on deprescribing blood pressure- 
and lipid-lowering medications in people with diabetes are needed.

Denmark, Odense, Denmark.

This study analyzes the complexity of female longevity improvements. As 
socioeconomic status is found to influence health and mortality, we partition 
all individuals, at each age in every year, into five socioeconomic groups based 
on an affluence measure that combine an individual's income and wealth. We 
identify the particular socioeconomic groups that have been driving the 
standstill for Danish females at older ages. Within each socioeconomic group, we 
further analyze the cause of death patterns. The decline in life expectancy for 
Danish females is present for four out of five subgroups, however, with 
particular large decreases for the low-middle and middle-affluence groups. 
Cancers, smoking-related lung and bronchus causes, and other diseases 
particularly contribute to the stagnation. For four of the five socioeconomic 
groups only small cardiovascular improvement are experienced during the period 
of stagnating life expectancy compared to an equally long and subsequent period.

Prognosis communication in heart failure is often narrowly defined as a 
discussion of life expectancy, but as clinical guidelines and research suggest, 
these discussions should provide a broader understanding of the disease, 
including information about disease trajectory, the experiences of living with 
heart failure, potential burden on patients and families, and mortality. 
Furthermore, despite clinical guidelines recommending early discussions, 
evidence suggests that these discussions occur infrequently or late in the 
disease trajectory. We review the literature concerning patient, caregiver, and 
clinician perspectives on discussions of this type, including the frequency, 
timing, desire for, effects of, and barriers to their occurrence. We propose an 
alternate view of prognosis communication, in which the patient and 
family/caregiver are educated about the nature of the disease at the time of 
diagnosis, and a process of engagement is undertaken so that the patient's full 
participation in their care is marshalled, and the care team engages the patient 
in the informed decision making that will guide care throughout the disease 
trajectory. We also identify and discuss evidence gaps concerning (i) patient 
preferences and readiness for prognosis information along the trajectory; (ii) 
best practices for communicating prognosis information; and (iii) effects of 
prognosis communication on patient's quality of life, mental health, engagement 
in critical self-care, and clinical outcomes. Research is needed to determine 
best practices for engaging patients in prognosis communication and for 
evaluating the effects of this communication on patient engagement and clinical 
outcomes.

With the constant increase in life expectancy and the development of chronic 
diseases in the elderly population, the General Direction of Health of the 
Canton of Vaud has developed a community plan to strengthen the care of 
residents in psychological crisis. This strong position of Public Health has 
made it possible to carry out an ambitious project, with a view to « care 
management » in elderly psychiatry, involving partners from the care network and 
promoting care at the place of residence of the individual. This project made it 
possible to develop recommendations for the strengthening of local and 
outpatient care, in order to reduce the systematic recourse to hospitalization, 
and the increase in functional dependence of the elderly on leaving the 
hospital.

School of Medicine, Stanford, California.

IMPORTANCE: There is no consensus regarding optimal management of pleomorphic 
adenoma in adults.
OBJECTIVES: To compare parotidectomy with observation for the management of 
pleomorphic adenoma in patients 50 years or older by age.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This decision analytical model was performed from November 
21, 2019, to June 15, 2020, using a Markov model. Model variables and ranges 
were selected based on a literature review. A 1-way sensitivity analysis was 
performed to evaluate the age threshold at which each algorithm, either upfront 
elective parotidectomy or observation, would be favored. A Monte Carlo 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis using variable ranges was then performed 5 
times with patients in the model assigned a starting age of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 
90 years to assess how age at diagnosis would be associated with the model 
results.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model outcomes were measured with quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: In the study models, the age thresholds at which observation became 
more beneficial than parotidectomy were 88.5 years for patients with superficial 
lobe tumors (5.37 QALYs in favor of parotidectomy below this age, and 5.37 QALYs 
in favor of observation above this age) and 83.4 years for patients with deep 
lobe tumors (7.51 QALYs in favor of surgery below this age, and 7.51 QALYs in 
favor of observation above this age). There was no significant difference in 
outcomes between parotidectomy and observation among patients aged 70 to 80 
years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that the outcomes associated with 
parotidectomy and observation are similar at 70 years or older among patients 
with pleomorphic adenoma and that observation may be the favorable treatment in 
that age group.

IMPORTANCE: Machine learning (ML) algorithms can identify patients with cancer 
at risk of short-term mortality to inform treatment and advance care planning. 
However, no ML mortality risk prediction algorithm has been prospectively 
validated in oncology or compared with routinely used prognostic indices.
OBJECTIVE: To validate an electronic health record-embedded ML algorithm that 
generated real-time predictions of 180-day mortality risk in a general oncology 
cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study comprised a prospective 
cohort of patients with outpatient oncology encounters between March 1, 2019, 
and April 30, 2019. An ML algorithm, trained on retrospective data from a subset 
of practices, predicted 180-day mortality risk between 4 and 8 days before a 
patient's encounter. Patient encounters took place in 18 medical or gynecologic 
oncology practices, including 1 tertiary practice and 17 general oncology 
practices, within a large US academic health care system. Patients aged 18 years 
or older with outpatient oncology or hematology and oncology encounters were 
included in the analysis. Patients were excluded if their appointment was 
scheduled after weekly predictions were generated and if they were only 
evaluated in benign hematology, palliative care, or rehabilitation practices.
EXPOSURES: Gradient-boosting ML binary classifier.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the patients' 180-day 
mortality from the index encounter. The primary performance metric was the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Among 24 582 patients, 1022 (4.2%) died within 180 days of their index 
encounter. Their median (interquartile range) age was 64.6 (53.6-73.2) years, 15 
319 (62.3%) were women, 18 015 (76.0%) were White, and 10 658 (43.4%) were seen 
in the tertiary practice. The AUC was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88-0.90) for the full 
cohort. The AUC varied across disease-specific groups within the tertiary 
practice (AUC ranging from 0.74 to 0.96) but was similar between the tertiary
