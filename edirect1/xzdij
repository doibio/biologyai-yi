BACKGROUND: In the present-day world, the aging elderly across the world are 
living longer. Most people are expected to live well into their sixties and even 
beyond. The increasing life expectancy of the aging population could be due to 
increased availability of healthcare facilities and improved quality care 
provided by them. Alongside increasing life expectancy, the individual's quality 
of life and also his/her oral health-related quality of life (OHR-QoL) are 
expected to improve so that they can enjoy their aging life.
AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review article is to highlight aging-related 
oral health changes and their impact on the individual's quality of life.
REVIEW RESULTS: Age-related oral changes are seen in the tooth structure making 
the enamel more brittle resulting in severe attrition. Autoimmune diseases like 
Sjogren's syndrome are followed by decrease in the salivary gland function and 
the reason is unknown, and medications like antihypertensive and analgesics are 
associated with the decrease in salivary flow, which increases the patient's 
risk of developing dental caries, and also make the oral tissues more prone to 
mucosal infections. Edentulism has also been directly related to masticatory 
problems and nutritional problems. The studies reported on OHR-QoL of these 
frail elderly populations have shown lower scores.
CONCLUSION: It is important for health professionals, especially those dealing 
with these frail elderly populations, to have a better understanding of their 
dental needs and also understand the physiologic changes undergone by them. The 
health professionals should understand and comprehend the oral health challenges 
these vulnerable people face.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Healthcare providers should conduct periodic oral 
examinations along with general examination and should avoid prescribing 
medications that have xerostomia as a side effect. The elderly individuals 
should be encouraged to keep their mouth moist using water or artificial saliva 
and maintain good oral and denture hygiene.

Superfund sites could affect life expectancy (LE) via increasing the likelihood 
of exposure to toxic chemicals. Here, we assess to what extent such presence 
could alter the LE independently and in the context of sociodemographic 
determinants. A nationwide geocoded statistical modeling at the census tract 
level was undertaken to estimate the magnitude of impact. Results showed a 
significant difference in LE among census tracts with at least one Superfund 
site and their neighboring tracts with no sites. The presence of a Superfund 
site could cause a decrease of -0.186 ± 0.027 years in LE. This adverse effect 
could be as high as -1.22 years in tracts with Superfund sites and high 
sociodemographic disadvantage. Specific characteristics of Superfund sites such 
as being prone to flooding and the absence of a cleanup strategy could amplify 
the adverse effect. Furthermore, the presence of Superfund sites amplifies the 
negative influence of sociodemographic factors at lower LEs.

Hemophilia is a rare disorder that is difficult to diagnose and manage. The 
prevalence of end-stage renal disease is increasing in hemophilic patients 
because of improved life expectancy. Renal transplant surgery in such patients 
is often complicated by adverse hematological events such as bleeding and 
intravesical thrombosis, both with a risk of renal allograft rejection. We 
report a case of a 46-year-old hemophilia A patient on hemodialysis who 
underwent renal transplant and show that although challenging, renal transplant 
in hemophilic patients is possible.

Objectives: Despite recent advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), few population-based studies have assessed the mortality rates and the 
underlying causes of death (UCDs) among patients with RA and RA-associated 
interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD). This study evaluated the trends in mortality 
rates, demographic characteristics, and UCDs among patients with RA-ILD.Method: 
Using data from death certificates (1999-2018) from the US Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention Multiple Cause of Death files, we explored the trends in 
mortality rates and UCD for patients with RA and RA-ILD. Moreover, we examined 
the crude and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) for such 
patients.Results: Among patients with RA or RA-ILD, ASMR variation decreased 
over 20 years. The ASMR ratio of RA-ILD to RA decreased by 5.84%. The ASMR for 
RA and RA-ILD stratified by gender or age group also decreased. The change in 
the ASMR ratio of RA-ILD to RA trended downwards in women and upwards in men. 
Arthropathies and ILD were the most frequent UCDs for RA-ILD, while 
arthropathies and ischaemic heart disease were the most frequent UCDs for 
RA.Conclusions: Although RA and RA-ILD presented a downward trend in mortality, 
RA combined with ILD may reduce life expectancy. Specifically, the mortality 
rate for patients with RA-ILD remained relatively stable during the study period 
when ILD was the UCD, suggesting the need for active prevention, early 
diagnosis, and effective management of RA-ILD.

Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis: 5-Year Results from the 
UNCOVER-1 and -2 Studies.

Gooderham MJ, Elewski B, Augustin M, Iversen L, Torii H, Burge R, See K, Gallo 
G, Eastman WJ, McKean-Matthews M, Foley P.

OBJECTIVE: We describe patient-reported outcomes and quality of life through 5 
years of treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the 
UNCOVER-1 and -2 studies.
METHODS: This analysis included patients who were randomized to ixekizumab every 
2 weeks then received ixekizumab every 4 weeks during the maintenance period, 
and who achieved static physician global assessment (0,1) at week 12, completed 
week 60, and entered the long-term extension period (weeks 60&ndash;264). 
Outcomes measures included responses in itch numeric rating scale (NRS), skin 
pain visual analog scale (VAS), and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) (0,1), 
and mean change from baseline in short form health survey (SF-36) mental (MCS) 
and physical component summaries (PCS), psoriasis skin appearance bothersomeness 
(PSAB), and work productivity activity impairment (WPAI).
RESULTS: At week 264 in UNCOVER-1 and -2, the observed itch NRS &ge;4 responses 
were 82.4% and 93.1%, respectively, the itch NRS=0 responses were 51.7% and 
58.5%, respectively, the skin pain VAS=0 responses were 59.3% and 63.1%, 
respectively, and the DLQI (0,1) responses were 75.0% and 88.1%, respectively. 
The observed mean changes from baseline at week 264 in UNCOVER-1 and UNCOVER-2 
were 3.4 and 6.5, respectively, for SF-36 MCS, 4.4 and 4.8, respectively, for 
SF-36 PCS, and -21.3 and -22.0, respectively, for PSAB. WPAI psoriasis item 
scores improved from baseline in both UNCOVER-1 and -2.
CONCLUSION: Ixekizumab provided clinically meaningful and sustained improvements 
in itch, skin pain, DLQI, PSAB, SF-36 PCS, SF-36 MCS, and WPAI through 5 years 
of treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. J Drugs

PURPOSE: The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is the most 
commonly used patient reported outcome (PRO) tool in prostate cancer (PC) 
clinical trials, but health utilities associated with the different health 
states assessed with this tool are unknown, limiting our ability to perform 
cost-utility analyses. This study aimed to map EPIC tool to EuroQoL-5D-3L (EQ5D) 
to generate EQ5D health utilities.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective, randomized 
non-inferiority clinical trial, conducted between 04/2006 and 12/2009 at cancer 
centers across the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. Eligible patients 
included men >18 years with a known diagnosis of low-risk PC. Patient HRQoL data 
were collected using EPIC and health utilities were obtained using EQ5D. Data 
were divided into an estimation sample (n = 765, 70%) and a validation sample (n 
= 327, 30%). The mapping algorithms that capture the relationship between the 
instruments were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and 
two-part models. Five-fold cross-validation (in-sample) was used to compare the 
predictive performance of the estimated models. Final models were selected based 
on root mean square error (RMSE).
RESULTS: A total of 565 patients in the estimation sample had complete 
information on both EPIC and EQ5D questionnaires at baseline. Mean observed EQ5D 
utility was 0.90±0.13 (range: 0.28-1) with 55% of patients in full health. OLS 
models outperformed their counterpart Tobit and two-part models for all 
pre-determined model specifications. The best model fit was: "EQ5D utility = 
0.248541 + 0.000748*(Urinary Function) + 0.001134*(Urinary Bother) + 
0.000968*(Hormonal Function) + 0.004404*(Hormonal Bother)- 0.376487*(Zubrod) + 
0.003562*(Urinary Function*Zubrod)"; RMSE was 0.10462.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to identify a comprehensive set of mapping 
algorithms to generate EQ5D utilities from EPIC domain/ sub-domain scores. The 
study results will help estimate quality-adjusted life-years in PC economic 
evaluations.

Comment in
    Chest. 2021 Sep;160(3):805-806.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines recommend management strategies for 
malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) based on life expectancy. Existent 
risk-prediction rules do not provide precise individualized survival estimates.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a newly developed continuous risk-prediction survival 
model for patients with MPE and known metastatic disease provide precise 
survival estimates?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study of patients 
with proven malignancy, pleural effusion, and known metastatic disease 
undergoing thoracentesis from 2014 through 2017. The outcome was time from 
thoracentesis to death. Risk factors were identified using Cox proportional 
hazards models. Effect-measure modification (EMM) was tested using the 
Mantel-Cox test and was addressed by using disease-specific models (DSMs) or 
interaction terms. Three DSMs and a combined model using interactions were 
generated. Discrimination was evaluated using Harrell's C-statistic. Calibration 
was assessed by observed-minus-predicted probability graphs at specific time 
points. Models were validated using patients treated from 2010 through 2013. 
Using LENT (pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and tumor type) 
variables, we generated both discrete (LENT-D) and continuous (LENT-C) models, 
assessing discrete vs continuous predictors' performances.
RESULTS: The development and validation cohort included 562 and 727 patients, 
respectively. The Mantel-Cox test demonstrated interactions between cancer type 
and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (P < .0001), pleural fluid lactate 
dehydrogenase (P = .029), and bilateral effusion (P = .002). DSMs for lung, 
breast, and hematologic malignancies showed C-statistics of 0.72, 0.72, and 
0.62, respectively; the combined model's C-statistics was 0.67. LENT-D 
(C-statistic, 0.60) and LENT-C (C-statistic, 0.65) models underperformed.
INTERPRETATION: EMM is present between cancer type and other predictors; thus, 
DSMs outperformed the models that failed to account for this. Discrete 
risk-prediction models lacked enough precision to be useful for individual-level 
predictions.

BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is the most common cancer worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the burden of skin cancer in the US from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Age-standardized incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY), and mortality rates from skin cancer in the US were evaluated from the 
Global Burden of Disease 2019.
RESULTS: Incidence, prevalence, DALY, and mortality rates for melanoma per 
100,000 persons in 2019 were 17.0, 138, 64.8, and 2.2, respectively; for 
squamous cell carcinoma, rates were 262, 314, 26.6, and 0.8, respectively; and 
for basal cell carcinoma, rates were 525, 51.2, 0.2, and zero, respectively. 
Incidence and prevalence rates of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) 
have increased since 1990, while mortality rates have remained fairly stable. 
Males have had higher incidence, prevalence, DALY, and mortality rates from 
melanoma and NMSC every year since 1990. Incidence and prevalence of melanoma 
was relatively higher in the northern half of the US than in the southern half.
LIMITATIONS: Global Burden of Disease is derived from estimation and 
mathematical modeling.
CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals can utilize differences and trends noted 
in this study to guide allocation of resources to reduce incidence and morbidity 
from skin cancer.

We describe the case of a 41-day-old infant with a left craniofacial cervical 
and subglottic hemangioma with respira-tory symptoms. Although infantile 
hemangiomas are occasional benign vascular tumors that appear predominantly on 
the skin, 1-2% of patients may have airway lesions that can sometimes cause 
potentially life-threatening respiratory condi-tions. The decision was made to 
immediately commence treatment with propranolol, without waiting to complete the 
exten-sion and syndromic diagnoses. There was a positive clinical response and 
respiratory symptoms dissipated in twelve hours. Early treatment with 
beta-blockers is essential for children with hemangiomas whose location causes 
symptoms or significant functional changes: in some cases it may be a matter of 
urgency.

While the incidence of spondylodiscitis is rising because of longer life 
expectancy and the increasing use of immunosuppressant drug, indwelling devices 
and spinal surgeries, the fungal aetiology remains rare, sometimes affecting 
intravenous drug users. Candida spondylodiscitis is an extremely rare 
complication post aortic aneurysm repair. It is potentially fatal due to the 
risk of aneurysm rupture and septic complications. The growing problem of 
systemic diseases caused by Candida species reflects the enormous increase of 
patients at risk. The treatment of this complicated entity is challenging and 
often requiring a multidisciplinary team. We reported the rare case of Candida 
spondylodiscitis contiguous to infected aortic aneurysm in a 74-year-old male 
intravenous drug user, to the extent which the vertebral body bony destruction 
progressed to need one-stage posterior and anterior spinal fusion surgery with 
curettage. Our surgical intervention combined with prolonged course of 
antifungal therapy could successfully eradicate the infection and resolve the 
neurological deficits.

This study assesses and compares the productive efficiency of the national 
healthcare system of the ASEAN region which includes Brunei, Cambodia, 
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam 
amidst rising mortality rate from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) era. Nonparametric data envelopment 
analysis technique based on the Malmquist Productivity Index is performed and 
its components, total factor productivity change, technical change and 
technological change are compared across the region. Two different models are 
considered in assessing and comparing the technical efficiency of the national 
healthcare system across the region with life expectancy at birth and mortality 
rate from NCDs as parallel health care output for both the models. The mean 
value of total factor productivity is 0.983 and 0.974 which suggests that 
national healthcare system productivity efficiency decays by 1.7% for Model I 
and 2.6% for Model II, respectively. This suggests that the health care system 
inefficiencies across the ASEAN region have not made life expectancy to improve 
as much as it should be and curtailed the mortality rate from growing chronic 
NCDs within a decade. The region is likely to lag behind in achieving SDGs 3 
target 4 on reducing by one-third premature mortality from chronic NCDs unless 
the health care system's technical efficiency is improved across the region. The 
finding suggests a microlevel study on each country to identify major sources of 
healthcare system inefficiency in a bid to ameliorate it.

BACKGROUND: In LABBPS (Los Angeles Barbershop Blood Pressure Study), 
pharmacist-led hypertension care in Los Angeles County Black-owned barbershops 
significantly improved blood pressure control in non-Hispanic Black men with 
uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In this analysis, 10-year health outcomes 
and health care costs of 1 year of the LABBPS intervention versus control are 
projected.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation of hypertension care processes projected 
blood pressure, medication-related adverse events, fatal and nonfatal 
cardiovascular disease events, and noncardiovascular disease death in LABBPS 
participants. Program costs, total direct health care costs (2019 US dollars), 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for the LABBPS 
intervention and control arms from a health care sector perspective over a 
10-year horizon. Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually. High and 
intermediate cost-effectiveness thresholds were defined as <$50 000 and 
<$150 000 per QALY gained, respectively.
RESULTS: At 10 years, the intervention was projected to cost an average of $2356 
(95% uncertainty interval, -$264 to $4611) more per participant than the control 
arm and gain 0.06 (95% uncertainty interval, 0.01-0.10) QALYs. The LABBPS 
intervention was highly cost-effective, with a mean cost of $42 717 per QALY 
gained (58% probability of being highly and 96% of being at least intermediately 
cost-effective). Exclusive use of generic drugs improved the cost-effectiveness 
to $17 162 per QALY gained. The LABBPS intervention would be only intermediately 
cost-effective if pharmacists were less likely to intensify antihypertensive 
medications when systolic blood pressure was ≥150 mm Hg or if pharmacist weekly 
time driving to barbershops increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension care delivered by clinical pharmacists in Black 
barbershops is a highly cost-effective way to improve blood pressure control in 
Black men.

BACKGROUND: The Chronic Disease Management Program (CDMP) of Korea has been 
introduced to improve care continuity in patients with hypertension and 
diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of the CDMP in patients 
with hypertension from the perspective of the healthcare payer.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on a Markov 
simulation model. The cost and effect of the CDMP versus usual care was compared 
in individuals aged 40 years or above. The two strategies were presumed to 
result in a difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and 
chronic kidney disease. The model was analyzed over the lifetime of the cohort. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the 
difference in lifetime costs by the difference in lifetime effects (quality 
adjusted life years, QALYs) between the two strategies. Costs were expressed in 
Korean Won (KRW).
RESULTS: The ICER value of the CDMP participation strategy was -5 761 088 
KRW/QALY compared to usual care. Similar tendencies were found when limiting the 
population to only clinic users (-3 843 355 KRW/QALY) and national health 
examination participants (-5 595 185 KRW/QALY).
CONCLUSION: The CDMP was highly cost-effective in patients with hypertension 
aged 40 years or above. Implementing efficient policies that enhance care 
coordination and improve outcomes in patients with hypertension is important.

PURPOSE: To present a summary of the recommendations for the treatment and 
follow-up for the biochemical recurrence of castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(PCa) as acquired through a questionnaire administered at the Prostate Cancer 
Consensus Conference for Developing Countries.
METHODS: A total of 27 questions were identified as relating to this topic. 
Responses from the clinician were tallied and are presented in percentage 
format. Topics included the use of imaging in staging, treatment recommendations 
across different patient scenarios of life expectancy and prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) doubling time, and follow-up for nonmetastatic 
castration-resistant PCa.
RESULTS: A consensus agreed that in optimal conditions, positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography with prostate-specific membrane antigen would be 
used although in limited resource situations the combined use of CT of the 
abdomen and pelvic (or pelvic MRI), a bone scan, and a CT of the thorax or chest 
x-ray was recommended. In cases when PSA levels double in < 10 months, more than 
90% of clinicians agreed on the use of apalutamide or enzalutamide, regardless 
of life expectancy. With a doubling time of more than 10 months, > 54% of 
experts recommended no treatment independent of life expectancy. More than half 
of the experts, regardless of resources, recommended follow-up with a physical 
examination and PSA levels every 3-6 months and imaging only in the case of 
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: The voting results and recommendations presented in this document 
can be used by physicians to support management for biochemical recurrence of 
castration-resistant PCa in areas of limited resources. Individual clinical 
decision making should be supported by available data.

Mitral Annular Calcification and Calcific Mitral Stenosis: Role of 
Echocardiography in Hemodynamic Assessment and Management.

As the life expectancy of the population continues to increase, mitral annular 
calcification has emerged as an important cause of mitral stenosis (MS), 
commonly referred to as calcific or degenerative MS. Mitral annular 
calcification results in valvular stenosis when calcification extends into the 
base of the mitral leaflet(s) and displaces the mitral valve hinge point(s) into 
the left ventricular inlet. Echocardiographic determination of mitral vale area 
is fraught with difficulties and often precludes using planimetry or the Hatle 
formula. Given the numerous confounders that affect transmitral flow in calcific 
MS, evaluation of lesion severity should incorporate flow-independent methods 
such as the continuity equation and the mitral valve dimensionless index. In 
light of the significant risks entailed, there is little enthusiasm for mitral 
valve replacement in patients with calcific MS. Transcatheter mitral valve 
replacement is generally offered on a compassionate use basis to patients deemed 
to be at high surgical risk.

BACKGROUND: In Scandinavia, people with a severe mental disorder have a reduced 
life expectancy of 15-20 years compared with the general public. Smoking is a 
major contributor, and smoke-free policies are increasingly adopted in 
psychiatric clinics around the world. We compared potential facilitators and 
barriers among staff and management, for the implementation of smoke-free 
psychiatric clinics.
AIMS: To investigate the attitudes and experiences regarding smoke-free policies 
among managers and staff involved in the implementation processes of smoke-free 
psychiatric clinics at hospitals in Malmö (Sweden) and Barcelona (Spain).
METHOD: We used a qualitative methodology, with 15 semi-structured interviews. 
The interviews were conducted with each participant individually, and were 
subsequently transcribed. The data were analysed with systematic text 
condensation.
RESULTS: There were notable differences in how the smoke-free policies were 
carried out and experienced, and attitudes regarding the policy changes differed 
in the two settings. Key differences were the views on the right to smoke in 
compulsory care and to stay in smoke-free surroundings supported by smoking 
cessation intervention; the prioritisation of staff facilitation of smoking 
breaks; and views on smoking and smoke-free psychiatry. In contrast, 
participants agreed on the importance of staff education and management support. 
A smoking ban by law and belonging to a network of smoke-free hospitals were 
also relevant.
CONCLUSIONS: Staff education, and support from staff and management for the 
patients' right to stay in smoke-free surroundings, facilitated successful 
implementation of smoke-free policies in the psychiatric clinics, whereas 
supporting the right to smoke was a barrier.

Individuals over 65years are the fastest expanding population throughout the 
world, due to the increase in human life expectancy. This growing geriatric 
population, with increasingly associated chronic diseases, has relevant medical, 
social, and economic impact. Aging is characterized by progressive structural 
and functional changes in the kidney and in the cardiovascular system, leading 
to decline in renal function and hypertension. The purpose of this review is to 
describe the aging-related renal changes and blood pressure regulation during 
the aging process, their impact with regards to morbidity and mortality in these 
patients, and to summarize the most appropriate therapeutic approaches in these 
situations based on the particularities of this population group.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) disease (COVID-19) 
is a novel threat that hampers life expectancy especially in obese individuals. 
Though this association is clinically relevant, the underlying mechanisms are 
not fully elucidated. SARS CoV2 enters host cells via the Angiotensin Converting 
Enzyme 2 receptor, that is also expressed in adipose tissue. Moreover, adipose 
tissue is also a source of many proinflammatory mediators and adipokines that 
might enhance the characteristic COVID-19 cytokine storm due to a chronic 
low-grade inflammatory preconditioning. Further obesity-dependent thoracic 
mechanical constraints may also incise negatively into the prognosis of obese 
subjects with COVID-19. This review summarizes the current body of knowledge on 
the obesity-dependent circumstances triggering an increased risk for COVID-19 
severity, and their clinical relevance.
