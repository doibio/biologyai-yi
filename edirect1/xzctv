patisiran, the first approved RNA interference-based therapeutic agent that 
suppresses the circulating levels of the amyloidogenic protein TTR both 
wild-type and mutant. This compound demonstrated a safe clinical profile in 
phase I and II studies and showed a significant clinical effect in a phase III 
(APOLLO) trial in ATTRv patients. An open-label-extension study is still 
underway but, based on the positive results, the regulatory agencies granted 
approval for the treatment of ATTRv with polyneuropathy in Stage I and II.Expert 
opinion: The patisiran program has demonstrated that substantial TTR 
concentration reduction is associated with significant and sustained improvement 
in polyneuropathy scores, quality-of-life profile and several outcome measures 
that capture the systemic burden of the disease. The drug resulted safe also in 
long term follow-up studies while its efficacy for ATTR with cardiomyopathy is 
under investigation.

Cost-effectiveness of Hepatitis A vaccination in a developed and developing 
country.

Ghildayal N(1).

PURPOSE: Hepatitis A is a prevalent disease that is largely preventable by 
vaccine usage. The vaccine for this illness is highly underused in most regions. 
In an attempt to find the strategies that are most beneficial in regard to 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost in current environments, the 
purpose of this paper is to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses to investigate 
vaccination strategies in a more economically developed country (MEDC), 
generally known as a "developed" area: the USA, and a less economically 
developed country (LEDC), generally known as a "developing" area: the state of 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study used a dynamic transmission model for 
comparative effectiveness analyses. The model ran two different scenarios. The 
two regions studied have different policies and strategies for Hepatitis A 
vaccination currently, and also used different strategies in 2009. In the USA, a 
universal vaccination policy was modeled, along with a scenario in which it was 
removed. In Rio de Janeiro, a no vaccination policy was modeled, along with a 
scenario in which a universal vaccination policy was effected.
FINDINGS: The comparison of resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
values to accepted threshold values showed universal vaccination to be 
cost-effective in both the USA and Rio de Janeiro as compared to no vaccination. 
When episode and vaccination costs and vaccination efficacy were varied, this 
still remained true. Universal vaccination was found to result in lower 
incidence of Hepatitis A in both the USA and Rio de Janeiro. Over the 
twenty-year time horizon, universal vaccination is projected to prevent 506,945 
cases of symptomatic Hepatitis A in the USA and 42,318 cases of Hepatitis A in 
Rio de Janeiro. Other benefits include a projected increase in cumulative QALYs 
through the use of universal vaccination.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This analysis showed universal vaccination to be 
cost-effective as compared to no vaccination, and portions of the study's 
approach had not previously been applied in tandem to investigate Hepatitis A 
interventions. The results may help foster higher compliance rates for Hepatitis 
A vaccination and even greater per-person economic benefits of universal 
vaccination, particularly in the USA. The purpose of this study is also to 
encourage elevated levels of surveillance on age of infection in developing 
regions and consistent reevaluation utilizing dynamic transmission models in 
both the USA and Brazil, as well as other rapidly developing regions, in order 
to prevent future epidemics and costs associated with the disease.

Despite the increased life expectancy of patients infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), liver disease has emerged as a common cause of 
their morbidity. The liver immunopathology caused by HIV-1 remains elusive. 
Small xenograft animal models with human hepatocytes and human immune system can 
recapitulate the human biology of the disease's pathogenesis. Herein, a protocol 
is described to establish a dual humanized mouse model through human hepatocytes 
and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) transplantation, to study 
liver immunopathology as observed in HIV-infected patients. To achieve dual 
reconstitution, male TK-NOG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Sug Tg(Alb-TK)7-2/ShiJic) 
mice are intraperitoneally injected with ganciclovir (GCV) doses to eliminate 
mouse transgenic liver cells, and with treosulfan for nonmyeloablative 
conditioning, both of which facilitate human hepatocyte (HEP) engraftment and 
human immune system (HIS) development. Human albumin (ALB) levels are evaluated 
for liver engraftment, and the presence of human immune cells in blood detected 
by flow cytometry confirms the establishment of human immune system. The model 
developed using the protocol described here resembles multiple components of 
liver damage from HIV-1 infection. Its establishment could prove to be essential 
for studies of hepatitis virus co-infection and for the evaluation of antiviral 
and antiretroviral drugs.

Japanese General Elderly Population: A Japanese Cohort Survey Randomly Sampled 
from a Basic Resident Registry.

BACKGROUND: The extension of healthy life expectancy has become increasingly 
important because of rising health-care costs and decreases in the quality of 
life in the elderly population. Although reports have surfaced on an association 
between sagittal spinal alignment and physical performance, such studies on the 
healthy population are limited. This study investigated the relationship between 
sagittal spinal alignment and physical function in the general elderly 
population.
METHODS: Registered citizens who were 50 to 89 years of age were targeted for 
this survey. We established 8 groups based on age (50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 
years, 70 to 79 years, and 80 to 89 years) and sex (male and female) after 
random sampling from the resident registry of the town of Obuse in 2014. A total 
of 412 people (203 male and 209 female) were enrolled for the measurement and 
analysis of radiographic parameters of sagittal spinal alignment and physical 
performance tests.
RESULTS: Physical function score values decreased with age, with moderate to 
strong correlations. Within age subgroups, worsened spinal alignment in standing 
whole-spinal radiographs indicated diminished physical performance results. The 
impact of the sagittal vertical axis was especially prominent; as the sagittal 
vertical axis was shifted forward by 1 standard deviation, 1-leg standing time 
became shortened by 3.8 seconds. Two-step scores were significantly associated 
with sagittal vertical axis, global tilt, cervical sagittal vertical axis, and 
pelvic tilt.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation of sagittal spinal alignment on physical function 
in a Japanese elderly cohort revealed significant negative correlations between 
spinal alignment and physical performance after excluding the influence of age 
and sex. Posture change in the community-dwelling elderly population is an 
important sign of physical function impairment.

BACKGROUND: The andropause is associated with declines in serum testosterone 
(T), loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia), and frailty. Two major interventions 
purported to offset sarcopenia are anabolic steroid therapies and resistance 
exercise training (RET). Nonetheless, the efficacy and physiological and 
molecular impacts of T therapy adjuvant to short-term RET remain poorly defined.
METHODS: Eighteen non-hypogonadal healthy older men, 65-75 years, were assigned 
in a random double-blinded fashion to receive, biweekly, either placebo (P, 
saline, n = 9) or T (Sustanon 250 mg, n = 9) injections over 6 week whole-body 
RET (three sets of 8-10 repetitions at 80% one-repetition maximum). Subjects 
underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, ultrasound of vastus lateralis (VL) 
muscle architecture, and knee extensor isometric muscle force tests; VL muscle 
biopsies were taken to quantify myogenic/anabolic gene expression, anabolic 
signalling, muscle protein synthesis (D2 O), and breakdown (extrapolated).
RESULTS: Testosterone adjuvant to RET augmented total fat-free mass (P=0.007), 
legs fat-free mass (P=0.02), and appendicular fat-free mass (P=0.001) gains 
while decreasing total fat mass (P=0.02). Augmentations in VL muscle thickness, 
fascicle length, and quadriceps cross-section area with RET occured to a greater 
extent in T (P < 0.05). Sum strength (P=0.0009) and maximal voluntary contract 
(e.g. knee extension at 70°) (P=0.002) increased significantly more in the T 
group. Mechanistically, both muscle protein synthesis rates (T: 2.13 ± 
0.21%·day-1 vs. P: 1.34 ± 0.13%·day-1 , P=0.0009) and absolute breakdown rates 
(T: 140.2 ± 15.8 g·day-1 vs. P: 90.2 ± 11.7 g·day-1 , P=0.02) were elevated with 
T therapy, which led to higher net turnover and protein accretion in the T group 
(T: 8.3 ± 1.4 g·day-1 vs. P: 1.9 ± 1.2 g·day-1 , P=0.004). Increases in 
ribosomal biogenesis (RNA:DNA ratio); mRNA expression relating to T metabolism 
(androgen receptor: 1.4-fold; Srd5a1: 1.6-fold; AKR1C3: 2.1-fold; and HSD17β3: 
two-fold); insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signalling [IGF-1Ea (3.5-fold) and 
IGF-1Ec (three-fold)] and myogenic regulatory factors; and the activity of 
anabolic signalling (e.g. mTOR, AKT, and RPS6; P < 0.05) were all up-regulated 
with T therapy. Only T up-regulated mitochondrial citrate synthase activity 
(P=0.03) and transcription factor A (1.41 ± 0.2-fold, P=0.0002), in addition to 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1-α mRNA (1.19 ± 
0.21-fold, P=0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of T adjuvant to RET enhanced skeletal muscle mass 
and performance, while up-regulating myogenic gene programming, myocellular 
translational efficiency and capacity, collectively resulting in higher protein 
turnover, and net protein accretion. T coupled with RET is an effective 
short-term intervention to improve muscle mass/function in older non-hypogonadal 
men.

As the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development's Division of Intramural Population Health Research celebrates its 
50th Anniversary, it is appropriate to recognize great achievements in reducing 
child morbidity and mortality and increasing life expectancy. Unfortunately 
large racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health and healthcare disparities persist. 
This commentary suggests a framework to clarify the research and interventions 
needed to eliminate health disparities starting early in the life course.

To What Target Hemoglobin A1c Level Would You Treat This Patient With Type 2 
Diabetes?: Grand Rounds Discussion From Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults-and 25% of those older than 65 
years-have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage 
renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular 
complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common 
and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement 
of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and 
glycemic control. The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D 
is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded 
differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) 
published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In 
addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP 
proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised 
deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 
6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life 
expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation 
from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for 
many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved 
safely. Here, 2 experts, a diabetologist and a general internist, discuss how to 
apply the divergent guideline recommendations to a patient with long-standing 
T2D and a current HbA1c level of 7.8%.

BACKGROUND: Mental illness is the single most common reason for patient visits 
to a general practitioner (GP). Prevalent mental illnesses include major 
depression disorder and dysthymia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders and 
schizophrenia. Patients with severe mental illness have a 10-20-year shorter 
life expectancy when compared with the general population, primarily due to 
physical chronic disease.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a concise update regarding the 
evidence-based clinical lifestyle interventions in the management of both mental 
illnesses and the physical chronic diseases highly prevalent in people with 
mental illness.
DISCUSSION: Growing evidence shows that lifestyle interventions are an effective 
component of management for patients with mental illness to improve mental 
health, physical health and quality of life, which consequently assists in 
reducing the life expectancy gap between patients with severe mental illness and 
the general population. Measures can be taken to improve long-term adherence. 
The GP plays a crucial part in initiating and supporting patients with these 
measures.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with an increased 
risk of death, reducing life expectancy on average between 5 and 7 years. The 
survival time after diagnosis, however, varies considerably as a result of the 
heterogeneity of COPD. Therefore, markers that predict individual survival of 
COPD patients are of great value. We analyzed baseline molecular profiles and 
collected 54 months of follow-up data of the cohort study "COPD and SYstemic 
consequences-COmorbidities NETwork" (COSYCONET). Genome-wide microRNA signatures 
from whole blood collected at time of the inclusion in the study were generated 
for 533 COPD patients including patients that deceased during the 54-month 
follow-up period (n = 53) and patients that survived this period (n = 480). We 
identified two blood-born microRNAs (miR-150-5p and miR-320b) that were highly 
predictive for survival of COPD patients. The expression change was then 
confirmed by RT-qPCR in 245 individuals. Ninety percent of patients with highest 
expression of miR-150-5p survived the 54-month period in contrast to only 50% of 
patients with lowest expression intensity. Moreover, the abundance of the 
oncogenic miR-150-5p in blood of COPD patients was predictive for the 
development of cancer. Thus, molecular profiles measured at the time of a COPD 
diagnosis have a high predictive power for the survival of patients.

An organic coating is commonly used to protect metal from corrosion, but it is 
prone to failure due to microcracks generated by internal stress and external 
mechanical action. The self-healing and self-lubricating achieved in the coating 
is novel, which allows an extension of life by providing resistance to damage 
and repair after damage. In this study, a new approach to microencapsulating 
bifunctional linseed oil with polyurethane shell by interfacial polymerization. 
Moreover, the self-healing and self-lubricating coatings with different 
concentrations of microcapsules were developed. The well-dispersed microcapsules 
showed a regular spherical morphology with an average diameter of ~64.9 μm and a 
core content of 74.0 wt.%. The results of the salt spray test demonstrated that 
coatings containing microcapsules still possess anticorrosion, which is improved 
with the increase of microcapsules content, after being scratched. The results 
of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed a |Z|f=0.01Hz value of 104 
Ω·cm2 for pure epoxy coating after being immersed for 3 days, whereas the 
coating with 20 wt.% microcapsules was the highest, 1010 Ω·cm2. The results of 
friction wear showed that the tribological performance of the coating was 
enhanced greatly as microcapsule concentration reached 10 wt.% or more, which 
showed a 86.8% or more reduction in the friction coefficient compared to the 
pure epoxy coating. These results indicated that the coatings containing 
microcapsules exhibited excellent self-healing and self-lubricating properties, 
which are positively correlated with microcapsules content.

The past six decades have seen remarkable improvements in health outcomes for 
people with cystic fibrosis, which was once a fatal disease of infants and young 
children. However, although life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis has 
increased substantially, the disease continues to limit survival and quality of 
life, and results in a large burden of care for people with cystic fibrosis and 
their families. Furthermore, epidemiological studies in the past two decades 
have shown that cystic fibrosis occurs and is more frequent than was previously 
thought in populations of non-European descent, and the disease is now 
recognised in many regions of the world. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine 
Commission on the future of cystic fibrosis care was established at a time of 
great change in the clinical care of people with the disease, with a growing 
population of adult patients, widespread genetic testing supporting the 
diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, and the development of therapies targeting defects 
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which are 
likely to affect the natural trajectory of the disease. The aim of the 
Commission was to bring to the attention of patients, health-care professionals, 
researchers, funders, service providers, and policy makers the various 
challenges associated with the changing landscape of cystic fibrosis care and 
the opportunities available for progress, providing a blueprint for the future 
of cystic fibrosis care. The discovery of the CFTR gene in the late 1980s 
triggered a surge of basic research that enhanced understanding of the 
pathophysiology and the genotype-phenotype relationships of this clinically 
variable disease. Until recently, available treatments could only control 
symptoms and restrict the complications of cystic fibrosis, but advances in CFTR 
modulator therapies to address the basic defect of cystic fibrosis have been 
remarkable and the field is evolving rapidly. However, CFTR modulators approved 
for use to date are highly expensive, which has prompted questions about the 
affordability of new treatments and served to emphasise the considerable gap in 
health outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis between high-income countries, 
and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Advances in clinical care 
have been multifaceted and include earlier diagnosis through the implementation 
of newborn screening programmes, formalised airway clearance therapy, and 
reduced malnutrition through the use of effective pancreatic enzyme replacement 
and a high-energy, high-protein diet. Centre-based care has become the norm in 
high-income countries, allowing patients to benefit from the skills of expert 
members of multidisciplinary teams. Pharmacological interventions to address 
respiratory manifestations now include drugs that target airway mucus and airway 
surface liquid hydration, and antimicrobial therapies such as antibiotic 
eradication treatment in early-stage infections and protocols for maintenance 
therapy of chronic infections. Despite the recent breakthrough with CFTR 
modulators for cystic fibrosis, the development of novel mucolytic, 
anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective therapies is likely to remain important, 
especially for patients with more advanced stages of lung disease. As the median 
age of patients with cystic fibrosis increases, with a rapid increase in the 
population of adults living with the disease, complications of cystic fibrosis 
are becoming increasingly common. Steps need to be taken to ensure that enough 
highly qualified professionals are present in cystic fibrosis centres to meet 
the needs of ageing patients, and new technologies need to be adopted to support 
communication between patients and health-care providers. In considering the 
future of cystic fibrosis care, the Commission focused on five key areas, which 
are discussed in this report: the changing epidemiology of cystic fibrosis 
(section 1); future challenges of clinical care and its delivery (section 2); 
the building of cystic fibrosis care globally (section 3); novel therapeutics 
(section 4); and patient engagement (section 5). In panel 1, we summarise key 
messages of the Commission. The challenges faced by all stakeholders in building 
and developing cystic fibrosis care globally are substantial, but many 
opportunities exist for improved care and health outcomes for patients in 
countries with established cystic fibrosis care programmes, and in LMICs where 
integrated multidisciplinary care is not available and resources are lacking at 
present. A concerted effort is needed to ensure that all patients with cystic 
fibrosis have access to high-quality health care in the future.

Increasing life expectancy is causing the prevalence of age-related diseases to 
rise, and there is an urgent need for new strategies to improve health at older 
ages. Reduced activity of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) and 
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) nutrient-sensing signaling network can 
extend lifespan and improve health during aging in diverse organisms. However, 
the extensive feedback in this network and adverse side effects of inhibition 
imply that simultaneous targeting of specific effectors in the network may most 
effectively combat the effects of aging. We show that the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) 
inhibitor rapamycin, and the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor 
lithium act additively to increase longevity in Drosophila Remarkably, the 
triple drug combination increased lifespan by 48%. Furthermore, the combination 
of lithium with rapamycin cancelled the latter's effects on lipid metabolism. In 
conclusion, a polypharmacology approach of combining established, prolongevity 
drug inhibitors of specific nodes may be the most effective way to target the 
nutrient-sensing network to improve late-life health.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use Microsoft Excel spreadsheet 
software to fit parametric survival distributions. We also explain the 
differences between individual patient data (IPD) and survival data 
reconstructed in Excel and SAS.
METHODS: Three sets of patient data on overall survival were compared using 
different methods: 'original' IPD, 'reconstructed SAS', and 'reconstructed 
Excel'. The best-fit distribution was selected using visual observation, 
supported by linear plots of predicted probabilities, goodness-of-fit 
coefficients, and the sum of squared error of prediction. Outcomes included the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net benefit (INB), 
incremental cost, and life-years gained over short-term and lifetime horizons. 
These were compared for different data sets.
RESULTS: In this example, log-normal, log-logistic, and Weibull distributions 
showed best-fit with the visual tests and goodness-of-fit statistics. Weibull 
and exponential distributions showed significant differences compared with IPD 
data. Data on short-term (5 years) time horizons produced by different data 
re-creation methods showed closeness with data reconstructed from SAS. The ICER 
and INB results were dependent on the time horizon and selected parametric 
distribution from the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Different approaches used in fitting parametric survival 
distributions yielded predicted probabilities that substantially differed from 
those using original IPD. Our study highlights the importance of following 
guidelines for economic evaluations with a systematic approach to parametric 
survival analysis techniques in order to select best fitting parametric survival 
distributions.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of palliative care team (PCT) 
consultation for patients with cancer who are admitted in hospital and to 
investigate when and why PCTs are consulted.
METHODS: In this descriptive study in ten Dutch hospitals, the COMPASS study, we 
compared characteristics of patients with cancer for whom a PCT was or was not 
consulted (substudy 1). We also collected information about the process of PCT 
consultations and the disciplines involved (substudy 2).
RESULTS: In substudy 1, we included 476 patients. A life expectancy <3 months, 
unplanned hospitalisation and lack of options for anti-cancer treatment 
increased the likelihood of PCT consultation. In substudy 2, 64% of 550 
consultations concerned patients with a life expectancy of <3 months. The most 
frequently mentioned problems that were identified by the PCTS were complex pain 
problems (56%), issues around the organisation of care (31%), fatigue (27%) and 
dyspnoea (27%). There was much variance between hospitals in the disciplines 
that were involved in consultations.
CONCLUSION: Palliative care teams in Dutch hospitals are most often consulted 
for patients with a life expectancy of <3 months who have an unplanned hospital 
admission because of physical symptoms or problems. We found much variance 
between hospitals in the composition and activities of PCTs.

INTRODUCTION: Many factors influence the nursing needs and survival of nursing 
home residents, including the admission criteria. The aim of the study was to 
compare health, survival and predictors for one- and two-year survival of people 
entering Icelandic nursing homes between 2003-2007 and 2008-2014.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, descriptive, comparative study. The data 
was obtained from a Directorate of Health database for all interRAI assessments 
of Icelandic nursing homes from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014 (N = 
8487).
RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the health and survival of new 
nursing home residents before and after December 31, 2007. In the latter period, 
the mean age was 82.7 years. In the previous period, it was 82.1 years, and the 
prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, 
diabetes and COPD increased between the periods. One-year survival decreased 
from 73.4% to 66.5%, and two-year survival decreased from 56.9% to 49.1%. The 
strongest mortality risk factors were heart failure and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, as well as high scores on the CHESS scale and ADL long scale.
CONCLUSION: After 2007, new residents were older, in poorer health, and their 
life expectancy was shorter than for those moving to nursing homes before that. 
The results suggest that the aim of the regulatory change was achieved, i.e., to 
prioritise those in worst health. Their care needs may therefore be different 
and greater than before.

Background: Forensic psychiatric patients are known to have reduced life 
expectancy. The aim of this study was to explore to what extent substance abuse 
disorders account for this increased mortality. Methods: Data up to December 31, 
2016 for mortality (causes of death register) and substance abuse (forensic 
psychiatric examinations) were collected for all of the 950 patients committed 
to involuntary forensic psychiatric hospital care in Finland during 1980-2009 
and discharged no later than December 31, 2016. Patients were then classified as 
suffering or not suffering from substance abuse disorders and their causes of 
death were examined. The standardized mortality ratio was then calculated for 
these groups on the basis of sex-, age-, and calendar-period-specific mortality 
rates for the general Finnish population. Results: During the follow-up time 
(mean 13.4 years), 354 (320 men, 34 women) patients died, resulting in a 
standardized mortality ratio of 3.5. The standardized mortality ratio for the 
patients with a history of substance abuse disorders was 4.1 compared to 2.8 for 
those with no such history. Among men, but not women, the age-adjusted 
proportion of death was significantly higher for those with a history of 
substance abuse disorders. In addition, in patients with a history of substance 
abuse disorders, the male age-adjusted competing risk of mortality was higher 
for unnatural causes, but not natural causes. Furthermore, a prominent 
proportion (16%) of all deaths and a majority of the accidental deaths (64%) 
occurred under the influence of some substance. Conclusions: Substance abuse is 
a major factor causing excessive mortality among forensic psychiatric patients. 
The management of substance abuse problems should be one cornerstone of the 
treatment of patients with both severe mental disorders and substance abuse 
disorders during their time in hospital and this should be extended to 
outpatient care.

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide, with 
significant morbidity and associated costs. Treatment allocation depends on the 
stage of diagnosis; however, resource utilization can be significant across all 
stages. We aimed to summarize the available data on the cost effectiveness of 
surveillance of and treatments for HCC in the context of current treatment 
guidelines. We performed a focused review of studies investigating the economic 
burden and cost effectiveness of HCC surveillance treatment modalities published 
between January 2000 and January 2019. The overall economic burden of HCC is 
increasing in the USA and in several countries worldwide due to its rising 
incidence and the proliferation of therapies. Liver transplantation is a 
cost-effective strategy for early-stage HCC treatment in selected patients. In 
settings where liver transplantation is not available or in patients awaiting 
transplant, ablative or locoregional therapies are cost effective with increases 
in quality-adjusted life-years. First-line therapy with sorafenib for advanced 
stage HCC is cost effective in the treatment of compensated cirrhosis. The cost 
effectiveness of recently approved systemic therapies for advanced HCC require 
further investigation. Existing studies have shown that guideline-recommended 
surveillance techniques and several available therapies for the treatment of HCC 
are cost effective; however, there are limitations in the literature, including 
reliance on suboptimal modeling with incomplete/simplified model structure or 
inadequate inputs. With increasing therapeutic options in patients with HCC, 
understanding their relative value is critical in designing HCC treatment 
algorithms.

Patterned neuronal cell cultures are important tools for investigating neuronal 
signal integration, network function, and cell-substrate interactions. Because 
of the variable nature of neuronal cells, the widely used coating method of 
microcontact printing is in constant need of improvements and adaptations 
depending on the pattern, cell type, and coating solutions available for a 
certain experimental system. In this work, we report on three approaches to 
modify microcontact printing on borosilicate glass surfaces, which we evaluate 
with contact angle measurements and by determining the quality of patterned 
neuronal growth. Although background toxification with manganese salt does not 
result in the desired pattern enhancement, a simple heat treatment of the glass 
substrates leads to improved background hydrophobicity and therefore neuronal 
patterning. Thirdly, we extended a microcontact printing process based on 
covalently linking the glass surface and the coating molecule via an 
epoxysilane. This extension is an additional hydrophobization step with 
dodecylamine. We demonstrate that shelf life of the silanized glass is at least 
22 weeks, leading to consistently reliable neuronal patterning by microcontact 
printing. Thus, we compared three practical additions to microcontact printing, 
two of which can easily be implemented into a workflow for the investigation of 
patterned neuronal networks.
