AIM: Ikaria Island (North-East Aegean, Greece) has been recognized as one of the 
places with the highest life expectancy around the world (the Blues Zones). Risk 
factors in relation to 4-year all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) incidence in elders were studied.
METHODS: From June to October 2009, 330 men and 343 women, aged 65 to 100 years, 
were enrolled, and in June to July 2013, they were reevaluated.
RESULTS: Age-standardized, gender-specific, all-cause mortality rate was 790 
deaths per 10 000 inhabitants, and causes of death were CVD (36%), cancer (21%), 
infection (10%), respiratory disease (2%), and other (31%). Incidence of CVDwas 
520 cases per 10 000 men inhabitants and 320 cases per 10 000 women (P = .03). 
Age, male gender, heart rate, urea levels, left atrial maximum volume, left 
ventricular hypertrophy, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and moderate to severe 
depression were positively associated with mortality, whereas left ventricular 
ejection fraction as well as coffee and tea drinking, fruit intake, and 
exclusive olive oil use were inversely associated with CVD.
CONCLUSION: Heart function markers in addition to antioxidant dietary factors 
were placed in this puzzle of CVD morbidity.

The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) has become a widely used measure of health 
outcomes for use in informing decision making in health technology assessment. 
However, there is growing recognition of outcomes beyond health within the 
health sector and in related sectors such as social care and public health. This 
paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of ten possible approaches 
covering extending the health-related QALY and using well-being and 
monetary-based methods, in order to address the problem of using multiple 
outcome measures to inform resource allocation within and between sectors.

The worldwide prevalence of dementia is predicted to rise significantly in the 
next three decades. However, these projections have not taken into account the 
role of modifiable risk factors and whether any prevention strategies might 
influence the predicted trend. Attempts at pharmacological disease modification 
have largely been disappointing, and the difficulties in conducting dementia 
trials are reviewed here. In contrast, recent population studies in high-income 
countries suggest that the epidemiology may be changing with a possible decline 
in incident dementia, or even a reduction in age-specific prevalence. Therefore, 
efforts to develop public health interventions may prove to be the more 
successful approach to addressing dementia at a societal level.

BACKGROUND: Although the radial forearm free flap (RFF) is a commonly used 
microvascular graft for head and neck reconstruction, long-term biomechanical 
results regarding donor site morbidity are rare.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective panel study, 32 patients were included. 
Biomechanical assessment was performed preoperatively, three months 
postoperatively and two years postoperatively. The primary endpoint of the study 
was grip strength. In addition, the Mayo wrist score, DASH score (disabilities 
of the arm, shoulder and hand score), fine motor skill strengths (tip pinch, key 
pinch, palmar pinch) and the range of motion were analysed. Primary defects were 
closed with local full-thickness skin grafts (FTSG) from the donor site forearm 
avoiding a secondary defect site.
RESULTS: In the long-term analysis, grip strength was reduced in both arms. A 
significant improvement over time was found only for the donor arm. A persistent 
deficit of tip pinch strength and dorsal extension was recorded. Persistent 
sensory limitations occurred in four cases. Patient contentment after two years 
of follow-up was high and daily life routine was not restricted.
CONCLUSION: Gross and fine motor skill limitations are reversible short-term 
effects after RFF harvesting and do not restrict daily routine in the long term. 
These findings substantiate the value of the RFF as a workhorse in 
reconstructive surgery.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are important sources of 
information on the benefits and harms patients may expect from treatment 
options. The aim of this structured literature review by the German Institute 
for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care was to explore whether and how the 
end-of-life (EoL) situation of patients with advanced cancer is considered in 
RCTs investigating anti-cancer treatments.
METHODS: Our journal pool comprised 19 medical journals, namely five preselected 
key general medical journals as well as 14 specialist journals (mainly cancer) 
identified via a scoping search. We systematically searched these journals in 
MEDLINE to identify RCTs investigating anti-cancer treatments for the following 
four cancer types: glioblastoma, lung cancer (stage IIIb-IV), malignant melanoma 
(stage IV), and pancreatic cancer (search via OVID; November 2012). We selected 
a representative sample of 100 publications, that is, the 25 most recent 
publications for each cancer type. EoL was defined as a life expectancy of ≤ two 
years. We assessed the information provided on (1) the descriptions of the 
terminal stage of the disease, (2) the therapeutic goal (i.e. the intended 
therapeutic benefit of the intervention studied), (3) the study endpoints 
assessed, (4) the authors' concluding appraisal of the intervention's effects, 
and (5) the terminology referring to the patients' EoL situation.
RESULTS: Median survival was ≤ one year for each of the four cancer types. 
Descriptions of the terminal stage of the disease were ambiguous or lacking in 
29/100 publications. One or more therapeutic goals were mentioned in 51/100 
publications; these goals were patient-relevant in 38 publications (survival 
alone: 30/38; health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or HRQoL and survival: 
6/38; symptom control or symptom control and survival: 2/38). Primary endpoints 
included survival (50%), surrogates (44%), and safety (3%). Patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) were assessed in 36/100 RCTs. The implications of 
treatment-related harms for the patients were discussed in 22/100 appraisals. 
Terminology referring to the patients' EoL situation (e.g. "terminal") was 
scarce, whereas terms suggesting control of the disease (e.g. "cancer control") 
were common.
CONCLUSIONS: The EoL situation of patients with advanced cancer should be more 
carefully considered in clinical trials. Although the investigation and robust 
reporting of PROs is a prerequisite for informed decision-making in healthcare, 
they are rarely defined as endpoints and HRQoL is rarely mentioned as a 
therapeutic goal. Suggestions for improving standards for study design and 
reporting are presented.

BACKGROUND: The cost of interferon-free combination therapies remains high to 
provide widespread access to treatment, regardless of fibrosis stage.
AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of simeprevir/daclatasvir (SMV/DCV) 
therapy in treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis C genotype-1b patients with 
moderate fibrosis.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the natural history of chronic 
hepatitis C progression. The model estimated lifetime healthcare costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for a cohort of patients from the Spanish 
National Healthcare System perspective. The cost-effectiveness threshold 
considered was €40,000/QALY. The treatment strategies analyzed were SMV/DCV, 
peginterferon/ribavirin/telaprevir, and peginterferon/ribavirin/boceprevir. A 
sensitivity analysis was carried out.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the SMV/DCV strategy were 
€23,774/QALY and €28,524/QALY compared with that of telaprevir or boceprevir 
triple therapy, respectively, for genotype-1b patients with moderate fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: SMV/DCV combination compared with the standard of care previous to 
the arrival of second-generation direct-acting antivirals fell below generally 
accepted willingness-to-pay threshold. Results obtained should be supported by 
ongoing clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD), assessed by preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) and serum creatinine (Cr), on postoperative outcomes and long-term 
survival in asymptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: We examined data about patients that underwent CEA between January 2002 
and September 2014 in our Institution. Retrospective analysis to assess 
preoperative comorbidities and postoperative complications was performed. 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula was used to calculate eGFR. 
Patients were divided into four groups based on values of preoperative eGFR: 
group A (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2), group B (89-60 mL/min/1.73 m2), group C (59-30 
mL/min/1.73 m2) and group D (≤29 mL/min/1.73 m2), and into two groups based on 
preoperative Cr values: group 1 (<1.5 mg/dL) and group 2 (≥1.5 mg/dL). Primary 
outcomes were death or the development of one or more postoperative major 
complications within 30 days after surgery, for each group. Survival curves of 
Kaplan-Meier were plotted for each group of patients to assess long-term 
mortality.
RESULTS: During the study period, 853 CEAs in 808 patients were performed, of 
which 682 CEA in 645 patients for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. 
Symptomatic patients (19.58%) and patients receiving hemodialysis (0.46%) were 
excluded. Among CEAs analyzed, 678 (99.4%) had preoperative Cr values recorded 
and 637 (93.4%) had preoperative eGFR values recorded. The number of patients in 
each group according to eGFR values was 84 (13.2%) for group A, 250 (39.3%) for 
group B, 271 (42.5%) for group C and 32 (5.0%) for group D; according to Cr 
values was 609 (89.8%) for group 1 and 69 (10.2%) for group 2. One death and 24 
(3.52%) postoperative major complications, of which 20 postoperative 
neurological events (NE) and 4 postoperative myocardial infarctions (MI), 
occurred within 30 days after surgery. The median follow-up was 55 months (IQR 
27-84). Regarding general population, multivariate analysis with age found no 
significant correlation between Cr and primary outcomes, to the contrary of eGFR 
(OR=1.02; CI: 1.01-1.02; P<0.0001). No significant differences were observed 
concerning primary outcomes according to eGFR and Cr groups. Five-year survival 
rates for groups A, B, C and D were 98±0.02%, 90±0.02%, 80±0.03% and 56±0.12% 
respectively (P<0.0001) and 88±0.02% and 62±0.08% for group 1 and 2 respectively 
(P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: eGFR and Cr classes are not a dependable method in evaluating 
postoperative complications risk after CEA in asymptomatic patients, although 
preoperative eGFR values influence 30-days morbility. Both eGFR and Cr groups 
are reliable predictors to discriminate among asymptomatic patients candidates 
for CEA, based on their life expectancy.

extension activity of Sir2 in yeast.

Silent information regulator 2 (Sir2), an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, 
has been proposed to be a longevity factor that plays important roles in dietary 
restriction (DR)-mediated lifespan extension. In this study, we show that the 
Sir2's role for DR-mediated lifespan extension depends on cAMP-PKA and casein 
kinase 2 (CK2) signaling in yeast. Sir2 partially represses the transcription of 
lifespan-associated genes, such as PMA1 (encoding an H(+)-ATPase) and many 
ribosomal protein genes, through deacetylation of Lys 16 of histone H4 in the 
promoter regions of these genes. This repression is relieved by Sir2 S473 
phosphorylation, which is mediated by active cAMP-PKA and CK2 signaling. 
Moderate DR increases the replicative lifespan of wild-type yeast but has no 
effect on that of yeast expressing the Sir2-S473E or S473A allele, suggesting 
that the effect of Sir2 on DR-mediated lifespan extension is negatively 
regulated by S473 phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which 
Sir2 contributes to lifespan extension.

BACKGROUND: Bernese mountain dogs are reported to have a shorter life expectancy 
than other breeds. A major reason for this has been assigned to a high tumour 
prevalence, especially of histiocytic sarcoma. The efforts made by the breeding 
clubs to improve the longevity with the help of genetic tests and breeding value 
estimations are impeded by insufficiently reliable diagnoses regarding the cause 
of death. The current standard for post mortem examination in animals is 
performance of an autopsy. In human forensic medicine, imaging modalities, such 
as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are used with increasing 
frequency as a complement to autopsy. The present study investigates, whether 
post mortem computed tomography in combination with core needle biopsy is able 
to provide a definitive diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. For this purpose we 
have analysed the results of post mortem computed tomography and core needle 
biopsy in eleven Bernese mountain dogs. In the subsequent autopsy, every dog had 
a definitive diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma, based on immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Computed tomography revealed space-occupying lesions in all dogs. 
Lesion detection by post mortem computed tomography was similar to lesion 
detection in autopsy for lung tissue (9 cases in computed tomography / 8 cases 
in autopsy), thoracic lymph nodes (9/8), spleen (6/7), kidney (2/2) and bone 
(3/3). Hepatic nodules, however, were difficult to detect with our scanning 
protocol (2/7). Histology of the core needle biopsies provided definitive 
diagnoses of histiocytic sarcoma in ten dogs, including confirmation by 
immunohistochemistry in six dogs. The biopsy samples of the remaining dog did 
not contain any identifiable neoplastic cells. Autolysis was the main reason for 
uncertain histological diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Post mortem computed tomography is a fast and effective method for 
the detection of lesions suspicious for histiocytic sarcoma in pulmonary, 
thoracic lymphatic, splenic, osseous and renal tissue. Optimization of the 
procedure regarding the scanning protocol and tissue sample size and number will 
improve the accuracy of the method.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder caused 
by a de novo genetic mutation that leads to the accumulation of a splicing 
isoform of lamin A termed progerin. Progerin expression alters the organization 
of the nuclear lamina and chromatin. The life expectancy of HGPS patients is 
severely reduced due to critical cardiovascular defects. Progerin also 
accumulates in an age-dependent manner in the vascular cells of adults that do 
not carry genetic mutations associated with HGPS. The molecular mechanisms that 
lead to vascular dysfunction in HGPS may therefore also play a role in vascular 
aging. The vascular phenotypic and molecular changes observed in HGPS are 
strikingly similar to those seen with age, including increased senescence, 
altered mechanotransduction and stem cell exhaustion. This article discusses the 
similarities and differences between age-dependent and HGPS-related vascular 
aging to highlight the relevance of HGPS as a model for vascular aging. Induced 
pluripotent stem cells derived from HGPS patients are suggested as an attractive 
model to study vascular aging in order to develop novel approaches to treat 
cardiovascular disease.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive, life-limiting muscle-wasting 
disease. Although no curative treatment is yet available, comprehensive 
multidisciplinary care has increased life expectancy significantly in recent 
decades. An international consensus care publication in 2010 outlined 
best-practice care, which includes corticosteroid treatment, respiratory, 
cardiac, orthopedic and rehabilitative interventions to address disease 
manifestations. While disease specialists are largely aware of these care 
standards, local physicians responsible for the day-to-day care of patients and 
families may be less familiar. To facilitate optimal care, a one-page document 
has been generated from published care recommendations, summarizing the key 
elements of comprehensive care for people living with DMD ("Imperatives for 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy). This document was developed through an 
international collaboration between Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), 
United Parent Projects Muscular Dystrophy (UPPMD) and TREAT-NMD.

Indirect evidence suggests that improved insulin sensitivity may contribute to 
improved lifespan of mice in which aging has been slowed by mutations, drugs, or 
dietary means, even in stocks of mice that do not show signs of late-life 
diabetes. Peripheral responses to insulin can be augmented by overexpression of 
Syntaxin 4 (Syn4), a plasma-membrane-localized SNARE protein. We show here that 
Syn4 transgenic (Tg) mice with high level expression of Syn4 had a significant 
extension of lifespan (33% increase in median) and showed increased peripheral 
insulin sensitivity, even at ages where controls exhibited age-related insulin 
resistance. Moreover, skeletal muscle GLUT4 and islet insulin granule exocytosis 
processes were fully protected in Syn4 Tg mice challenged with a high-fat diet. 
Hence, high-level expressing Syn4 Tg mice may exert better glycemic control, 
which slows multiple aspects of aging and extends lifespan, even in non-diabetic 
mice.

Age is the strongest risk factor for many diseases including neurodegenerative 
disorders, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer. Due to increasing 
life expectancy and low birth rates, the incidence of age-related diseases is 
increasing in industrialized countries. Therefore, understanding the 
relationship between diseases and aging and facilitating healthy aging are major 
goals in medical research. In the last decades, the dimension of biological data 
has drastically increased with high-throughput technologies now measuring 
thousands of (epi) genetic, expression and metabolic variables. The most common 
and so far successful approach to the analysis of these data is the so-called 
reductionist approach. It consists of separately testing each variable for 
association with the phenotype of interest such as age or age-related disease. 
However, a large portion of the observed phenotypic variance remains unexplained 
and a comprehensive understanding of most complex phenotypes is lacking. Systems 
biology aims to integrate data from different experiments to gain an 
understanding of the system as a whole rather than focusing on individual 
factors. It thus allows deeper insights into the mechanisms of complex traits, 
which are caused by the joint influence of several, interacting changes in the 
biological system. In this review, we look at the current progress of applying 
omics technologies to identify biomarkers of aging. We then survey existing 
systems biology approaches that allow for an integration of different types of 
data and highlight the need for further developments in this area to improve 
epidemiologic investigations.

The life expectancy of adults with mental illness is worse than that of the 
general population and is largely due to poor physical health status. Physical 
activity has been consistently recommended for the prevention and management of 
many chronic physical health conditions and can also have benefits for mental 
health. This cross sectional study assessed the attitudes towards and 
preferences for physical activity among inpatient adults with mental illness, 
and differences by distress and gender. Self-report questionnaires were 
completed by 101 patients. Findings indicated that inpatient adults with mental 
illness are interested in doing physical activity while in hospital, primarily 
to maintain good physical health and improve emotional wellbeing. Fewer than 
half of participants agreed that physical activity has benefits for serious 
mental illness. Participants indicated a preference for walking and physical 
activity that can be done alone, at a fixed time and with a set routine and 
format. Major barriers were fatigue and lack of motivation. Females were more 
likely than males to prefer activities done with others of the same gender 
(P = 0.001) and at the same level of ability (P < 0.001). There were no 
significant differences by level of distress. These findings can inform physical 
activity intervention programming in hospital settings, which may contribute to 
decreasing the chronic disease burden and improve the psychological wellbeing in 
adults with mental illness.

BACKGROUND: This retrospective study evaluates efficacy and tolerability of 
high-dose hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) in patients with head and neck 
cancer.
METHODS: All patients with head and neck cancer treated between September 2003 
and September 2013 with 12 × 4 Gy RT were included. Two and 3D-RT or 
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) were used. Overall survival (OS), tumor 
response, and palliative effect were evaluated.
RESULTS: Palliative effect occurred in 63% of 81 included patients, lasted a 
median of 4.6 months, and was correlated with tumor response (p = .006). Median 
OS was 7.2 months. Confluent mucositis occurred more often in patients treated 
with 2D/3D-RT than IMRT (26% vs 44%; p = .04) and lasted for a median of 2 
weeks.
CONCLUSION: High-dose hypofractionated RT resulted in meaningful palliation in 
63%, lasting for almost 5 months. IMRT should be the technique of choice, as it 
results in less high-grade toxicity. The 12 × 4 schedule should be opted for 
patients with reasonable functional capacities and a life expectancy of >6 
months. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E1264-E1270, 2016.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with metastatic melanomas that harbour 
BRAF V600E or V600K mutations with trametinib plus dabrafenib appears to be 
superior to treatment with vemurafenib alone. This treatment regimen is likely 
to become available in Switzerland in the near future.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of trametinib plus dabrafenib.
METHODS: A Markov cohort simulation was conducted to model the clinical course 
of typical patients with metastatic melanoma. Information on response rates, 
clinical condition and follow-up treatments were derived and transition 
probabilities estimated based on the results of a clinical trial that compared 
treatment with trametinib plus dabrafenib vs. vemurafenib alone.
RESULTS: Treatment with trametinib plus dabrafenib was estimated to cost an 
additional CHF199 647 (Swiss francs) on average and yield a gain of 0·52 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF385 603 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses showed that a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF100 000 per QALY would 
not be reached at the current US price of trametinib.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of trametinib in Switzerland at US market prices 
for the treatment of metastatic BRAF V600-mutated melanoma with trametinib plus 
dabrafenib is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with vemurafenib 
monotherapy. A reduction in the total price of the combination therapy is 
required to achieve an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio for this clinically 
promising treatment.

Life Expectancy Can Explain the Precocity-Longevity Hypothesis Association of 
Early Career Success and Early Death.

McCann SJ(1).

Author information:
(1)a Cape Breton University , Canada.

The precocity-longevity hypothesis that those who reach career milestones 
earlier in life have shorter life spans was tested with the 430 men elected to 
serve in the House of Representatives for the 71st U.S. Congress in 1929-1930 
who were alive throughout 1930. There was no tendency for those first serving at 
an earlier age to die sooner or those serving first at a later age to die later 
than expected based on individual life expectancy in 1930. Although age at first 
serving was correlated with death age, the correlation was not significant when 
expected death age was controlled. The results cast serious doubt on the 
contention of the precocity-longevity hypothesis that the developmental aspects 
of the prerequisites, concomitants, and consequences of early career achievement 
peaks actively enhance the conditions for an earlier death.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy in developed countries is continuously increasing. 
Hence elderly patients are becoming more common in our clinical practice. 
Currently, one of the greatest challenges of medicine is balancing the life 
expectancy of elderly patients against aggressive treatments that carry 
significant risks.
OBJECTIVE: To outline the complications and survival in surgical patients 
80 years and over undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A review of a radical cystectomy in elderly recorded in 
four different institutional prospective databases during the period between 
1991 and 2014. Clinical and pathologic features, complications and survival were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were available. Median (range) age 82.2 
(80-89) years. Seventeen women and 94 men. Regarding the ASA score, 6 patients 
were ASA I, 47 patients were ASA II, 49 patients ASA III and 9 ASA IV. Prior to 
surgery, 48 patients had hydronephrosis. The median (range) creatinine series 
was 1.1 (0.71-11.1) ng/dL. In 88 cases an ileal conduit was performed, 17 a 
cutaneous ureterostomy diversion, 5 neobladders and 1 ureterosigmoidostomy case. 
The median (range) operative time was 230 (120-420) min and a total of 97 
patients required blood transfusion. The median (range) hospital stay was 14 
(7-126) days. The early and late complication rates were 50.4% and 32%, 
respectively. A total of 14 patients (12.6%) required surgical reintervention. 
Eight patients (7.2%) died in the immediate postoperative period. The 
readmission rate of the series was 27.2%. The mean follow-up of the series was 
18 (0.27-134.73) months. During this period 66 patients died, 52 of them due to 
the tumor. Twelve month tumour progression free survival was 83.9% for ≤pT1, 
70.2% for pT2 and 36% for ≥pT3, respectively. Twelve month cancer specific 
survival was 85.6% for ≤pT1, 75.1% for pT2 and 42.5% for ≥pT3, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Radical cystectomy in elderly population is an aggressive surgical 
treatment with a significant complication rate, hospital readmission and 
perioperative mortality rate. Careful selection of patients is essential in 
order to minimize the complications of this surgery and balance benefits against 
risks in the elderly population. Tumour progression and cancer specific survival 
are poor for patients with ≥pT3 disease. Alternatives such as tri-modality 
therapy need to be considered within a multi-disciplinary approach. More data is 
required to determine which sub-groups of elderly patients would benefit from a 
complication, survival and quality of life perspective.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasms (GTN) are proliferative degenerative 
disorders of placental elements and include complete or partial mole (90%), 
invasivemole (5-8%), choriocarcinoma (1-2%) and placental site tumor (1-2%). 
Chorioadenoma destruens is a trophoblastic tumor, characterized by myometrial 
invasion through direct extension or via venous channels. We present a case of 
invasive mole eroding uterus and uterine vasculature, causing sudden rupture of 
uterus with massive haemoperitoneum mimicking ectopic pregnancy. A 20 year old 
G1P0 at 6 weeks gestation presented in Casualty of Kasturba Hospital complaining 
of severe acute onset lower abdominal pain for one hour. Clinical examination 
revealed shock. Sonography suggested ectopic pregnancy and immediate exploratory 
laparotomy was decided. On laparotomy, 2000cc of haemoperitoneum was noted. 
Grape like vesicles protruding through fundal perforation with profuse active 
bleeding was seen. Bleeding persisted despite evacuation. Step wise uterine 
devascularisation failed to achieve haemostasis. Total abdominal hysterectomy 
was performed as a life saving measure.

A focus group process, conducted by a community-academic partnership, 
qualitatively assessed food insecurity perspectives of parents and community 
staff assisting families with food assistance. Food insecurity was reported to 
affect all aspects of their life, increasing stress and reducing coping 
abilities. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality encourages research 
with priority populations, including low-income populations. This research 
supports the body of knowledge correlating relationships between poverty, food 
insecurity, and chronic health conditions. Perspectives of food-insecure people 
are often missing from policy and advocacy interventions. Nurses can use lessons 
learned and recommendations from this research to address 
food-insecurity-related health disparities.

Endovascular Versus Open Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Best Decision.

Since the first implantation of an endograft in 1991, endovascular aneurysm 
repair (EVAR) rapidly gained recognition. Historical trials showed lower early 
mortality rates but these results were not maintained beyond 4 years. Despite 
newer-generation devices, higher rates of reintervention are associated with 
EVAR during follow-up. Therefore, the best therapeutic decision relies on many 
parameters that the physician has to take in consideration. Patient's 
preferences and characteristics are important, especially age and life 
expectancy besides health status. Aneurysmal anatomical conditions remain 
probably the most predictive factor that should be carefully evaluated to offer 
the best treatment. Unfavorable anatomy has been observed to be associated with 
more complications especially endoleak, leading to more re-interventions and 
higher risk of late mortality. Nevertheless, technological advances have made 
surgeons move forward beyond the set barriers. Thus, more endografts are 
implanted outside the instructions for use despite excellent results after open 
repair especially in low-risk patients. When debating about AAA repair, some 
other crucial points should be analysed. It has been shown that strict 
surveillance is mandatory after EVAR to offer durable results and prevent late 
rupture. Such program is associated with additional costs and with increased 
risk of radiation. Moreover, a risk of loss of renal function exists when 
repetitive imaging and secondary procedures are required. The aim of this 
article is to review the data associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm and its 
treatment in order to establish selection criteria to decide between open or 
endovascular repair.

Predictors of Response to Web-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With 
High-Intensity Face-to-Face Therapist Guidance for Depression: A Bayesian 
Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated the effect of guided 
Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for depression. However, ICBT 
is not suitable for all depressed patients and there is a considerable level of 
nonresponse. Research on predictors and moderators of outcome in ICBT is 
inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: This paper explored predictors of response to an intervention 
combining the Web-based program MoodGYM and face-to-face therapist guidance in a 
sample of primary care patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.
METHODS: Participants (N=106) aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from 
primary care and randomly allocated to a treatment condition or to a delayed 
treatment condition. The intervention included the Norwegian version of the 
MoodGYM program, face-to-face guidance from a psychologist, and reminder emails. 
In this paper, data from the treatment phase of the 2 groups was merged to 
increase the sample size (n=82). Outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms 
during treatment as assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). 
Predictors included demographic variables, severity variables (eg, number of 
depressive episodes and pretreatment depression and anxiety severity), cognitive 
variables (eg, dysfunctional thinking), module completion, and treatment 
expectancy and motivation. Using Bayesian analysis, predictors of response were 
explored with a latent-class approach and by analyzing whether predictors 
affected the slope of response.
RESULTS: A 2-class model distinguished well between responders (74%, 61/82) and 
nonresponders (26%, 21/82). Our results indicate that having had more depressive 
episodes, being married or cohabiting, and scoring higher on a measure of life 
satisfaction had high odds for positively affecting the probability of response. 
Higher levels of dysfunctional thinking had high odds for a negative effect on 
the probability of responding. Prediction of the slope of response yielded 
largely similar results. Bayes factors indicated substantial evidence that being 
married or cohabiting predicted a more positive treatment response. The effects 
of life satisfaction and number of depressive episodes were more uncertain. 
There was substantial evidence that several variables were unrelated to 
treatment response, including gender, age, and pretreatment symptoms of 
depression and anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment response to ICBT with face-to-face guidance may be 
comparable across varying levels of depressive severity and irrespective of the 
presence and severity of comorbid anxiety. Being married or cohabiting, 
reporting higher life satisfaction, and having had more depressive episodes may 
predict a more favorable response, whereas higher levels of dysfunctional 
thinking may be a predictor of poorer response. More studies exploring 
predictors and moderators of Internet-based treatments are needed to inform for 
whom this treatment is most effective.
