The review aims to summarise evidence addressing patients' values, preferences 
and practical issues on deciding between transcatheter aortic valve insertion 
(TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for aortic stenosis. We 
searched databases and grey literature until June 2020. We included studies of 
adults with aortic stenosis eliciting values and preferences about treatment, 
excluding medical management or palliative care. Qualitative findings were 
synthesised using thematic analysis, and quantitative findings were narratively 
described. Evidence certainty was assessed using CERQual (Confidence in the 
Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) and GRADE (Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We included eight 
studies. Findings ranged from low to very low certainty. Most studies only 
addressed TAVI. Studies addressing both TAVI and SAVR reported on factors 
affecting patients' decision-making along with treatment effectiveness, instead 
of trade-offs between procedures. Willingness to accept risk varied 
considerably. To improve their health status, participants were willing to 
accept higher mortality risk than current evidence suggests for either 
procedure. No study explicitly addressed valve reintervention, and one study 
reported variability in willingness to accept shorter duration of known 
effectiveness of TAVI compared with SAVR. The most common themes were desire for 
symptom relief and improved function. Participants preferred minimally invasive 
procedures with shorter hospital stay and recovery. The current body of evidence 
on patients' values, preferences and practical issues related to aortic stenosis 
management is of suboptimal rigour and reports widely disparate results 
regarding patients' perceptions. These findings emphasise the need for higher 
quality studies to inform clinical practice guidelines and the central 
importance of shared decision-making to individualise care fitted to each 
patient.

BACKGROUND: A value set for the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D)-Y in Slovenia is 
not yet available, making the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
for children and adolescents using this generic instrument impossible.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of our study was to obtain adult preferences 
towards EQ-5D-Y health states in Slovenia, following the EQ-5D-Y-3L 
international valuation protocol. The adults were asked to take the perspective 
of a hypothetical 10-year-old child.
METHOD: A sample of 1074 adults in Slovenia completed an online discrete-choice 
experiment (DCE) survey on EQ-5D-Y health states. The latent scale issue was 
addressed by obtaining the value of the anchor (33333) with 200 composite time 
trade-off (cTTO) interviews. A mixed (random coefficients) logit model was used 
to estimate the value set.
RESULTS: All the estimated coefficients of the mixed logit model were 
statistically significant at the 1% level and had an expected negative sign. The 
most important health dimension in EQ-5D-Y is pain/discomfort, followed by 
anxiety/depression, usual activities, and mobility, with self-care being the 
least important health dimension.
CONCLUSIONS: The study addresses an important research gap and presents the 
EQ-5D-Y value set for Slovenia. At the time of writing, no published value sets 
are available for the EQ-5D-Y-3L appropriate for use in QALY calculations, 
making this value set the first EQ-5D-Y value set in the world.

AIM: To assess edentulism-free life expectancy (EFLE) and the related 
inequalities by sex and schooling among older Brazilian adults from 2006 to 
2016.
BACKGROUND: Tooth loss is related to shortened longevity and unhealthy life 
expectancy in old age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The outcome of the study was EFLE, assessed by age, sex 
and schooling. EFLE was estimated using the Sullivan method, considering the 
years and proportion of remaining life and the prevalence of edentulism-assessed 
in the Health, Well-being, and Aging cohort study, as well as the official 
mortality data for adults aged 60 years or older living in São Paulo, Brazil.
RESULTS: EFLE increased from 10.9 (95% CI: 10.4-11.5) to 13.8 (95% CI: 
13.2-14.5) years, considering data from 2006 to 2016, among 60-year-old 
individuals. In relative terms, these individuals expected to live 50.7% (95% 
CI: 48.1-53.2) of their remaining life free of edentulism in 2006, while this 
expectation was 62.8% (95% CI: 60.0-65.6) in 2016. Within both years, women and 
the less educated had lower EFLE than men and the higher educated.
CONCLUSION: EFLE increased from 2006 to 2016. However, inequalities concerning 
sex and education remained significant, thereby highlighting the need to 
continuously address inequalities in tooth loss throughout life to contribute to 
a healthy ageing.

BACKGROUND: While kidney transplantation is optimal for the treatment of 
end-stage kidney disease, available organs do not meet demand. Little is known 
about the outcomes of patients who are delisted (removed from the waitlist) and 
unable to benefit from transplant. We describe patients who are delisted and 
their life expectancy after delisting.
METHODS: Patients ≥ 18 years listed for deceased donor kidney transplant between 
01/2003 and 12/2013 were identified in the Scientific Registry of Transplant 
Recipients and followed through 12/2018. A competing risk model was used to 
measure the association of demographic and clinical factors with waitlist 
outcomes of delisting, transplant, and death. Multivariate Cox modeling was used 
to evaluate factors associated with death after delisting.
RESULTS: Of 324,582 patients listed, 18.0% were delisted, most common reasons 
were "too sick" or "other." After delisting, half (49.7%) had died by end of 
follow-up; time to death after removal was 5 years. Increasing age and public 
insurance were associated with increased risk of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in five patients will be delisted from the kidney 
transplant waitlist. These patients live a surprisingly long time after removal. 
Much remains unknown about these patients, which could be improved through data 
collection. Delisting is an important patient outcome that warrants further 
exploration.

AIM: This study aimed to examine if there is an interaction between alcohol use 
and human development in terms of their associations with alcohol-attributable 
health harms.
DESIGN: Statistical modelling of global country- and region-specific data from 
2016.
SETTING: Global.
PARTICIPANTS/CASES: The units of the analyses were countries (n = 180) and 
regions (n = 4) based on their Human Development Index (HDI).
MEASUREMENTS: Alcohol-attributable harms [deaths, years of life lost (YLL), 
years lived with disability (YLD) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
lost] and risk relations were based on a recent study using World Health 
Organization (WHO) estimates for 2016. Human development was measured using the 
HDI, a summary score of life expectancy, education and gross national income 
from the United Nations Development Programme. Interactions between HDI and 
adult per-capita consumption (APC) affecting alcohol-attributable harms were 
assessed using likelihood ratio tests. Differences in alcohol-attributable harms 
per litre of APC between HDI groups were assessed using regression analyses and 
a reference group of low HDI.
FINDINGS: APC is associated with alcohol-attributable deaths, YLL, YLDs and 
DALYs lost, while HDI is associated with alcohol-attributable deaths, YLL and 
DALYs lost. Statistical analyses indicated there is an interaction between HDI 
and APC in their associations with alcohol-attributable deaths, YLL and DALYs 
lost per 100 000 people. The alcohol-attributable burden was highest in low HDI 
countries, with 11.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 10.75, 12.40] deaths and 
495.61 (95% CI = 461.83, 569.23) DALYs lost per 100 000 people per litre of APC, 
and lowest in very high HDI countries, with 4.15 (95% CI = 2.46, 5.71) deaths 
and 200.31 (95% CI = 122.78, 265.10) DALYs lost per 100 000 people per litre of 
APC. However, no statistical differences between low and very high HDI groupings 
for these burdens were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an interaction between the Human Development 
Index and alcohol use in their associations with alcohol-attributable deaths, 
years of life lost and disability-adjusted life years lost but not with 
alcohol-attributable years lived with disability. Alcohol appears to have a 
stronger harmful impact per litre of alcohol consumed in lesser developed 
countries than in developed countries.

Marfan syndrome (MFS), a rare genetic disease, has a prevalence of 6.5 in 
100,000. Studies show that patients with MFS have reduced areal bone mineral 
density (BMD) compared with non-MFS individuals. We have previously shown that 
patients with MFS have reduced volumetric BMD and compromised trabecular and 
cortical bone microarchitecture. The present study was a registry-based, 
nationwide, population-based, cohort study using register data, aimed to 
evaluate fracture risk and fracture rates in MFS. We included 406 (196 women) 
patients with MFS through the Danish National Patient Register and 40,724 
(19,327 women) persons, randomly selected and matched from the Civil Registry 
System. A total of 21.9% of the MFS and 18.9% of the reference population had 
experienced at least one fracture from 1995 to 2018. The fracture incidence rate 
was 27.5 per 1000 person-years in the MFS cohort (highest in young men and old 
women with MFS), and 20.3 per 1000 person-years in the reference population. The 
overall incidence rate ratio between the MFS and the reference population was 
1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI ] 1.18-1.55) for all fractures. When 
evaluating the risk of being registered with an osteoporosis diagnosis in the 
Danish National Patient Register, starting relevant treatment for osteoporosis 
or experiencing a hip or spine fracture, 10.3% of the MFS cohort and 3.3% of the 
reference population could be classified as being osteoporotic. The 
between-group subhazard ratio was 3.97 (95% CI 2.56-6.25). Patients with MFS 
started treatment with an antiosteoporotic drug at a younger age than the 
reference population (57 [interquartile range 55-67] versus 71 [63-73]) years. 
The life expectancy in MFS is increasing, resulting in more patients facing 
diseases that are related to old age, such as age-related bone loss and 
increased risk of fractures. Our data suggest that bone health and fracture 
prevention needs to be part of the standard care for patients with MFS. © 2021

Estimation and modeling of the restricted mean time lost in the presence of 
competing risks.

Conner SC(1), Trinquart L(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Biostatistics, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Survival data with competing or semi-competing risks are common in observational 
studies. As an alternative to cause-specific and subdistribution hazard ratios, 
the between-group difference in cause-specific restricted mean times lost (RMTL) 
gives the mean difference in life expectancy lost to a specific cause of death 
or in disease-free time lost, in the case of a nonfatal outcome, over a 
prespecified period. To adjust for covariates, we introduce an inverse 
probability weighted estimator and its variance for the marginal difference in 
RMTL. We also introduce an inverse probability of censoring weighted regression 
model for the RMTL. In simulation studies, we examined the finite sample 
performance of the proposed methods under proportional and nonproportional 
subdistribution hazards scenarios. We illustrated both methods with competing 
risks data from the Framingham Heart Study. We estimated sex differences in 
atrial fibrillation (AF)-free times lost over 40 years. We also estimated sex 
differences in mean lifetime lost to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD 
death over 10 years among individuals with AF.

Life expectancy has increased unprecedentedly in recent decades, benefiting the 
longevity of the world's population. The most frequent pathological conditions 
presented in this age group include excessive body fat, frailty, and 
hypercholesterolemia. These pathological characteristics condition general 
health and autonomy in adults to carry out their usual activities. In this 
sense, the search for a healthy lifestyle is necessary, consisting in a healthy 
diet that includes supplementation with nutraceuticals and the daily practice of 
physical activity. This study protocol aims to evaluate the independent and 
synergistic effect of 12 weeks of Spirulina maxima intake (5 g/day), with or 
without an exercise program on metabolic and fitness parameters of 52 sedentary 
older adults with excessive body mass in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, 
controlled trial design. The main findings from this trial will provide novel 
evidence for future interventions designed for the elderly population and the 
result will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and international 
meetings. ClinicalTrials.gov identification number: NCT04658875 (Effect of 
Spirulina maxima and Exercise on General Fitness and Blood Lipids in Older 
Adults).

This study aims to identify the role of socio-economic and female indicators on 
child mortality in Bangladesh from the data of 1975 - 2019. A number of 
econometric techniques of time series analysis like Augmented Dickey-Fuller, 
Autoregressive Distributive Lag bounds and pair-wise Granger causality tests 
have been applied to ascertain the desired outcomes. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller 
test has confirmed that neither series is integrated at level two and the 
Autoregressive Distributive Lag bounds testing approach has shown the 
cointegration and short-run and long-run relationship between the variables. 
Total fertility rate and urbanization have a positive effect, and female 
education, female life expectancy at birth, and economic growth rate have a 
negative effect on the child mortality rate. The pair-wise Granger causality 
test has shown the unidirectional and bidirectional causal relationship among 
the studied variables. All the outcomes are theoretically consistent and the 
policy recommendations are made based on findings.

Emerging Protein Biomarkers in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Prognosis: An Aid for 
Multivariate Indexing.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a chronic and degenerative disease propelled 
by a mutation in BRCA1/2 genes, familial history, smoking and polycystic ovary 
syndrome. Although the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is low, yet it is the 
fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Surprisingly, EOC represents 90% 
of all ovarian cancers, out of which 70% of women are diagnosed with the 
malignancy at its advanced III-IV stages. Early detection may increase the life 
expectancy up to 5 years. Thus, it has become the need of the hour to attain 
improvement of clinical outcomes of EOC and improve the life expectancy of 
patients. A plethora of proteins in different biological fluids may serve as 
prospective identifiers for the disease. Over the years, accurate identification 
of proteins secreted by EOC cells has been perfected by in vitro and in silico 
state-of-theart technologies. Multivariate test, consisting of 
histo-pathological data in combination with protein biomarker panel has paved 
way for enhanced and accurate assessment of EOC; still, there is a chance of 
further improvement. This review encompasses the advances made in ovarian cancer 
biomarker discovery and demonstrates their potential usefulness for the design 
of early diagnostics of EOC.

Hospital of the Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany; German Institute for 
Vascular Health Research (DIGG) of the German Society for Vascular Surgery and 
Vascular Medicine (DGG), Berlin, Germany.

BACKGROUND: This review presents the surgical indications, surgical procedures, 
and results in the treatment of asymptomatic and ruptured abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAA).
METHODS: An updated search of the literature on screening, diagnosis, treatment, 
and follow-up of AAA, based on the German clinical practice guideline published 
in 2018.
RESULTS: Surgery is indicated in men with an asymptomatic AAA ≥ 5.5 cm and in 
women, ≥ 5.0 cm. The indication in men is based on four randomized trials, while 
in women the data are not conclusive. The majority of patients with AAA (around 
80%) meanwhile receive endovascular treatment (endovascular aortic repair, 
EVAR). Open surgery (open aneurysm repair, OAR) is reserved for patients with 
longer life expectancy and lower morbidity. The pooled 30-day mortality is 1.16% 
(95% confidence interval [0.92; 1.39]) following EVAR, 3.27% [2.7; 3.83] after 
OAR. Women have higher operative/interventional mortality than men (odds ratio 
1.67%). The mortality for ruptured AAA is extremely high: around 80% of women 
and 70% of men die after AAA rupture. Ruptured AAA should, if possible, be 
treated via the endovascular approach, ideally with the patient under local 
anesthesia. Treatment at specialized centers guarantees the required expertise 
and infrastructure. Long-term periodic monitoring by mean of imaging (duplex 
sonography, plus computed tomography if needed) is essential, particularly 
following EVAR, to detect and (if appropriate) treat endoleaks, to document 
stable diameter of the eliminated aneurysmal sac, and to determine whether 
reintervention is necessary (long-term reintervention rate circa 18%).
CONCLUSION: Vascular surgery now offers a high degree of safety in the treatment 
of patients with asymptomatic AAA. Endovascular intervention is preferred.

Dopamine (DA) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were traditionally 
viewed as an extension of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA population. While 
the VTA DA population is known to play important roles in reward processing, 
emerging evidence now supports the view that DRN DA neurons are a specialized 
midbrain DA subsystem that performs distinct functions in parallel to the VTA DA 
population. Recent studies have shed new light on the roles of DRN DA neurons in 
encoding incentive salience and in regulating memory expression and arousal. 
Here, we review recent findings using mouse models about the physiology and 
behavioral functions of DRN DA neurons, highlight the engagement of DRN DA 
neurons and their upstream circuits in opioid addiction, and discuss emerging 
lines of investigation that reveal multifaceted heterogeneity among DRN DA 
neurons.

Dexamethasone can reduce mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients needing 
oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively. Here, we estimate the 
potential number of lives saved and life years gained if this treatment were to 
be rolled out in the UK and globally, as well as the cost-effectiveness of 
implementing this intervention. Assuming SARS-CoV-2 exposure levels of 5% to 
15%, we estimate that, for the UK, approximately 12,000 (4,250 - 27,000) lives 
could be saved between July and December 2020. Assuming that dexamethasone has a 
similar effect size in settings where access to oxygen therapies is limited, 
this would translate into approximately 650,000 (240,000 - 1,400,000) lives 
saved globally over the same time period. If dexamethasone acts differently in 
these settings, the impact could be less than half of this value. To estimate 
the full potential of dexamethasone in the global fight against COVID-19, it is 
essential to perform clinical research in settings with limited access to oxygen 
and/or ventilators, for example in low- and middle-income countries.

Background: Globalization has brought about rapid economic and technological 
development, and life expectancy (LE) is constantly increasing. However, it is 
not clear whether an increase in LE will result in an increase in healthy life 
expectancy (HLE). This study evaluates trends in the self-rated healthy life 
expectancy (SRHLE) of residents aged 15 and older in Jiangxi Province of China 
from 2013 to 2018 and analyzes gender differences and urban-rural differences. 
This study provides a basis for the formulation of relevant public health 
policies. Methods: Based on two National Health Services Survey databases of 
Jiangxi in 2013 and 2018 as well as infant mortality rates and under-5 mortality 
rates from the Health Commission of Jiangxi, the Sullivan method was used to 
calculate SRHLE. The changes in SRHLE were decomposed into health and mortality 
effects using the decomposition method. Results: SRHLE decreased from 56.55 to 
55.54 years and from 60.00 to 57.87 years for men and women aged 15 from 2013 to 
2018, respectively. The SRHLE of women aged 15 was 3.45 and 2.34 years longer 
than that of men in 2013 and 2018, respectively. The SRHLE of urban men aged 15 
was 2.9 and 4.46 years longer than that of rural men in 2013 and 2018, 
respectively, and that of urban women aged 15 was 3.28 and 5.57 years longer 
than that of rural women. Conclusions: The decreased SRHLE indicated that the 
self-rated health (SRH) status of residents in Jiangxi has worsened, and it 
provided evidence for the expansion of morbidity, mainly due to the increased 
prevalence of chronic diseases and the improvement in residents' health 
awareness. Policy efforts are necessary to control the increased morbidity of 
chronic diseases and reduce gender and urban-rural differences in the quantity 
and quality of years lived.

The application of mass spectrometry (MS) to detect unique peptide markers has 
been widely employed as a means of identifying bacterial proteins. Botulinum 
neurotoxins (BoNTs) are bacterial proteins that cause the life-threatening 
disease botulism. BoNTs are divided into several antigenically distinct 
serotypes and several dozen subtypes. The toxins' molecular heterogeneity makes 
their detection highly challenging. In this study, we describe a new 
LC-MS/MS-based platform for the direct identification of proteins derived from 
various species and subspecies in a single assay, as exemplified by BoNTs. The 
platform employs a rational down-selection process through several steps based 
on a combination of bioinformatics, tryptic digestion, and LC-MS, each leads to 
the final panel of markers. This approach has been demonstrated for all 8 
subtypes of botulinum serotype A (BoNT/A). Ab-independent and Ab-dependent 
assays were developed based on the identification of 4 rationally selected 
markers or a combination of some of them, which enables full selectivity 
coverage. The Ab-independent assay, which is highly simple and rapid, has a 
sample-to-result turnaround time of approximately 40 min and enables the 
identification of 500 MsLD50/mL (5 ng/mL) BoNT/A in complex environmental 
matrices. The Ab-dependent assay, which is based on toxin's specific enrichment, 
has a turnaround time of 100 min, but enables improved sensitivity (50 
MsLD50/mL, 0.5 ng/mL). Both assays were verified and validated using various 
environmental samples. This approach can easily be expanded to other botulinum 
serotypes and exhibits the potential for even further extension as a highly 
multiplexed assay for protein-based toxins, viruses, and organisms.

INTRODUCTION: Recently the phase 3 BEACON trial showed that the combination of 
encorafenib, cetuximab, and binimetinib versus cetuximab and irinotecan/FOLFIRI 
improved overall survival in pre-treated patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC) with BRAF V600E mutation. However, whether the benefits of these 
therapies justify their high costs has not been estimated in the USA. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of BEC 
(binimetinib, encorafenib, and cetuximab), EC (encorafenib and cetuximab), and 
CI/CF (cetuximab with irinotecan or FOLFIRI) in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated 
mCRC after first- and second-line therapy.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to determine the costs and effects of 
BEC, EC, and CI/CF on the basis of BEACON trial outcomes data. Health outcomes 
were measured in life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses characterized parameters influencing cost-effectiveness. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted as well.
RESULTS: The QALYs gained in BEC, EC, and CI/CF were 0.62, 0.54, and 0.40, 
respectively. BEC resulted in ICERs of $883,895.73/QALY and $1,646,846.14/QALY 
versus CI/CF and EC, respectively. Compared with CI/CF, the ICER was 
$435,449.88/QALY in EC. The most sensitive parameters in the comparison among 
the three arms were the utilities of progressive disease and progression-free 
survival. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the probability of BEC 
and EC being cost-effective was 0%. In subgroup analyses, the ICER remained 
above the willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: BEC and EC were not cost-effective regimens for patients with 
pre-treated mCRC with BRAF V600E mutation.

It is well established that the underlying theoretical assumptions needed to 
obtain a constant proportional trade-off between a quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) and willingness to pay (WTP) are restrictive and often empirically 
violated. In this paper, we set out to investigate whether the proportionality 
conditions (in terms of scope insensitivity and severity independence) can be 
satisfied when data is restricted to include only respondents who pass certain 
consistency criteria. We hypothesize that the more we restrict the data, the 
better the compliance with the requirement of constant proportional trade-off 
between WTP and QALY. We revisit the Danish data from the European Value of a 
QALY survey eliciting individual WTP for a QALY (WTP-Q). Using a "chained 
approach" respondents were first asked to value a specified health state using 
the standard gamble (SG) or the time-trade-off (TTO) approach and subsequently 
asked their WTP for QALY gains of 0.05 and 0.1 (tailored according to the 
respondent's SG/TTO valuation). Analyzing the impact of the different exclusion 
criteria on the two proportionality conditions, we find strong evidence against 
a constant WTP-Q. Restricting our data to include only respondents who pass the 
most stringent consistency criteria does not impact on the performance of the 
proportionality conditions for WTP-Q.

Homecare workers in Italy: a narrative review.

Rome, Italy.

INTRODUCTION: The progressive ageing and ever-increasing life expectancy of the 
world's population are accompanied by an increase in chronic pathologies. Italy 
continues to be the nation with the highest percentage of senior citizens. 
Recent economic crises and movements of social change have led to a gradual 
increase in the use of homecare workers for the territorial and family 
management of chronic illnesses. Contrary to what has happened in other 
countries, in Italy an informal logic has prevailed regarding the recruitment 
and the employment of homecare workers, hindering the evolution of this sector.
AIMS: This narrative review focuses on the role of homecare workers, as it 
appears in Italian researches.
METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using the following electronic 
databases: CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, and SocINDEX. 
Only studies conducted in the past 20 years with an Italian Homecare Worker 
(HCW) target population were considered. Data were extracted from each 
manuscript to allow for quick comparisons of information, such as research 
objectives, study methodologies, data collection tools, and relative results. 
Two reviewers independently extracted the following data for each study: region, 
setting context, participant characteristics, group description and sample, 
outcomes measured, and a description of the main results.
RESULTS: From the analysis of heterogeneous Italian literature, the importance 
of homecare workers is clear. Their work not only influences assisted 
individuals but also informal caregivers and the direct costs of the Italian 
national health system.
CONCLUSION: Homecare workers are important in Italian society. The little 
attention that the scientific literature has paid to this population may be due 
to the difficulty of finding subjects with a legal status and, therefore, who 
are willing to participate in specific investigations. Investigating the dyad of 
care and extending these investigations to the surrounding family context, seem 
to be the major priorities that should be explored by future research.

The release of newly selected αβT cells from the thymus is key in establishing a 
functional adaptive immune system. Emigration of the first cohorts of αβT cells 
produced during the neonatal period is of particular importance, because it 
initiates formation of the peripheral αβT-cell pool and provides immune 
protection early in life. Despite this, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of 
thymus emigration are poorly understood. We examined the involvement of diverse 
stromal subsets and individual chemokine ligands in this process. First, we 
demonstrated functional dichotomy in the requirement for CCR7 ligands and 
identified CCL21, but not CCL19, as an important regulator of neonatal thymus 
emigration. To explain this ligand-specific requirement, we examined sites of 
CCL21 production and action and found Ccl21 gene expression and CCL21 protein 
distribution occurred within anatomically distinct thymic areas. Although Ccl21 
transcription was limited to subsets of medullary epithelium, CCL21 protein was 
captured by mesenchymal stroma consisting of integrin α7+ pericytes and CD34+ 
adventitial cells at sites of thymic exit. This chemokine compartmentalization 
involved the heparan sulfate-dependent presentation of CCL21 via its C-terminal 
extension, explaining the absence of a requirement for CCL19, which lacks this 
domain and failed to be captured by thymic stroma. Collectively, we identified 
an important role for CCL21 in neonatal thymus emigration, revealing the 
importance of this chemokine in initial formation of the peripheral immune 
system. Moreover, we identified an intrathymic mechanism involving cell-specific 
production and presentation of CCL21, which demonstrated a functional synergy 
between thymic epithelial and mesenchymal cells for αβT-cell emigration.

PURPOSE: Radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment option for brain 
metastases (BMs). Long-term results of the first worldwide experience with a 
mono-isocentric, non-coplanar, linac-based stereotactic technique in the 
treatment of multiple BMs are reported.
METHODS: patients with multiple BMs, life expectancy > 3 months, and good 
performance status (≤ 2) were treated with simultaneous SRS with volumetric 
modulated arc technique. Data were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: 172 patients accounting for 1079 BMs were treated at our institution 
from 2017 to 2020. The median number of treated metastases was 4 (range 2-22). 
Primary tumor histology was: lung (44.8%), breast (32%), and melanoma (9.4%). 
The 2-year LPFS was 71.6%, respectively. A biological effective dose 
(BED) ≥ 51.3 Gy10 correlated with higher local control. Uncontrolled systemic 
disease and melanoma histology were independent prognostic factors correlated 
with decreased iPFS. Patients with > 10 BMs had a trend towards shorter iPFS 
(p = 0.055). 31 patients received multiple SRS courses (2-7) in case of 
intracranial progression. The median iOS was 22.4 months. Brainstem metastases 
and total PTV > 7.1 cc correlated with shorter iOS. The 1- and 2-year WBRT-free 
survival was 83.2% and 61.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Long-term results in a large patient population treated with a 
mono-isocentric, dedicated technique demonstrated its effectiveness and safety 
also in the case of multiple courses. The shortened treatment time and the 
possibility to safely spare healthy brain tissue allows the safe treatment of 
patients with a large number of metastases and to deliver multiple courses of 
SRS. In selected cases, the administration of WBRT can be delayed.

928. Pharmacoeconomic Report: Eculizumab (Soliris): Alexion Pharma Canada 
Corporation: Indication: Adult patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis 
[Internet].

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2020 Dec.
CADTH Common Drug Reviews.

CADTH made the following changes to the sponsor’s economic model to account for 
identified limitations: removed the assumption of Myasthenia Gravis Activities 
of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score deterioration over time on standard of care 
(SOC); reduced the mortality rate from myasthenic crisis; reduced the frequency 
of routine clinician visits; assumed all vaccination and administration costs 
would be covered by the public payer; and assigned correct probabilistic 
distributions to the model inputs. CADTH’s reanalyses resulted in the same 
findings as the sponsor: adding eculizumab to SOC compared to SOC alone is not 
cost-effective at conventionally accepted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) thresholds. Based on CADTH reanalysis, eculizumab plus SOC compared to 
SOC alone is associated with an ICER of $1,505,712 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained and has a 0% probability of being cost-effective for 
patients with refractory AChR-antibody–positive generalized myasthenia gravis 
(gMG) at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY. A price 
reduction of 91% would be required to achieve an ICER below a WTP threshold 
$50,000 per QALY. The submitted price of eculizumab is the key driver of the 
cost-effectiveness estimates. Important limitations remain that CADTH was unable 
to address, including assumptions made about the natural history of gMG and the 
anticipated use of eculizumab. Together, these introduce structural and 
parameter uncertainties that affect the overall precision of the 
cost-effectiveness estimates. The majority of incremental QALYs (> 90%) occurred 
beyond the observation period of the clinical trial and its extension study; as 
extrapolations were made based on several assumptions with high levels of 
uncertainty, the magnitude of this QALY gain is also uncertain. These 
limitations affected CADTH’s ability to conduct a precise health economic 
analysis. Despite the limitations noted above, it is very unlikely that 
eculizumab would be considered cost-effective without considerable price 
reduction.
