iridoplasty. Anterior chamber paracentesis and diode laser transcleral 
cyclophotocoagulation may be considered in special situations. Relative pupil 
block can be relieved by peripheral laser iridotomy and primary lens extraction; 
the latter is a more effective treatment according to the results of clinical 
trials. However, primary lens extraction can be technically demanding in the 
acute setting. Peripheral laser iridotomy has a role in relieving pupil block 
and should also be considered in most cases. Lens extraction may be combined 
with procedures such as goniosynechialysis, trabeculectomy or endoscopic 
cyclophotocoagulation. In this review, we aim to discuss the available evidence 
regarding the different treatment modalities. We also discuss the economic 
consideration, including cost-effectiveness and life expectancy, in the 
management of acute primary angle closure.

原发性急性闭角型青光眼大发作时需要紧急处理,包括快速降眼压和解除相对瞳孔阻滞,相对瞳孔阻滞是闭角型青光眼大发作最常见的发病机制。降低眼压的紧急治疗策略包括药物治疗和氩激光周边虹膜成形术。在特殊情况下,可以考虑前房穿刺术和半导体激光经巩膜睫状光凝术。通过周边激光虹膜切除术和晶体摘除术可以减轻相对瞳孔阻塞; 
根据临床试验结果,晶体摘除术是更有效的治疗方法。然而,在急性情况下,晶体摘除在技术上要求很高。周边激光虹膜切除术具有减轻瞳孔阻滞作用,而且在大多数情况下也应当被考虑。晶体摘除术可以与手术相结合,如巩膜粘连松解、小梁切除术或内窥镜下睫状光凝术。在这此篇综述中,我们旨在讨论不同治疗方式的现有临床证据。我们进一步讨论了原发急性闭角型青光眼患者的经济因素,包括成本效益和预期寿命。.

The strawberry mite, Phytonemus pallidus fragariae (Banks) (Acari: 
Tarsonemidae), is one of the most important pests of greenhouse grown strawberry 
plants. Field grown strawberries may also be infested by the pest in high humid 
conditions. Life tables give the most comprehensive description of the 
development, survival, stage differentiation, reproduction and consequently 
population growth of a population, and thus it is an important base of 
population ecology and pest management. In this study, to provide a 
comprehensive evaluation of an ecology-based and cost-effective control program, 
life history and demographic parameters of the strawberry mite were studied. The 
experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions providing 20 ± 1 °C, 
80 ± 10% RH and L16:D8 photoperiod. The data were analyzed based on the 
age-stage, two-sex life table theory. The population parameters net reproduction 
rate (R0 = 6.14 offspring), intrinsic rate of increase (r = 0.1317 day-1), and 
finite rate of increase (λ = 1.1407 day-1) on cv. Aromas were lower than those 
on the other cultivars tested. Based on the population characteristics, Aromas 
is a less favorable cultivar for the population growth of strawberry mite.

BACKGROUND: Depression is usually managed in primary care and antidepressants 
are often the first-line treatment, but only half of those treated respond to a 
single antidepressant.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether or not combining mirtazapine with 
serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) or selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants results in better patient outcomes and 
more efficient NHS care than SNRI or SSRI therapy alone in treatment-resistant 
depression (TRD).
DESIGN: The MIR trial was a two-parallel-group, multicentre, pragmatic, 
placebo-controlled randomised trial with allocation at the level of the 
individual.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from primary care in Bristol, Exeter, 
Hull/York and Manchester/Keele.
PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants were aged ≥ 18 years; were taking a SSRI or 
a SNRI antidepressant for at least 6 weeks at an adequate dose; scored ≥ 14 
points on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); were adherent to 
medication; and met the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, criteria for depression.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised using a computer-generated code to 
either oral mirtazapine or a matched placebo, starting at a dose of 15 mg daily 
for 2 weeks and increasing to 30 mg daily for up to 12 months, in addition to 
their usual antidepressant. Participants, their general practitioners (GPs) and 
the research team were blind to the allocation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was depression symptoms at 12 weeks 
post randomisation compared with baseline, measured as a continuous variable 
using the BDI-II. Secondary outcomes (at 12, 24 and 52 weeks) included response, 
remission of depression, change in anxiety symptoms, adverse events (AEs), 
quality of life, adherence to medication, health and social care use and 
cost-effectiveness. Outcomes were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. A 
qualitative study explored patients' views and experiences of managing 
depression and GPs' views on prescribing a second antidepressant.
RESULTS: There were 480 patients randomised to the trial (mirtazapine and usual 
care, n = 241; placebo and usual care, n = 239), of whom 431 patients (89.8%) 
were followed up at 12 weeks. BDI-II scores at 12 weeks were lower in the 
mirtazapine group than the placebo group after adjustment for baseline BDI-II 
score and minimisation and stratification variables [difference -1.83 points, 
95% confidence interval (CI) -3.92 to 0.27 points; p = 0.087]. This was smaller 
than the minimum clinically important difference and the CI included the null. 
The difference became smaller at subsequent time points (24 weeks: -0.85 points, 
95% CI -3.12 to 1.43 points; 12 months: 0.17 points, 95% CI -2.13 to 2.46 
points). More participants in the mirtazapine group withdrew from the trial 
medication, citing mild AEs (46 vs. 9 participants).
CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find convincing evidence of a clinically 
important benefit for mirtazapine in addition to a SSRI or a SNRI antidepressant 
over placebo in primary care patients with TRD. There was no evidence that the 
addition of mirtazapine was a cost-effective use of NHS resources. GPs and 
patients were concerned about adding an additional antidepressant.
LIMITATIONS: Voluntary unblinding for participants after the primary outcome at 
12 weeks made interpretation of longer-term outcomes more difficult.
FUTURE WORK: Treatment-resistant depression remains an area of important, unmet 
need, with limited evidence of effective treatments. Promising interventions 
include augmentation with atypical antipsychotics and treatment using 
transcranial magnetic stimulation.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy and increasing demands on quality of 
life more spinal meningiomas will limit quality of life in elderly in the coming 
decades. We investigated whether elderly can improve neurologically and gain 
self-dependence postoperatively.
METHODS: Medical records of consecutive spinal meningioma patients from 
2004-2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Age, gender, preoperative duration and 
quality of symptoms, pre- and postoperative McCormick score, Karnofsky 
Performance Status (KPS), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 
(ASA), modified Clinical Scoring System (mCSS) and tumor characteristics were 
included. Elderly were defined by ≥70 years.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients were included, of whom 44 were 70 
years or older. Younger patients were significantly better preoperatively in 
McCormick, KPS, ASA and mCSS within the first postoperative year. Both younger 
and elderly patients improved significantly postoperatively in McCormick, KPS 
and mCSS. Surgical complication rate was similar for younger and elderly 
patients (5.9 vs. 6.8%). Systemic complication rate was higher in elderly (0 vs. 
6.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for spinal meningioma in elderly (KPS≥40 and ASA≤III) leads 
to a significant improvement of McCormick, KPS and mCSS postoperatively. This 
leads to a higher rate of self-dependency and thereby probably to an improvement 
of quality of life in elderly. However, special attention for systemic 
complications is necessary.

Ambient air pollution in terms of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and 
PM10) has been shown to increase adult and infant mortalities. Most studies have 
estimated the risk of mortalities through attributable proportions and number of 
excess cases with no reference to the time lost due to premature mortalities. 
Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) are necessary to measure the health 
impact of Ambient particulate matter (PM) over time. In this study, we used 
life-tables for three years (2014⁻2016) to estimate the years of life lost 
(YLL), a main component of DALYs, for adult mortalities (age 30+ years) and 
postneonatal infant mortalities (age 28+ days⁻1 year) associated with PM2.5 
exposure and PM10 exposure, respectively. The annual average of PM2.5 and PM10 
concentrations were recorded as 87.9 μg/m³ and 167.5 μg/m³, which are 8 times 
greater than the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines of 10 
μg/m³ and 20 μg/m³, respectively. Results indicated a total of 252.18 (95% CI: 
170.69⁻322.92) YLL for all ages with an increase of 27,474.61 (95% CI: 
18,483.02⁻35,370.58) YLL over 10 years. The expected life remaining (ELR) 
calculations showed that 30- and 65-year-old persons would gain 2.34 years and 
1.93 years, respectively if the current PM2.5 exposure levels were reduced to 
the WHO interim targets (IT-1 = 35 μg/m³). Newborns and 1-year old children may 
live 79.81 and 78.94 years, respectively with an increase in average life 
expectancy of 2.65 years if the WHO PM10 interim targets were met (IT-1 = 70 
μg/m³). Sensitivity analyses for YLL were carried out for the years 2015, 2025, 
and 2045 and showed that the years of life would increase significantly for age 
groups between 30 and 85. Life expectancy, especially for the elderly (≥60 
years), would increase at higher rates if PM2.5 levels were reduced further. 
This study can be helpful for the assessment of poor air quality represented by 
PM2.5 and PM10 exposures in causing premature adult mortalities and postneonatal 
infant mortalities in developing countries with high ambient air pollution. 
Information in this article adds insights to the sustainable development goals 
(SDG 3.9.1 and 11.6.2) related to the reduction of mortality rates attributed to 
ambient air levels of coarse and fine particulate matter.

BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are a common problem in the ageing population. Hip 
arthroplasty is the common treatment option for displaced intracapsular neck of 
femur fractures. Even though hip replacements are successful in restoring 
mobility, reducing pain and diminishing loss of health-related quality of life, 
the potential impact of a hip fracture on life expectancy as well as the 
postoperative mortality need consideration. The purpose of this study was to 
describe the mid-term relative survival rate for a cohort of Swedish patients 
whom underwent total- or hemiarthroplasty surgery following hip fracture. We 
also explored whether the survival rate is prosthesis-type specific and 
influenced by comorbidities, sex, socioeconomic and surgical factors.
METHODS: Using prospectively collected information of the Swedish Hip 
Arthroplasty Register-linked database we identified 43,891 patients operated 
between 2005 and 2012. Patient- and surgery-specific data in combination with 
socio-economic data were available for this analysis. We studied relative 
survival rate and used multivariable modelling with Cox Proportional Hazards 
Model in Transformed Time.
RESULTS: Compared to the Swedish general population the baseline excess hazard 
was very high in the first half year after the operation, thereafter the excess 
hazard decreased but remained non-negligible through the 8 years' follow-up 
period. The mortality rate of males was higher compared to women. Higher 
Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI) was associated with worsening survival. 
However, patients who had ECI = 0 had higher mortality than patients with ECI =1 
the first 420 days post fracture. Patients with a hemiarthroplasty had a worse 
survival than patients with a total hip arthroplasty. Of the hospital types 
considered university hospitals had lower survival rate. Younger patients had a 
greater loss of expected life span than patients who suffer hip fracture in 
their more advanced ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Swedish hip fracture patients who undergo arthroplasty surgery had 
a high excess hazard of dying in the first half year following surgery, and this 
excess hazard never subsided to negligible levels at least up to 8 years after 
surgery. Interestingly having no prior record of illnesses worsened the initial 
mortality. Men living alone had the highest long-term excess mortality.

The use of intraoperative cognitive mapping and monitoring during awake surgery 
is not new, but this surgical approach has undergone important changes in recent 
years, especially in the context of low-grade glioma surgery. This rapid 
development is related to the growing awareness from neurosurgeons that 
sustaining quality of life in patients with a long-survival expectancy implies 
assessment and preservation of a range of important functions during surgery, 
beyond "overt" functions, such as language or motricity. Here we describe the 
different behavioral paradigms typically used, and how they are selected and 
modulated to identify and spare critical brain-wide cognitive systems.

BACKGROUND: The amount of insulin needed to effectively treat type 2 diabetes 
worldwide is unknown. It also remains unclear how alternative treatment 
algorithms would affect insulin use and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
averted by insulin use, given that current access to insulin (availability and 
affordability) in many areas is low. The aim of this study was to compare 
alternative projections for and consequences of insulin use worldwide under 
varying treatment algorithms and degrees of insulin access.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation of type 2 diabetes burden from 2018 to 
2030 across 221 countries using data from the International Diabetes Federation 
for prevalence projections and from 14 cohort studies representing more than 60% 
of the global type 2 diabetes population for HbA1c, treatment, and bodyweight 
data. We estimated the number of people with type 2 diabetes expected to use 
insulin, international units (IU) required, and DALYs averted per year under 
alternative treatment algorithms targeting HbA1c from 6·5% to 8%, lower 
microvascular risk, or higher HbA1c for those aged 75 years and older.
FINDINGS: The number of people with type 2 diabetes worldwide was estimated to 
increase from 405·6 million (95% CI 315·3 million-533·7 million) in 2018 to 
510·8 million (395·9 million-674·3 million) in 2030. On this basis, insulin use 
is estimated to increase from 516·1 million 1000 IU vials (95% CI 409·0 
million-658·6 million) per year in 2018 to 633·7 million (500·5 million-806·7 
million) per year in 2030. Without improved insulin access, 7·4% (95% CI 
5·8-9·4) of people with type 2 diabetes in 2030 would use insulin, increasing to 
15·5% (12·0-20·3) if insulin were widely accessible and prescribed to achieve an 
HbA1c of 7% (53 mmol/mol) or lower. If HbA1c of 7% or lower was universally 
achieved, insulin would avert 331 101 DALYs per year by 2030 (95% CI 256 601-437 
053). DALYs averted would increase by 14·9% with access to newer oral 
antihyperglycaemic drugs. DALYs averted would increase by 44·2% if an HbA1c of 
8% (64 mmol/mol) were used as a target among people aged 75 years and older 
because of reduced hypoglycaemia.
INTERPRETATION: The insulin required to treat type 2 diabetes is expected to 
increase by more than 20% from 2018 to 2030. More DALYs might be averted if 
HbA1c targets are higher for older adults.

PURPOSE: Monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended for 
long-term use after discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management after percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI). The present study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
clopidogrel versus aspirin after 12-month DAPT for patients with ACS who 
underwent PCI in China.
METHODS: A 2-part model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
clopidogrel compared with aspirin. The short-term part was a decision tree that 
included health states such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, MI and 
stroke, cardiovascular death, and death from other causes with a treatment 
horizon of 1 year (base case), 2 years or 3 years after 12-month DAPT. Major 
bleeding was included. The long-term (lifetime) part was a Markov model that 
included different health states such as MI, after MI, stroke, after stroke, and 
death. Drug acquisition cost and other direct medical costs were based on 
pricing records, literature, and expert panels. Clinical outcomes and utilities 
were based on literature. The model output included incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs 
per patient. Both 1-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA) were conducted.
FINDINGS: In the base-case scenario, the total costs of the treatment with 
clopidogrel and aspirin were ¥12,590 ($1849/€1590) and ¥10,642 ($1563/€1344), 
respectively; the total QALYs of the 2 patient populations were 9.7341 and 
9.6894, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥43,593 
($6402/€5515) per QALY gained was lower than 3 times of gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita in China (¥161,940, $23,786/€20,449). Both 1-way sensitivity 
analysis and PSA confirmed the robustness of the results. PSA results indicated 
that clopidogrel was cost effective versus aspirin in 80.5% of the simulations, 
considering >3 times the GDP per capita as the threshold. Results in other 
scenarios (clopidogrel or aspirin for 2 or 3 years after 12-month DAPT) also 
indicated that clopidogrel was more cost effective than aspirin for patients 
with ACS after 12-month DAPT.
IMPLICATIONS: Compared with aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel monotherapy for 1 
year after 12-month DAPT was cost effective for patients with ACS who underwent 
PCI in China. Furthermore, when the duration of clopidogrel the monotherapy 
extended up to 3 years, clopidogrel was still cost effective compared with 
aspirin. The study was limited by lack of high-quality efficacy data among the 
Chinese population.

Diet restriction is one of the most accurately confirmed interventions which 
extend lifespan. Genes coding circadian core clock elements are known to be the 
key controllers of cell metabolism especially in aging aspect. The molecular 
mechanisms standing behind the phenomenon of diet-restriction-mediated life 
extension are connected to circadian clock either. Here we investigate the 
effects of protein-rich and low-protein diets on lifespan observed in fruit 
flies overexpressing core clock genes (cry, per, Clk, cyc and tim). The majority 
of core clock genes being upregulated in peripheral tissues (muscles and fat 
body) on protein-rich diet significantly decrease the lifespan of male fruit 
flies from 5 to 61%. Nevertheless, positive increments of median lifespan were 
observed in both sexes, males overexpressing cry in fat body lived 20% longer on 
poor diet. Overexpression of per also on poor medium resulted in life extension 
in female fruit flies. Diet restriction reduces mortality caused by 
overexpression of core clock genes. Cox-regression model revealed that diet 
restriction seriously decreases mortality risks of flies which overexpress core 
clock genes. The hazard ratios are lower for flies overexpressing clock genes in 
fat body relatively to muscle-specific overexpression. The present work suggests 
a phenomenological view of how two peripheral circadian oscillators modify 
effects of rich and poor diets on lifespan and hazard ratios.

Although current guidelines recommend mitral valve repair (MVr) over mitral 
valve replacement (MVR) for patients with mitral regurgitation (MR), it is 
unclear if it should be also recommended in elderly patients with limited life 
expectancy. This study was conducted to compare the results of MVr with those of 
MVR to determine the optimal treatment option for patients with degenerative MR, 
particularly according to the patient's age. A literature search of 5 electronic 
databases was performed. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The 
secondary outcomes included early mortality and freedom from reoperation. A 
metaregression analysis and subgroup analysis were performed according to the 
mean age of the study population. Twelve retrospective studies (2,950 and 1,252 
patients in the MVr and MVR groups, respectively) were selected. Pooled analyses 
demonstrated that the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in 
the MVR group than in the MVr group both in all studies and in studies 
presenting adjusted results (hazard ratio[95% confidence interval] = 1.57[1.39 
to 1.77] and 1.53[1.34 to 1.74], respectively). This benefit was similar across 
all ages when the metaregression analysis and the subgroup analysis were 
performed (p = 0.879 and 0.123, respectively). Early mortality and risk of 
reoperation were also higher in the MVR group than in the MVr group (risk 
ratio[95% confidence interval] = 4.51[3.12 to 6.51] and hazard ratio[95% 
confidence interval] = 1.47[1.09 to 1.98], respectively). In conclusion, this 
study indicates that MVr is beneficial compared with MVR in patients with 
degenerative MR regardless of patients' age in terms of all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: Tens of thousands of people die from dog-mediated rabies annually. 
Deaths can be prevented through post-exposure prophylaxis for people who have 
been bitten, and the disease eliminated through dog vaccination. Current 
post-exposure prophylaxis use saves many lives, but availability remains poor in 
many rabies-endemic countries due to high costs, poor access, and supply.
METHODS: We developed epidemiological and economic models to investigate the 
effect of an investment in post-exposure prophylaxis by Gavi, the Vaccine 
Alliance. We modelled post-exposure prophylaxis use according to the status quo, 
with improved access using WHO-recommended intradermal vaccination, with and 
without rabies immunoglobulin, and with and without dog vaccination. We took the 
health provider perspective, including only direct costs.
FINDINGS: We predict more than 1 million deaths will occur in the 67 
rabies-endemic countries considered from 2020 to 2035, under the status quo. 
Current post-exposure prophylaxis use prevents approximately 56 000 deaths 
annually. Expanded access to, and free provision of, post-exposure prophylaxis 
would prevent an additional 489 000 deaths between 2020 and 2035. Under this 
switch to efficient intradermal post-exposure prophylaxis regimens, total 
projected vaccine needs remain similar (about 73 million vials) yet 17·4 million 
more people are vaccinated, making this an extremely cost-effective method, with 
costs of US$635 per death averted and $33 per disability-adjusted life-years 
averted. Scaling up dog vaccination programmes could eliminate dog-mediated 
rabies over this time period; improved post-exposure prophylaxis access remains 
cost-effective under this scenario, especially in combination with patient risk 
assessments to reduce unnecessary post-exposure prophylaxis use.
INTERPRETATION: Investing in post-exposure vaccines would be an extremely 
cost-effective intervention that could substantially reduce disease burden and 
catalyse dog vaccination efforts to eliminate dog-mediated rabies.

In this study, levels of inflammatory protein biomarkers in venous plasma, 
plasma derived from capillary blood from the earlobe, and capillary plasma 
stored as dried plasma spots (DPS) were compared. Samples from 12 male 
individuals were assessed with a panel of 92 inflammation-related proteins using 
multiplex proximity extension assay. Correlations between sample types varied 
greatly between analytes. A high correlation of ρ > 0.8 was observed between 
capillary plasma and DPS for 32 analytes. At this level of correlation, 13 
analytes correlated between venous and capillary plasma and 5 analytes in the 
comparison of venous blood with DPS.

An increase in the life expectancy during the last decades in most world 
countries has resulted in the growing number of people suffering from 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
frontotemporal dementia, and others. Familial forms of neurodegenerative 
diseases account for 5-10% of all cases and are caused by mutations in specific 
genes often resulting in pathological protein deposition. The risk factors for 
neurodegeneration include trauma, lifestyle, and allelic variants of 
disease-associated genes with incomplete penetrance. Many of these gene variants 
are located in immunity-related loci, particularly in the human leukocyte 
antigen locus (HLA class II) coding for proteins of the major histocompatibility 
complex class II (MHCII). HLA class II plays a key role in the antigen 
presentation and is expressed in microglial cells. Microglia is a component of 
innate immunity. On the one hand, microglial cells phagocytize pathological 
protein deposits; on the other hand, they produce proinflammatory factors 
accelerating neuronal death. The involvement of adaptive immunity mechanisms 
(antigen presentation, T cell response, antibody production) in the development 
of neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear and requires further research, 
including more detailed studies of the role of identified HLA class II genetic 
variants.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy inequalities in England have increased steadily 
since the 1980s. Our aim was to investigate how much deaths from different 
diseases and injuries and at different ages have contributed to this rise to 
inform policies that aim to reduce health inequalities.
METHODS: We used vital registration data from the Office for National Statistics 
on population and deaths in England, by underlying cause of death, from 2001 to 
2016, stratified by sex, 5-year age group, and decile of the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (based on the ranked scores of Lower Super Output Areas in England 
in 2015). We grouped the 7·65 million deaths by their assigned International 
Classification of Diseases (10th revision) codes to create categories of public 
health and clinical relevance. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain 
robust estimates of cause-specific death rates by sex, age group, year, and 
deprivation decile. We calculated life expectancy at birth by decile of 
deprivation and year using life-table methods. We calculated the contributions 
of deaths from each disease and injury, in each 5-year age group, to the life 
expectancy gap between the most deprived and affluent deciles using Arriaga's 
method.
FINDINGS: The life expectancy gap between the most affluent and most deprived 
deciles increased from 6·1 years (95% credible interval 5·9-6·2) in 2001 to 7·9 
years (7·7-8·1) in 2016 in females and from 9·0 years (8·8-9·2) to 9·7 years 
(9·6-9·9) in males. Since 2011, the rise in female life expectancy has stalled 
in the third, fourth, and fifth most deprived deciles and has reversed in the 
two most deprived deciles, declining by 0·24 years (0·10-0·37) in the most 
deprived and 0·16 years (0·02-0·29) in the second-most deprived by 2016. Death 
rates from every disease and at every age were higher in deprived areas than in 
affluent ones in 2016. The largest contributors to life expectancy inequalities 
were deaths in children younger than 5 years (mostly neonatal deaths), 
respiratory diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and lung and digestive cancers in 
working ages, and dementias in older ages. From 2001 to 2016, the contributions 
to inequalities declined for deaths in children younger than 5 years, ischaemic 
heart disease (for both sexes), and stroke and intentional injuries (for men), 
but increased for most other causes.
INTERPRETATION: Recent trends in life expectancy in England have not only 
resulted in widened inequalities but the most deprived communities are now 
seeing no life expectancy gain. These inequalities are driven by a diverse group 
of diseases that can be effectively prevented and treated. Adoption of the 
principle of proportionate universalism to prevention and health and social care 
can postpone deaths into older ages for all communities and reduce life 
expectancy inequalities.

BACKGROUND: In the present study, we examined the trends of premature mortality 
due to kidney and bladder cancers among the Japanese population from 1980 
through 2010.
METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the World Health Organization 
mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was estimated using Japanese life 
tables. Average lifespan shortened (ALSS) was calculated and defined as the 
ratio of years of life lost relative to the expected lifespan.
RESULTS: Over the study period, the age-standardized rates to the World Standard 
Population for deaths from kidney and bladder cancers were stable. The average 
years of life lost (AYLL) measure shows decreases of about 4 and 6 years of life 
for kidney cancer in men and women, respectively, and decreases of about 2 years 
of life for bladder cancer in both sexes. The ALSS shows that patients with 
kidney cancer lost 21.0% and 24.7% of their lifespan among men and women in 
1980, whereas respective losses were 15.3% and 15.8% in 2010. Also, patients 
with bladder cancer on average lost 13.5% in men and 14.2% in women in 1980 and 
10.8% in men and 11.1% in women in 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows favorable trends in premature mortality for kidney 
and bladder cancers in Japan over a 30-year period; however, patients with 
bladder cancer on average lost a smaller proportion of their lifespan compared 
to those with kidney cancer. The development of a novel ALSS measure is 
convenient in examination of the burden of premature mortality over time.

Protein therapeutics are increasingly used to treat various diseases, yet they 
often suffer from short serum half-lives. An emerging strategy to extend 
lifetime in vivo is to attach fatty acids onto proteins to increase their 
binding to human serum albumin (HSA). Herein, the genetic encoding of 
ϵ-N-heptanoyl-l-lysine (HepoK) is reported, which introduces a 
fatty-acid-containing amino acid into proteins with exquisite site-specificity 
and homogeneity, overcoming issues associated with existing chemical conjugation 
methods. The expression in E .coli and purification of HepoK-incorporated 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) is demonstrated. GLP1(HepoK) showed stronger 
binding to HSA than GLP1(WT), without impairing the stimulation of the GLP1 
receptor in cells. Moreover, GLP1(HepoK) decreased blood glucose level to the 
same level as GLP1(WT) in mice, showing longer-lasting effects than GLP1(WT). 
HepoK incorporation will also be useful for investigating the function of 
protein lipidation.

OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to compare changes over 2 years in patients' 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) with the health and social care costs of 
diagnosis and treatment of people newly referred to memory assessment services 
(MAS).
METHODS: We analysed observational data from 1318 patients referred to 69 MAS 
who completed resource use and HRQL questionnaires at baseline 3, 6, 12, and 
24 months. We reported mean differences in HRQL (disease-specific DEMQOL and 
generic EQ-5D-3 L), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and 
cost-effectiveness between baseline, and 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Two years after referral to MAS, patients reported a higher DEMQOL 
score (mean gain 4.47, 95% confidence interval, 3.08-5.90) and EQ-5D-3 L (0.014, 
-0.011 to 0.039). Mean total costs and QALYs over 24 months was £2411 
(£1721-£2873) and 0.027 (0.003-0.051), respectively. Assuming that patients' 
HRQL would not have altered over the 2 years had they not attended MAS, these 
outcomes suggest an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £89 546 
(£38 123-£145 864) based on changes in EQ-5D-3 L. If we assumed that patients' 
HRQL would have declined by about 10% over this period had they not attended 
MAS, the cost-effectiveness ratio would be £25 056. The largest MAS (N = 32; 
46%) with over 50 new patients a month were more likely to be cost-effective 
than smaller ones (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: MAS are effective and can be cost-effective for diagnosing and 
treating people with suspected dementia. Large variations in costs between
