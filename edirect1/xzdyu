OBJECTIVES: There are many suggestions offered within the literature to decide 
if a job type is a profession, some using tick box type trait and 
characteristics analyses to compare the actions and qualities of individuals to 
a predefined list. However, there is no specific way to resolve what makes or 
defines a profession. Writers in many disciplines, including radiography, have 
used these different models, sometimes with conflicting results. This paper 
explores the use of Bourdieu's replacement of the concept of profession with 
that of a 'field', meaning a network of occupants with common attributes, in 
this case radiographers, in an attempt to resolve this issue.
FINDINGS: In the UK, radiography practitioners and professional bodies generally 
use the term profession to describe radiography, and this paper explores a 
defence of the term for radiography. Using Bourdieu's field theory not only 
helps define a profession, but also explains the difficulties at the boundaries 
of professions, and the work needed to protect a profession as a credible 
entity.
CONCLUSION: This paper supports the argument that radiography is a profession 
when using Bourdieu's field theory. Radiography continues to work to maintain 
its status by increasing its symbolic capital by increasing the research output 
and evidence base of the profession and through role extension.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Radiographers can perhaps be assured that radiography 
is a profession when using Bourdieu's field theory. This paper shows how 
theoretical frameworks and concepts from outside radiography can be used to 
support new ways of thinking within the profession.

AIMS: Systematically synthesize research about factors that influence CPD over a 
nursing career.
BACKGROUND: Continuing professional development (CPD) in nursing is defined as 
'a life-long process of active participation in learning activities that assist 
in developing and maintaining continuing competences, enhancing professional 
practice and supporting achievement of career goals'. Research has shown that 
inability to access resources and activities for CPD influences quality of care 
and adversely affects nurses' satisfaction, recruitment and retention. Although 
more and more research regarding CPD is done, a comprehensive overview about the 
needs of nurses for successful CPD is missing.
DESIGN: Scoping review, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews ensuring all quality 
standards are met.
METHODS: Between February and April 2020 the electronic databases CINAHL, 
PubMed, Scopus, Psychinfo and Eric were searched as well as reference lists of 
included papers. Papers published in peer-reviewed journals were included 
without restrictions on publication date, design or setting. Thematic analysis 
was done to synthesize the data.
RESULTS: The search yielded 2673 papers of which 60 papers were included. 
Analyses showed that factors that influence CPD differ over a nursing career, 
which led to the identification of three groups: newly graduated nurses; 
experienced nurses; and experienced nurses with ambitions for advanced roles. 
Furthermore, analyses showed that factors for all three groups are related to 
personal and contextual facilitators and barriers. Newly graduated nurses find 
it important to be an accepted member of the team. They experience barriers when 
integrating into the nursing profession, where they for instance experience 
workplace incivility. Experienced nurses experience contextual barriers related 
to a lack of supportive structures and inaccessibility of CPD resources. There 
is limited time and availability of role models and a lack of support from 
managers and other colleagues. Moreover, the clinical care dynamics influence 
their ability to pursue CPD. For the experienced nurses with ambitions for 
advanced roles, an important barrier is that nursing culture emphasizes direct 
patient care. Often it is unclear what the value is of new nursing roles which 
makes it difficult for them to develop these.
CONCLUSIONS: All nurses strive for CPD. However, organizations need to recognize 
nurses' personal goals and unique strategies as this leads to different needs in 
CPD. In addition, resources must be made available and accessible before CPD can 
be successfully pursued by all nurses.

Increased lethality and availability of addictive substances has strained US 
addiction treatment services, further exacerbating workforce shortages in these 
settings. The emotional and physical health toll of providing treatment may 
contribute to shortages. This community-initiated qualitative study aimed to 
identify conditions that affect provider health and turnover in residential 
addiction treatment from a Total Worker Health® perspective. Providers (direct 
service, supervisors, leaders) working in nonprofit residential treatment 
facilities in Massachusetts were recruited by role and geography to participate 
in interviews and focus groups. NVivo12 facilitated coding and analysis. 25% of 
transcripts were double coded to assess interrater reliability and coding 
consistency (mean Kappa = 0.82). Providers (N = 49) participated in 33 
interviews and 4 focus groups. Many participants reported personal addiction 
histories. Analysis revealed how socio-contextual factors originating outside of 
residential facilities were dominant influences on "downstream" working 
conditions, worker health, staff turnover, and by extension, client care. Four 
primary socio-contextual themes surfaced:1) Changes in type and potency of 
substances and client need not reliably accompanied by shifts in treatment 
practices; 2) challenges balancing state requirements and state-provided 
resources; 3) influence of structural discrimination and addiction stigma on pay 
and professional advancement; and 4) geographic location of facilities shape 
work and quality of life. Results were used to develop a conceptual model for 
residential addiction treatment to illustrate pathways by which ecological 
factors interact to affect provider health and turnover. Findings indicate that 
protecting health and wellbeing of providers-many of whom are in addiction 
recovery themselves- is integral to improving addiction treatment. From this 
workforce's perspective, recent changes in socio-contextual factors have 
intensified already challenging working conditions (job demands, pay, 
advancement), negatively impacting worker health, turnover, and client care. Any 
interventions to improve treatment outcomes or working conditions in nonprofit 
addiction facilities must consider larger socio-contextual factors influencing 
these organizations.

BACKGROUND: Patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) 
do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Preclinical models suggested 
synergistic anti-tumour activity combining CXD101 and anti-programmed cell death 
protein 1 treatment; therefore, we assessed the clinical combination of CXD101 
and nivolumab in heavily pre-treated patients with MSS metastatic CRC (mCRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-arm, open-label study enrolled patients aged 
18 years or older with biopsy-confirmed MSS CRC; at least two lines of systemic 
anticancer therapies (including oxaliplatin and irinotecan); at least one 
measurable lesion; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1 
or 2; predicted life expectancy above 3 months; and adequate organ and bone 
marrow function. Nine patients were enrolled in a safety run-in study to define 
a tolerable combination schedule of CXD101 and nivolumab, followed by 46 
patients in the efficacy assessment phase. Patients in the efficacy assessment 
cohort were treated orally with 20 mg CXD101 twice daily for 5 consecutive days 
every 3 weeks, and intravenously with 240 mg nivolumab every 2 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was immune disease control rate (iDCR).
RESULTS: Between 2018 and 2020, 55 patients were treated with CXD101 and 
nivolumab. The combination therapy was well tolerated with the most frequent 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events being neutropenia (18%) and anaemia (7%). 
Immune-related adverse reactions commonly ascribed to checkpoint inhibitors were 
surprisingly rare although we did see single cases of pneumonitis, 
hypothyroidism and hypopituitarism. There were no treatment-related deaths. Of 
46 patients assessable for efficacy, 4 (9%) achieved partial response and 18 
(39%) achieved stable disease, translating to an immune disease control rate of 
48%. The median overall survival (OS) was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval 
5.13-10.22 months).
CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint was met in this phase II study, which showed 
that the combination of CXD101 and nivolumab, at full individual doses in the 
treatment of advanced or metastatic MSS CRC, was both well tolerated and 
efficacious.

Infant with Loeys-Dietz syndrome treated for febrile status epilepticus with 
COVID-19 infection: first reported case of febrile status epilepticus and focal 
seizures in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and review of literature.

Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare, autosomal dominant multisystem disorder 
that is caused by mutations of transforming growth factor-β receptors. Mutations 
in SMAD3 and TGFB3 have been recently reported.LDS is characterised by the triad 
of arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism and a bifid uvula or cleft palate among 
other cardiovascular, craniofacial and orthopaedic manifestations. Patients with 
LDS show clinical and genetic variability and there is a significant risk of 
reduced life expectancy due to widespread arterial involvement, aortic root 
dilation, aneurysms and an aggressive vascular course. Thus early genetic 
testing is warranted if clinical signs and history are suggestive of this 
potentially catastrophic disorder.LDS predisposes patients to aortic aneurysms 
and early death due to vascular malformations, but neurological emergencies, 
such as seizures and febrile status epilepticus, have not been reported.Febrile 
status epilepticus is the most common neurological emergency in childhood. 
Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in the paediatric population are not as 
well described in medical literature.To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first reported case of febrile status epilepticus with COVID-19 infection in an 
infant with LDS. Our patient had focal epileptiform activity emanating over the 
left posterior hemisphere, which evolved into an electrographic seizure on video 
EEG. Such patients have a heightened risk of epilepsy in the future, and this 
occurrence is consistent with a diagnosis of focal epilepsy. Neurological 
complications such as epilepsy and status epilepticus in a patient with LDS have 
never been reported before.A brief review of literature is also given here.

BACKGROUND: The role and sequencing of combination immuno-oncology (IO) therapy 
following progression on or after first-line IO therapy has not been 
well-established. The Fast Real-time Assessment of Combination Therapies in 
Immuno-ONcology (FRACTION) program is an open-label, phase 2 platform trial 
designed to evaluate multiple IO combinations in patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma (aRCC) who progressed during or after prior IO therapy. Here, we 
describe the results for patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. For 
enrollment in track 2 (reported here), patients with histologically confirmed 
clear cell aRCC, Karnofsky performance status ≥70%, and life expectancy ≥3 
months who had previously progressed after IO (anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1), 
anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 
(CTLA-4)) therapy were eligible. Previous treatment with anti-CTLA-4 therapy 
plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy precluded eligibility for enrollment in the 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm. Patients were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg 
every 4 weeks for up to 2 years or until progression, toxicity, or 
protocol-specified discontinuation. The primary outcome measures were objective 
response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival 
(PFS) rate at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were safety and tolerability up to 2 
years. Overall survival (OS) was a tertiary/exploratory endpoint. Overall, 46 
patients were included with a median follow-up of 33.8 months. The ORR was 17.4% 
(95% CI, 7.8 to 31.4) with eight (17.4%) patients achieving partial response. 
Stable disease was achieved in 19 (41.3%) patients, while 14 (30.4%) had 
progressive disease. Median DOR (range) was 16.4 (2.1+ to 27.0+) months. The PFS 
rate at 24 weeks was 43.2%, and median OS was 23.8 (95% CI, 13.2 to not reached) 
months. Grade 3-4 immune-mediated adverse events were reported in seven (15.2%) 
patients. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Patients with aRCC treated 
with nivolumab plus ipilimumab may derive durable clinical benefit after 
progression on previous IO therapies, including heavily pretreated patients, 
with a manageable safety profile that was consistent with previously published 
safety outcomes. These outcomes contribute to the knowledge of optimal 
sequencing of IO therapies for patients with aRCC with high unmet needs.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive, 
cholestatic liver disease which greatly impacts the lives of individuals. Burden 
of disease due to shortened life expectancy and impaired quality of life is 
ill-described. The aim of this study was to assess long-term disease burden in a 
large population-based registry with regard to survival, clinical course, 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs), medical consumption and work productivity 
loss.
METHODS: All PSC patients living in a geographically defined area covering ~50% 
of the Netherlands were included, together with patients from the three liver 
transplant centres. Survival was estimated by competing risk analysis. 
Proportional shortfall of QALYs during disease course was measured relative to a 
matched reference cohort using validated questionnaires. Work productivity loss 
and medical consumption were evaluated over time.
RESULTS: A total of 1208 patients were included with a median follow-up of 
11.2 year. Median liver transplant-free survival was 21.0 years. Proportional 
shortfall of QALYs increased to 48% >25 years after diagnosis. Patients had on 
average 12.4 hospital contact days among which 3.17 admission days per year, 
annual medical costs were €12 169 and mean work productivity loss was 25%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data quantify for the first time disease burden in terms of 
QALYs lost, clinical events, medical consumption, costs as well as work 
productivity loss, and show that all these are substantial and increase over 
time.

BACKGROUND: Data from the Global Burden of Disease, Injury, and Risk Factor 
Study 2019 (GBD 2019) was used to assess the burden and change in prevalence, 
incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years, and risk factors for atrial 
fibrillation/flutter in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: Incidence, prevalence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
and their age-standardized rates of AF/AFL were analyzed by age, sex, 
socio-demographic index (SDI), and human development index (HDI) using the 
Global Burden of Disease study 2019 (GBD2019) results，and risk factors for 
AF/AFL (mainly high systolic blood pressure, high body-mass index, alcohol use, 
smoking and diet high in sodium) were differentially analyzed.
RESULTS: There are 59.70 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 45.73-75.29 
million) AF/AFL patients worldwide in 2019, with 4.72 million (95% uncertainty 
interval (UI) 3.64-5.96 million) new cases and 0.315 million deaths (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) 0.268-0.361 million) and 8.39 million 
disability-adjusted years (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 6.69-10.54 million). 
The highest risk factor for deaths, DALYs attributable to AF/AFL in 2019 was 
high systolic blood pressure, high body-mass index, alcohol use, smoking, and 
diet high in sodium. It is estimated that between 2030 and 2034, the total 
incidence of male AF/ AFL will be 16.08 million, and the total number of deaths 
will be 1.01 million. For females, the total number of incidence is 16.85 
million, and the total number of deaths is 1.49 million.
CONCLUSIONS: AF/AFL remains a major global public health problem, although the 
ASR of prevalence, incidence, and DALY at the worldwide level showed a 
decreasing trend from 1990 to 2019(the ASR of deaths increased slightly). 
However, the unfavorable trend observed in this study in countries with lower 
SDI suggests that current prevention and treatment strategies should be 
reoriented. Some countries should develop more targeted and specific strategies 
to prevent the increase of AF/AFL.

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have in recent years evolved as a source of 
biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutic follow up. sEV samples derived 
from multicellular organisms exhibit a high heterogeneous repertoire of vesicles 
which current methods based on ensemble measurements cannot capture. In this 
work we present droplet barcode sequencing for protein analysis (DBS-Pro) to 
profile surface proteins on individual sEVs, facilitating identification of 
sEV-subtypes within and between samples. The method allows for analysis of 
multiple proteins through use of DNA barcoded affinity reagents and sequencing 
as readout. High throughput single vesicle profiling is enabled through 
compartmentalization of individual sEVs in emulsion droplets followed by droplet 
barcoding through PCR. In this proof-of-concept study we demonstrate that 
DBS-Pro allows for analysis of single sEVs, with a mixing rate below 2%. A total 
of over 120,000 individual sEVs obtained from a NSCLC cell line and from 
malignant pleural effusion (MPE) fluid of NSCLC patients have been analyzed 
based on their surface proteins. We also show that the method enables single 
vesicle surface protein profiling and by extension characterization of 
sEV-subtypes, which is essential to identify the cellular origin of vesicles in 
heterogenous samples.

BACKGROUND: Office workers who need to use a computer while maintaining a static 
position for prolonged periods have more chance of having low back pain (LBP).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of yoga on 
stress, anxiety, depression, and spinal mobility in computer users with chronic 
LBP (CLBP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized control trial, eighty computer users 
(42.6 ± 8.45 years of age; suffering from CLBP since 5.20 ± 3.01 years; 51 males 
and 29 females) who use a computer for their professional work, recruited from 
Bengaluru, India, were randomized into two groups: yoga group (n = 40) and 
physical exercise group (n = 40). The yoga group practiced an integrated module 
comprising yoga postures and mindfulness meditation, and the physical exercise 
group practiced physical exercise designed for LBP (1 h/day, 3 days/week for 16 
weeks). Assessments of dial-type goniometer and Depression Anxiety Stress 
Scale-42 were performed at baseline, after 8 weeks, and after 16 weeks.
RESULTS: Stress, anxiety, and depression scores were significantly lower in the 
yoga group as compared to the physical exercise group at 16 weeks (P < 0.001), 
whereas spinal flexion (P < 0.001), spinal extension (P < 0.001), right lateral 
flexion (P = 0.001), and left lateral flexion (P = 0.007) scores were 
significantly higher in the yoga group as compared to the physical exercise 
group at 16 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Yoga is more effective in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression 
and improving spinal mobility in computer users with CLBP than physical exercise 
designed for LBP.

BACKGROUND: From a demographic perspective, the impact of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on life expectancy is not clear. 
Hence, there is a need to study the number of years of life lost concerning the 
existing average life expectancy due to COVID-19 in India.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the impact of life expectancy due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic in India.
METHODOLOGY: We considered day-wise age-specific mortality due to COVID-19 which 
was extracted from the COVID-19 data repository from March 11, 2020, to June 30, 
2021, in India. All-cause mortality was collected from the United Nations 
population estimates. An abridged life table technique was utilized for 
calculating life expectancies based on all-cause mortality and mortality due to 
COVID-19. MortPak software was used to calculate the life expectancy with and 
without the COVID-19 pandemic. Life expectancy at birth in different age groups 
was estimated with respect to with and without COVID-19.
RESULTS: A total of 399,459 deaths due to COVID-19 were distributed age wise, 
and their corresponding life expectancy was calculated. The general mortality 
was compared with COVID-19 mortality for the various age groups, and it was 
observed that mortality due to COVID-19 was significantly higher among the 
elderly age group [i.e., 45 to 60 years (36%) and > 60 years (51%)] when 
compared with < 25 years (1%) and 26-44 years (11%) (trend Chi-square 7.59; p = 
0.001). The life expectancy without and with COVID-19 was 69.28 years and 69.16 
years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Overall, it was estimated that COVID-19 has an impact on life 
expectancy by 0.12 years during the study period. Even though mortality due to 
COVID-19 was high, factors such as lockdown, vaccination, and accidents also had 
an influence on mortality. Thus, there is a need to assess the impact of 
COVID-19 on life expectancy in future.

Pawpaw (Asimina triloba [L.] Dunal) is an underutilized fruit native to North 
America. The fruit has a short shelf life, and browns and softens rapidly after 
harvesting. These characteristics present a challenge to the advancement of 
pawpaw as an economically viable specialty crop. This study evaluated the 
physical characteristics of frozen fruits from eight cultivars of the pawpaw 
fruit to establish the processing potential of pawpaw fruits. The results show 
that freeze-thaw cycle may have influenced the peel thickness, peel color, and 
pulp color of the fruits. Fruits of the Susquehanna cultivar had the highest 
fruit weight and pulp weight, making them potentially the most suitable for pulp 
processing. The pawpaw fruits had almost neutral pH ranging between 6.07 ± 0.21 
and 6.47 ± 0.11, which could contribute to the rapid browning on exposure to air 
since an acidic pH is important for slowing enzymatic browning. To aid pawpaw 
juice extraction, enzymatic treatments may be necessary to increase the juice 
yield from the pulp. Overleese fruits may be the best for pawpaw juice 
production. These findings can aid in the selection of processing equipment and 
guide processors in their efforts to utilize pawpaw fruits to avoid postharvest 
and post-processing losses.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with recurrent endometrial cancer treated with carboplatin 
and paclitaxel whose disease progresses have few effective treatment options. 
Based on promising clinical trial data, the anti-programmed cell death 1 
(anti-PD-1) antibody dostarlimab was recently granted accelerated approval for 
endometrial cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration. We developed a 
decision model to examine the cost-effectiveness of dostarlimab for patients 
with progressive/recurrent deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) endometrial cancer 
whose disease has progressed with first-line chemotherapy.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness study.
POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of 6000 women with progressive/recurrent dMMR 
endometrial cancer.
METHODS: The initial decision point in the Markov model was treatment with 
dostarlimab, pembrolizumab or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). Model 
probabilities, and cost and utility values were derived with assumptions drawn 
from published literature. Effectiveness was estimated as average 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. One-way, two-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to vary the assumptions across a range of 
plausible values.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) was the least costly strategy, at 
$55,732, followed by dostarlimab ($151,533) and pembrolizumab ($154,597). Based 
on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, PLD was cost-effective 
compared with dostarlimab, with an ICER of $331,913 per QALY gained for 
dostarlimab, whereas pembrolizumab was ruled out by extended dominance (less 
effective, more costly), compared with dostarlimab. In one-way sensitivity 
analyses, dostarlimab was cost-effective when its cost was reduced to $4905 (52% 
reduction). These results were robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Dostarlimab is associated with greater survival compared with other 
treatments for women with recurrent dMMR endometrial cancer. Although the agent 
is substantially more costly, dostarlimab became cost-effective when its cost 
was reduced to $5489 per cycle.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To simulate the cost-effectiveness of Mesenchymal 
Stromal Cell (MSC) therapy compared to sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 
inhibitors (SGLT2i) or usual care (UC) in treating patients with Diabetic Kidney 
Disease (DKD).
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: This Markov-chain Monte Carlo 
model adopted a societal perspective and simulated 10,000 patients with DKD 
eligible for MSC therapy alongside UC using a lifetime horizon. This cohort was 
compared with an SGLT2i alongside UC arm and a UC only arm. Model input data 
were extracted from the literature. A threshold of $47,000 per quality-adjusted 
life year and a discount rate of 3% were used. The primary outcome measure was 
incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
examine: parameter uncertainty; threshold effects regarding MSC effectiveness 
and cost; and INMB according to patient age (71 vs 40 years), sex, and 
jurisdiction (UK, Italy and Ireland).
RESULTS: While MSC was more cost-effective than UC, both the UC and MSC arms 
were dominated by SLGT2i. Relative to SGLT2i, the INMB's for MSC and UC were 
-$4,158 and -$10,085 respectively indicating that SGLT2i, MSC and UC had a 64%, 
34% and 1% probability of being cost-effective at the given threshold, 
respectively. This pattern was consistent across most scenarios; driven by the 
relatively low cost of SGLT2i and demonstrated class-effect in delaying kidney 
failure and all-cause mortality. When examining younger patients at baseline, 
SGLT2i was still the most cost-effective but MSC performed better against UC 
given the increased lifetime benefit from delaying progression to ESRD.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base regarding the effectiveness of MSC therapy 
continues to evolve. The potential for these therapies to reverse kidney damage 
would see large improvements in their cost-effectiveness as would targeting such 
therapies at younger patients and/or those for whom SGLT2i is contra-indicated.

INTRODUCTION: Respiratory diseases (RD) are an important public health problem. 
Their burden has not been comprehensively evaluated in South America (SA). This 
study describes the burden of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in SA in 2019.
METHODOLOGY: This is an exploratory, population-based study with a quantitative 
approach to incidence, mortality, and Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by 
standardized age group among the 12 countries. Measurements were captured 
through the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) website. It used 
the Burden Study Global Disease, Injury and Risk Factors (GBD) 2019 assessment. 
Correlation analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate per 1,00,000 people for lower 
respiratory infections (LRIs) is lowest in Chile (3,902) and highest in Peru 
(9,997). For upper respiratory infections (URIs), Bolivia (2,25,826) had the 
lowest rates, while Brazil (3,16,667) and Colombia (3,06,302) had the highest. 
Standardized mortality rates for LRI were lowest in Colombia (15.10) and highest 
in Bolivia (80.53). Bolivia had the highest standardized DALY rate (2,083), 
while Uruguay had the lowest (468). Upper ARI had lower incidence rates than 
lower ARI. The lowest DALY rates were in Suriname (82) and the highest were in 
Brazil (111). There is a correlation between sociodemographic and economic 
health indicators and the standardized rates of incidence and DALY in the upper 
ARIs.
CONCLUSIONS: The present paper provides comprehensive ARI burden estimates for 
the region. The substantial incidence and considerable mortality and DALYs are 
noteworthy and lead to reflections on preventive measures such as rational use 
of antibiotics and deeper epidemiological investigations.

OBJECTIVE: The global increase in the "ultra-geriatric" population (aged 80 
years and older) has led to higher demand for neurosurgical procedures in this 
vulnerable population. The objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
advanced microsurgical procedures on ultra-geriatric patients, in our modern era 
of neurosurgery, anesthesiology, and advanced medical care.
METHODS: The study examined 66 complex cranial procedures, performed on 65 
ultra-geriatric patients, who constituted 3.8% of the 4461 consecutive 
neurosurgical procedures performed by a single neurosurgeon over 14-years in a 
tertiary care university hospital. Excluded from this study were intra- or 
extra-axial spontaneous hematomas or traumatic brain injuries, infections, 
biopsy-only cases and carotid endarterectomies.
RESULTS: The most common indication for surgery for the 66 complex cranial 
procedures were meningiomas (23.9%), followed by gliomas (17.9%), and metastatic 
brain tumors (17.9%). Postoperative complications occurred in seven procedures 
(10.60%). No patient deaths were directly caused by intra- or postoperative 
events, and only one 30-day mortality occurred. All deceased patients had a 
statistically significant higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
class (p = 0.024). However, there was no significant correlation between ASA
