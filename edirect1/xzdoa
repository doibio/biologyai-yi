particular, a genome-wide measurement of pausing times at high resolution has 
been lacking. We present here the time-variant precision nuclear run-on and 
sequencing (TV-PRO-seq) assay, an extension of the standard PRO-seq that allows 
us to estimate genome-wide pausing times at single-base resolution. Its 
application to human cells demonstrates that, proximal to promoters, polymerases 
pause more frequently but for shorter times than in other genomic regions. 
Comparison with single-cell gene expression data reveals that the polymerase 
pausing times are longer in highly expressed genes, while transcriptionally 
noisier genes have higher pausing frequencies and slightly longer pausing times. 
Analyses of histone modifications suggest that the marker H3K36me3 is related to 
the polymerase pausing.

Globally, there is an immense increase in the number of older adults. This can 
be attributed to an increase in life expectancy brought about by advances in 
general living standards as well as medicine and healthcare. However, exclusion 
which is linked to discrimination and access restrictions in areas such as 
education, employment, housing, and medical care has been identified as one of 
the challenges facing this increasing demographic. This study explored the 
exclusion of older rural women in southeast Nigeria and its impact on their life 
satisfaction. The study used a qualitative method of research to obtain data 
from a sample of 32 older adults aged 65 years and above through focus group 
discussions in Nru community in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State. The 
obtained data were thematically analyzed and the findings showed that many older 
rural women in the study area are socially excluded at home, churches, and the 
larger society, with poverty and stereotyping of older rural women as less 
intelligent identified as the leading factor predisposing them to social 
exclusion in Nigeria. Results also showed that social exclusion brings about 
sadness and depression which have severe negative implications on their life 
satisfaction. Finally, implications of the findings for gerontological social 
workers through advocacy geared toward changes in social policy and structures 
that promote ageism were discussed.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the global disease burden of uncorrected refractive 
error (URE) among adolescents and assess the contributions of various risk 
factors to disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to URE.
METHODS: Global, regional and country-level DALY numbers and rates due to URE 
among adolescents were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 
database. Human Development Index (HDI), Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) and other 
country-level data were obtained from other open databases as potential 
indicators. Regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between DALY 
rates among adolescents and potential predictors.
RESULTS: Global DALYs due to URE among adolescents rose by 8% between 1990 and 
2019 but moderately decreased by 4.8% during this period after adjusting for 
population size. Female adolescents showed higher DALY rates. DALY rates sharply 
increased from 5 to 9 years of age, then rose more slowly, reaching a plateau 
before 20 years of age. Country-level DALY rates in 2019 were positively 
associated with HDI, SDI, and urbanization rates but negatively correlated with 
primary school dropout rates. Higher disease burden of adolescents visually 
impaired from URE was associated with lower primary school dropout rates 
(β = - 0.257, 95% CI - 0.376 to - 0.138, P < 0.001) and higher urbanization 
rates (β = 0.257, 95% CI 0.067 to 0.256, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher socioeconomic status, urbanization rates and education 
levels are associated with a heavier disease burden of URE among adolescents. 
The findings of this study can provide a reference for policy making on resource 
allocation for URE prevention and control in teenagers.

BACKGROUND: The importance of the status of female health should have research 
priority due to the unique medical needs of women. Hence this paper attempts to 
explore the nexus of access to electricity, female education, and public health 
expenditure with female health outcomes in the SAARC-ASEAN countries.
METHODS: Using the data of 2002-2018, and applying the cross-sectional 
dependence test, Modified Wald test, Wooldridge test, the Panel corrected 
standard error (PCSE) model, the Feasible generalized least square (FGLS) model, 
and the pair-wise Granger causality test, the robust outcomes on female health 
are found.
RESULTS: Access to electricity, female education rate, public health 
expenditure, economic growth, and immunization rate, all have a positive effect 
on female life expectancy at birth, and a negative effect on the female adult 
mortality rate. The urbanization rate has a significantly positive impact on 
female life expectancy at birth but an insignificant impact on female adult 
mortality rate. The one-way causal relationship between the variables are also 
revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: All the results are rational and have important milestone for the 
health sector. The health status of females should be improved and protected by 
formulating effective policies on access to electricity, female education, 
public health expenditure, immunization, economic growth, and urbanization.

BACKGROUND: To measure the quality of care for lip and oral cavity cancer 
worldwide using the data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017.
METHODS: After devising four main indices of quality of care for lip and oral 
cavity cancer using GBD 2017 study's measures, including prevalence, incidence, 
years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life 
years, we utilised principal component analysis (PCA) to determine a component 
that bears the most proportion of info among the others. This component of the 
PCA was considered as the Quality-of-Care Index (QCI) for lip and oral cavity 
cancer. The QCI score was then reported in both men and women worldwide and 
different countries based on the socio-demographic index (SDI) and World Bank 
classifications.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2017, care quality continuously increased globally 
(from 53.7 to 59.6). In 1990, QCI was higher for men (53.5 for men compared with 
50.8 for women), and in 2017 QCI increased for both men and women, albeit a 
slightly higher rise for women (57.2 for men compared with 59.9 for women). 
During the same period, age-standardised QCI for lip and oral cavity cancer 
increased in all regions (classified by SDI and World Bank). Globally, the 
highest QCI scores were observed in the elderly age group, whereas the least 
were in the adult age group. Five countries with the least amount of QCIs were 
all African. In contrast, North American countries, West European countries and 
Australia had the highest indices.
CONCLUSION: The quality of care for lip and oral cavity cancer showed a rise 
from 1990 to 2017, a promising outcome that supports patient-oriented and 
preventive treatment policies previously advised in the literature. However, not 
all countries enjoyed such an increase in the QCI to the same extent. This 
alarming finding could imply a necessary need for better access to high-quality 
treatments for lip and oral cavity cancer, especially in central African 
countries and Afghanistan. More policies with a preventive approach and paying 
more heed to the early diagnosis, broad insurance coverage, and effective 
screening programs are recommended worldwide. More focus should also be given to 
the adulthood age group as they had the least QCI scores globally.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in 
Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. Our study objective was to assess 
similarities and differences in vaccine-impact projections through comparative 
modelling analysis by independently estimating the potential health impact of 
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination.
METHODS: Using two widely published models (Harvard and Papillomavirus Rapid 
Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME)) to estimate HPV vaccination 
impact, we simulated a vaccination scenario of 90% annual coverage among 10 
cohorts of 9-year-old girls from 2021 to 2030 in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and 
Pakistan. We estimated potential health impact in terms of cervical cancer 
cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life years averted among vaccinated 
cohorts from the time of vaccination until 2100. We harmonised the two models by 
standardising input data to comparatively estimate HPV vaccination impact.
RESULTS: Prior to harmonising model assumptions, the range between PRIME and 
Harvard models for number of cervical cancer cases averted by HPV vaccination 
was: 262 000 to 2 70 000 in Ethiopia; 1 640 000 to 1 970 000 in India; 330 000 
to 3 36 000 in Nigeria and 111 000 to 1 33 000 in Pakistan. When harmonising 
model assumptions, alignment on HPV type distribution significantly narrowed 
differences in vaccine-impact estimates.
CONCLUSION: Despite model differences, the Harvard and PRIME models yielded 
similar vaccine-impact estimates. The main differences in estimates are due to 
variation in interpretation around data on cervical cancer attribution to 
HPV-16/18. As countries make progress towards WHO targets for cervical cancer 
elimination, continued explorations of underlying differences in model inputs, 
assumptions and results when examining cervical cancer prevention policy will be 
critical.

The cost of testing can be a substantial contributor to hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
elimination program costs in many low- and middle-income countries such as 
Georgia, resulting in the need for innovative and cost-effective strategies for 
testing. Our objective was to investigate the most cost-effective testing 
pathways for scaling-up HCV testing in Georgia. We developed a Markov-based 
model with a lifetime horizon that simulates the natural history of HCV, and the 
cost of detection and treatment of HCV. We then created an interactive online 
tool that uses results from the Markov-based model to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of different HCV testing pathways. We compared the current 
standard-of-care (SoC) testing pathway and four innovative testing pathways for 
Georgia. The SoC testing was cost-saving compared to no testing, but all four 
new HCV testing pathways further increased QALYs and decreased costs. The 
pathway with the highest patient follow-up, due to on-site testing, resulted in 
the highest discounted QALYs (123 QALY more than the SoC) and lowest costs 
($127,052 less than the SoC) per 10,000 persons screened. The current testing 
algorithm in Georgia can be replaced with a new pathway that is more effective 
while being cost-saving.

BACKGROUND: To determine the priorities and resource allocation of community 
cancer-related health policies, it is necessary to measure cancer-related health 
indicators and the burden of cancer by region. This study calculated the 
cancer-free life expectancy at the eup/myeon/dong level (small administrative 
units in South Korea) for the first time, and analyzed its association with 
regional health insurance premiums.
METHODS: We used aggregate data from the 2008-2017 National Health Information 
Database provided by the National Health Insurance Service. Cancer-free life 
expectancy was calculated by applying Sullivan's method to mortality and cancer 
prevalence by age group and sex for the 10-year period in 3,396 
eups/myeons/dongs. Correlation analyses were performed to analyze the 
relationship between cancer-free life expectancy and regional health insurance 
premiums.
RESULTS: Cancer-free life expectancy in eups/myeons/dongs of metropolitan areas 
tended to be higher than in non-metropolitan areas. However, some 
eups/myeons/dongs of non-metropolitan areas showed quite a high cancer-free life 
expectancy, especially for females. The median values of differences between 
cancer-free life expectancy and life expectancy at the eup/myeon/dong level 
(total: 1.6 years, male: 1.8 years, female: 1.4 years) indicated that a person's 
healthy life can be shortened by a number of years due to cancer. The 
association of cancer-free life expectancy by eup/myeon/dong with the regional 
health insurance premium was statistically significant (β = 1.0, P < 0.001) and 
more prominent for males (β = 1.3, P < 0.001) than for females (β = 0.5, P < 
0.001). The relationship between the regional health insurance premium and the 
burden of cancer (life expectancy minus cancer-free life expectancy) was also 
statistically significant (β = 0.2 for the total population, β = 0.2 for males, 
and β = 0.1 for females, all P values < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant regional gap with regard to 
cancer-free life expectancy and the burden of cancer at the eup/myeon/dong 
level. This work makes a meaningful contribution by presenting new and firsthand 
summary measures of cancer-related health across small areas in Korea. The 
results will also help the authorities to evaluate the effectiveness of local 
cancer management projects in small administrative areas and determine regional 
priorities for implementing cancer control policies.

BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-31 affects the inflammatory response, is involved 
in epidermal barrier disruption in atopic dermatitis (AD) and plays a key role 
in pruritus. Nemolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-31 receptor 
A, reduced pruritus in patients with AD after a 16-week administration period.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-term effectiveness and safety of nemolizumab in 
patients aged ≥ 13 years with AD and inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe 
pruritus.
METHODS: In two long-term phase III studies, nemolizumab 60 mg every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) was administered subcutaneously, concomitantly with topical treatments. 
Study-JP01 patients received double-blind nemolizumab or placebo for 16 weeks, 
and then entered a 52-week extension period in which all patients received 
nemolizumab (nemolizumab/nemolizumab and placebo/nemolizumab groups). Study-JP02 
patients received nemolizumab for 52 weeks. Both studies included an 8-week 
follow-up period.
RESULTS: Study-JP01 nemolizumab/nemolizumab and placebo/nemolizumab, and 
Study-JP02 nemolizumab groups comprised 143, 72 and 88 patients, respectively. 
In the nemolizumab/nemolizumab group, there were clinically meaningful 
improvements from the start of treatment to week 68 in the pruritus visual 
analogue scale (66% decrease) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (78% decrease). 
Quality of life (QoL) indicators improved after the first nemolizumab dose; 
improvements were maintained during the follow-up period. The long-term safety 
profile was consistent with previous studies, with no unexpected late-onset 
adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Nemolizumab 60 mg Q4W with concomitant topical treatments in 
patients with AD and inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe pruritus 
produced a continuous improvement in pruritus, signs of AD, and QoL for up to 
68 weeks, with a favourable safety profile.

IMPORTANCE: This randomized clinical trial examines the feasibility and 
acceptability of a decision-making tool for increasing patient interest in 
individualized recommendations for preventive care services.
OBJECTIVE: To pilot a tool to help patients compare life expectancy gains from 
evidence-based preventive services.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial examined 
patient and physician responses to a pilot decision tool incorporating 
personalized risk factors at 3 US primary care clinics between 2017 and 2020. 
Eligible patients were between ages 45 to 70 years with 2 or more high-risk 
factors. Patients were followed-up after 1 year.
INTERVENTIONS: The gain in life expectancy associated with guideline adherence 
to each recommended preventive service was estimated. Personalized estimates 
incorporating risk factors in electronic health records were displayed in a 
physician-distributed visual aid. During development, physicians discussed 
individualized results with patients using shared decision-making (SDM). During 
the trial, patients were randomized to receive individualized recommendations or 
usual care (nonmasked, parallel, 1:1 ratio).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was patient interest in 
individualized recommendations, assessed by survey. Secondary outcomes were use 
of SDM, decisional comfort, readiness to change, and preventive services 
received within 1 year.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 104 patients (31 development, 39 intervention, 34 
control), of whom 101 were included in analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [5.3] 
years; 73 [72.3%] women; 80 [79.2%] Black patients) and 20 physicians. 
Intervention patients found the tool helpful and wanted to use it again, rating 
it a median 9 of 10 (IQR, 8-10) and 10 of 10 (8-10), respectively. Compared with 
the control group, intervention patients more often correctly identified the 
service least likely (18 [46%] vs 0; P = .03) to improve their life expectancy. 
A greater number of patients also identified the service most likely to improve 
their life expectancy (26 [69%] vs 10 [30%]; P = .07), although this result was 
not statistically significant. Intervention patients reported greater mean [SD] 
improvement in SDM (4.7 [6.9] points) and near-term readiness to change (13.8 
points for top-3-ranked recommendations). Point estimates indicated that 
patients in the intervention group experienced greater, although

INTRODUCTION: Underestimation of zoonoses is exacerbated in low and 
middle-income countries due mainly to inequalities with serious consequences in 
healthcare. This is difficult to gauge and reduce the impact of those diseases. 
Our study focuses on Paraguay, where the livestock industry is one of the major 
components of the country's economy. Therefore, the rationale of this study was 
to develop a case study in Paraguay to estimate the dual impact of zoonotic 
diseases on both the human health and animal health sector and thus determine 
the societal burden of such diseases.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a systemic review (including a 
meta-analysis) to assess the burden of zoonoses in Paraguay, including official 
reports and grey literature of disease incidence and prevalence. We estimated 
the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and Zoonosis Disability Adjusted Life 
Years (zDALYs) to measure the difference between the current health status and 
the desired health situation of animals and the Paraguayan population based on 
50 zoonotic diseases suggested by the WHO (World Health Organization), OIE 
(World Organization for Animal Health) and the National Health in Paraguay. The 
total DALYs represent 19,384 (95% CI: from 15,805 to 29,733), and zDALYs, 62,178 
(95% CI: from 48,696 to 77,188). According to the results, the priority 
pathogens for DALYs are E. coli, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania spp, and 
Toxoplasma gondii. When we include the additional animal health burden, the most 
important pathogens are Brucella spp, E. coli, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Fasciola 
hepatica for zDALYs.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to integrate DALYs and zDALYs 
with important clues related to the health status of Paraguay. Through DALYs and 
zDALYs, our perspective becomes more complete because we consider not only human 
health but also animal health. This is important for setting priorities in 
disease control, especially in a society where livestock contribute 
significantly to the economy and to human well-being.

Germany: A cohort study.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that people who abstain from alcohol have a higher 
mortality rate than those who drink low to moderate amounts. However, little is 
known about factors that might be causal for this finding. The objective was to 
analyze former alcohol or drug use disorders, risky drinking, tobacco smoking, 
and fair to poor health among persons who reported abstinence from alcohol 
drinking in the last 12 months before baseline in relation to total, 
cardiovascular, and cancer mortality 20 years later.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A sample of residents aged 18 to 64 years had been drawn 
at random among the general population in northern Germany and a standardized 
interview conducted in the years 1996 to 1997. The baseline assessment included 
4,093 persons (70.2% of those who had been eligible). Vital status and death 
certificate data were retrieved in the years 2017 and 2018. We found that among 
the alcohol-abstinent study participants at baseline (447), there were 405 
(90.60%) former alcohol consumers. Of the abstainers, 322 (72.04%) had met one 
or more criteria for former alcohol or drug dependence or abuse, alcohol risky 
drinking, or had tried to cut down or to stop drinking, were daily smokers, or 
self-rated their health as fair to poor. Among the abstainers with one or more 
of these risk factors, 114 (35.40%) had an alcohol use disorder or risky alcohol 
consumption in their history. Another 161 (50.00%) did not have such an 
alcohol-related risk but were daily smokers. The 322 alcohol-abstinent study 
participants with one or more of the risk factors had a shorter time to death 
than those with low to moderate alcohol consumption. The Cox proportional hazard 
ratio (HR) was 2.44 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.68 to 3.56) for persons who 
had one or more criteria for an alcohol or drug use disorder fulfilled in their 
history and after adjustment for age and sex. The 125 alcohol-abstinent persons 
without these risk factors (27.96% of the abstainers) did not show a 
statistically significant difference from low to moderate alcohol consumers in 
total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. Those who had stayed alcohol 
abstinent throughout their life before (42; 9.40% of the alcohol-abstinent study 
participants at baseline) had an HR 1.64 (CI 0.72 to 3.77) compared to low to 
moderate alcohol consumers after adjustment for age, sex, and tobacco smoking. 
Main limitations of this study include its reliance on self-reported data at 
baseline and the fact that only tobacco smoking was analyzed as a risky behavior 
alongside alcohol consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the alcohol abstainers at baseline were former 
alcohol consumers and had risk factors that increased the likelihood of early 
death. Former alcohol use disorders, risky alcohol drinking, ever having smoked 
tobacco daily, and fair to poor health were associated with early death among 
alcohol abstainers. Those without an obvious history of these risk factors had a 
life expectancy similar to that of low to moderate alcohol consumers. The 
findings speak against recommendations to drink alcohol for health reasons.

Recent advancements in the field of immune-oncology have led to a significant 
increase in life expectancy of patients with diverse forms of cancer, such as 
hematologic malignancies, melanoma and lung cancer. Unfortunately, these 
encouraging results are not observed in the majority of patients, who remain 
unresponsive and/or encounter adverse events. Currently, researchers are 
collecting more insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie 
these variable responses. As an example, the human lymphocyte activation gene-3 
(huLAG-3), an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor, is increasingly studied as 
a therapeutic target in immune-oncology. Noninvasive molecular imaging of the 
immune checkpoint programmed death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1 has 
shown its value as a strategy to guide and monitor PD-1/PD-L1-targeted immune 
checkpoint therapy. Yet, radiotracers that allow dynamic, whole body imaging of 
huLAG-3 expression are not yet described. We here developed single-domain 
antibodies (sdAbs) that bind huLAG-3 and showed that these sdAbs can image 
huLAG-3 in tumors, therefore representing promising tools for further 
development into clinically applicable radiotracers.

OBJECTIVE: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated 
its eligibility criteria for unilateral cochlear implants (UCIs) in 2019. NICE 
claimed this would not impact the cost-effectiveness results used within its 
2009 technology appraisal guidance. This claim is uncertain given changed 
clinical practice and increased healthcare unit costs. Our objective was to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness estimates of UCIs in UK adults with severe to 
profound hearing loss within the contemporary NHS environment.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis employing a Markov model was undertaken to 
compare UCIs with hearing aids or no hearing aids for people with severe to 
profound hearing loss. A clinical pathway was developed to estimate resource 
use. Health-related quality of life, potential adverse events, device upgrades 
and device failure were captured. Unit costs were derived mostly from the NHS 
data. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis further assessed the effect of 
uncertain model inputs.
RESULTS: A UCI is likely to be deemed cost-effective when compared to a hearing 
aid (£11,946/QALY) or no hearing aid (£10,499/QALY). A UCI has an 93.0% and 
98.7% likelihood of being cost-effective within the UK adult population when 
compared to a hearing aid or no hearing aid, respectively. ICERs were mostly 
sensitive to the proportion of people eligible for cochlear implant, discount 
rate, surgery and device costs and processor upgrade cost.
CONCLUSION: UCIs remain cost-effective despite changes to clinical practice and 
increased healthcare unit costs. Updating the NICE criteria to provide better 
access UCIs is projected to increase annual implants in adults and children by 
70% and expenditure by £28.6 million within three years. This increased access 
to UCIs will further improve quality of life of recipients and overall social 
welfare.

Aging happens to all of us as we live. Thanks to the improved living standard 
and discovery of life-saving medicines, our life expectancy has increased 
substantially across the world in the past century. However, the rise in 
lifespan leads to unprecedented increases in both the number and the percentage 
of individuals 65 years and older, accompanied by the increased incidences of 
age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. 
FoxO transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved molecules that play 
critical roles in diverse biological processes, in particular aging and 
metabolism. Their dysfunction is often found in the pathogenesis of many 
age-related diseases. Here, we summarize the signaling pathways and cellular 
functions of FoxO proteins. We also review the complex role of FoxO in aging and 
age-related diseases, with focus on type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and 
discuss the possibility of FoxO as a molecular link between aging and disease 
risks.

BACKGROUND: Severe and refractory immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) affects the life 
expectancy of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and poses a 
challenge in their clinical management. This intervention study employed a small 
sample size to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a modified low-dose rituximab 
(RTX) regimen in patients with SLE-associated refractory ITP.
METHODS: Eight patients with severe SLE-associated refractory ITP were enrolled 
in this intervention study. They received an infusion of intravenous RTX 
(200 mg) on days 1 and 15. The dose of corticosteroids (prescribed previously) 
was gradually tapered, and immunosuppressants were withdrawn. Patients were 
followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; platelet counts, other laboratory 
indicators, and side effects were recorded. We used intention-to-treat analysis 
to calculate the response rate.
RESULTS: Seven participants (87.5%) completed the study. At 1 month, two 
patients (25.0%) achieved partial response (PR); the PR rate increased to 87.5% 
at 3 months. At 6 months, three patients (37.5%) achieved complete response 
(CR). However, the CR rate dropped to 25.0% at 12 months. The overall responses 
(ORs) were 25.0% (2/8), 87.5% (7/8), 75.0%(6/8), and 75.0%(6/8) at 1, 3, 6, and 
12 months, respectively. Two patients developed a mild infusion reaction and one 
discontinued the study due to herpes zoster virus infection and an allergic 
reaction 2 weeks after the first dose of RTX.
CONCLUSION: Modified low-dose RTX therapy (two infusions of 200 mg every 
2 weeks) could be a promising new option for patients with SLE-associated 
refractory ITP with a satisfactory response rate.

Building back fairer in Greater Manchester and the country.

Marmot M(1).

Author information:

University College London, London, UK.

A summary of our analyses in Greater Manchester (GM), and the northwest (NW) 
region, might be: the NW is like England as a whole only more so. The life 
expectancy drop in England in 2020 was 1.2 years in men and 0.9 years in 
women-shocking, but not as high as in the NW. COVID-19 mortality rates were high 
in England; 25% higher in the NW. Inequalities in mortality are high in England; 
bigger in the NW. The title, Build Back Fairer, is a deliberate echo of the 
Build Back Better mantra, showing that the levels of social, environmental and 
economic inequality in society are damaging health and well-being. As the UK 
emerges from the pandemic, it would be a tragic mistake to re-establish the 
status quo that existed pre-pandemic-a status quo marked in England, over the 
decade from 2010, by a stagnation of health improvement that was more marked 
than in any rich country other than Iceland and the USA; by widening health 
inequalities; and by a fall in life expectancy in the most deprived 10% of areas 
outside London. That stagnation, those social and regional inequalities, and 
deterioration in health for the most deprived people are markers of a society 
that is not meeting the needs of its members.

Background Patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) are considered at high risk 
of infective endocarditis (IE) as a result of altered hemodynamics and multiple 
invasive procedures, including pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). Data on the 
long-term risk of IE are sparse. Methods and Results In this observational 
cohort study, all patients with ToF born from 1977 to 2018 were identified using 
Danish nationwide registries and followed from date of birth until occurrence of 
first-time IE, emigration, death, or end of study (December 31, 2018). The 
comparative risk of IE among patients with ToF versus age- and sex-matched 
controls from the background population was assessed. Because of rules on 
anonymity, exact numbers cannot be reported if the number of patients is <4. A 
total of 1164 patients with ToF were identified and matched with 4656 controls. 
Among patients with ToF, 851 (73.1%) underwent early surgical intracardiac 
repair and 276 (23.7%) underwent PVR during follow-up. During a median follow-up 
of 20.3 years, 41 (3.5%) patients with ToF (comprising 24 [8.7%] with PVR and 17 
[1.9%] without PVR) and <4 (<0.8%) controls were admitted with IE. The incidence 
rates of IE per 10 000 person-years were 22.4 (95% CI, 16.5-30.4) and 0.1 (95% 
CI, 0.01-0.7) among patients and controls, respectively. Moreover, PVR was 
associated with a further increased incidence of IE among patients with ToF 
(incidence rates per 10 000 person-years with and without PVR were 46.7 [95% CI, 
25.1-86.6] and 2.8 [95% CI 2.0-4.0], respectively). Conclusions Patients with 
ToF are associated with a substantially higher incidence of IE than the 
background population. In particular, PVR was associated with an increased 
incidence of IE. With an increasing life expectancy of these patients, 
intensified awareness, preventive measures, and surveillance of this patient 
group are decisive.

Individuals with schizophrenia have a reduced life-expectancy compared to the 
general population, largely due to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Clinical and epidemiological studies have been unable to unravel the 
nature of this relationship. We obtained summary-data of genome-wide-association 
studies of schizophrenia (N = 130 644), heart failure (N = 977 323), coronary 
artery disease (N = 332 477), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (N = 757 
601), heart rate variability (N = 46 952), QT interval (N = 103 331), early 
repolarization and dilated cardiomyopathy ECG patterns (N = 63 700). We computed 
genetic correlations and conducted bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) 
to assess causality. With multivariable MR, we investigated whether causal 
effects were mediated by smoking, body mass index, physical activity, lipid 
levels, or type 2 diabetes. Genetic correlations between schizophrenia and CVD 
were close to zero (-0.02-0.04). There was evidence that liability to 
schizophrenia causally increases heart failure risk. This effect remained 
consistent with multivariable MR. There was also evidence that liability to 
schizophrenia increases early repolarization pattern, largely mediated by BMI 
and lipids. Finally, there was evidence that liability to schizophrenia 
increases heart rate variability, a direction of effect contrasting clinical 
studies. There was weak evidence that higher systolic blood pressure increases 
schizophrenia risk. Our finding that liability to schizophrenia increases heart 
failure is consistent with the notion that schizophrenia involves a systemic 
dysregulation of the body with detrimental effects on the heart. To decrease 
cardiovascular mortality among individuals with schizophrenia, priority should 
lie with optimal treatment in early stages of psychosis.
