Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by 
aberrant myeloid lineage hematopoiesis with excessive red blood cell and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Patients with PV present with a range of 
thrombotic and hemorrhagic symptoms that affect quality of life and reduce 
overall survival expectancy. Thrombotic events, transformation into acute 
myeloid leukemia, and myelofibrosis are largely responsible for the observed 
mortality. Treatment of PV is thus primarily focused on symptom control and 
survival extension through the prevention of thrombosis and leukemic 
transformation. Patients with PV frequently experience thrombotic events and 
have elevated cardiovascular risk, including hypertension, dyslipidemias, 
obesity, and smoking, all of which negatively affect survival. To reduce the 
risk of thrombotic complications, PV therapy should aim to normalize hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, and leukocytosis and, in addition, identify and modify 
cardiovascular risk factors. Herein, we review what is currently known about the 
associated cardiovascular risk and propose strategies for diagnosing and 
managing patients with PV.

With the improving life expectancy of patients with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), there is an increasing health concern of potential toxicity and drug 
interactions of long-term antiretroviral therapies. We describe a female patient 
with HIV, who was admitted to the emergency department following an unexplained 
loss of consciousness. This patient had been on antiretroviral therapy 
comprising tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and lopinavir/ritonavir 
for 12 years. Coincidentally, she had been prescribed terfenadine for urticaria 
recently. After 3 days on this medication, she suddenly lost her consciousness, 
with a distinctive electrocardiogram alteration characterized by QT prolongation 
and torsade de pointes. This symptom recurred several times over a span of 
2 days. We postulate that the primary instigator was an elevated concentration 
of terfenadine, which can be traced back to her antiretroviral therapy regimen 
comprising lopinavir/ritonavir. This drug is known to impede the metabolism of 
cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates and consequently elevate terfenadine 
concentrations.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a prevalent global disorder 
of the upper digestive tract characterized by functional impairment. It often 
coexists with anxiety/depression, significantly impairing occupational 
productivity and overall quality of life. This study aimed to identify emerging 
patterns and prominent themes within FD and anxiety/depression research through 
bibliometric analysis to help explore new innovative avenues for investigating 
this type of FD.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of literature encompassing FD and 
anxiety/depression was conducted using the Science Citation Index Extension of 
the Web of Science Core Collection from 2003 to 2023. Information extracted 
comprised "Full Record and Cited References." Bibliometric analysis of relevant 
publications, including country, institution, author, journal, citations, and 
keywords, was conducted using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix package in 
R and Excel.
RESULTS: Studies related to FD and anxiety/depression have demonstrated an 
ascending trajectory since 2003. Our bibliometric analysis identified 338 
studies published by 2023. NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY emerged as the 
most prolific journal, while GASTROENTEROLOGY retained pre-eminence within the 
top 10 published journals. China emerged as the most prolific country, with two 
institutions within the top 10 in terms of volume of publications. The Mayo 
Clinic stood as the foremost institution in terms of publication volume, with 
the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine exhibiting robust 
collaborative engagement. Eminent author influence was attributed to Talley NJ 
of Newcastle University, Australia. Clusters of extensively cited papers and 
prevalent keywords delineate the status and trend of FD and anxiety/depression 
research. This encompasses FD, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and 
functional gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the timeline view map or 
trend-term analysis suggested that duodenal low-grade inflammation ("duodenal 
eosinophilia" and "mast cells") might be a new concern associated with FD and 
anxiety/depression.
CONCLUSION: Employing bibliometric analysis, this study revealed prevalent focal 
areas and new trends within FD and anxiety/depression research. These insights 
serve as valuable guidance for scholars seeking to delve into new research 
avenues.

Diabetes has emerged as one the leading detrimental factors for human life 
expectancy worldwide. The disease is mainly considered as outcome of 
dysregulation in glucose metabolism, resulting in consistent high glucose 
concentration in blood. At initial stages, the diabetes particularly type 2 
diabetes, is manageable by lifestyle interventions such as regular physical 
activity and diet with less carbohydrates. However, in advance stage, regular 
intake of external insulin dose and medicines like metformin are recommended. 
The long-term consumption of metformin is associated with several side effects 
such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, lectic acidosis etc., In this scenario, 
several plant-based medicines have shown promising potential for the prevention 
and treatment of diabetes. Berberine is the bioactive compound present in the 
different plant parts of berberis family. Biochemical studies have shown that 
berberine improve insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Additionally, 
berberine induces glucose metabolism by activating AMPK signaling and inhibition 
of inflammation. A series of studies have demonstrated the antidiabetic 
potential of berberine at in vitro, pre-clinical and clinical trials. This 
review provides comprehensive details of preventive and therapeutic potential of 
berberine against diabetes.

The word extreme events refer to unnatural or undesirable events. Due to the 
general destructive effects on society and scientific problems in various 
applied fields, the study of extreme events is an important subject for 
researchers. Many real-life phenomena exhibit clusters of extreme observations 
that cannot be adequately predicted and modeled by the traditional 
distributions. Therefore, we need new flexible probability distributions that 
are useful in modeling extreme-value data in various fields such as the 
financial sector, telecommunications, hydrology, engineering, and meteorology. 
In this piece of research work, a new flexible probability distribution is 
introduced, which is attained by joining together the flexible Weibull 
distribution with the weighted T-X strategy. The new model is named a new 
flexible Weibull extension distribution. The distributional properties of the 
new model are derived. Furthermore, some frequently implemented estimation 
approaches are considered to obtain the estimators of the new flexible Weibull 
extension model. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the new flexible Weibull 
extension distribution by analyzing an extreme value data set.

In recent years, the interrelationships between the environment, energy, and 
health have received a growing amount of attention due to their substantial 
impact on the health of humans. By examining what influences Eastern Europeans' 
longevity between 1990 and 2021, this study hopes to contribute to this field of 
study. Energy consumption, health expenditure, pollution, institutional quality 
index (IQI), financial development, and other attributes profoundly impact human 
health. Because of the extensive network of commerce, tourism, education, 
religion, and treaties connecting East European countries, tests for 
cross-sectional dependence (CSD) and slope heterogeneity (SH) are utilized. 
After verifying the CSD and SH issues, the study uses the second generation's 
unit root and cointegration tests. As the previous test indicates, a new panel 
method, the cross-sectional autoregressive distributive lag (CS-ARDL) model, is 
required, as conventional estimations are inappropriate. The Quantile Regression 
(QR) method is also applied to check robustness. This study indicated that 
increased health expenditure, renewable energy consumption, and IQI improves 
health outcomes in Eastern European nations. There was a good connection between 
renewable energy consumption and health benefits, the study concluded. Though 
financial development positively impacts life expectancy, the impact is 
insignificant. On the other hand, the study also shows that CO2 emissions and 
fossil fuel consumption decrease life expectancy. These results are consistent 
with those obtained using the QR method. To enhance health outcomes, it is 
necessary to take measures to raise health spending, increase the use of 
renewable energy, and foster financial development over the long term. On the 
other hand, Eastern European nations need to shift their attention from fossil 
fuels to renewable energy.

We have previously shown that in the developing trunk of zebrafish embryos, 
two-pore channel type 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca2+ release from endolysosomes plays a 
role in the formation of the skeletal slow muscle. In addition, TPC2-mediated 
Ca2+ signaling is required for axon extension and the establishment of 
synchronized activity in the primary motor neurons. Here, we report that TPC2 
might also play a role in the development of the notochord of zebrafish embryos. 
For example, when tpcn2 was knocked down or out, increased numbers of small 
vacuoles were formed in the inner notochord cells, compared with the single 
large vacuole in the notochord of control embryos. This abnormal vacuolation was 
associated with embryos displaying attenuated body axis straightening. We also 
showed that TPC2 has a distinct pattern of localization in the notochord in 
embryos at ∼24 hpf. Finally, we conducted RNAseq to identify differentially 
expressed genes in tpcn2 mutants compared to wild-type controls, and found that 
those involved in actin filament severing, cellular component morphogenesis, 
Ca2+ binding, and structural constituent of cytoskeleton were downregulated in 
the mutants. Together, our data suggest that TPC2 activity plays a key role in 
notochord biogenesis in zebrafish embryos.

Cemiplimab combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer: an updated EMPOWER-Lung 3 trial-based cost-effectiveness 
analysis.

OBJECTIVE: Cemiplimab combined with chemotherapy has emerged as a promising 
treatment option for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accordingly, 
this study has been conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this 
combination therapy in comparison to chemotherapy alone from the perspective of 
the United States healthcare system.
METHODS: The present study is based on a partitioned survival model developed 
from clinical data obtained during the 2-year follow-up of the phase III 
EMPOWER-Lung 3 part 2 trial. The purpose of this investigation is to estimate 
the 10-year life expectancy and total healthcare costs of patients with advanced 
NSCLC by leveraging primary outcomes that evaluated costs, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).To establish the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold for the analysis, a value of $150,000/QALY 
was adopted. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of 
varying levels of uncertainty on the results of this study.
RESULTS: When compared to chemotherapy alone, the addition of cemiplimab to 
chemotherapy has been demonstrated to result in an incremental gain of 1.593 
QALY at an additional cost of $109351.298. This equates to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $68644.883/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses 
were conducted on the model, which acknowledged the influence of several 
parameters, such as subsequent costs, the utility of progressive disease, the 
cost of best supportive care, the cost of cemiplimab per mg, and the utility of 
progression-free survival on the outcomes. Nonetheless, none of these parameters 
yielded an ICER lower than the WTP threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the United States healthcare system, the 
utilization of cemiplimab in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line 
treatment option for NSCLC appears to be a cost-effective approach as compared 
to using chemotherapy as a standalone therapy.

Therapy-related Myeloid Neoplasm (t-MN) represents one of the worst long-term 
consequences of cytotoxic therapy for primary tumors and autoimmune disease. 
Poor survival and refractoriness to current treatment strategies characterize 
affected patients from a clinical point of view. In our aging societies, where 
newer therapies and ameliorated cancer management protocols are improving the 
life expectancy of cancer patients, therapy-related Myeloid Neoplasms are an 
emerging problem. Although several research groups have contributed to 
characterizing the main risk factors in t-MN development, the multiplicity of 
primary tumors, in association with the different therapeutic strategies 
available and the new drugs in development, make interpreting the current data 
still complex. The main risk factors involved in t-MN pathogenesis can be 
subgrouped into patient-specific, inherited, and acquired predispositions. 
Although t-MN can occur at any age, the risk tends to increase with advancing 
age, and older patients, characterized by a higher number of comorbidities, are 
more likely to develop the disease. Thanks to the availability of deep 
sequencing techniques, germline variants have been reported in 15-20% of t-MN 
patients, highlighting their role in cancer predisposition. It is becoming 
increasingly evident that t-MN with driver gene mutations may arise in the 
background of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) under the 
positive selective pressure of chemo and/or radiation therapies. Although CHIP 
is generally considered benign, it has been associated with an increased risk of 
t-MN. In this context, the phenomenon of clonal evolution may be described as a 
dynamic process of expansion of preexisting clones, with or without acquisition 
of additional genetic alterations, that, by favoring the proliferation of more 
aggressive and/or resistant clones, may play a crucial role in the progression 
from preleukemic states to t-MN.

Case Report: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with recurrent episodes of ventricular 
fibrillation and concurrent sinus arrest.

BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a serious hereditary 
cardiomyopathy. It is characterized morphologically by an increased left 
ventricular wall thickness and mass and functionally by enhanced global chamber 
function and myocellular contractility, diastolic dysfunction, and myocardial 
fibrosis development. Typically, patients with HCM experience atrial 
fibrillation (AF), syncope, and ventricular fibrillation (VF), causing severe 
symptoms and cardiac arrest. In contrast, sinoatrial node (SAN) arrest in the 
setting of HCM is uncommon. In particular, during VF, it has not been described 
so far.
CASE SUMMARY: In this study, we report an 18-year-old woman patient with sudden 
cardiac arrest due to VF and successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation as the 
first clinical manifestation of non-obstructive HCM. Subsequently, a 
subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted for 
secondary VF prophylaxis. However, additional episodes of VF occurred. During 
these, device interrogation revealed a combined occurrence of VF, bradycardia, 
and SAN arrest, requiring a device exchange into a dual-chamber ICD. A 
heterozygous, pathogenic variant of the MYH7 gene (c.2155C>T; p.Arg719Trp) was 
identified as causative for HCM.
DISCUSSION: First published in 1994, the particular MYH7 variant (p.Arg719Trp) 
was described in HCM patients with a high incidence of premature cardiac death 
and a reduced life expectancy. Electrophysiological studies on HCM patients are 
mainly performed to treat AF and ventricular tachycardia. Further extraordinary 
arrhythmic phenotypes were reported only in a few HCM patients. Taken together, 
the present case with documented co-existing VF and SAN arrest is rare and also 
emphasizes addressing the presence of SAN arrest (in particular, during VF 
episodes) in HCM patients when a distinct ICD device is considered for 
implantation.

Can Antidiabetic Medications Affect Telomere Length in Patients with Type 2 
Diabetes? A Mini-Review.

University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.

The fight against aging is an eternal pursuit of humankind. The aging rate of 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is higher than that of healthy 
individuals. Reducing the aging rate of patients with T2DM and extending their 
life expectancy are challenges that endocrinologists are eager to overcome. Many 
studies have shown that antidiabetic medications have potent anti-aging 
potential. Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences located at the ends of 
chromosomes, and telomere shortening is a hallmark of aging. This review 
summarizes clinical trials that have explored the association between 
antidiabetic medications and telomere length (TL) in patients with T2DM and 
explore the mystery of delaying aging in patients with T2DM from the perspective 
of telomeres. Various antidiabetic medications may have different effects on TL 
in patients with T2DM. Metformin and sitagliptin may protect telomeres in 
patients with T2DM, while exogenous insulin may promote telomere shortening in 
patients with T2DM. The effect of acarbose and glyburide on TL in patients with 
T2DM is still uncertain due to the absence of evidence from longitudinal 
studies.

BACKGROUND: BRAF+MEK inhibitors extend life expectancy of patients with BRAFV600 
mutant advanced melanoma. Acquired resistance limits duration of benefit, but 
preclinical and case studies suggest intermittent dosing could overcome this 
limitation. INTERIM was a phase 2 trial evaluating an intermittent dosing 
regimen.
METHODS: Patients with BRAFV600 mutant advanced melanoma due to start 
dabrafenib+trametinib were randomised to receive either continuous (CONT), or 
intermittent (INT; dabrafenib d1-21, trametinib d1-14 every 28 days) dosing. A 
composite primary endpoint included progression-free survival (PFS) and quality 
of life (QoL). Secondary endpoints included response rate (ORR), overall 
survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs). Mutant BRAFV600E ctDNA was measured by 
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), using mutant allele frequency of > 1 % as the 
detection threshold.
RESULTS: 79 patients (39 INT, 40 CONT) were recruited; median age 67 years, 65 % 
AJCC (7th ed) stage IV M1c, 29 % had brain metastases. With 19 months median 
follow-up, INT was inferior in all efficacy measures: median PFS 8.5 vs 10.7mo 
(HR 1.39, 95 %CI 0.79-2.45, p = 0.255); median OS 18.1mo vs not reached (HR 
1.69, 95 %CI 0.87-3.28, p = 0.121), ORR 57 % vs 77 %. INT patients experienced 
fewer treatment-related AEs (76 % vs 88 %), but more grade > 3 AEs (53 % vs 42 
%). QoL favoured CONT. Detection of BRAFV600E ctDNA prior to treatment 
correlated with worse OS (HR 2.55, 95 %CI 1.25-5.21, p = 0.01) in both arms. A 
change to undetected during treatment did not significantly predict better OS.
CONCLUSION: INTERIM findings are consistent with other recent clinical trials 
reporting that intermittent dosing does not improve efficacy of BRAF+MEK 
inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: A number of studies have reported reductions in mortality risk due 
to heat and cold over time. However, questions remain about the drivers of these 
adaptation processes to ambient temperatures. We aimed to analyse the 
demographic and socioeconomic drivers of the downward trends in vulnerability to 
heat- and cold-related mortality observed in Spain during recent decades 
(1980-2018).
METHODS: We collected data on all-cause mortality, temperature and relevant 
contextual indicators for 48 provinces in mainland Spain and the Balearic 
Islands between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2018. Fourteen contextual indicators 
were analysed representing ageing, isolation, urbanicity, heating, air 
conditioning (AC), house antiquity and ownership, education, life expectancy, 
macroeconomics, socioeconomics, and health investment. The statistical analysis 
was separately performed for the range of months mostly causing heat- 
(June-September) and cold- (October-May) related mortality. We first applied a 
quasi-Poisson generalised linear regression in combination with distributed lag 
non-linear models (DLNM) to estimate province-specific temperature-mortality 
associations for different periods, and then we fitted univariable and 
multivariable multilevel spatiotemporal meta-regression models to evaluate the 
effect modification of the contextual characteristics on heat- and cold-related 
mortality risks over time.
FINDINGS: The average annual mean temperature has risen at an average rate of 
0·36 °C per decade in Spain over 1980-2012, although the increase in temperature 
has been more pronounced in summer (0·40 °C per decade in June-September) than 
during the rest of the year (0·33 °C per decade). This warming has been 
observed, however, in parallel with a progressive reduction in the mortality 
risk associated to both hot and cold temperatures. We found independent 
associations for AC with heat-related mortality, and heating with cold-related 
mortality. AC was responsible for about 28·6% (31·5%) of the decrease in deaths 
due to heat (extreme heat) between 1989 and 1993 and 2009-2013, and heating for 
about 38·3% (50·8%) of the reductions in deaths due to cold (extreme cold) 
temperatures. Ageing (ie, proportion of population over 64 years) attenuated the 
decrease in cold-related mortality.
INTERPRETATION: AC and heating are effective societal adaptive measures to heat 
and cold temperatures. This evidence holds important implications for climate 
change health adaptation policies, and for the projections of climate change 
impacts on human health.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established 
treatment for severe aortic stenosis (AS), but despite estimates of life 
expectancy after TAVI being essential in heart team discussion, these data are 
scarce. Therefore, the current study sought to assess long-term survival and its 
trends in relation to chronological age, surgical risk, and treatment 
period.Methods and Results: We included 2,414 consecutive patients who underwent 
TAVI for severe symptomatic AS between 2008 and 2021 at 2 international centers. 
For the analysis, long-term survival was evaluated according to age, surgical 
risk, and treatment period categorized into 3 groups, respectively. The longest 
follow-up was 13.5 years. Overall survival was 67.6% at 5 years and 26.9% at 10 
years. Younger patients, lower surgical risk, and later treatment period showed 
better survival (log-rank P<0.001, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, 
age <75years, lower surgical risk, and later time period were significantly 
associated with better survival. The incidence of paravalvular leakage 
≥moderate, red blood cell transfusion, and acute kidney injury were 
independently associated with increasing risk of 5-year death.
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world registry, survival was substantial following TAVI, 
especially in younger and lower surgical-risk patients, with improving outcomes 
over time. This should be considered in heart team discussions of life-long 
management for AS patients after TAVI.

Lung transplantation is the only therapy for patients with end-stage lung 
disease. In advanced lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), life expectancy 
increases, and it is important to recognize extrapulmonary comorbidities. 
Cardiovascular involvement, including pulmonary hypertension, right-heart 
failure, and myocardial dysfunction, are manifest in the late stages of CF 
disease. Besides right-heart failure, left-heart dysfunction seems to be 
underestimated. Therefore, an optimal anesthesia and surgical management risk 
evaluation in this high-risk patient population is mandatory, especially 
concerning the perioperative use of mechanical circulatory support. The use of 
an index case of an older patient with the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis 
demonstrates the importance of early risk stratification and strategy planning 
in a multidisciplinary team approach to guarantee successful lung 
transplantation.

PURPOSE: Today, the Internet provides access to many patients' experiences, 
which is crucial in assessing the quality of healthcare services. This paper 
introduces a model for detecting cancer patients' opinions about healthcare 
services in the Persian language, both positive and negative.
METHOD: To achieve the objectives of this study, a combination of sentiment 
analysis (SA) and topic modeling approaches was employed. All pertinent comments 
made by cancer patients were collected from the patient feedback form of the 
Tehran University of Medical Science (TUMS) Cancer Institute (CI) in Iran, from 
March to October 2021. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F-measure were utilized to assess the performance of the 
proposed model.
RESULT: The experimental findings revealed that the proposed SA model achieved 
accuracies of 89.3%, 92.6%, and 90.8% in detecting patients' sentiments towards 
general services, healthcare services, and life expectancy, respectively. Based 
on the topic modeling results, the topic "Metastasis" exhibited lower sentiment 
scores compared to other topics. Additionally, cancer patients expressed 
dissatisfaction with the current appointment booking service, while topics such 
as "Good experience," "Affable staff", and "Chemotherapy" garnered higher 
sentiment scores.
CONCLUSION: The combined use of SA and topic modeling offers valuable insights 
into healthcare services. Policymakers can utilize the knowledge obtained from 
these topics and associated sentiments to enhance patient satisfaction with 
cancer institution services.

Interpreting changes in life expectancy during temporary mortality shocks.

Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA 90095.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is a pure measure of the mortality conditions faced 
by a population, unaffected by that population's age structure. The numerical 
value of life expectancy also has an intuitive interpretation, conditional on 
some assumptions, as the expected age at death of an average newborn. This 
intuitive interpretation gives life expectancy a broad appeal. Changes in life 
expectancy are also routinely used to assess mortality trends. Interpreting 
these changes is not straightforward as the assumptions underpinning the 
intuitive interpretation of life expectancy are no longer valid. This is 
particularly problematic during mortality 'shocks,' such as during wars or 
pandemics, when mortality changes may be sudden, temporary, and contrary to 
secular trends.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an alternative perspective on what changes 
in life expectancy measure that remains applicable during mortality shocks.
CONCLUSIONS: Returning to two different models that the period life table may 
represent, I show that a difference in life expectancy is typically interpreted 
from the synthetic cohort model as the difference in mean longevity between 
different birth cohorts. However, it can also be interpreted from the stationary 
population model as a measure of premature mortality in a death cohort. The 
latter, less common interpretation makes more sense for temporary declines in 
life expectancy induced by mortality shocks. The absolute change in life 
expectancy is then an age-standardized value of the average lifespan reduction 
for people dying during the mortality shock.
CONTRIBUTION: To clarify what a decline in life expectancy measures during 
mortality shocks is important, especially as demographers often assess the 
mortality impact of those shocks using this metric, which gets widely reported 
beyond demographers' inner circle.
