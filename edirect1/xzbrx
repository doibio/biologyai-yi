remained the same as in 2011. The infant mortality rate of 5.98 deaths per 1,000 
live births in 2012 was a historically low value, but it was not significantly 
different from the 2011 rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The decline of the age-adjusted death rate to a record low value 
for the United States, and the increase in life expectancy to a record high 
value of 78.8 years, are consistent with long-term trends in mortality.

Lymphoma Society, White Plains, NY.

BACKGROUND: The high prices of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) therapy are well 
recognized, but less discussion has focused on the value of health care spending 
on the disease. This study examined whether the added costs have been "worth" 
the benefits among older adults with CML.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed trends in health care costs and survival over 
time of 2164 CML patients over age 65 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and 
End Results-Medicare-linked database. We estimated life expectancy over a 
15-year duration after diagnosis using a Weibull survival model and projected 
the corresponding costs using a 2-part model, adjusting for patient 
characteristics. We estimated population-level survival, total health care 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (expressed as cost per life 
year gained) over the period of 1995-2007.
RESULTS: We found that therapeutic improvements in the treatment of CML have 
been associated with survival gains among older adults. Mean life expectancy was 
2.2 years in 1995 and increased to 4.2 years in 2007. During the same timeframe, 
CML care costs have increased, from $127,000 in 1995 to $278,000 in 2007 (2010 
dollars), mostly due to increasing tyrosine kinase inhibitor costs. The 
aggregated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $74,000/life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that, despite high costs, CML care may provide 
reasonable value for money among older patients between 1995-2007. Our study 
sheds light on the value of health care spending on CML by considering both the 
costs and the benefits. Future research should investigate strategies to improve 
treatment adherence to maximize the value of CML care.

Background and objective Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with 
long-term clinical and economic burden. Clinical guidelines generally recommend 
at least 3 months of anticoagulation, but, in clinical practice, concerns over 
bleeding risk often limit extended treatment. Apixaban was studied for extended 
VTE treatment in the AMPLIFY-EXT trial, demonstrating superiority to placebo in 
VTE reduction without increasing risk of major bleeding. This study assessed the 
long-term clinical and economic benefits of extending treatment with apixaban 
when clinical equipoise exists compared to standard of care with 
enoxaparin/warfarin and other novel oral anti-coagulants (NOACs) for the 
treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE in Canada. Methods A Markov model was 
developed to follow patients with VTE over their lifetimes. Efficacy and safety 
for apixaban and enoxaparin/warfarin were based on AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT, 
while relative efficacy to other NOACs was synthesized by network meta-analysis 
(NMA). Dosages for NOACs and enoxaparin/warfarin were based on their respective 
trials and were given up to 18 months and up to 6 months, followed by no 
treatment, respectively. Patient quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were based 
on published studies, and costs for resource utilization were from a Ministry of 
Health perspective, expressed as 2014 CAD ($). Results Extended treatment with 
apixaban compared to enoxaparin/warfarin resulted in fewer recurrent VTEs, 
VTE-related deaths, and bleeding events, but at slightly increased cost. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $4828 per QALY gained. Compared to 
other NOACs, apixaban had the fewest bleeding events, similar recurrent VTE 
events, and the lowest overall cost, which was driven by the strong bleeding 
profile. In scenario analyses of acute and lifetime treatments, apixaban was 
cost-effective against all strategies. Conclusions Extended treatment with 
apixaban can offer substantial clinical benefits and is a cost-effective 
alternative to enoxaparin/warfarin and other NOACs.

What are we measuring? A critique of range of motion methods currently in use 
for Dupuytren's disease and recommendations for practice.

BACKGROUND: Range of motion is the most frequently reported measure used in 
practice to evaluate outcomes. A goniometer is the most reliable tool to assess 
range of motion yet, the lack of consistency in reporting prevents comparison 
between studies. The aim of this study is to identify how range of motion is 
currently assessed and reported in Dupuytren's disease literature. Following 
analysis recommendations for practice will be made to enable consistency in 
future studies for comparability. This paper highlights the variation in range 
of motion reporting in Dupuytren's disease.
METHODS: A Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study design 
format was used for the search strategy and search terms. Surgery, needle 
fasciotomy or collagenase injection for primary or recurrent Dupuytren's disease 
in adults were included if outcomes were monitored using range of motion to 
record change. A literature search was performed in May 2013 using subject 
heading and free-text terms to also capture electronic publications ahead of 
print. In total 638 publications were identified and following screening 90 
articles met the inclusion criteria. Data was extracted and entered onto a 
spreadsheet for analysis. A thematic analysis was carried out to establish any 
duplication, resulting in the final range of motion measures identified.
RESULTS: Range of motion measurement lacked clarity, with goniometry reportedly 
used in only 43 of the 90 studies, 16 stated the use of a range of motion 
protocol. A total of 24 different descriptors were identified describing range 
of motion in the 90 studies. While some studies reported active range of motion, 
others reported passive or were unclear. Eight of the 24 categories were 
identified through thematic analysis as possibly describing the same measure, 
'lack of joint extension' and accounted for the most frequently used.
CONCLUSIONS: Published studies lacked clarity in reporting range of motion, 
preventing data comparison and meta-analysis. Percentage change lacks context 
and without access to raw data, does not allow direct comparison of baseline 
characteristics. A clear description of what is being measured within each study 
was required. It is recommended that range of motion measuring and reporting for 
Dupuytren's disease requires consistency to address issues that fall into 3 main 
categories: Definition of terms, Protocol statement, Outcome reporting.

Efficient Research Design: Using Value-of-Information Analysis to Estimate the 
Optimal Mix of Top-down and Bottom-up Costing Approaches in an Economic 
Evaluation alongside a Clinical Trial.

In designing economic evaluations alongside clinical trials, analysts are 
frequently faced with alternative methods of collecting the same data, the 
extremes being top-down ("gross costing") and bottom-up ("micro-costing") 
approaches. A priori, bottom-up approaches may be considered superior to 
top-down approaches but are also more expensive to collect and analyze. In this 
article, we use value-of-information analysis to estimate the efficient mix of 
observations on each method in a proposed clinical trial. By assigning a prior 
bivariate distribution to the 2 data collection processes, the predicted 
posterior (i.e., preposterior) mean and variance of the superior process can be 
calculated from proposed samples using either process. This is then used to 
calculate the preposterior mean and variance of incremental net benefit and 
hence the expected net gain of sampling. We apply this method to a previously 
collected data set to estimate the value of conducting a further trial and 
identifying the optimal mix of observations on drug costs at 2 levels: by 
individual item (process A) and by drug class (process B). We find that 
substituting a number of observations on process A for process B leads to a 
modest £ 35,000 increase in expected net gain of sampling. Drivers of the 
results are the correlation between the 2 processes and their relative cost. 
This method has potential use following a pilot study to inform efficient data 
collection approaches for a subsequent full-scale trial. It provides a formal 
quantitative approach to inform trialists whether it is efficient to collect 
resource use data on all patients in a trial or on a subset of patients only or 
to collect limited data on most and detailed data on a subset.

University , 225 E Chicago Ave , Chicago , IL , USA.

OBJECTIVE: Therapy for autoimmune hepatitis has been prednisone based for 
decades; however, budesonide may be equally effective with fewer side effects. 
Our aim was to evaluate quality-adjusted life years and health care costs of 
three different treatment regimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment using prednisone, budesonide or a combination 
of both over a three-year period in newly diagnosed children with type I 
autoimmune hepatitis were simulated with a Markov model. Transition 
probabilities were calculated over consecutive three-month period. Costs were 
determined from a hospital database and health utilities were estimated from the 
literature. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to 
simulate the outcomes of 5000 patients in each treatment arm.
RESULTS: Compared to standard therapy, budesonide leads to a gain of 0.09 
quality-adjusted life years, costing $17,722 per QALY over a three-year period. 
Standard therapy led to significantly lower QALY's compared to other strategies 
(p < 0.001). Health utilities of patients in remission in each treatment group 
had the greatest impact on the model. Budesonide remained the treatment of 
choice if the probability of inducing remission was 55% or greater.
CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide therapy in non-cirrhotic, treatment naïve patients with 
type I autoimmune hepatitis yielded greater QALY's compared to the current 
standard therapy with an acceptable increase in costs.

OBJECTIVE: To assess 90-day postoperative mortality after robot-assisted 
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) and retropubic radical prostatectomy 
(RRP) using nationwide population-based registry data.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using the National Prostate 
Cancer Register of Sweden, including 22 344 men with localized prostate cancer 
of clinical stage T1-T3, whose prostate-specific antigen levels were <50 μg/mL 
and who had undergone primary radical prostatectomy in the period 1998-2012. 
Vital status was ascertained through the Total Population Register. The rates 
for 90-day postoperative mortality were analysed using logistic regression 
analysis, and comparisons of 90-day mortality with the background population 
were made using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).
RESULTS: Of the 14 820 men who underwent RRP, 29 (0.20%) died, and of the 7 524 
men who underwent RARP, 10 (0.13%) died. Mortality in the cohort during the 
90-day postoperative period was lower than in an age-matched background 
population: SMR 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.75). There was no 
statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality according to surgical 
method: RARP vs RRP odds ratio (OR) 1.14; 95% CI 0.46-2.81. Postoperative 90-day 
mortality decreased over time: 2008-2012 vs 1998-2007 OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21-0.95, 
mainly because of lower mortality after RARP.
CONCLUSION: The 90-day postoperative mortality rates were low after RARP and RRP 
and there was no statistically significant difference between the methods. Given 
the long life expectancy among men with low- and intermediate-risk prostate 
cancer, very low postoperative mortality is a prerequisite for RP, which was 
fulfilled by both RRP and RARP. The selection of healthy men for RP is 
highlighted by the lower 90-day mortality after RP compared with the background 
population.

BACKGROUND: In Germany, the annual mortality rate from cancer in the year 2011 
was 269.9 deaths per 100 000 persons; every fourth death was due to cancer. A 
central objective of palliative care is to maintain the best possible quality of 
life for cancer patients right up to the end of their lives.
METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically 
searched for pertinent publications, and the ones that were selected were 
assessed as recommended by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. As 
part of the German Guideline Program in Oncology, recommendations for the S3 
Guideline on Palliative Care concerning seven different topics in the management 
of adult patients with incurable cancer were developed by a representative 
expert panel employing a consensus process.
RESULTS: Opioids are the drugs of first choice for severe and moderately severe 
cancer-related pain, and for breathlessness. No clinically relevant respiratory 
depression was observed in any study. When opioids are used, accompanying 
medication to prevent constipation is recommended. Drugs other than opioids are 
ineffective against breathlessness, but clinical experience has shown that 
benzodiazepines and opioids can be used in combination in advanced stages of 
disease, or if the patient suffers from marked anxiety. Depression should be 
treated even in patients with a short life expectancy; psychotherapy is 
indicated, and antidepressant medication is indicated as well if depression is 
at least moderately severe. Communication skills, an essential component of 
palliative care, play a major role in conversations between the physician and 
the patient about the diagnosis, the prognosis, and the patient's wish to hasten 
death. When the dying phase begins, tumor-specific treatments should be stopped.
CONCLUSION: Palliative care should be offered to cancer patients with incurable 
disease. Generalist and specialist palliative care constitute a central 
component of patient care, with the goal of achieving the best possible quality 
of life for the patient.

INTRODUCTION: Mechanical bowel obstruction (MBO) remains one of the most common 
abdominal surgical emergencies. The aetiology of MBO depends on the population 
demographics and period of time in which a given population was studied. We are 
presenting the results of an analysis covering 145 years of observations based 
on patients operated in our department.
METHODS: The single centre retrospective analysis included 1825 patients with 
MBO. They were divided into 4 groups depending on the years in which they were 
treated : group 1 (1868-1898), group 2 (1956-1970), group 3 (1987-1999), group 4 
(2000-2013). The analysis covered the sex distribution, the mean age of patients 
versus the life expectancy and changes in MBO aetiology in every period.
RESULTS: We noticed an increase in the mean age and the growing divergence 
between life expectancy. Additionally, an increasing percentage of women were 
observed. There were also significant changes in the aetiology. An increase in 
MBO caused by cancer was observed. The rate of strangulated hernias doubled in 
the second period of time, and then it gradually decreased. Intestinal volvulus 
was common in the first period and became one of the rarest causes of MBO in the 
subsequent periods. MBO due to adhesions remained at the same level. It became, 
however, the most common cause in the last period.
CONCLUSIONS: Within nearly 150 years significant changes occurred in the 
demographics and aetiology of MBO. Currently, the most common cause is 
peritoneal adhesions after previous surgeries. Although our results represent a 
single centre experience, they may reflect changing patterns in MBO in the 
Polish population over time.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Documentation of atrial fibrillation is required to 
initiate oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent stroke prevention. Atrial 
fibrillation often goes undetected with traditional electrocardiogram monitoring 
techniques. We evaluated whether atrial fibrillation detection using continuous 
long-term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor is cost-effective for 
preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke, in comparison 
to the standard of care.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of insertable cardiac monitors from a UK National Health 
Service perspective using data from the randomized CRYSTAL-AF trial and other 
published literature. We also conducted scenario analyses (CHADS2 score) and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses. All costs and benefits were discounted at 
3.5%.
RESULTS: Monitoring cryptogenic stroke patients with an insertable cardiac 
monitor was associated with fewer recurrent strokes and increased 
quality-adjusted life years compared to the standard of care (7.37 vs 7.22). 
Stroke-related costs were reduced in insertable cardiac monitor patients, but 
overall costs remained higher than the standard of care (£19,631 vs £17,045). 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £17,175 per quality-adjusted life 
years gained, compared to standard of care in the base-case scenario, which is 
below established quality-adjusted life years willingness-to-pay thresholds. 
When warfarin replaced non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants as the main 
anticoagulation therapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £13,296 
per quality-adjusted life years gained.
CONCLUSION: Insertable cardiac monitors are a cost-effective diagnostic tool for 
the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke. The 
cost-effectiveness results have relevance for the UK and across value-based 
healthcare systems that assess costs relative to outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies of the cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic 
valve replacement (TAVR) have been based primarily on a single 
balloon-expandable system.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
TAVR with a self-expanding prosthesis compared with surgical aortic valve 
replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis and high surgical 
risk.
METHODS: We performed a formal economic analysis on the basis of individual, 
patient-level data from the CoreValve U.S. High Risk Pivotal Trial. Empirical 
data regarding survival and quality of life over 2 years, and medical resource 
use and hospital costs through 12 months were used to project life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime medical costs in order to 
estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of TAVR versus SAVR from a U.S.
RESULTS: Relative to SAVR, TAVR reduced initial length of stay an average of 4.4 
days, decreased the need for rehabilitation services at discharge, and resulted 
in superior 1-month quality of life. Index admission and projected lifetime 
costs were higher with TAVR than with SAVR (differences $11,260 and $17,849 per 
patient, respectively), whereas TAVR was projected to provide a lifetime gain of 
0.32 quality-adjusted life-years ([QALY]; 0.41 LY) with 3% discounting. Lifetime 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $55,090 per QALY gained and $43,114 
per LY gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated that a reduction in the initial 
cost of TAVR by ∼$1,650 would lead to an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio <$50,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk clinical trial population, TAVR with a 
self-expanding prosthesis provided meaningful clinical benefits compared with 
SAVR, with incremental costs considered acceptable by current U.S.
STANDARDS: With expected modest reductions in the cost of index TAVR admissions, 
the value of TAVR compared with SAVR in this patient population would become 
high. (Safety and Efficacy Study of the Medtronic CoreValve System in the

BACKGROUND: A disease activity-guided dose optimisation strategy of adalimumab 
or etanercept (TNFi (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors)) has shown to be 
non-inferior in maintaining disease control in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) compared with usual care. However, the cost-effectiveness of this 
strategy is still unknown.
METHOD: This is a preplanned cost-effectiveness analysis of the Dose REduction 
Strategy of Subcutaneous TNF inhibitors (DRESS) study, a randomised controlled, 
open-label, non-inferiority trial performed in two Dutch rheumatology outpatient 
clinics. Patients with low disease activity using TNF inhibitors were included. 
Total healthcare costs were measured and quality adjusted life years (QALY) were 
based on EQ5D utility scores. Decremental cost-effectiveness analyses were 
performed using bootstrap analyses; incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) was 
used to express cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: 180 patients were included, and 121 were allocated to the dose 
optimisation strategy and 59 to control. The dose optimisation strategy resulted 
in a mean cost saving of -€12 280 (95 percentile -€10 502; -€14 104) per patient 
per 18 months. There is an 84% chance that the dose optimisation strategy 
results in a QALY loss with a mean QALY loss of -0.02 (-0.07 to 0.02). The 
decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was €390 493 (€5 085 184; dominant) 
of savings per QALY lost. The mean iNMB was €10 467 (€6553-€14 037). Sensitivity 
analyses using 30% and 50% lower prices for TNFi remained cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease activity-guided dose optimisation of TNFi results in 
considerable cost savings while no relevant loss of quality of life was 
observed. When the minimal QALY loss is compensated with the upper limit of what 
society is willing to pay or accept in the Netherlands, the net savings are 
still high.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to clarify the state of information 
regarding opioids for families and what kinds of experiences they had with 
opioids while the patient was followed as an outpatient and inpatient.
PARTICIPANTS: This study was part of a cross-sectional nationwide survey of 
bereaved families of patients with cancer, namely, the Japan Hospice and 
Palliative Care Evaluation 2 study. The participants in this study comprised 572 
bereaved families who had experienced the death of a family member during the 
period from January 2008 to December 2009 at 1 of 103 certificated palliative 
care units.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In response to the question of "how much improvement was 
needed for information regarding opioids," 41% answered "improvement is not 
necessary at all," 43% answered "improvement is slightly necessary," 14% 
answered "improvement is necessary," and 2% answered "improvement is extremely 
necessary." Regarding anxiety about the use of opioid, it was found that 14% of 
respondents indicated "opioids are very safe," 65% of respondents indicated 
"opioids are relatively safe," 19% of respondents indicated "opioids are not so 
safe," and 2% of respondents indicated "opioids are not so safe at all." from 
the information obtained for opioids. It was found that 90% of families agreed 
with the item, "I would like to be clearly explained that drugs for medical 
purposes are safe and that the patient will not develop a drug addiction and 
their life expectancy will not be reduced."
CONCLUSION: From this study, it is important for families of patients with 
cancer to be explained profound and careful information of opioid.

Antigen binding to the B-cell receptor (BCR) induces several responses, 
resulting in B-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. However, it 
has been difficult to study these responses due to their dynamic, fast, and 
transient nature. Here, we attempted to solve this problem by developing a 
controllable trigger point for BCR and antigen recognition through the 
construction of a photoactivatable antigen, caged 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl 
(caged-NP). This photoactivatable antigen system in combination with live cell 
and single molecule imaging techniques enabled us to illuminate the previously 
unidentified B-cell probing termination behaviors and the precise BCR sorting 
mechanisms during B-cell activation. B cells in contact with caged-NP exhibited 
probing behaviors as defined by the unceasing extension of membrane pseudopods 
in random directions. Further analyses showed that such probing behaviors are 
cell intrinsic with strict dependence on F-actin remodeling but not on tonic BCR 
signaling. B-cell probing behaviors were terminated within 4 s after 
photoactivation, suggesting that this response was sensitive and specific to BCR 
engagement. The termination of B-cell probing was concomitant with the 
accumulation response of the BCRs into the BCR microclusters. We also determined 
the Brownian diffusion coefficient of BCRs from the same B cells before and 
after BCR engagement. The analysis of temporally segregated single molecule 
images of both BCR and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) 
demonstrated that antigen binding induced trapping of BCRs into the BCR 
microclusters is a fundamental mechanism for B cells to acquire antigens.

Comorbidities and male infertility: a worrisome picture.

of Urology, URI-Urological Research Institute, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, 
Milan, Italy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to analyze the current 
literature concerning health status in the setting of male infertility, taking 
into account the potential contribution of each comorbidity.
RECENT FINDINGS: Latest findings, almost unanimously confirmed how infertile 
patients usually display a quite precarious health, because of the collection of 
coexistent diseases observed in these men. More precisely, relevant 
comorbidities might influence not only man's fertility but his life expectancy 
as well. Moreover, because of the increasing trend in delaying fatherhood 
observed in Western countries over time, age might somehow act as a possible 
detrimental factor. Overall, what emerges from these studies is a complex and 
worrisome scenario.
SUMMARY: General health status in the male reproductive setting is gaining 
increasing clinical attention and relevance. Infertile men appear to be rather 
unhealthy young men as compared with fertile ones. Therefore, uroandrologists 
are challenged with the compelling task of assessing the infertile man 
considering both his general and his reproductive health, since relevant 
comorbid conditions may influence not only his life expectancy, but his 
fertility as well.

A Defining Moment in a Life-Long Journey with Dialysis.

Weintraub J(1).

Author information:
(1)Los Angeles, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: The author seeks to address the issue of lack of communication 
between the physician and the patients as one of the possibilities for continued 
poor outcomes despite technical advances in dialysis. The failure to relate to 
patients as 'people' leads to a failure to individualize treatment and deal with 
atypical problems presented by some patients, which, in turn, leads to less than 
optimal outcomes.
SUMMARY: Statistical statements of life expectancy for dialysis patients are 
misleading. While accurate in a vacuum, they are less accurate when applied to 
individuals. Life expectancy can be improved by better communication and 
education, which may lead, in turn, to positive attitudes and motivation. Though 
often overlooked, these factors are instrumental in achieving optimal results. 
The author draws on her personal experience of 40 years using all modalities of 
dialysis. Through abundant experience from decades of interactions with 
practitioners and healthcare professionals, she states her views on how dialysis 
need not be spirit- and life-defeating.
KEY MESSAGE: While long-term global results are yet to be quantified, the 
author's 40 years of dialysis and a productive, happy life, speaks for itself. 
Dialysis is not the end of life; it is only a condition to be dealt with.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on 
population-wide adult life expectancy.
STUDY DESIGN: A population-based open cohort study with repeated HIV status 
measurements and registration of vital events in Southwestern Uganda 
(1991-2012).
METHODS: Nonparametric survival analysis techniques are used for estimating 
trends in the adult life expectancy of the general population (aged 15 and 
above), the adult life expectancy by HIV status, and the adult life expectancy 
deficit. The life expectancy deficit is estimated as the difference between 
overall life expectancy and life expectancy of the HIV-negative population. All 
estimates are disaggregated by sex.
RESULTS: Between 1991-1993 and 2009-2012, population-wide adult life expectancy 
increased from 39.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-42.8] to 56.1 years (95% 
CI: 54.0-58.5) in women, and from 38.6 (95% CI: 35.4-42.1) to 51.4 years (95% 
CI: 49.2-53.7) in men. Most of the adult life expectancy gains coincide with the 
introduction of ART in 2004; as evidenced by an increase in the adult life 
expectancy of people living with HIV between 2000-2002 and 2009-2012 of 22.9 and 
20.0 years for women and men, respectively. Over the whole period of 
observation, the adult life expectancy deficit associated with HIV decreased 
from 16.1 (95% CI: 12.7-19.8) to 6.0 years (95% CI: 4.1-7.8) among women, and 
from 16.0 (95% CI: 12.1-19.9) to 2.8 years (95% CI: 1.2-4.6) among men.
CONCLUSION: Population-wide life expectancy increased substantially, largely 
driven by reductions in HIV-related mortality. Women have gained more adult life 
years than men since the introduction of ART, but the burden of HIV in terms of 
the life years lost is still larger for women than it is for men.

This analysis of the French health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. The French population has a good level of 
health, with the second highest life expectancy in the world for women. It has a 
high level of choice of providers, and a high level of satisfaction with the 
health system. However, unhealthy habits such as smoking and harmful alcohol 
consumption remain significant causes of avoidable mortality. Combined with the 
significant burden of chronic diseases, this has underscored the need for 
prevention and integration of services, although these have not historically 
been strengths of the French system. Although the French health care system is a 
social insurance system, it has historically had a stronger role for the state 
than other Bismarckian social insurance systems. Public financing of health care 
expenditure is among the highest in Europe and out-of-pocket spending among the 
lowest. Public insurance is compulsory and covers the resident population; it is 
financed by employee and employer contributions as well as increasingly through 
taxation. Complementary insurance plays a significant role in ensuring equity in 
access. Provision is mixed; providers of outpatient care are largely private, 
and hospital beds are predominantly public or private non-profit-making. Despite 
health outcomes being among the best in the European Union, social and 
geographical health inequities remain. Inequality in the distribution of health 
care professionals is a considerable barrier to equity. The rising cost of 
health care and the increasing demand for long-term care are also of concern. 
Reforms are ongoing to address these issues, while striving for equity in 
financial access; a long-term care reform including public coverage of long-term 
care is still pending.

This analysis of the Swiss health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. The Swiss health system is highly 
complex, combining aspects of managed competition and corporatism (the 
integration of interest groups in the policy process) in a decentralized 
regulatory framework shaped by the influences of direct democracy. The health 
system performs very well with regard to a broad range of indicators. Life 
expectancy in Switzerland (82.8 years) is the highest in Europe after Iceland, 
and healthy life expectancy is several years above the European Union (EU) 
average. Coverage is ensured through mandatory health insurance (MHI), with 
subsidies for people on low incomes. The system offers a high degree of choice 
and direct access to all levels of care with virtually no waiting times, though 
managed care type insurance plans that include gatekeeping restrictions are 
becoming increasingly important. Public satisfaction with the system is high and 
quality is generally viewed to be good or very good. Reforms since the year 2000 
have improved the MHI system, changed the financing of hospitals, strengthened 
regulations in the area of pharmaceuticals and the control of epidemics, and 
harmonized regulation of human resources across the country. In addition, there 
has been a slow (and not always linear) process towards more centralization of 
national health policy-making. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain. The 
costs of the health care system are well above the EU average, in particular in 
absolute terms but also as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) (11.5%). 
MHI premiums have increased more quickly than incomes since 2003. By European 
standards, the share of out-of-pocket payments is exceptionally high at 26% of 
total health expenditure (compared to the EU average of 16%). Low and 
middle-income households contribute a greater share of their income to the 
financing of the health system than higher-income households. Flawed financial 
incentives exist at different levels of the health system, potentially 
distorting the allocation of resources to different providers. Furthermore, the 
system remains highly fragmented as regards both organization and planning as 
well as health care provision.

The long and remarkable life of Janet Taylor Spence, the sixth woman to serve as 
president of the American Psychological Association (APA), ended on March 16, 
2015, after a short illness. Janet's 1978 book, Masculinity & Femininity, 
coauthored with Robert Helmreich, was a major contribution to our understanding 
of the complex relationships between personal attributes, self-esteem, and 
attitudes toward women, as well their links to both achievement motivation and 
parental characteristics. Janet's interest in achievement motivation was an 
extension of her gender work, as she attempted to learn more about the ways in 
which presumed differences in achievement motivation might be related to the key 
dimensions of instrumentality and expressiveness. Janet's election to the 
presidency of the APA was the culmination of a long and broad involvement in the 
organization. She served on the Board of Directors from 1976 to 1978, and again 
in 1983 to 1984 during her presidential term. Earlier she served on the Board of 
Scientific Affairs and edited Contemporary Psychology in the 1970s. Janet was a 
fellow in four divisions (3, 8, 12, and 35), and in 2004 she received the APA 
Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology.

Older women experience a large share of breast cancer incidence and death. With 
the projected rise in the number of older cancer patients, adjuvant chemo-, 
radiation and endocrine therapy management will become a key component of breast 
cancer treatment in older women. Many factors influence adjuvant treatment 
decisions including patient preferences, life expectancy and tumor biology. 
Geriatric assessment predicts important outcomes, identifies key deficits, and 
can aid in the decision making process. This review utilizes clinical vignettes 
to illustrate core principles in adjuvant management of breast cancer in older 
women and suggests an approach incorporating life expectancy and geriatric 
assessment.
