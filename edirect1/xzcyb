subjective judgement to modify effectiveness parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessment may be good value for money. However, limited 
availability of geriatric consultation services, may hinder implementation. 
Thus, the estimated benefits of frailty screening may not be achievable in 
practice.

Co-infection with multiple pathogens, especially the spread of Giardia and 
Cryptosporidium in source water among those with immunodeficiency, is common 
worldwide, which will result in an increase in overall risk. In this study, the 
quantitative microbial risk assessment model was used to estimate the cumulative 
risk of co-infection with Giardia and Cryptosporidium promoted by HIV, 
considering age sensitivity. The sensitivity of population segments with 
different ages was estimated by the optimization method, based on clinical data 
of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis with age structure. The factors of 
co-infection enhancement were used to quantify HIV synergism with the action of 
other pathogens. The removal rates of Giardia and Cryptosporidium through water 
treatment were estimated by a model involving turbidity and particles. The 
results showed that children (0-4 years) were 17.911-fold more sensitive to 
infection with Giardia than adults (15-64 years), and that with Cryptosporidium 
was 10.592-fold. Removal rates of these parasites in water treatment plants in 
major cities in China were estimated to be 2.03 log10. Considering the 
HIV-synergistic and age-susceptibility effects, the cumulative risk of exposure 
to Giardia or Cryptosporidium was about 38.781 × 10-6DALYs (Disability-adjusted 
life years) per person per year, which was much higher than the reference risk 
level recommended by the World Health Organization (10-6DALYs). The methodology 
and results of this study will be useful in better evaluating and reducing the 
burden due to infection of Giardia and/or Cryptosporidium in China and other 
countries.

OBJECTIVE: An updated version of the SF-6D Classification System (SF-6Dv2) has 
been developed, and utility value sets are required. The aim of this study was 
to test the development of a United Kingdom SF-6Dv2 value set, and address 
limitations of the existing SF-6D value set (which results in a narrow range of 
utilities). This was done using 2 discrete-choice experiment (DCE) tasks. 
Interactions and preference heterogeneity were also investigated.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: An online sample of respondents (n=3014) completed 
10 DCE with duration choice sets from an efficient design of 300 (Design 1) and 
2 DCE with duration choice sets including immediate death from a set of 60 
(Design 2). Conditional logit regression was used to estimate value set models 
with and without interactions. We investigated preference heterogeneity using 
latent class models.
RESULTS: Models including ordered coefficients within each dimension were 
developed, with the favored model including an additional interaction term when 
one dimension was at the most severe level. Value sets differed across Designs 1 
and 2. Design 1 models had a wider utility range and a higher proportion of 
negative values. The most important dimensions were pain, mental health, and 
physical functioning. Preference heterogeneity was apparent, with a 2-class 
model describing the data.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and applied a protocol to value the SF-6Dv2 using DCE. 
The results provide a provisional value set for use in resource allocation. The 
protocol can be applied internationally. Further work should investigate how to 
account for preference heterogeneity in value set production.

Caregiver Strain and Heart Failure Patient Clinical Event Risk: An Extension of 
Previous Work.

Bidwell JT, Lee CS, Higgins MK, Reilly CM, Clark PC, Dunbar SB.

BACKGROUND: In a study of Italian heart failure patient-caregiver dyads, greater 
caregiver strain significantly predicted lower patient clinical event risk.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this secondary analysis was to examine this 
relationship in a sample from the United States.
METHODS: Data came from 92 dyads who participated in a self-care intervention. 
Logistic regression was used to test the relationship between baseline strain 
(Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale, divided into tertiles) and patient likelihood 
of events (heart failure hospitalization/emergency visit or all-cause mortality) 
over 8 months.
RESULTS: Nearly half of patients (n = 40, 43.5%) had an event. High (vs low) 
caregiver strain was associated with a 92.7% event-risk reduction, but with 
substantial variability around the effect (odds ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence 
interval, 0.01-0.63; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Although findings were similar to the Italian study, the high 
degree of variability and contrasting findings to other studies signal a level 
of complexity that warrants further investigation.

Little is known about the potential population-level impact of HIV pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) use among cisgender male sex workers (MSWs), a high-risk 
subset of cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM). Using an agent-based model, 
we simulated HIV transmission among cisgender MSM in Rhode Island to determine 
the impacts of PrEP implementation where cisgender MSWs were equally ("standard 
expansion") or five times as likely ("focused expansion") to initiate PrEP 
compared to other cisgender MSM. Without PrEP, the model predicted 920 new HIV 
infections over a decade, or an average incidence of 0.39 per 100 person-years. 
In a focused expansion scenario where 15% of at-risk cisgender MSM used PrEP, 
the total number of new HIV infections was reduced by 58.1% at a cost of $57,180 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Focused expansion of PrEP use 
among cisgender MSWs may be an efficient and cost-effective strategy for 
reducing HIV incidence in the broader population of cisgender MSM.

INTRODUCTION: Distal radius fractures (DRF) are the most common fractures of the 
upper extremities and incidence is expected to continue rising as life 
expectancy increases. Palmar locking plate stabilizing has since become the 
standard treatment for dorsally displaced DRF. Main aim of this study was to 
investigate correlation between radiological and clinical outcome in patients 
stabilized by palmar locking plate with a minimum follow-up of one year.
METHODS: A total of 524 patients with DRF, stabilized using palmar angular 
stable locking plate fixation were included in the study. Of these, 117 patients 
had to be excluded and another 177 were not accessible. The study group thus 
compromised 230 patients who returned for the follow-up investigation and were 
followed-up clinically and radiologically with a mean follow-up interval of 
20 months. Outcome was evaluated using pain, range of motion (ROM) and grip 
strength parameters. In addition, self-assessment by patients was registered on 
the QuickDASH, PRWE and Mayo Score. The immediate postoperative and final 
checkup radiographs were scrutinized for alignment and intra-articular step-off.
RESULTS: Bivariant correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between 
ulnar variance and QuickDASH (r = 0.18, p = 0.01), grip strength (r = - 0.18, 
p = 0.04) and Mayo Score (r = - 0.23, p = 0.001). No significant differences 
could be found between an unacceptable (> 2 mm) and acceptable (< 2 mm) ulnar 
variance in respect of pain, ROM, grip strength and patient-reported outcome 
measurements. Age, gender, additional fracture to the ulnar styloid, or type of 
postoperative immobilization showed no significant or clinical important impact 
on the final patient-reported outcome. No significant differences in incidence 
of complications, ROM or loss of reduction could be found in any patients over 
or under 65 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization of DRF by palmar angular stable locking plate is a 
safe form of treatment and results in a good clinical and radiological outcome 
with low complication rate. Ulnar variance showed a significant correlation to 
grip strength, QuickDASH and Mayo Score, but an unacceptable ulnar variance 
(> 2 mm) was not associated with a worse clinical important outcome. Age 
(< 65/> 65 years), gender and type of immobilization had no impact on the 
complication rate or in the final functional or radiological outcome.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental contaminants produced 
during incomplete combustion of organic matter. Humans can be exposed to them 
via several pathways (inhalation, digestion, dermal exposure). The aim of this 
study was to assess the concentration of 11 monohydroxylated metabolites of PAHs 
(OH-PAHs) in 660 urine samples collected from mothers and their newborns 
residing in two localities of the Czech Republic - Most and Ceske Budejovice - 
in 2016 and 2017. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the target analytes were extracted 
from the urine samples using liquid-liquid extraction, with extraction solvent 
ethyl acetate and a clean-up step using dispersive solid-phase extraction 
(d-SPE) with the Z-Sep sorbent. For identification and quantification, 
ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry was applied. 2-OH-NAP was the compound present in all of the 
measured samples and it was also the compound at the highest concentration in 
both mothers' and newborns' urine samples (median concentration 5.15 μg/g 
creatinine and 3.58 μg/g creatinine). The total concentrations of OH-PAHs in 
urine samples collected from mothers were 2 times higher compared to their 
children. The most contaminated samples were collected in Most in the period 
October 2016-March 2017 from both mothers (12.59 μg/g creatinine) and their 
newborns (8.29 μg/g creatinine). The concentrations of OH-PAHs in urine samples, 
which were collected from both mothers and their newborns as presented in this 
study, are comparable with those found in our previous study between 2013 and 
2014. In addition, they are slightly lower or comparable to other studies from 
Poland, USA, Germany, China, and Australia. The results might indicate that the 
population in the previously highly air-polluted mining districts carries some 
long-term changes (maybe existing changes in genetic information), which also 
affect the metabolism of PAHs. It could be related to the long-lasting effect, 
and thus corresponding to the shortened life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is used to prevent 
complications after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, although 
some results are controversial and basal ventricular function may play a role. 
This study assessed the benefit of preoperative use of IABP, as stratified by 
the ventricular function, in a population submitted to high-surgical-risk CABG.
METHODS: Patients >18 years old, with multiple coronary artery disease and thus 
candidates for CABG, were included. Cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI), acute ventricle mechanical dysfunction, severe aortic 
regurgitation, tachyarrhythmia, massive pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, or low 
life expectancy were exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients aged 65 years old with 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and mean left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) 46% constituted the study population. No difference was 
observed at 30-day mortality endpoint (IABP vs. no IABP, 17 vs. 24%, OR 0.63, p 
= 0.20; AMI 25 vs. 31%, OR 0.75, p = 0.29). After LVEF stratification, the 
subgroup of 48 (75%) patients under IABP support and LVEF >35% had a reduced 
30-day mortality risk (LVEF ≤35% vs. LVEF >35%, 37.5 vs. 10.4%, OR 0.3, p = 
0.03), independently from potential confounders and showing an interaction with 
European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation-II (EuroSCORE-II). At 
secondary endpoints, IABP use was associated with a lower prevalence of acute 
renal failure and renal replacement therapy, but with a longer stay in the 
intensive care unit and longer hospitalization time.
CONCLUSION: The preoperative use of IABP was associated with an independent 
reduction of 30-day mortality risk in cases with LVEF >35% in a population 
submitted to high-surgical-risk CABG. Likewise, the use of IABP was associated 
with a lower risk of postoperative renal complications.

BACKGROUND: Dual pathway inhibition with 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice daily plus 
100 mg aspirin once daily may be a promising alternative to 100 mg aspirin 
antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients 
with coronary artery disease and/or peripheral arterial disease. However, 
treatment costs and bleeding risks are higher, and there is another treatment 
option for peripheral arterial disease, 75 mg clopidogrel. A comprehensive 
assessment of benefits, risks and costs of dual pathway inhibition versus 
standard of care is needed.
METHODS: We used a state transition model including cardiovascular, ischaemic 
limb and bleeding events to compare dual pathway inhibition to aspirin 
antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease, and additionally to clopidogrel 
antiplatelet therapy in peripheral arterial disease patients. We calculated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
of lifelong treatment, and the cost-effectiveness probability at a 
€50,000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold.
RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life-years and costs of dual pathway inhibition were 
highest, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios versus aspirin were €32,109 
in coronary artery disease and €26,381 in peripheral arterial disease patients, 
with 92% and 56% cost-effectiveness probability, respectively (clopidogrel was 
extendedly dominated). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below €20,000 
in comorbid peripheral arterial disease patients and coronary artery disease 
patients younger than 65 years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were above 
€50,000 in carotid artery disease patients and coronary artery disease patients 
older than 75 years.
CONCLUSION: Lifelong preventive treatment of coronary artery disease and 
peripheral arterial disease patients at risk of cardiovascular events with dual 
pathway inhibition improves health outcomes and seems overall cost-effective 
relative to aspirin antiplatelet therapy and also to clopidogrel antiplatelet 
therapy for peripheral arterial disease, particularly in comorbid patients, but 
not in older patients and in carotid artery disease patients. These findings may 
warrant a targeted approach.

OBJECTIVE: To better understand the humanistic and economic burden of focal 
seizures in children 2-12 years old.
METHODS: We conducted a targeted literature review by searching MEDLINE for 
English-language publications reporting on children 2-12 years old with focal 
seizures published in the United States since 2008.
RESULTS: Thirty-five publications were included. Incidence of focal seizures was 
23.2 to 47.1 per 100,000 children per year; prevalence was 2.0 per 1,000 
children, and ranged from 1.6 - 2.6 per 1,000 in patients of any age. Life 
expectancy was 47.3-61.8 years among children 3-12 years old. Patients took 
several antiepileptic drugs and experienced frequent seizures, sleep disorders, 
mood disorders, migraine, and seizure-related injuries (eg, bone fractures, 
sprains, open wounds). Children with focal seizures scored below average on 
cognitive assessments and up to 42%, 16%, and 19% had depression, anxiety, and 
attention-deficit disorder, respectively. Patients of any age had about 10 
outpatient visits (2 epilepsy-related), 2 inpatient visits (less than 1 
epilepsy-related), and 24 procedures (1 epilepsy-related) per year. Medication 
adherence was low: only half of pediatric patients maintained ≥90% adherence 
over 6 months. Annual total health care costs among patients of any age ranged 
from $18,369 - 38,549; first-year total health care costs for children were 
$19,883.
CONCLUSIONS: Incidence and prevalence of focal seizures is high and the 
humanistic and economic burdens are significant. Future studies focused 
exclusively on children with focal seizures are needed to more precisely 
describe the burden. We also suggest further research and implementation of 
methods to improve medication adherence as an approach to lessen burden on these 
young patients.

BACKGROUND: Although precision medicine using genetic information offers 
significant promise, its uptake and eventual clinical and economic impacts are 
uncertain. Health care payers will play an important role in evaluating evidence 
and costs to develop coverage and reimbursement policies.
OBJECTIVE: To elicit U.S. health care payer preference for genomic precision 
medicine to better understand trade-offs among clinical benefits, uncertainty, 
and cost.
METHODS: Using key informant interviewer discussions (N = 6 payers), we 
identified 6 key attributes of genetic tests important to payers: type of 
information the test provides (screening vs. treatment prediction), probability 
that the member has an informative genetic marker, expert agreement on changing 
medical care based on the marker, quality-of-life gains, life expectancy gains 
(with statistical uncertainty), and cost to the plan. We designed a stated 
preference discrete choice experiment using these attributes and administered a 
web survey to a sample of U.S. health care payers. We used effects coding and 
analyzed the data using an error component mixed logit modeling approach.
RESULTS: The survey response rate was 58% (150 participants completed the 
survey). Approximately 53% of respondents had previous experience evaluating 
genetic tests for reimbursement, and 85% had more than 5 years of health care 
decision-making experience. Payers valued improvements in quality of life the 
most (marginal willingness to pay [mWTP] of $1,513-$6,076), followed by medical 
expert agreement on the treatment change (mWTP of $2,881-$3,489). Payers placed 
a relatively lower value for genetic tests with lower marker probability (mWTP 
of $2,776 for highest marker probability to $423 for lowest marker probability). 
Payers mWTP was lowest for resolving uncertainty in quality of life (mWTP of 
$1,513-$2,031) and life expectancy gains ($536-$1,537).
CONCLUSIONS: Payers exhibited a strong preference for genetic tests that 
improved quality of life, had high expert agreement on changing medical care, 
and increased life expectancy. These findings suggest that payers will need 
evidence of clinical utility to support coverage and reimbursement of genomic 
precision medicine.

INTRODUCTION Life expectancy in patients with schizophrenia is 15-20 years less 
than the general population. A dominant cause of morbidity and mortality in 
these patients is cardiovascular disease. Adverse consequences of modifiable 
cardiovascular risk factors can be reduced by regular monitoring of metabolic 
outcomes and intervention if required. AIM To evaluate the metabolic screening 
in primary care for patients with schizoaffective disorders managed in primary 
care. To show the usefulness of combining simple practice audits in evaluating 
such areas of clinical practice. METHODS An audit was undertaken in eight 
general practices in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions of New Zealand. 
Specifically, the monitoring of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder whose antipsychotic medication was prescribed by primary care doctors 
was audited. Patient monitoring was compared to the guideline recommendation of 
the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) and the 
Best Practice Advisory Centre (BPAC). RESULTS In total, 117 patients were 
included in the audit and none were fully monitored, as recommended by the 
RANZCP guidelines. Although two-thirds of patients had been evaluated for 
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), lipids, blood pressure, complete blood count 
and weight, <10% of patients had had prolactin, waist circumference or 
electrocardiogram measurements recorded. The proportion of patients having a 
HbA1c measured was also significantly higher in younger patients and patients 
who were non-Māori or enrolled with an urban practice (all P<0.05). When using 
the simplified BPAC guidelines, half of all patients were correctly monitored. 
DISCUSSION These findings show there is room for improvement in the monitoring 
of patients receiving antipsychotic medication in primary care. This may 
indicate the need for clear guidance and general practitioner education around 
the monitoring requirements of these patients. Alternatively, a more simplified 
monitoring protocol may need to be developed. This audit has also shown that 
there is value in several practices completing the same audit and providing a 
larger cohort of patients for pooled data analysis.

BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs are being used 
increasingly in microvascular breast reconstruction. However, it is unclear as 
to what extent the benefits outweigh the costs. We hypothesized that an ERAS 
pathway for microvascular breast reconstruction would be cost-effective relative 
to the standard of care.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was made incorporating clinically 
relevant health states after microvascular breast reconstruction with ERAS vs 
standard of care. Probabilities and utility scores were abstracted from 
published sources, and a third-party payer perspective was adopted. Time-driven 
activity-based costing was used to map and estimate costs attributed to ERAS. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The results of 5 studies, totaling 986 patients, were pooled to 
generate health state probabilities. ERAS was found to be dominant, being both 
less expensive and more effective than standard of care. On sensitivity 
analysis, ERAS becomes cost-ineffective (incremental cost-utility ratio > 
$50,000/quality-adjusted life year) at an amount > $19,336.75. Length of stay 
would have to be reduced from 5.96 days to 3.36 days for standard of care to 
become cost-effective. Monte-Carlo analysis demonstrated ERAS to be the more 
cost-effective option across a range of willingness-to-pay values.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased medication and personnel costs attributed to 
ERAS, it is less costly overall and associated with superior outcomes compared 
with standard of care. These findings lend additional support to the value of 
ERAS implementation in microvascular breast reconstruction. Time-driven 
activity-based costing provides granular estimates and are useful in 
quality-improvement initiatives.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand emerging roles of parents 
of hospitalized children with life threatening conditions and to explore how 
complementary therapies integrated into conventional pediatric care may shift 
and/or support these roles.
DESIGN: This study is part of a larger research study that examined the 
introduction of a pediatric integrative medicine service at an acute care 
children's hospital in Canada. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted 
using one-on-one telephone interviews with a sample of parents of children 
included in the larger study. Children had access to complementary therapies 
including Reiki, massage therapy, and acupuncture.
RESULTS: A total of 36 interviews were conducted between May 2014 and January 
2016. This study found that parents of hospitalized children assume complex 
roles including that of caregiver, expert and patient (due to high levels of 
stress and anxiety). Moreover, the study reveals that the integration of 
complementary therapies with conventional care supports these parental roles.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that complementary therapies, introduced as a 
part of integrated approach to pediatric hospital care, and aimed primarily at 
managing distressing symptoms in patients, had simultaneously a positive 
contribution in providing parents with the means to navigate the complexities of 
parenting in the pediatric oncology and cardiology hospital wards and addressing 
some of their own needs.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survival has improved in Western Australia (WA) over recent 
decades. Loss of life expectancy (LOLE) is a useful measure for assessing cancer 
survival at a population-level. Some previous studies estimating LOLE have 
required a minimum follow-up beyond diagnosis to reduce the impact of modelled 
extrapolation, while others have not. The first aim of this study was to assess 
the impact of minimum length of follow-up on LOLE estimates for people diagnosed 
in 2006 with female breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, cervical, combined 
oesophageal and stomach cancers, and melanoma. Based on these results, the 
second aim was to assess temporal changes in LOLE for these cancer types for 
diagnoses between 1982 and 2016.
METHODS: Person-level linked cancer registry and mortality data were used for 
invasive primary cancer diagnoses for WA residents aged 15-89 years. The 
analysis for aim one included cases diagnosed from 1982 to the end of 2006, 
followed to the end of 2006 (i.e. no minimum follow-up), 2011 (i.e. five years 
minimum follow-up, assuming survival) or 2016 (i.e. 10 years minimum follow-up). 
To achieve the second study aim, the diagnostic period was extended to the end 
of 2016. Life expectancy estimates were obtained after fitting flexible 
parametric relative survival models. Single-year age and sex-specific death 
rates were used as a reference to estimate LOLE and proportionate loss of life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Temporal changes were not reported for prostate, cervical, oesophageal 
and stomach cancers or melanoma, due to differences in LOLE estimates by minimum 
follow-up time, or estimate imprecision. Marked reductions in LOLE were observed 
for female breast and colorectal cancer. There was minimal absolute reduction 
for lung cancer, where LOLE remained high.
CONCLUSION: This study considered the appropriateness of including recent cancer 
diagnoses when assessing temporal changes in LOLE, finding variation in 
estimates with differing minimum follow-up or high parameter uncertainty for 
most included cancer types. Temporal changes in LOLE in-turn reflected changes 
in the life expectancy of the general population, cancer detection and 
management. These factors must be considered when estimating and interpreting 
LOLE estimates.

BACKGROUND: Japan and South Korea represent "outliers" among rich nations with 
regard to having achieved high life expectancy but also ranking near the bottom 
on United Nations indices of gender equality. In the present study, we compared 
gender inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) across the life course captured 
in nationally representative surveys from South Korea and Japan. Our comparative 
analysis focused on the following questions, (1) Do Japan and South Korea 
exhibit similar patterns of gender inequalities in health as found in western 
settings (e.g. the "gender paradox" whereby women enjoy longer life expectancy, 
but worseself-rated health compared to men)? (2) Can gender differences in 
educational attainment and income account for gender differences in health in 
Japan & Korea? (3) Do gender inequalities in self-rated health differ over the 
life-course in Japan compared to South Korea?
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were drawn from nationally representative surveys 
in South Korea and Japan. We analyzed data for 239,076 participants aged 20 
years or older (226,105 in South Korea and 12,971 in Japan). We evaluated the 
gender gap in poor SRH between two countries using logistic regression models 
controlling for covariates sequentially.
RESULTS: (1) The absolute female/male gap in prevalence of poor SRH was much 
narrower in Japan compared to South Korea; (2) the prevalence ratios of poor SRH 
(women relative to men) were significantly higher in South Korea than in Japan 
after retirement age; (3) but the difference in the prevalence ratios of poor 
SRH by gender between two countries largely disappeared after adjusting for 
educational attainment & comorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Each country needs to analyze their specific situations to 
understand what determines their population health status. In addition, there 
must exist other reasons for the"gender paradox" - i.e. why Japan & Korea have 
managed to achieve high longevity without gender equality.

Effective antiretroviral therapy has extended life expectancy for individuals 
with HIV. Estimates from 2015 indicate that 47% of persons with HIV in the US 
were older than 50 years of age and 16% were older than 65 years. These older 
patients are at increased risk of age-related diseases and conditions. Further, 
there is substantial evidence that patients with HIV infection accumulate 
age-related conditions earlier than do those in the general population. There is 
risk for increased comorbidities and polypharmacy in the aging HIV-infected 
population. Specific measures for assessing and reducing the risk of 
cardiovascular disease and other age-related conditions in the aging HIV 
population are needed. This article summarizes a presentation by Judith A. 
Aberg, MD, at the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) annual 
continuing education program held in Chicago, Illinois, in May 2019.

SUMMARYThe explosion of vaccines during the 20th century allowed the control of 
numerous infectious plagues but multiple challenges oppose conservation and 
extension of these successes. The hesitation of modern societies in front of 
vaccinations requires researches in life, human and social sciences in order to 
reach a better understanding of vaccines mechanism of action and to improve the 
tolerance and acceptability of vaccines and additives. The ageing of the 
populations and the increase of subjects at risk also require to improve the 
immunogenicity and the efficiency of existing vaccines. The constant emergence 
of new epidemics or the development of the antibio-resistance imposes innovation 
and development of new vaccines. The recent difficulties faced by the 
development of vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis or AIDS illustrate the 
necessity of moving beyond classical recipes and of elaborating new vectors and 
new adjuvants, of better understanding the heterogeneity of vaccine immunity and 
of developing alternative routes of immunization. Multidisciplinary researches 
using the most recent advances in molecular, structural and cellular biology, in 
microbiology, immunology and of genetic engineering to answer these worldwide 
challenges.

RÉSUMÉ L’explosion des vaccins pendant le XXe siècle a permis le contrôle de 
nombreux fléaux infectieux mais de multiples défis s’opposent à la préservation 
et l’extension de ces succès. L’hésitation des sociétés modernes face aux 
vaccinations nécessite, outre une meilleure compréhension par des recherches en 
sciences humaines et sociales, l’amélioration de l’acceptabilité et de la 
tolérance des vaccins et adjuvants. Le vieillissement des populations et 
l’augmentation des sujets à risque nécessitent d’améliorer l’immunogénicité et 
l’efficacité des vaccins existants. L’émergence constante de nouvelles 
épidémies, le développement de l’antibio-résistance imposent la création de 
nouveaux vaccins mais les difficultés du développement de vaccins contre le 
paludisme, la tuberculose ou le sida, illustrent la nécessité de dépasser les 
approches classiques pour élaborer de nouveaux vecteurs et adjuvants vaccinaux, 
mieux comprendre l’immunité vaccinale et des populations, définir des corrélats 
de protection et développer des voies nouvelles d’immunisation. Des recherches 
multidisciplinaires utilisant les progrès les plus récents de la biologie 
structurale et cellulaire, de la microbiologie, de l’immunologie et du génie 
biomoléculaire s’imposent pour répondre à ces défis.

Rationale: Bone is the most frequent site for breast cancer metastasis, which 
accounts for the leading cause of death in advanced breast cancer patients. 
Serious skeletal-related events (SREs) caused by bone metastasis have a decisive 
impact on the life expectancy of breast cancer patients, making breast cancer 
almost incurable. Metastatic breast cancer cell induced pathological 
osteoclastogenesis is a key driver of bone metastasis and osteolytic bone 
lesions. We previously reported that gold clusters can prevent inflammation 
induced osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis in vivo. In this study, we 
investigated the effects of a BSA-coated gold cluster on metastatic breast 
cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and tumor-induced osteolysis in vivo, 
and elucidated its possible mechanism. Methods: Breast cancer cell line 
MDA-MB-231 was used to evaluate the regulatory effects of gold clusters on 
breast cancer metastasis and tumor induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Cell 
counting kit-8, transwell, wound-healing and colony formation assays were 
performed to evaluate the effect of gold clusters on proliferation and
