BACKGROUND: Worrying changes in life expectancy trends have been observed 
recently in the UK, largely attributed to austerity policies introduced over the 
last decade. To incorporate changes to quality, rather than just length of, 
life, our aim was to describe trends in healthy life expectancy (HLE) for the 
relevant period.
METHODS: In the absence of available long-term trends, we calculated new 
estimates of HLE for Scotland for the period 1995-2019, using standard HLE 
methodologies based on mortality and national survey data, and stratified by sex 
and socioeconomic deprivation.
RESULTS: Overall, male and female HLE increased markedly between 1995 and 2009, 
but then decreased by approximately 2 years between 2011 and 2019. A decline was 
observed for the most and least deprived groups, but this was larger for those 
living in the 20% most deprived areas, where the decrease was 3.5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are further evidence of changing levels of 
pre-pandemic population health in the UK. An increasing body of UK and 
international evidence have attributed these changes to UK Government austerity 
policies. There is an urgent need, therefore, to reverse cuts to social security 
and protect the income and health of the poorest across all of the UK.

Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia.

INTRODUCTION: Dupilumab is an effective and safe medicine for the management of 
severe asthma. Due to its high cost, concerns are generated regarding its 
cost-effectiveness. This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of dupilumab 
plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone in children between 6 and 11 years 
old with severe asthma and eosinophilic phenotype.
METHODS: A Markov-type model was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes 
of a simulated cohort of pediatric patients with persistent asthma treated over 
a 6-year period. To determine the robustness of the model deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient estimated were 0.85 
with dupilumab and 0.84 with SoC. The total mean of discounted costs per patient 
per cycle were US$ 379 for dupilumab and US$ 19 for SoC. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio estimated was $24 660 US$ per QALY CONCLUSION: 
Dupilumab is not cost-effective in Colombia in children between 6 and 11 years 
old with severe asthma and eosinophilic phenotype. Our evidence should motivate 
regulatory agencies to improve negotiations for new drugs with better 
information and evidence.

There is growing interest in cost-effectiveness thresholds as a tool to inform 
resource allocation decisions in health care. Studies from several countries 
have sought to estimate health system opportunity costs, which supply-side 
cost-effectiveness thresholds are intended to represent. In this paper, we 
consider the role of empirical estimates of supply-side thresholds in 
policy-making. Recent studies estimate the cost per unit of health based on 
average displacement or outcome elasticity. We distinguish the types of point 
estimates reported in empirical work, including marginal productivity, average 
displacement, and outcome elasticity. Using this classification, we summarise 
the limitations of current approaches to threshold estimation in terms of 
theory, methods, and data. We highlight the questions that arise from 
alternative interpretations of thresholds and provide recommendations to 
policymakers seeking to use a supply-side threshold where the evidence base is 
emerging or incomplete. We recommend that: (1) policymakers must clearly define 
the scope of the application of a threshold, and the theoretical basis for 
empirical estimates should be consistent with that scope; (2) a process for the 
assessment of new evidence and for determining changes in the threshold to be 
applied in policy-making should be created; (3) decision-making processes should 
retain flexibility in the application of a threshold; and (4) policymakers 
should provide support for decision-makers relating to the use of thresholds and 
the implementation of decisions stemming from their application.

Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common orthopaedic injuries and the 
incidence is growing with increasing life expectancy. Several randomized 
controlled studies have shown the advantages of intramedullary devices over hip 
screw fixation in unstable intertrochanteric fractures. However, the proven 
advantage of the intramedullary device in stable intertrochanteric fractures, 
OTA (Orthopaedic Trauma Association) classification 31-A1 and some 31-A2 
fractures are in less blood loss compared with standard hip screw fixation. In 
the current technical note, we describe a novel minimally invasive technique of 
hip screw fixation that use a keyhole size incision to fix stable 
intertrochanteric fractures using sliding hip screw. The less invasive nature 
and potentially reduced blood loss makes this technique an attractive option for 
stabilizing stable intertrochanteric hip fractures.

INTRODUCTION: Although child and adolescent health is the core of the global 
health agenda, the cause of death and its expected contribution to life 
expectancy (LE) among those aged 5-14 are under-researched across countries, 
especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHODS: Death rates per 10 years age group including a 5-14-year-old group were 
calculated by the formula, which used the population and the number of deaths 
segmented by the cause of death and gender from the 2019 Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study. LE and cause-eliminated LE in 10-year intervals were 
calculated by using life tables.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global mortality rate for children and adolescents aged 
5-14 years was 0.522 (0.476-0.575) per 1,000, and its LF was 71.377 years. In 
different-income regions, considerable heterogeneity remains in the ranking of 
cause of death aged 5-14 years. The top three causes of death in low-income 
countries (LICs) are enteric infections [0.141 (0.098-0.201) per 1,000], other 
infectious diseases [0.103 (0.073-0.148) per 1,000], and neglected tropical 
diseases and malaria [0.102 (0.054-0.172) per 1,000]. Eliminating these 
mortality rates can increase the life expectancy of the 5-14 age group by 0.085, 
0.062, and 0.061 years, respectively. The top three causes of death in 
upper-middle income countries (upper MICs) are unintentional injuries [0.066 
(0.061-0.072) per 1,000], neoplasm [0.046 (0.041-0.050) per 1,000], and 
transport injuries [0.045 (0.041-0.049) per 1,000]. Eliminating these mortality 
rates can increase the life expectancy of the 5-14 age group by 0.045, 0.031, 
and 0.030 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The mortality rate for children and adolescents aged 5-14 years 
among LMICs remains high. Considerable heterogeneity was observed in the main 
causes of death among regions. According to the main causes of death at 5-14 
years old in different regions and countries at different economic levels, 
governments should put their priority in tailoring their own strategies to 
decrease preventable mortality.

UK.

The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) began in the 
mid-1990s, using an accelerated longitudinal design and drawing a representative 
sample of over 6200 children from a total of seven birth cohorts (ages 0 to 18) 
living in Chicago. Participants were followed for a second and third wave of 
data collection ending in 1998 and 2002, respectively. Independent surveys and 
observations on Chicago neighborhoods were also conducted. In 2012, a random 
subsample from cohorts 0, 9, 12, and 15 was selected for further follow-up, 
resulting in 1057 wave 4 interviews. In 2021, a fifth wave was launched to 
locate and survey wave 4 respondents, resulting in 682 responses. The extension 
to waves 4 and 5, termed the PHDCN+, is the main focus of this cohort profile. 
Survey data were collected from many domains including, but not limited to, 
family relationships, exposure to violence and guns, neighborhood context, 
self-reported crime, encounters with the police, attitudes toward the law, 
health, and civic engagement. In addition, official criminal records were 
collected for 1995-2020. The resulting PHDCN+ data includes five waves of 
comprehensive survey data, residential histories, neighborhood contextual data, 
and criminal histories extending over 25 years for four cohorts differing in age 
by up to 15 years. The research design, measures, key findings from the cohort 
sequential design, and data access opportunities are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Low bone mineral density (LBMD), including osteoporosis and low bone 
mass, has becoming a serious public health concern. We aimed to estimate the 
disease burden of LBMD and its related fractures in 204 countries and 
territories over the past 30 years.
METHODS: We collected detailed information and performed a secondary analysis 
for LBMD and its related fractures from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. 
Numbers and age-standardized rates related to LBMD of disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) and deaths in 204 countries and territories were compared by 
age, gender, socio-demographic index (SDI), and location.
RESULTS: Global deaths and DALYs number attributable to LBMD increased from 207 
367 and 8 588 936 in 1990 to 437 884 and 16 647 466 in 2019, with a raise of 
111.16% and 93.82%, respectively. DALYs and deaths number of LBMD-related 
fractures increased 121.07% and 148.65% from 4 436 789 and 121248 in 1990 to 9 
808 464 and 301 482 in 2019. In 2019, the five countries with the highest 
disease burden of DALYs number in LBMD-related fractures were India (2 510 288), 
China (1 839 375), United States of America (819 445), Japan (323 094), and 
Germany (297 944), accounting for 25.59%, 18.75%, 8.35%, 3.29%, and 3.04%. There 
was a quadratic correlation between socio-demographic index (SDI) and burden of 
LBMD-related fractures: DALYs rate was 179.985-420.435SDI+417.936SDI2(R2 = 
0.188, p<0.001); Deaths rate was 7.879-13.416SDI+8.839 SDI2(R2 = 0.101, 
p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of DALYs and deaths associated with LBMD and its 
related fractures has increased significantly since 1990. There were differences 
in disease burden between regions and countries. These estimations could be 
useful in priority setting, policy-making, and resource allocation in 
osteoporosis prevention and treatment.

Normalized Prices as a Forecasting Tool.

Kossov VV(1).

Author information:
(1)National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia.

In 2020, the retail price for a kilogram of butter in Russia was 638.69 rubles. 
The same price, but divided by GDP per capita, was 0.008757. Let's call the 
resulting value the normalized price. The same normalized price for 1 kg of 
butter (0.008757) was in the United States and Sweden in 1949, and Australia in 
1969. This allows data from more developed countries to be used to forecast 
prices in less developed countries for many years to come. To predict the 
normalized price, it is converted into a logarithm, which is decomposed into two 
components: international and national. The international component ln (Int) is 
determined by the laws of the market. The second, national, component ln (Nat) 
is determined by the peculiarities of the country's policy. Arithmetically, it 
is the difference between the logarithms of the normalized price and the 
international component. The anomalousness of retail prices for butter in 
Russia, expressed in rubles during 1999-2020 is shown. In this period the prices 
were changing only in one direction-they were growing, which reflects the lack 
of competition on the market. The dynamics of normalized prices is described by 
the alternation of descending and ascending waves. On a descending wave, 
normalized prices go down-commodity availability increases, while an ascending 
wave corrects for a decline in rationed prices. According to the data of 
Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand, USA, France and Sweden for 1801-2019, 
the average values of normalized prices were calculated for each year. It 
becomes clear that short series of the average values of normalized prices by 
country are lined up in a kind of parade of planets, which makes it easier to 
predict them. For ex-post forecast of normalized prices, the period 1801-2019 is 
divided into two parts: before and after 2010. Regression coefficients-weights 
for extrapolation of normalized prices for 2011-2019 are estimated according to 
the first part. Ex-post forecast is made according to the second part and 
compared with the actual values. The resulting differences are forecast errors. 
The independent variables of the model are the life expectancy of newborn males 
and the price of gold in US dollars. The mean square errors of such forecasts 
for each of the countries turned out to be LESS than the standard error of the 
equation used to estimate the regression parameters. In Russia, the actual 
prices for butter exceeded the ex-post forecast for 2016-2019. To characterize 
this excess, you can use the definition of "greed" proposed by the Prime 
Minister of the Russian Federation M. Mishustin.

Hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis is a rare but life-threatening 
multi-systemic disease with clustering areas in, for example, northern Sweden. 
Until the 1990s, only symptomatic treatments were available but liver 
transplantation has, in selected patients, been a good therapeutic option since. 
The first disease-modifying drug for ATTRv amyloidosis was approved in 2011 and 
since then, the development of new therapeutic drugs has been rapid and 
successful. Two gene silencing therapies were approved for the disease in 2018, 
both showing a robust reduction in serum transthyretin levels and a satisfactory 
safety profile. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has also shown promising 
results in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis. The recent developments have had a 
paramount effect on the management of these patients, and will probably also 
have a significant positive effect on their life expectancy. However, treatment 
costs have skyrocketed, which implies future challenges.

AIMS: This study contributes to previous initiatives examining healthy and 
active aging in the Philippines.
METHODS: We employed the Sullivan method to calculate healthy life expectancy 
(HLE) and active life expectancy (ALE) using the 2007 Philippine Survey on Aging 
and the 2018 Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Health. We compared the estimates 
at two time points, providing evidence of change over time.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant change in the relative 
proportion of HLE over time for both sexes, suggesting dynamic equilibrium. For 
men, the increase in life expectancy was mainly an increase in unhealthy state 
(UHLE). The slight increases in HLE for all ages were not statistically 
significant. The differences in relative increase in HLE were not statistically 
significant. HLE for women increased over time, with statistically significant 
increases at ages 60 and 70 years. ALE declined in all age groups for both 
sexes, but the decline was statistically significant only among women in their 
60s and 70s. There was also a statistically significant decline in the 
proportion of remaining life in an active state for all ages among both men and 
women, suggesting an expansion of morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest no evidence of compression of morbidity in the 
Philippines from 2007 to 2018. The HLE results suggest a dynamic equilibrium, 
while ALE results indicate an expansion of morbidity. The findings emphasize the 
need for the government to promote life course interventions that foster healthy 
choices and conduct further research to understand the factors influencing 
longevity and active aging in the Philippines. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22:

INTRODUCTION: Currently, it is not known what attributes of health care 
interventions citizens consider important in disinvestment decision-making (i.e. 
decisions to discontinue reimbursement). Therefore, this study aims to 
investigate the preferences of citizens of the Netherlands toward the relative 
importance of attributes of health care interventions in the context of 
disinvestment.
METHODS: A participatory value evaluation (PVE) was conducted in April and May 
2020. In this PVE, 1143 Dutch citizens were asked to save at least €100 million 
by selecting health care interventions for disinvestment from a list of eight 
unlabeled health care interventions, described solely with attributes. A 
portfolio choice model was used to analyze participants' choices.
RESULTS: Participants preferred to disinvest health care interventions resulting 
in smaller gains in quality of life and life expectancy that are provided to 
older patient groups. Portfolios (i.e. combinations of health care 
interventions) resulting in smaller savings were preferred for disinvestment 
over portfolios with larger savings.
CONCLUSION: The disinvestment of health care interventions resulting in smaller 
health gains and that are targeted at older patient groups is likely to receive 
most public support. By incorporating this information in the selection of 
candidate interventions for disinvestment and the communication on disinvestment 
decisions, policymakers may increase public support for disinvestment.

Background: In 2017, 45% of rural adults reported being directly impacted by the 
opioid epidemic. While research on the experiences of those using prescription 
opioids in rural communities is increasing, less is known about a unique 
sub-population who may have high rates of exposure: rural agricultural workers. 
The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence and perceptions related 
to prescription opioids among rural producers and farmworkers. Methods: A 
questionnaire was mailed in spring 2019 and spring 2020 to rural residents 
living in one of two agricultural-based states in the Upper Midwest. Individuals 
were eligible to participate if any member of their family was involved in the 
agricultural industry. A total of 1116 questionnaires were returned for a 27.9% 
response rate. Results: Participants were 68.1 years old on average. The 
majority identified as white, male, and married. Prescription opioid use was 
found in 8.2% of households currently, and 15.7% in the past year. There were no 
gender differences in prevalence of use, but women and older individuals 
reported significantly more perceived risk than men and younger individuals. 
Nearly half used alternative pain management, and received most information 
about prescription opioids from the radio (65.5%) and newsletters (13.5%). 
Conclusions. Despite their elevated age and working in an occupation at high 
risk of injury and chronic pain, study participants reported few opioid 
prescriptions and moderate use of alternative pain management. Perceived risk of 
prescription opioids may explain low prevalence. Outreach efforts that increase 
access to healthcare services and alternative pain management treatments for 
agricultural workers may mitigate the experience of chronic pain that can 
interfere with their overall quality of life.

PURPOSE: In this study we aimed to identify the molecular genetic cause of a 
progressive multisystem disease with prominent lipodystrophy.
METHODS: In total, 5 affected individuals were investigated using exome 
sequencing. Dermal fibroblasts were characterized using RNA sequencing, 
proteomics, immunoblotting, immunostaining, and electron microscopy. Subcellular 
localization and rescue studies were performed.
RESULTS: We identified a lipodystrophy phenotype with a typical facial 
appearance, corneal clouding, achalasia, progressive hearing loss, and variable 
severity. Although 3 individuals showed stunted growth, intellectual disability, 
and died within the first decade of life (A1, A2, and A3), 2 are adults with 
normal intellectual development (A4 and A5). All individuals harbored an 
identical homozygous nonsense variant affecting the retention and splicing 
complex component BUD13. The nucleotide substitution caused alternative splicing 
of BUD13 leading to a stable truncated protein whose expression positively 
correlated with disease expression and life expectancy. In dermal fibroblasts, 
we found elevated intron retention, a global reduction of spliceosomal proteins, 
and nuclei with multiple invaginations, which were more pronounced in A1, A2, 
and A3. Overexpression of both BUD13 isoforms normalized the nuclear morphology.
CONCLUSION: Our results define a hitherto unknown syndrome and show that the 
alternative splice product converts a loss-of-function into a hypomorphic 
allele, thereby probably determining the severity of the disease and the 
survival of affected individuals.

INTRODUCTION: This study quantitatively described the disease burden of diabetes 
and kidney disease attributable to non-optimal temperatures and explored the 
influencing factors.
METHODS: We quantitatively described the mortality burden of diabetes and kidney 
disease attributable to non-optimal temperatures in six countries (China, USA, 
South Africa, Australia, Iraq, Portugal), and compare trends in mortality in six 
countries from 1990 to 2019. We used the APC model to analyse age, period, and 
cohort effects on mortality in six countries. We used restricted cubic splines 
and quantile regression to analyse the association of SDI with mortality and YLL 
using data from 21 regions in the world.
RESULTS: The mortality rates of diabetes and kidney disease in the six countries 
in 2019 were 1.72% (Australia), 1.83% (China), 2.99% (USA), 3% (Portugal), 7.45% 
(South Africa) and 8.71% (Iraq) attributable to non-optimal temperatures. Cold 
was more harmful than heat. The mortality, YLLs of diabetes and kidney disease 
of male were higher than females. The mortality rate showed an upwards trend 
with age. The period effect had little changes or showed a slight upwards trend. 
The cohort effect showed a downwards trend. The regions with higher mortality or 
YLLs rates were mainly had SDI values of 0.45-0.80.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the death burdens of diabetes and kidney disease attributed 
to non-optimal temperatures, cold had a greater burden than heat. The burden of 
death was affected by sex, age, period, cohort, and SDI.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with spinal metastases often receive palliative surgery or 
radiation therapy to maintain or improve health-related quality of life. 
Patients with unrealistic expectations regarding treatment outcomes have been 
shown to be less satisfied with their post-treatment health status. This study 
evaluated expectations of patients with spinal metastases scheduled for surgery 
and/or radiation therapy.
METHODS: Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with patients with 
symptomatic spinal metastases before and 6 weeks after surgery and/or radiation 
therapy. Expectations regarding treatment outcomes were discussed before 
treatment, and level of fulfillment of these pretreatment expectations was 
discussed after treatment. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed 
according to the thematic analysis method to identify themes.
RESULTS: Before treatment, patients thought they were not, or minimally, 
informed about (expected) treatment outcomes, but they felt well informed about 
treatment procedures and possible complications. Although patients expected pain 
relief and improvement in daily functioning, they found it difficult to describe 
any recovery timeline or the impact of these expected improvements on their 
daily life. Patients generally understood that treatment was not curative, but 
lacked insight into the impact of treatment on life expectancy given that this 
was hardly discussed by their surgeon and/or radiation oncologist. Pretreatment 
expectations regarding pain and daily functioning were only partially met in 
most patients post-treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients thought they were not, or only minimally, informed about 
expected outcomes after surgery and/or radiation therapy for symptomatic spinal 
metastases. Improvements in patient-physician communication and counseling could 
help guide patients toward realistic pretreatment expectations.

There is growing interest in, but limited data about, intestinal bile acid 
transport inhibitors as treatment for cholestatic liver disease. The current 
analyses combine two similar randomized placebo-controlled trials with 
subsequent extension phases investigating the impact of maralixibat in children 
with severe cholestasis secondary to Alagille Syndrome (n = 57). The primary 
outcomes were measures of pruritus (ItchRO[Obs]) and clinician scratch scale 
(CSS), both increasing in severity from 0 to 4) and quality of life (QoL) 
(Parent PedsQL and Multidimensional Fatigue Scale module [MFS] scaled 0-100 with 
increased QoL) at week 48 of the extension phase relative to the baseline of the 
placebo-controlled trials (week 13). Secondary assessments included other 
clinical and biochemical parameters assessed in participants at week 72 or end 
of treatment (after week 48). At week 48, statistically and clinically 
significant least square mean (95% CI) improvements in pruritus and QoL were 
observed (ItchRO[Obs] -1.59 [-1.81, -1.36], CSS -1.36 [-1.67, -1.05], PedsQL 
+10.17 [4.48, 15.86], and multidimension fatigue [MFS] +13.97 [7.85, 20.08]). At 
week 48, serum bile acids, platelet count, and cholesterol decreased, whereas 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased and total bilirubin (TB) and albumin 
were stable. Changes were durable at week 72 and end of treatment. There were no 
deaths; 2 participants underwent liver transplantation. Study drug was 
discontinued in 9 participants after treatment-emergent adverse events, 6 of 
which were events of increased ALT or TB. Conclusion: Maralixibat administration 
was associated with marked improvement in pruritus and QoL. Interpretation of 
these findings is complicated by the complex natural history of severe 
cholestasis in Alagille syndrome.

Eldercare programs such as health consultations and physiotherapy that improve 
the well-being and extend the life expectancy of people in rural or sparsely 
populated areas is a socially important though costly problem. We ran a pilot 
project to test the effectiveness potential of telerehabilitation using 
markerless motion capture technology integrated in a fast and low-latency 
IMT-2020 (5G) mobile network. Accelerating technological innovations and the 
surge in advances of telehealth will greatly impact conventional home visit or 
outpatient rehabilitation services, working in concert with or even supplanting 
them, given the potential lower cost and better utilization of time.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy and the aging population of most 
countries, attention to the diseases of old age has also increased. Due to the 
high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly, the present study was 
designed and performed to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin D 
levels in Iranian elderly with the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS).
METHODS: This study was conducted on an elderly population of Birjand (60 and 
older) in the urban and rural areas of the city. In 1325 elderly men and women, 
with age range of 60 and older, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, anthropometric 
measurements and laboratory variables were measured.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of the elderly participants in the study had 
vitamin D deficiency. We found that participants with higher 25(OH)D had lower 
odds for elevated waist circumference (WC) (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-0.98), 
reduced HDL (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-0.97) and elevated fasting blood sugar (FBS) 
(OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-0.98). We not found any significant association between 
25(OH)D levels and other MetS components.
CONCLUSION: Higher 25(OH)D levels in the elderly are linked to a reduced 
prevalence of MetS and, specifically, higher levels of favorable HDL-C, WC and 
FBS. Further intervention studies are needed to substantiate the results of this 
study.
