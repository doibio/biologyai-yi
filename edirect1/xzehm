The COVID-19 pandemic has put a lot of pressure on all the world's health 
systems and public health leaders who have often found themselves unprepared to 
handle an emergency of this magnitude. This study aims to bring together 
published evidence on the qualities required to leaders to deal with a public 
health issue like the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping literature review was 
conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A search of relevant 
articles was performed in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. A 
total of 2499 records were screened, and 45 articles were included, from which 
93 characteristics of effective leadership were extrapolated and grouped into 6 
clusters. The qualities most frequently reported in the articles were human 
traits and emotional intelligence (46.7%) and communication skills such as 
transparency and reliability (48.9%). Responsiveness and preparedness (40%), 
management skills (33.3%) and team working (35.6%) are considered by a 
significant percentage of the articles as necessary for the construction of 
rapid and effective measures in response to the emergency. A considerable 
proportion of articles also highlighted the need for leaders capable of making 
evidence-based decisions and driving innovation (31.1%). Although identifying 
leaders who possess all the skills described in this study appears complex, 
determining the key characteristics of effective public health leadership in a 
crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, is useful not only in selecting future 
leaders but also in implementing training and education programmes for the 
public health workforce.

PURPOSE: Improvements in life expectancy have resulted in an increasing number 
of adults with cerebral palsy, of which over a third will have neurogenic lower 
urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). This review explores urinary dysfunction in 
adults with cerebral palsy.
METHODS: Relevant literature on NLUTD in adults with cerebral palsy was 
identified using an unrestricted search of PubMed.
RESULTS: Urinary incontinence is the most common complaint, often accompanied by 
frequency and urgency. Special consideration should be given to women and in 
those with worse motor or cognitive dysfunction as they have been shown to have 
more severe urologic symptoms. NLUTD can have significant morbidity and impact 
quality of life. Hospital admission, urinary tract infections, and 
hydronephrosis are common urologic complications, with poor urinary function 
associated with decreased quality of life (QOL). Neurogenic detrusor 
overactivity is the most common urodynamic abnormality, with elevated detrusor 
leak point pressure and reduced bladder capacity. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergy 
is present in some patients and maybe secondary to generalized spasticity or 
incomplete upper motor neuron injury. Elevated bladder capacity is also present 
in a portion of patients, and becomes particularly relevant in adults as a 
result of increased spasticity of the urinary sphincter. Conservative management 
like functional toileting strategies, medications, and incontinence aids are 
successful in most patients. Medical management with anticholinergics is well 
described, and frequently the only intervention required, particularly in 
children. Intermittent clean catheterization has mixed results with this 
population, as its efficacy is limited by pelvic spasticity and patient factors. 
Surgical intervention, while often successful, should be restricted to select 
patients, as it is associated with significant morbidity in this population.
CONCLUSION: Management of NLUTD in adults with CP involves conservative 
management, medications, and in rare cases surgical intervention.

RNA Interference and Neuromuscular Diseases: A Focus on Hereditary Transthyretin 
Amyloidosis.

Neuromuscular diseases are severe disorders affecting the peripheral nervous 
system, usually driving to death in a limited time. Many new drugs, through 
RNA-interference technology, are revolutionizing the prognosis and quality of 
life for these patients. Nevertheless, given the increased life expectancy, some 
new issues and phenotypes are expected to be revealed. In the 
transthyretin-mediated hereditary amyloidosis (ATTR-v, "v" for "variant"), the 
RNA interference was demonstrated to effectively reduce the hepatic synthesis of 
transthyretin, with a significant increase in disease progression in terms of 
polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. The increased life expectancy could promote 
the involvement of organs where the extra-hepatic transthyretin is deposited, 
such as the brain and eye, which are probably not targeted by the available 
treatments. All these issues are discussed in this editorial.

INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial diseases are rare, heterogeneous, incurable and 
complex to diagnose. Probably due to their rareness, there is still a lack of 
literacy in this area, especially in society, but also in schools and in 
general, health care services. Accordingly, tools that may bring advancement in 
science and health literacy are needed. Mit.OnOff is a science communication 
project based on a bilateral partnership between the University of Coimbra 
(Portugal) and the University of Bergen (Norway). It aims to inform society 
about rare diseases related to mitochondrial cytopathies with an emphasis on 
LHON.
METHODS: The initiative focuses on the creation of an illustrated book 
explaining the diseases caused by the failure of energy production in simple and 
accessible language. The aim is to raise awareness (particularly in Portugal and 
Norway) and provide in-depth knowledge to people suffering from these diseases.
RESULTS/CASE REPORT: This project involves expert scientists in the field of 
mitochondrial disease, science communicators and artists in alignment with the 
United Nations SDGs, Agenda 2030. Mit.OnOff is a bilateral partnership (Portugal 
and Norway) established to address the lack of knowledge and health literacy on 
the subject of mitochondrial disease. The book will be distributed in both 
countries, creating a sense of inclusion and visibility and influencing 
decisions regarding these diseases. It is a relevant educational medium (e.g., 
schools, health care provision). The distribution of the book is complemented 
with other communication materials. Oral communications are made, together with 
public involvement, in which special glasses will be distributed to simulate a 
mitochondrial disease that leads to blindness (LHON) for the public to 
experience what it is like living with a rare disease.
CONCLUSION: It is hoped that the production of this book will give patients a 
sense of inclusion and representation in the media. This, in turn, will 
contribute to achieving the SDG targets (3,4,5,8,10,12), i.e., ensuring people 
live healthy lives, reducing child mortality, and increasing life expectancy, 
ensuring access to inclusive, equitable and quality education for all, ensuring 
gender equality, and contributing to a peaceful and prosperous world.

ABSTRACT: The dense nutritional structure of meat predisposes it to microbial 
spoilage and oxidative changes. Thus, the present study evaluated the 
antimicrobial and antioxidant effect of the edible coating of nanoparticles of 
chitosan and oregano essential oil on the quality and shelf-life of chicken 
patties. Total four types of edible coatings were prepared, viz. T1:0.3% 
chitosan; T2:0.3% chitosan incorporated with 0.3% v/v oregano essential oil; 
T3:0.3% chitosan nanoparticles and T4: nanoparticles of 0.3% chitosan 
incorporated with 0.3% v/v oregano essential oil which were characterized by 
UV-visible spectrophotometry, particle size analysis and High-Resolution 
Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). The chicken patties were dipped in 
developed edible coatings and evaluated for quality parameters at five days 
interval during refrigeration storage (4 ± 1 °C). The results indicated 
significantly (P < 0.05) improved physicochemical, microbiological, Hunter 
colour and sensory parameters in treatments than in control. Among the 
treatments, quality parameters were significantly enhanced in T4 than in other 
treatments. The results revealed that T3 and T4 had an improved shelf life of 
about 25 days while T1 and T2 had a shelf life of 15 and 20 days, respectively, 
but control spoiled on the 10th day of refrigeration storage.
GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: Edible coating of nanoparticles of chitosan alone (T3) as 
well as chitosan incorporated with incorporated with oregano essential (T4) oil 
were prepared and characterized by HR-TEM and UV-Vis Spectrophotometry. UV-Vis 
Spectrophotometry revealed that T3 and T4 had the absorption maximum of 209 nm 
and 276 nm, respectively. HR-TEM revealed that (T4) had a spherical shape, with 
average size ranging from 100 to 200 nm while (T3) had a smaller size ranging 
from 80 to 100 nm, with a rough surface having a dense structure. Upon coating 
of chicken patties with edible coatings, a significant improvement was observed 
in the quality and shelf-life of chicken patties than control during 
refrigeration storage (4±1 °C).

Aim: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating postmenopausal osteoporosis 
(PMO) with weekly gastro-resistant risedronate 35 mg gastro-resistant tablets 
(RIS-GR), compared with weekly alendronate 70 mg tablets (ALN) in Spain. 
Methods: A probabilistic analysis (second-order Monte Carlo simulation) was 
performed with a time horizon of 5 years, from the perspective of the Spanish 
National Health System. The bone fracture probabilities were obtained from a 
cohort study of 3614 women from USA with PMO treated with RIS-GR (1807) or ALN 
(1807) (Thomasius, 2022). The pharmacological cost and the cost of fractures 
were obtained from Spanish sources (€ 2022). The utilities of patients with and 
without fracture (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) were obtained from the 
medical literature. Results: Compared with ALN, treatment with RIS-GR can avoid 
79 fractures (between 75 and 82) every 1000 patients treated, and 0.0119 QALYs 
would be gained (between 0.0098 and 0.0140) per patient. Additionally, GR-RIS 
would generate a cost saving per patient of €1994 (€1437-2904) with a 
probability of 99.7%. The scenario analyses confirmed the stability of the base 
case results. Conclusion: According to this study, RIS-GR would be the dominant 
treatment (lower costs with QALY gain) compared with ALN.

This study analyzed the effect of the inclusion of legume-derived proteins, 
specifically pea and fava bean protein, with varying solubility levels on the 
expansion of corn starch. Three different proteins exhibiting low, medium, or 
high solubility were mixed with corn starch to obtain blends containing 15%, 
25%, and 35% (w/w) of the protein. Extrusion was performed on a twin-screw 
extruder at three different screw speeds (200, 400, and 600 rpm), a moisture 
content of 16% (w.b.), and a die temperature of 140°C. Obtained extrudates were 
analyzed for their expansion, unit density, and hydration properties, namely, 
water solubility index (WSI) and water absorption index (WAI). Extrudates 
containing the protein with the highest solubility showed different patterns 
than those that had proteins with low or medium solubility. Expansion ratio (ER) 
increased from a maximum of 3.55 ± 0.24 for pure corn starch up to 5.45 ± 0.43 
when incorporating 35% of the protein with medium solubility but significantly 
decreased down to 1.24 ± 0.08 when incorporating 35% of the most soluble 
protein. The influence on the system parameters, as well as on the hydration 
properties, was also greatest for the blends containing the protein with the 
highest solubility. Even though significant Pearson correlations were observed 
between protein solubility and ER (r = -0.579), unity density (r = 0.614), WSI 
(r = -0.634), torque (r = -0.612), as well as specific mechanical energy 
(r = -0.451), further research is needed to evaluate if the solubility is indeed 
the reason for certain behaviors or if other protein characteristics are more 
critical for expansion. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This manuscript provides 
practical information on the influence of the addition of legume-derived 
proteins with different solubility levels on direct expansion. The obtained 
results may help the industry with the selection of the appropriate proteins for 
inclusion levels in producing high protein direct-expanded extruded food 
products.

PURPOSE: To explore the disease burden of early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) 
in individuals aged 40-49 years and provide baseline evidence for routine 
recommended age adjustment for CRC screening and other clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We collected data stratified by sex, risk factors, and 
socio-demographic index (SDI) from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 Data 
Resources. Trends in disease burden were analyzed by estimated annual percentage 
change. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model predicted the burden over the 
following 10 years.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global rates of incidence, mortality, prevalence, and 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of EO-CRC in people aged 40-44 years were 
11.48 (95% uncertainty interval: 10.50-12.59), 4.35 (4.01-4.70), 72.63 
(66.48-79.52), 209.82 (193.55-226.59) per 100,000 population. For people aged 
45-49 years, the rates of these four estimates were 19.63 (17.97-21.54), 7.76 
(7.16-8.41), 121.73 (110.99-133.84), and 335.83 (310.14-362.91), respectively. 
The incidence and prevalence rates for both age groups increased while the 
mortality and DALY rates remained stable from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, high-income 
North America had the highest incidence and prevalence rates. A low milk diet 
accounted for the largest proportion of global DALYs in EO-CRC, and there was a 
tendency for the DALY rate first to increase and then decrease with increasing 
SDI. The incidence and mortality rates were predicted to increase in the next 
10 years.
CONCLUSION: The current and future burden of EO-CRC among people aged 
40-49 years is heavy. Substantial variation exists in disease burden across 
regions and countries. Urgent screening actions and policies are needed.

Loss of cognitive function with age is devastating. EGL-30/GNAQ and Gαq 
signaling pathways are highly conserved between C. elegans and mammals, and 
murine Gnaq is enriched in hippocampal neurons and declines with age. We found 
that activation of EGL-30 in aged worms triples memory span, and GNAQ gain of 
function significantly improved memory in aged mice: GNAQ(gf) in hippocampal 
neurons of 24-month-old mice (equivalent to 70- to 80-year-old humans) rescued 
age-related impairments in well-being and memory. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing 
revealed increased expression of genes regulating synaptic function, axon 
guidance, and memory in GNAQ-treated mice, and worm orthologs of these genes 
were required for long-term memory extension in worms. These experiments 
demonstrate that C. elegans is a powerful model to identify mammalian regulators 
of memory, leading to the identification of a pathway that improves memory in 
extremely old mice. To our knowledge, this is the oldest age at which an 
intervention has improved age-related cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological disease affecting 
around 1% of people above sixty years old. It is characterised by both motor and 
non-motor symptoms including tremor, slow movement, unsteady gait, constipation 
and urinary incontinence. As the disease progresses, individuals living with the 
disease are likely to lose their independence and autonomy, subsequently 
affecting their quality of life. People with PD should be supported to live well 
within their communities but there has been limited research regarding what the 
public know about PD. This review aims to develop an understanding of how the 
public view people living with PD, which has the potential to aid the 
development of an educational resource for the future to improve public 
awareness and understanding of PD. The purpose of this scoping review is to 
review and synthesise the literature on the public perception and attitudes 
towards people living with PD and identify and describe key findings.
AIM: This scoping review aims to explore public perceptions and awareness of 
Parkinson's Disease among diverse populations, encompassing beliefs, knowledge, 
attitudes, and the broader societal context influencing these perceptions.
METHODS: A scoping review of the literature was conducted following the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for 
ScR (PRISMA-ScR). Four electronic databases were searched systematically (CINAHL 
Plus, Medline, PsycINFO and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences). 
The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools (JBI) were used to assess 
the quality of primary studies, however, all relevant studies were considered 
regardless of their methodological quality. The 'Population-Concept-Context' 
framework was used in the screening process to identify eligible papers.
RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were included in the review representing global 
research in quantitative (n = 12) and mixed methods approaches (n = 11). All 23 
studies adopted some aspect of cross-sectional design. Three themes emerged from 
the studies, the first being public knowledge of symptoms, causes and treatment 
of PD and this highlighted a lack of understanding about the disease. Secondly, 
the review identified public attitudes towards PD, highlighting the social 
consequences of the disease, including the association between PD and 
depression, isolation and loss of independence. Finally, the third theme 
highlighted that there was a paucity of educational resources available to help 
increase public understanding of PD.
CONCLUSION: Findings from this scoping review have indicated that public 
awareness of PD is a growing area of interest. To our knowledge, this is the 
first scoping review on this topic and review findings have indicated that 
public knowledge and attitudes towards PD vary internationally. The implications 
of this are that people with PD are more likely to be a marginalised group 
within their communities. Future research should focus on understanding the 
perception of the public from the perspective of people with PD, the development 
of interventions and awareness campaigns to promote public knowledge and 
attitude and further high-quality research to gauge public perceptions of PD.

BACKGROUND: PROpel met its primary endpoint showing statistically significant 
improvement in radiographic progression-free survival with olaparib plus 
abiraterone versus placebo plus abiraterone in patients with first-line 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) unselected by homologous 
recombination repair mutation (HRRm) status, with benefit observed in all 
prespecified subgroups. Here we report the final prespecified overall survival 
analysis.
METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial done at 126 centres 
in 17 countries worldwide. Patients with mCRPC aged at least 18 years, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, a life expectancy of at least 
6 months, with no previous systemic treatment for mCRPC and unselected by HRRm 
status were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally by means of an interactive voice 
response system-interactive web response system to abiraterone acetate (orally, 
1000 mg once daily) plus prednisone or prednisolone with either olaparib 
(orally, 300 mg twice daily) or placebo. The patients, the investigator, and 
study centre staff were masked to drug allocation. Stratification factors were 
site of metastases and previous docetaxel at metastatic hormone-sensitive cancer 
stage. Radiographic progression-free survival was the primary endpoint and 
overall survival was a key secondary endpoint with alpha-control 
(alpha-threshold at prespecified final analysis: 0·0377 [two-sided]), evaluated 
in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was evaluated in all patients who 
received at least one dose of a study drug. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03732820, and is completed and no longer recruiting.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 31, 2018 and March 11, 2020, 1103 patients were screened, 
of whom 399 were randomly assigned to olaparib plus abiraterone and 397 to 
placebo plus abiraterone. Median follow-up for overall survival in patients with 
censored data was 36·6 months (IQR 34·1-40·3) for olaparib plus abiraterone and 
36·5 months (33·8-40·3) for placebo plus abiraterone. Median overall survival 
was 42·1 months (95% CI 38·4-not reached) with olaparib plus abiraterone and 
34·7 months (31·0-39·3) with placebo plus abiraterone (hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 
0·67-1·00; p=0·054). The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was anaemia 
reported in 64 (16%) of 398 patients in the olaparib plus abiraterone and 13 
(3%) of 396 patients in the placebo plus abiraterone group. Serious adverse 
events were reported in 161 (40%) in the olaparib plus abiraterone group and 126 
(32%) in the placebo plus abiraterone group. One death in the placebo plus 
abiraterone group, from interstitial lung disease, was considered treatment 
related.
INTERPRETATION: Overall survival was not significantly different between 
treatment groups at this final prespecified analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of infections among patients with psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), two distinct phenotypes 
included in the large group of spondyloarthritis (SpA), treated with tumour 
necrosis-factor-inhibitors, interleukin-17-inhibitors, Janus kinase-inhibitors, 
IL-23 or IL-12/23-inhibitors (IL-12/23i), phosphodiesterase 4-inhibitors or 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4-Ig.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), open-label 
extension and observational studies was conducted. Serious infections were 
defined as infections that were life-threatening, required intravenous 
antibiotics and/or hospitalisation. Non-serious infections did not meet these 
severity criteria. The incidence rates (IR) were reported for each diagnosis by 
treatment class and study type using random-effect model to create a 95% CI.
RESULTS: Among 23 333 PsA patients and 11 457 axSpA patients, there were 1.09 
serious infections per 100 patient-years (PY) (95% CI 0.85 to 1.35) with similar 
IR in PsA (0.96 per 100 PY 95% CI 0.69 to 1.28) and axSpA (1.09 per 100 PY 95% 
CI 0.76 to 1.46). The IR was lower in RCTs (0.77 per 100 PY 95% CI 0.41 to 1.20) 
compared with observational studies (1.68 per 100 PY 95% CI 1.03 to 2.47). In 
PsA patients, the lowest IR value was observed with IL-12/23i (0.29 per 100 PY 
95% CI 0.00 to 1.03). There were 53.0 non-serious infections per 100 PY (95% CI 
43.47 to 63.55) in 7257 PsA patients and 5638 axSpA patients. The IR was higher 
in RCTs (69.95 per 100 PY 95% CI 61.59 to 78.84) compared with observational 
studies (15.37 per 100 PY 95% CI 5.11 to 30.97).
CONCLUSION: Serious infections were rare events in RCTs and real-life studies. 
Non-serious infections were common adverse events, mainly in RCTs.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between type I collagen α1 chain 
(COL1α1) levels and coronary artery disease (CAD) by using absolute 
quantification in plasma. Also, to investigate the correlates of COL1α1 to 
clinical characteristics and circulating markers of collagen metabolism.
DESIGN: Life conditions, Stress and Health (LSH) study: prospective cohort 
study, here with a nested case-control design.Assessing Platelet Activity in 
Coronary Heart Disease (APACHE) study: prospective cohort study.
SETTING: LSH: primary care setting, southeast Sweden.APACHE: cardiology 
department, university hospital, southeast Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: LSH: 1007 randomly recruited individuals aged 45-69 (50% women). 
Exclusion criteria was serious disease. After 13 years of follow-up, 86 cases 
with primary endpoint were identified and sex-matched/age-matched to 184 
controls.
APACHE: 125 patients with myocardial infarction (MI), 73 with ST-elevation MI 
and 52 with non-ST-elevation MI.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Intervention study participation, warfarin treatment and 
short life expectancy.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the association 
between baseline COL1α1 and first-time major event of CAD, defined as 
fatal/non-fatal MI or coronary revascularisation after 13 years. Secondary 
outcomes were the association between the collagen biomarkers PRO-C1 (N-terminal 
pro-peptide of type I collagen)/C1M (matrix metalloproteinase-mediated 
degradation of type I collagen) and CAD; temporal change of COL1α1 after acute 
MI up to 6 months and lastly, correlates between COL1α1 and patient 
characteristics along with circulating markers of collagen metabolism.
RESULTS: COL1α1 levels were associated with CAD, both unadjusted (HR=0.69, 95% 
CI=0.56 to 0.87) and adjusted (HR=0.55, 95% CI=0.41 to 0.75). PRO-C1 was 
associated with CAD, unadjusted (HR=0.62, 95% CI=0.47 to 0.82) and adjusted 
(HR=0.61, 95% CI=0.43 to 0.86), while C1M was not. In patients with MI, COL1α1 
remained unchanged up to 6 months. COL1α1 was correlated to PRO-C1, but not to 
C1M.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma COL1α1 was independently and inversely associated with CAD. 
Furthermore, COL1α1 appeared to reflect collagen synthesis but not degradation. 
Future studies are needed to confirm whether COL1α1 is a clinically useful 
biomarker of CAD.

BACKGROUND: Clients with severe mental illness (SMI) have overall poor physical 
health. SMI reduces life expectancy by 5-17 years, primarily due to physical 
comorbidity linked to cardiometabolic risks that are mainly driven by unhealthy 
lifestyle behaviours. To improve physical health in clients with SMI, key 
elements are systematic somatic screening and lifestyle promotion. The nurse-led 
GILL eHealth was developed for somatic screening and the implementation of 
lifestyle activities in clients with SMI. Aims of this study are to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the GILL eHealth intervention in clients with SMI compared to 
usual care, and to evaluate the implementation process, and the experiences of 
clients and healthcare providers with GILL eHealth.
METHODS: The GILL study encompasses a cluster-randomised controlled trial in 
approximately 20 mental health care facilities in the Netherlands. The 
randomisation takes place at the team level, assigning clients to the eHealth 
intervention or the usual care group. The GILL eHealth intervention consists of 
two complementary modules for somatic screening and lifestyle promotion, 
resulting in personalised somatic treatment and lifestyle plans. Trained mental 
health nurses and nurse practitioners will implement the intervention within the 
multidisciplinary treatment context, and will guide and support the participants 
in promoting their physical health, including cardiometabolic risk management. 
Usual care includes treatment as currently delivered, with national guidelines 
as frame of reference. We aim to include 258 clients with SMI and a BMI of 27 or 
higher. Primary outcome is the metabolic syndrome severity score. Secondary 
outcomes are physical health measurements and participants' reports on physical 
activity, perceived lifestyle behaviours, quality of life, recovery, 
psychosocial functioning, and health-related self-efficacy. Measurements will be 
completed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. A qualitative process evaluation 
will be conducted alongside, to evaluate the process of implementation and the 
experiences of clients and healthcare professionals with GILL eHealth.
DISCUSSION: The GILL eHealth intervention is expected to be more effective than 
usual care in improving physical health and lifestyle behaviours among clients 
with SMI. It will also provide important information on implementation of GILL 
eHealth in mental health care. If proven effective, GILL eHealth offers a 
clinically useful tool to improve physical health and lifestyle behaviours.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle behaviours related to smoking, alcohol, nutrition, and 
physical activity are leading risk factors for the development of chronic 
disease. For people in rural areas, access to individualised lifestyle services 
targeting behaviour change may be improved by using telehealth. However, the 
scope of literature investigating telehealth lifestyle behaviour change 
interventions for rural populations is unknown, making it difficult to ascertain 
whether telehealth interventions require adaptation for rural context via a 
systematic review. This scoping review aimed to address this gap, by mapping 
existing literature describing telehealth lifestyle interventions delivered to 
rural populations to determine if there is scope for systematic review of 
intervention effectiveness in this research topic.
METHODS: The PRISMA extension for scoping review checklist guided the processes 
of this scoping review. A search of eight electronic databases reported in 
English language until June 2023 was conducted. Eligible studies included adults 
(18 years and over), who lived in rural areas of high-income countries and 
undertook at least one synchronous (video or phone consultation) telehealth 
intervention that addressed either addictive (smoking or alcohol), or 
non-addictive lifestyle behaviours (nutrition or physical activity). Studies 
targeting addictive and non-addictive behaviours were separated after full text 
screening to account for the involvement of addictive substances in smoking and 
alcohol studies that may impact behaviour change interventions described. 
Studies targeting nutrition and/or physical activity interventions are presented 
here.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 17179 citations across eight databases, 
with 7440 unique citations once duplicates were removed. Full texts for 492 
citations were retrieved and screened for inclusion with 85 publications 
reporting on 73 studies eligible for data extraction and analysis. Of this, 
addictive behaviours were comprised of 15 publications from 13 studies. 
Non-addictive behaviours included 70 publications from 58 studies and are 
reported here. Most interventions were delivered within the United States of 
America (n = 43, 74.1%). The most common study design reported was Randomised 
Control Trial (n = 27, 46.6%). Included studies involved synchronous telehealth 
interventions targeting nutrition (11, 18.9%), physical activity (5, 8.6%) or 
nutrition and physical activity (41, 70.7%) and were delivered predominately via 
videoconference (n = 17, 29.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in intervention characteristics, the number of 
randomised control trials published suggests sufficient scope for future 
systematic reviews to determine intervention effectiveness related to nutrition 
and physical activity telehealth interventions for rural populations.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The scoping review protocol was not pre-registered.
