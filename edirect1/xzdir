BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) represent the best evidence in 
oncology research. Glioblastoma is the most frequent and deadly primary brain 
tumor, affecting health-related quality of life. An important end point is 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs). There are no data regarding how well 
publications of glioblastoma RCTs report PROs. A specific PRO extension of the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was created to 
improve the quality of reporting. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
adherence to the CONSORT-PRO statement in reporting RCTs addressing the 
treatment of patients with glioblastoma. PRO analysis methodology was explored 
and criteria associated with higher quality of reporting were investigated.
METHODS: From PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases, all phase 2 and 
3 RCTs related to glioblastoma published between 1995 and 2018 were reviewed 
according to the CONSORT-PRO statements. An overall quality score on a 0 to 100 
scale was defined based on these criteria and factors associated with this score 
were identified.
RESULTS: Forty-four RCTs were identified as relevant according to predefined 
criteria. The median overall quality score was 26. No difference was observed 
regarding reporting quality over the years. CONSORT-PRO items concerning data 
collection and analysis were poorly reported. Thirty-four trials (77%) used 
longitudinal data. The most frequent statistical method for PROs analysis was 
the mean change from baseline (63%). Factors associated with improved overall 
quality score were the presence of a secondary publication dedicated to PROs 
results, the statement of any targeted dimensions, and when trials reported 
results using multiple methods.
CONCLUSION: Despite the importance of measuring PROs in patients with 
glioblastoma, employment of the CONSORT-PRO statement is poor in RCTs.

Survey, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, U.S.A. 66044.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy varies across geographical and political 
landscapes for a multitude of reasons. Severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the 2020 coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) and pandemic, is present in 215 countries, and is described 
as a pathogen that is most deadly to individuals 65 years and older. However, it 
is unclear if the majority of COVID-19-related deaths are targeting individuals 
above or below life expectancy.
METHODS: Through seven months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an association 
between life expectancy and COVID-19 related deaths was assessed. The reported 
age of those suffering from COVID-19-related deaths was evaluated across eight 
countries (United States, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, 
and Switzerland), and placed into binary categories depending on whether or not 
the death occurred above or below the country's life expectancy.
RESULTS: Given this dataset, it was observed that there was a greater proportion 
of COVID related deaths above life expectancy (M=64.58%, SD=6.46) as opposed to 
below life expectancy (M=35.41%, SD=6.46), as these differences were significant 
(95%CI [18.518, 42.881], p<0.001). In contrast, an insignificant trend was 
observed when examining the relationship between deaths above life expectancy 
and Gini index (Pearson correlation coefficient r= -0.62, n=8, p=0.09). The 
disparity, or percent difference in death occurring above versus below life 
expectancy was greatest in the countries with life expectancies of 80+ (Sweden, 
Switzerland, Germany).
CONCLUSIONS: Considering life expectancy may be an appropriate approach for 
reporting COVID-19-related deaths, as well as planning responses to localized 
COVID-19 outbreaks, prioritizing drug treatment, and assessing ICU capacity.

PURPOSE: Given the current life expectancy and number of individuals living with 
Down syndrome (DS), it is important to learn common occurrences of disease 
conditions across the developmental lifespan. This study analyzed data from a 
large cohort of individuals with DS in an effort to better understand these 
disease conditions, inform future screening practices, tailor medical care 
guidelines, and improve utilization of health care resources.
METHODS: This retrospective, descriptive study incorporated up to 28 years of 
data, compiled from 6078 individuals with DS and 30,326 controls matched on age 
and sex. Data were abstracted from electronic medical records within a large 
Midwestern health system.
RESULTS: In general, individuals with DS experienced higher prevalence of 
testicular cancer, leukemias, moyamoya disease, mental health conditions, 
bronchitis and pneumonia, gastrointestinal conditions, thyroid disorder, 
neurological conditions, atlantoaxial subluxation, osteoporosis, dysphagia, 
diseases of the eyes/adnexa and of the ears/mastoid process, and sleep apnea, 
relative to matched controls. Individuals with DS experienced lower prevalence 
of solid tumors, heart disease conditions, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, 
influenza, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, and diabetes. Similar rates of 
prevalence were seen for lymphomas, skin melanomas, stroke, acute myocardial 
infarction, hepatitis, cellulitis, and osteoarthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: While it is challenging to draw a widespread conclusion about 
comorbidities in individuals with Down syndrome, it is safe to conclude that 
care for individuals with DS should not automatically mirror screening, 
prevention, or treatment guidelines for the general U.S. population. Rather, 
care for those with DS should reflect the unique needs and common comorbidities 
of this population.

AIMS: Valvular surgery has improved long-term prognosis in severe carcinoid 
heart disease (CaHD). Experience is limited and uncertainty remains about 
predictors for survival and strategy regarding single vs. double-valve surgery. 
The aim was to review survival and echocardiographic findings after valvular 
surgery for CaHD at our institution.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2019, 60 consecutive patients, median age 
64 years, underwent valve surgery for severe CaHD. Operations involved combined 
tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) and pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in 42 
cases, and TVR-only or TVR with pulmonary valvotomy (no PVR) in 18 patients. All 
implanted valves were bioprosthetic. Preoperative echocardiography, creatinine, 
NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), and 24-h urinary 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were obtained. 30-Day mortality was 12% 
(n=7), and 8% for the most recent decade 2010-2019. Median survival was 2.2 
years and maximum survival 21 years. Patients undergoing combined TVR and PVR 
had significantly higher survival compared with operations without PVR (median 
3.0 vs. 0.9 years, P = 0.02). Preoperative levels of NT-pro-BNP and 5-HIAA in 
the top quartile predicted poor survival. On preoperative echocardiograms, 
pulmonary regurgitation was severe in 51% and indeterminate in 17%. 
Postoperative echocardiography confirmed relatively good durability of 
bioprostheses, relative to the patients' limited oncological life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Valvular surgery in CaHD has an acceptable perioperative risk. 
Survival for combined TVR and PVR was significantly higher compared with 
operations without PVR. Bioprosthetic valve replacement appears to have adequate 
durability. Preoperative echocardiography may underestimate pulmonary pathology. 
Combined TVR and PVR should be considered in most patients.

Background: Life expectancy has increased markedly in the past decades. Thus, it 
is of great importance to understand how people are ageing and if the 
trajectories of health and disability are changing over time. This study aimed 
to examine trends in functional abilities and health in independent cohorts of 
people aged 75-95 over three decades. Methods: This Helsinki Ageing Study 
consists of repeated cross-sectional postal surveys examining independent 
cohorts of old people (75, 80, 85 and 90+ years old). This study combined data 
from four waves (1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019). Results: In the most recent wave, 
there was an increase in the portion of participants who were able to walk 
outdoors easily (75-year-olds p=0.03, 80-year-olds p=0.002, 85-year-olds 
p<0.001; p for linearity for the study year effect, all adjusted for sex). Fewer 
people in the youngest age group (75-year-olds) needed daily help from another 
person in 2019 compared to the earlier waves (p=0.02 for linearity for the study 
year). Over the past three decades, the proportions of self-reported good 
mobility have risen 8.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-15.1) in 
75-year-olds, 11.7% (95% CI 3.9-19.6) in 80-year-olds and 20.1% (95% CI 
10.7-29.4) in 85-year-olds, after adjusting for sex. Furthermore, in 2019, more 
people rated their health as good and scored better in psychological well-being 
than in the previous waves among 75-, 80- and 85-year-olds. However, no 
improvements were found among 90+-year-olds in any of these variables. 
Conclusions: People between 75 and 85 years old are presently feeling and 
functioning better than their predecessors. This may be an important objective 
for both economics and health policy.

Piophilidae are a relatively small family of Diptera that is frequently 
associated with cadavers at advanced stages of decomposition and are, therefore, 
considered potentially useful forensic indicators. However, their use in 
forensic investigations is typically hampered by a deficiency in reliable 
identification tools. This is particularly evident in countries such as South 
Korea, where forensic entomology is still in its infancy and the diversity of 
forensically relevant insect taxa remains largely undocumented. In the present 
study, we used cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcodes to identify samples 
of piophilid larvae collected during medicolegal investigations performed in 
South Korea. A total of 174 COI sequences were obtained and have been made 
publicly available, thus augmenting the reference barcode library for 
forensically important Piophilidae species. Of the 174 sequenced samples, 172 
were identified as Stearibia nigriceps (Meigen), whereas the two remaining 
samples may represent a previously unsequenced piophilid species. Stearibia 
nigriceps is recorded from South Korea for the first time, and our results 
suggest that it might be a particularly relevant forensic indicator in certain 
case types and scenarios in that country. The findings of this study highlight 
the utility of COI barcodes for achieving accurate identification of 
entomological samples, even by non-specialist forensic practitioners. They also 
contribute to the further development and consolidation of forensic entomology 
in South Korea and eastern Asia.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of trifluridine/tipiracil 
(FTD/TPI) compared with best supportive care (BSC) for the treatment of patients 
with metastatic gastric cancer(mGC), including gastroesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma(GEJ), who have received at least two prior therapies for 
metastatic disease and are eligible for third-line treatment, in Greece.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was locally adapted from a public payer 
perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical, safety and utility data were 
extracted from literature. Resource consumption data obtained from a panel of 
local experts using a questionnaire developed for the study was combined with 
unit costs obtained from official sources. All costs reflect the year 2020 (€). 
Outcomes of the model were patients' life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per 
QALY and LY gained.
RESULTS: The total cost per patient was estimated to be €6,965 for FTD/TPI and 
€1,906 for BSC, while FTD/TPI was associated with 0.180 and 0.107 increments in 
LYs and QALYs, respectively, compared with BSC, resulting in an ICER of €47,144 
per QALY gained and €28,112 per LY gained.
CONCLUSION: FTD/TPI was estimated to be a cost-effective treatment option for 
eligible third line mGC patients, including GEJ in Greece.

The article considers the results of sociological study that was carried out to 
determine vector of dynamics of indices regulating duration of life of the 
Russian population, including the expected one. The method of secondary analysis 
of statistical and sociological information data was applied. Results. Against 
the background of decreasing of birth rate, "aging of population", migration 
inflows and transformation of value systems the reduction of population size in 
The Russian Federation (natural loss) dominates, though life expectancy itself 
is slightly increasing. The high value of indicator of «death external causes» 
is established. The trend of steady decreasing of infant mortality in Russia 
over the past 27 years is marked. The groups of factors affecting life 
expectancy of the Russian population is identified. The main characteristics are 
revealed that are fundamentally important to ensure higher life expectancy of 
Russians. One of the demographic behavior models in modern Russia is described. 
The approaches to solve demographic problems in the Russian Federation, proposed 
by state bodies on the basis of policy documents (Concept of demographic 
development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2025, etc.) are 
considered. The importance of health-preserving projects (such as "Moscow 
longevity", etc.), is determined.

The article considers the results of legal regulation analysis of medical care 
support including medication maintenance of adult patients suffering from rare 
diseases exemplified by life-threatened and chronic progressed rare (orphan) 
diseases resulting in life expectancy decrease and or disability ("List-24").
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Law database was analyzed in terms of current orders of 
medical care provision, standards of medical care, and clinical guidelines for 
rare diseases from "List-24" regarding to adult patients.
RESULTS: It is concluded that there are no determined rules of medical care 
provision to adult population in case of rare diseases from "List-24". There are 
standards of medical care on 6 rare diseases (25% of total diseases amount) from 
this list for adult patients. However, based on content analysis data of 
approved standards it was established that there are only 3 from 11 standards 
(27.28%) for primary medical care support, 4 standards (33.34%) for medical care 
provision in planned condition, and only 1 standard (9.09%) had appropriate 
legal basis for its development (clinical guidelines availability). 
Nevertheless, there is negative prognosis for this the only standard due to 
legal necessity of all clinical guidelines revision till the end of 2021.
CONCLUSION: Revision and creation of clinical guidelines and standards of 
medical care afterwards are needed for adult patients treatment with rare 
diseases from "List-24". The conclusion was made in terms of medical care 
standardization improvement for adult patients suffering from rare diseases from 
"List-24" based on its alignment with current legal regulation.

physical development, morbidity of infectious and mental diseases, mortality and 
life expectancy. The mentioned data are compared with indices of ecological 
pollution, drinking water and foodstuff quality. The study results are explained 
by political decisions on reclamation of unsettled territories, developing of 
all-Union constructions, (anti)alcohol campaigns.

BACKGROUND: Available national public data are often too incomplete and noisy to 
be used directly to interpret the evolution of epidemics over time, which is 
essential for making timely and appropriate decisions. The use of compartment 
models can be a worthwhile and attractive approach to address this problem. The 
present study proposes a model compartmentalized by sex and age groups that 
allows for more complete information on the evolution of the CoViD-19 pandemic 
in Italy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Italian public data on CoViD-19 were pre-treated with a 
7-day moving average filter to reduce noise. A time-varying 
susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased (SIRD) model distributed by age and sex 
groups was then proposed. Recovered and infected individuals distributed by 
groups were reconstructed through the SIRD model, which was also used to 
simulate and identify optimal scenarios of pandemic containment by vaccination. 
The simulation started from realistic initial conditions based on the SIRD model 
parameters, estimated from filtered and reconstructed Italian data, at different 
pandemic times and phases. The following three objective functions, accounting 
for total infections, total deaths, and total quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) lost, were minimized by optimizing the percentages of vaccinated 
individuals in five different age groups.
RESULTS: The developed SIRD model clearly highlighted those pandemic phases in 
which younger people, who had more contacts and lower mortality, infected older 
people, characterized by a significantly higher mortality, especially in males. 
Optimizing vaccination strategies yielded different results depending on the 
cost function used. As expected, to reduce total deaths, the suggested strategy 
was to vaccinate the older age groups, whatever the baseline scenario. In 
contrast, for QALYs lost and total infections, the optimal vaccine solutions 
strongly depended on the initial pandemic conditions: during phases of high 
virus diffusion, the model suggested to vaccinate mainly younger groups with a 
higher contact rate.
CONCLUSION: Because of the poor quality and insufficient availability of 
stratified public pandemic data, ad hoc information filtering and reconstruction 
procedures proved essential. The time-varying SIRD model, stratified by age and 
sex groups, provided insights and additional information on the dynamics of 
CoViD-19 infection in Italy, also supporting decision making for containment 
strategies such as vaccination.

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of 
positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, along with an increased risk of 
metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease that contribute to a 15-20-year 
reduced life expectancy. Autonomic dysfunction, in the form of increased 
sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity, is postulated to be 
implicated in SCZ and its treatment. The aim of this narrative review is to view 
SCZ through an autonomic lens and synthesize the evidence relating autonomic 
dysfunction to different domains of SCZ. Using various methods of assessing 
autonomic activity, autonomic dysfunction was found to be associated with 
multiple aspects of SCZ pathophysiology, including symptom severity, cognitive 
impairment, and the development of cardiometabolic comorbidities, such as 
metabolic syndrome and high BMI. The strongest association of low heart rate 
variability was noted among patients on antipsychotic treatment with 
high-affinity muscarinic antagonism (i.e., clozapine, olanzapine and 
quetiapine). The review will also suggest ways in which studying autonomic 
dysfunction can help reduce morbidity and mortality associated with SCZ and its 
treatment.

GDF15 is a distant TGF-β family member that induces anorexia and weight loss. 
Due to its function, GDF15 has attracted attention as a potential therapeutic 
for the treatment of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. However, the 
pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties of GDF15 present several 
challenges for its development as a therapeutic, including a short half-life, 
high aggregation propensity, and protease susceptibility in serum. Here, we 
report the design, characterization and optimization of GDF15 in an Fc-fusion 
protein format with improved therapeutic properties. Using a structure-based 
engineering approach, we combined knob-into-hole Fc technology and N-linked 
glycosylation site mutagenesis for half-life extension, improved solubility and 
protease resistance. In addition, we identified a set of mutations at the 
receptor binding site of GDF15 that show increased GFRAL binding affinity and 
led to significant half-life extension. We also identified a single point 
mutation that increases p-ERK signaling activity and results in improved weight 
loss efficacy in vivo. Taken together, our findings allowed us to develop GDF15 
in a new therapeutic format that demonstrates better efficacy and potential for 
improved manufacturability.

Fumigant use in perennial crops can be reduced through prolonging the life of 
existing orchards. The longer an orchard remains healthy and productive, the 
less often it will be terminated, fumigated, and replanted. Two trials were 
conducted to determine the effectiveness of DiTera, a toxin produced by the 
fungus (Myrothecium verrucaria) and Nema-Q, an extract of the soap bark tree 
(Quillaja saponaria) for management of root-lesion (Pratylenchus vulnus) and 
ring (Mesocriconema xenopla) nematodes on walnuts. In the first trial, spring 
and fall treatments of DiTera were applied each year for four years to variety 
'Chandler' scion on seedling 'Paradox' rootstock, and to own-rooted 'Chandler' 
trees. On 'Paradox' rootstock, both DiTera and Nema-Q increased walnut yields 
(P ≤ 0.05) and produced more vigorous trees (P ≤ 0.05) without significant 
reductions in nematode populations (P ≤ 0.05). A second trial was conducted with 
three rates of DiTera and four rates of Nema-Q, combinations of the two 
products, and an untreated control on 'Chandler' scion on 'Paradox' rootstock. 
The highest rate of Nema-Q (P ≤ 0.05), and a combination treatment of DiTera 
plus Nema-Q (P ≤ 0.05) increased trunk circumference. Several treatments showed 
reductions in root-lesion and ring nematodes (P ≤ 0.05). Bionematicides can 
improve yield, growth, and vigor in walnut orchards infested with 
plant-parasitic nematodes.

BACKGROUND: Patients experiencing relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) have limited treatment options and poor prognosis. 
Tisagenlecleucel (TIS) has shown improved clinical outcomes, but at a high 
upfront cost. Singapore has a multi-payer healthcare system where private 
insurance is one of the major payers. This study evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness and budget impact of TIS against salvage chemotherapy regimen 
(SCR) for treating r/r DLBCL patients who have failed ≥2 lines of systemic 
therapy from Singapore's private insurance payer's perspective.
METHODS: Over a life-time horizon, a partitioned survival model with three 
health-states was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of TIS vs. SCR 
with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Efficacy inputs 
for TIS and SCR were based on 43 months of observation data from pooled JULIET 
and UPenn trials, and CORAL extension studies respectively. Direct costs for 
pre-treatment, treatment, adverse events, follow-up, subsequent-HSCT, relapse, 
and terminal care were included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
were calculated as the total incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. Additionally, the financial implication of introducing TIS in 
Singapore from a private payer's perspective was analyzed, comparing the current 
treatment pathway (without TIS) with a future scenario (with TIS) over 5 years.
RESULTS: Compared with SCR, TIS was the dominant option, with cost savings of 
S$8,477 alongside an additional gain of 2.78 QALYs in privately insured patients 
who shifted from private to public hospitals for TIS treatment. Scenario 
analyses for patients starting in public hospitals show ICERs of S$99,623 (no 
subsidy) and S$133,261 (50% subsidy for SCR treatment, no subsidy for TIS), 
supporting the base case. The projected annual budget impact ranges from 
S$850,000 to S$3.4 million during the first 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: TIS for treating r/r DLBCL patients who have failed ≥2 lines of 
systemic therapies, is likely to be cost effective with limited budget impact.

Research on healthy life expectancy (HLE) that considers cognitive impairment 
has been inadequate, particularly in the context of less developed countries. 
Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, our study 
fills this research gap by computing active life expectancy (ALE), 
cognitive-impairment-free life expectancy (CIFLE), and active and 
cognitive-impairment-free life expectancy (ACIFLE) for China's older population, 
using multistate life tables. Results show that at age 60, the three life 
expectancies were 19.4 years (ALE), 9.5 years (CIFLE), and 8.8 years (ACIFLE) 
during the period 2011-13. HLE exhibits significant differentials by sex, 
urban/rural residence, educational level, marital status, and health status at 
age 60. Among China's older people, males and those living in urban areas 
experience higher CIFLE, and those who live with a spouse, are more educated, 
and are healthy at age 60 expect more years in good health according to all 
three HLE measures.Supplementary material for this article is available at:

Many of the world's warm-blooded species are chronically infected with 
Toxoplasma gondii tissue cysts, including an estimated one-third of the global 
human population. The cellular processes that permit long-term persistence 
within the cyst are largely unknown for T. gondii and related coccidian 
parasites that impact human and animal health. Herein, we show that genetic 
ablation of TgATG9 substantially reduces canonical autophagy and compromises 
bradyzoite viability. Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous 
structural abnormalities occurring in ∆atg9 bradyzoites. Intriguingly, abnormal 
mitochondrial networks were observed in TgATG9-deficient bradyzoites, some of 
which contained numerous different cytoplasmic components and organelles. ∆atg9 
bradyzoite fitness was drastically compromised in vitro and in mice, with very 
few brain cysts identified in mice 5 weeks post-infection. Taken together, our 
data suggests that TgATG9, and by extension autophagy, is critical for cellular 
homeostasis in bradyzoites and is necessary for long-term persistence within the 
cyst of this coccidian parasite.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic neurological diseases are a major cause of mortality and 
morbidity in the world. With increasing life expectancy in the developing world, 
the incidence and prevalence of these diseases are predicted to rise even 
further. This has also contributed to an increase in disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) for noncommunicable diseases. Treatment for such diseases also 
poses a challenge with multiple genetic and epigenetic factors leading to a 
varied outcome. Personalization of treatment is one way that treatment 
outcome/prognosis of disease can be improved, and pharmacogenomics plays a 
significant role in this context.
METHODOLOGY: This article reviewed the evidence pertaining to the association of 
genetic and epigenetic markers with major neurological disorders like multiple 
sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), which 
are a major source of burden among neurological disorders. Types of studies 
included are peer-reviewed original research articles from the PubMed database 
(1999-2018).
RESULTS: This study compiled data regarding specific genetic and epigenetic 
markers with a significant correlation between the clinical diagnosis of the 
disease and prognosis of therapy from 65 studies. In a single platform, this 
review highlights the clues to some vital questions, such as why interferon beta 
(IFN-β) therapy fails to improve symptoms in all MS patients? why cholinesterase 
inhibitors fail to improve cognitive impairment in a subset of people suffering 
from AD? or why some individuals on levodopa (L-DOPA) for PD suffer from 
side-effects ranging from dyskinesia to hallucination while others do not?
CONCLUSION: This article summarizes the genetic and epigenetic factors that may 
either require monitoring or help in deciding future pharmacotherapy in a 
patient suffering from MS, AD, and PD. As the health care system develops and 
reaches newer heights, we expect more and more of these biomarkers to be used as 
pharmacotherapeutic outcome indicators.

Introduction: Individual acupuncture (AP) is the gold standard method of AP 
delivery for cancer-related pain; however, costs can be prohibitive. Group AP 
allows four to six patients to be treated in a single session. This study sought 
to examine the cost-utility of group AP compared with individual AP from a 
patient perspective. Materials and Methods: Effectiveness and cost data from a 
noninferiority randomized trial of group versus individual AP for cancer-related 
pain were used. In the trial, 74 patients were randomly assigned to individual 
or group AP treatments twice per week for 6 weeks. The EuroQol five-dimension 
five level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess health-related quality of 
life, and the EQ-5D Utility Index was used as a composite measure constituted of 
five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, anxiety-depression, and 
pain-discomfort). Linear mixed models were used to compare the change in 
EQ-5D-5L states pre-post intervention between the two arms. A cost-utility 
analysis was performed in terms of the incremental costs per additional 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: Group AP participants 
experienced more significant relief in the pain-discomfort subscale of the 
EQ-5D-5L measure compared with individual AP participants (group × time, 
F = 6.18; p = 0.02). The effect size on pain-discomfort for group AP (d = 0.80) 
was higher than that of individual AP (d = 0.34). There were no significant 
differences between the two study arms for other subscales of the EQ-5D-5L over 
time. QALYs at 6 weeks were slightly higher for group AP (0.020) compared with 
individual AP (0.007) leading to an incremental QALY gained by the group arm of 
0.013, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). The 
cost of delivering AP treatment for the group arm over 6 weeks ($201.25) was 
nearly half of the individual arm ($400). Conclusions: Group AP was superior to 
individual AP in cancer patients. These findings have implications for the use 
of group AP in low-resource settings and in health care systems where AP for 
cancer patients is not covered by public health insurance. ClinicalTrials.gov

INTRODUCTION: Anemia during pregnancy is a public health problem that leads to 
different life-threatening complications and poor pregnancy outcomes. So far, 
the evidence is scarce on pooled prevalence and determinants of anemia during 
pregnancy in East Africa for integrated intervention. Therefore, this study 
aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of anemia among pregnant women 
in eastern Africa using recent Demographic and Health Surveys.
METHOD: Secondary data analysis was conducted using data from recent Demographic 
and Health Survey datasets from 10 East African countries. A total of 8583 
(weighted sample) pregnant women were included in the analysis. The multi-level 
mixed-effects generalized linear model (Poisson regression with robust error 
variance) was fitted to identify determinants of anemia. Finally, the adjusted 
prevalence ratio (aPR) with 95% CI and random effects for the multilevel 
generalized linear mixed-effects model was reported.
RESULTS: In this study, the overall prevalence of anemia among pregnant women 
was 41.82% (95% CI: 40.78, 42.87) with a large difference between specific 
countries which ranged from 23.36% in Rwanda to 57.10% in Tanzania. In the 
multi-level analysis, teenage pregnant women (aPR = 1.22;95%CI:1.02, 1.40), 
unmarried women (aPR = 1.14; 95% CI;1.02,1.28), pregnant women who had 
unimproved toilet facility (aPR = 1.17;95%CI:1.06,1.27), and those women from 
countries with high illiteracy level (aPR = 1.12;95%CI; 1.07,1.18) had a higher 
prevalence of anemia during pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: Anemia is still a public health problem in East Africa. Therefore, 
enabling the households to have improved toilet facilities by strengthening the 
existing health extension program, reducing teenage pregnancy, and improving the 
community literacy level is vital to reduce the prevalence of anemia during 
pregnancy in East Africa.

BACKGROUND: Access to timely neurosurgical care in particular remains limited 
worldwide, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, a decrease 
in overall life expectancy, and catastrophic economic costs. To date, access to 
neurosurgical care has not been completely studied and reported in the Caribbean 
neurosurgical literature. In this study, we aim to understand the geographic 
distribution of hospital facilities with neurosurgical capacity among the
