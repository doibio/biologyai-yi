corresponding values were 4.4° (range: 2.8-8.5°) with no stress applied, 5.5° 
(range: 3.3-9.0°) with varus stress, and 5.6° (range: 3.3-11.9°) with valgus 
stress.
DISCUSSION: Acceptable precision and accuracy may be possible when measuring 
knee kinematics in early flexion using a non-invasive system; however, we do not 
believe passive trackers should be mounted with rubber strapping such as was 
used in this study. Flexing the knee appears to decrease the precision and 
accuracy of the system. The functions of this new software using image-free 
navigation technology have many potential clinical applications, including 
assessment of bony and soft tissue deformity, pre-operative planning, and 
post-operative evaluation, as well as in further pure research comparing 
kinematics of the normal and pathological knee.

The surgical experience of the sub-occipital approach for treatment of pineal 
gland and pineal region tumors is reported. This approach was originally 
proposed by Jamieson and modified by Lapras who by changing the shape of the 
bone flap obtained the elevation of the occipital lobe which consequently 
resulted in a better exposition of this deep region. The reason why this 
approach became the basis for their treatment is particularly related to the 
personal experience of Lapras who reported his fantastic experience of surgery 
in this deep area and demonstrated the advantages of the sub-occipital 
transtentorial approach.
MATERIAL: Out of 277 patients operated from 1982 to 2012 in Lyon for a pineal 
tumor, 233 were treated by a sub-occipital approach: 153 males, 125 females, 
75 patients of pediatric age. The majority of patients were operated on in a 
sitting position which represents a surgical specialty of the anesthesiological 
school of Lyon.
RESULTS: Complete tumor removal was possible in 135 patients (58%) and partial 
in 60 patients (26%). For 38 patients, it was not possible to establish the 
quality of surgical resection. The incidence of hemianopsia decreased to less 
that 2% of cases while the incidence of severe pneumocephaly which requires a 
prolonged intensive care hospitalization was less than 4% of cases. Mortality 
related to this surgical approach in the Lyonnais school series was 0% during 
this period.
CONCLUSION: In our experience the sub-occipital transtentorial approach seems to 
us the best approach for pineal tumors because it permits a large exposition of 
the pineal region favoring the removal of the tumor with a lateral extension and 
also for tumors extending low into the posterior cranial fossa. In fact, this is 
our preferred approach because it has been used in a large majority of cases. 
However, surgeons have to be familiar with other possible approaches to obtain 
the best result in terms of removal and also to decrease the rate of sequelae to 
improve the quality of life of these patients.

Specialised CF care has led to a dramatic improvement in survival in CF: in the 
last four decades, well above what was seen in the general population over the 
same period. With the implementation of newborn screening in many European 
countries, centres are increasingly caring for a cohort of patients who have 
minimal lung disease at diagnosis and therefore have the potential to enjoy an 
excellent quality of life and an even greater life expectancy than was seen 
previously. To allow high quality care to be delivered throughout Europe, a 
landmark document was published in 2005 that sets standards of care. Our current 
document builds on this work, setting standards for best practice in key aspects 
of CF care. The objective of our document is to give a broad overview of the 
standards expected for screening, diagnosis, pre-emptive treatment of lung 
disease, nutrition, complications, transplant/end of life care and psychological 
support. For comprehensive details of clinical care of CF, references to the 
most up to date European Consensus Statements, Guidelines or Position Papers are 
provided in Table 1. We hope that this best practice document will be useful to 
clinical teams both in countries where CF care is developing and those with 
established CF centres.

A significant increase in life expectancy in successive birth cohorts of people 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) is a result of more effective treatment for the 
disease. It is also now widely recognized that outcomes for patients cared for 
in specialist CF Centres are better than for those who are not. Key to the 
effectiveness of the specialist CF Centre is the multidisciplinary team (MDT), 
which should include consultants, clinical nurse specialist, microbiologist, 
physiotherapist, dietitian, pharmacist, clinical psychologist, social worker, 
clinical geneticist and allied healthcare professionals, all of whom should be 
experienced in CF care. Members of the MDT are also expected to keep up to date 
with developments in CF through continued professional development, attendance 
at conferences, auditing and involvement in research. Specialists CF Centres 
should also network with other Centres both nationally and internationally, and 
feed Centre data to registries in order to further the understanding of the 
disease. This paper provides a framework for the specialist CF Centre, including 
the organisation of the Centre and the individual roles of MDT members, as well 
as highlighting the value of CF organisations and disease registries.

Treating the two extremes in renal cell carcinoma: management of small renal 
masses and cytoreductive nephrectomy in metastatic disease.

Center, Houston, TX.

The incidental renal mass represents a heterogeneous group that contains both 
benign and malignant pathologies. The majority of renal cell carcinomas are 
discovered incidentally, without the presence of symptoms directly related to 
the mass, and are closely associated with the term small renal masses because of 
the discovery before the onset of symptoms. In general, small renal masses are 
defined as 4 cm or smaller, and may account for greater than half of renal cell 
carcinoma diagnosis. The use of renal mass biopsy may offer additional 
pathological information but the clinician must be reminded of the technical and 
diagnostic limitations of renal mass biopsy. Patient-dependent factors, such as 
life expectancy and comorbidities, guide the management of small renal masses, 
which include active surveillance, partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, and 
ablative techniques (cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation). Partial 
nephrectomy has demonstrated durable oncologic control for small renal masses 
while preserving renal function and, if feasible, is the current treatment of 
choice. In the other extreme of the renal cell carcinomas spectrum and in the 
presence of metastatic disease, the removal of the renal primary tumor is termed 
cytoreductive nephrectomy. Two randomized trials (SWOG 8949 and EORTC 30947) 
have demonstrated a survival benefit with cytoreductive nephrectomy before the 
initiation of immunotherapy. These two studies have also been the motivation to 
perform cytoreductive nephrectomy in the targeted therapy era. Currently, there 
are two ongoing randomized prospective trials accruing to investigate the timing 
and relevance of cytoreductive nephrectomy in the contemporary setting of 
targeted therapy.

BACKGROUND: Generic preference-based measures of health like the EQ-5D and 
SF-6D(®) are increasingly being used in economic evaluation and outcome 
assessment. However, there are concerns as to whether or not these generic 
measures are appropriate for use in people with mental health problems.
OBJECTIVES: The EQ-5D and SF-36(®) (including its derivatives the SF-12(®) and 
SF-6D) were assessed using the psychometric criteria of validity and 
responsiveness using quantitative and qualitative methods. Another aim was to 
estimate mapping functions between the EQ-5D and SF-6D and condition-specific 
measures, where appropriate.
DESIGN: Four studies were undertaken to examine the appropriateness of the 
measures: (1) a systematic review of quantitative evidence on validity and 
responsiveness; (2) a further quantitative assessment of these criteria using 
existing data sets; (3) a review of qualitative research on the quality of life 
of people with mental health problems; and (4) qualitative semistructured 
interviews of people with a full range of problems. A fifth study estimated 
mapping functions between mental health-specific measures and the EQ-5D and 
SF-6D.
SETTING: A choice of venue was offered for the interviews including the 
participant's own home, a room at the university or a centre frequently used by 
mental health services.
PARTICIPANTS: The interviews were undertaken with 19 people with a broad range 
of mental health problems at varying levels of severity.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The reviews included the EQ-5D and SF-36 (and the SF-12 
and SF-6D). The psychometric analysis included the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS), Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome 
Measure (CORE-OM), Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), General 
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
RESULTS: (1) and (2) The EQ-5D and SF-36 achieved an adequate level of 
performance in depression, and to some extent in anxiety and personality 
disorder. Results from the psychometric analyses in schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder have been more mixed. (3) A framework analysis of 13 studies identified 
six major themes. (4) The interview data fitted the themes from the review well 
and resulted in minor modifications to the themes. The final set of themes 
comprised: well-being and ill-being; control, autonomy and choice; 
self-perception; belonging; activity; hope and hopelessness; and physical 
health.
CONCLUSIONS: The EQ-5D and SF-36 achieved mixed results in the quantitative 
testing against psychometric criteria. The qualitative analysis suggests this is 
because they provide a very limited coverage of themes identified by people with 
mental health problems. Recommendations for future work include the development 
of new preference-based measures in mental health that are based on, or 
substantially revise, an existing measure.

A robust probe for lighting up intracellular telomerase via primer extension to 
open a nicked molecular beacon.

China.

A nicked molecular beacon (MB)-functionalized probe has been designed for in 
situ imaging and detection of intracellular telomerase activity. The nick 
separates the MB into two segments: a shorter telomerase primer (TSP) sequence 
as a part of the 5'-end stem and a longer sequence to form a loop with one 
thiol-labeled 3'-end stem. The MB can be opened by substitutional hybridization 
of the telomerase-triggered stem elongation product, which leads to separation 
of the Cy5 at the 5'-end nick from the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) as the 
nanocarrier and thus inhibits the energy transfer from Cy5 to AuNP. Upon 
endocytosis of the probe, the TSP can be extended by intracellular telomerase at 
its 3' end to produce the telomeric repeated sequence, which leads to the inner 
chain substitution and thus turns on the fluorescence of Cy5. The probe provides 
a one-step incubation technique for quantification and monitoring of the 
telomerase activity in living cells. The practicality of the proposed approach 
for distinguishing tumor cells from normal cells and monitoring the decrease of 
telomerase activity during treatment with antitumor drugs demonstrates its 
potential in clinical diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring.

AIM: When considering the health of elderly individuals, extending a healthy 
lifespan as well as the average life expectancy has been discussed. In general, 
life expectancy is determined by biological health, socioeconomic factor, and 
social disparities. However, the effects of fatal diseases, such as cancer, 
socioeconomic factor, and self-rated health on the average life expectancy and 
healthy life expectancy have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: In the present study, a multiple regression analysis was used to 
clarify the relationships between the lifespan and socio-economic conditions, 
such as the GDP, GiNi index, age-adjusted mortality from cancer, suicide rate 
and self-rated health in 27 European countries.
RESULTS: According to the multiple regression analysis, the average life 
expectancy was significantly correlated with mortality from cancer (β=-0.816, 
P=0.001), whereas the healthy life expectancy was significantly correlated with 
self-rated health (β=0.759, p=0.001) in males. In females, the average life 
expectancy was significantly correlated with mortality from cancer (β=-0.470, 
p=0.004), whereas the healthy life expectancy was significantly correlated with 
self-rated health (β=0.605, p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that there is a significant correlation 
between cancer and life expectancy. Meanwhile, self-rated health is an important 
factor for increasing the longevity of a healthy life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION:  Sleep curtailment is an endemic behavior in modern society. 
Well-controlled laboratory studies have shown that sleep loss in young adults is 
associated with increased desire for high-calorie food and obesity risk. 
However, the relevance of these laboratory findings to real life is uncertain. 
We conducted a 3 week, within-participant, intervention study to assess the 
effects of extended bedtimes on sleep duration and food desire under real life 
conditions in individuals who are at risk for obesity.
METHODS:  Ten overweight young adults reporting average habitual sleep duration 
of less than 6.5 h were studied in the home environment. Habitual bedtimes for 
1-week (baseline) were followed by bedtimes extended to 8.5 h for 2-weeks 
(intervention). Participants were unaware of the intervention until after the 
baseline period. Participants received individualized behavioral counseling on 
sleep hygiene on the first day of the intervention period. Sleep duration was 
recorded by wrist actigraphy throughout the study. Participants rated their 
sleepiness, vigor and desire for various foods using visual analog scales at the 
end of baseline and intervention periods.
RESULTS:  On average, participants obtained 1.6 h more sleep with extended 
bedtimes (5.6 vs. 7.1; P < 0.001) and reported being less sleepy (P = 0.004) and 
more vigorous (P = 0.034). Additional sleep was associated with a 14% decrease 
in overall appetite (P = 0.030) and a 62% decrease in desire for sweet and salty 
foods (P = 0.017). Desire for fruits, vegetables and protein-rich nutrients was 
not affected by added sleep.
CONCLUSIONS:  Sleep duration can be successfully increased in real life settings 
and obtaining adequate sleep is associated with less desire for high calorie 
foods in overweight young adults who habitually curtail their sleep.

This article describes major topics discussed from the 'Economics of Physical 
Inactivity Consensus Workshop' (EPIC), held in Vancouver, Canada, in April 2011. 
Specifically, we (1) detail existing evidence on effective physical inactivity 
prevention strategies; (2) introduce economic evaluation and its role in health 
policy decisions; (3) discuss key challenges in establishing and building health 
economic evaluation evidence (including accurate and reliable costs and clinical 
outcome measurement) and (4) provide insight into interpretation of economic 
evaluations in this critically important field. We found that most 
methodological challenges are related to (1) accurately and objectively valuing 
outcomes; (2) determining meaningful clinically important differences in 
objective measures of physical inactivity; (3) estimating investment and 
disinvestment costs and (4) addressing barriers to implementation. We propose 
that guidelines specific for economic evaluations of physical inactivity 
intervention studies are developed to ensure that related costs and effects are 
robustly, consistently and accurately measured. This will also facilitate 
comparisons among future economic evidence.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of docetaxel versus weekly paclitaxel in adjuvant 
treatment of regional breast cancer in New Zealand.

Programme, University of Otago-Wellington, PO Box 7343, 23 Mein Street, Newtown, 
Wellington, New Zealand.

BACKGROUND: There have been recent important changes to adjuvant regimens and 
costs of taxanes for the treatment of early breast cancer, requiring a 
re-evaluation of comparative cost effectiveness. In particular, weekly 
paclitaxel is now commonly used but has not been subjected to cost-effectiveness 
analysis.
AIM: Our aim was to estimate the cost effectiveness of adjuvant docetaxel and 
weekly paclitaxel versus each other, and compared with standard 3-weekly 
paclitaxel, in women aged ≥25 years diagnosed with regional breast cancer in New 
Zealand.
METHODS: A macrosimulation Markov model was used, with a lifetime horizon and 
health system perspective. The model compared 3-weekly docetaxel and weekly 
paclitaxel versus standard 3-weekly paclitaxel (E1199 regimen) in the hospital 
setting. Data on overall survival and toxicities (febrile neutropenia and 
peripheral neuropathy) were derived from relevant published clinical trials. 
Epidemiological and cost data were derived from New Zealand datasets. Health 
outcomes were measured with health-adjusted life-years (HALYs), similar to 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs included intervention and health 
system costs in year 2011 values, with 3% per annum discounting on costs and 
HALYs.
RESULTS: The mean HALY gain per patient compared with standard 3-weekly 
paclitaxel was 0.51 with weekly paclitaxel and 0.21 with docetaxel, while 
incremental costs were $NZ 12,284 and $NZ 4,021, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of docetaxel versus 3-weekly paclitaxel was $NZ 
19,400 (purchasing power parity [PPP]-adjusted $US 13,100) per HALY gained, and 
the ICER of weekly paclitaxel versus docetaxel was $NZ 27,100 ($US 18,300) per 
HALY gained. In terms of net monetary benefit, weekly paclitaxel was the optimal 
strategy for willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds >$NZ 27,000 per HALY gained. 
However, the model was highly sensitive to uncertainty around survival 
differences, while toxicity-related morbidity had little impact. Thus, if it was 
assumed that weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel had the same efficacy, docetaxel 
would be favoured over weekly paclitaxel.
CONCLUSION: Both weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel are likely to be cost effective 
compared with standard 3-weekly paclitaxel. Weekly paclitaxel was the optimal 
choice for WTP thresholds greater than $NZ27,000 per HALY gained (PPP-adjusted 
$US 18,000). However, uncertainty remains around relative survival benefits, and 
weekly paclitaxel becomes cost ineffective versus docetaxel if it is assumed 
that the two regimens have equal effectiveness. Reduced uncertainty about the 
relative survival benefits may improve decision making for funding.

In 2011, intranasally administered live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was 
approved in the EU for prophylaxis of seasonal influenza in 2-17-year-old 
children. Our objective was to estimate the potential epidemiological impact and 
cost-effectiveness of an LAIV-based extension of the influenza vaccination 
programme to healthy children in Germany. An age-structured dynamic model of 
influenza transmission was developed and combined with a decision-tree to 
evaluate different vaccination strategies in the German health care system. 
Model inputs were based on published literature or were derived by expert 
consulting using the Delphi technique. Unit costs were drawn from German 
sources. Under base-case assumptions, annual routine vaccination of children 
aged 2-17 years with LAIV assuming an uptake of 50% would prevent, across all 
ages, 16 million cases of symptomatic influenza, over 600,000 cases of acute 
otitis media, nearly 130,000 cases of community-acquired pneumonia, nearly 1.7 
million prescriptions of antibiotics and over 165,000 hospitalisations over 10 
years. The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was <euro> 1,228 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained from a broad third-party payer perspective 
(including reimbursed direct costs and specific transfer payments), when 
compared with the current strategy of vaccinating primarily risk groups with the 
conventional trivalent inactivated vaccine. Inclusion of patient co-payments and 
indirect costs in terms of productivity losses resulted in discounted 10-year 
cost savings of <euro> 3.4 billion. In conclusion, adopting universal influenza 
immunisation of healthy children and adolescents would lead to a substantial 
reduction in influenza-associated disease at a reasonable cost to the German 
statutory health insurance system. On the basis of the epidemiological and 
health economic simulation results, a recommendation of introducing annual 
routine influenza vaccination of children 2-17 years of age might be taken into 
consideration.

INTRODUCTION: Thermal ablation techniques (radiofrequency-ablation/cryotherapy) 
can be indicated with a curative intent. The success rate and prognostic factors 
for complete treatment were analysed.
MATERIAL/METHODS: The medical records of all patients who had undergone 
curatively intended thermal ablation of bone metastases between September 2001 
and February 2012 were retrospectively analysed. The goal was to achieve 
complete treatment of all bone metastases in patients with oligometastatic 
disease (group 1) or only of bone metastases that could potentially lead to 
skeletal-related events in patients with a long life expectancy (group 2). We 
report the rate of complete treatment according to patient characteristics, 
primary tumour site, bone metastasis characteristics, radiofrequency 
ablation/cryotherapy and the treatment group (group 1/group 2).
RESULTS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients had undergone curatively intended 
thermal ablation of 122 bone metastases. The median follow-up was 22.8 months 
[IQR = 12.2-44.4]. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the 1-year complete 
treatment rate was 67% (95%CI: 50%-76%). In the multivariate analysis the 
favourable prognostic factors for complete local treatment were oligometastatic 
status (p = 0.02), metachronous (p = 0.004) and small-sized (p = 0.001) bone 
metastases, without cortical bone erosion (p = 0.01) or neurological structures 
in the vicinity (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Thermal ablation should be included in the therapeutic arsenal for 
the cure of bone metastases.
KEY POINTS: • Thermal ablation techniques are currently performed to palliate 
pain caused by bone metastases. • In selected patients, thermal ablation can 
also be indicated with a curative intent. • Oligometastatic and/or metachronous 
diseases are good prognostic factors for local success. • Small-size (<2 cm) 
bone metastases and no cortical erosion are good prognostic factors.

Anaplastic gliomas (AG) include 6-10% of all newly diagnoses of primary brain 
tumors. They have an unfavourable prognosis and, to date, there is not an 
established treatment universally recognized. Four recent randomized clinical 
trials were identified for a total of 1,170 patients (anaplastic-astrocytomas, 
anaplasticoligoastrocytoma, anaplastic-oligodendroglioma), in order to define 
the better sequence and timing of chemo-radiotherapy, Three studies compared 
radiotherapy (RT) treatment vs. radio-chemotherapy with 
procarbazine-lomustine-vincristine (PCV) or temozolomide (TMZ) or 
dibromodulcitol and bichloroethylnitrosurea (DBD/BCNU) and only one compared RT 
vs chemotherapy (CT) with PCV or TMZ. Results show no significant differences in 
terms of PFS/OS between RT/CT alone or combined treatment although a trend 
toward an improvement of OS was observed after RT + CT treatment (m-OS in RT + 
adjuvant PCV was 42.3 vs. 30.6 months in RT alone p=0.0003). Grade 3-4 
mielotoxicity has been observed in almost all cases of patients treated with PCV 
+ RT. None of four studies reviewed conducted a head to head comparison between 
PCV vs. TMZ. Only a study randomized patients to PCV/TMZ without however 
providing data in terms of PSF and OS between the two treatments. It found no 
significant differences in PFS from initial RT and adjuvant CT (PCV-TMZ) at 
progression compared to initial CT followed by RT at progression. The optimal 
treatment of AG should reasonably consider not only the histology as well as the 
molecular markers of the tumor, but also clinical conditions, age of patients, 
life expectancy, Karnofsky-performance-status and tumor resection to achieve in 
future the personalization of care.

INTRODUCTION: To be able to treat prolonged epileptic crises practical, safe and 
effective rescue medication is needed. Today, the standard treatment in 
community healthcare is rectal diazepam. The introduction of a buccal solution 
of midazolam opens up a new perspective in their treatment.
AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of buccal midazolam with respect to 
rectal diazepam for children diagnosed with epilepsy who present prolonged 
convulsive seizures in the community setting in Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study produces a model of its cost-effectiveness from 
the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (SNS), with the outcomes 
presented in terms of cost-quality adjusted life years. Data were collected from 
different sources, including estimations regarding the clinical effectiveness 
from a clinical trial, from a Delphi panel in Spain and from a national survey 
carried out on parents of children with epilepsy in order to determine the 
current practices.
RESULTS: Treatment with buccal midazolam produces a saving in costs in 
comparison to rectal diazepam. The amount saved by the Spanish SNS comes to 
5,484 euros per patient per year. Treatment with buccal midazolam offers an 
improved health-related quality of life. This, together with the savings in 
costs, means that there is a dominance of buccal midazolam over rectal diazepam 
in all the settings that have been examined.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained with the model show that buccal midazolam is 
more cost-effective than rectal diazepam due to a reduction in the need to call 
out ambulances and for stays in hospital, as well as an improved health-related 
quality of life.

con midazolam bucal ofrece una mejora en la calidad de vida relacionada con la 
salud. Esto, unido al ahorro de costes, hace que el midazolam bucal sea 
dominante frente al diacepam rectal en todos los escenarios examinados. 
Conclusion. Los resultados del modelo muestran que el midazolam bucal es mas 
coste-efectivo que el diacepam rectal debido a una reduccion en la necesidad de 
llamadas a la ambulancia y estancias en el hospital, asi como a una mejora en la 
calidad de vida relacionada con la salud.

INTRODUCTION: One of the goals of Quality Assurance in Radiotherapy (QART) is to 
reduce the variability and uncertainties related to treatment planning and beam 
delivery. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome impact and 
cost-effectiveness (CE) of various QART levels for a head and neck (H&N) cancer 
study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: QART levels were defined as: basic QART with a dummy run 
(level 2), level 2 plus prospective Individual Case Reviews (ICRs) for 15% of 
patients (level 3) and level 2 plus prospective ICRs for all patients (level 4). 
The follow-up of patients was modeled using a multi-state model with parameters 
derived from EORTC, TROG and RTOG prospective studies. Individual patient data, 
linking QART results with outcome, were retrieved from the TROG database. 
Results for each QART level were expressed as percentage of mortality and local 
failure at 5 years.
RESULTS: Quality-of-life-adjusted and recurrence-free survival increased with 
increasing QART levels. The increase of all these metrics was more sizeable with 
an increased QART level from 2 or 3 to 4. The estimated 
quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) for an increase of QART levels of 3-4 and 
2-4 were 0.09 and 0.15, respectively. The incremental CE ratio was €5525 and 
€3659 Euros per QALY for these QART levels. Compared to QART level 2 or 3, level 
4 was cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing QART levels resulted in better patient outcome in this 
simulated study. The increased complexity of the QART program was also 
cost-effective.

Head and neck squamous epithelial cell cancer (HNSCC), the world's fifth most 
common type of cancers, is associated with short life expectancy and high death 
rates if not detected in early stages. The aim of this study was to investigate 
hRRM1 and p53R2 gene polymorphisms by using real-time PCR technique in patients 
with head and neck cancer. In total, 87 patients with head and neck malignancies 
and 87 control group who have not any malignancies were included in the study 
between January 2011 and February 2012 in Istanbul University Faculty of 
Medicine Department of ORL. In the study, real-time PCR was used to detect hRRM1 
(rs12806698 C/A) and p53R2 (rs2290707 G/T) gene polymorphisms in Turkish HNSCC 
patients and healthy individuals. Genomic DNA isolation was performed according 
to the kit protocol with spin column. LightCycler 1.5 system was used to perform 
SNP genotyping using hybridization probes consisting of 3'-fluorescein and a 
5'-LightCycler Red labeled pair of oligonucleotide probes. There were 
significant differences in the distribution of hRRM1 genotypes. Frequency of 
individuals with hRRM1 AA genotype was higher in patients with less 
differentiation when compared with well differentiation [p 0.025, Fisher's exact 
test, odds ratio (OR) 0.140, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0.024-0.797]. It is 
observed that A allele carriers have nearly twofold risk for development of the 
disease (p = 0.022; χ (2) 5.24; OR 2.02, 95 % CI 1.10-3.72).

Longevity and its regulation: centenarians and beyond.

Robert L(1), Fulop T.

(1)Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Paris V University, Paris, France.

Regulation of longevity depends on genetic and environmental factors. According 
to Svanborg, a Swedish geriatrician, over the last decades human life expectancy 
increased as well as the age at onset of fatal diseases. Nevertheless, autopsies 
of centenarians revealed the presence of several severe pathologies which could 
have killed them much earlier. Therefore, the emphasis is on regulation of 
resistance dependent on the expression of genes such as Sirtuins, mTOR pathway 
and others controlling body resistance. Only a small fraction (<1%) of 
centenarians live to become supercentenarians (110 years), indicating a limit of 
performance and resistance of the body. This limit can be interpreted as 
'tinkering' of nature instead of producing masterpieces as suggested by F. 
Jacob. These facts and theories are described in this chapter.

Inbred mouse strains reveal biomarkers that are pro-longevity, antilongevity or 
role switching.

Traditionally, biomarkers of aging are classified as either pro-longevity or 
antilongevity. Using longitudinal data sets from the large-scale inbred mouse 
strain study at the Jackson Laboratory Nathan Shock Center, we describe a 
protocol to identify two kinds of biomarkers: those with prognostic implication 
for lifespan and those with longitudinal evidence. Our protocol also identifies 
biomarkers for which, at first sight, there is conflicting evidence. Conflict 
resolution is possible by postulating a role switch. In these cases, high 
biomarker values are, for example, antilongevity in early life and pro-longevity 
in later life. Role-switching biomarkers correspond to features that must, for 
example, be minimized early, but maximized later, for optimal longevity. The 
clear-cut pro-longevity biomarkers we found reflect anti-inflammatory, 
anti-immunosenescent or anti-anaemic mechanisms, whereas clear-cut antilongevity 
biomarkers reflect inflammatory mechanisms. Many highly significant blood 
biomarkers relate to immune system features, indicating a shift from adaptive to 
innate processes, whereas most role-switching biomarkers relate to blood serum 
features and whole-body phenotypes. Our biomarker classification approach is 
applicable to any combination of longitudinal studies with life expectancy data, 
and it provides insights beyond a simplified scheme of biomarkers for long or 
short lifespan.

Cost-effectiveness of the National Health Service Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm 
Screening Programme in England.

BACKGROUND: Implementation of the National Health Service abdominal aortic 
aneurysm (AAA) screening programme (NAAASP) for men aged 65 years began in 
England in 2009. An important element of the evidence base supporting its 
introduction was the economic modelling of the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
screening, which was based mainly on 4-year follow-up data from the Multicentre 
Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) randomized trial. Concern has been expressed 
about whether this conclusion of cost-effectiveness still holds, given the early 
performance parameters, particularly the lower prevalence of AAA observed in 
NAAASP.
METHODS: The existing published model was adjusted and updated to reflect the 
current best evidence. It was recalibrated to mirror the 10-year follow-up data 
from MASS; the main cost parameters were re-estimated to reflect current 
practice; and more robust estimates of AAA growth and rupture rates from recent 
meta-analyses were incorporated, as were key parameters as observed in NAAASP 
(attendance rates, AAA prevalence and size distributions).
RESULTS: The revised and updated model produced estimates of the long-term 
incremental cost-effectiveness of £5758 (95 per cent confidence interval £4285 
to £7410) per life-year gained, or £7370 (£5467 to £9443) per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained.
CONCLUSION: Although the updated parameters, particularly the increased costs 
and lower AAA prevalence, have increased the cost per QALY, the latest modelling 
provides evidence that AAA screening as now being implemented in England is 
still highly cost-effective.

CONTEXT: The Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC) is the first 
clinical trials cooperative for palliative care in the U.S.
OBJECTIVES: To describe barriers and strategies for recruitment during the 
inaugural PCRC clinical trial.
METHODS: The parent study was a multisite randomized controlled trial enrolling 
adults with life expectancy anticipated to be one to six months, randomized to 
discontinue statins (intervention) vs. to continue on statins (control). To 
study recruitment best practices, we conducted semistructured interviews with 18 
site principal investigators (PIs) and clinical research coordinators (CRCs) and 
reviewed recruitment rates. Interviews covered three topics: 1) successful 
strategies for recruitment, 2) barriers to recruitment, and 3) optimal roles of 
the PI and CRC.
RESULTS: All eligible site PIs and CRCs completed interviews and provided data
