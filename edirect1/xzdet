OBJECTIVE: We explore combinations of effectiveness and price under which a DMT 
is cost-effective.
METHODS: We used an open-source model to conduct two-way scenario analyses for 
both payer and societal perspectives, varying price, and treatment effect size 
simultaneously. The analysis generates costeffectiveness threshold prices over a 
potential range of DMT effectiveness in patients aged 65+ with mild cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer's disease in the US.
RESULTS: Under the willingness-to-pay a threshold of $150,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year and assuming 30% risk reduction relative to the 
standard of care, the maximum cost-effective price of a DMT per patient per year 
is ~$22,000 and ~$15,000 from societal and payer perspectives, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Joint variation of price and treatment effect size can help assess 
the cost-effectiveness of a potential Alzheimer's disease treatment.

BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza imposes a significant health and economic burden 
in South Africa, particularly in populations vulnerable to severe consequences 
of influenza. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of South Africa's 
seasonal influenza vaccination strategy, which involves vaccinating vulnerable 
populations with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) during routine 
facility visits. Vulnerable populations included in our analysis are persons 
aged ≥ 65 years; pregnant women; persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), persons 
of any age with underlying medical conditions (UMC) and children aged 
6-59 months.
METHOD: We employed the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Cost Effectiveness 
Tool for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (CETSIV), a decision tree model, to 
evaluate the 2018 seasonal influenza vaccination campaign from a public 
healthcare provider and societal perspective. CETSIV was populated with existing 
country-specific demographic, epidemiologic and coverage data to estimate 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) by comparing costs and benefits of 
the influenza vaccination programme to no vaccination.
RESULTS: The highest number of clinical events (influenza cases, outpatient 
visits, hospitalisation and deaths) were averted in PLWHA and persons with other 
UMCs. Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$ 3400 per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY), our findings suggest that the vaccination programme is 
cost-effective for all vulnerable populations except for children aged 
6-59 months. ICERs ranged from ~US$ 1 750 /QALY in PLWHA to ~US$ 7500/QALY in 
children. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the vaccination programme was 
cost-effective in pregnant women, PLWHA, persons with UMCs and persons 
aged ≥65 years in >80% of simulations. These findings were robust to changes in 
many model inputs but were most sensitive to uncertainty in estimates of 
influenza-associated illness burden.
CONCLUSION: South Africa's seasonal influenza vaccination strategy of 
opportunistically targeting vulnerable populations during routine visits is 
cost-effective. A budget impact analysis will be useful for supporting future 
expansions of the programme.

Today, under ideal conditions with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), 
HIV is a chronic illness with a normal life expectancy. As such, people with HIV 
are pursuing experiences that once escaped them, such as parenthood. One of the 
most important factors in reducing perinatal HIV transmission was, and still is, 
adequate planning. And pregnancy planning has a few additional implications for 
people affected by HIV, not unlike for people with other chronic illnesses. In 
2018, the updated Canadian HIV Pregnancy Planning Guidelines (CHPPGs) were 
published with 36 recommendations. To help pregnancy care providers use the 
CHPPGs in pregnancy planning counselling for people living with HIV and their 
partners, this paper summarizes 5 key considerations in the modern era of HIV 
management.

INTRODUCTION: Paediatric transplantation is the only curative therapeutic 
procedure for several end-stage rare diseases affecting different organs and 
body systems, causing altogether great impact in European children's health and 
quality of life. Transplanted children shift their primary disease to a chronic 
condition of immunosuppression to avoid rejection. Longer life expectancy in 
children poses a greater risk of prolonged and severe side effects related to 
long-term immunosuppressive (IS) disabilities and secondary cancer 
susceptibility. The goal remains to find the best combination of IS agents that 
optimises allograft survival by preventing acute rejection while limiting drug 
toxicities. This systematic review will aim to determine the optimal IS strategy 
within the so-called minimisation, conversion or withdrawal strategies.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the following databases with no language 
restrictions: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane 
Library, OvidSP Medline and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed 
Citations and Daily; OvidSP Embase Classic+Embase; Ebsco CINAHL Plus, complete 
database; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal. We 
will include controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials along with any 
prospective or retrospective study that includes a universal cohort (all 
participants from a centre/region/city over a certain period). Cases series and 
cross-sectional studies are excluded. Two review authors will independently 
assess the trial eligibility, risk of bias and extract appropriate data points. 
The outcomes included in this review are: patient survival, acute graft 
rejection, chronic graft rejection, diabetes, graft function, graft loss, 
chronic graft versus host disease, acute graft versus host disease, surgical 
complications, infusion complications, post-transplant lymphoproliferative 
disease, liver function, renal function, cognition, depression, health-related 
quality of life, hospitalisation, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, 
cancer-other, cancer-skin, cardiovascular disease, bacterial infection, 
Epstein-Barr infection, cytomegalovirus infection, other viral infections and 
growth.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing specific cargo molecules from the cell 
of origin are naturally secreted from bacteria. EVs play significant roles in 
protecting the bacterium, which can contribute to their survival in the presence 
of antibiotics. Herein, we isolated EVs from methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in an environment with or without stressor by 
adding ampicillin at a lower concentration than the minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC). We investigated whether EVs from MRSA under stress 
condition or normal condition could defend susceptible bacteria in the presence 
of several β-lactam antibiotics, and directly degrade the antibiotics. A 
comparative proteomic approach was carried out in both types of EVs to 
investigate β-lactam resistant determinants. The secretion of EVs from MRSA 
under antibiotic stressed conditions was increased by 22.4-fold compared with 
that of EVs without stress. Proteins related to the degradation of β-lactam 
antibiotics were abundant in EVs released from the stressed condition. Taken 
together, the present data reveal that EVs from MRSA play a crucial role in the 
survival of β-lactam susceptible bacteria by acting as the first line of defense 
against β-lactam antibiotics, and antibiotic stress leads to release EVs with 
high defense activity.

Symptomatic malignant pleural effusion is a common clinical problem. This 
condition is associated with very high mortality, with life expectancy ranging 
from 3 to 12 months. Studies are contributing evidence on an increasing number 
of therapeutic options (therapeutic thoracentesis, thoracoscopic pleurodesis or 
thoracic drainage, indwelling pleural catheter, surgery, or a combination of 
these therapies). Despite the availability of therapies, the management of 
malignant pleural effusion is challenging and is mainly focused on the relief of 
symptoms. The therapy to be administered needs to be designed on a case-by-case 
basis considering patient's preferences, life expectancy, tumour type, presence 
of a trapped lung, resources available, and experience of the treating team. At 
present, the management of malignant pleural effusion has evolved towards less 
invasive approaches based on ambulatory care. This approach spares the patient 
the discomfort caused by more invasive interventions and reduces the economic 
burden of the disease. A review was performed of the diagnosis and the different 
approaches to the management of malignant pleural effusion, with special 
emphasis on their indications, usefulness, cost-effectiveness, and 
complications. Further research is needed to shed light on the current matters 
of controversy and help establish a standardized, more effective management of 
this clinical problem.

BACKGROUND: Research efforts to measure the concept of healthy ageing have been 
diverse and limited to specific populations. This diversity limits the potential 
to compare healthy ageing across countries and/or populations. In this study, we 
developed a novel measurement scale of healthy ageing using worldwide cohorts.
METHODS: In the Ageing Trajectories of Health-Longitudinal Opportunities and 
Synergies (ATHLOS) project, data from 16 international cohorts were harmonized. 
Using ATHLOS data, an item response theory (IRT) model was used to develop a 
scale with 41 items related to health and functioning. Measurement heterogeneity 
due to intra-dataset specificities was detected, applying differential item 
functioning via a logistic regression framework. The model accounted for 
specificities in model parameters by introducing cohort-specific parameters that 
rescaled scores to the main scale, using an equating procedure. Final scores 
were estimated for all individuals and converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 
and a standard deviation of 10.
RESULTS: A common scale was created for 343 915 individuals above 18 years of 
age from 16 studies. The scale showed solid evidence of concurrent validity 
regarding various sociodemographic, life and health factors, and convergent 
validity with healthy life expectancy (r = 0.81) and gross domestic product 
(r = 0.58). Survival curves showed that the scale could also be predictive of 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The ATHLOS scale, due to its reliability and global 
representativeness, has the potential to contribute to worldwide research on 
healthy ageing.

This case report describes a nursing experience providing end-of-life care to a 
child with Niemann-Pick disease type C. The period of nursing care was from 
April to June 2018. After comprehensive nursing and family assessment, dyspnea 
and caregiver's role strain were identified as the primary nursing-care 
problems. Niemann-Pick is a rare disease caused by genomic abnormalities. 
Patients with this disease are unable to metabolize lipids, which accumulate in 
organs, causing hepatosplenomegaly, dyspnea, and central nervous system 
degeneration. There is a lack of relevant experience in medical and nursing care 
due to the small number of cases worldwide. It is difficult to predict the 
progress of this disease and the life expectancy of the patient. The complex 
indications of this disease complicate the caregiver burden and process of 
end-of-life care. Thus, the multi-disciplinary team integrated the discharge 
preparations, symptom control skills, and related resources to build consensus 
with the family. We provided nursing care continuously from hospital to home as 
well as improved quality of care and family cohesion and reduced caregiver load. 
We hope that sharing this experience provides a reference for discharge planning 
and end-of-life care for children with rare diseases.

The paper describes an autopsy case of congenital heart disease as a single 
ventricle with transposition of the great vessels in a woman who survived to the 
age of 58 years. Due to hemoconcentration that has compensated for chronic 
hypoxia, the woman received low-molecular-weight heparin, which was complicated 
by severe heparin-induced thrombocytopenia resulting in death from cerebral 
hemorrhage. The author is inclined to explain the unusual clinical course of the 
disease by the fact that despite the mixing of arterial and venous bloods, 
transposition of the great arteries in the patient must have been accompanied by 
the flow of the bulk of arterial blood into the aorta and venous blood into the 
pulmonary trunk.

Publisher: Приводится секционное наблюдение врожденного порока сердца в виде 
единого желудочка с транспозицией магистральных сосудов у женщины, дожившей до 
58 лет. В связи с гемоконцентрацией, компенсировавшей хроническую гипоксию, 
женщина получала низкомолекулярный гепарин, что осложнилось тяжелой 
гепарининдуцированной тромбоцитопенией, приведшей к смерти от кровоизлияния в 
головной мозг. Необычное клиническое течение заболевания автор склонен объяснить 
тем, что имевшаяся у больной транспозиция магистральных артерий, вероятно, 
несмотря на смешение артериальной и венозной крови, сопровождалась поступлением 
основной массы артериальной крови в аорту, а венозной — в легочный ствол.

TGF-β1 is involved in tumour growth. Four TGFB1 SNPs and TGF-β1 production by 
stimulated PBMC were determined in seventy-eight gastric adenocarcinoma 
patients. In addition, TGF-β1 levels were measured in the plasma of further 
thirty patients. rs1800471-G/C genotype was prevalent in patients (20.7%) 
compared to controls (8.4%), as it also was the rs1800468 SNP-G/A genotype in 
stage IV patients (20.7%) compared to stage I, II and III patients, combined 
(10.3%). Conversely, the T/T rs1800469 SNP-T/T genotype was absent in the former 
group and present in 19.0% in the latter. Furthermore, the 
rs1800469-C/rs1800470-T (CT) haplotype was found in 15.0% of stage IV patients 
as compared to 3.0% of the remaining patients (3.0%) and also identifies 
patients with worse five-year life expectancy (P = .03). TGF-β1 synthesis by 
stimulated PBMCs was significantly lower in patients with the risk SNPs or 
haplotype, compared to the alternative genotype. Finally, TGF-β1 plasma levels 
were lower in patients with worse life expectancy. Analysis of TGFB1 SNPs and 
measurement of plasma TGF-β1 levels serves to identify patients at risk of 
developing a more aggressive disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sleep and obesity share a bidirectional relationship, and 
weight loss has been shown to enhance sleep. Aiming to extend sleep on its own 
or as part of a lifestyle intervention may attenuate health consequences of 
short sleep. This review highlights several sleep extension approaches, 
discusses feasibility of each, and summarizes findings relevant to obesity.
RECENT FINDINGS: Sleep extension in response to experimental sleep restriction 
demonstrates partial rescue of cardiometabolic dysfunction in some but not all 
studies. Adequate sleep on a nightly basis may be necessary for optimal health. 
While initial sleep extension interventions in habitually short sleepers have 
been met with obstacles, preliminary findings suggest that sleep extension or 
sleep hygiene interventions may improve glycemic control, decrease blood 
pressure, and enhance weight loss. Sleep extension has the potential to 
attenuate obesity risk and cardiometabolic dysfunction. There is tremendous 
opportunity for future research that establishes a minimum threshold for sleep 
extension effectiveness and addresses logistical barriers identified in seminal 
studies.

The objective of this study is to describe how screen-preventable loss of life 
(screen-PLL) can be used to analyze the distribution of life savings with 
mammographic screening. The determination of screen-PLL with mammography is 
possible using a natural history model of breast cancer that simulates clinical 
and pathologic events of this disease. This investigation uses a Monte Carlo 
Markov model with data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
Program; American Cancer Society; and National Vital Statistics System. 
Populations of one million women per screening strategy are simulated over a 
lifetime with mammographic screening based on current guidelines of the American 
Cancer Society (ACS), United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), 
triennial screening from age 50-70, and no screening. Screen-PLL curves are 
generated and show guideline performance over a lifetime. The screen-PLL curve 
with no screening is determined by tumor discovery through clinical awareness 
and has the highest values of screen-PLL. The ACS and USPSTF strategies 
demonstrate screen-PLL curves favoring the elderly. The curve for triennial 
screening is more uniform than the ACS or USPSTF curves but could be improved by 
adding screen(s) at either end of the 50-70 age range. This study introduces the 
use of screen-PLL as a tool to improve the understanding of screening guidelines 
and allowing a more balanced allocation of life savings across an aging 
population. The method presented shows how screen-PLL can be used to analyze and 
potentially improve breast cancer screening guidelines.

Chemotherapy-free frontline therapy for CLL: is it worth it?

Department of Medicine at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Lake 
Success, NY.

The treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) embodies one of the great 
success stories in translational research, with the development of therapies 
aimed at disrupting crucial pathways that allow for the survival and 
proliferation of the malignant clone. The arrival of targeted agents into our 
armamentarium, along with the advent of novel monoclonal antibodies that can 
achieve deeper remissions, has steered the field to a new treatment paradigm. 
Given the panoply of therapeutic options available, the question arises whether 
chemotherapy still has a role in the management of CLL. The novel targeted 
agents, which include the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ibrutinib and 
acalabrutinib, along with the B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, are 
highly effective in achieving a response with improved remission duration and 
survival, particularly in high-risk patients. Despite this major progress, the 
new agents bring a unique set of toxicities unlike those associated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. There is a paucity of head-to-head comparisons among all 
of the novel agents, because their approval was based on randomization against 
traditional chemoimmunotherapeutic regimens. Parallel to the increase in the 
number of available targeted agents, there has been a significant improvement in 
quality of life and life expectancy of the patients with a CLL diagnosis over 
the last decade. Our review will examine whether "chemotherapy-free" frontline 
treatment approaches are worth the associated risks. Our goal is to help 
identify optimal treatment strategies tailored to the individual by reviewing 
available data on monotherapy vs combination strategies, depth of response, 
treatment duration, and potential toxicities.

Abnormal uterine bleeding in users of rivaroxaban and apixaban.

Children's Hospital/Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.

Up to two-thirds of menstruating women experience abnormal uterine bleeding 
(AUB) when treated with oral anticoagulants. However, the true prevalence of AUB 
for specific agents remains uncertain, as many of these episodes, while 
interfering significantly with quality of life and overall health, are not 
captured by definitions of major bleeding (MB) or clinically relevant nonmajor 
bleeding (CRNMB) used in clinical trials. A 2017 systematic review determined 
that women taking rivaroxaban, but not edoxaban or apixaban, had a twofold 
higher risk of AUB than women taking warfarin. Since then, new data have become 
available from extension trials, cancer-associated venous thromboembolism 
trials, pediatric trials, and a few observational studies specifically examining 
AUB as an outcome. Reported rates of uterine CRNMB were low (around 1%) and 
similar for rivaroxaban and apixaban in all these studies, and no episodes of 
uterine bleeding meeting MB criteria were reported. Rates of AUB not meeting MB 
or CRNMB criteria were much higher, affecting up to 50% of women on rivaroxaban. 
Only 1 such study included women on apixaban, and no AUB was reported. In 
pediatric trials, 19% of girls experienced menorrhagia when treated with 
rivaroxaban. In conclusion, rates of uterine MB and CRNMB were low in all 
studies, but rates of other types of AUB not meeting these criteria ranged from 
15.8% to 50%. We conclude that AUB is underreported due to the limitations of 
MB/CRNMB criteria despite its substantial impact on quality of life. We urge 
future investigators to include broader definitions of AUB to better capture the 
impact of this outcome in menstruating women treated with oral anticoagulants.

First-generation vs second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors: which is best 
at diagnosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia?

Oehler VG(1).

Author information:
(1)Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.

In 2020, for the great majority of patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML), life expectancy is unaffected by a diagnosis of CML because of 
the unparalleled efficacy of ABL-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in 
halting disease progression. A wealth of choices exist for first-line treatment 
selection, including the first-generation TKI imatinib and the second-generation 
TKIs bosutinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. How I select first-line therapy 
between first-generation and second-generation TKIs is discussed in the context 
of patient-specific CML disease risk, therapy-related risks, and treatment 
goals. Although rare, identifying patients with CML at higher risk for disease 
progression or resistance is important and influences first-line TKI selection. 
I review the impact of first-generation vs second-generation TKI selection on 
treatment response and outcomes; the ability to achieve, as well as the timing 
of, treatment-free remission; and the impact of specific TKIs on longer-term 
health.

Handling challenging questions in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia: 
when is it safe to stop tyrosine kinase inhibitors?

The paradigm for managing patients with chronic myeloid leukemia is evolving. In 
the recent past, restoring a normal life expectancy while patients are receiving 
never-ending targeted therapy with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors through 
prevention of progression to blast phase and mitigation of iatrogenic risks was 
considered the best achievable outcome. Now, long-term treatment-free remission 
with continued response off tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is recognized as 
the most optimal benefit of treatment. Indeed, numerous independent clinical 
trials provided solid proof that tyrosine kinase inhibitor discontinuation was 
feasible in patients with deep and sustained molecular responses. This article 
discusses when tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be safely stopped in clinical 
practice on the basis of the best and latest available evidence.

How to manage CML patients with comorbidities.

Cortes J(1).

Author information:
(1)Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA.

Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) often have comorbidities, at an 
incidence that might be higher than in the general population. Because of the 
favorable outcome of most patients with CML treated with tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), a greater number of comorbidities might be the most 
significant adverse feature for long-term survival. The presence of 
comorbidities may also affect the risk of developing adverse events with TKIs. 
This effect is perhaps best exemplified by the risk of developing 
arterio-occlusive events, which is greatest for patients who have other risk 
factors for such events, with the risk increasing with higher numbers of 
comorbidities. The coexistence of comorbidities in patients with CML not only 
may affect TKI selection but also demands close monitoring of the overall health 
condition of the patient to optimize safety and provide the opportunity for an 
optimal outcome to such patients. With optimal, holistic management of leukemia 
and all other conditions afflicting them, patients with CML and comorbidities 
may aim for a near-normal life expectancy, just as the more select patients 
enrolled in clinical trials now enjoy.

Comment in
    Curr Biol. 2021 Mar 8;31(5):R243-R246.

Sexual selection results in sex-specific characters like the conspicuously 
pigmented extension of the ventral tip of the caudal fin-the "sword"-in males of 
several species of Xiphophorus fishes. To uncover the genetic architecture 
underlying sword formation and to identify genes that are associated with its 
development, we characterized the sword transcriptional profile and combined it 
with genetic mapping approaches. Results showed that the male ornament of 
swordtails develops from a sexually non-dimorphic prepattern of transcription 
factors in the caudal fin. Among genes that constitute the exclusive sword 
transcriptome and are located in the genomic region associated with this trait 
we identify the potassium channel, Kcnh8, as a sword development gene. In 
addition to its neural function kcnh8 performs a known role in fin growth. These 
findings indicate that during evolution of swordtails a brain gene has been 
co-opted for an additional novel function in establishing a male ornament.

BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation has often been seen as a disability-specific service 
needed by only few of the population. Despite its individual and societal 
benefits, rehabilitation has not been prioritised in countries and is 
under-resourced. We present global, regional, and country data for the number of 
people who would benefit from rehabilitation at least once during the course of 
their disabling illness or injury.
METHODS: To estimate the need for rehabilitation, data from the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 were used to calculate the 
prevalence and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) of 25 diseases, 
impairments, or bespoke aggregations of sequelae that were selected as amenable 
to rehabilitation. All analyses were done at the country level and then 
aggregated to seven regions: World Bank high-income countries and the six WHO 
regions (ie, Africa, the Americas, Southeast Asia, Europe, Eastern 
Mediterranean, and Western Pacific).
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2019, 2·41 billion (95% uncertainty interval 2·34-2·50) 
individuals had conditions that would benefit from rehabilitation, contributing 
to 310 million [235-392] YLDs. This number had increased by 63% from 1990 to 
2019. Regionally, the Western Pacific had the highest need of rehabilitation 
services (610 million people [588-636] and 83 million YLDs [62-106]). The 
disease area that contributed most to prevalence was musculoskeletal disorders 
(1·71 billion people [1·68-1·80]), with low back pain being the most prevalent 
condition in 134 of the 204 countries analysed.
INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to produce a global 
estimate of the need for rehabilitation services and to show that at least one 
in every three people in the world needs rehabilitation at some point in the 
course of their illness or injury. This number counters the common view of 
rehabilitation as a service required by only few people. We argue that 
rehabilitation needs to be brought close to communities as an integral part of 
primary health care to reach more people in need.
