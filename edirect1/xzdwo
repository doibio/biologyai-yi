Objective: This study aims to analyze the disease burden of intellectual 
disability among Chinese children and adolescents aged 0-19 years in 2019 and 
its trends from 1990 to 2019. Methods: Data were gathered from the Global Burden 
of Disease study. The prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of 
intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents were compared 
with the global average by gender, age group, and severity of disability in 
2019. Joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the trends in the 
prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability among Chinese children and 
adolescents from 1990 to 2019. Results: The prevalence and YLDs of intellectual 
disability among Chinese children and adolescents in 2019 were 1 522.65 per 100 
000 (95%UI: 1 228.62 per 100 000-1 817.55 per 100 000) and 109.81 per 100 000 
(95%UI: 72.15 per 100 000-158.09 per 100 000), respectively, which were lower 
than the global average. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual 
disability in China were slightly higher than the global average. The average 
annual percent changes in the prevalence and YLDs of intellectual disability 
among Chinese children and adolescents were -0.23% (95%CI: -0.26%--0.21%, 
P<0.001) and 0.74% (95%CI: 0.66%-0.81%, P<0.001) from 1990 to 2019, 
respectively. The prevalence and YLDs of severe intellectual disability showed 
continuously increasing trends over the past 30 years. Conclusions: The disease 
burden of intellectual disability among Chinese children and adolescents was 
lower than the global average in 2019, but severe intellectual disability was 
higher than the global average. The prevalence of intellectual disability among 
Chinese children and adolescents showed an overall decrease, while YLDs showed 
an increasing trend from 1990 to 2019.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic declines in life expectancy in the United 
States were attributed to increased mortality rates in midlife adults across 
racial and ethnic groups, indicating a need for markers to identify individuals 
at risk for early mortality. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, lipid-bound 
vesicles capable of shuttling functional proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. 
Given their role as intercellular communicators and potential biomarkers of 
disease, we explored whether circulating EVs may be markers of mortality in a 
prospective, racially, and socioeconomically diverse middle-aged cohort. We 
isolated plasma EVs from 76 individuals (mean age = 59.6 years) who died within 
a 5 year period and 76 surviving individuals matched by age, race, and poverty 
status. There were no significant differences in EV concentration, size, or 
EV-associated mitochondrial DNA levels associated with mortality. We found that 
several EV-associated inflammatory proteins including CCL23, CSF-1, CXCL9, GDNF, 
MCP-1, STAMBP, and 4E-BP1 were significantly associated with mortality. IL-10RB 
and CDCP1 were more likely to be present in plasma EVs from deceased individuals 
than in their alive counterparts. We also report differences in EV-associated 
inflammatory proteins with poverty status, race, and sex. Our results suggest 
that plasma EV-associated inflammatory proteins are promising potential clinical 
biomarkers of mortality.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most common diseases affecting both axial and 
appendicular joints and the lead cause of disability worldwide. OA incidence is 
rising due to extended life expectancy and the increasing obesity epidemic. 
Several joint interventions are available to manage pain and joint function in 
patients with OA, most of these treatments being widely applied using 
intra-articular injections. In this chapter, we will describe the different 
joint interventions available for the management of pain in OA focusing on 
intra-articular injections, including discussion on the evidence regarding the 
efficacy of these treatments, based on the most recent systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses available. We also discuss the importance of imaging in guiding 
these treatments, including the different imaging modalities available for 
intra-articular injection guidance, their advantages, and disadvantages. 
Finally, we briefly discuss safety data and the consensus regarding the most 
used intra-articular treatments to manage pain in OA.

INTRODUCTION: The number of patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC) is expected to increase due to the long life expectancy 
of those with advanced disease who are also more commonly diagnosed today 
because of stage migration. Several compounds are available for treating these 
patients.
AREAS COVERED: We reviewed currently available treatments for mCRPC, their 
mechanism of action and resistance, and we explored possible predictors of 
treatment success useful to predict survival in mCRPC patients.
EXPERT OPINION: A combination of molecular, clinical, pathological, and imaging 
features is necessary to correctly estimate patients' risk of death. The 
combination of these biomarkers may allow clinicians to tailor treatments based 
on cancer history and patients' features. The search of predictive biomarkers 
remains an unmet medical need for most patients with mCRPC.

OBJECTIVE: This study has investigated the impact of healthcare expenditure on 
life expectancy and morbidity rates in the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations to analyse whether health expenditure remains a critical component of 
improving health status and to determine the threshold value at which health 
strategy becomes cost-effective from 2000 to 2019.
METHODS: The techniques employed include the Dynamic Panel Threshold model 
advanced by Seo et al. (2019) to implement Seo and Shin's (2016) proposed 
first-differenced generalised method of moments (GMM) estimation. Furthermore, 
the dynamic system GMM and Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) techniques were 
also employed for robustness check.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that healthcare expenditure raises life 
expectancy and lowers the crude death rate, infant mortality rate, and maternal 
mortality rate. Therefore, healthcare expenditure is increasing life expectancy 
and reducing crude death rate, infant mortality rate, and maternal mortality 
rate. However, when disaggregating the impact, that of public healthcare 
expenditure is higher than that of private except in the case of infant 
mortality rate where that of private is higher. In addition, it found that the 
threshold value at which health strategy becomes cost-effective, thus the amount 
which the countries should spend for health status improvement is at least 6% 
and above of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
CONCLUSION: Healthcare expenditure is raising life expectancy and lowering the 
morbidity rate of the countries. Furthermore, the cost-effective level of the 
country's healthcare expenditure as a proportion of GDP is 6% and above.

BACKGROUND: Gallbladder and biliary tract cancer (GBTC) has greatly damaged the 
health of patients and is accompanied by a dismal prognosis. The worldwide 
distribution of GBTC shows extensive variance and the updated data in China is 
lacking. This study was to determine the current status, trends, and predictions 
in the burden of GBTC over the past 30 years in China.
METHODS: This was a descriptive, epidemiological, secondary analysis of the 
Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study 2019 data. Data 
including incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of GBTC in China by year, age, and sex were assessed. Joinpoint 
regression analysis was conducted to evaluate trends of disease burden due to 
GBTC from 1990 to 2019. Nordpred age-period-cohort analysis was applied for the 
projection of mortality and incidence due to GBTC from 2019 to 2044.
RESULTS: Nationally, there were 38,634 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
27,350-46,512) new cases and 47,278 (95% UI: 32,889-57,229) patients due to 
GBTC, causing 34,462 (95% UI: 25,220-41,231) deaths, and 763,584 (95% UI: 
566,755-920,493) DALYs in 2019. Both cases and rates of burden owing to GBTC 
were heavier among males and at old age. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized 
rates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs of GBTC generally increased 
from 1990 to 2019, with average annual percentage change at 0.8% (95% 
confidential interval [CI]: 0.6-1.0%), 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.5%), 0.4% (95% CI: 
0.2-0.6%), and 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%), respectively. Even though the 
age-standardized incidence rate and age-standardized mortality rate in both 
sexes were predicted to decline gradually from 2019 to 2044, the number of new 
cases and deaths were expected to grow steadily.
CONCLUSIONS: GBTC is becoming a major health burden in China, particularly among 
males and older individuals. Given the aging population and increasing burden, 
effective strategies and measurements are urged to prevent or reduce the number 
of new cases and deaths of GBTC.

BACKGROUND: The quality of health care has a significant impact on both patients 
and the health system in terms of long-term costs and health consequences. This 
study focuses on determining the long-term cost-effectiveness in quality of 
diabetes care in two different settings (private/public) using longitudinal 
patient-level data in Iran.
METHODS: By extracting patients intermediate biomedical markers in 
under-treatment type 2 diabetes patients(T2DP) in a longitudinal retrospective 
study and by applying the localized UKPDS diabetes model, lifetime health 
outcomes including life expectancy, quality-adjusted Life expectancy (QALE) and 
direct medical costs of managing disease and related complications from a 
healthcare system perspective was predicted. Costs and utility decrements had 
derived on under-treatment T2DP from 7 private and 8 Public diabetes centers. We 
applied two steps sampling mehods to recruit the needed sample size (cluster and 
random sampling). To cope with first and second-order uncertainty, we used 
Monte-Carlo simulation and bootstrapping techniques. Both cost and utility 
variables were discounted by 3% in the base model.
RESULTS: In a 20-year time horizon, according to over 5 years of quality of care 
data, outcomes-driven in the private sector will be more effective and more 
costly (5.17 vs. 4.95 QALE and 15,385 vs. 8092). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $33,148.02 per QALE gained, which was higher 
than the national threshold.
CONCLUSION: Although quality of care in private diabetes centers resulted in a 
slight increase in the life expectancy in T2DM patients, it is associated with 
unfavorable costs, too. Private-sector in management of T2DM patients, compared 
with public (governmental) diabetic Centers, is unlikely to be cost-effective in 
Iran.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: We report on apoplexy of undiagnosed pituitary 
macroadenoma presenting as sudden onset bilateral sixth nerve palsy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old male patient presented with a complaint of 
sudden onset diplopia for one week associated with chronic headache for two 
years. On further investigations, isolated bilateral sixth cranial nerve palsy 
was found to cause diplopia in lateral gaze and at distance. Magnetic resonance 
imaging of the brain showed a well-defined lobulated mass of 19 × 22 × 24 mm in 
the sellar and suprasellar region with hemorrhage, compressing optic chiasma 
superiorly with extension into the superior cavernous sinus compartment on the 
left side. The neurosurgery team excised the tumour through an endoscopic 
endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Abducens nerve palsy recovered within one 
week.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: In our case diplopia due to bilateral sixth cranial nerve 
palsy was the first clinical presentation of hemorrhagic apoplexy of pituitary 
macroadenoma which is a potentially life-threatening condition. There was no 
other significant ocular symptoms. High index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis and 
multidisciplinary team management resulted into favourable outcome.
CONCLUSION: Sudden onset diplopia and isolated bilateral sixth nerve palsy 
should be added to the spectrum of clinical presentations of hemorrhagic 
apoplexy of previously undiagnosed pituitary macroadenoma.

OBJECTIVES: Therapy outcome measures (TOMs) in temporomandibular disorders 
(TMDs) have not been systematically evaluated. We systematically explored the 
main TOM assessment methods for TMD TOMs used in previous studies.
DESIGN: Scoping review.
DATA SOURCES: According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Review reporting guidelines, we 
systematically searched five key databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, 
Embase, Epistemonikos and ClinicalTrials) and thoroughly scanned relevant grey 
literature using Medical Subject Headings, Emtree and index terms.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We considered primary research papers published from 
January 2010 to December 2020 that included patients with TMD aged ≥18 years, 
diagnosed according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Four reviewers extracted general information and 
information on study design and setting, target, interventions, and outcome 
type.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two of the 3726 screened articles (3704 by 
search engines and 22 manually) were included. The TOMs analysed included pain 
(n=161 articles), maximal mouth opening (MMO) (91), jaw function (32), jaw 
movement (26), joint sound (16), quality of life (QOL) (15), depression/anxiety 
(14), oral QOL (10) or others (30). Evaluation periods were <4 weeks (111), <8 
weeks (62), <12 weeks (59), >12 weeks (75) or 'not mentioned' (12). Pain 
outcomes (229) included general pain (115), tenderness (45), pain during 
functioning (44), resting pain (16) and others (8). Pain outcome evaluation 
methods included Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 121), Numerical Rating Scale (21) 
and other methods (21). Pain outcome indicators were binary (10) or continuous 
(158); only five studies reported the least significant difference in treatment 
efficacy. MMO evaluation using painless methods (19) and jaw function evaluation 
using methods assessing mandibular movement range (23) were the most frequent.
CONCLUSIONS: TMD TOMs are diverse; the major outcomes were pain, MMO, jaw 
function and jaw movement. Most pain outcomes are evaluated by VAS Score 
changes.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on life expectancy 
in Chile categorised by rural and urban areas, and to correlate life expectancy 
changes with socioeconomic factors at the municipal level.
DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional demographic analysis using aggregated 
national all-cause death data stratified by year, sex and municipality during 
the period 2010-2020.
SETTING AND POPULATION: Chilean population by age, sex and municipality from 
2002 to 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stratified mortality rates using a Bayesian methodology. 
These were based on vital and demographic statistics from the national institute 
of statistics and department of vital statistics of ministry of health. With 
this, we assessed the unequal impact of the pandemic in 2020 on life expectancy 
across Chilean municipalities for males and females and analysed previous 
mortality trends since 2010.
RESULTS: Life expectancy declined for both males and females in 2020 compared 
with 2019. Urban areas were the most affected, with males losing 1.89 years and 
females 1.33 years. The strength of the decline in life expectancy correlated 
positively with indicators of social deprivation and poverty. Also, inequality 
in life expectancy between municipalities increased, largely due to excess 
mortality among the working-age population in socially disadvantaged 
municipalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Not only do people in poorer areas live shorter lives, they also 
have been substantially more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to 
increased population health inequalities. Quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on life expectancy provides a more comprehensive picture of the toll.

BACKGROUND: Long-term survival after surgery for severe aortic stenosis (AS) 
provides important information regarding the choice between surgical (SAVR) and 
transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement. This study investigated the 
long-term survival of AS patients with low or intermediate surgical risk who 
underwent SAVR or TAVR in our institution versus that of the Japanese general 
population.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2019, 1276 consecutive patients underwent SAVR or TAVR for 
severe AS. Among them, we retrospectively investigated those with low (n = 383) 
or intermediate (n = 137) surgical risk treated with SAVR and those with low 
(n = 86) or intermediate (n = 333) surgical risk treated with TAVR. Their 
post-intervention survival was compared with that of an age- and gender-matched 
Japanese general population.
RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival rate of SAVR for patients with low surgical 
risk (mean age, 72 ± 9 years) was not significantly different from that of the 
general population (90 % vs. 89 %, respectively; p = 0.58), whereas that of 
patients with intermediate surgical risk (77 ± 6 years) was significantly lower 
than that of the general population (77 % vs. 84 %, respectively; p = 0.03). 
After TAVR, the 5-year survival of patients with low (78 ± 8 years) or 
intermediate (83 ± 5 years) surgical risk was significantly lower than that of 
the general population (low risk, 64 % vs. 81 %, p < 0.01; intermediate risk, 
66 % vs. 71 %, respectively, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that long-term survival after SAVR for AS 
patients with low surgical risk was as good as that of the age- and 
gender-matched general population, while the long-term survival after SAVR for 
intermediate-risk or TAVR for low- or intermediate-risk patients was lower than 
that of the general population. These findings suggest that SAVR is an 
appropriate option for AS patients with low surgical risk and good life 
expectancy, especially in Japan, where the life expectancy is the longest 
worldwide.

Early detection and treatment of diseases through health checkups are effective 
in improving life expectancy. In this study, we compared the predictive ability 
for 5-year mortality between two machine learning-based models (gradient 
boosting decision tree [XGBoost] and neural network) and a conventional logistic 
regression model in 116,749 health checkup participants. We built prediction 
models using a training dataset consisting of 85,361 participants in 2008 and 
evaluated the models using a test dataset consisting of 31,388 participants from 
2009 to 2014. The predictive ability was evaluated by the values of the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the test dataset. The 
AUC values were 0.811 for XGBoost, 0.774 for neural network, and 0.772 for 
logistic regression models, indicating that the predictive ability of XGBoost 
was the highest. The importance rating of each explanatory variable was 
evaluated using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which were 
similar among these models. This study showed that the machine learning-based 
model has a higher predictive ability than the conventional logistic regression 
model and may be useful for risk assessment and health guidance for health 
checkup participants.

Each year, cancer claims the lives of around 10.0 million people worldwide. Food 
components have been shown to alter numerous intracellular signaling events that 
frequently go awry during carcinogenesis. Many studies suggest that dietary 
behaviors involving the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods, as well as 
caloric restriction, may play an important role in cancer prevention. Gene 
expression patterns, such as genetic polymorphisms, can influence the response 
to food components by altering their specific action on targets, as well as 
absorption, metabolism, and distribution, among other things. This review 
discusses two significant cancer prevention techniques: a vitamin-rich diet and 
caloric restriction. It also discusses the possible molecular interactions 
between the two dietary strategies and the first clues of a probable synergy 
that would come from combining caloric restriction with antioxidant use. Caloric 
restriction diets have positive effects on life expectancy and enable avoidance 
of age-related illnesses. As a result, this manuscript is based on the 
degenerative nature of cancer and intends to shed light on the biochemical 
features of not just calorie restriction but also vitamins. Both are thought to 
have an effect on oxidative stress, autophagy, and signaling pathways involved 
in energy metabolism and mitochondrial functions.

Condensed tannins the polyphenolic compounds that are widespread in plants have 
been proved to have antitumor potential. Here, we purified the bioactive 
condensed tannins from leaves of Ulmus pumila L. and explored their structural 
characteristics, antitumor effect on TFK-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells as well as 
the related potential mechanism. The UV-Vis, FT-IR spectroscopy, ESI-Full-MS, 
and thiolysis-HPLC-ESI-MS demonstrated that U. pumila condensed tannins (UCTs) 
consisted essentially of procyanidins with epicatechin as the main flavan-3-ol 
extension unit. The UCTs could significantly reduce the survival rate of human 
cholangiocarcinoma TFK-1, SK-CHA-1, and MZ-CHA-1 cells with the better 
inhibitory effect on TFK-1 cell proliferation. Flow cytometric assay showed that 
UCTs affected TFK-1 survival by G2/M phase arrest and inducing apoptosis in a 
dose-dependent manner. In addition, a total of 6592 differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs), consisting of 94 upregulated and 6498 downregulated DEGs, were 
identified between untreated and UCTs-treated TFK-1 cells using RNA-seq 
technology. Enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database revealed that these 
DEGs were closely associated with cell cycle and p53 apoptotic signaling 
pathways. Furthermore, qRT-PCR confirmed that treatment of UCTs to TFK-1 cells 
caused significant changes in the expression of cyclin E, cdc25 A, cytochrome c, 
caspase-3, and caspase-8. These results indicated that UCTs exhibited the growth 
inhibition effect on TFK-1 cells possibly via G2/M cell cycle arrest and 
activation of caspase-cascade to induce apoptosis, and had potential as an 
anti-cholangiocarcinoma drug for further development. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: 
Ulmus pumila L. as a valuable tree species has been widely used in fields of 
medicine and food. Condensed tannins, the polyphenolic compounds widespread in 
plants, have been proved to have antitumor potential and be safe to normal 
cells. In this study, the condensed tannins from leaves of U. pumila (UCTs) 
remarkably suppressed cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell viability possibly via G2/M 
cell cycle arrest and activation of caspase-cascade to induce apoptosis. The 
results provided evidence for the application of UCTs as a potential therapeutic 
drug for CCA tumor.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explore the effectiveness of trilaciclib and ALRN-6924 in 
the prevention of cancer chemotherapy-induced toxicity in older patients. New 
chemoprotective agents are necessary because age is the main risk factor for 
chemotherapy complications that account largely for the poorer outcome of cancer 
in the elderly. Trilaciclib and ALRN-6924 cause a reversible block of the 
proliferation of normal cells through cell cycle arrest (CCA). With this 
mechanism, they may prevent the toxicity of cycle-active cancer treatment 
including neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, mucositis, and 
alopecia.
RECENT FINDINGS: Myelopoietic growth factors may prevent neutropenia in the 
aged, but they may cause severe bone pain, may aggravate thrombocytopenia and 
anemia, and may cause myelodysplasia and acute leukemia as a late complication. 
The prevention of thrombocytopenia, anemia, mucositis, and alopecia is 
unsatisfactory at present. These complications may jeopardize the treatment 
outcome as they require a reduction of treatment dose/intensity and because many 
patients find the resulting symptoms intolerable. In three studies of patients 
with extensive disease small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), trilaciclib reduced the 
severity and duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as well as the need 
for blood transfusions. In addition, it produced a significant expansion of 
T-cell clones. Trilaciclib received FDA approval for the prevention of 
chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in patients with ES-SCLC. ALRN-6924 is 
currently studied in phase II study of ES-SCLC. In a phase IB of 38 patients, 
ALRN-6924 prevented myelosuppression to an extent comparable with trilaciclib. 
Both drugs proved as effective in patients 65 and older as they were in the 
younger ones. In an "ex vivo" study, ALRN-6924 protected the epithelial stem 
cells of hair follicles from taxanes and promised to prevent alopecia. The 
possibility that CCA of tumor cells may reduce the effectiveness of cycle-active 
chemotherapy is a major concern. For this reason, the use of trilaciclib, an 
inhibitor of CDK 4/6, should be limited to tumors with inactivated RB1, and the 
use of ALRN-6924, an inhibitor of P53, should be limited to tumors with 
inactivated P53. Chemotherapy-related toxicities limit dose intensity and 
contribute to significant morbidity and mortality in elderly cancer patients. 
Trilaciclib and ALRN-6924 are of particular interest to geriatric oncologists 
because of their novel mechanism of action. Ameliorating chemotherapy-induced 
toxicities holds the promise of transforming the practice of geriatric oncology 
by enabling chemotherapeutic regimens that are currently not feasible for this 
patient population. Specifically, these agents may prevent chemotherapy-induced 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, perhaps the most life-threatening 
complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy, thereby obviating the need for the use 
of rescue strategies such as hematopoietic growth factors. In addition, these 
agents offer the potential for broad tissue protection from other 
chemotherapy-related toxicities, including mucositis, diarrhea, and alopecia, 
which historically have been poorly managed. Importantly, by preventing a 
spectrum of chemotherapy-related toxicities, these agents may permit the 
administration of chemotherapy at full-dose intensity, prevent functional 
decline, and grant maintenance of resilience to older cancer patients. As a 
result, the successful prevention of chemotherapy-induced side effects may not 
only mitigate the costs of care but also improve patient outcomes and quality of 
life. Finally, chemoprotective strategies offer the opportunity to apply 
geriatric principles to clinical trials of cancer treatment. In particular, they 
may allow the testing of prolongation of "active life expectancy" as a major 
goal of clinical trials in elderly patients. They may also enable novel and more 
practical forms of clinical trials. By assessing the risk of 
chemotherapy-related toxicity with the Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for 
High Age Patients (CRASH) or the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG) 
instruments, these agents may permit researchers to utilize patients as their 
own controls and endorse the approval of supportive care drugs based upon the 
risk profile of individual patients.

Optimization of host performance in cattle may be achieved through programming 
of the rumen microbiome. Thus, understanding maternal influences on the 
development of the calf rumen microbiome is critical. We hypothesized that there 
exists a shared microbial profile between the cow and calf rumen microbiomes 
from birth through weaning. Specifically, our objective was to relate the calf's 
meconium and rumen fluid microbiomes in early life to that of the cow rumen 
fluid prior to parturition and at weaning. Rumen fluid was collected from 
multiparous Angus crossbred cows (n = 10) prior to parturition and at weaning. 
Immediately following the parturition, meconium and rumen fluid were collected 
from the calf. Rumen fluid was collected again from the calf on day 2, day 28, 
and at weaning. The rumen fluid microbial profile and subsequent volatile fatty 
acid (VFA) profile were characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing and gas liquid 
chromatography, respectively. Microbial data was analyzed using QIIME2 and the 
GLM procedure of SAS was used to analyze the VFA profile. Alpha diversity was 
similar in the early gut microbiome (meconium, rumen fluid at birth and day 2; q 
≥ 0.12) and between the cow and calf at weaning (q ≥ 0.06). Microbial 
composition, determined by beta diversity, differed in the early rumen 
microbiome (rumen fluid at birth, day 2, and day 28; q ≤ 0.04), and VFA profiles 
complimented these results. There were similarities in composition between 
meconium, rumen fluid at birth, and rumen fluid from the cow at weaning (q ≥ 
0.09). These data indicate successive development of the rumen microbiome and 
stabilization over time. Similarities between meconium and rumen fluid at birth 
potentially indicates in utero colonization of the calf gastrointestinal tract. 
Similarities in composition between the early calf rumen microbiome and the cow 
at weaning prompt an interesting comparison and area for future consideration in 
terms of identifying at what stage of gestation might colonization begin. 
Overall, this study provides insight into similarities between the cow and calf 
microbiomes and may be helpful in developing hypotheses for the pathway of 
colonization and programming potential in the early gut.

Plain Language Summary: Developmental programming has highlighted important 
influences of maternal factors on offspring development. Recent research 
indicates a programming potential of the rumen microbiome and understanding this 
role as well as how inoculation occurs may allow beef producers to optimize 
management practices of gestating cows such that offspring performance is 
improved via the rumen microbiome. To investigate this, rumen fluid samples were 
collected from mature cows immediately prior to calving, from their calf 
immediately after calving with a meconium sample, day 2, and day 28 as well as 
collected from both dam and calf at weaning. The rumen and meconium microbiome 
of the newborn calf were similar to each other as well as to the cow rumen 
microbiome at weaning, although not to the cow rumen microbiome immediately 
prior to calving. The shared microbiome of the early calf gut highlight a common 
source of inoculation. The similarities with the cow rumen at weaning could 
indicate initiation of colonization occurs early in gestation. Results indicate 
there are shared microbial properties between the cow and calf rumen microbiome. 
This further supports the opportunity to alter the calf rumen microbiome to 
improve productivity through the management of the cow during gestation.

BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is one of the most popular complementary and alternative 
treatments for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). There are many methods of acupuncture 
in the treatment of KOA, and the effects are different. According to our 
clinical observations and researches, it is found that manual acupuncture (MA), 
electro-acupuncture (EA), and warm acupuncture (WA) are used more frequently in 
the treatment of KOA, and the curative effects are satisfactory. However, there 
is currently a lack of efficacy comparison of efficacy between different 
acupuncture treatments, as well as a lack of standardized clinical research on 
the acupuncture treatment of KOA. Therefore, we will carry out a high-quality 
clinical randomized controlled trial to research the effect laws of MA, EA, and 
WA on KOA.
METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 200 eligible participants with KOA will be randomly 
assigned to group A, B, C, or D in a ratio of 1:1:1:1. Patients in group A will 
receive MA, while those in group B, group C, and group D will be treated with 
EA, WA, and sham acupuncture (SA), respectively. Patients will be treated with 
acupuncture once a day, 30 min per session, 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks. The 
primary outcome is the change of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at week 4. The secondary outcomes include WOMAC, 
visual analog scale (VAS), Arthritis Quality of Life Measurement Scale 
Simplified Scale (AIMS2-SF), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI), and Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. The evaluation will 
be performed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 respectively after 
randomization.
DISCUSSION: This is a randomized controlled trial. We will observe the clinical 
effect of MA, EA, and WA on KOA to research the effect laws of these three 
acupuncture treatments on KOA and set up standardized treatment programs for 
acupuncture for KOA.

BACKGROUND: Unlike subcutaneous lipomas, thoracic cavity lipomas are extremely 
rare and can develop to be quite large without causing any symptoms. However, 
managing massive lipoma that involves both chest cavities is usually 
challenging, especially when considering the approach for excision.
CASE: We report our experience of surgical management of a case of a 46-year-old 
male with huge intrathoracic lipoma that extends bilaterally and is known to be 
the largest of such kind. The tumor was resected successfully using median 
sternotomy. Histological analysis confirmed features of lipoma.
CONCLUSION: To remove a bilateral intrathoracic lipoma, various surgical 
approaches have been documented. In our experience, a median sternotomy allows 
better exposure, which aids in complete surgical extirpation resulting in the 
prevention of recurrence.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an important 
pathogen. Although tremendous effort has been made for the vaccine development, 
only modified live vaccines are widely used with arguably limited efficacy. Our 
previous study showed that the Fc-fused first four Ig-like domains of Sn 
(Sn4D-Fc) and the SRCR domains 5-9 of CD163 (SRCR59-Fc) can act as PRRSV soluble 
receptors (VSRs). In this study, we improved the VSR-based anti-PRRSV strategy 
by taming their Fc domains. Sequence alignment showed that the CH3 domain of pig 
IgG1 contained five putative amino acids involved in the interaction with the 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The M455L/N461S variant of SRCR59-Fc/Sn4D-Fc was 
created for the higher affinity of FcRn binding. Both rBac-SRCR59-lsFc/Sn4D-lsFc 
and rBac-SRCR59-Fc/Sn4D-Fc expressing the mutated or wild-type VSRs were 
generated for conceptual validation. Both immunofluorescence and Western 
blotting analysis showed that the two rBac vectors could express the encoded 
VSRs in cells with similar expression levels and anti-PRRSV effects. In the 
rBac-injected mice, the expression of SRCR59-lsFc/Sn4D-lsFc was significantly 
prolonged than that of SRCR59-Fc/Sn4D-Fc. Both plasma stability and serum 
half-life of the purified SRCR59-lsFc/Sn4D-lsFc were significantly improved than 
that of SRCR59-Fc/Sn4D-Fc. SRCR59-lsFc/Sn4D-lsFc-treated peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells showed significantly stronger cytotoxicity on PRRSV-infected 
primary alveolar macrophages than SRCR59-Fc/Sn4D-Fc-treated cells. For the first 
time, we demonstrated that both half-life and effector function of pig IgG 
Fc-fused proteins could be significantly improved by taming their CH3 domains. 
The rBac-SRCR59-lsFc/Sn4D-lsFc could be further developed as a novel anti-PRRSV 
reagent.
