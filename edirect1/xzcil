OBJECTIVES: To map out the Public Health Workforce (PHW) involved in successful 
public health interventions.
METHODS: We did a pilot assessment of human resources involved in successful 
interventions addressing public health challenges in the countries of 
South-Eastern Europe (SEE). High-level representatives of eight countries 
reported about success stories through the coaching by experts. During 
synthesizing qualitative data, experts applied triangulation by contacting 
additional sources of evidence and used the framework method in data analysis.
RESULTS: SEE countries tailored public health priorities towards social 
determinants, health equalities, and prevention of non-communicable diseases. A 
variety of organizations participated in achieving public health success. The 
same applies to the wide array of professions involved in the delivery of 
Essential Public Health Operations (EPHOs). Key enablers of the successful work 
of PHW were staff capacities, competences, interdisciplinary networking, 
productivity, and funding.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite diversity across countries, successful public health 
interventions have similar ingredients. Although PHW is aligned with the 
specific public health success, a productive interface between health and other 
sectors is crucial for rolling-out successful interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Currently, no universally accepted definition of extended 
half-life (EHL) recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) exists. Identifying the minimum 
half-life extension ratio required for a reduction in dosing frequency compared 
with standard rFVIII could enable a more practical approach to decisions around 
prophylaxis with EHL rFVIII.
AIM: To identify the half-life extension ratio required to decrease rFVIII 
dosing frequency by at least 1 day while maintaining the proportion of patients 
with plasma rFVIII levels above 1 IU/dL and without increasing the total weekly 
dose.
METHODS: A previously published population pharmacokinetic model for standard 
rFVIII was used to estimate the percentage of patients with factor VIII (FVIII) 
levels always >1 IU/dL using various benchmark regimens. Using modelling, dosing 
frequency was reduced while rFVIII half-life was extended until the percentage 
of patients with FVIII >1 IU/dL equalled that of the benchmark regimen.
RESULTS: Benchmark 3×/wk dosing totalling 100 IU/kg/wk of rFVIII resulted in 
56.6% of patients with FVIII levels always >1 IU/dL. With 2×/wk dosing, 
totalling 80 or 90 IU/kg/wk, half-life extensions required to maintain 56.6% of 
patients at FVIII levels >1 IU/dL were 1.30 and 1.26, respectively. A half-life 
extension ratio of 1.33 was required to change dosing from every 48 hours to 
every 72 hours (both at 105 IU/kg/wk) while maintaining 92.8% of patients with 
FVIII >1 IU/dL.
CONCLUSION: Based on this investigation, EHL rFVIII products should have a 
minimum half-life extension ratio of 1.3 to provide a reduction in dosing 
frequency from 3× to 2×/wk compared with standard rFVIII products while 
maintaining the same minimum FVIII trough level.

Using Alternaria longipes as tested phytopathogen, endophytic bacteria isolated 
from soybean nodules were selected to study antagonistic effects by 
confrontation and metabolic liquid culture methods. The inhibited hyphae were 
determined by microscopic observation, and the screened strains were 
characterized by cell culture, physiological and biochemical tests, 16S rDNA 
sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and inoculation trials in greenhouse. The 
results indicated that the seven of the endophytes exerted more than 42% 
inhibitory effects after the first and the second screening. These strains 
belonged to genus Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Sinorhizobium and Stenotrophomonas, 
respectively. Microscopic observation showed that the affected hyphae ends of A. 
longipes appear deformity of coralline branch, spherical expansions and so on. 
Antagonistic experiments with metabolites showed that the inhibition of 
endophytic bacteria against pathogenic fungus played an effective role mainly by 
bacteria producing extracellular substances. Confrontation tests suggested that 
endophytic Bacillus rapidly produced biofilm to effectively hinder the growth 
and extension of pathogen hyphae. Inoculation experiments showed that the 
disease index of treatment group was significantly lowered compared with the 
control, suggesting it could be utilized as a biological control resource 
inhibiting tobacco brown spot.

The lace bug, Corythucha marmorata (Uhler) is a newly introduced species in 
China. The biological characteristics, such as the life table, fecundity, 
population dynamics were studied under laboratory conditions, i.e., temperature 
(25±2) ℃, humidity (80±5) %, photoperiod L:D=14:10. The lace bugs were reared on 
the host plant Solidago canadensis. The morphological characteristics at 
different life stages, the longevity and adult fecundity were recorded and used 
to construct the life table. Results showed that the average length of immature 
stages was (14.88±1.45) d and the adult average life-span was (59.88±5.85) d, 
and the progeny per female was (87.2±17.8). The intrinsic rate of increase of C. 
marmorata (rm) was 0.05 per female per day, the finite rate of increase (d) was 
1.06, and the net reproductive rate (R0) was 11.88. The mean generation time (T) 
was 46.11 d, and the double population time was (t) 12.91 d. The population on 
reaching a stable age distribution comprised approximately 59.3% of immature 
stages, and 40.7% of the adult stage. It was suggested that C. marmorata might 
disperse quickly and pose a potential threat to agricultural production.

Caloric restriction (CR) is the most potent nonpharmacological intervention 
known to both protect against carcinogenesis and delay aging in laboratory 
animals. There is a growing number of anticarcinogens and CR mimetics that 
activate NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). We have previously shown that 
NQO1, an antioxidant enzyme that acts as an energy sensor through modulation of 
intracellular redox and metabolic state, is upregulated by CR. Here, we used 
NQO1-knockout (KO) mice to investigate the role of NQO1 in both the aging 
process and tumor susceptibility, specifically in the context of CR. We found 
that NQO1 is not essential for the beneficial effects of CR on glucose 
homeostasis, physical performance, metabolic flexibility, life-span extension, 
and (unlike our previously observation with Nrf2) chemical-induced 
tumorigenesis.

Transgender people report discrimination in access to health care that is 
associated with numerous poor health outcomes, including higher prevalence of 
HIV infection, substance use disorders, and suicide attempts. The field of 
obstetrics and gynecology is uniquely positioned to meet a wide range of health 
care needs for transgender people, and obstetrician-gynecologists can and ought 
to provide gender-affirming care for these patients. Despite growing evidence 
that gender-affirming care is both necessary and cost-effective, transgender 
patients continue to face barriers to securing insurance coverage, which 
prevents clinicians from practicing standards of care. The purpose of this 
article is to delineate the major barriers transgender patients face when 
seeking insurance reimbursement for services routinely available to cisgender 
(nontransgender) women.

Central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's 
disease, etc.) represent a growing public health issue, primarily due to the 
increased life expectancy and the aging population. The treatment of such 
disorders is notably elaborate and requires the delivery of therapeutics to the 
brain in appropriate amounts to elicit a pharmacological response. However, 
despite the major advances both in neuroscience and drug delivery research, the 
administration of drugs to the CNS still remains elusive. It is commonly 
accepted that effectiveness-related issues arise due to the inability of 
parenterally administered macromolecules to cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) 
in order to access the CNS, thus impeding their successful delivery to brain 
tissues. As a result, the direct Nose-to-Brain delivery has emerged as a 
powerful strategy to circumvent the BBB and deliver drugs to the brain. The 
present review article attempts to highlight the different experimental and 
computational approaches pursued so far to attain and enhance the direct 
delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain and shed some light on the 
underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of neurological 
disorders.

Outcomes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have been dramatically improved since 
the emergence of imatinib and the subsequent generation of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKI) in the early 2000s. Indeed, CML is now associated with 
near-normal life expectancy for the majority of patients, provided they adhere 
to lifelong TKI-based treatment. This paradigm, in which CML can be regarded as 
a chronic disease, has inherent consequences on the prevalence of the disease. 
Our objective was to study CML prevalence trend in the French population from 
1960 to 2060. We used a cohort component-based model to forecast the prevalence 
of CML using projections of the French population, the estimated incidence rates 
by age and sex, and various hypotheses on the year-specific relative survival. 
CML prevalence in France is estimated at 2.5 per 100,000 inhabitants before the 
1980s, with a progression up to 6 by 2002. Since 2002 this trend has increased 
further, with current and predicted prevalence reaching levels around 18 and 24 
per 100,000 in 2018 and 2030 respectively. CML prevalence reaches 30 per 100,000 
by 2050 when progression slows. Our simulations show that prevalence of CML is 
driven by both population aging and relative survival improvement. The grey area 
corresponds to the expected prevalence of CML.

BACKGROUND: Melasma is a common chronic focal hypermelanosis that affects 
photexposed areas as face, mainly in women at fertile age. It inflicts a 
significant impact in quality of life; nevertheless, quality of life scores 
(e.g. MELASQoL) are not strongly correlated with clinical severity (e.g. MASI) 
in facial melasma, suggesting that different factors can influence the 
perception of disease beyond the clinical extension or the intensity of 
pigmentation.
OBJECTIVES: To explore clinical and socio-demographic aspects that influences 
MELASQoL scores.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study enrolling 155 adults (>18 y.o.) with facial 
melasma. MELASQoL, MASI, clinical and demographic information were assessed. The 
associations among factors were explored by multivariable methods.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 39 (8) years, and 134 (86%) 
were females. The correlation (Spearman's rho) between MELASQoL and MASI was 
0.35 (P < 0.05). In a multivariate regression, MELASQoL score was associated (P 
≤ 0.05) to MASI score (β = 0.6), lower income (β = 6.8), be single (β = 4.2) and 
low education level (β = 5.0). At multiple correspondence analysis, MASI, sex, 
marriage, education and income were associated with MELASQoL, as well as MASI 
was associated to skin phototypes, income and education level.
CONCLUSION: The perception of life quality impairment in melasma is influenced 
by low scholarly, low family income, single marital status and greater clinical 
severity.

This study aimed to develop chitosan films incorporating natural antioxidants 
from peanut skin (EPS) and pink pepper residue (EPP) extracts, as well as to 
evaluate their effects on lipid oxidation, pH, color, and microbial counts of a 
restructured chicken product. EPS had higher phenolic content and antioxidant 
activity compared to EPP. When both extracts were applied to chicken meat and 
the chitosan films, there were no differences for color, pH and total mesophilic 
counts compared to control at the end of the storage period. For lipid oxidation 
(peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), both extracts 
proved to be as effective as butylated hydroxytoluene to maintain the oxidative 
stability of the chicken product. The microbial counts of psychrotrophic 
microorganisms were significantly lower for treatments with active films. 
Chitosan active films with residue extracts may maintain the quality of chicken 
products due to their antioxidant and antimicrobial potential.

BACKGROUND: Systemic chemotherapy has long been the standard of care for 
advanced bladder cancer, but its cost implications are poorly understood. The 
objective of this analysis was to estimate survival and health care costs for 
patients with stage IV bladder cancer who did or did not receive chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients 
identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database 
with a new primary diagnosis of stage IV bladder cancer between January 2007 and 
December 2011. Survival and health care visits and costs following the date of 
diagnosis were determined for treated and untreated patients. Costs were 
expressed in 2016 US dollars.
RESULTS: A total of 1215 patients were diagnosed with stage IV bladder cancer, 
of whom 411 (33.8%) were treated with chemotherapy and 804 (66.2%) were 
untreated. Median overall survival was 10 months longer for treated than for 
untreated patients: 13.2 (95% confidence interval, 12.3-14.1) months versus 3.2 
(95% confidence interval, 3.0-3.5) months. Treated patients had fewer 
per-patient-per-month (PPPM) health care visits than untreated patients (7.5 vs. 
10.2, P < .01) and lower total PPPM health care costs ($10,707 vs. $18,935). 
Overall mean total lifetime costs were greater for treated than for untreated 
patients ($139,893 vs. $66,829, P < .05), which was driven by an approximate 
4-fold increase in life expectancy for the treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Approximately two thirds of patients diagnosed with stage IV bladder 
cancer were not treated with systemic chemotherapy. Increasing the percentage of 
treated patients in this population could potentially extend overall survival 
while simultaneously lowering PPPM costs.

relation to police violence, we quantified the number and rate of years of life 
lost (YLLs) due to police violence by race/ethnicity and age in the USA, 
2015-2016.
METHODS: We used data on the number of deaths due to police violence from 'The 
Counted', a media-based source compiled by The Guardian. YLLs are the difference 
between an individual's age at death and their corresponding standard life 
expectancy at age of death.
RESULTS: There were 57 375 and 54 754 YLLs due to police violence in 2015 and 
2016, respectively. People of colour comprised 38.5% of the population, but 
51.5% of YLLs. YLLs were greatest among those aged 25-34 years, and the number 
of YLLs at younger ages was greater among people of colour than whites.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of YLLs due to police violence is substantial. YLLs 
highlight that police violence disproportionately impacts young people, and the 
young people affected are disproportionately people of colour. Framing police 
violence as an important cause of deaths among young adults provides another 
valuable lens to motivate prevention efforts.

The main limitation of bioprosthetic valves is their limited durability, which 
exposes the patient to the risk of aortic valve reintervention. Transcatheter 
aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is considered a reasonable alternative to 
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with intermediate or high 
surgical risk. TAVI is now rapidly expanding towards the lower risk populations. 
Although the results of midterm durability of the transcatheter bioprostheses 
are encouraging, their long-term durability remains largely unknown. The 
objective of this review article is to present the definition, mechanisms, 
incidence, outcome and management of structural valve deterioration of aortic 
bioprostheses with specific emphasis on TAVI. The structural valve deterioration 
can be categorised into three stages: stage 1: morphological abnormalities 
(fibrocalcific remodelling and tear) of bioprosthesis valve leaflets without 
hemodynamic valve deterioration; stage 2: morphological abnormalities and 
moderate hemodynamic deterioration (increase in gradient and/or new onset of 
transvalvular regurgitation); and stage 3: morphological abnormalities and 
severe hemodynamic deterioration. Several specifics inherent to the TAVI 
including valve oversizing, manipulation, delivery, positioning and deployment 
may cause injuries to the valve leaflets and increase leaflet mechanical stress, 
which may limit the long-term durability of transcatheter bioprostheses. The 
selection of the type of aortic valve replacement and bioprosthesis should thus 
take into account the ratio between the demonstrated durability of the 
bioprostheses versus the life expectancy of the patient. Pending the publication 
of robust data on long-term durability of transcatheter bioprostheses, it 
appears reasonable to select SAVR with a bioprosthesis model that has 
well-established long-term durability in patients with low surgical risk and 
long life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Poor psychosocial working conditions increase the likelihood of 
various types of morbidity and may substantially limit quality of life and 
possibilities to remain in paid work. To date, however, no studies to our 
knowledge have quantified the extent to which poor psychosocial working 
conditions reduce healthy or chronic disease-free life expectancy, which was the 
focus of this study.
METHODS: Data were derived from four cohorts with repeat data: the Finnish 
Public Sector Study (Finland), GAZEL (France), the Swedish Longitudinal 
Occupational Survey of Health (Sweden) and Whitehall II (UK). Healthy (in good 
self-rated health) life expectancy (HLE) and chronic disease-free (free from 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes) life 
expectancy (CDFLE) was calculated from age 50 to 75 based on 64 394 individuals 
with data on job strain (high demands in combination with low control) at 
baseline and health at baseline and follow-up.
RESULTS: Multistate life table models showed that job strain was consistently 
related to shorter HLE (overall 1.7 years difference). The difference in HLE was 
more pronounced among men (2.0 years compared with 1.5 years for women) and 
participants in lower occupational positions (2.5 years among low-grade men 
compared with 1.7 years among high-grade men). Similar differences in HLE, 
although smaller, were observed among those in intermediate or high occupational 
positions. Job strain was additionally associated with shorter CDFLE, although 
this association was weaker and somewhat inconsistent.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that individuals with job strain have a 
shorter health expectancy compared with those without job strain.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a central 
role in aging and a number of different disease states. Rapamycin, which 
suppresses activity of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), shows preclinical (and 
sometimes clinical) efficacy in a number of disease models. Among these are 
Lmna-/- mice, which serve as a mouse model for dystrophy-associated 
laminopathies. To confirm that elevated mTORC1 signaling is responsible for the 
pathology manifested in Lmna-/- mice and to decipher downstream genetic 
mechanisms underlying the benefits of rapamycin, we tested in Lmna-/- mice 
whether survival could be extended and disease pathology suppressed either by 
reduced levels of S6K1 or enhanced levels of 4E-BP1, two canonical mTORC1 
substrates. Global heterozygosity for S6K1 ubiquitously extended lifespan of 
Lmna-/- mice (Lmna-/-S6K1+/- mice). This life extension is due to improving 
muscle, but not heart or adipose, function, consistent with the observation that 
genetic ablation of S6K1 specifically in muscle tissue also extended survival of 
Lmna-/- mice. In contrast, whole-body overexpression of 4E-BP1 shortened the 
survival of Lmna-/- mice, likely by accelerating lipolysis. Thus, 
rapamycin-mediated lifespan extension in Lmna-/- mice is in part due to the 
improvement of skeletal muscle function and can be phenocopied by reduced S6K1 
activity, but not 4E-BP1 activation.

Two-stage designs are commonly used in phase II oncology trial to mitigate the 
risk of exposing patients to an inefficacious drug. Typically, the decision of 
moving into stage 2 enrollment is made based on response rate in stage 1 
patients; and trials are designed in the hypothesis testing framework. When the 
primary objective of a trial involves more than one efficacy endpoints it is 
desirable to extend the two-stage design to a setting that accommodates two 
hypotheses while controlling overall type I and II errors (α and β). In this 
manuscript, we propose a simple method of searching stopping boundaries of both 
hypotheses simultaneously that satisfy α and β constrains using binomial 
distribution. Several design characteristics of these selected boundaries are 
further examined in order to choose the most desirable design based on an 
objective function. Simulation is used to confirm the results. A trial design in 
metastatic breast cancer where both response rate and health-related quality of 
life are of interest is used as an example of the application of the proposed 
method. In conclusion, the proposed design is an extension of Simon Two-Stage 
Design. It can be applied to phase II oncology trials with two independent 
co-primary efficacy endpoints.

Life expectancy continues to extend, although frailty caused by loss of skeletal 
muscle mass continues unimpeded. Muscle atrophy caused by withdrawal of motor 
nerves is a feature of old age, as it is in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
in which skeletal muscle denervation results from motoneuron death. In ALS, 
direct links have been established between motoneuron death and altered 
nucleocytoplasmic transport, so we ask whether similar defects accompany 
motoneuron death in normal ageing. We used immunohistochemistry on mouse tissues 
to explore potential links between neuromuscular junction (NMJ) degeneration, 
motoneuron death and nucleocytoplasmic transport regulatory proteins. Old age 
brought neuromuscular degeneration, motoneuron loss and reductions in 
immunodetectable levels of key nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins in lumbar 
motoneurons. We then asked whether exercise inhibited these changes and found 
that active elderly mice experienced less motoneuron death, improved 
neuromuscular junction morphology and retention of key nucleocytoplasmic 
transport proteins in lumbar motoneurons. Our results suggest that emergent 
defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport may contribute to motoneuron death and 
age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, and that these defects may be reduced 
by exercise.

Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in impaired neurologic function that 
for many individuals is permanent and significantly impacts health, function, 
quality of life, and life expectancy. Many efforts have been taken to develop 
effective treatments for SCI; nevertheless, proven therapies targeting 
neurologic regeneration and functional recovery have been limited. Existing 
therapeutic approaches, including early surgery, strict blood pressure control, 
and consideration of treatment with steroids, remain debated and largely focus 
on mitigating secondary injury after the primary trauma has occurred. Today, 
there is more research being performed in SCI than ever before. Current clinical 
trials are exploring pharmacologic, cell-based, physiologic, and rehabilitation 
approaches to reduce secondary injury and also overcome barriers to 
neurorecovery. In the future, it is likely that tailored treatments combining 
many of these strategies will offer significant benefits for persons with SCI. 
This article aims to review key past, current and emerging neurologic and 
rehabilitation therapeutic approaches for adults with traumatic SCI.

BACKGROUND: Most economic evaluations of smoking cessation interventions have 
used cohort state-transition models. Discrete event simulations (DESs) have been 
proposed as a superior approach.
OBJECTIVE: We developed a state-transition model and a DES using the discretely 
integrated condition event (DICE) framework and compared the cost-effectiveness 
results. We performed scenario analysis using the DES to explore the impact of 
alternative assumptions.
METHODS: The models estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
for the intervention and comparator from the perspective of the UK National 
Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. The models 
considered five comorbidities: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial 
infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. The state-transition 
model used prevalence data, and the DES used incidence. The costs and utility 
inputs were the same between two models and consistent with those used in 
previous analyses for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
RESULTS: In the state-transition model, the intervention produced an additional 
0.16 QALYs at a cost of £540, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of £3438. The comparable DES scenario produced an ICER of £5577. The ICER 
for the DES increased to £18,354 when long-term relapse was included.
CONCLUSIONS: The model structures themselves did not influence smoking cessation 
cost-effectiveness results, but long-term assumptions did. When there is 
variation in long-term predictions between interventions, economic models need a 
structure that can reflect this.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the surgical techniques and mid-term efficacy of 
reconstruction for proximal femur with allograft-prosthetic composite (APC) .
METHODS: Fifteen patients who underwent uncemented APC reconstruction of 
proximal femur after bone tumor resection were retrospectively evaluated. Image 
and physical examinations were taken on the 1st,3rd,6th,9th and 12th month after 
surgery and every 6 months thereafter to assess union condition,greater 
trochanteric bone absorption and myodynamia of abductors. Musculoskeletal Tumor 
Society (MSTS) and Harris Hip Score (HHS) were utilized to evaluate the function 
of hip joint.
RESULTS: Seven male and eight female patients were included with average age of 
25.1 years(17-56 years) and average followup of 32.8 months(18-48 months). Four 
patients had giant cell tumor of the bone,3 patients had osteosarcoma,3 patients 
had chondrosarcoma,2 patients had malignant fibrous histiotoma,2 patients had 
osteoblastoma and 1 patient had Ewing sarcoma. Unions occurred in the 
allograft-host bone interfaces of all patients in the period of 5-9 months 
postoperatively. Bone absorption in the allograft-host bone 
interfaces,dislocation,hypersensitivity of the allograft and acetabulum abrasion 
were not observed,while there were no metastasis and tumor recurrence. Three 
patients had periprosthetic fractures intraoperatively and were well fixed with 
cerclage. Absorptions in the greater trochanteric happened to 6 patients. All 
patients had mean MSTS and HHS scores of 11.3 (7-15) and 47.3 (40.3-58.5) 
preoperatively and 26.1(24-29) and 80.1(66.2-92.7) postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Uncemented APC reconstruction is proper for young patients with long 
life expectancy and high demand of function that suffered from tumors of 
proximal femur.

Life expectancy at birth for the USA has not increased in recent years. This 
commentary assesses the impact of substance use on this phenomenon. Although 
crude mortality rates of the most important causes of death (such as 
cardiovascular diseases or cancer) have declined between 2010 and 2014, crude 
mortality rates of drug- and alcohol-induced causes of death have increased. 
Alcohol use, non-medical prescription drug use (especially prescription opioid 
use) and illicit drug use have likely played a crucial role in life expectancy 
trends of the past years. Importantly, the current mortality crisis due to 
substances is disproportionately borne in lower socio-economic strata. As such, 
policies should reduce this impact.

AIM: Metastases from colorectal cancer are poorly responsive to stereotactic 
ablative radiation therapy (SABR) due to intratumoral hypoxia. Intratumoral 
oxygenation is improved by administration of angiogenesis inhibitors. Thus, 
there could be a clinical synergistic effect of SABR with bevacizumab on 
metastases from colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
feasibility and efficacy of SABR after bevacizumab in lung oligometastases from 
colon cancer.
METHODS: The data of patients with lung metastases from colon cancer who 
underwent SABR were retrospectively evaluated according to the following 
inclusion criteria: number of metastases ≤3; lung oligometastases from colon 
cancer in patients who underwent SABR; patients receiving previous chemotherapy 
alone or in combination with bevacizumab; Karnofsky performance status >80; life 
expectancy >6 months; at least 6 months' follow-up after SABR; presence of KRAS 
mutation. The results were compared with those of a similar cohort of patients 
with irradiated lung lesions from colorectal cancer in whom bevacizumab was not 
previously administered.
RESULTS: A total of 40 lung metastases were analyzed. The complete response rate 
after SABR was higher in patients who had received bevacizumab than in those who 
had not (p = 0.04). Additionally, in the bevacizumab group, a higher rate of 
post-SABR complete response was observed in case of oligopersistent versus 
oligorecurrent metastases (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of lung oligometastases from colon cancer the 
present study attested the higher efficacy of SABR after bevacizumab 
administration. Further studies in this field of research are strongly 
advocated.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic factors (clinicalpathological 
characteristics and treatments) in patients with breast cancer and metastasis to 
central nervous system (CNS) as the first site of the disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Kaplan-Meier method and life tables were used to estimate 
overall survival time over a retrospective cohort of 125 breast cancer patients 
treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (INCan) during 2007-2015, who 
presented metastasis to the CNS as the first site of extension of the disease. 
The cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the prognosis factors.
RESULTS: The median overall survival time was 14.2 months (IC95%: 11.83-26.93). 
Patients with triple negative (TN), according to inmunohistochemistry analysis 
classification, had lower survival times (p=0.0004) and had a risk of dying two
