OBJECTIVE: To examine how communication about life expectancy is initiated in 
consultations about palliative chemotherapy, and what prognostic information is 
presented.
METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer (n=41) with a median life expectancy 
<1year and oncologists (n=6) and oncologists-in-training (n=7) meeting with them 
in consultations (n=62) to discuss palliative chemotherapy were included. 
Verbatim transcripts of audio-recorded consultations were analyzed using 
MAXqda10.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was addressed in 19 of 62 of the consultations. In all 
cases, patients took the initiative, most often through direct questions. 
Estimates were provided in 12 consultations in various formats: the likelihood 
of experiencing a significant event, point estimates or general time scales of 
"months to years", often with an emphasis on the "years". The indeterminacy of 
estimates was consistently stressed. Also their potential inadequacy was 
regularly addressed, often by describing beneficial prognostic predictors for 
the specific patient. Oncologists did not address the reliability or precision 
of estimates.
CONCLUSION: Oncologists did not initiate talk about life expectancy, they used 
different formats, emphasized the positive and stressed unpredictability, yet 
not ambiguity of estimates.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Prognostic communication should be part of the medical 
curriculum. Further research should address the effect of different formats of 
information provision.

Author information:
(1)Department of Vascular Surgery, Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major cause of death in the western world, and carotid 
endarterectomy has been shown to be effective in treating both symptomatic and 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Carotid stenting is a relatively new form of 
treatment for carotid stenosis and few studies have looked specifically at 
asymptomatic patients.
OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively examine short- and long-term results in the 
treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis with surgery or stenting.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of all patients with asymptomatic 
carotid stenosis treated by carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy in 
our department from 2006-2007. The primary endpoints were stroke, myocardial 
infarction, or death during the periprocedural period; or any ipsilateral 
stroke, restenosis, or death within 4 years after the procedure.
RESULTS: The study comprised 409 patients who were treated by either stenting or 
surgery. There was a low morbidity rate in both treatment groups with no 
significant difference in morbidity or mortality between the treatment groups in 
both in the short-term as well as long-term.
CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment methods have a low morbidity and mortality rate and 
should be considered for patients with few risk factors and a long life 
expectancy. Treatment method should be selected according to the patient's 
individual risk factors and imaging data.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the detection rate for 
clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) after multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging (mpMRI)/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion biopsy versus 
extended biopsy or saturation prostate biopsy (SPBx) in men enrolled on active 
surveillance (AS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2013 to January 2016, 100 men with very low-risk 
PCa were enrolled on AS. Eligible criteria were: life expectancy greater than 10 
years, cT1c, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) below 10 ng/ml, PSA density less 
than 0.20 ng/ml², three or fewer unilateral positive biopsy cores, Gleason score 
(GS) equal to 6 and greatest percentage of cancer in a core 50% or lower. All 
patients underwent 3.0 T pelvic mpMRI before confirmatory transperineal extended 
biopsy (20 cores) and SPBx (median 30 cores) combined with mpMRI/TRUS fusion 
targeted biopsy (median four cores) of suspicious lesions [Prostate Imaging 
Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3-5]. Clinically significant PCa was defined 
as the presence of at least one core with a GS of 4 or higher.
RESULTS: After confirmatory biopsy, 16 out of 60 (26.6%) patients showed 
significant PCa. Targeted biopsy of PI-RADS 4-5 versus PI-RADS 3-5 lesions 
diagnosed six out of 16 (37.5%) and 12 out of 16 (87.5%) significant PCa, 
respectively, with two false positives (5%). The detection rate for significant 
PCa was equal to 68.8% on mpMRI/TRUS fusion biopsy, 75% on extended biopsy and 
100% on SPBx. mpMRI/TRUS targeted biopsy and extended biopsy missed five out of 
16 (31.2%) and four out of 16 (25%) PCa, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although mpMRI may improve the diagnosis of significant PCa in men 
under AS, SPBx had a higher detection rate for clinically significant PCa.

People with serious mental illness (SMI) are at risk of dying many years earlier 
than the general population. Providing an effective, cost-efficient healthcare 
service requires a holistic approach, and improving the physical health of 
people with SMI should be integral to all healthcare roles. It is important for 
nurses to identify and understand the barriers that people with SMI may 
experience when accessing physical healthcare. A range of factors contribute to 
reduced life expectancy, including lifestyle factors, symptoms of mental illness 
and the side effects of medications. This article discusses four areas of health 
that commonly affect people with SMI: metabolic syndrome, smoking, oral health 
and sexual health. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors that increase 
an individual's risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Smoking is increasingly prevalent in people with SMI, with rates 
remaining steady despite a decline in smoking rates nationally. Oral health and 
sexual health can negatively affect the physical health and well-being of people 
with SMI; however, these aspects of health are often neglected. This article 
identifies ways that nurses in all practice settings can use health promotion, 
assessment and treatment to improve the physical health of people with SMI in 
relation to these four areas.

Role of nurses in supporting patients to self-manage chronic conditions.

Coates V(1).

Author information:
(1)Ulster University and Western Health and Social Care Trust, Londonderry, 
Northern Ireland.

The burden of chronic illness is increasing globally as a result of increased 
life expectancy, unhealthy lifestyles, and advances in medical interventions and 
treatments. Therefore, people living with chronic conditions, and their 
families, will have to assume greater responsibility in managing such 
conditions. However, to do so they require appropriate support from healthcare 
services. This article explores some of the tensions that hinder the 
self-management of chronic conditions. It emphasises the importance of 
individuals and their families having the desire, and being enabled, to assume 
an active and decisive role in the management of chronic conditions. Nurses have 
a role in enabling patients to optimise their self-management skills, but 
organisational constraints in healthcare services, as well as constraints in 
nurse training and nursing roles, may mean that nurses are unable to fulfil this 
role. This article considers some of the factors that may limit the development 
of patient and nursing roles in relation to self-management of chronic 
conditions.

Population decline in a Philippine Negrito hunter-gatherer society.

Headland TN(1).

Author information:
(1)Summer Institute of Linguistics, Dallas, Texas75236.

The Casiguran Agta constitute a Negrito hunter-gatherer society in northeastern 
Luzon. The hypothesis presented is that this population has suffered serious 
decline over the last half -century. Demographic data collected over a 24-year 
period are used to substantiate this hypothesis. Agta figures on crude death 
rate, rate of natural decrease, infant mortality, life expectancy at birth, and 
homicide are among the most extreme known for any human population. Reasons for 
this decline are described, with emphasis on the factor of homicide.

Cause-specific mortality, life expectancy, and debilitation in aging 
polynesians.

School, Chicago, Illinois 60611.

Between 1950 and 1980 life expectancy among middle-aged American Samoan men 
increased 22%; among women it increased 36%. The largest proportional increase 
were observed after age 65% Men 29%, women 118%. This study examined whether 
increasing longevity health of older Samoans. Cause-specific mortality data were 
used to calculate multiple decrement life tables for American Samoa by decades 
for both sexes from 1950 to 1979. Changes in two life table parameters were 
examined: The probability of dying from, and the remaining life expectancy among 
persons who would eventually die from, pneumonia/influenza, infections, cancer, 
or cardiovascular disease (CVD) after birth and after age 45. Pneumonia and 
infections may indicate frailty or delibitration in older individuals. The 
probability of dying from a specific cause after a particular age reflects its 
relative importance for survivors to that age. Residual life expectancy 
indicates whether older individuals are succumbing at earlier ages or surviving 
longer the risks of death from specific causes. Trends in the probability of 
dying from, and life expectancy among those ultimately dying from, pneumonia and 
infections did not suggest improved survival of debilitated individuals. Rather, 
they indicated that older Samoans may have had greater average resistance to 
pneumonia and infections in later cohorts. How much this was related to improved 
medical care and availability was not clear from the available data. However, 
Samoans who died from CVD and cancer did not survive longer than their 
counterparts had in earlier decades. Thus, there was little opportunity for an 
increase in debilitation among aging Samoans due to the longer-term survival of 
the chronically ill.

The Narrow Road to the Deep Past: In Search of the Chemistry of the Origin of 
Life.

The sequence of events that gave rise to the first life on our planet took place 
in the Earth's deep past, seemingly forever beyond our reach. Perhaps for that 
very reason the idea of reconstructing our ancient story is tantalizing, almost 
irresistible. Understanding the processes that led to synthesis of the chemical 
building blocks of biology and the ways in which these molecules self-assembled 
into cells that could grow, divide and evolve, nurtured by a rich and complex 
environment, seems at times insurmountably difficult. And yet, to my own 
surprise, simple experiments have revealed robust processes that could have 
driven the growth and division of primitive cell membranes. The nonenzymatic 
replication of RNA is more complicated and less well understood, but here too 
significant progress has come from surprising developments. Even our efforts to 
combine replicating compartments and genetic materials into a full protocell 
model have moved forward in unexpected ways. Fortunately, many challenges remain 
before we will be close to a full understanding of the origin of life, so the 
future of research in this field is brighter than ever!

The article provides information on the mean age of death (MAD) those 
professionally involved in literary work (22 028 men and women 4 651) assigned 
to one of three categories: novelists, poets and writers-poets. Women any of the 
investigated categories authentically lived longer than men (p<0,02). Analysis 
of dynamics of mean age of death (MAD), starting from the 15th century BC to the 
end of the 20th century, showed that this ratio gradually increased but uneven 
among fiction writers and novelists, poets of both sexes, however, remained 
unchanged at poets and poetesses have declined. Among men the very old (90+ 
years) were 5,38 % and 3,01 % writers-poets, whereas among women - 12,35 and 
8,96 %, respectively. Centenarians have surpassed 1,62 % of women novelists and 
0,61 % poets, then among men - 0,31 % and 0,49 % of writers, novelists and 
poets, respectively. The frequency of violent deaths (homicide, suicide, 
accidents) is also varied and was highest among poets, novelists, poets have 
minimum-novelists occupied an intermediate position for these indicators. 
Histogram of MAD had 2 peakes type, characteristic for heterogeneous 
populations, with a sample of «writers» heterogeneity was weakly expressed, 
however in a sample of «poets» was very noticeable. Suggests that MAD, 
longevity, as well as the frequency of violent deaths are related to processes 
associated with creativity.

Publisher: В статье представлены сведения о среднем возрасте смерти (CВC) у 26 
679 лиц, профессионально занимавшихся литературным трудом (22 028 мужчин и 4 651 
женщина), отнесенных к одной из трёх категорий — прозаики, поэты и 
прозаики-поэты. Женщины любой из исследованных категорий жили достоверно дольше 
мужчин (p<0,02). Анализ динамики СВС, начиная с XV в. н. э. и до конца ХХ в., 
показал, что этот показатель постепенно, но неравномерно увеличивался у 
прозаиков и прозаиков-поэтов обоего пола, однако оставался неизменным у поэтов и 
снижался у поэтесс. Среди мужчин долгожителями (90+ лет) были 5,38 % прозаиков и 
3,01 % поэтов, тогда как среди женщин — 12,35 и 8,96 %, соответственно. 
Столетний рубеж перешагнули 1,62 % женщин-прозаиков и 0,61 % поэтесс, тогда как 
среди мужчин — 0,31 % прозаиков и 0,49 % прозаиков-поэтов. Частота 
насильственных смертей (убийства, самоубийства, несчастные случаи) также 
различалась и была максимальной у поэтов, минимальной у прозаиков, 
поэты-прозаики занимали по этим показателям промежуточное положение. Гистограммы 
СВС имели двухмодовый тип, характерный для гетерогенных выборок, при этом в 
выборке «прозаики» гетерогенность была выражена слабо, а в выборке «поэты» 
—весьма заметно. Высказывается предположение о том, что СВС, долгожительство, а 
также частота насильственных смертей имеют отношение к процессам, связанным с 
творчеством.

Numerous and often contradictory research results specify that the mechanism of 
increased susceptibility to diseases in old age has no satisfactory explanation 
so far. Together with it in literature almost completely there are no 
comparative data on features of surgery and injury influence on a structure and 
functions of lymphoid organs at patients of different age groups. However, lymph 
nodes are a marker of activity of inflammatory process in the region, on their 
changes it is possible to estimate precisely productivity of different medical 
actions, to predict development of many complications, and, thus, successfully 
to take actions for their prophylaxis. All this is especially important and 
actual because of constant increase in average age, in life expectancy of human 
population and strengthening of surgical activity at patients of advanced and 
old age.

Publisher: Многочисленные и часто противоречивые результаты исследований 
указывают на то, что механизм повышенной восприимчивости к болезням в старости

литературе практически полностью отсутствуют сравнительные данные об 
особенностях влияния хирургических операций и травм на состояние лимфоидных 
органов у больных разных возрастных групп. Однако именно лимфатические узлы 
являются маркером выраженности воспалительного процесса в регионе, по их 
изменениям можно точно оценивать результативность тех или иных лечебных мер, 
предсказывать развитие многих осложнений, а значит, и успешно принимать меры по 
их профилактике. Все это особенно важно и актуально в свете постоянного 
увеличения среднего возраста населения, увеличения продолжительности жизни 
человеческой популяции и усиления хирургической активности у больных пожилого и

The article tells about one of the actual problem of the provision of medical 
and social care for elderly and old aged people, through the organization of 
nursing care beds in the Voronezh region. Since the beginning of 2014 there were 
organized 320 such beds in 27 medical organizations of the region. Regular 
surveys of patients and their relatives, as well as personnel involved in the 
care service, made it possible to make the necessary adjustments and the further 
expansion of services in other hospitals. Thus the end of 2014 the number of 
nursing beds has been increased to 525, so more than a thousand patients have 
received the necessary nursing care.

Potential support ratios: Cohort versus period perspectives.

Kjærgaard S(1), Canudas-Romo V(1).

Author information:
(1)a University of Southern Denmark.

The 'prospective potential support ratio' has been proposed by researchers as a 
measure that accurately quantifies the burden of ageing, by identifying the 
fraction of a population that has passed a certain measure of longevity, for 
example, 17 years of life expectancy. Nevertheless, the prospective potential 
support ratio usually focuses on the current mortality schedule, or period life 
expectancy. Instead, in this paper we look at the actual mortality experienced 
by cohorts in a population, using cohort life tables. We analyse differences 
between the two perspectives using mortality models, historical data, and 
forecasted data. Cohort life expectancy takes future mortality improvements into 
account, unlike period life expectancy, leading to a higher prospective 
potential support ratio. Our results indicate that using cohort instead of 
period life expectancy returns around 0.5 extra younger people per older person 
among the analysed countries. We discuss the policy implications implied by our 
cohort measures.

BACKGROUND: In North America, tuberculosis incidence is now very low and risk to 
healthcare workers has fallen. Indeed, recent cohort data question routine 
annual tuberculosis screening in this context. We compared the 
cost-effectiveness of three potential strategies for ongoing screening of North 
American healthcare workers at risk of exposure. The analysis did not evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of screening at hiring, and considered only workers with 
negative baseline tests.
METHODS: A decision analysis model simulated a hypothetical cohort of 1000 
workers following negative baseline tests, considering duties, tuberculosis 
exposure, testing and treatment. Two tests were modelled, the tuberculin skin 
test (TST) and QuantiFERON®-TB-Gold In-Tube (QFT). Three screening strategies 
were compared: (1) annual screening, where workers were tested yearly; (2) 
targeted screening, where workers with high-risk duties (e.g. respiratory 
therapy) were tested yearly and other workers only after recognised exposure; 
and (3) post exposure-only screening, where all workers were tested only after 
recognised exposure. Workers with high-risk duties had 1% annual risk of 
infection, while workers with standard patient care duties had 0.3%. In an 
alternate higher-risk scenario, the corresponding annual risks of infection were 
3% and 1%, respectively. We projected costs, morbidity, quality-adjusted 
survival and mortality over 20 years after hiring. The analysis used the 
healthcare system perspective and a 3% annual discount rate.
RESULTS: Over 20 years, annual screening with TST yielded an expected 2.68 
active tuberculosis cases/1000 workers, versus 2.83 for targeted screening and 
3.03 for post-exposure screening only. In all cases, annual screening was 
associated with poorer quality-adjusted survival, i.e. lost quality-adjusted 
life years, compared to targeted or post-exposure screening only. The annual TST 
screening strategy yielded an incremental cost estimate of $1,717,539 per 
additional case prevented versus targeted TST screening, which in turn cost an 
incremental $426,678 per additional case prevented versus post-exposure TST 
screening only. With the alternate "higher-risk" scenario, the annual TST 
strategy cost an estimated $426,678 per additional case prevented versus the 
targeted TST strategy, which cost an estimated $52,552 per additional case 
prevented versus post-exposure TST screening only. In all cases, QFT was more 
expensive than TST, with no or limited added benefit. Sensitivity analysis 
suggested that, even with limited exposure recognition, annual screening was 
poorly cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: For most North American healthcare workers, annual tuberculosis 
screening appears poorly cost-effective. Reconsideration of screening practices 
is warranted.

AIM: Identify injury-related, patient-reported and treatment-related prognostic 
factors for 5-year outcomes in acutely ACL-ruptured individuals managed with 
early reconstruction plus exercise therapy, exercise therapy plus delayed 
reconstruction or exercise therapy alone.
METHODS: Exploratory analysis of the Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament, 
Nonsurgical versus Surgical Treatment (KANON) trial (ISRCTN84752559). 
Relationships between prognostic factors (baseline cartilage, meniscus and 
osteochondral damage, baseline extension deficit, baseline patient-reported 
outcomes, number of rehabilitation visits, graft/contralateral ACL rupture, 
non-ACL surgery and ACL treatment strategy) and 5-year Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain, symptoms, sport/recreation and quality 
of life (QOL) scores were explored using multivariable linear regression. 
Estimates were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, preinjury activity level, 
education and smoking.
RESULTS: For all participants (n=118), graft/contralateral ACL rupture, non-ACL 
surgery and worse baseline 36-item Short-Form Mental Component Scores were 
associated with worse outcomes. Treatment with exercise therapy alone was a 
prognostic factor for less knee symptoms compared with early reconstruction plus 
exercise therapy (regression coefficient 10.1, 95% CI 2.3 to 17.9). Baseline 
meniscus lesion was associated with worse sport/recreation function (-14.4, 
95% CI -27.6 to -1.3) and osteochondral lesions were associated with worse QOL 
(-12.3, 95% CI -24.3 to -0.4) following early reconstruction plus exercise 
therapy. In the same group, undergoing additional non-ACL surgery and worse 
baseline KOOS scores were prognostic for worse outcome on all KOOS subscales. 
Following delayed reconstruction, baseline meniscus damage was a prognostic 
factor for less pain (14.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 27.9). Following exercise therapy 
alone, undergoing non-ACL surgery was prognostic for worse pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-dependent differences in prognostic factors for 5-year 
outcomes may support individualised treatment after acute ACL rupture in young 
active individuals.

Modeling lifetime costs and health outcomes attributable to secondhand smoke 
exposure at home among Korean adult women.

PURPOSE: The aim of this research is to estimate lifetime costs and health 
consequences for Korean adult women who were exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) 
at home.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project the lifetime healthcare costs 
and health outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of Korean women who are 40 years 
old and were married to current smokers. The Korean epidemiological data were 
used to reflect the natural history of SHS-exposed and non-exposed women. The 
direct healthcare costs (in 2014 US dollars) and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were annually discounted at 5% to reflect time preference. The time 
horizon of the analysis was lifetime and the cycle length was 1 year. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In the absence of SHS exposure, Korean women will live 41.32 years or 
34.56 QALYs before discount, which corresponded to 17.29 years or 15.35 QALYs 
after discount. The SHS-exposed women were predicted to live 37.91 years and 
31.08 QALYs before discount and 16.76 years and 14.62 QALYs after discount. The 
estimated lifetime healthcare cost per woman in the SHS non-exposed group was 
US$11 214 before the discount and US$2465 after discount. The negative impact of 
SHS exposure on health outcomes and healthcare costs escalated as the time 
horizon increased, suggesting that the adverse impact of SHS exposure may have 
higher impact on the later part of the lifetime. The result was consistent 
across a wide range of assumptions.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy might underestimate the impact of SHS exposure on 
health outcomes, especially if the time horizon of the analysis is not long 
enough. Early intervention on smoking behaviour could substantially reduce 
direct healthcare costs and improve quality of life attributable to SHS 
exposure.

Socially disparate trends in lifespan variation: a trend study on income and 
mortality based on nationwide Danish register data.

Brønnum-Hansen H(1).

Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Social inequality trends in life expectancy are not informative as 
to changes in social disparity in the age-at-death distribution. The purpose of 
the study was to investigate social differentials in trends and patterns of 
adult mortality in Denmark.
METHODS: Register data on income and mortality from 1986 to 2014 were used to 
investigate trends in life expectancy, life disparity and the threshold age that 
separates 'premature' and 'late' deaths. Mortality compression was quantified 
and compared between income quartiles.
RESULTS: Since 1986, male life expectancy increased by 4.2 years for the lowest 
income quartile and by 8.4 years for the highest income quartile. The clear 
compression of mortality apparent in the highest income quartile did not occur 
for the lowest income quartile. Premature and late deaths accounted both by 2.1 
years of the increase in life expectancy in the lowest income quartile and by 
6.0 and 2.4 years, respectively, in the highest income quartile. Life expectancy 
increased by 5.2 years among women in the lowest income quartile, 2.4 years due 
to premature deaths and 2.8 years due to late deaths. The gain in life 
expectancy among women in the highest income quartile of 5.6 years was 
distributed by 5.0 and 0.6 years due to premature and late deaths, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that the increasing social gap in mortality 
appears differently in the change of the age-at-death distribution. Thus, no 
compression of mortality was seen in the lowest income quartile. The results do 
not provide support for a uniformly extension of pension age for all.

Cost-effectiveness of telehealthcare to patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease: results from the Danish 'TeleCare North' cluster-randomised 
trial.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealthcare solution 
in addition to usual care compared with usual care.
DESIGN: A 12-month cost-utility analysis conducted alongside a 
cluster-randomised trial.
SETTING: Community-based setting in the geographical area of North Denmark 
Region in Denmark.
PARTICIPANTS: 26 municipality districts define randomisation clusters with 13 
districts in each arm. 1225 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
were enrolled, of which 578 patients were randomised to telehealthcare and 647 
to usual care.
INTERVENTIONS: In addition to usual care, patients in the intervention group 
received a set of telehealthcare equipment and were monitored by a 
municipality-based healthcare team. Patients in the control group received usual 
care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-years gained 
from baseline up to 12 months follow-up.
RESULTS: From a healthcare and social sector perspective, the adjusted mean 
difference in total costs between telehealthcare and usual care was €728 (95% CI 
-754 to 2211) and the adjusted mean difference in quality-adjusted life-years 
gained was 0.0132 (95% CI -0.0083 to 0.0346). The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was €55 327 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Decision-makers should 
be willing to pay more than €55 000 to achieve a probability of 
cost-effectiveness >50%. This conclusion is robust to changes in the definition 
of hospital contacts and reduced intervention costs. Only in the most optimistic 
scenario combining the effects of all sensitivity analyses, does the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio fall below the UK thresholds values (€21 068 per 
quality-adjusted life-year).
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealthcare is unlikely to be a cost-effective addition to usual 
care, if it is offered to all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and if the willingness-to-pay threshold values from the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence are applied.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a therapist-guided 
internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) intervention for 
adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) compared with untreated 
patients on a waitlist.
DESIGN: Single-blinded randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: A research clinic within the regular child and adolescent mental health 
service in Stockholm, Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven adolescents (12-17 years) with a Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition diagnosis of OCD.
INTERVENTIONS: Either a 12-week, therapist-guided ICBT intervention or a wait 
list condition of equal duration.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost data were collected at baseline and after 
treatment, including healthcare use, supportive resources, prescription drugs, 
prescription-free drugs, school absence and productivity loss, as well as the 
cost of ICBT. Health outcomes were defined as treatment responder rate and 
quality-adjusted life years gain. Bootstrapped mixed model analyses were 
conducted comparing incremental costs and health outcomes between the groups 
from the societal and healthcare perspectives.
RESULTS: Compared with waitlist control, ICBT generated substantial societal 
cost savings averaging US$-144.98 (95% CI -159.79 to -130.16) per patient. The 
cost reductions were mainly driven by reduced healthcare use in the ICBT group. 
From the societal perspective, the probability of ICBT being cost saving 
compared with waitlist control was approximately 60%. From the healthcare 
perspective, the cost per additional responder to ICBT compared with waitlist 
control was approximately US$78.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that therapist-guided ICBT is a cost-effective 
treatment and results in societal cost savings, compared with patients who do 
not receive evidence-based treatment. Since, at present, most patients with OCD 
do not have access to evidence-based treatments, the results have important 
implications for the increasingly strained national and healthcare budgets. 
Future studies should compare the cost-effectiveness of ICBT with regular 
face-to-face CBT.

Long-term data demonstrate a higher oncological risk associated with active 
surveillance (AS) than initially anticipated. In particular, patients with more 
than two tumor-involved biopsy cores and/or Gleason-7a foci must be regarded as 
having an increased risk of developing an incurable stage of disease after an 
initial attempt of AS. For patients with Gleason-7a foci, the 15-year risk of 
suffering from an incurable tumor stage is reported as high as 60%. Furthermore, 
life expectancy must be regarded as one of the major risk factors to finally 
develop symptomatic incurable disease. A discussion has therefore started as to 
whether a high life expectancy should be regarded as an exclusion criterion 
against AS. An estimated life expectancy exceeding 15 or 20 years has been 
proposed for patients suffering from Gleason 7a or 6 foci at initial biopsy, 
respectively. Furthermore, it must be expected that a number of molecular risk 
factors will gain importance in the near future for the decision-making process 
for or against AS.

Patients with peritoneal metastasis (PM) from pancreatic cancer have a short 
life expectancy. Systemic combination chemotherapy leads to a median overall 
survival of 7-8 months. Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) 
is a treatment alternative, where studies in patients with PM from ovarian, 
gastric and colorectal cancer show a high safety profile and interesting 
results. This case study report data on the PIPAC treatment in patients with PM 
from pancreatic cancer. In a standard laparoscopy, chemotherapeutics (cisplatin 
and doxorubicin) are nebulized within the peritoneal cavity. After 30 min, the 
chemotherapeutics are evacuated through a closed system. The PIPAC procedure is 
repeated every 4-6 weeks. Five patients with PM from pancreatic cancer were 
treated with a total of 16 PIPAC procedures. All patients received >1 PIPAC and 
were eligible for evaluation of histological regression. Four patients 
demonstrated histological regression, and one patient had stable disease. Three 
patients are still alive, and the median overall survival is 14 months (range 
10-20) since the diagnosis of PM. The histological regression and survival 
figures in this pilot study suggest activity of PIPAC with low-dose cisplatin 
and doxorubicin in pretreated peritoneal metastasis of pancreatic origin. This 
should now be evaluated in prospective studies.

Management Considerations in Cancer Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Zogala RJ, Goutsouliak K, Suarez-Almazor ME.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a common inflammatory disease that requires treatment 
with immunosuppressants to control symptoms and avoid joint destruction. 
Managing cancer in patients with concomitant rheumatoid arthritis poses special 
challenges that require close coordination of care between oncologists and 
rheumatologists. Potential clinical issues needing special consideration 
include: 1) perioperative management in patients undergoing cancer surgery, 
which often requires discontinuation of antirrheumatic therapy; 2) use of 
immunosuppressant therapies for rheumatoid arthritis, especially biologic agents 
that inhibit cytokine and immune pathways, which conceivably could affect 
immune-mediated antitumor responses (the issues are different in patients with 
active cancer vs those with a past history of cancer and no recurrences); 3) 
management in the palliative care setting; and 4) use of cancer immunotherapy, 
such as checkpoint inhibitor agents, in patients with pre-existing rheumatoid 
arthritis. We explore these clinical issues in case-based scenarios. In all 
cases, clinical decision making must include a careful weighing of risks and 
benefits of both cancer treatments and antirrheumatic therapies, with attention 
given to prognosis and life expectancy, quality of life, and patient 
preferences.

Economic evaluation of strategies for restarting anticoagulation therapy after a 
first event of unprovoked venous thromboembolism.

Essentials Correct duration of treatment after a first unprovoked venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) is unknown. We assessed when restarting anticoagulation 
was worthwhile based on patient risk of recurrent VTE. When the risk over a 
one-year period is 17.5%, restarting is cost-effective. However, sensitivity 
analyses indicate large uncertainty in the estimates.
SUMMARY: Background Following at least 3 months of anticoagulation therapy after 
a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), there is uncertainty about the 
duration of therapy. Further anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of having 
a potentially fatal recurrent VTE but at the expense of a higher risk of 
bleeding, which can also be fatal. Objective An economic evaluation sought to 
estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of using a decision rule for 
restarting anticoagulation therapy vs. no extension of therapy in patients based 
on their risk of a further unprovoked VTE. Methods A Markov patient-level 
simulation model was developed, which adopted a lifetime time horizon with 
monthly time cycles and was from a UK National Health Service (NHS)/Personal 
Social Services (PSS) perspective. Results Base-case model results suggest that 
treating patients with a predicted 1 year VTE risk of 17.5% or higher may be 
cost-effective if decision makers are willing to pay up to £20 000 per quality 
adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
shows that the model was highly sensitive to overall parameter uncertainty and 
caution is warranted in selecting the optimal decision rule on 
cost-effectiveness grounds. Univariate sensitivity analyses indicate variables 
such as anticoagulation therapy disutility and mortality risks were very 
influential in driving model results. Conclusion This represents the first 
economic model to consider the use of a decision rule for restarting therapy for 
unprovoked VTE patients. Better data are required to predict long-term bleeding 
risks during therapy in this patient group.

[Controversies around QALYs].

[Article in Czech]

Rogalewicz V, Barták M.

The paper summarizes the criticisms of the QALY concept utilization in 
health-economic evaluations that has been growing stronger in the last years. 
Despite of its limitations, the QALY concept has been routinely used in many 
countries incl. the Czech Republic. However, some states disapproved QALYs as an 
optimizing criterion at the level of their political decisions. The critical 
reflection concerns both the theoretical and the experimental issues. Based on a 
literary review, fundamental arguments against the concept are summarized, and a 
synthesis of material objections is presented. The critical arguments focus on 
the foundations of the QALY concept in the economic theory, some ethical 
principles, inconsistencies and technical imperfections of the quality-of-life 
measurement tools used in QALY calculations, the substitution rule, differences 
between various diagnoses, and disregarding some other important parameters. As 
a whole, the critics´ arguments can be judged as quite strong. The future will 
show whether the critical arguments summarized in this paper will lead to a 
development of alternative tools that have a potential of eliminating 
imperfections in QALYs, and consequently provide more complex data for the 
decision process.Key words: cost-effectiveness - health technology assessment - 
HTA - QALY - utility measure for medical interventions.
