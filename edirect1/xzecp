and investigated the effect of factors such as oligonucleotide length, 
concentration, composition, and temperature on the extent of primer extension. 
We observe a surprisingly prolonged equilibration process in the VCG system that 
enables a considerable extent of reaction. We find that environmental 
fluctuations would be essential for continuous templated extension of the entire 
VCG system since the shortest oligonucleotides can only bind to templates at low 
temperatures, while the longest oligonucleotides require high-temperature spikes 
to escape from inactive configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that primer 
extension is significantly enhanced when the mix of VCG oligonucleotides is 
preactivated. We discuss the necessity of ongoing in situ activation chemistry 
for continuous and accurate VCG replication.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy for lung-transplant patients, especially those with 
cystic fibrosis (CF), is leading increasingly to more retransplantations.
DESIGN: Retrospective monocentric cohort study.
SETTING: Foch University Hospital, Suresnes, France.
PARTICIPANTS: CF patients having had a primary double-lung transplantation 
(pLgTx) or a retransplantation (reLgTx) from 2012 to 2021.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The authors compared the main intraoperative and 
early postoperative features between pLgTx (n = 258) and reLgTx (n = 24). 
Demographic characteristics were similar. No patients with retransplantations 
had a preoperative bridge with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 
however, 23 patients had it in the pLgTx group (p = 0.24). Patients with 
retransplants had longer second graft ischemic time (p = 0.02), larger 
intraoperative bleeding volume (p = 0.001) and blood transfusion (p = 0.009 for 
packed red blood cells), increased blood lactate concentrations (p = 0.002), and 
higher norepinephrine dose at end-surgery (p = 0.001). Extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation was used during surgery in 94 patients in the pLgTx group and 12 
patients in the reLgTx group (p = 0.39). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
could not be weaned after surgery in 55 patients in the pLgTx group and 4 in the 
reLgTx group (p = 0.54). Despite worse preoperative renal function in the reLgTx 
group (p < 0.001), there was no difference concerning renal replacement therapy 
in the intensive care unit between groups (p = 0.08). There were no differences 
between groups concerning the main complications, including primary graft 
dysfunction. Although the difference was not statistically different (p = 0.17), 
mortality was 3 times higher in the reLgTx group.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative period of retransplantation was more convoluted but 
had a similar ECMO profile to primary transplantation. In addition, the early 
postoperative period was similar.

BACKGROUND: Social support and social networks have long been postulated to 
impact health outcomes but their impact on life expectancy and disability in 
older adults remains poorly quantified.
METHODS: As part of the Cardiovascular Health Study, we followed 5,749 adults 
aged 65 years and older from 4 US field centers for 25 years. We assessed the 
Lubben social network score [range 0-50] and a social support score [range 0-24] 
derived from the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL-12) in two 
consecutive years starting at study recruitment. We used remaining years of life 
(YOL) from study enrollment to death to approximate life expectancy. We defined 
years of active life (YAL) as the number of study years in which participants 
lived without any difficulties in activities of daily living. We used 
compression of disability to reflect the proportion of life lived able 
(YAL/YOL). We used linear regression to adjust for socio-demographics and 
comorbidity.
RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) scores were 32.3 ± 6.8 points for 
social network score and 8.3 ± 2.4 points for social support score. For every 
1-SD increase in social network score, adjusted participant life expectancy was 
0.40 years higher (95% CI 0.22-0.58; p<0.0001) and disability-free life 
expectancy 0.35 years higher (95% CI 0.18-0.53; p<0.0001). The association with 
life expectancy was modified by participant age (p<0.001), but it remained 
significant even among participants aged ≥75 years (3 months per SD; 95% CI 
0.1-6 months, p = 0.04). Further adjustment for frailty did not attenuate the 
estimates. The social support scale was not significantly associated with YOL or 
YAL after adjustment for social network score, and neither measure was 
associated with compression of disability.
DISCUSSION: In older adults, higher social network scores are significantly 
associated with longer life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy.

AIMS: To describe morbidity and mortality trends of type 2 diabetes in 
Australia, from 1990 to 2019, compared with similar sociodemographic index (SDI) 
countries.
METHODS: Australia-specific Global Burden of Diseases data were used to estimate 
age-standardised, age-specific, and sex-specific rates for prevalence, years 
lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), and deaths due to type 2 diabetes between 1990 and 2019. 
Australian data were compared with 14 similar SDI countries.
RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes increased in Australia between 1990 and 2019. The 
age-standardised prevalence increased from 1,985 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 
1,786.7-2195.3] per 100,000 population, to 3,429 [95% CI 3,053.3-3,853.7]. Cases 
tripled, from 379,532 [342,465-419,475] to 1,307,261 [1,165,522-1,461,180]. The 
age-standardised death rates doubled, from 2,098 [1,953-2,203] per 100,000, to 
4,122 [3,617-4,512]. DALYs doubled, from 70,348 [59,187-83,500] to 169,763 
[129,792-216,150], with increases seen in YLDs and YLLs. Men displayed higher 
rates. Compared to similar SDI countries, Australia ranked 4th in terms of 
burden for type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of type 2 diabetes in Australia has increased 
considerably over three decades. There is an urgent need to prioritise resource 
allocation for prevention programs, screening initiatives to facilitate early 
detection, and effective and accessible management strategies for the large 
proportion of the population impacted by type 2 diabetes.

AIMS: Pandoraea pnomenusa MCB032 completely degrades chlorobenzene, whose 
metabolic pathway is encoded by cbs and clc gene clusters. The putative 
regulatory factors ClcR and CbsR are predicted to regulate the cbs and clc gene 
clusters. This research aims to understand the function of ClcR and CbsR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that the cbsFAaAbAcAdB operon 
that encodes catabolic pathways for the degradation of chlorobenzene to 
chlorocatechol is located on an operon. Moreover, the clcABCDE operon is 
involved in the 3-chlorocatechol pathway. Gene knockout and transcriptional 
analysis showed that the transcription of the cbsFAaAbAcAdB operon is positively 
regulated by CbsR, whereas the clcABCDE operon is activated by ClcR. Primer 
extension analysis was used to locate the transcription start sites of the 
cbsFAaAbAcAdB and cbsR operons. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses 
showed that CbsR is bound to the sites in the promoter regions of cbsFAaAbAcAdB 
and cbsR operons.
CONCLUSION: The XylR/NtrC-type regulator CbsR positively regulates the 
transcription of the cbsFAaAbAcAdB operon encoding the upstream pathway of 
chlorobenzene catabolism, while the LysR-type regulator ClcR activates the 
clcABCDE operon encoding the downstream pathway.

This paper presents a fine-grained and multi-sourced dataset for environmental 
determinants of health collected from England cities. We provide health outcomes 
of citizens covering physical health (COVID-19 cases, asthma medication 
expenditure, etc.), mental health (psychological medication expenditure), and 
life expectancy estimations. We present the corresponding environmental 
determinants from four perspectives, including basic statistics (population, 
area, etc.), behavioural environment (availability of tobacco, health-care 
services, etc.), built environment (road density, street view features, etc.), 
and natural environment (air quality, temperature, etc.). To reveal regional 
differences, we extract and integrate massive environment and health indicators 
from heterogeneous sources into two unified spatial scales, i.e., at the middle 
layer super output area (MSOA) and the city level, via big data processing and 
deep learning. Our data holds great promise for diverse audiences, such as 
public health researchers and urban designers, to further unveil the 
environmental determinants of health and design methodology for a healthy, 
sustainable city.

Health systems in Israel and around the world are facing an increase in life 
expectancy and chronic diseases, along with technological developments, 
healthcare transparency, and increased customer (patients') requirements. 
Medical teams must provide high professional responses to these challenges. 
Nurse training in Israel occurs on both academic and professional levels. The 
last decade has shown an academic trend in the nursing profession, where most 
training options integrate a bachelor's degree and a registered nurse 
certificate. At the professional level, academic nurses can expand their 
professional competence through advanced clinical training, and a nurse 
practitioner program. There is a growing trend among policy makers for placing 
nurses with such recognized training in various key positions such as head 
nurse, and shift managers in specific wards and units.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) is prevalent in Chinese patients with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to simulate Chinese patients 
with newly diagnosed RRMS and their matched control cohort without MS for the 
risks of developing CI, developing secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and 
mortality. Both English and Chinese bibliographic databases were searched for 
evidence to estimate model inputs. Base case analysis and sensitivity analysis 
were conducted for the point estimations and uncertainty of the measured burden 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Model simulations estimated that the lifetime cumulative risk of CI in 
newly diagnosed RRMS patients was 85.2%. Relative to the matched control cohort, 
newly diagnosed RRMS patients were associated with a lower life expectancy (33.2 
years vs. 41.7 years, difference: -8.5 years), lower quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) (18.4 QALY vs. 38.4 QALY, difference: -19.9 QALY), and higher lifetime 
medical costs (¥613,883 vs. ¥202,726, difference: ¥411,157) and indirect costs 
(¥1,099,021 vs. ¥94,612, difference: ¥1,004,410). Patients who developed CI 
accounted for at least half of the measured burden. The disease burden outcomes 
were mainly driven by the risk of developing CI, progression risk from RRMS to 
SPMS, hazard ratios of mortality associated with CI relative to no CI, utility 
of patients with RRMS, annual relapse risk, and annual costs of personal care.
CONCLUSION: Most Chinese patients with newly diagnosed RRMS are likely to 
develop CI in their lifetime, and such patients that develop CI could 
significantly contribute to the disease burden of RRMS.

Comment in
    Europace. 2023 Mar 30;:

AIMS: The randomized, controlled EAST-AFNET 4 trial showed that early rhythm 
control (ERC) reduces the rate of a composite primary outcome (cardiovascular 
death, stroke, or hospitalization for worsening heart failure or acute coronary 
syndrome) by ∼20%. The current study examined the cost-effectiveness of ERC 
compared to usual care.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis was based on 
data from the German subsample of the EAST-AFNET 4 trial (n = 1664/2789 
patients). Over a 6-year time horizon and from a healthcare payer's perspective, 
ERC was compared to usual care regarding costs (hospitalization and medication) 
and effects (time to primary outcome; years survived). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves were constructed to visualize uncertainty. Early rhythm 
control was associated with higher costs [+€1924, 95% CI (-€399, €4246)], 
resulting in ICERs of €10 638 per additional year without a primary outcome and 
€22 536 per life year gained. The probability of ERC being cost-effective 
compared to usual care was ≥95% or ≥80% at a willingness-to-pay value of ≥€55 
000 per additional year without a primary outcome or life year gained, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: From a German healthcare payer's perspective, health benefits of ERC 
may come at reasonable costs as indicated by the ICER point estimates. Taking 
statistical uncertainty into account, cost-effectiveness of ERC is highly 
probable at a willingness-to-pay value of ≥€55 000 per additional life year or 
year without a primary outcome. Future studies examining the cost-effectiveness 
of ERC in other countries, subgroups with higher benefit from rhythm control 
therapy, or cost-effectiveness of different modes of ERC are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To describe how utility weights and disability weights have been used 
in the context of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs)-based cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of pediatric vaccines 
for infectious diseases and assess the comparability between weights.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of CEAs of pediatric vaccines for 16 
infectious diseases, published between January 2013 and December 2020 and using 
QALYs or DALYs as outcome measure. Data on values and sources of weights for the 
estimation of QALYs and DALYs were extracted from studies and compared across 
similar health states. Reporting was conducted according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
RESULTS: Out of 2154 articles identified, 216 CEAs met our inclusion criteria. 
Of the included studies, 157 used utility weights and 59 used disability weights 
in their valuation of health states. In QALY studies, the source, background, 
who's preferences (adults'/children's) were applied and adjustments made to 
utility weights were poorly reported. In DALY studies, the Global Burden of 
Disease study was most often referenced. Valuation weights for similar health 
states varied within QALY studies and between DALY and QALY studies, but no 
systematic differences were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified considerable gaps in the way valuation 
weights are used and reported on in CEA. The nonstandardized use of weights may 
lead to different conclusions about cost-effectiveness of vaccines and policy 
decisions.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) affects about 2% to 3% of the general population, 
mostly women, and is the most common cause of primary chronic mitral 
regurgitation (MR) in western countries. The natural history is heterogeneous 
and widely determined by the severity of MR. Although most patients remain 
asymptomatic with a near-normal life expectancy, approximately 5% to 10 % 
progress to severe MR. As largely recognized, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction 
due to chronic volume overload per se identifies a subgroup at risk of cardiac 
death. However, there is rising evidence of a link between MVP and life 
threating ventricular arrhythmias (VAs)/sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a small 
subset of middle-aged patients without significant MR, heart failure and 
remodeled hearts. The present review focuses on the underlying mechanism of 
electric instability and unexpected cardiac death in this subset of young 
patients, from the myocardial scarring of the LV infero-lateral wall due to 
mechanical stretch exerted by the prolapsing leaflets and mitral annular 
disjunction, to the inflammation's impact on fibrosis pathways along with a 
constitutional hyperadrenergic state. The heterogeneity of clinical course 
reveals a necessity of risk stratification, preferably through noninvasive 
multimodality imaging, that will help to identify and prevent adverse scenarios 
in young MVP patients.

Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) may not only signal current visual input 
but also relevant contextual information such as reward expectancy and the 
subject's spatial position. Such contextual representations need not be 
restricted to V1 but could participate in a coherent mapping throughout sensory 
cortices. Here, we show that spiking activity coherently represents a 
location-specific mapping across auditory cortex (AC) and lateral, secondary 
visual cortex (V2L) of freely moving rats engaged in a sensory detection task on 
a figure-8 maze. Single-unit activity of both areas showed extensive 
similarities in terms of spatial distribution, reliability, and position coding. 
Importantly, reconstructions of subject position based on spiking activity 
displayed decoding errors that were correlated between areas. Additionally, we 
found that head direction, but not locomotor speed or head angular velocity, was 
an important determinant of activity in AC and V2L. By contrast, variables 
related to the sensory task cues or to trial correctness and reward were not 
markedly encoded in AC and V2L. We conclude that sensory cortices participate in 
coherent, multimodal representations of the subject's sensory-specific location. 
These may provide a common reference frame for distributed cortical sensory and 
motor processes and may support crossmodal predictive processing.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) is increasing worldwide, while there is lack of 
information on how this affects older individuals' use of formal home care 
services.
AIM: We aimed to decompose LE into years with and without home care services and 
estimate projected number of users towards 2050 in Norway for people 70 years or 
older.
METHODS: This study is based on a sample of 25,536 participants aged 70 years 
and older in the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) survey 2 (1995-1997), 3 
(2006-2008), or 4 (2017-2019) linked with national data on mortality. Prevalence 
of home care services was standardised to the Norwegian population by age and 
sex. The Sullivan method was used to estimate expected years with and without 
home help services and nursing services for the years 1995, 2006 and 2016. Data 
from HUNT4 and Statistics Norway were used to estimate projected use of these 
services between 2020 and 2050.
RESULTS: During 1995-2017, the use of home help services decreased from 22.6% to 
6.2% (p < 0.001), and from 6.4% to 5.5% (p = 0.004) for home nursing services. 
Adjusted for age and sex, the use of home help services decreased significantly 
over time (p < 0.001), while home nursing services were stable (p = 0.69). LE at 
age 70 increased from 11.9 to 15.3 years in men (p < 0.05) during 1995-2017, and 
from 14.7 to 17.1 in women (p < 0.05). In the same period, the expected years 
receiving home help decreased from 2.6 to 1.1 in men (p < 0.05), and from 4.4 to 
2.1 in women (p < 0.05). The expected years receiving home nursing increased 
from 0.6 to 0.9 in men (p < 0.05), and from 1.3 to 1.7 in women (p < 0.05). 
Projected numbers of people 70+ in Norway in need of either of these services 
were estimated to rise from 64,000 in 2020 to 160,000 in 2050.
CONCLUSION: While overall life expectancy increased, the expected years 
receiving home help have decreased and home nursing slightly increased among the 
Norwegian population aged 70 years and older during 1995-2017. However, the 
substantial increase in the projected number of older adults using home care 
services in the future is an alert for the current health care planners.

BACKGROUND: Given the chronic nature of psoriasis and the loss of response that 
can be observed with therapies over time, it is important to understand the 
long-term efficacy of new treatments.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate maintenance of Week 16 responses with bimekizumab (BKZ) 
treatment through Year 3, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
METHODS: Data were pooled from BKZ-treated patients in the 52-week (BE VIVID) 
and 56-week (BE READY and BE SURE) phase III studies, and their ongoing 
open-label extension (OLE), BE BRIGHT. Efficacy outcomes are reported through 
3 years of BKZ treatment in patients with an efficacy response at Week 16. 
Missing data were imputed primarily using modified nonresponder imputation 
(mNRI), with nonresponder imputation and observed case data also reported.
RESULTS: A total of 989 patients were randomized to BKZ at baseline in BE VIVID, 
BE READY and BE SURE. At Week 16, 693 patients achieved ≥ 90% reduction from 
baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90), 503 achieved 100% 
reduction from baseline in PASI (PASI 100), 694 achieved absolute PASI ≤ 2 and 
597 achieved body surface area (BSA) ≤ 1%, and continued into the OLE. Of these, 
93.0% maintained PASI 90, 80.8% maintained PASI 100, 94.0% maintained PASI ≤ 2 
and 90.3% maintained BSA ≤ 1% responses through to 3 years of BKZ treatment 
(mNRI). Among Week 16 PASI 90 responders, 96.8% and 72.5% also achieved 
Investigator's Global Assessment 0/1 and PASI 100 at Week 16, respectively, and 
92.2% and 73.4% achieved these responses at Year 3 (mNRI). Among Week 16 PASI 
100 responders, 76.3% also achieved Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 at 
Week 16, and DLQI 0/1 response increased with continuous BKZ treatment to 89.0% 
at Year 3 (mNRI).
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of clinical response were maintained through to 3 years 
of BKZ treatment in the vast majority of Week 16 responders. Long-term treatment 
with BKZ was efficacious, with important benefits for health-related quality of 
life, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Internet addiction for adolescent, which is widely concerned by the whole 
society, has become a public health problem. Internet addiction not only had a 
negative impact on physical and mental development of adolescents, but also was 
harmful to their study, life, interpersonal communication and personality 
formation, and so on. In recent years, the data analysis methods of longitudinal 
research have developed rapidly. It not only focused on the overall average 
growth trend, but also considered the differences in the individual trends. 
Latent profile transition analysis (LPTA) is an extension of latent profile 
analysis (LPA) and latent transition analysis (LTA), and is a longitudinal data 
analysis method. LPTA can simultaneously estimate group membership in multiple 
time points and their latent transition tendency among these subgroups between 
each two time points. This study used LPTA to explore the development trend of 
adolescent internet addiction over time and its influencing factors. 1033 
adolescents participated in a short-term 6-month longitudinal study with a total 
of three tests. Participants completed internet addiction test, self-rating 
anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale. The results showed that: (1) 
There are three categories of adolescent internet addiction, namely non-internet 
addiction group, low-internet addiction group and high-internet addiction group. 
(2) Non-internet addiction group has a strong stability. Low-internet addiction 
group has a high probability to become non-internet addiction group or 
high-internet addiction group. (3) Boys are more likely than girls to develop 
into high-internet addiction group. Anxiety and depression both affect the 
development of adolescent internet addiction.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked genetic disease affecting 1 in 
5000 young males worldwide annually. Patients experience muscle weakness and 
loss of ambulation at an early age, with ∼75% reduced life expectancy. Recently 
developed genetic editing strategies aim to convert severe DMD phenotypes to a 
milder disease course. Among these, the antisense oligonucleotide (AO)-mediated 
exon skipping and the adeno-associated viral-delivered clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated protein 9 
(adeno-associated viral (AAV)-delivered CRISPR/Cas9) gene editing have shown 
promising results in restoring dystrophin protein expression and functionality 
in skeletal and heart muscle in both animals and human cells in vivo and in 
vitro. However, therapeutic benefits currently remain unclear. The aim of this 
review is to compare the potential therapeutic benefits, efficacy, safety, and 
clinical progress of AO-mediated exon skipping and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing 
strategies. Both techniques have demonstrated therapeutic benefit and long-term 
efficacy in clinical trials. AAV-delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 may potentially correct 
disease-causing mutations following a single treatment compared to the required 
continuous AO/PMO-delivery of exon skipping drugs. The latter has the potential 
to increase the dystrophin expression in skeletal/heart muscle with sustained 
effects. However, therapeutic challenges including the need for optimised 
delivery must be overcome in to advance current clinical data.

Introduction: Cardiac amyloidoses are the most fatal manifestation of systemic 
amyloidoses. It is believed the number of cases to be greatly underestimated 
mostly due to misdiagnosis. Particularly, the involvement of TTR V30M in the 
heart of ATTRV30M amyloidosis has not been completely understood specifically in 
terms of implicated cellular pathways, heart function and cardiac physiology. In 
the present work we proposed to characterize TTR V30M cardiac involvement 
particularly at the tissue cellular level in a mouse model. Methods: HSF ± hTTR 
V30M mice, a model that expresses human TTRV30M in a Ttr null background, widely 
used for the characterization and modulation of neurological features of 
ATTRV30M amyloidosis was used. SDS-PAGE of cardiac homogenates followed by 
Western blot was performed. Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence 
analyses were carried out to determine TTR deposition pattern and 
sub-localization. Results: Western blots were able to detect TTR in its 
monomeric state at ∼14 kDa. Immunofluorescent images showed TTR was found mostly 
in the intercellular spaces. Blood contamination was excluded by CD31 staining. 
Tissues were Congo Red negative. Upon TTR and macrophages (CD68) staining in the 
cardiac tissue a clear tendency of macrophage convergence to the tissue regions 
where TTR was more abundant was observed. Moreover, in some instances it was 
possible to detect co-localization of both fluorophores. Cardiac fibroblasts 
were stained with PDGFr-alpha, and here the co-localization was not so evident 
although there was some degree of co-occurrence. The hearts of transgenic mice 
revealed higher content of Galectin-3. Conclusion: This animal model and 
associated features observed as result of cardiac TTR deposition provide a 
promising and invaluable research tool for a better understanding of the 
implicated pathways that lead to the lethality associated to TTR cardiac 
amyloidosis. New therapeutic strategies can be tested and ultimately this will 
lead to improved treatment alternatives capable of increasing patient's quality 
of life and life expectancy and, hopefully to eradicate a condition that is 
silently spreading worldwide.

BACKGROUND: As in other solid tumors, increasing evidence indicates that 
patients diagnosed with a limited number of prostate cancer metastases, 
so-called oligometastases, have a better prognosis than patients with extensive 
metastatic disease. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is now considered an 
option in this population.Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1) are 
targeted by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Preclinical studies have shown that 
the tumor immune microenvironment changes when combining radiotherapy with 
immunotherapy, especially with hypofractionated radiotherapy.The oligometastatic 
setting appears to be the most relevant clinical situation for evaluating the 
immune response generated by radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in 
patients with an intact immune system.We hypothesize that durvalumab will
