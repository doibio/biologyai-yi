OBJECTIVES: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) has high morbidity, disability, and 
mortality rates and is a major contributor to the global disease burden. This 
study aimed to obtain a more detailed description of the burden of IHD through 
secondary analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019.
STUDY DESIGN: This is an epidemiological study.
METHODS: Data for this study were obtained from the GBD 2019 database. Annual 
average percentage change (AAPC) was calculated to assess trends in IHD 
prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
Regional and national burden of IHD was assessed by stratifying by sex, age, and 
socio-demographic index (SDI).
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the global prevalence of IHD, morbidity cases, 
deaths, and DALYs increased, but the age-standardized rates of IHD burden 
decreased. Morbidity, mortality, and DALY rates for IHD in both sexes increased 
with age. The prevalence, incidence, mortality, and DALY rates were higher in 
men than women in all age groups. In particular, the male-to-female ratios for 
mortality and DALY rates peaked among 35-39 year olds, while the male-to-female 
ratios for prevalence and morbidity peaked among 55-59 year olds. 
Age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and DALY rates were higher in low- and 
middle-income regions than in other SDI regions.
CONCLUSION: Although age-standardized prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and 
age-standardized DALY rates due to IHD decreased globally from 1990 to 2019, 
age-standardized prevalence and morbidity of IHD increased in Low SDI, 
Low-middle SDI, and Middle SDI regions.

Chronic liver disease inevitably progresses to liver cirrhosis, significantly 
compromising patients' overall survival and quality of life. However, a glimmer 
of hope emerges with the emergence of mesenchymal stem cells, possessing 
remarkable abilities for self-renewal, differentiation, and immunomodulation. 
Leveraging their potential, MSCs have become a focal point in both basic and 
clinical trials, offering a promising therapeutic avenue to impede fibrosis 
progression and enhance the life expectancy of individuals battling hepatic 
cirrhosis. This comprehensive review serves to shed light on the origin of MSCs, 
the intricate mechanisms underlying cirrhosis treatment, and the cutting-edge 
advancements in basic and clinical research surrounding MSC-based therapies for 
liver cirrhosis patients.

A woman in her 20s presented with neck pain, slurred speech and left-sided 
weakness. She successfully underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for total 
occlusion of the basilar artery and made full neurological recovery. Initial 
ultrasound Doppler of legs (USDL) did not show any deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 
However, 2 days later, a repeat USDL revealed an extensive proximal DVT in the 
right common femoral vein. CT scan confirmed a haematoma arising from the 
femoral access site causing compression of the adjacent common femoral vein. 
This may have initiated DVT formation or exacerbated extension of a previously 
undetected DVT. Echocardiogram revealed a patent foramen ovale. As the patient 
was asymptomatic, delayed or missed diagnosis of DVT would have put her at risk 
of life-threatening pulmonary embolism or further strokes. Clinicians should 
maintain a high index of suspicion of DVT as a direct procedural complication 
from MT so treatment can be initiated promptly.

INTRODUCTION: With longer life expectancy in people living with HIV (PLWH) on 
antiretroviral therapy, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become a common cause 
of mortality among them. Abacavir has been associated with an increased risk of 
myocardial infarction, but the mechanism is unknown. Additionally, abacavir may 
be obesogenic which could mediate an additional risk factor of CVD. We aim to 
investigate if discontinuation of abacavir will have a favourable impact on body 
weight and cardiac parameters in PLWH.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Randomised, controlled, superiority trial of virologically 
suppressed PLWH on dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC) for ≥6 
months. In total, 70 PLWH will be randomised 1:2 to either continue DTG/ABC/3TC 
or to switch to dolutegravir and lamivudine (DTG/3TC) providing the power of 80% 
at alpha 5% to detect a mean difference in weight change of 2 kg (Δ) given an SD 
of 2.7 kg. Follow-up will be 48 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline and 
week 48. Primary outcome will be change in mean body weight from baseline to 
week 24 and 48 evaluated in a linear mixed model. Secondary outcomes will be 
changes in cardiac, inflammatory and metabolic parameters, fat distribution, 
coagulation, endothelial, platelet function, quality of life and virological 
control from baseline to week 48. Measurements include CT of thorax and abdomen, 
external carotid artery ultrasound, liver elastography and dual energy X-ray 
absorptiometry and blood analysis. Plasma HIV RNA will be measured at baseline, 
week 4, 24 and 48. Forty participants (20 from each arm) will be included in a 
substudy involving cardiac MRI at baseline and week 48. Twenty non-HIV-infected 
controls will be included with a single scan to compare with baseline scan data.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Result from this study will lead to a better 
understanding of the association between antiretroviral therapy and the impact 
on weight and risk of CVD. Findings will be useful for both clinicians and PLWH 
in the guidance of a more individualised HIV treatment. Results from the main 
study and the substudies will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed 
journal(s). The AVERTAS study is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Capital 
Region, Denmark (H-20011433), Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT no.

OBJECTIVES: Family and friend caregivers often feel overwhelmed by and 
ill-prepared for their responsibilities. Many feel helpless living with 
uncertainty about the outcome of the patient's illness, which leads to 
existential distress. Supportive care interventions that address existential 
distress by promoting meaning and purpose buffer the negative effects of 
caregiver burden and promote resilience and growth. The purpose of this scoping 
review is to describe the depth and breadth of available interventions targeting 
caregiver existential distress.
METHODS: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute's scoping review methods and 
applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
Extension checklist. SCOPUS, Ovid MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched 
for interventions that targeted existential distress by promoting 
meaning-making, spiritual well-being, post-traumatic growth and/or benefit 
finding for caregivers of seriously ill adult patients.
RESULTS: We screened 1377 titles/abstracts and 42 full-text articles. Thirty-one 
articles (28 unique studies) met inclusion criteria. Most interventions were 
designed for caregivers supporting patients with cancer (n=14) or patients 
receiving palliative care (n=9). Promising interventions included 
Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers, Meaning-Based Intervention 
for Patients and their Partners, Legacy Intervention for Family Enactment, 
Family Participatory Dignity Therapy and Existential Behavioural Therapy. More 
than half of the studies (n=20, 64%) were in the feasibility/acceptability/pilot 
stage of intervention testing.
CONCLUSION: Large randomised controlled trials with more diverse samples of 
caregivers are needed. Future research should explore the impact of delivering 
meaning-making interventions to caregivers throughout the illness trajectory. 
Developing strategies for scaling up and conducting cost analyses will narrow 
the research and practice gap for meaning-making interventions.

BACKGROUND: The increased survival provided by the access, development, and 
evolution of antiretroviral drugs (ARV) greatly increased the life expectancy of 
people living with HIV (PWH). This has also led to an increased occurrence of 
diseases or morbidities related to aging. In individuals with multiple 
comorbidities, the simultaneous use of multiple medications, also known as 
polypharmacy, is common, and rational use of medications is essential. This 
study aims to describe the pharmacotherapeutic profile, estimate the prevalence 
of polypharmacy and identify factors associated with polypharmacy in a cohort of 
adult PWH from a referral unit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study including PWH on ARV who received at least one 
medical prescription (outpatient/hospitalized) in 2019. We described the 
proportion of prescribed medications according to ARV and Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) classes stratified by age (< 50 vs. ≥50 years). Polypharmacy was 
defined as ≥ 5 medications prescribed beyond ARV. Logistic regression models 
assessed demographic and clinical factors associated with polypharmacy.
RESULTS: A total of 143,306 prescriptions of 4547 PWH were analyzed. Median age 
was 44.4 years (IQR:35.4-54.1) and 1615 (35.6%) were ≥ 50 years. A total of 2958 
(65.1%) participants self-identified as cisgender man, 1365 (30.0%) as cisgender 
woman, and 224 (4.9%) as transgender women. Most self-declared Black/Pardo 
(2582; 65.1%) and 1984 (44.0%) completed elementary education or less. Median 
time since HIV diagnosis was 10.9 years (IQR:6.2-17.7). Most frequently 
prescribed concomitant medications were nervous system (64.8%), antiinfectives 
for systemic use (60.0%), alimentary tract and metabolism (45.9%), 
cardiovascular system (40.0%) and respiratory system (37.1%). Prevalence of 
polypharmacy was 50.6% (95%CI: 49.2-52.1). Model results indicated that being 
older, self-identify as cisgender woman, having less education and longer time 
since HIV diagnosis increased the odds of polypharmacy.
CONCLUSIONS: We found high rates of polypharmacy and concomitant medication use 
in a cohort of PWH in Brazil. Targeted interventions should be prioritized to 
prevent interactions and improve treatment, especially among individuals using 
central nervous system and cardiovascular medications, as well as certain groups 
such as cisgender women, older individuals and those with lower education. 
Standardized protocols for continuous review of patients' therapeutic regimens 
should be implemented.

The long-term safety and efficacy of 52-week application of oxybutynin 
hydrochloride 20% lotion (20% OL) for the treatment of primary palmar 
hyperhidrosis (PPHH) in Japanese patients aged ≥12 years were evaluated in an 
open-label extension (OLE) of a 4-week, randomized, double-blind (DB) study. The 
OLE included 114 patients who completed the DB study and wished to continue 
treatment and 12 new patients. In the safety analysis population (125 patients), 
the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 
79.2% and 36.0%, respectively. Serious AEs were observed in two patients but 
were considered unrelated to the investigational drug. The incidence of AEs that 
led to study discontinuation was 1.6%. The incidence of application site AEs and 
ADRs was 35.2% and 26.4%, respectively. The severity of most events was mild. 
The incidence of anticholinergic AEs related to dry mouth was 3.2% for thirst 
and 0.8% for dry throat. The long-term efficacy of 20% OL was confirmed by a 
long-lasting reduction in sweat volume and improvement in the Hyperhidrosis 
Disease Severity Scale and Dermatology Life Quality Index. This study has 
several limitations: First the results may include some bias because most of the 
participants were from the prior DB study; second, the results may not be 
generalizable because only a few participants were in the age group most 
susceptible to PPHH (i.e., < 15 years old); and third, the study did not obtain 
safety information from treatment for more than 52 weeks, so this information 
must be collected in clinical practice in the future. No reduced therapeutic 
effect was observed in patients with PPHH in this study after 52-week 
application of 20% OL. Also, few patients experienced serious AEs or AEs that 
led to study treatment discontinuation.

Both Stevens-johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic-epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are 
generally medication-induced pathological conditions that mostly affect the 
epidermis and mucus membranes. Nearly 1 to 2 patients per 1,000,000 population 
are affected annually with SJS and TEN, and sometimes these maladies can cause 
serious life-threatening events. The reported death rates for SJS range from 1 
to 5%, and 25 to 35% for TEN. The mortality risk may even be higher among 
elderly patients, especially in those who are affected by a significant amount 
of epidermal detachment. More than 50% of TEN patients who survive the illness 
may experience long-term lower quality of life and lesser life expectancy. The 
clinical and histopathological conditions of SJS and TEN are characterized by 
mucocutaneous discomfort, haemorrhagic erosions, erythema, and occasionally 
severe epidermal separation that can turn into ulcerative patches and dermal 
necrosis. The relative difference between SJS and TEN is the degree of 
ulcerative skin detachment, making them two extremes of a spectrum of severe 
cutaneous adverse drug-induced reactions (cADRs). In the majority of cases, 
serious drug-related hypercreativities are considered the main cause of SJS & 
TEN; however, herpes simplex virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections may also 
produce similar type clinical conditions. The aetiology of a lesser number of 
cases and their underlying causative factors remain unknown. Among the drugs 
with a 'greater likelihood' of causing TEN & SJS are carbamazepine (CBZ), 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, phenytoin, aminopenicillins, allopurinol, 
cephalosporins, sulphonamides, antibiotics, quinolones, phenobarbital, and 
NSAIDs of the oxicam variety. There is also a strong genetic link between the 
occurrence of SJS and IEN in the Han Chinese population. Such genetic 
association is based on the human leukocyte antigen (HLA-B*1502) and the 
co-administration of carbamazepine. The diagnosis of SJS is made mostly on the 
gross observations of clinical symptoms, and confirmed by the histopathological 
examination of dermal biopsies of the patients. The differential diagnoses 
consist of the exclusion of Pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA 
dermatosis, paraneoplastic pemphigus, disseminated fixed bullous drug eruption, 
acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and staphylococcal scalded 
skin syndrome (SSSS). The management of SJS & TEN is rather difficult and 
complicated, and there is sometimes a high risk of mortality in seriously 
inflicted patients. Urgent medical attention is needed for early diagnosis, 
estimation of the SCORTEN prognosis, identification and discontinuation of the 
causative agent as well as highdose injectable Ig therapeutic interventions 
along with specialized supportive care. Historical aspects, aetiology, 
mechanisms, and incidences of SJS and TEN are discussed. An update on the 
genetic occurrence of these medication-related hypersensitive ailments as well 
as different therapy options and management of patients is also provided.

ABSTRACT: Calorie restriction (CR) is a widely recognized dietary approach with 
beneficial impacts on the entire body, including enhancements in oxidative 
metabolism and life span extension, while maintaining nutritional balance and 
calorie intake. However, CR leads to reductions in skeletal muscle and fat mass 
due to decreased food intake. Consequently, CR significantly modifies the 
metabolic profile of the entire body and its tissues. The observed benefits in 
skeletal muscle during CR may be attributed to CR-induced signaling mediators or 
significant changes in blood profiles associated with CR that regulate 
homeostasis maintenance. This study aimed to examine the mammalian target of 
rapamycin signaling and mitochondrial function of skeletal muscle from mice that 
undergone 8 weeks of CR and cells cultured in their serum to determine whether 
changes in blood secreted factors during CR affect skeletal muscle cells. 
C57BL6/J male mice were used. For 8 weeks, these were subjected to ad libitum 
(AL) or 40% CR. C2C12 myotubes were subsequently treated with media containing 
10% mouse serum from AL or CR for 24 h. The results indicated that 8 weeks of CR 
decreased muscle mass and protein synthesis response compared with the AL group. 
Interestingly, myotubes conditioned with CR serum exhibited an elevation in the 
protein synthesis response compared with those treated with AL serum. 
Furthermore, mitochondrial function was enhanced in both CR mice and cells 
treated with CR serum. These findings suggest that while CR decreases the 
protein synthesis response, secretory factors present in the blood during CR can 
activate protein synthesis and promote mitochondrial function.

BACKGROUND: Heat is a significant cause of mortality, but impact patterns are 
heterogenous. Previous studies assessing such heterogeneity focused exclusively 
on risk rather than heat-attributable mortality burdens and assume predictors 
are independent.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed how four interrelated regional-level sociodemographic 
predictors-education, life expectancy, the ratio of older to younger people 
(aging index), and relative income-influence heterogeneity in heat-attributable 
mortality burdens in Europe and then derived insights into adaptation 
strategies.
METHODS: We extracted four outcomes from a temperature-mortality study covering 
16 European countries: the rate of increase in mortality risk at moderate and 
extreme temperatures (moderate and extreme slope, respectively), the minimum 
mortality temperature percentile (MMTP), and the underlying mortality rate. We 
used structural equation modeling with country-level random effects to quantify 
the direct and indirect influences of the predictors on the outcomes.
RESULTS: Higher levels of education were directly associated with lower 
heat-related mortality at moderate and extreme temperatures via lower slopes and 
higher MMTPs. A one standard deviation increase in education was associated with 
a - 0.46 ± 0.14, - 0.41 ± 0.12, and 0.41 ± 0.12 standard deviation 
(±standard error) change in the moderate slope, extreme slope, and MMTP, 
respectively. However, education had mixed indirect influences via associations 
with life expectancy, the aging index, and relative income. Higher life 
expectancy had mixed relations with heat-related mortality, being associated 
with higher risk at moderate temperatures (0.33 ± 0.11 for the moderate slope; 
- 0.19 ± 0.097 for the MMTP) but lower underlying mortality rates ( 
- 0.72 ± 0.097). A higher aging index was associated with higher burdens through 
higher risk at extreme temperatures (0.13 ± 0.072 for the extreme slope) and 
higher underlying mortality rates (0.93 ± 0.055). Relative income had relatively 
small, mixed influences.
DISCUSSION: Our novel approach provided insights into actions for reducing the 
health impacts of heat. First, the results show the interrelations between 
possible vulnerability-generating mechanisms and suggest future research 
directions. Second, the findings point to the need for a dual approach to 
adaptation, with actions that explicitly target heat exposure reduction and 
actions focused explicitly on the root causes of vulnerability. For the latter, 
the climate crisis may be leveraged to accelerate ongoing general public health 
programs. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11766.

Effective repair and functional recovery of large peripheral nerve deficits are 
urgent clinical needs. A biofunctional electroactive scaffold typically acts as 
a "bridge" for the repair of large nerve defects. In this study, we constructed 
a biomimetic piezoelectric and conductive aligned polypyrrole (PPy)/polydopamine 
(PDA)/poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) electrospun fibrous scaffold to improve the 
hydrophilicity and cellular compatibility of PLLA and restore the weakened 
piezoelectric effect of PDA, which is beneficial in promoting Schwann cell 
differentiation and dorsal root ganglion neuronal extension and alignment. The 
aligned PPy/PDA/PLLA fibrous scaffold bridged the sciatic nerve of 
Sprague-Dawley rats with a 10 mm deficit, prevented autotomy, and promoted nerve 
regeneration and functional recovery, thereby activating the calcium and 
AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Therefore, electroactive 
fibrous scaffolds exhibit great potential for neural tissue regeneration.

Given the expansion of life expectancy, the aging of the population, and the 
anticipated rise in the number of stroke survivors in Europe with severe 
neurological consequences in the coming decades, stroke is becoming the most 
prevalent cause of functional disability. Therefore, the prognosis for a stroke 
must be timely and precise. Two databases (MEDLINE and Scopus) were searched to 
identify all relevant studies published between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 
2022 that investigated the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and acute 
stroke severity, mortality, and post-hospital prognosis. Only full-text 
English-language articles were included. This review includes Thirty articles 
that were traced and incorporated into the present review. Emerging data 
regarding the potential predictive value of thyroid hormone levels suggests 
there may be a correlation between low T3 syndrome, subclinical hypothyroidism, 
and poor stroke outcome, especially in certain age groups. These findings may 
prove useful for rehabilitation and therapy planning in clinical practice. Serum 
thyroid hormone concentration measurement is a non-invasive, relatively 
harmless, and secure screening test that may be useful for this purpose.

BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease is a rare autosomal recessive glycosphingolipid 
storage disease that ultimately leads to reduced life expectancy. Management of 
Gaucher disease is challenging due to its wide genotypic and phenotypic 
variability and changing clinical manifestations due to effective treatment. 
Deliberation between experts is essential to discuss daily clinical practice and 
identify controversies regarding the management of Gaucher disease. The 
usefulness of methods like Delphi surveys is suitable for setting up consensus 
recommendations for different clinical scenarios.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to develop an expert consensus document 
for the management of type 1 Gaucher disease by local experts.
METHODS: A modified e-Delphi was carried out to develop an expert consensus 
document on the management goals of type 1 Gaucher disease in South Africa. 
Following a literature review and input from the steering committee, 205 
management goals and best practice statements were e-mailed to an independent 
panel for consensus development using three rounds of voting. The panel 
consisted of five local healthcare practitioners with expertise in Gaucher 
disease. Each panelist provided independent evaluations of statements sent to 
them via a dedicated survey platform. Panelists indicated their level of 
agreement on a 9-point Likert scale (1 = absolute disagreement to 9 = absolute 
agreement) during each round of voting. The criteria to retain a statement in 
the final round were ≥80% high agreement (7-9).
RESULTS: 193 statements met the consensus threshold after three rounds of voting 
and were included in the final guidance document. In general, the management 
goals presented in this paper are in line with existing literature on the 
subject. Additional management goals and general recommendations on sound 
clinical practice, obtained from more recent research and the panelists' own 
clinical experience, have been included to develop a comprehensive consensus 
document on the management goals of type 1 Gaucher disease.
CONCLUSION: This paper provides high-level guidance with respect to management 
goals, and the use of current therapies and adjunctive interventions in type 1 
Gaucher disease to assist clinicians in their decisions about the appropriate 
management of patients in everyday clinical practice. These management goals and 
best practice statements might be used to inform an update to future South 
African guidelines on the disease.

In order to develop integrated management approaches for Pectinophora 
gossypiella, basic studies are crucial. The two-sex life table is the most 
important tool for describing the fitness and population parameters of both 
sexes (male and female) of an insect, while the traditional life table only 
explains the female sex of an insect. However, no study has reported on the 
biology of P. gossypiella using two-sex life table tools. Therefore, this study 
explains the rearing dynamics of P. gossypiella on a cotton seed-based 
artificial diet and a natural diet (mature cotton bolls). According to the 
results, the oviposition period of P. gossypiella was recorded to be longer on 
the artificial diet (9.07 ± 0.24) compared to the natural diet (7.40 ± 0.11). 
The total fecundity of P. gossypiella was greater on the artificial diet 
(125.94 ± 3.06) in comparison to the natural diet (60.37 ± 1.10). The population 
parameters, including intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, gross 
reproductive rate, and net reproductive rate of P. gossypiella were highest on 
the artificial diet in comparison to the natural diet. This study concluded that 
the cotton seed-based artificial diet was most suitable for the rearing of P. 
gossypiella. In the future, P. gossypiella may be studied in depth in light of 
the findings in this study.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) has usually been used as a metric to monitor 
population health. In the last few years, metrics such as 
Quality-Adjusted-Life-Expectancy (QALE) and Health-Adjusted-Life- Expectancy 
(HALE) have gained popularity in health research, given their capacity to 
capture health related quality of life, providing a more comprehensive approach 
to the health concept. We aimed to estimate the distribution of the LE, QALEs 
and HALEs across Socioeconomic Status in the Chilean population.
METHODS: Based on life tables constructed using Chiang II´s method, we estimated 
the LE of the population in Chile by age strata. Probabilities of dying were 
estimated from mortality data obtained from national registries. Then, life 
tables were stratified into five socioeconomic quintiles, based on age-adjusted 
years of education (pre-school, early years to year 1, primary level, secondary 
level, technical or university). Quality weights (utilities) were estimated for 
age strata and SES, using the National Health Survey (ENS 2017). Utilities were 
calculated using the EQ-5D data of the ENS 2017 and the validated value set for 
Chile. We applied Sullivan´s method to adjust years lived and convert them into 
QALEs and HALEs.
RESULTS: LE at birth for Chile was estimated in 80.4 years, which is consistent 
with demographic national data. QALE and HALE at birth were 69.8 and 62.4 
respectively. Men are expected to live 6.1% less than women. However, this trend 
is reversed when looking at QALEs and HALEs, indicating the concentration of 
higher morbidity in women compared to men. The distribution of all these metrics 
across SES showed a clear gradient in favour of a better-off population-based on 
education quintiles. The absolute and relative gaps between the lowest and 
highest quintile were 15.24 years and 1.21 for LE; 18.57 HALYs and 1.38 for 
HALEs; and 21.92 QALYs and 1.41 for QALEs. More pronounced gradients and higher 
gaps were observed at younger age intervals.
CONCLUSION: The distribution of LE, QALE and HALEs in Chile shows a clear 
gradient favouring better-off populations that decreases over people´s lives. 
Differences in LE favouring women contrast with differences in HALEs and QALEs 
which favour men, suggesting the need of implementing gender-focused policies to 
address the case-mix complexity. The magnitude of inequalities is greater than 
in other high-income countries and can be explained by structural social 
inequalities and inequalities in access to healthcare.

BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have a lower life 
expectancy than their peers without ID. A contributing factor to the lower life 
expectancy and early mortality could be sarcopenia: low muscle mass and low 
muscle function. In the general population, sarcopenia strongly predicts early 
mortality, but this association is unknown in people with ID. Therefore, this 
study aims to explore the association between sarcopenia and 5-year mortality in 
older adults with ID.
METHODS: In the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disabilities (HA-ID) study, the 
prevalence of sarcopenia was measured at baseline among 884 older adults 
(≥50 years) with ID. All-cause mortality was measured over a 5-year follow-up 
period. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were 
applied to determine the association between sarcopenia (no sarcopenia, 
pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia, severe sarcopenia) and early mortality, adjusted for 
age, sex, level of ID, presence of Down syndrome, and co-morbidity (chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes type 2 and metabolic syndrome).
RESULTS: The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for sarcopenia was 2.28 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.48-3.42], P < 0.001), and 2.40 (95% CI 1.40-4.10, 
P = 0.001) for severe sarcopenia. When adjusted for age, sex, level of ID, and 
Down syndrome, sarcopenia (HR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.08-2.75, P = 0.022) and severe 
sarcopenia (HR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.07-3.23, P = 0.028) were significantly 
associated with early mortality. When additionally adjusted for co-morbidity, 
the adjusted HR decreased to 1.62 (95% CI 1.02-2.59, P = 0.043) and 1.81 (95% CI 
1.04-3.15, P = 0.035) for sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for early mortality in 
older adults with ID over a 5-year follow-up period. Our results stress the need 
to delay the incidence and development of sarcopenia in older adults with ID.

Kale is becoming an important vegetable worldwide, mainly due to its nutritional 
properties. Kale leaves can be marketed whole, although minimal processing is 
also in demand. In this article, it was analyzed the effect of packaging in a 
modified atmosphere of fresh-cut kale leaves stored at 20 °C and 4 °C. Kale 
leaves were cut into 4 × 4 cm strips and stored in low-density polyethylene 
bags. Samples processed in the same way but stored in PVC were used as controls. 
Leaves kept in a modified atmosphere showed a delay in color change with Hue 
values from about 130 to 120 under PMA against 130 to 100 in control group (CTR) 
leaves. Chlorophyll degradation was also delayed in both storage temperatures. 
Samples stored under PMA showed about two times the levels of total chlorophylls 
with respect to CTR samples at the end of the storage. No changes in total sugar 
content were detected during storage and no differences were detected between 
control and modified atmospheres stored samples. Samples maintained in a 
modified atmosphere showed a lower decrement in soluble proteins and a lower 
rate of RUBISCO degradation at both temperatures. The relation of RUBISCO 
content PMA/CTR ranged from 1 to about 3 toward the end of storage No changes in 
phenols content were found when comparing control and treated samples. However, 
flavonoid and the antioxidant contents increased in samples stored in modified 
atmospheres with respect to their controls. We demonstrated that storage in 
modified atmospheres could be an adequate and simple methodology to extend 
postharvest life of this minimally processed product at both ambient and 
refrigerated storage.

AIM: The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the 
cost-effectiveness of switching from a bivalent to a nonavalent human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in Norway, incorporating all nonavalent 
vaccine-preventable HPV-related diseases and in the context of the latest 
cervical cancer screening program.
METHODS: A well-established dynamic transmission model of the natural history of 
HPV infection and disease was adapted to the Norwegian population. We determined 
the number of cases of HPV-related diseases and subsequent number of deaths, and 
the economic burden of HPV-related disease under the current standard of care 
conditions of bivalent and nonavalent vaccinations of girls and boys aged 
12 years.
RESULTS: Compared to bivalent vaccination, nonavalent vaccination averted an 
additional 4,357 cases of HPV-related cancers, 421,925 cases of genital warts, 
and 543 cases of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) over a 100-year time 
horizon. Nonavalent vaccination also averted an additional 1,044 deaths over the 
100-year time horizon when compared with bivalent vaccination. Total costs were 
higher for the nonavalent strategy (10.5 billion NOK [€1.03 billion] vs. 9.3-9.4 
billion NOK [€915-925 million] for bivalent vaccination). A switch to nonavalent 
vaccination had a higher vaccination cost (4.4 billion NOK [€433 million] vs. 
2.7 billion NOK [€266 million] for bivalent vaccination) but resulted in a 
savings of 627-694 million NOK [€62-68 million] in treatment costs. A switch to 
nonavalent vaccination demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
102,500 NOK (€10,086) per QALY versus bivalent vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a model that incorporated the full range of HPV-related 
diseases, and the latest cervical cancer screening practices, we found that 
switching from bivalent to nonavalent vaccination would be considered 
cost-effective in Norway.

Plain Language Summary: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted 
infection that is common in Norway. Vaccination against HPV has substantially 
reduced the burden of HPV-related diseases globally. The HPV vaccine is 
available in bivalent, quadrivalent, and nonavalent forms. The bivalent vaccine 
is currently used in the Norwegian national immunization program, but the 
nonavalent vaccine is also licensed in Norway. In order to gain a more complete 
understanding of the benefits of nonavalent vaccination, it is necessary to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of switching from the bivalent vaccine to the 
nonavalent vaccine in light of the full array of vaccine-preventable diseases, 
including both cervical and noncervical cancers, genital warts, and recurrent 
respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). Our results show that, when the full range of 
HPV-related diseases is considered, nonavalent vaccination would be 
cost-effective relative to bivalent vaccination in Norway. Compared to bivalent 
vaccination, nonavalent vaccination averted an additional 4,357 cases of 
HPV-related cancers, 421,925 cases of genital warts, and 543 cases of RRP over a
