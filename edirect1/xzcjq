PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe adolescents' experiences of participating 
in a health-promoting school-based intervention regarding food and physical 
activity, with a focus on empowering aspects. Method: The school was located in 
a urban disadvantaged community in Sweden, characterized by poorer self-reported 
health and lower life expectancy than the municipality average. Focus group 
interviews with adolescents (29 girls, 20 boys, 14-15 years) and their teachers 
(n = 4) were conducted two years after intervention. Data were categorized using 
qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: A theme was generated, intersecting with all the categories: Gaining 
control over one's health: deciding, trying, and practicing together, in new 
ways, using reflective tools. The adolescents appreciated influencing the 
components of the intervention and collaborating with peers in active learning 
activities such as practicing sports and preparing meals. They also reported 
acquiring new health information, that trying new activities was inspiring, and 
the use of pedometers and photo-food diaries helped them reflect on their health 
behaviours. The adolescents' experiences were also echoed by their 
teachers. Conclusions: To facilitate empowerment and stimulate learning, 
health-promotion interventions targeting adolescents could enable active 
learning activities in groups, by using visualizing tools to facilitate 
self-reflection, and allowing adolescents to influence intervention activities.

AIM: To investigate the mortality patterns on the Southern Adriatic islands of 
Croatia and compare them with those in two, mainly coastal, mainland counties.
METHODS: In this registry-based study we used the official mortality register 
data to analyze the mortality patterns on seven Croatian islands (Brač, Hvar, 
Korčula, Lastovo, Mljet, Šolta, and Vis) and Pelješac peninsula in the 1998-2013 
period and calculated the average lifespan, life expectancy, and standardized 
mortality ratios (SMR). We compared the leading causes of death with those in 
the mainland population of two southernmost Croatian counties.
RESULTS: The average lifespan of the island population was 3-10 years longer for 
men and 2-7 years longer for women than that on the mainland. All-cause SMRs 
were significantly lower for both men and women on Korčula, Brač, Mljet, and 
Pelješac but significantly higher for women on Šolta (1.22; 95% confidence 
intervals 1.07-1.38). The leading causes of death on the islands were 
cardiovascular diseases, with higher percentages in men and lower in women in 
comparison with those on the mainland. There were no substantial differences in 
the life expectancy at birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite longer lifespan, lack of differences in life expectancy at 
birth suggests that the recent generations of islanders no longer show 
beneficial mortality patterns, possibly due to diminishing adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet and lifestyle. Restoring the traditional lifestyles is a 
public health priority, with the ultimate aim of reducing inequalities and 
improving the health of island inhabitants.

BACKGROUND: Reducing lifespan inequality is increasingly recognized as a health 
policy objective. Whereas lifespan inequality declined with rising longevity in 
most developed countries, Danish life expectancy stagnated between 1975 and 1995 
for females and progressed slowly for males. It is unknown how Danish lifespan 
inequality changed, which causes of death drove these developments, and where 
the opportunities for further improvements lie now.
METHODS: We present an analytical strategy based on cause-by-age decompositions 
to simultaneously analyze changes in Danish life expectancy and lifespan 
inequality from 1960 to 2014, as well as current Swedish-Danish differences.
RESULTS: Stagnation in Danish life expectancy coincided with a shorter period of 
stagnation in lifespan inequality (1975-1990). The stagnation in life expectancy 
was mainly driven by increases in cancer and non-infectious respiratory 
mortality at higher ages (-.63 years) offsetting a reduction in cardiovascular 
and infant mortality (+ 1.52 years). Lifespan inequality stagnated because most 
causes of death did not show compression over the time period. Both these 
observations were consistent with higher smoking-related mortality in Danes born 
in 1919-1939. After 1995, life expectancy and lifespan equality increased in 
lockstep, but still lag behind Sweden, mainly due to infant mortality and 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Since 1960, Danish improvements in life expectancy and lifespan 
equality were halted by smoking-related mortality in those born 1919-1939, while 
also reductions in old-age cardiovascular mortality held back lifespan equality. 
The comparison with Sweden suggests that Denmark can reduce inequality in 
lifespans and increase life expectancy through a consistent policy target: 
reducing cancer and infant mortality.

BACKGROUND: Pay-for-performance (P4P) has been recommended as a promising 
strategy to improve implementation of high-quality care. This study examined the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of a P4P strategy found to be highly effective in 
improving the implementation and effectiveness of the Adolescent Community 
Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA), an evidence-based treatment (EBT) for adolescent 
substance use disorders (SUDs).
METHODS: Building on a $30 million national initiative to implement A-CRA in SUD 
treatment settings, urn randomization was used to assign 29 organizations and 
their 105 therapists and 1173 patients to one of two conditions 
(implementation-as-usual (IAU) control condition or IAU+P4P experimental 
condition). It was not possible to blind organizations, therapists, or all 
research staff to condition assignment. All treatment organizations and their 
therapists received a multifaceted implementation strategy. In addition to those 
IAU strategies, therapists in the IAU+P4P condition received US $50 for each 
month that they demonstrated competence in treatment delivery (A-CRA competence) 
and US $200 for each patient who received a specified number of treatment 
procedures and sessions found to be associated with significantly improved 
patient outcomes (target A-CRA). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), 
which represent the difference between the two conditions in average cost per 
treatment organization divided by the corresponding average difference in 
effectiveness per organization, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were the 
primary outcomes.
RESULTS: At trial completion, 15 organizations were randomized to the IAU 
condition and 14 organizations were randomized to the IAU+P4P condition. Data 
from all 29 organizations were analyzed. Cluster-level analyses suggested the 
P4P strategy led to significantly higher average total costs compared to the IAU 
control condition, yet this average increase of 5% resulted in a 116% increase 
in the average number of months therapists demonstrated competence in treatment 
delivery (ICER = $333), a 325% increase in the average number of patients who 
received the targeted dosage of treatment (ICER = $453), and a 325% increase in 
the number of days of abstinence per patient in treatment (ICER = $8.134). 
Further supporting P4P as a cost-effective implementation strategy, the cost per 
QALY was only $8681 (95% confidence interval $1191-$16,171).
CONCLUSION: This study provides experimental evidence supporting P4P as a 
cost-effective implementation strategy.

Lipaphis erysimi (L.) Kaltenbach (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is one of the most 
important pests of brassica crops, mainly causing losses due to sap sucking, 
toxin injection and viral transmission. Knowledge about the main natural factors 
that regulate populations of this pest, as well as its critical mortality stage, 
is crucial for the development of integrated pest management of L. erysimi. 
Here, we determined the critical stage and key mortality factors for L. erysimi 
in cabbage using an ecological life table. Causes of mortality at each stage of 
L. erysimi development were monitored daily in the field for seven seasons. From 
the experimental data, we determined the key factor and critical stage of 
mortality through correlation and regression analyses. The nymphal stage, 
especially first instar nymphs, was critical for L. erysimi mortality. The key 
mortality factors were, in descending order of importance, physiological 
disturbances and predation by Syrphidae, Coccinellidae and Solenopsis ants. 
Therefore, control measures should target early stages of L. erysimi and the use 
of cabbage cultivars that have negative effects against L. erysimi may be a 
promising strategy for its management. Our results may be useful for plant 
geneticists who could develop new cabbage cultivars based on these findings. In 
addition, conservation measures of the main predators of L. erysimi may 
contribute to the natural control of this pest.

Background: The Roma population is one of the major marginalized groups in 
Europe, having higher incidence of all spectrums of disease and a shorter life 
expectancy. Yet, the reasons for higher morbidity and its exact prevalence were 
not properly studied. Objectives: The objective of our study was to compare the 
frequency of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Roma people to the non-Roma population 
in Slovakia, and to compare levels of uric acid and its correlation with 
components of metabolic syndrome. Methods: A group of 452 Roma people aged 18⁻55 
years, was compared to a control group of 403 non-Roma people. The data were 
obtained by questionnaire, anthropometric measures, and analyzed blood and urine 
samples Results: The prevalence of MetS was significantly higher among Roma 
participants (131; 29.6%) compared with non-Roma participants (80; 20.1%), p = 
0.001. Roma people significantly more often fulfilled obesity and low 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) criteria of MetS (257, 58.9% vs. 180, 45.8%, p < 
0.0001, and 312, 70.0% vs. 140, 34.9%, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in 
the triacylglycerols (TG), glycemia or blood pressure (BP) criteria of MetS. The 
Roma also presented with greater levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(hs-CRP). Baseline levels of uric acid (UA) among the Roma population were 
significantly lower compared with the majority population (226.54 ± 79.8 vs. 
259.11 ± 84.53) (p < 0.001). The levels of UA significantly correlated with 
fulfilled criteria of MetS. Univariate regression showed that UA is a 
significant predictor of MetS in the whole cohort (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 
1.005; 95% CI 1.004⁻1.007; p < 0.0001) also after the adjustment for age, sex, 
and ethnicity (adjusted OR 1.008; 95% CI 1.005⁻1.010; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: 
We were able to show that prevalence of MetS among the Roma is higher than in 
the majority population. Moreover, the uric acid levels are significantly lower 
in the Roma group as well as when it comes to a cohort with MetS. Levels of UA, 
besides others, depend on ethnicity, age, and sex.

With the increasing life expectancy and ageing population in Singapore, we are 
likely to see more patients with dementia seeking help from their primary care 
clinicians. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
antagonists for dementia management can be costly given their modest efficacy, 
and it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with patients before a 
shared decision is made. Non-pharmacological management such as regular 
structured routine, good sleep hygiene, reminiscence and other activities are 
also useful in improving the well-being of dementia patients. Caregivers and 
family members can be advised on what to watch out for to keep patients safe at 
home and outdoors, as dementia patients have poor safety awareness. The primary 
care clinician can manage depression, if present, and refer the patient to 
memory clinics or appropriate specialist clinics for further assessment when 
indicated.

BACKGROUND: Recently, molecule-targeting and bone-modifying agents have improved 
the treatment outcomes of lung cancer-derived metastatic spine tumors. 
Therefore, the prognostic factors for such tumors were examined, and novel 
scoring systems for predicting the life expectancy of patients with such tumors 
were proposed.
METHODS: In 207 patients with lung cancer-derived metastatic spine tumors 
(surgery 49; conservative therapy 158), we retrospectively examined the factors 
that influenced the post-treatment survival time (age, sex, the affected site, 
pathology, general condition, the number of extraspinal bone metastases, the 
number of spinal metastases, the presence/absence of major internal organ 
metastasis, paralysis state, the total Tokuhashi score, the serum alkaline 
phosphatase level, the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, molecule-targeting 
drug treatment, and bone-modifying agent treatment). Based on the results, we 
devised novel scoring systems for predicting the prognosis of such patients.
RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that the pathology of the primary lung 
tumor, the patient's general condition and paralysis state, and the 
presence/absence of molecule-targeting drug treatment significantly influenced 
survival. We performed a Cox regression analysis of these four factors and 
developed criteria for a novel scoring system based on the patient's general 
condition and paralysis state, which exhibited significance in the regression 
analysis. A retrospective review indicated that the consistency rate between 
predicted life expectancy and actual survival was 67.3%. When criteria based on 
the four factors that exhibited significance in the univariate analyses were 
adopted, the consistency rate was 76.2%.
CONCLUSION: The patient's general condition and paralysis state, the pathology 
of the primary lung tumor, and molecule-targeting drug treatment influenced 
survival among patients with lung cancer-derived metastatic spine tumors. Novel 
scoring systems based on these four factors were proposed.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Versus 
Proton Therapy for Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

PURPOSE: To compared the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated proton beam 
therapy (PBT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the management 
of stage III-IVB oropharynx cancer (OPC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to compare IMRT with PBT 
for a 65-year-old patient with stage IVA OPSCC. We assumed PBT led to a 25% 
reduction in long-term xerostomia, short-term dysgeusia, and the need for 
gastrostomy tube. Fewer dental complications were also expected with PBT. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated, and value of 
information analyses were performed. The societal willingness-to-pay was defined 
as $100K per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: The ICERs for PBT for favorable human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive OPC 
were $288,000/QALY and $390,000/QALY in the payer perspective (PP) and societal 
perspective, respectively. Under nearly every scenario, PBT was not 
cost-effective, with ICERs above $150,000/QALY in the PP. The ICERs for 
HPV-negative OPC were typically greater than $250K/QALY in both perspectives. 
For HPV-positive patients, the ICER was less than $100,000/QALY in the PP only 
in younger patients who experienced a 50% reduction in both xerostomia and 
gastrostomy use. On probabilistic sensitivity analyses, there were 0% and 0.4% 
probabilities that PBT was cost-effective for 65- and 55-year old patients, 
respectively. The value of information was zero or negligible for all ages and 
perspectives at willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY and only meaningful in the 
PP for younger patients at a willingness-to-pay of $150,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensity modulated proton beam therapy was only cost-effective in 
the PP if assumed to achieve profound reductions in long-term morbidity for 
younger patients; it was never cost-effective in the societal perspective. 
Prospective data are needed (and may be valuable) to better characterize the 
comparative toxicities of these treatments but are unlikely to change this 
calculation, except potentially in the most favorable cohort of patients.

College, New York, NY.

The World Health Organization now recognizes primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma 
(PMBCL) as a unique clinical and biologic entity. PMBCL is distinct from other 
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes and has features that overlap with 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma, including a peak incidence in the adolescent and 
young adult population, mediastinal presentation of disease, and molecular 
alterations in JAK2 and programmed death ligands. Because PMBCL is rare, there 
are few prospective clinical trials to guide therapy, resulting in no single 
standard of care. Given the long life expectancy of survivors of PMBCL, 
treatment approaches must balance maximizing cure while minimizing long-term 
toxicity. In this article, I review my approach to the treatment of PMBCL, 
incorporating data from adult and pediatric studies, as well as recent advances 
in our understanding of the molecular basis of PMBCL.

In vascular plants, there is a clear coupling between traits related to water 
and traits related to carbon economics. For bryophytes this coupling has been 
little studied but is expected to be strong, because in these poikilohydric 
plants photosynthesis varies strongly with water availability. We hypothesized 
that there is a trade-off between water-holding and photosynthetic capacities 
for mosses, resulting in a limited spectrum of possible trait combinations. At 
one end of this spectrum, mosses would tend to stay wet and active for long 
periods but would have slow photosynthetic rates. At the other end, mosses would 
avoid external water and dry out quicker but would have high photosynthetic 
capacities. We determined the water relations (water-holding and -retention 
capacities), photosynthetic water- and light-response curves of shoots of 12 
moss species and explored the associations between these traits and their 
distributions among the studied species. The results partly support our 
hypotheses, in that the water-holding and water-retention capacities of mosses 
are positively related to each other and to the value and width of the optimal 
water-content range for photosynthesis. However, the photosynthetic capacities 
were specific to taxonomic groups, and the relationships between the water 
relations and the photosynthetic capacity are weak or inconsistent and depend 
strongly on the species used for analysis. The positive relationships between 
water-holding, water-retention and photosynthetic water-use capacities suggest 
two contrasting adaptations to avoid damage during dehydration: taking more time 
to 'prepare' or quick photosynthetic adjustment. However, the spectrum we 
hypothesized cannot be generalized for all mosses and defining a broader 
spectrum will require the extension of this study to a much larger number of 
species and including stand-level measurements of water loss and photosynthesis.

University, Bhubaneswar 751030, India.

Cr(VI) exhibits cytotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic properties; hence, 
effluents containing Cr(VI) from various industrial processes pose threat to 
aquatic life and downstream users. Various treatment techniques, such as 
chemical reduction, ion exchange, bacterial degradation, adsorption and 
photocatalysis, have been exploited for remediation of Cr(VI) from wastewater. 
Among these, photocatalysis has recently gained considerable attention. The 
applications of photocatalysis, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, 
pollutant degradation, organic transformation reactions, N2 fixation, etc., 
towards solving the energy crisis and environmental issues are briefly discussed 
in the Introduction of this review. The advantages of TiO2 as a photocatalyst 
and the importance of its modification for photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) 
has also been addressed. In this review, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 
after modification with carbon-based advanced materials, metal oxides, metal 
sulfides and noble metals towards reduction of Cr(VI) was evaluated and compared 
with that of bare TiO2. The photoactivity of dye-sensitized TiO2 for reduction 
of Cr(VI) was also discussed. The mechanism for enhanced photocatalytic activity 
was highlighted and attributed to the resultant properties, namely, effective 
separation of photoinduced charge carriers, extension of the light absorption 
range and intensity, increase of the surface active sites, and higher 
photostability. Advantages and limitations for photoreduction of Cr(VI) over 
modified TiO2 are depicted in the Conclusion. The various challenges that 
restrict the technology from practical applications in remediation of Cr(VI) 
from wastewater were addressed in the Conclusion section as well. The future 
perspectives of the field presented in this review are focused on the 
development of whole-solar-spectrum responsive, TiO2-coupled photocatalysts 
which provide efficient photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) along with their good 
recoverability and recyclability.

High sampling variability complicates estimation of demographic rates in small 
areas. In addition, many countries have imperfect vital registration systems, 
with coverage quality that varies significantly between regions. We develop a 
Bayesian regression model for small-area mortality schedules that simultaneously 
addresses the problems of small local samples and underreporting of deaths. We 
combine a relational model for mortality schedules with probabilistic prior 
information on death registration coverage derived from demographic estimation 
techniques, such as Death Distribution Methods, and from field audits by public 
health experts. We test the model on small-area data from Brazil. Incorporating 
external estimates of vital registration coverage though priors improves 
small-area mortality estimates by accounting for underregistration and 
automatically producing measures of uncertainty. Bayesian estimates show that 
when mortality levels in small areas are compared, noise often dominates signal. 
Differences in local point estimates of life expectancy are often small relative 
to uncertainty, even for relatively large areas in a populous country like 
Brazil.

Reevaluating approaches to cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations.

Commonwealth University, Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU, Richmond, 
Virginia.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by intermittent acute 
episodes of worsening signs, symptoms, and pulmonary function; these so-called 
pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) appear to be important drivers of long-term 
declines in lung function, quality of life, and life expectancy. Surveillance 
for development of PEx and their treatment is a fundamental component of chronic 
CF management, and the merits of novel CF therapies are often judged based on 
their ability to reduce the frequency of PEx. Given the central role that they 
play, it is surprising how poorly PEx are understood, how thin is the evidence 
base for their treatment and how often they are left unrecognized and untreated 
in clinical practice. This paper reviews what is known and what is unknown 
regarding the nature of PEx, and discusses the impact of missed recognition and 
treatment of these episodes as well as the apparent variation in practice across 
CF care centers. The arguments supporting a liberal, highly sensitive approach 
to the diagnosis of PEx are presented, as well as recommendation for how care 
programs can achieve consistency in their early recognition and treatment. A 
stepwise approach to personalized treatment supported by close follow-up to 
ensure the successful resolution of all signs and symptoms will lead to the 
stabilization of patients' lung function and quality of life. Recommendations 
are made regarding important priorities for research into evidence-based 
approaches to improving the care of PEx.

cost-effectiveness thresholds and internal reference pricing: combining the best 
of both worlds?

The efficiency-frontier approach (EFA) to health economic evaluation aims to 
benchmark the relative efficiency of new drugs with the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of non-dominated comparators. By explicitly 
considering any differences in health outcomes and costs, it enhances the 
internal reference pricing (IRP) policy that was officially endorsed by Germany 
as the first country worldwide in 1989. However, the EFA has been repeatedly 
criticized since its official endorsement in 2009. Areas covered: This 
perspective aims to stimulate the debate by discussing whether the main 
objections to the EFA are technically valid, irrespective of national contextual 
factors in Germany with reservations towards using cost-per-quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) thresholds. Moreover, we comparatively assessed whether the 
objections are truly unique to the EFA or apply equally to IRP and 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. Expert commentary: The plethora of objections to 
the EFA (n = 20) has obscured that many objections are neither technically valid 
nor unique to the EFA. Compared with cost-effectiveness thresholds, only two 
objections apply uniquely to the EFA and concern intended key properties: (1) no 
external thresholds are needed and (2) the EFA is sensitive to price changes of 
comparators. Combining these policies and developing them further are 
under-utilized research areas.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic impact of introducing the prostate health 
index (phi) for prostate cancer (PCa) detection.
METHODS: A total of 177 patients who presented in an academic institution with a 
tPSA between 2 and 10 ng/ml and underwent prostate biopsies within the 3 months 
were enrolled. With phi and tPSA thresholds of 43 and 4 ng/ml, respectively, 
probability for each branch of a decision tree model for PCa diagnosis and 
corresponding mean cost were estimated with "Monte Carlo" simulations. A 
sensitivity analysis was performed.
RESULTS: With a similar sensitivity, phi strategy increased positive predictive 
value by 13.9 points and negative predictive value by 31.6 points in comparison 
to tPSA strategy. Mean costs per patient with tPSA and phi strategies were €514 
and €528, respectively, for a phi test price at 50€. One-way sensitivity 
analysis showed that phi strategy was less expensive (508€/patient) than tPSA 
strategy with a phi test price below 30€. In multi-criteria sensitivity 
analysis, PPV and the rates of positive phi and tPSA were the parameters with 
the largest impact on the final cost as opposed to the cost of the biopsy or 
imaging which have less influence. With an expected rate of positive phi test 
< 60%, tPSA strategy was more expensive than phi strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of phi index in PCa detection would result in a 
significant clinical benefit compared to tPSA strategy. In our economic model, 
the phi strategy was equivalent or slightly more expensive than the current tPSA 
strategy.

BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine (GEM), oxaliplatin plus GEM (OX + GEM), cisplatin plus 
GEM (CIS + GEM), capecitabine plus GEM (CAP + GEM), FOLFIRINOX (FFX), and 
nab-paclitaxel plus GEM (NAB-P + GEM) are the most commonly used regimens as 
first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) in the UK. 
Independent economic evaluation of these regimens simultaneously has not been 
conducted for the UK.
OBJECTIVE: Using data from a network meta-analysis as efficacy measures, we 
estimated the cost effectiveness and cost utility of these regimens for the UK.
METHODS: A three-state Markov model (progression-free, progressed-disease, and 
death) simulating the total costs and health outcomes (quality-adjusted 
life-years [QALYs] gained and life-years [LYs]) was developed to estimate the 
incremental cost-utility (ICUR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) 
for patients with MPC, from the payer perspective. The model was specified to 
calculate total costs in 2017 British pounds (GBP, £). All values were 
discounted at 3.5% per year over a full lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of 
parameter uncertainty on the results.
RESULTS: FFX was the most effective regimen, NAB-P + GEM was the most costly 
regimen, and GEM was the least costly and least effective regimen. OX + GEM, 
CIS + GEM, and NAB-P + GEM were dominated by CAP + GEM and FFX. Compared with 
GEM, the ICUR for CAP + GEM and FFX was £28,066 and £33,020/QALY gained, 
respectively; compared with GEM, the ICER for CAP + GEM and FFX was £17,437 and 
£22,291/LY gained, respectively; and compared with CAP + GEM, the ICUR and ICER 
for FFX were £34,947/QALY gained and 24,414/LY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: At a threshold value of £30,000/QALY, CAP + GEM was found to be the 
only cost-effective regimen in the management of MPC in the UK.

INTRODUCTION: Oral metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are very rare, 
and predominate in the mandible. We report an exceptional case of maxillary 
metastasis revealing HCC.
CASE REPORT: A 56-year-old man with a previous medical history of alcohol abuse 
presented to our department with a 3-week evolving oral mass. Physical 
examination showed a left maxillary tumor. The biopsy revealed a HCC and a 
multi-metastatic HCC with portal thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism was 
discovered following a CT-scan. A state of advanced malnutrition contraindicated 
sorafenib chemotherapy. Thus, external irradiation was proposed, without 
success. The patient subsequently died 50 days later.
DISCUSSION: Maxillary HCC metastases are extremely rare. The average age of HCC 
jaw metastases appearance in patients has been reported to be approximately 57 
years, men are more affected than women are, and the mean life expectancy is 12 
months following the diagnosis. These patients require palliative treatment. 
Local recurrences occur very early after possible surgery, and expose the 
patient to life-threatening bleeding.

BACKGROUND: Due to difficulties in predicting recurrences in colorectal cancer 
stages II and III, reliable prognostic biomarkers could be a breakthrough for 
individualized treatment and follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: To find potential prognostic protein biomarkers in colorectal cancer, 
using the proximity extension assays.
METHODS: A panel of 92 oncology-related proteins was analyzed with proximity 
extension assays, in plasma from a cohort of 261 colorectal cancer patients with 
stage II-IV. The survival analyses were corrected for disease stage and age, and 
the recurrence analyses were corrected for disease stage. The significance 
threshold was adjusted for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: The plasma proteins expression levels had a greater prognostic 
relevance in disease stage III colorectal cancer than in disease stage II, and 
for overall survival than for time to recurrence. Osteoprotegerin was the only 
biomarker candidate in the protein panel that had a statistical significant 
association with overall survival (P = .00029). None of the proteins were 
statistically significantly associated with time to recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the 92 analyzed plasma proteins, osteoprotegerin showed the 
strongest prognostic impact in patients with colorectal cancer, and therefore 
osteoprotegerin is a potential predictive marker, and it also could be a target 
for treatments.

BACKGROUND: Responders to induction treatment sustain continuous clinical 
response (CCR) through 1 year in about 50% of patients in PURSUIT-M trial with 
golimumab maintenance in ulcerative colitis (UC). This post hoc analysis of 
PURSUIT-M describes the 1-year clinical, endoscopic, quality of life (QoL), and 
biomarker and 4-year clinical outcome in patients with sustained response to 
golimumab therapy for UC.
METHODS: We compared clinical, endoscopic, QoL, and calprotectin outcomes in CCR 
and non-CCR patients through 54 weeks in PURSUIT-M. Persistence on golimumab 
therapy and clinical response at 4 years was assessed for CCR and non-CCR 
patients. The relationship of colectomy with CCR status was determined.
RESULTS: Among patients receiving golimumab maintenance, greater proportions of 
patients with vs without CCR at week 54 achieved clinical remission (67.1% vs 
1.9%), corticosteroid-free remission (61.6% vs 1.9%), endoscopic remission (Mayo 
endoscopy score 0 [47.9% vs 1.3%]), and normal QoL (inflammatory bowel disease 
questionnaire score ≥170 [75.0% vs 24.4%]). CCR but not non-CCR patients 
maintained normalized calprotectin levels during maintenance. Among patients who 
entered the long-term extension study, a greater proportion of patients with vs 
without CCR maintained PGA 0 through week 216 (58% vs 42%). Colectomy was 
performed in 47 induction nonresponders and in 13 induction responders. None of 
the patients going onto colectomy achieved CCR through 54 weeks in PURSUIT-M.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous clinical response is associated with favorable short- 
and long-term clinical, endoscopic, QoL, and biomarker responses that may result 
in changing the course of disease and may prevent colectomy in patients with 
moderate to severe UC treated with golimumab.

Comparing Older Persons' Human Rights: Exploratory Study of the International 
Older Persons' Human Rights Index (IOPHRI).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Over the last 2 decades, several international 
indices have been developed to describe the status of older persons. None, 
however, have examined their human rights. The International Older Persons' 
Human Rights Index (IOPHRI) fills in this gap by analyzing the formal 
legislative foundation of human rights for older people. The objective of this 
exploratory study is to examine the IOPHRI while comparing the legislation in 6 
countries.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A comparative international exploratory study 
comparing the human rights legislation of 6 countries: United States, Chile, 
Ireland, South Africa, India, and Australia in 5 different human rights domains: 
constitutional, protection, familial and informal support, planning, and 
empowerment.
RESULTS: The findings suggest that the actual relationship between formal human 
rights of older persons and the real world is complex: for example, while the 
IOPHRI index places South Africa in first place, it is far behind compared with 
all other participants in the Global AgeWatch Index (which measures objective 
elements such as life expectancy at 60, or poverty rates in old age).
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Measuring and indexing human rights of older 
persons reveal significant methodological issues. Beyond these methodological 
challenges, comparing the ranking of the IOPHRI to nonlegalistic indices raises
