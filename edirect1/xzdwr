Biological modeling for anti-cancer treatments using mathematical models can be 
very supportive in gaining more insight into dynamic processes responsible for 
cellular response to treatment, and predicting, evaluating and optimizing 
therapeutic effects of treatment. This review presents an overview of the 
current status of biological modeling for hyperthermia in combination with 
radiotherapy (thermoradiotherapy). Various distinct models have been proposed in 
the literature, with varying complexity; initially aiming to model the effect of 
hyperthermia alone, and later on to predict the effect of the combined 
thermoradiotherapy treatment. Most commonly used models are based on an 
extension of the linear-quadratic (LQ)-model enabling an easy translation to 
radiotherapy where the LQ model is widely used. Basic predictions of cell 
survival have further progressed toward 3 D equivalent dose predictions, i.e., 
the radiation dose that would be needed without hyperthermia to achieve the same 
biological effect as the combined thermoradiotherapy treatment. This approach, 
with the use of temperature-dependent model parameters, allows theoretical 
evaluation of the effectiveness of different treatment strategies in individual 
patients, as well as in patient cohorts. This review discusses the significant 
progress that has been made in biological modeling for hyperthermia combined 
with radiotherapy. In the future, when adequate temperature-dependent 
LQ-parameters will be available for a large number of tumor sites and normal 
tissues, biological modeling can be expected to be of great clinical importance 
to further optimize combined treatments, optimize clinical protocols and guide 
further clinical studies.

OBJECTIVES: To determine age-matched death rates of current and retired elite 
male Australian football players (Australian and/or Victorian Football League) 
with the general population.
DESIGN: Analysis of publicly-available birth, debut and death data for all 
Australian Victorian Football/Victorian Football League players who debuted 
prior to (and were still alive at) the start of 1971 or debuted 1971-2020.
METHODS: Wikipedia was used to source the dates of death (or record that the 
player was alive in 2021) for the cohort. New players became part of the cohort 
for analysis on debut and existing cohort members left it at death. Actual death 
rates (per year and per decade) were then compared to expected deaths, based on 
age-specific population death rates.
RESULTS: There were 5400 players and ex-players in the cohort at the start of 
1971 (average age 47.3) and a further 4532 players debuted between 1971 and 2020 
inclusive (a total of 9932 players). The expected deaths for the cohort in this 
50-year period were 4955, but only 3914 deaths occurred (Standardized Mortality 
Ratio 0.79, 95 %CI 0.76-0.82). For younger members of the cohort (age <50) the 
discrepancy between expected (222) and actual (98) deaths was also significant 
(Standardized Mortality Ratio 0.44, 95 %CI 0.35-0.56).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the death rates of elite male Australian 
footballers are lower than the reference general population, similar to other 
studies of elite athletes. Some of this may be explained by "healthy cohort" 
selection bias, a limitation which affects almost all studies in this genre.

BACKGROUND: Femoral hernias often present with incarceration or strangulation 
that requires emergency surgery. However, recommendations vary regarding optimal 
approaches for incarcerated femoral hernia. The aim of this study is to compare 
clinical efficacy between mesh repair and suture repair for the treatment of 
incarcerated femoral hernia.
METHODS: Retrospective, single-center analysis of the clinical data from 48 
patients with incarcerated femoral hernia, including 16 patients who underwent 
mesh repair (mesh repair group) and 32 patients who underwent traditional suture 
repair (suture repair group).
RESULTS: The mean age, body mass index, incarceration duration, hernia sac size, 
operation duration, and the rates of postoperative incision infection, 
recurrence, chronic pain, and mortality were not significantly different between 
the suture repair and mesh repair groups (P > 0.05 for all). In contrast, the 
female/male ratio; the rates of bowel obstruction, coexisting diseases, and 
nighttime operation; and the American Society of Anesthesiologists grade were 
higher and the rate of prophylactic antibiotic use and the mean cost of 
hospitalization were lower in the suture repair group than in the mesh repair 
group (P < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: The surgical approach should be chosen based on the patient's 
condition. Mesh repair for the emergency treatment of incarcerated femoral 
hernia is safe and effective, whereas suture repair is suitable for elderly 
patients, those with more coexisting diseases, and those with limited life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Hair loss causes significant psychosocial distress to patients. 
Health utility measurements offer an objective, quantitative assessment of 
health-related quality of life (QOL).
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study on patients with hair loss 
between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Patient metrics were compared 
with layperson perception of alopecia, prospectively collected between August 1 
and December 31, 2017. Health utility measures were quantified using the visual 
analog scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time trade-off (TTO) in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and relative to the minimal clinically 
important difference (MCID). Bonferroni correction to the significance threshold 
was performed.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with alopecia were compared with 237 laypeople. 
Patient metrics for female hair loss were all significantly lower than laypeople 
measures (VAS QALYs 0.65 ± 0.21 vs. 0.83 ± 0.18, p = 0.0001). Mean SG QALYs were 
lower for patients in the male alopecia state (0.86 ± 0.23 vs. 0.96 ± 0.12, 
p = 0.0278). Post-hair transplant improvement in TTO was significantly greater 
for patients (+ 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. + 0.02 ± 0.09, p = 0.0070) and significantly 
more often exceeded the MCID (45.2% vs. 16.9%, p = 0.0006).
CONCLUSIONS: Alopecia negatively impacts QOL, and the true patient experience is 
more taxing than what is perceived by laypeople. Hair transplantation improves 
QOL more for male patients than common perception.

Saponins cause mortality in insects by reducing food absorption and movement in 
the gut, which may be used to exploit the control of insect pests. In the 
current study, tea seed saponin (TSS) was extracted and then added to the 
artificial diets of Helicoverpa armigera. Pre-ovipositional period of the 
TSS-treated individuals increased while longevity and fecundity decreased 
compared to control. There was a significant reduction of the treated 
individuals in the life table parameters of TSS-treated Individuals including 
net reproduction rate (R0 ), intrinsic rate of population increase (r), finite 
rate of increase (λ), and gross reproduction rate (GRR). Also, we found that 
saponin suppressed the immune system by reducing the total hemocyte count, 
immune-related gene expression, and phenoloxidase activity. Our results 
demonstrated a lower expression of cecropin gene in the treated larvae with TSS 
while no significant differences were observed in attacin gene. Our results 
clearly showed that feeding of H. armigera larvae in the diet containing TSS 
significantly reduced demographic parameters, forced insects to obtain more time 
to complete one generation, and caused vulnerabilities against pathogens. These 
discrepancies alleviated nutrient uptake of the larvae and disrupted their 
feeding and growth. Hence, a proper formulation with a desirable concentration 
would be prepared and applied in the fields suffering H. armigera damage to 
monitor insecticidal efficiency of TSS.

Background: Cystinosis is a multisystemic disease caused by the accumulation of 
cystine crystals in the kidney and many other organs. This disease most often 
involves children. Recent developments in the treatment procedures have improved 
the chance of patients surviving as long as puberty. This study discusses the 
importance of immediate diagnosis and early treatment of the disease with 
cystagon, which reduces gastrointestinal complications in such patients. 
Methods: This descriptive study was performed on 19 adult patients (over 18 
years old) with cystinosis who were observed by nephrologists from medical 
universities throughout Iran. Gastrointestinal complications were studied in the 
patients. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 22. Results: The mean age of 
patients at the time of enrollment was 23.89 ± 5.06 years. Seventeen (89.4%) 
patients of this group had received renal replacement therapy (3 dialysis, 14 
renal transplantation) due to end-stage renal disease and 2 (10.5%) of them were 
in stages 2 and 3 of chronic kidney disease. Three patients (15.7%) had 
hepatomegaly and splenomegaly; liver enzymes were normal in all patients. One 
patient (5.2%) had increased portal vein flow velocities, 2 of the patients 
(10.5%) underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy implantation due to severe 
dysphagia and eventually died. Most gastrointestinal symptoms in patients were 
nausea and abdominal pain. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment with the 
proper dose of cystagon can increase life expectancy, reduce complications, and 
improve the patient's quality of life.

K+ channels allow selective permeation of K+, but not physiologically abundant 
Na+, at almost diffusion limit rates. The conduction mechanism of K+ channels is 
still controversial, with experimental and computation studies supporting two 
distinct conduction mechanisms: either with or without water inside the channel. 
Here, we employ a bottom-up approach on hydrated alkali metal complexes of a 
model peptide of K+ channels, Ac-Tyr-NHMe, to characterize metal-peptide, 
metal-water, and water-peptide interactions that govern the selectivity of K+ 
channels at a molecular level. Both the extension to the series of alkali metal 
ions and to temperature-dependent studies (approaching physiological values) 
have revealed the clear difference between permeable and non-permeable ions in 
the spectral features of the ion complexes. Furthermore, the impact of hydration 
is discussed in relation to the K+ channels by comparisons of the non-hydrated 
and hydrated complexes.

Primary cilia, microtubule-based protrusions present on the surface of most 
mammalian cells, function as sensory organelles that monitor extracellular 
signals and transduce them into intracellular biochemical responses. There is 
renewed research interest in primary cilia due to their essential roles in 
development, tissue homeostasis, and human diseases. Primary cilia dysfunction 
causes a large spectrum of human diseases, collectively known as ciliopathies. 
Despite significant advances in our understanding of primary cilia, there are 
still no effective agents for treating ciliopathies. Primary ciliogenesis is a 
highly ordered process involving membrane trafficking, basal body maturation, 
vesicle docking and fusion, transition zone assembly, and axoneme extension, in 
which actin and microtubule networks play critical and multiple roles. Actin and 
microtubule network architecture, isotropy, and dynamics are tightly controlled 
by cytoskeleton-associated proteins, a growing number of which are now 
recognized as responsible for cilium formation and maintenance. Here we 
summarize the roles of actin and microtubules and their associated proteins in 
primary ciliogenesis and maintenance. In doing so, we highlight that targeting 
cytoskeleton-associated proteins may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the 
treatment of ciliopathies.

AIMS: High fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) is an independent risk factor for 
several adverse health outcomes and has become a serious public health problem. 
We aimed to evaluate the spatial pattern and temporal trend of disease burden 
attributed to HFPG from 1990 to 2019 using data from the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from GBD 2019, we estimated the numbers and 
age-standardized rates of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
attributed to HFPG by calendar year, age, gender, country, region, 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), and specific causes. The joinpoint regression 
analysis was used to assess the temporal trends of deaths and DALYs from 1990 to 
2019.
RESULTS: In 2019, globally, the numbers of deaths and DALYs attributable to HFPG 
were approximately 6.50 million and 172.07 million, respectively, with 
age-standardized rates of 83.00 per 100,000 people and 2104.26 per 100,000 
people, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the global numbers of deaths and DALYs 
attributed to HFPG have over doubled. The age-standardized rate of DALYs showed 
an increasing trend, particularly in males and in regions with middle SDI or 
below. The leading causes of the global disease burden attributable to HFPG in 
2019 were diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney 
disease.
CONCLUSIONS: HFPG is an important contributor to increasing the global and 
regional disease burden. Necessary measures should be taken to curb the growing 
burden attributed to HFPG, particularly in males and in regions with middle SDI 
or below.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most unprecedented global 
challenge in recent times. As the global community attempts to manage the 
pandemic in the long term, it is pivotal to understand what factors drive 
prevalence rates and to predict the future trajectory of the virus.
OBJECTIVE: This study had 2 objectives. First, it tested the statistical 
relationship between socioeconomic status and COVID-19 prevalence. Second, it 
used machine learning techniques to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in a 
multicountry sample of 182 countries. Taken together, these objectives will shed 
light on socioeconomic status as a global risk factor of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: This research used exploratory data analysis and supervised machine 
learning methods. Exploratory analysis included variable distribution, variable 
correlations, and outlier detection. Following this, the following 3 supervised 
regression techniques were applied: linear regression, random forest, and 
adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). Results were evaluated using k-fold 
cross-validation and subsequently compared to analyze algorithmic suitability. 
The analysis involved 2 models. First, the algorithms were trained to predict 
2021 COVID-19 prevalence using only 2020 reported case data. Following this, 
socioeconomic indicators were added as features and the algorithms were trained 
again. The Human Development Index (HDI) metrics of life expectancy, mean years 
of schooling, expected years of schooling, and gross national income were used 
to approximate socioeconomic status.
RESULTS: All variables correlated positively with the 2021 COVID-19 prevalence, 
with R2 values ranging from 0.55 to 0.85. Using socioeconomic indicators, 
COVID-19 prevalence was predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Using 
2020 reported case rates as a lone predictor to predict 2021 prevalence rates, 
the average predictive accuracy of the algorithms was low (R2=0.543). When 
socioeconomic indicators were added alongside 2020 prevalence rates as features, 
the average predictive performance improved considerably (R2=0.721) and all 
error statistics decreased. Thus, adding socioeconomic indicators alongside 2020 
reported case data optimized the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence to a 
considerable degree. Linear regression was the strongest learner with R2=0.693 
on the first model and R2=0.763 on the second model, followed by random forest 
(0.481 and 0.722) and AdaBoost (0.454 and 0.679). Following this, the second 
model was retrained using a selection of additional COVID-19 risk factors 
(population density, median age, and vaccination uptake) instead of the HDI 
metrics. However, average accuracy dropped to 0.649, which highlights the value 
of socioeconomic status as a predictor of COVID-19 cases in the chosen sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that socioeconomic status is an important variable 
to consider in future epidemiological modeling, and highlights the reality of 
the COVID-19 pandemic as a social phenomenon and a health care phenomenon. This 
paper also puts forward new considerations about the application of statistical 
and machine learning techniques to understand and combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: High body mass index (BMI) plays a key role in the progression of 
asthma and asthma related to high BMI resulted in a high burden of disease 
globally.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the geographic and temporal trends in the global burden of 
asthma associated with high BMI from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis with data based on the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2019 database. Deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) 
were estimated according to sex, age, and sociodemographic index levels. The 
estimated annual percentage change was used to evaluate the variation trends of 
ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of global asthma deaths and DALYs related to high 
BMI increased by 69.69% and 63.91%, respectively, compared with 1990, among 
which more deaths and DALYs occurred in women. The corresponding ASMR and ASDR 
exhibited a slightly decreasing tendency globally. South Asia accounted for the 
highest number of deaths and DALYs, with India ranking first worldwide in 2019. 
The number of deaths and DALYs were mainly seen in individuals 60 to 79 years 
old and 55 to 69 years old, respectively, from 1990 to 2019. The heaviest burden 
existed in the low-middle sociodemographic index region.
CONCLUSION: The global asthma burden associated with obesity increased in 
absolute value but the standardized burden decreased slightly. Large variations 
existed in the high BMI-related asthma burdens among sexes, ages, and regions.

BACKGROUND: Younger women's engagement with gambling has changed over recent 
decades due to a range of socio-cultural, environmental and commercial factors. 
However, younger women's distinct lived experiences with gambling have rarely 
been considered. The following critical qualitative inquiry explored factors 
that influenced younger women's engagement with gambling and their perceptions 
of gambling risks.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 41 Australian women aged 
18-40 years. Participants were asked questions relating to their reasons for 
gambling, and the perceived risks associated with gambling. Reflexive thematic 
analysis was used to interpret the data.
RESULTS: Five themes were constructed from the data. First, women reported that 
they gambled to escape their everyday lives, with some women reporting gambling 
within their own homes. Second, women reported gambling for financial reasons, 
particularly to change their life circumstances and outcomes. Third, gambling 
was used by women as a way to connect with social network members. Fourth, 
gambling was an incidental activity that was an extension of non-gambling 
leisure activities. Finally, lower risk perceptions of participants' own 
gambling risk contributed to their engagement and continuation of gambling.
CONCLUSION: Public health and health promotion initiatives should recognise that 
young women's gambling practices are diverse, and address the full range of 
socio-cultural, environmental and commercial factors that may influence younger 
women's engagement with gambling.

Non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) is defined as a complex disorder 
involving structural, biomechanical, cognitive, psychological, social, and 
lifestyle factors. Non-pharmacological approaches such as exercise and physical 
therapy have been proposed in first-line treatments, along with psychological 
follow-up and pain medication if needed. Our objective was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of an intensive rehabilitation program with HUBER (a multi-axis 
motorized platform equipped with force sensors, allowing patients to perform 
physical exercises in an isometric mode) on the spine flexion-to-extension ratio 
at 60 and 120°/s, pain, and trunk flexibility in individuals with NSCLBP. Twelve 
participants underwent a clinical evaluation including isokinetic spine strength 
and participated in a 6-week rehabilitation program with HUBER 360 Evolution. 
The main findings of this pilot study show that the flexor/extensor ratios at 
60°, the flexibility of the hamstring and quadriceps, and muscular endurance of 
the trunk, disability, and quality of life were significantly improved at the 
end of the rehabilitation program (p < 0.05). Low back pain and analgesic 
medication were also reduced. Exercising with the HUBER Platform seems to be 
effective in managing NSCLBP but a randomized study with a larger sample size 
and a control group is necessary.

Worldwide, honey bees are increasingly faced with periods of pollen scarcity, 
which can lead to nutritional deficiencies, especially of proteins and amino 
acids. These are essential for the proper functioning of the single organism and 
the colony. To understand how bees react to protein deficiency, under controlled 
conditions, we studied the effect of pollen deficiency on the main physiological 
parameters in two subspecies endemic of Algeria, Apis mellifera intermissa and 
Apismellifera sahariensis. Emerging workers of both subspecies were reared with 
two diets: one was pollen-fed, whereas the other pollen-deprived. Several 
physiological criteria were measured depending on the type of diet and 
subspecies: the survival of the bees, the amount of total protein in the 
hemolymph, hypopharyngeal glands development and the ovary development of 
workers. These last three parameters were assessed at three different ages (7, 
14 and 21 days). At birth, sahariensis workers weighed more than intermissa. 
With the same protein diet, the average life expectancy of sahariensis was 
extended by 5.55 days compared to intermissa. Even if deprived of pollen, 
sahariensis lived longer than intermissa fed with pollen (p < 0.001). In the 
three age levels, the hypopharyngeal glands were more developed and less 
affected by pollen deficiency (p < 0.001) in sahariensis than in intermissa (p < 
0.001). The total hemolymph protein was higher in intermissa than in sahariensis 
regardless of the diet, and was also higher in protein-fed than in deprived bees 
(p < 0.001). The ovaries developed more rapidly with a high proportion in 
intermissa than in sahariensis (p < 0.05) regardless of the diet, and was also 
higher in the bees fed with pollen than those deprived (p < 0.05). Pollen 
deficiency generates physiological alterations and modifications, the amplitude 
of which varied according to the subspecies of the bee studied.

OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to compare the incidence of adverse cardiovascular 
(CV) events in older adults with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) treated with 
parathyroidectomy versus nonoperative management.
BACKGROUND: PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is associated with 
increased CV mortality, but it is not known whether parathyroidectomy reduces 
the incidence of adverse CV events.
METHODS: The authors conducted a population-based, longitudinal cohort study of 
Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PHPT (2006-2017). Multivariable, inverse 
probability weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine 
the associations of parathyroidectomy with major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACEs), CV disease-related hospitalization, and CV hospitalization-associated 
mortality.
RESULTS: The authors identified 210,206 beneficiaries diagnosed with PHPT from 
2006 to 2017. Among 63,136 (30.0%) treated with parathyroidectomy and 147,070 
(70.0%) managed nonoperatively within 1 year of diagnosis, the unadjusted 
incidence of MACE was 10.0% [mean follow-up 59.1 (SD 35.6) months] and 11.5% 
[mean follow-up 54.1 (SD 34.0) months], respectively. In multivariable analysis, 
parathyroidectomy was associated with a lower incidence of MACE [hazard ratio 
(HR): 0.92; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.90-0.94], CV disease-related 
hospitalization (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.87-0.91), and CV hospitalization-associated 
mortality (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.71-0.81) compared to nonoperative management. At 
10 years, parathyroidectomy was associated with adjusted absolute risk reduction 
for MACE of 1.7% (95% CI: 1.3%-2.1%), for CV disease-related hospitalization of 
2.5% (95% CI: 2.1%-2.9%), and for CV hospitalization-associated mortality of 
1.4% (95% CI: 1.2%-1.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based cohort study, parathyroidectomy was 
associated with a lower long-term incidence of adverse CV outcomes when compared 
with nonoperative management for older adults with PHPT, which is relevant to 
surgical decision making for patients with a long life expectancy.

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease due to a deficiency in the 
activity of the lysosomal-galactosidase A (GalA), a key enzyme in the 
glycosphingolipid degradation pathway. FD is a complex disease with a poor 
genotype-phenotype correlation. In the early stages, FD could involve the 
peripheral nervous system (acroparesthesias and dysautonomia) and the ski 
(angiokeratoma), but later kidney, heart or central nervous system impairment 
may significantly decrease life expectancy. The advent of omics technologies 
offers the possibility of a global, integrated and systemic approach well-suited 
for the exploration of this complex disease. In this narrative review, we will 
focus on the main metabolomic studies, which have underscored the importance of 
detecting biomarkers for a diagnostic and prognostic purpose in FD. These 
investigations are potentially useful to explain the wide clinical, biochemical 
and molecular heterogeneity found in FD patients. Moreover, the quantitative 
mass spectrometry methods developed to evaluate concentrations of these 
biomarkers in urine and plasma will be described. Finally, the complex metabolic 
biomarker profile depicted in FD patients will be reported, which varies 
according to gender, types of mutations, and therapeutic treatment.

The H2-based membrane biofilm reactor (H2-MBfR) has been acknowledged as a 
cost-effective microbial reduction technology for oxyanion removal from drinking 
water sources, but it remains unknown how the evolution of biofilm 
characteristics responds to the changing critical operating parameters of the 
H2-MBfR for simultaneous bromate (BrO3-) and nitrate (NO3-) elimination. 
Therefore, an expanded multispecies model, applicable to mechanistically 
interpret the bromate-reducing bacteria (BRB)- and denitrifying bacteria 
(DNB)-dominated metabolic processes in the biofilm of the H2-MBfR, was developed 
in this study. The model outputs indicate that (1) increased BrO3- loading 
facilitated the metabolism of BRB by increasing BRB fraction and BrO3- gradients 
in the biofilm, but had a marginal influence on NO3- reduction; (2) H2 pressure 
of 0.04 MPa enabled the minimal loss of H2 and the extension of the active 
region of BRB and DNB in the biofilm; (3) once the influent NO3- concentration 
was beyond 10 mg N/L, the fraction and activity of BRB significantly declined; 
(4) BRB was more tolerant than DNB for the acidic aquatic environment incurred 
by the CO2 pressure over 0.02 MPa. The results corroborate that the degree of 
microbial competition for substrates and space in the biofilm was dependent on 
system operating parameters.

Anxiety following myocardial infarction: A systematic review of psychological 
interventions.

OBJECTIVE: Anxiety is highly prevalent following myocardial infarction (MI) and 
is linked with adverse effects on a person's recovery, quality of life, physical 
health, and life expectancy. The primary objective of this systematic review was 
to assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions for anxiety following 
MI.
METHOD: CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and 
Web of Science were systematically searched for studies that provided 
information on anxiety pre and post psychological intervention following MI.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included (15 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] 
and three non-RCTs). Within these studies, psychological interventions comprised 
cognitive behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, 
counseling, psychotherapy, psychological/psychosocial cardiac rehabilitation, 
illness perception interventions, relaxation training, mindfulness, stress 
management, and other psychological-based programmes. Ten studies reported a 
significant decrease in anxiety following a psychological intervention, when 
compared with usual care. Three studies noted mixed results, and five studies 
reported no significant difference in anxiety following a psychological 
intervention. The interventions varied in length, setting, facilitation, and 
format. Poor reporting of information increased the risk of bias within studies.
CONCLUSION: Psychological interventions may be beneficial to individuals who 
experience anxiety following a MI. No particular type of psychological 
intervention appears to be superior to others within the existing literature. 
Further rigorous research is needed to identify the needs of this population and 
the specific form of psychological intervention that is most effective in 
alleviating anxiety following MI. Clinical implications and recommendations for 
future research are provided. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights

Earlier this year, when I was confirmed as the new commissioner of the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), the world faced ongoing public health issues 
related to the pandemic and war in Ukraine, among other challenges. Most 
notably, the US is experiencing a flattening or decline in life expectancy 
compared with other high-income countries. As part of a wider effort to reverse 
this decline, relationships between FDA and the biomedical ecosystem should be 
reimagined to facilitate more effective translation of science into successful 
health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common 
malignancy of the skin, often occurring in older patients and in the head and 
neck area (cSCCHN). Age, life expectancy, and frailty are not taken into 
consideration by current guidelines.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of frailty 
and life expectancy on guideline deviation, treatment outcomes, and quality of 
life (QoL) after treatment in patients with cSCCHN.
METHODS: Patients with cSCCHN were prospectively included. A geriatric 
assessment was performed, including the Geriatric 8 (G8), Groningen Frailty 
Indicator, and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). The Lee index was used to predict a 
limited life expectancy, and the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 was used as a 
comorbidity index. QoL was assessed by the Basal and Squamous cell carcinoma 
Quality of Life (BaSQoL) questionnaire at three time points.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients with cSCCHN were included. Frail patients had 
significantly more high-risk tumours. Guideline deviation occurred in 7.8% and 
was more common in patients who were frail (G8), with high-risk tumours (≥T2), 
with a limited life expectancy or an increased TUG. Guideline deviation did not 
lead more often to progression of disease in our study. No predictors for 
post-operative complications were found. BaSQoL subscores were very low at each 
time point and did not change significantly with time in the total group. Frail 
patients reported more fear of recurrence or new tumours 3 months after
