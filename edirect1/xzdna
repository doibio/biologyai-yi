timely and regular treatment to patients with childhood cancers such as 
retinoblastoma. This study is aimed at assessing the demography, clinical 
presentation, treatment strategies, and outcome of treatment defaulters due to 
the lockdown.
METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational study of retinoblastoma patients at a 
tertiary care ocular oncology center during the first wave of COVID-19 and the 
resulting nationwide lockdown.
RESULTS: Of the 476 eyes of 326 patients undergoing active management with a 
median age of 57 months (range: 4-214 months), 205 (63%) patients returned for 
follow-up after a mean delay of 45.8 ± 24.3 weeks (range: 8-80 weeks) and 121 
(37%) were defaulters according to the data analyzed till June 30, 2021. 
Distance of residence was ≥1000 km for 148 patients (46%). In terms of need for 
active treatment, the number of emergent cases was 2 (<1%), 11 (3%) were urgent, 
and 313 (96%) were semi-urgent. International classification groups D (n = 107 
eyes, 23%) and E (n = 173 eyes, 36%) were in majority, and 13 eyes (4%) and 4 
eyes (1%) were at stages 3 and 4, respectively. Prior to lockdown, 86 eyes (18%) 
had active tumor, which remained unchanged (n = 26, 30%) or worsened (n = 49, 
60%) after failure to follow-up. Vision (47%), eye (92%), and life salvage (98%) 
were achieved by individualized protocol-based management after the patients 
returned for further management. Five children succumbed to intracranial 
extension.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19-related nationwide lockdown has deprived retinoblastoma 
patients of optimal and timely management, leading to prolonged treatment 
interruptions, delays, permanent default, and death. It is of paramount 
importance for all the stakeholders to increase awareness, make necessary travel 
and logistic arrangements, and ensure continuity of care for children with 
retinoblastoma.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive malignancy of the brain and 
spinal cord with a poor life expectancy. The low survivability of GBM patients 
can be attributed, in part, to its heterogeneity and the presence of multiple 
genetic alterations causing rapid tumor growth and resistance to conventional 
therapy. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats 
(CRISPR)-CRISPR associated (Cas) nuclease 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system is a 
cost-effective and reliable gene editing technology, which is widely used in 
cancer research. It leads to novel discoveries of various oncogenes that 
regulate autophagy, angiogenesis, and invasion and play important role in 
pathogenesis of various malignancies, including GBM. In this review article, we 
first describe the principle and methods of delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 genome 
editing. Second, we summarize the current knowledge and major applications of 
CRISPR-Cas9 to identifying and modifying the genetic regulators of the hallmark 
of GBM. Lastly, we elucidate the major limitations of current CRISPR-Cas9 
technology in the GBM field and the future perspectives. CRISPR-Cas9 genome 
editing aids in identifying novel coding and non-coding transcriptional 
regulators of the hallmarks of GBM particularly in vitro, while work using in 
vivo systems requires further investigation.

Areas.

The possible interconnection between the eye and central nervous system (CNS) 
has been a topic of discussion for several years just based on fact that the eye 
is properly considered an extension of the brain. Both organs consist of neurons 
and derived from a neural tube. The visual process involves photoreceptors that 
receive light stimulus from the external environment and send it to retinal 
ganglionic cells (RGC), one of the cell types of which the retina is composed. 
The retina, the internal visual membrane of the eye, processes the visual 
stimuli in electric stimuli to transfer it to the brain, through the optic 
nerve. Retinal chronic progressive neurodegeneration, which may occur among the 
elderly, can lead to different disorders of the eye such as glaucoma, 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Mainly in 
the elderly population, but also among younger people, such ocular pathologies 
are the cause of irreversible blindness or impaired, reduced vision. Typical 
neurodegenerative diseases of the CSN are a group of pathologies with common 
characteristics and etiology not fully understood; some risk factors have been 
identified, but they are not enough to justify all the cases observed. 
Furthermore, several studies have shown that also ocular disorders present 
characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases and, on the other hand, CNS 
pathologies, i.e., Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD), which are 
causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, show peculiar alterations at the 
ocular level. The knowledge of possible correlations could help to understand 
the mechanisms of onset. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of these 
heterogeneous disorders are still debated. This review discusses the 
characteristics of the ocular illnesses, focusing on the relationship between 
the eye and the brain. A better comprehension could help in future new 
therapies, thus reducing or avoiding loss of vision and improve quality of life.

Symbolic play is considered an early indicator in the diagnosis of autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) and its assessment. The objective of this study was to 
analyze the difficulties in symbolic play experienced by children with ASD and 
to determine the existence of differences in symbolic play among children with 
ASD, children with other neurodevelopmental disorders and children with typical 
development. A scoping review was carried out in the Web of Science (WoS), 
Scopus, ERIC, and PsycInfo databases, following the extension for scoping 
reviews of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The number of papers included in the review 
was 22. The results confirm that children with ASD have greater difficulties 
with symbolic play than children with other neurodevelopmental disorders and 
children with typical development, even when controlling for their verbal age. 
Difficulties are greater in situations of free or spontaneous play. Results 
evidenced that the absence or deficiency in the symbolic play can serve as an 
early indicator of ASD between the first and second year of life, the 
developmental moment in which this type of play begins.

The development of food-borne and infectious diseases has increased globally at 
an anomalous rate and is combined with emerging social and economic problems. 
This highlights the need for new and improved antibacterial agents with novel 
and different mechanisms of action at regular intervals. Some chemical or 
artificial food additives are considered harmful if they are used beyond their 
permissible levels. Today, consumers are demanding alternative, green, safer, 
and natural food additives to increase the shelf life of food. Essential oils 
(EOs) are concentrated liquid mixtures of volatile compounds with antioxidant 
and antibacterial properties that can be used as natural, eco-friendly, 
renewable, and cost-effective additives. The use of combinations of different 
EOs and their components is a promising strategy to increase the synergistic and 
additive effects of EOs in foods. In this article, we review the recent 
literature on EOs concerning the chemical constituents, extraction methods, 
antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and their mechanisms of action. 
Additionally, we discuss the synergistic interaction of different EOs and their 
components, challenges, and future directions of EOs as natural food 
preservatives, with special emphasis on shelf life extension and applications in 
the packaging of food products.

Oral cancer continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide, and its 
prevalence is particularly high in developing countries, where people chew 
tobacco and betel nut on a regular basis. Radiation-, chemo-, targeted-, 
immuno-, and hormone-based therapies along with surgery are commonly used as 
part of a treatment plan. However, these treatments frequently result in various 
unwanted short- to long-term side effects. As a result, there is an urgent need 
to develop treatment options for oral cancer that have little or no adverse 
effects. Numerous bioactive compounds derived from various plants have recently 
attracted attention as therapeutic options for cancer treatment. Antioxidants 
found in medicinal plants, such as vitamins E, C, and A, reduce damage to the 
mucosa by neutralizing free radicals found in various oral mucosal lesions. 
Phytochemicals found in medicinal plants have the potential to modulate cellular 
signalling pathways that alter the cellular defence mechanisms to protect normal 
cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. 
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of various medicinal plants 
and phytoconstituents that have shown the potential to be used as oral cancer 
therapeutics.

Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (ISCMs) are infrequent lesions. Their 
incidence is estimated to range from 0.9 to 2.1%, found in autopsies of cancer 
patients. However, as the life expectancy of malignant tumour patients 
constantly increases, the reported incidences of ISCMs are consequently rising. 
This report presents a case of the misdiagnosis of an anaplastic astrocytoma 
type of tumour due to its similarities to small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. 
Therefore, we would like to underline the importance of further investigation 
that could assist and support the surgeon in the making of the differential 
diagnosis. We present the clinical case of a 73-year-old woman with a solitary 
intramedullary spinal cord metastasis as the initial manifestation of a 
carcinoid type of tumour. The patient was admitted to our department while 
presenting a rapid onset of paraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging was 
performed, which showed an intramedullary mass at the C2-C6 vertebral level with 
a heterogeneous contrast enhancement. In light of these findings, the patient 
underwent surgery for a partial tumour resection. The lesion resulted in being a 
small-cell neuroendocrine type of carcinoma. This peculiar type of tumour 
presents similar radiological characteristics to the anaplastic astrocytoma 
type, which is why our diagnostical mismatch occurred. This is the report of a 
rare case of solitary intramedullary spinal cord metastasis, which is the result 
of an initial presentation of a lung small-cell neuroendocrine type of 
carcinoma. We conclude that ISCMs should be regularly considered as a part of 
the differential diagnosis of intramedullary lesions, especially in the case of 
a rapid onset and deterioration of neurological symptoms.

Mental activity in sleep often involves visual and auditory content. 
Chemosensory (olfactory and gustatory) experiences are less common and 
underexplored. The aim of the study was to identify olfaction-related factors 
that may affect the occurrence of chemosensory dream content. Specifically, we 
investigated the effects of all-night exposure to an ambient odour, 
participants' appraisal of their current olfactory environment, their general 
propensity to notice odours and act on them (i.e., odour awareness), and their 
olfactory acuity. Sixty pre-screened healthy young adults underwent olfactory 
assessment, completed a measure of odour awareness, and spent three nights in 
weekly intervals in a sleep laboratory. The purpose of the first visit was to 
adapt to the experimental setting. On the second visit, half of them were 
exposed to the smell of vanillin or thioglycolic acid and the other half to an 
odourless control condition. On the third visit, they received control or 
stimulation in a balanced order. On each visit, data were collected twice: once 
from the first rapid eye movement (REM) stage that occurred after 3 a.m., and 
then shortly before getting up, usually from a non-REM stage. Participants were 
asked to report the presence of sensory dream content and to assess their 
current olfactory environment. Neither exposure, nor participants' assessments 
of the ambient odour, or olfactory acuity affected reports of chemosensory dream 
content but they were more frequent in individuals with greater odour awareness. 
This finding may have implications for treatment when such experiences become 
unwanted or bothersome.

Canine and feline cognitive dysfunction syndrome is a common neurodegenerative 
disorder of old age and a natural model of human Alzheimer's disease. With the 
unavoidable expanding life expectancy, an increasing number of small animals 
will be affected. Although there is no cure, early detection and intervention 
are vitally important to delay cognitive decline. Knowledge of cellular and 
molecular mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression is an equally 
decisive factor for developing effective approaches. Uncontrolled 
neuroinflammation, orchestrated in the central nervous system mainly by 
astrocytes, microglia, and resident mast cells, is currently acknowledged as a 
hallmark of neurodegeneration. This has prompted scientists to find a way to 
rebalance the altered crosstalk between these cells. In this context, great 
emphasis has been given to the role played by the expanded endocannabinoid 
system, i.e., endocannabinoidome, because of its prominent role in physiological 
and pathological neuroinflammation. Within the endocannabinoidome, great 
attention has been paid to palmitoylethanolamide due to its safe and 
pro-homeostatic effects. The availability of new ultramicronized formulations 
highly improved the oral bioavailability of palmitoylethanolamide, paving the 
way to its dietary use. Ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide has been 
repeatedly tested in animal models of age-related neurodegeneration with 
promising results. Data accumulated so far suggest that supplementation with 
ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide helps to accomplish successful brain 
aging.

Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, 
generally has a favorable clinical course. Early MF typically presents 
erythematous patches and/or plaques and lasts for many years without affecting 
the life expectancy. Only limited cases progress to develop skin tumors, with 
subsequent lymph nodes and rarely visceral organ involvement. One of the 
clinical problems in early MF is the difficulty in differentiating the disease 
from benign inflammatory disorders (BIDs), such as atopic dermatitis, chronic 
eczema, and psoriasis. In some MF cases, clinical and pathological findings are 
similar to those of BIDs. However, the accurate diagnosis of early MF is quite 
important, as inappropriate treatment including immunosuppressants can cause 
unfavorable or even fatal outcomes. This article focuses on general methods and 
novel tools for diagnosis of early MF.

In this study, we investigated the anti-obesity properties of the novel peptide 
Ala-Gly-Leu-Gln-Phe-Pro-Val-Gly-Arg (AGL9), isolated from the enzymatic 
hydrolysate of Allomyrinadichotoma larvae. To investigate the preventive effects 
of AGL9 against hepatic steatosis and its possible mechanisms of action, we 
established an nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model by feeding C57BL/6 
mice a high-fat diet. NAFLD mice were administered 100 mg/kg AGL9 and 60 mg/kg 
orlistat via gavage (10 mL/kg) for 5 weeks, followed by the collection of blood 
and liver tissues. We found that AGL9 normalized the levels of serum alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, triglyceride, total cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein (LDL)/LDL, adiponectin, 
and leptin in these mice. Additionally, AGL9 activated the protein-level 
expression of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
phosphorylation and the transcript-level expression of sterol regulatory 
element-binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, superoxide dismutase, 
glutathione peroxidase, glucocorticoid receptor, nuclear respiratory factor 2, 
tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 in hepatocytes. These results showed that AGL9 
exhibited hepatoprotective effects by attenuating lipid deposition, oxidative 
stress, and inflammation via inhibition of AMPK/Nrf2 signaling, thereby reducing 
the production of hepatic proinflammatory mediators and indicating AGL9 as a 
potential therapeutic strategy for NAFLD.

Hybrid sturgeon, a popular commercial fish, plays important role in the 
aquaculture in China, while its spoilage during storage significantly limits the 
commercial value. In this study, the specific spoilage organisms (SSOs) from ice 
stored-sturgeon fillet were isolated and identified by analyzing their spoilage 
related on sensory change, microbial growth, and biochemical properties, 
including total volatile base nitrogen (TVBN), thiobarbituric acid reactive 
substances (TBARS), and proteolytic degradation. In addition, the effect of the 
SSOs on the change of volatile flavor compounds was evaluated by solid phase 
microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The 
results showed that the Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas mandelii, and 
Shewanella putrefaciens were the main SSOs in the ice stored-sturgeon fillet, 
and significantly affect the odors by changing the volatile compounds in the 
sturgeon. Compared with the fresh sturgeon, the appreciable increase of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and tetramethyl-pyrazine might be the spoilage 
indicators of the sturgeon contaminated by P. fluorescens; the appreciable 
increase of 1-octen-3-ol and (z)-2-penten-1-o might be the potential marker of 
the sturgeon contaminated by P. mandelii; and the appreciable increase of 
1-(3,3-dimethylbicyclo [2.2.1] hept-2-yl)-ethanon and butylated hydroxytoluene 
were associated with S. putrefaciens. This study reveals the relationship 
between the SSOs and flavor changes in sturgeon fillets, which will contribute 
to the sturgeon preservation and shelf-life extension.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility of reducing changes in the 
quality of consumer hen eggs by storing them in various package type and under 
various temperature conditions (room and refrigeration). The material consisted 
of 960 chicken eggs packed in cardboard or plastic boxes, 10 pcs in each. Half 
of the packages were stored at room temperature (21 °C), the rest in the 
refrigerator (5 °C). The eggs were stored for 28 days qualitatively evaluated at 
14-day intervals. The characteristics of whole egg (weight, specific weight, 
proportion of morphological elements, air cell depth) as well as of shell 
(weight, color, crushing strength, thickness, density, water conductivity), 
albumen (height, Haugh units, weight, pH) and yolk (weight, color, pH) were 
analyzed. The fatty acids profile of yolks was also evaluated as a freshness 
indicator. Packaging types available on the market, apart from its marketing and 
eggs protection function, can also influence the quality and stability of the 
product during storage. The use of plastic boxes can help to maintain higher 
eggs quality during the storage period, even after a significant extension of 
the storage time. Eggs stored in plastic boxes at room temperature had very 
similar results to those stored under refrigeration using conventional cardboard 
boxes. This effect is probably related to the lower permeability of plastic 
boxes in comparison to cardboard ones, but detailed research work in this 
direction is necessary to verify this relation.

Freshly squeezed apple juice was subjected to air non-thermal plasma treatment 
to investigate the capability of this processing method to inactivate 
microorganisms and to evaluate its safety when applied to liquid food products. 
Two different configurations of a transient spark discharge in ambient air were 
tested: an electrospray system with the juice flowing directly through the high 
voltage needle electrode, and a batch system, where the discharge was generated 
onto the surface of the juice. The key physico-chemical parameters of the juice, 
such as pH, conductivity, color, transmittance, and Brix degree, did not 
significantly change upon treatment. The concentration of nitrate ions formed by 
the plasma was safe, while that of nitrite ions and hydrogen peroxide was 
initially higher than the safety limits, but decreased within 24 h post 
treatment. The plasma effect on individual natural components of the juice, such 
as sugars, organic acids, and polyphenols, treated in water solutions led to 
their partial or substantial decomposition. However, when these compounds were 
plasma-treated altogether in the juice, they remained unaffected. The 
antimicrobial effect of the plasma processing was evaluated via the inoculation 
of model microorganisms. A stronger (6 log) decontamination was detected for 
bacteria Escherichia coli with respect to yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Plasma 
processing led to a substantial extension of the juice shelf-life by up to 26 
days if refrigerated, which represents a promising application potential in food 
technology.

Bee pollen is a nutrient-rich food that meets the nutritional requirements of 
honey bees and supports human health. This study aimed to provide nutritive 
composition data for 11 popular bee pollen samples (Brassica napus (Bn), Bidens 
pilosa var. radiata (Bp), Camellia sinensis (Cs), Fraxinus griffithii (Fg), 
Prunus mume (Pm), Rhus chinensis var. roxburghii (Rc), Bombax ceiba (Bc), 
Hylocereus costaricensis (Hc), Liquidambar formosana (Lf), Nelumbo nucifera 
(Nn), and Zea mays (Zm)) in Taiwan for the global bee pollen database. 
Macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, were analyzed, 
which revealed that Bp had the highest carbohydrate content of 78.8 g/100 g dry 
mass, Bc had the highest protein content of 32.2 g/100 g dry mass, and Hc had 
the highest lipid content of 8.8 g/100 g dry mass. Only the bee pollen Hc 
completely met the minimum requirements of essential amino acids for bees and 
humans, and the other bee pollen samples contained at least 1-3 different 
limiting essential amino acids, i.e., methionine, tryptophan, histidine, valine, 
and isoleucine. Regarding the fatty acid profile of bee pollen samples, palmitic 
acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), 
and linolenic acid (C18:3) were predominant fatty acids that accounted for 
66.0-97.4% of total fatty acids. These data serve as an indicator of the 
nutritional quality and value of the 11 bee pollen samples.

Patients under dialysis are known to be more vulnerable to frailty, a dynamic 
geriatric syndrome defined as a state of vulnerability to stressors, due to 
numerous metabolic changes. With rise of life expectancy globally, it is 
important to understand the complexity of the pathophysiology of frailty and 
identify possible markers that can help with the prognosis and diagnosis of 
frailty. The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of the 
knowledge regarding clinical and biochemical markers associated with pre-frailty 
and frailty in dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. In November 2020, PubMed, 
Embase and Web of Science were searched. Studies regarding biomarkers associated 
with (pre-)frailty in (pre-)dialysis patients were included. This systematic 
review identified clinical and biochemical markers in pre-frail and frail 
patients under dialysis or pre-dialysis published in the literature. This study 
shows that more investigation is necessary to identify markers that can 
differentiate these processes to be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in 
routine care and management of geriatric needs. Interventions that can improve 
health outcomes in pre-frail and frail older adults under dialysis or 
pre-dialysis are essential to improve not only the individual's quality of life 
but also to reduce the burden to the health systems.

Existing electronic devices will quickly become e-waste when encountering 
technological iterations, which results in serious environmental and public 
health problems. Previous circular economy research has mainly focused on the 
development of new products with long life or recycling discarded products. This 
study firstly proposes the Green-Extension Design (GED) strategy for developing 
adaptable accessories that provide existing products with the ability to 
continue to work in a different context. Competitiveness was selected to 
evaluate the performance of GED, and three competitiveness components were 
derived through principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, AHP (Analytic 
Hierarchy Process) was applied to define the weights of the three 
competitiveness components, and a GED model was established on the basis of 
production function. Furthermore, the calculation method for each 
competitiveness component was defined. The GED strategy is aimed at extending 
the life of existing products, as well as reducing resource waste and 
environmental pollution. The GED model based on competitiveness components can 
enable enterprises to design products of high competitiveness and obtain market 
share as a result.

Air pollutants include toxic particles and gases emitted in large quantities 
from many different combustible materials. They also include particulate matter 
(PM) and ozone, and biological contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which 
can penetrate the human airway and reach the bloodstream, triggering airway 
inflammation, dysfunction, and fibrosis. Pollutants that accumulate in the lungs 
exacerbate symptoms of respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma, a heterogeneous disease with 
complex pathological mechanisms, is characterized by particular symptoms such as 
shortness of breath, a tight chest, coughing, and wheezing. Patients with COPD 
often experience exacerbations and worsening of symptoms, which may result in 
hospitalization and disease progression. PM varies in terms of composition, and 
can include solid and liquid particles of various sizes. PM concentrations are 
higher in urban areas. Ozone is one of the most toxic photochemical air 
pollutants. In general, air pollution decreases quality of life and life 
expectancy. It exacerbates acute and chronic respiratory symptoms in patients 
with chronic airway diseases, and increases the morbidity and risk of 
hospitalization associated with respiratory diseases. However, the mechanisms 
underlying these effects remain unclear. Therefore, we reviewed the impact of 
air pollutants on airway diseases such as asthma and COPD, focusing on their 
underlying mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: Demographic forecasts indicate the progressive aging process of 
societies in all countries worldwide. The extension of life span may be 
accompanied by deterioration of its quality resulting from a decrease in 
physical activity, mental or even social performance, and a deficit in certain 
chemical compounds responsible for proper functioning of the body.
AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of a 12-week Nordic 
walking (NW) training intervention on the level of vitamin D in the blood and 
quality of life among women aged 65-74 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised 37 women aged 65-74 (x = 68.08, SD = 
4.2). The subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups: experimental group (NW), 
which consisted of 20 women who underwent an intervention in the form of Nordic 
walking training for 12 weeks, and the control group (C), including 17 women who 
underwent observation. In the experimental group, training sessions were held 3 
times a week for 1 h. At that time, the C group was not subject to any 
intervention. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure quality of life. 
Vitamin D was assessed based on the results of biochemical blood tests. The 
analysed parameters were assessed twice-before and after the completed 
intervention or observation.
RESULTS: Comparison of the results regarding trials 1 and 2 allowed to note 
statistically significant improvement in quality of life for all health 
components and factors in the NW group. Analysis of vitamin D levels 
demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the NW group. In group C, 
no significant changes in the analysed parameters were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Regularly undertaking Nordic walking training significantly 
influences the improvement of self-evaluation regarding the components of 
physical and mental health, as well as the concentration of vitamin D in women 
aged 65-74 years.

Meningiomas represent the most common benign histological tumor of the central 
nervous system. Usually, meningiomas are intracranial, showing a typical dural 
tail sign on brain MRI with Gadolinium, but occasionally they can infiltrate the 
skull or be sited extracranially. We present a systematic review of the 
literature on extracranial meningiomas of the head and neck, along with an 
emblematic case of primary extracranial meningioma (PEM), which provides further 
insights into PEM management. A literature search according to the PRISMA 
statement was conducted from 1979 to June 2021 using PubMed, Web of Science, 
Google Scholar, and Scopus databases, searching for relevant Mesh terms (primary 
extracranial meningioma) AND (head OR neck). Data for all patients were recorded 
when available, including age, sex, localization, histological grading, 
treatment, possible recurrence, and outcome. A total of 83 published studies 
were identified through PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases, together 
with additional references list searches from 1979 to date. A total of 49 papers 
were excluded, and 34 manuscripts were considered for this systematic review, 
including 213 patients. We also reported a case of a 45-year-old male with an 
extracranial neck psammomatous meningioma with sizes of 4 cm × 3 cm × 2 cm. 
Furthermore, whole-body 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT was performed, excluding tumor 
spread to other areas. Surgical resection of the tumor was accomplished, as well 
as skin flap reconstruction, obtaining radical removal and satisfying wound 
healing. PEMs could suggest an infiltrative and aggressive behavior, which has 
never found a histopathological correlation with a malignancy (low Ki-67, <5%). 
Whole-body 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT should be considered in the patient's global 
assessment. Surgical removal is a resolutive treatment, and the examination of 
frozen sections can confirm the benignity of the lesion, reducing the extension 
of the removal of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor.

The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan Province, in China, in 
December 2019, spreading rapidly around the world. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) declared this pandemic at the beginning of March 2020 and, at the same 
time, the first patient in Galați County was confirmed. Both the global and the 
regional epidemiological evolutions have taken place with variations in 
incidence, which have been graphically recorded in several "waves". We conducted 
a retrospective study on cases of COVID-19 infection, hospitalized between March 
and June 2020 in an infectious diseases clinic from Galati, in the south-east of 
Romania. The present paper describes the "first-wave" regional epidemiological 
and clinical-biological features and the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. A 
poor outcome was related to late presentation to hospital, old age, and over six 
comorbid conditions including Alzheimer's disease. The high death rate among 
people from long-term care institutions is the consequence of the cumulative 
risk factors associated with immune senescence and inflammation, while COVID-19 
is more likely a contributing factor to lower life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease due to a 
deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal α-galactosidase A (GalA), a key 
enzyme in the glycosphingolipid degradation pathway. FD is a complex disease 
with a poor genotype-phenotype correlation. FD could involve kidney, heart or 
central nervous system impairment that significantly decreases life expectancy. 
The advent of omics technologies offers the possibility of a global, integrated 
and systemic approach well-suited for the exploration of this complex disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six plasmas of FD patients from the French Fabry 
cohort (FFABRY) and 60 control plasmas were analyzed using liquid chromatography 
and mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics (188 metabolites) along with 
the determination of LysoGb3 concentration and GalA enzymatic activity. 
Conventional univariate analyses as well as systems biology and machine learning 
methods were used.
RESULTS: The analysis allowed for the identification of discriminating metabolic 
profiles that unambiguously separate FD patients from control subjects. The 
analysis identified 86 metabolites that are differentially expressed, including 
62 Glycerophospholipids, 8 Acylcarnitines, 6 Sphingomyelins, 5 Aminoacids and 5 
Biogenic Amines. Thirteen consensus metabolites were identified through 
network-based analysis, including 1 biogenic amine, 2 lysophosphatidylcholines 
and 10 glycerophospholipids. A predictive model using these metabolites showed 
an AUC-ROC of 0.992 (CI: 0.965-1.000).
CONCLUSION: These results highlight deep metabolic remodeling in FD and confirm 
the potential of omics-based approaches in lysosomal diseases to reveal clinical 
and biological associations to generate pathophysiological hypotheses.
