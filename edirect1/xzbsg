RESULTS: The overall DALYs of type 2 diabetes was 5.36 per 1000 population, 
which was higher in women (5.49 per 1000) than in men (5.24 per 1000), The 
population in urban area had higher DALYs (5.47 per 1000) than those in rural 
area (5.42 per 1000). The DALYs in old population was high, which peaked in age 
group 80-84 years (32.63 per 1000) with YLL/YLD of 0.62. The disease burden of 
type 2 diabetes was mainly caused by disability.
CONCLUSION: The YLL of type 2 diabetes in Zhejiang was higher than the national 
average level.

BACKGROUND: Many glaucoma referrals from the community to hospital eye services 
are unnecessary. Imaging technologies can potentially be useful to triage this 
population.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness of 
imaging technologies as triage tests for identifying people with glaucoma.
DESIGN: Within-patient comparative diagnostic accuracy study. Markov economic 
model comparing the cost-effectiveness of a triage test with usual care.
SETTING: Secondary care.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults referred from the community to hospital eye services for 
possible glaucoma.
INTERVENTIONS: Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT), including two diagnostic 
algorithms, glaucoma probability score (HRT-GPS) and Moorfields regression 
analysis (HRT-MRA); scanning laser polarimetry [glaucoma diagnostics (GDx)]; and 
optical coherence tomography (OCT). The reference standard was clinical 
examination by a consultant ophthalmologist with glaucoma expertise including 
visual field testing and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Diagnostic performance of imaging, using data from 
the eye with most severe disease. (2) Composite triage test performance (imaging 
test, IOP measurement and visual acuity measurement), using data from both eyes, 
in correctly identifying clinical management decisions, that is 'discharge' or 
'do not discharge'. Outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: Data from 943 of 955 participants were included in the analysis. The 
average age was 60.5 years (standard deviation 13.8 years) and 51.1% were 
females. Glaucoma was diagnosed by the clinician in at least one eye in 16.8% of 
participants; 37.9% of participants were discharged after the first visit. 
Regarding diagnosing glaucoma, HRT-MRA had the highest sensitivity [87.0%, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 80.2% to 92.1%] but the lowest specificity (63.9%, 95% 
CI 60.2% to 67.4%) and GDx had the lowest sensitivity (35.1%, 95% CI 27.0% to 
43.8%) but the highest specificity (97.2%, 95% CI 95.6% to 98.3%). HRT-GPS had 
sensitivity of 81.5% (95% CI 73.9% to 87.6%) and specificity of 67.7% (95% CI 
64.2% to 71.2%) and OCT had sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI 69.2% to 83.4%) and 
specificity of 78.5% (95% CI 75.4% to 81.4%). Regarding triage accuracy, triage 
using HRT-GPS had the highest sensitivity (86.0%, 95% CI 82.8% to 88.7%) but the 
lowest specificity (39.1%, 95% CI 34.0% to 44.5%), GDx had the lowest 
sensitivity (64.7%, 95% CI 60.7% to 68.7%) but the highest specificity (53.6%, 
95% CI 48.2% to 58.9%). Introducing a composite triage station into the referral 
pathway to identify appropriate referrals was cost-effective. All triage 
strategies resulted in a cost reduction compared with standard care 
(consultant-led diagnosis) but with an associated reduction in effectiveness. 
GDx was the least costly and least effective strategy. OCT and HRT-GPS were not 
cost-effective. Compared with GDx, the cost per QALY gained for HRT-MRA is 
£22,904. The cost per QALY gained with current practice is £156,985 compared 
with HRT-MRA. Large savings could be made by implementing HRT-MRA but some 
benefit to patients will be forgone. The results were sensitive to the triage 
costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated imaging can be effective to aid glaucoma diagnosis among 
individuals referred from the community to hospital eye services. A model of 
care using a triage composite test appears to be cost-effective.
FUTURE WORK: There are uncertainties about glaucoma progression under routine 
care and the cost of providing health care. The acceptability of implementing a 
triage test needs to be explored.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting patients with 
life-limiting illness use medicines inappropriately and unnecessarily. In this 
context, the perspective of patients, their carers and the healthcare 
professionals responsible for prescribing and monitoring their medication is 
important for developing deprescribing strategies. The aim of this study was to 
explore the lived experience of patients, carers and healthcare professionals in 
the context of medication use in life-limiting illness.
METHODS: In-depth interviews, using a phenomenological approach: methods of 
transcendental phenomenology were used for the patient and carer interviews, 
while hermeneutic phenomenology was used for the healthcare professional 
interviews.
RESULTS: The study highlighted that medication formed a significant part of a 
patient's day-to-day routine; this was also apparent for their carers who took 
on an active role-as a gatekeeper of care-in managing medication. Patients 
described the experience of a point in which, in their disease journey, they 
placed less importance on taking certain medications; healthcare professionals 
also recognize this and refer it as a 'transition'. This point appeared to occur 
when the patient became accepting of their illness and associated life 
expectancy. There was also willingness by patients, carers and healthcare 
professionals to review and alter the medication used by patients in the context 
of life-limiting illness.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to develop deprescribing strategies for patients 
with life-limiting illness. Such strategies should seek to establish patient 
expectations, consider the timing of the discussion about ceasing treatment and 
encourage the involvement of other stakeholders in the decision-making progress.

In two experiments, participants were exposed to a listing of actions performed 
by a fictitious Mr. X, over three days of his life. For most of his actions an 
outcome was described, but some were not followed by any outcome. On Day 3, Mr. 
X performed an action (the target action) that was followed by a novel outcome. 
For participants in the control condition, the target action that preceded the 
appearance of this outcome was also novel; for participants in the latent 
inhibition (LI) condition, Mr. X had performed the target action on repeated 
occasions during Days 2 and 3, without it producing any outcome. All the 
participants were tested on their ability to retrieve the action performed by 
Mr. X prior to the target outcome. In Experiment 1, retrieval of the target 
action (indicating a less effective target action-outcome association) was 
poorer in the LI than in the control condition. In Experiment 2, reducing the 
proportion (the density) of nontarget actions that brought outcomes during 
initial training was found to reduce the size of the LI effect. These results 
are predicted by the account of LI put forward previously [Hall, G., & 
Rodríguez, G. (2010). Associative and nonassociative processes in latent 
inhibition: An elaboration of the Pearce-Hall model. In R. E. Lubow & I. Weiner 
(Eds.), Latent inhibition: Data, theories, and applications to schizophrenia 
(pp. 114-136). Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press]. A high density 
of predictive relationships ensures strong activation of the expectancy that 
some outcome will occur when the target action is first presented; this 
facilitates the formation of a target action-no-event association during 
training in the LI condition, thus enhancing the LI effect.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United 
States and places substantial burden on the health care system. Rural 
populations, especially women, have considerably higher rates of cardiovascular 
disease, influenced by poverty, environmental factors, access to health care, 
and social and cultural attitudes and norms.
METHODS/DESIGN: This community-based study will be a two-arm randomized 
controlled efficacy trial comparing a multi-level, community program (Strong 
Hearts, Healthy Communities) with a minimal intervention control program (Strong 
Hearts, Healthy Women). Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities was developed by 
integrating content from three evidence-based programs and was informed by 
extensive formative research (e.g. community assessments, focus groups, and key 
informant interviews). Classes will meet twice weekly for one hour for 24 weeks 
and focus on individual-level skill building and behavior change; social and 
civic engagement are also core programmatic elements. Strong Hearts, Healthy 
Women will meet monthly for hour-long sessions over the 24 weeks covering 
similar content in a general, condensed format. Overweight, sedentary women 40 
years of age and older from rural, medically underserved communities (12 in 
Montana and 4 in New York) will be recruited; sites, pair-matched based on 
rurality, will be randomized to full or minimal intervention. Data will be 
collected at baseline, midpoint, intervention completion, and six-month, 
one-year, and eighteen months post-intervention. The primary outcome is change 
in body weight; secondary outcomes include physiologic, anthropometric, 
behavioral, and psychosocial variables. In the full intervention, engagement of 
participants' friends and family members in partnered activities and community 
events is an intervention target, hypothesizing that there will be a reciprocal 
influence of physical activity and diet behavior between participants and their 
social network. Family members and/or friends will be invited to complete 
baseline and follow-up questionnaires about their health behaviors and 
environment, height and weight, and attitudes and beliefs.
DISCUSSION: Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities aims to reduce cardiovascular 
disease morbidity and mortality, improve quality of life, and reduce 
cardiovascular disease-related health care burden in underserved rural 
communities. If successful, the long-term goal is for the program to be 
nationally disseminated, providing a feasible model to reduce cardiovascular 
disease in rural settings.

Mechanical force-induced cytoskeletal reorganization is essential for cell and 
tissue remodeling and homeostasis; however, the underlying cellular mechanisms 
remain elusive. Solo (ARHGEF40) is a RhoA-targeting guanine nucleotide exchange 
factor (GEF) involved in cyclical stretch-induced human endothelial cell 
reorientation and convergent extension cell movement in zebrafish gastrula. In 
this study, we show that Solo binds to keratin-8/keratin-18 (K8/K18) 
intermediate filaments through multiple sites. Solo overexpression promotes the 
formation of thick actin stress fibers and keratin bundles, whereas knockdown of 
Solo, expression of a GEF-inactive mutant of Solo, or inhibition of ROCK 
suppresses stress fiber formation and leads to disorganized keratin networks, 
indicating that the Solo-RhoA-ROCK pathway serves to precisely organize keratin 
networks, as well as to promote stress fibers. Of importance, knockdown of Solo 
or K18 or overexpression of GEF-inactive or deletion mutants of Solo suppresses 
tensile force-induced stress fiber reinforcement. Furthermore, knockdown of Solo 
or K18 suppresses tensile force-induced RhoA activation. These results strongly 
suggest that the interplay between Solo and K8/K18 filaments plays a crucial 
role in tensile force-induced RhoA activation and consequent actin cytoskeletal 
reinforcement.

INTRODUCTION: We examined the placebo effect of caffeine and the combined effect 
of caffeine and caffeine expectancy on maximal voluntary strength.
METHODS: Fourteen men completed 4 randomized, single-blind experimental trials: 
(1) told caffeine, given caffeine (5 mg/kg) (CC); (2) told caffeine, given 
placebo (CP); (3) told placebo, given placebo (PP); and (4) told placebo, given 
caffeine (PC). Maximal voluntary concentric force and fatigue resistance of the 
knee flexors and extensors were measured using isokinetic dynamometry.
RESULTS: A significant and equal improvement in peak concentric force was found 
in the CC and PC trials. Despite participants believing caffeine would evoke a 
performance benefit, there was no effect of CP.
CONCLUSION: Caffeine caused an improvement in some aspects of muscle strength, 
but there was no additional effect of expectancy. Performance was poorer in 
participants who believed caffeine would have the greatest benefit, which 
highlights a link between expected ergogenicity, motivation, and personality 
characteristics. Muscle Nerve 54: 479-486, 2016.

Combined whole-body dual-tracer ((18)F-FDG and (11)C-acetate) PET/CT is 
increasingly used for staging hepatocellular carcinoma, with only limited 
studies investigating the radiation dosimetry data of these scans. The aim of 
the study was to characterize the radiation dosimetry of combined whole-body 
dual-tracer PET/CT protocols.
METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent 
whole-body dual-tracer PET/CT scans were retrospectively reviewed with 
institutional review board approval. OLINDA/EXM 1.1 was used to estimate 
patient-specific internal dose exposure in each organ. Biokinetic models for 
(18)F-FDG and (11)C-acetate as provided by ICRP (International Commission on 
Radiological Protection) publication 106 were used. Standard reference phantoms 
were modified to more closely represent patient-specific organ mass. With 
patient-specific parameters, organ equivalent doses from each CT series were 
estimated using VirtualDose. Dosimetry capabilities for tube current modulation 
protocols were applied by integrating with the latest anatomic realistic models. 
Effective dose was calculated using ICRP publication 103 tissue-weighting 
coefficients for adult male and female, respectively.
RESULTS: Fourteen scans were evaluated (12 men, 2 women; mean age ± SD, 60 ± 
19.48 y). The patient-specific effective dose from (18)F-FDG and (11)C-acetate 
was 6.08 ± 1.49 and 1.56 ± 0.47 mSv, respectively, for male patients and 6.62 ± 
1.38 and 1.79 ± 0.12 mSV, respectively, for female patients. The 
patient-specific effective dose of the CT component, which comprised 2 
noncontrast whole-body scans, to male and female patients was 21.20 ± 8.94 and 
14.79 ± 3.35 mSv, respectively. Thus, the total effective doses of the combined 
whole-body dual-tracer PET/CT studies for male and female patients were 28.84 ± 
10.18 and 23.19 ± 4.61 mSv, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Patient-specific parameters allow for more accurate estimation of 
organ equivalent doses. Considering the substantial radiation dose incurred, 
judicious medical justification is required with every whole-body dual-tracer 
PET/CT referral. Although radiation risks may have less impact for the 
population with cancer because of their reduced life expectancy, the information 
is of interest and relevant for both justification, to evaluate risk/benefit, 
and protocol optimization.

A rare case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a patient with multiple myeloma after 
treatment by lenalidomide.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma-cell malignancy leading to a significant 
life-expectancy shortening. Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) 
approved in the United States for patients with MM. Although the introduction of 
lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone (Len/Dex) has improved the outcome of 
patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), it is a common 
knowledge that lenalidomide has been linked to the development of secondary 
primary malignancies in the MM patients, especially in those who use 
lenalidomide as a maintenance therapy. In the published literature, these are 
also many cases reported by clinicians in different secondary primary 
malignancies after the diagnosis of MM treated with lenalidomide. In this 
present article, we provided our patient who was identified nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (NPC) 46 months after the diagnosis of MM and 21 months after 
lenalidomide treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case 
report related to the occurrence of NPC in a patient with MM after treatment by 
lenalidomide. Although it is not very sure that the incidence of NPC was 
associated with the use of lenalidomide, we clinicians should pay adequate 
attention to this phenomenon in the clinical processing. And much more 
cooperative studies of large numbers of MM patients are needed to evaluate a 
possible association between lenalidomide and NPC.

bortezomib.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most predominant blood malignancy. 
Proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib have increased life expectancy, but 
eventually patients develop resistance to therapy. It was proposed that 
bortezomib acts through the induction of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), 
i.e., accumulation of misfolded proteins causing a lethal stress response. By 
this theory, increasing the proteasome load by the stimulation of translation 
may worsen the UPR. Here we evaluated the crosstalk between translation and 
bortezomib toxicity in both bortezomib sensitive and resistant cells. We found 
that bortezomib toxicity does not correlate with induction of proapoptotic eIF2α 
phosphorylation, but rather caused a late reduction in initiation of 
translation. This effect was accompanied by dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 
target 4E-BP1. Infection of myeloma cells with constitutively dephosphorylated 
4E-BP1, worsened bortezomib induced cell death. Since mTORC1 inhibitors cause 
pharmacological inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, we tested whether they 
could act synergistically with bortezomib. We found that both rapamycin, a 
specific mTORC1 blocker, and PP242 a mTOR antagonist induce the arrest of 
myeloma cells irrespective of bortezomib sensitivity. Sensitivity to mTOR 
inhibitors has been associated to the levels of eIF4E/4E-BPs. We found that 
levels of eIF4E and 4E-BPs are variable among patients, and that 15% of myeloma 
patients have increased levels of 4E-BP1/2. Primary cells of myeloma retain 
sensitivity to mTOR inhibition, when plated on stromal cells. We propose that 
translational load does not contribute to bortezomib-induced death, but rather 
mTOR targeting may be successful in bortezomib resistant patients, stratified 
for eIF4E/4EBPs.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 7-year 
cost-effectiveness of cervical total disc replacement (CTDR) versus anterior 
cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of patients with 
single-level symptomatic degenerative disc disease. A change in the spending 
trajectory for spine care is to be achieved, in part, through the selection of 
interventions that have been proven effective yet cost less than other options. 
This analysis complements and builds upon findings from other cost-effectiveness 
evaluations of CTDR through the use of long-term, patient-level data from a 
randomized study. METHODS This was a 7-year health economic evaluation comparing 
CTDR versus ACDF from the US commercial payer perspective. Prospectively 
collected health care resource utilization and treatment effects 
(quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) were obtained from individual 
patient-level adverse event reports and SF-36 data, respectively, from the 
randomized, multicenter ProDisc-C total disc replacement investigational device 
exemption (IDE) study and post-approval study. Statistical distributions for 
unit costs were derived from a commercial claims database and applied using 
Monte Carlo simulation. Patient-level costs and effects were modeled via 
multivariate probabilistic analysis. Confidence intervals for 7-year costs, 
effects, and net monetary benefit (NMB) were obtained using the nonparametric 
percentile method from results of 10,000 bootstrap simulations. The robustness 
of results was assessed through scenario analysis and within a parametric 
regression model controlling for baseline variables. RESULTS Seven-year 
follow-up data were available for more than 70% of the 209 randomized patients. 
In the base-case analysis, CTDR resulted in mean per-patient cost savings of 
$12,789 (95% CI $5362-$20,856) and per-patient QALY gains of 0.16 (95% CI -0.073 
to 0.39) compared with ACDF over 7 years. CTDR was more effective and less 
costly in 90.8% of probabilistic simulations. CTDR was cost-effective in 99.8% 
of sensitivity analysis simulations and generated a mean incremental NMB of 
$20,679 (95% CI $6053-$35,377) per patient at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS Based on this modeling evaluation, CTDR was found to 
be more effective and less costly over a 7-year time horizon for patients with 
single-level symptomatic degenerative disc disease. These results are robust 
across a range of scenarios and perspectives and are intended to support 
value-based decision making.

Public education mass media campaigns are an important intervention for 
influencing behaviour modifications. However, evidence on the effectiveness of 
such campaigns to encourage the population to reduce sun exposure is limited. 
This study investigates the benefits and costs of three skin cancer campaigns 
implemented in New South Wales from 2006-2013. This analysis uses Australian 
dollars (AUD) and 2010-11 as the currency and base year, respectively. 
Historical data on skin cancer were used to project skin cancer rates for the 
period 2006-2020. The expected number of skin cancer cases is derived by 
combining skin cancer rates, sunburn rates and relative risk of skin cancers due 
to sun exposure. Counterfactual estimates are based on sunburn exposure in the 
absence of the campaigns. Monetary values are attached to direct (treatment) and 
indirect (productivity) costs saved due to fewer skin cancer cases. Monetary 
benefits are compared with the cost of implementing the campaigns and are 
presented in the form of a benefit-cost ratio. Relative to the counterfactual 
(i.e., no campaigns) there are an estimated 13,174 fewer skin cancers and 112 
averted deaths over the period 2006-2013. The net present value of these 
benefits is $60.17 million and the campaign cost is $15.63 million. The benefit 
cost ratio is 3.85, suggesting that for every $1 invested a return of $3.85 is 
achieved. Skin cancer public education mass media campaigns are a good 
investment given the likely extent to which they reduce the morbidity, mortality 
and economic burden of skin cancer.

of Nanjing University Medical School , Jiangsu , China.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a modified home care model in China.
METHODS: First-time stroke survivors were recruited from a comprehensive 
teaching hospital in China. Subjects in the intervention group (n = 168) 
received modified home care involving detailed pre-discharge preparation and 
post-discharge follow-up lasting one month. The following outcomes were assessed 
at the end of follow-up: length of hospital stay, satisfaction with acute 
hospitalisation, medication compliance, complications and stroke-related 
re-hospitalisation. The outcomes were compared for the intervention group and a 
historical control group (n = 173) who received routine care.
RESULTS: Modified home care was associated with shorter acute hospitalisation 
(11.29 ± 2.18 vs. 12.36 ± 4.33 d, p = 0.03), higher compliance [161 (95.83%) vs. 
92 (53.18%), p = 0.004] and ability to perform daily activities (38.25 ± 10.22 
vs. 32.08 ± 10.32, p = 0.03), and a lower rate of re-hospitalisation [2 (1.19%) 
vs. 11 (6.36%), p = 0.02].
CONCLUSIONS: Home care may be associated with higher quality of life and reduced 
dependency among stroke patients in China. Implications for Rehabilitation Home 
care can be effective method at improving the physical and psychological 
well-being of stroke survivors in China. The home care model in this study can 
improve health outcomes as well as reduce healthcare resources utilisation. Home 
care models for stroke survivors should be adapted to local healthcare policies 
and resources.

BACKGROUND: Studies on the immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have 
increasingly gained attention since 1990s. However, there are pros (preventing 
of AD) and cons (incurred cost and side effects) regarding the administration of 
immunotherapy. Up to date, there has been lacking of economic evaluation for 
immunotherapy of AD. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness analysis of the 
vaccination for AD.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized control trials after systemic review was 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine. A Markov decision model was 
constructed and applied to a 120,000-Taiwanese cohort aged ≥65 years. Person 
years and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were computed between the 
vaccinated group and the the unvaccinated group. Economic evaluation was 
performed to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC).
RESULTS: Vaccinated group gained an additional 0.84 life years and 0.56 QALYs 
over 10-years and an additional 0.35 life years and 0.282 QALYs over 5-years of 
follow-up. The vaccinated group dominated the unvaccinated group by ICER over 
5-years of follow-up. The ICERs of 10-year follow-up for the vaccinated group 
against the unvaccinated group were $13,850 per QALY and $9,038 per life year 
gained. Given the threshold of $20,000 of willingness to pay (WTP), the CEAC 
showed the probability of being cost-effective for vaccination with QALY was 
70.7% and 92% for life years gained after 10-years of follow-up. The 
corresponding figures were 87.3% for QALY and 93.5% for life years gained over 
5-years follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The vaccination for AD was cost-effective in gaining QALY and life 
years compared with no vaccination, under the condition of a reasonable 
threshold of WTP.

Spinal cord injury caused by stab wounds (SCISW) results from a partial or 
complete transection of the cord, and presents opportunities for interventional 
research. It is recognized that there is low incidence, but little is known 
about the natural history or the patient's suitability for long-term clinical 
outcome studies. This study aims to provide population-based evidence of the 
demographics of SCISW, and highlight the issues regarding the potential for 
future research. The database of the Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries 
Unit (QENSIU), the sole center for treating SCI in Scotland, was reviewed 
between 1994 and 2013 to ascertain the incidence, demographics, functional 
recovery, and mortality rates for new SCISW. During this 20 year period, 35 
patients with SCISW were admitted (97.1% male, mean age 30.0 years); 31.4% had a 
cervical injury, 60.0% had a thoracic injury, and 8.6% had a lumbar injury. All 
had a neurological examination, with 42.9% diagnosed as motor complete on 
admission and 77.1% discharged as motor incomplete. A total of 70.4% of patients 
with an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) level of A to 
C on admission had an improved AIS level on discharge. Nine (25.7%) patients 
have died since discharge, with mean life expectancy for these patients being 
9.1 years after injury (20-65 years of age). Patients had higher levels of 
comorbidities, substance abuse, secondary events, and poor compliance compared 
with the general SCI population, which may have contributed to the high 
mortality rate observed post-discharge. The low incidence, heterogeneous nature, 
spontaneous recovery rate, and problematic follow-up makes those with 
penetrating stab injuries of the spinal cord a challenging patient group for SCI 
research.

AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of integrating nalmefene within the 
treatment pathway for alcohol dependence recommended by the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence in the UK.
METHODS: A Markov model, taking a UK NHS perspective, followed a cohort with 
alcohol dependence and high/very high drinking risk levels (HVHDRLs), who do not 
require immediate detoxification and who continue at HVHDRLs after initial 
assessment, for 5 years. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from 
treatment with nalmefene plus psychosocial support versus psychosocial support 
alone were modelled. The consequent incidence of alcohol-attributable harmful 
events and disease progression, with the possibility of requiring other options 
or recurrent treatment, were captured.
RESULTS: Nalmefene plus psychosocial support dominated psychosocial support 
alone, with lower costs and increased QALYs after 5 years. Savings are driven by 
the higher response to nalmefene, and the subsequent lower cost accumulation for 
alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: Nalmefene represents a highly cost-effective treatment option in 
this population. The analysis shows that integrating nalmefene within the 
current UK clinical treatment pathway for alcohol dependence could reduce the 
economic burden on the NHS by limiting harmful events and disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Preventing dementia has been proposed to increase population health 
as well as reduce the demand for health and social care. Our aim was to evaluate 
whether preventing dementia by promoting physical activity (PA) a) improves 
population health or b) reduces expenditure for both health and social care if 
one takes into account the additional demand in health and social care caused by 
increased life expectancy.
METHODS: A simulation model was developed that models the relation between PA, 
dementia, mortality, and the use of health care and social care in England. With 
this model, scenarios were evaluated in which different assumptions were made 
about the increase in PA level in (part of) the population.
RESULTS: Lifetime spending on health and social care related to dementia was 
highest for the physically inactive (£28,100/£28,900 for 40-year-old 
males/females), but spending on other diseases was highest for those that meet 
PA recommendations (£55,200/£43,300 for 40-year-old males/females) due to their 
longer life expectancies. If the English population aged 40-65 were to increase 
their PA by one level, life expectancy would increase by 0.23years and health 
and social care expenditures would decrease by £400 per person.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventing dementia by increasing PA increases life expectancy and 
can result in decreased spending overall on health and social care, even after 
additional spending during life years gained has been taken into account. If 
prevention is targeted at the physically inactive, savings in dementia-related 
costs outweigh the additional spending in life years gained.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors and 
establish a model for predicting life expectancy in International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IVB cervical cancer patients.
METHODS: The baseline characteristics and outcome data of patients with stage 
IVB cervical cancer between May 1994 and October 2014 were collected and 
retrospectively reviewed. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used 
to identify independent predictors of survival in stage IVB cervical cancer 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included in our database. The median 
overall survival (OS) period was 16 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that 
the metastatic site (hazards ratio, 3.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-4.88; P 
< 0.0001) and a white blood cell (WBC) count exceeding 10,000/μL (hazards ratio, 
2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.30; P = 0.0102) were significant 
prognostic factors in terms of OS. Patient survival was inversely correlated 
with the number of these prognostic factors possessed. When the patients were 
divided into 3 prognostic groups, the median OS of the patients with 0, 1, or 2 
poor prognostic factors was 26, 12, and 7 months, respectively. Among the 
patients with WBC counts of less than 10,000/μL, treatment with radiotherapy 
resulted in improved survival compared with chemotherapy or palliative care 
alone. In contrast, radiotherapy had minimal effects on survival in patients 
with WBC counts of greater than 10,000/μL.
CONCLUSIONS: The metastatic site and an elevated WBC count are significant 
prognostic factors in patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. Our prognostic 
model composed of these 2 clinical variables might enable physicians to predict 
survival more accurately.

The Case for Adolescent HIV Vaccination in South Africa: A Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis.

of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (NM, GG); South African HVTN AIDS Vaccine 
Early Stage Investigator Program (SHAPe) (NM); The South African Department of

Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), University of 
Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa (NM); and Health Systems Governance and 
Finance, World Health Organization, Geneva (MB).

Despite comprising 0.7% of the world population, South Africa is home to 18% of 
the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. Unyielding HIV 
subepidemics among adolescents threaten national attempts to curtail the disease 
burden. Should an HIV vaccine become available, establishing its point of entry 
into the health system becomes a priority. This study assesses the impact of 
school-based HIV vaccination and explores how variations in vaccine 
characteristics affect cost-effectiveness. The cost per quality adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained associated with school-based adolescent HIV vaccination 
services was assessed using Markov modeling that simulated annual cycles based 
on national costing data. The estimation was based on a life expectancy of 70 
years and employs the health care provider perspective. The simultaneous 
implementation of HIV vaccination services with current HIV management programs 
would be cost-effective, even at relatively higher vaccine cost. At base vaccine 
cost of US$ 12, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$ 43 per 
QALY gained, with improved ICER values yielded at lower vaccine costs. The ICER 
was sensitive to duration of vaccine mediated protection and variations in 
vaccine efficacy. Data from this work demonstrate that vaccines offering longer 
duration of protection and at lower cost would result in improved ICER values. 
School-based HIV vaccine services of adolescents, in addition to current HIV 
prevention and treatment health services delivered, would be cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: The management of patients with recurrent neck cancer invading the 
carotid artery is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
overall survival rate, primary patency of vascular reconstructions, and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) after en bloc resection of the carotid 
artery and tumor with in-line polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) carotid grafting, 
followed by radiotherapy.
METHODS: From 2000 to 2014, 31 consecutive patients with recurrent neck cancer 
invading the carotid artery underwent en bloc resection and simultaneous carotid 
artery reconstruction with a PTFE graft, which was associated in 18 cases with a 
myocutaneous flap. The primary tumor was a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx 
in 17 patients and of the hypopharynx in 7, an undifferentiated carcinoma of 
unknown origin in 4, and an anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid in 3. All of the 
patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy (50-70 Gy), and 10 of them also 
underwent chemotherapy (doxorubicin and cisplatin).
RESULTS: None of the patients died or sustained a stroke during the first 
30 days after the index procedure. Postoperative morbidity consisted of 6 
transitory dysphagias, 3 vocal cord palsies, 2 wound dehiscences, 1 transitory 
mandibular claudication, and 1 partial myocutaneous flap necrosis. No graft 
infection occurred during follow-up. Fifteen patients (48%) died from metastatic 
cancer during a mean follow-up of 45.4 months (range, 8-175 months). None of the 
patients showed evidence of local recurrence, stroke, or thrombosis of the 
carotid reconstruction. The 5-year survival rate was 49 ± 10%. The overall 
number of QALYs was 3.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.87-4.37) with a significant 
difference between patients without metastasis at the time of redo surgery (n = 
26; QALYs, 3.74) and those with metastasis (n = 5; QALYs, 0.56; P = .005). QALYs 
were also significantly improved in patients with cancer of the larynx (n = 17; 
QALYs, 4.69) compared to patients presenting with other types of tumors (n = 14; 
QALYs, 1.29; P = .032).
CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive en bloc resection of recurrent neck cancer with PTFE 
grafting can be curative in patients without metastases at the time of redo 
surgery. In this subset of patients, extensive neck surgery with carotid artery 
replacement can lead to excellent local control of the disease with improved 
quality of survival.

Detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) is a debilitating problem in 
patients with spinal cord injury. DSD carries a high risk of complications, and 
even life expectancy can be affected. Management of this condition includes the 
use of antimuscarinic agents in combination with intermittent catheterization, 
indwelling urethral catheterization, suprapubic catheterization, and a variety 
of surgical options, depending on patient and physician preference. This paper 
will review the current literature and data on minimally invasive and endoscopic 
management of DSD.
