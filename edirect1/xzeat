HRQoL of RRMM patients.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of Medline/PubMed, Wiley 
Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and Clinicaltrials.gov to identify 
clinical studies in RRMM patients with HRQoL as an outcome measure. The ISOQoL 
and CONSORT-PRO extension guidelines were used to assess the quality of HRQoL 
reporting. We synthesized the result using a qualitative analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 10,245 RRMM patients enrolled in 28 eligible studies 
received either a triplet, doublet regimen, monotherapy, or salvage autologous 
stem cell transplantation. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was the most used questionnaire, 
and compliance with HRQoL reporting standards is generally poor among studies 
without an additional HRQoL publication. Most of the current therapeutic options 
are at best able to maintain HRQoL at baseline but not improve it. The 
methodological and reporting heterogeneity among the studies complicates 
generalizations.
CONCLUSIONS: Many of the current treatment regimens for RRMM have demonstrated 
clinical effectiveness in trials. Unlike newly diagnosed MM, these regimens are 
less likely to result in significant improvement in HRQoL in RRMM. This should 
be communicated to patients before initiating therapies.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Individualized therapeutic approach for RRMM 
should be chosen based on a shared decision-making process that aligns clinical 
efficacy with patients' treatment priorities and HRQoL.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HA) are common diseases in the 
population of people over 65 years of age. Many studies show the impact of the 
long-lasting decompensation of these chronic diseases, often diagnosed in middle 
age, on the cognitive functioning of elderly patients.
RESULTS: There is almost 30% prevalence of cognitive impairment among patients 
diagnosed with arterial hypertension. Possible explanation includes 
intensification of inflammatory processes in the central nervous system, 
influence on cerebral blood flow and acceleration of atherosclerosis. Another 
analyzed factor is the presence of diabetes. DM impacts the development of 
Alzheimer's disease. The inflammatory processes are intensified by advanced 
glycation products promoting atherosclerotic changes in blood vessels. In 
addition to that, the presence of hypoglycemic episodes significantly increases 
the risk of dementia. Moreover, approximately 78% of adult diabetic patients are 
also diagnosed with arterial hypertension, resulting in the coexistence of these 
CNS damaging mechanisms. The effect of elevated total cholesterol concentration 
on cognitive performance is still under debate and more research is needed. The 
role of the presence of ApoE4 in the development of cognitive dysfunctions, 
including Alzheimer's disease is emphasized.
CONCLUSIONS: In daily medical practice, extraordinary attention should be paid 
to control of chronic diseases of the patient, especially in the middle age. It 
improves cognitive functioning, possibly extending the quality-adjusted life 
year expectancy.

Stillbirth (SB) is a threshold character that has been detected as the most 
important factor affecting the future reproductive life of an animal. In 
buffaloes, stillbirth accounts for approximately 42% of all reproductive 
disorders being considered as the main reproductive disorder in buffalo calves. 
The present study aimed to estimate the heritability values and to determine the 
genetic and phenotypic correlation between stillbirth rate and birth weight (BW) 
using a Bayesian approach via Gibbs sampling method in a river buffalo 
population. A stochastic simulation was used to create a population in which 
random mating was used for 15 discrete generations. A bivariate animal model 
including maternal effects was used. Maternal effects were significant (p < .05) 
for both BW and SB. The results showed that when the SB rate increased from 1% 
to 50%, the estimated direct heritability of SB increased. Yet, by increasing 
the SB rate from 50% to 99%, a decrease of the SB estimated direct heritability 
was observed. The genetic correlation between BW and SB was decreased by 
increasing the level of occurrence of SB in the population from 1% to 99%. The 
root mean square error (RMSE) of heritability was increased from 40% to 70% 
level of occurrence of SB. Based on findings, it can be concluded that to reduce 
stillbirth rate in the population, it is possible to use genetic improvement 
program and birth weight could be one of the main components of a selection 
goal.

PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the effect of deep tissue massage (DTM) on 
the myofascial trigger point (MTrP) number, neck range of motion (ROM), pain, 
disability and quality of life in patients with Myofacial pain syndrome (MPS).
METHODS: The study involved patients with MPS between the ages of 20-57. The 
patients were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 40) and 
the study group (n = 40). Transcutaneous Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulation 
(TENS), hotpack and ultrasound were applied to 40 patients in the control group. 
The study group was also administered DTM for 12 sessions in addition to TENS, 
hotpack and ultrasound applications. Neck pain and disability scale (NPDS) for a 
neck disability, universal goniometer for neck ROM, MTrP count using manual 
palpation, Short Form 36 (SF-36) for quality of life and severity of neck pain 
were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). All patients were evaluated 
before and after treatment.
RESULTS: It was found that the DTM group has statistically more improvement than 
the control group for VAS, NPDS and SF-36. Moreover, although there was a 
significant improvement in favour of the study group for extension, lateral 
flexion, right rotation and left rotation in the neck ROM, there was no 
significant difference in flexion measurements between the study and control 
group.
CONCLUSION: In addition to the traditional rehabilitation program, DTM is 
effective on neck ROM, pain, disability and quality of life. Therefore, DTM 
treatment is a safe and inexpensive treatment method that can be applied in 
patients with MPS.

BACKGROUND: Thousands of people worldwide pass away yearly due to neurological 
disorders, cardiovascular illnesses, cancer, metabolic disorders, and microbial 
infections. Additionally, a sizable population has also been impacted by 
hepatotoxicity, ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and breast fissure. 
These ailments are likewise steadily increasing along with the increase in life 
expectancy. Finding innovative therapies to cure and consequently lessen the 
impact of these ailments is, therefore, a global concern.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: All provided literature on Guaiazulene (GA) and its 
related compounds were searched using various electronic databases such as 
PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Elsevier, Springer, ACS, CNKI, and books 
via the keywords Guaiazulene, Matricaria chamomilla, GA-related compounds, and 
Guaiazulene analogous.
RESULTS: The FDA has approved the bicyclic sesquiterpene GA, commonly referred 
to as azulon or 1,4-dimethyl-7-isopropylazulene, as a component in cosmetic 
colorants. The pleiotropic health advantages of GA and related substances, 
especially their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, attracted a lot of 
research. Numerous studies have found that GA can help to manage various 
conditions, including bacterial infections, tumors, immunomodulation, 
expectorants, diuretics, diaphoresis, ulcers, dermatitis, proliferation, and 
gastritis. These conditions all involve lipid peroxidation and inflammatory 
response. In this review, we have covered the biomedical applications of GA. 
Moreover, we also emphasize the therapeutic potential of guaiazulene derivatives 
in pre-clinical and clinical settings, along with their underlying mechanism(s).
CONCLUSION: GA and its related compounds exhibit therapeutic potential in 
several diseases. Still, it is necessary to investigate their potential in 
animal models for various other ailments and establish their safety profile. 
They might be a good candidate to advance to clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Many migraine patients do not respond adequately to conventional 
preventive treatments and are therefore described as treatment/medically 
resistant or difficult to treat cases. Calcitonin gene-related peptide 
monoclonal antibodies are a relatively novel molecular treatment for episodic 
and chronic migraine that have been shown to be effective in short duration 
clinical trials in approximately 40-50% of all chronic migraine patients. 
Patient Related Outcome Measures (PROM) or Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires 
are used to help measure response to treatment in migraine. Although some open 
label extension studies have become available for erenumab, there is a lack of 
real-world data pertaining to quality of life in the medium to long-term for 
chronic and treatment resistant migraine patients.
METHODS: A total of 177 treatment resistant CM patients were started on erenumab 
(70 mg or 140 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks) in our three specialist 
Headache Clinics. Of these, 174 had their first injection between December 2018 
and October 2019. All patients were evaluated with the following PROM: the 
Headache Impact Test- 6, Migraine Associated Disability Assessment test and 
Migraine-Specific QoL Questionnaire, before starting treatment with erenumab and 
at intervals of 3-12 months after starting treatment. The decision to continue 
treatment was based on subjective clinical improvement of at least 30% (as 
reported by the patient), supported with diaries and QoL questionnaires. We 
present here the QoL measurements for this group of 177 patients. Prior 
preventive migraine treatments included conventional oral prophylactic 
medications (such as topiramate, candesartan, propranolol, or amitriptyline), at 
least two cycles of PREEMPT protocol onabotulinumtoxin A or (in a small number 
of cases) neuromodulation with single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
RESULTS: Of the 177 patients who started treatment with erenumab, 68/177 (38.4%) 
stopped during the first year, either due to lack of efficacy (no significant 
benefit or only minimal improvement) and/or possible side effects. 109/177 
(61.6%) patients reported clinically significant improvement after 6-12 months 
and wished to stay on treatment. Twelve of these 109 patients subsequently 
stopped treatment in the period between 1 year and up to June 2021 (mainly due 
to a worsening of their migraine). Therefore, a total of 97/177 patients (54.8%) 
remained on treatment as of June 2021 (duration of treatment 17-30 months, 
median of 25 months).
CONCLUSION: Approximately 55% of treatment resistant or difficult to treat CM 
patients who trialled erenumab in our clinics reported a subjective benefit and 
were still on treatment after 17-30 months.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer have been reported to be more likely 
to receive goal-concordant care if they have accurate prognostic awareness. 
However, many patients do not have this awareness. This study aimed to examine 
the prognostic awareness among Japanese patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: This single-center, follow-up cohort study included Japanese patients 
with advanced cancer who received chemotherapy at Tohoku University Hospital 
between January 2015 and January 2016. Patients were surveyed at enrollment and 
followed up for clinical events for 5 years thereafter. We compared (i) the 
patients' prognostic awareness with both actual survival time and physician's 
prediction of survival and (ii) physician's prediction of survival time with 
actual survival. Factors associated with accurate prognostic awareness were 
identified by univariate analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 133 patients eligible for the study, 57 patients were analyzed. 
Only 10 (17.5%) patients had accurate prognostic awareness. Forty-three patients 
(75.4%) were optimistic about their prognosis; >80% of patients were more 
optimistic than their physicians about their prognosis. The physicians' 
predictions were accurate in for patients (37.5%). Accurate prognostic awareness 
was associated with physician's explanation of the prognosis and patients' 
perception of a good death.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the patients with advanced cancer in this study had 
prognostic awareness that was more optimistic in comparison with their actual 
survival, and most were more optimistic than their physicians about their 
prognosis. Further research is needed to develop programs to facilitate the 
discussion of life expectancy with patients in a manner that is consistent with 
their preferences.

Early detection of lung cancer biomarkers in exhaled breath by modified armchair 
stanene nanoribbons.

Author information:

In this study, we analyze armchair stanene nanoribbons as excellent sensing 
substances for the early diagnosis of lung cancer using density functional 
theory and the non-equilibrium Green function. Four modified configurations of 
surface- and edge-defected armchair stanene nanoribbons were studied to improve 
the sensing performance. Our probes indicated that the adsorption energy of 
armchair stanene nanoribbons is at least five times greater than that of other 
previously reported substances, such as single-wall carbon nanotubes, 
phosphorene, and silicene. A noticeable reduction in the current was observed, 
implying the high sensitivity of our sensing configurations. The adsorption 
energy and current results suggest that configurations with a single vacancy and 
edge defects improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the system because of 
their free dangling bonds. The calculated results demonstrate that the both-side 
edge defected armchair stanene nanoribbons reduce the adsorption energy to -8.35 
eV and increase the sensitivity up to 45% for toluene detection. This reduction 
in adsorption energy and the surge of sensitivity shows ultra-high sensing 
performance, yielding a more efficient structure for the future design of 
early-diagnosis lung cancer sensing applications, thus improving lung cancer 
patients' survival and life expectancy.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis. The prevalence and the 
incidence of OA have been continuously growing along with increased life 
expectancy and the emerging problem of an aging population around the global. 
Reported findings have confirmed that osteoarthritis is a chronic inflammatory 
disease and its major risk factors included genetic susceptibility, aging, and 
environmental factors. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of osteoarthritis 
remain unclear. Recent studies have shown that oral-gut microbes are associated 
with the onset and development of osteoarthritis and may provide new targets for 
osteoarthritis treatment. Herein, we reviewed the latest developments in 
research on the relationship between oral-gut microbes and the onset and 
development of osteoarthritis, with a view to creating new perspectives for 
further elucidation of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and exploration of 
effective treatments in the future.

BACKGROUND: Adherence to preventative inhaled therapies in people with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) is low, resulting in potentially avoidable health losses and the 
need for costly rescue therapies.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the CFHealthHub (CFHH) 
intervention to support adherence to inhaled medications.
METHODS: A state transition model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of the CFHH intervention versus usual care from the perspective of the UK 
National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. 
Costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3.5 percent per annum. 
Costs were valued at 2021/22 prices. The model structure includes health states 
defined by survival status, level of lung function, and transplant history. 
Treatment effects were modeled by changing the probabilities of transitioning 
between lung function states and reducing exacerbation rates. Model parameters 
were informed by the CFHH trial, CF Registry data, routine cost databases, 
literature, and expert opinion. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: The CFHH intervention is expected to generate additional health gains 
and cost savings compared with usual care. Assuming that it is delivered for 
10 years, the CFHH intervention is expected to generate 0.17 additional 
quality-adjusted life years and cost savings of GBP 1,600 (EUR 1,662) per 
patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The CFHH intervention is expected to dominate usual care, 
irrespective of the duration over which the intervention is delivered. The 
modeled benefits and cost savings are smaller than initially expected and are 
sensitive to relative treatment effects on lung function.

Now is the time to fix the evidence generation system.

Despite enormous advances in biomedical science, corresponding improvements in 
health outcomes lag significantly. This is particularly true in the United 
States, where life expectancy trails far behind that of other high-income 
countries. In addition, substantial disparities in life expectancy and other 
health outcomes exist as a function of race, ethnicity, wealth, education, and 
geographic location. A major reformation of our national system for generating 
medical evidence-the clinical research enterprise-is needed to facilitate the 
translation of biomedical research into useful products and interventions. 
Currently, premarket systems for generating and evaluating evidence work 
reasonably well, but the postmarket phase is disaggregated and often fails to 
answer essential questions that must be addressed to provide optimal clinical 
care and public health interventions for all Americans. Solving these problems 
will require a focus on three key domains: (1) improving the integration of and 
access to high-quality data from traditional clinical trials, electronic health 
records, and personal devices and wearable sensors; (2) restructuring clinical 
research operations to support and incentivize the involvement of patients and 
frontline clinicians; and (3) articulating ethical constructs that enable 
responsible data sharing to support improved implementation. Finally, we must 
also address the systemic tendency to optimize individual components of the 
clinical research enterprise without considering the effects on the system as a 
whole. Overcoming suboptimization by creating incentives for integration and 
sharing will be essential to achieve more timely and equitable improvement in 
health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: The proximal humerus is a frequent site for both primary and 
secondary bone tumors. Several options are currently available to reconstruct 
the resected humerus, but there is no consensus regarding optimal 
reconstruction. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the 
functional outcome, complications and patient compliance following four 
different types of reconstructive techniques.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors performed 90 proximal humerus resections due 
to primary and secondary bone tumors over the past 21 years. Four different 
procedures were performed for reconstruction following the resection: fibula 
autograft transplantation, osteoarticular allograft implantation, modular tumor 
endoprosthesis (hemiarthroplasty) and reconstruction of the defect with a 
reverse shoulder prosthesis-allograft composite. A retrospective analysis of the 
complications and patient's physical status was performed. Functional outcome 
and life quality was evaluated by using the MSTS and SF-36 scores.
RESULTS: The best range of motion was observed following arthroplasty with a 
reverse shoulder prosthesis-homograft composite followed by a fibula autograft 
reconstruction. Revision surgery was required due to major complications most 
frequently in the osteoarticular allograft group, followed by the reverse 
shoulder prosthesis-allograft composite group, the autologous fibula 
transplantation group; the tumor endoprosthesis hemiarthroplasty group had 
superior results regarding revision surgery (40, 25, 24 and 14% respectively). 
MSTS was 84% on average for the reverse shoulder prosthesis-allograft composite 
group, 70% for the autologous fibula group, 67% for the anatomical 
hemiarthroplasty group and 64% for the osteoartricular allograft group. Using 
the SF-36 questionnaire for assessment no significant differences were found 
between the four groups regarding quality of life.
DISCUSSION: Based on the results of our study the best functional performance 
(range of motion and patient compliance) was achieved in the a reverse 
prosthesis-allograft combination group-in cases where the axillary nerve could 
be spared. The use of an osteoarticular allograft resulted in unsatisfying 
functional results and high complication rates, therefore we do not recommend it 
as a reconstructive method following resection of the proximal humerus due to 
either primary or metastatic bone tumors. Young patients who have good life 
expectancy but a small humerus or intramedullar cavity reconstruction by 
implantation of a fibula autograft is a good option. For patients with a poor 
prognosis (i.g. bone metastases) or in cases where the axillary nerve must be 
sacrificed, hemiarthroplasty using a tumor endoprosthesis was found to have 
acceptable results with a low complication rate. According to the MSTS and SF-36 
functional scoring systems patients compliance was nearly identical following 
all four types of reconstruction techniques; the underlying cause may be the 
complexity of the shoulder girdle. However, we recommend the implantation of a 
reverse shoulder prosthesis-allograft whenever indication is appropriate, as it 
has been demonstrated to provide excellent functional outcomes, especially in 
young adults.

INTRODUCTION: The randomized phase III KEYNOTE-522 trial demonstrated that 
addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy provided a significant 
improvement in event-free survival and a favorable trend in overall survival for 
high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (eTNBC). This analysis 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and continued as a single-agent adjuvant 
treatment after surgery vs. neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk 
eTNBC in the USA.
METHODS: The analysis was conducted from a US third-party public healthcare 
payer perspective. A multistate transition model was developed using efficacy 
and safety data from the KEYNOTE-522 trial. The model included four mutually 
exclusive health states: event-free, locoregional recurrence, distant 
metastasis, and death to simulate patients' lifetime disease course. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated on the basis of EuroQoL-5 
Dimensions utility data collected in KEYNOTE-522. Costs for drug 
acquisition/administration, adverse events, disease management, and subsequent 
therapies were reported (2021 US dollars). Costs and outcomes were discounted at 
3% annually. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the main results.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by 
pembrolizumab resulted in expected gains of 3.37 life years (LYs) and 
2.90 QALYs, and an incremental cost of $79,046 versus chemotherapy. The 
incremental cost per QALY gained was $27,285, which is lower than all commonly 
cited US willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses showed the results 
were robust over plausible values of key model inputs and assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pembrolizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and continued as a 
single-agent adjuvant treatment after surgery is considered a cost-effective 
option for high-risk eTNBC in the USA.

Rural communities are at higher risk for physical inactivity, poor dietary 
behaviors, and related chronic diseases and obesity. These disparities are 
largely driven by built environment, socioeconomic, and social factors. A 
community-based cluster randomized controlled trial of an intervention, the 
Change Club, aims to address some of these disparities via civic engagement for 
built environment change. Baseline data collection began in February 2020, only 
to be paused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, the investigators 
evaluated multiple approaches for collecting data when the study resumed, 
focusing on Life’s Simple 7, and additional anthropometric, physiologic, and 
behavioral outcomes in rural and micropolitan (<50,000 population) communities 
in Texas and New York. Life’s Simple 7 includes fasting blood glucose, total 
cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, physical activity, diet, and smoking. Rigor 
and feasibility were considered across a variety of in-person versus at-home 
measurement options. After a comprehensive input from participants, partners, 
staff, researchers, and the funding liaison, the study team chose 
self-measurement and use of validated questionnaires/surveys to measure the 
Life’s Simple 7 components. This case provides an example of how a study team 
might adjust data collection protocol during unexpected and acute events while 
giving consideration to rigor, feasibility, stakeholder views, and participants’ 
health and safety.

An increasing number of elders in a general population and longer life 
expectancy have a negative outcome in the growth of dissemination of 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The NDs like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) show 
sex-dependent prevalence. It is considered that sex steroids could influence on 
the NDs occurrence. Epidemiological studies indicate that women suffer more 
frequently from AD, whereas men from PD and ALS. Research suggest 
neuroprotective effects of estrogens and confirm that factors reducing their 
level may have a contribution to a higher morbidity rate to NDs. Adverse effects 
of androgens on NDs have been noticed, however some data suggest their 
beneficial actions. Therefore, the understanding of the potential role of sex 
steroids and their receptors in the pathogenesis and course of NDs would 
contribute to broadening the knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to NDs. 
Moreover effective prevention and treatment could be assessed in the future.

Publisher: Wraz ze wzrostem średniej długości życia i starzeniem się ludzkiej 
populacji, zwiększa się odsetek osób cierpiących na choroby neurodegeneracyjne 
(NDs). W przypadku choroby Alzheimera (AD), choroby Parkinsona (PD) i 
stwardnienia zanikowego bocznego (ALS), zaobserwowano wyraźną dysproporcję w 
zachorowalności w zależności od płci. Uważa się, że może to mieć związek z 
wpływem steroidów płciowych na ryzyko wystąpienia tych chorób. Dane 
epidemiologiczne pokazują, że na AD częściej cierpią kobiety, natomiast PD i ALS 
są bardziej rozpowszechnione u mężczyzn. Liczne badania wskazują na 
neuroprotekcyjne działanie estrogenów i potwierdzają, że czynniki redukujące ich 
poziom zwiększają ryzyko zachorowania na NDs. Odwrotne efekty zaobserwowano dla 
androgenów, chociaż dowiedziono także korzystnego wpływu tych hormonów. 
Zrozumienie potencjalnej roli steroidów płciowych i ich receptorów w patogenezie 
i przebiegu NDs może przyczynić się do lepszego poznania molekularnych 
mechanizmów leżących u podłoża tych schorzeń, a tym samym do opracowania 
skuteczniejszych sposobów prewencji i leczenia.

BACKGROUND: The role of bacterial translocation in Crohn's disease has been 
extensively studied. However, data regarding bacterial translocation into the 
mesentery in patients with ulcerative colitis were scarce.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the relationship between bacterial 
translocation and postoperative outcome by comparing the microbiome profile of 
different anatomical sites in patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent 
proctocolectomy and IPAA.
DESIGN: A prospective study.
SETTING: This study was conducted at the Jinling Hospital from August 2017 to 
May 2018.
PATIENTS: Samples of 27 patients with ulcerative colitis who had IPAA and 15 
healthy controls who underwent routine colonoscopy were collected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiome profile of different tissue sites and 
short- and long-term outcomes after IPAA in patients with ulcerative colitis.
RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in mesenteric lymph nodes of 51.9% of 
patients with ulcerative colitis (14/27) and in mesenteric adipose tissue of 
66.7% of patients (18/27). The microbiome in mesenteric lymph nodes and 
mesenteric adipose tissue resembled the mucosal microbiome to a greater extent 
than the fecal microbiome. Positive bacterial DNA in mesenteric lymph nodes 
(8/14 vs 0/13; p = 0.002) was associated with pouchitis within 12 months after 
IPAA, whereas Bray-Curtis distance in mesenteric lymph nodes was significantly 
different between patients with pouchitis and without ( p = 0.009).
LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its small sample size and lacked situ 
experiment to confirm the true bacterial translation.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation was highly prevalent in patients with 
ulcerative colitis. The translocated bacteria DNA in mesenteric adipose tissue 
and mesenteric lymph nodes was highly correlated and more likely to originate 
from mucosal than fecal microbiome. Also, the extent of bacterial translocation 
and translocation of certain bacteria might be associated with the early 
development of pouchitis after IPAA. This might represent an unprecedented 
technique to predict pouchitis using mesenteric lymph node bacterial profiles.

en los ganglios linfáticos mesentéricos de pacientes con 
reservoritis.LIMITACIÓN:Este estudio estuvo limitado por el pequeño tamaño de la 
muestra y la falta de un experimento in situ para confirmar la verdadera

prevalente en pacientes con colitis ulcerosa. El ADN bacteriano translocado en 
el tejido adiposo mesentérico y los ganglios linfáticos mesentéricos estaba 
altamente correlacionado y era más probable que se originara en el microbioma de 
la mucosa que en el fecal. Además, la extensión de la translocación bacteriana y 
la translocación de ciertas bacterias podría estar asociada con el desarrollo 
temprano de reservoritis después de la anastomosis del reservorio ileoanal. Esto 
podría representar una técnica sin precedentes para predecir la reservoritis 
utilizando perfiles bacterianos de los ganglios linfáticos mesentéricos.

Mortality inequalities in France since the 1920s: Evidence of a reversal of the 
income gradient in mortality.

Many recent studies show that Europe has had a lower mortality inequality for 
most ages than the United States over the last thirty years. However, the 
evolution of the income gradient in mortality all along the twentieth century 
remains poorly understood. This article uses a unique dataset that gives the 
annual lifetables and fiscal income for the 90 administrative regions of 
mainland France from 1922 to 2020. The income gradients in mortality are 
computed across regions using a traditional method with calendar ages and, 
alternatively, with mortality milestones to control for the increase in life 
expectancy over time. The study reveals a systematic reversal of the gradient 
that occurred around the 1970s for both sexes and all ages or mortality groups 
when calculated at an aggregated level. Inequality in mortality amongst the 
oldest age groups has however returned to a level observed at least ten years 
earlier because of Covid-19, even after controlling for mortality improvements 
over the period.

Active touch facilitates environments exploration by voluntary, self-generated 
movements. However, the neural mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control for 
active touch are poorly understood. During foraging and feeding, Drosophila 
gather information on the properties of food (texture, hardness, taste) by 
constant probing with their proboscis. Here we identify a group of neurons (sd-L 
neurons) on the fly labellum that are mechanosensitive to labellum displacement 
and synapse onto the sugar-sensing neurons via axo-axonal synapses to induce 
preference to harder food. These neurons also feed onto the motor circuits that 
control proboscis extension and labellum spreading to provide on-line sensory 
feedback critical for controlling the probing processes, thus facilitating 
ingestion of less liquified food. Intriguingly, this preference was eliminated 
in mated female flies, reflecting an elevated need for softer food. Our results 
propose a sensorimotor circuit composed of mechanosensory, gustatory and motor 
neurons that enables the flies to select ripe yet not over-rotten food by active 
touch.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of California's statewide 
perinatal quality collaborative for reducing severe maternal morbidity (SMM) 
from hemorrhage.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model using open source software (Amua 0.30) 
compared outcomes and costs within a simulated cohort of 480,000 births to 
assess the annual effect in the state of California. Our model captures both the 
short-term costs and outcomes that surround labor and delivery and long-term 
effects over a person's remaining lifetime. Previous studies that evaluated the 
effectiveness of the CMQCC's (California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative) 
statewide perinatal quality collaborative initiative-reduction of 
hemorrhage-related SMM by increasing recognition, measurement, and timely 
response to postpartum hemorrhage-provided estimates of intervention 
effectiveness. Primary cost data received from select hospitals within the study 
allowed for the estimation of collaborative costs, with all other model inputs 
derived from literature. Costs were inflated to 2021 dollars with a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gained. Various sensitivity analyses were performed including one-way, 
scenario-based, and probabilistic sensitivity (Monte Carlo) analysis.
RESULTS: The collaborative was cost effective, exhibiting strong dominance when
