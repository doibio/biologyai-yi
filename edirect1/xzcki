PURPOSE: The main objective of this study was to compare quality of life and 
functional outcome in patients who have undergone a single-radius (SR) or 
multi-radius (MR) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The secondary objective was to 
observe changes in knee range of movement (ROM) and standardized knee scores 
(KSCs) in these patients. The hypothesis was that there would be no 
statistically significant difference between the two patient groups in quality 
of life and functional outcome.
METHODS: One hundred three SR TKAs were performed by a single surgeon between 
August 2008 and December 2012. A propensity score matching algorithm was used to 
select 103 MR TKAs performed during the same period. Preoperative and 
postoperative variables such as standardized knee and quality of life scores 
were captured prospectively and then analyzed via both the Student's t-test and 
paired t-test to look for statistically significant differences between the SR 
and MR patient groups.
RESULTS: At 2 years postoperatively, there was no statistically significant 
difference between the SR and MR patient populations in knee extension, Oxford 
Knee Score, Knee Society Clinical Rating Scores, and the Physical Component 
Summary of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). There was a statistically 
significant difference between the two patient groups in postoperative knee 
flexion in favor of the MR design ( p = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: While an SR femoral implant design has several theoretical 
biomechanical advantages, postoperative standardized KSCs and quality of life 
scores in this single-surgeon series do not show a clear advantage of one design 
over the other.

BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab has shown significant survival benefits in treating 
chemotherapy-naïve non-small-cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC) with increased 
level of PD-L1 expression. This analysis aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment for patients with 
PD-L1 positive NSCLC from the UK health care perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model with progression-free, progressive disease and death 
states was developed. Clinical parameters were informed by the KEYNOTE-024 
trial. Utility values were sourced from published literature. Cost data 
including drug acquisition costs, disease management costs, and adverse event 
costs were derived from British National Formulary and published literature. The 
model was run until 99% patients died. Both health outcomes and costs were 
discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to address the uncertainties around model 
parameters.
RESULTS: In the base case, pembrolizumab is projected to increase patient's life 
expectancy by 1.32 life-years over chemotherapy (2.45 vs. 1.13) and 0.83 QALYs 
(1.55 vs. 0.71) at an additional cost of £72,465, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £86,913/QALY. When parameters were varied in the 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, results are most sensitive to duration of 
median overall survival in both groups. Probability sensitivity analyses showed 
that using a willingness-to-pay threshold of £50,000 per QALY, the probability 
of pembrolizumab being cost-effective is 29.4%.
CONCLUSION: Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of £50,000, pembrolizumab is 
not cost-effective at its current list price and a discount of 50% or more is 
required for it to be cost-effective comparing to commonly prescribed 
chemotherapy. Risk-sharing contracts may be helpful in resolving some of the 
underlying uncertainty associated with the long-term survival and varying extent 
of patient response.

BACKGROUND: Despite wide popularity of football, there is a paucity of 
scientific evidence explaining the relationship between being a competitive 
footballer and life expectancy.
AIM: The study analyses and compares cause-specific mortality of Polish male 
elite footballers and the general Polish male population.
METHODS: Data regarding of 455 elite footballers who died between 1990 and 2015 
were retrospectively analysed. The cause of death was established based on the 
official data from the Polish Central Statistical Office. The control group 
consisted of men from the general male population in Poland who died in the 
sampled period at the age of 25 years or more.
RESULTS: The mean age at death turned out to be higher for footballers than 
controls (70.2 vs. 67.4 years). Cardiovascular diseases were a more common cause 
of death among footballers than in the general male population, both in the 
subgroup of subjects who died under the age of 65 years and in those who were at 
least 65 years old at the time of death (46.9% vs. 32.3% and 61.3% vs. 53.3%, 
respectively). A detailed analysis of cause-specific cardiovascular mortality 
revealed that acute myocardial infarction caused more deaths (odds ratio [OR] 
1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.68) and hypertensive disease caused 
less deaths (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05-0.79) among athletes than in the general male 
population. A trend analysis has shown that the level of cardiovascular 
mortality among footballers is falling.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results indicate excess cardiovascular mortality among 
Polish elite footballers.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between 
educational attainment and life expectancy in 18 countries in MENA region.
METHODS: We used World Bank database for a panel of 18 MENA countries during the 
years 1995 to 2009. We used Life Expectancy at Birth, as the key health care 
output measure. Additionally, we used six health care input independent 
variables. All variables were transformed into natural logarithms. We estimated 
the production function using Cobb-Douglas function.
RESULTS: Results indicate that 1% increase in educational attainment of males 25 
to 34 years old, males 25 years and older, females 25 to 34 years old, females 
25 years and older, and females aged 15 to 44 years old will increase life 
expectancy by 0.14%, 0.07%, 0.04%, 0.03%, and 0.04%, respectively, while 
everything else remains constant.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that for MENA region countries investing in 
education to broaden access would improve health outcomes and life expectancy. 
Boosting educational attainment for both male and female population may close 
the life expectancy gaps between the MENA region and other developed countries, 
and males and females within the same country. Education attainment has the 
potential to be a social remedy for better health outcomes in MENA countries.

Glioblastoma multiforme, a type of deadly brain cancer, originates most commonly 
from astrocytes found in the brain. Current multimodal treatments for 
glioblastoma minimally increase life expectancy, but significant advancements in 
prognosis have not been made in the past few decades. Here we investigate 
cellular reprogramming for inhibiting the aggressive proliferation of 
glioblastoma cells. Cellular reprogramming converts one differentiated cell type 
into another type based on the principles of regenerative medicine. In this 
study, we used cellular reprogramming to investigate whether small molecule 
mediated reprogramming could convert glioblastoma cells into neurons. We 
investigated a novel method for reprogramming U87MG human glioblastoma cells 
into terminally differentiated neurons using a small molecule cocktail 
consisting of forskolin, ISX9, CHIR99021 I-BET 151, and DAPT. Treating U87MG 
glioblastoma cells with this cocktail successfully reprogrammed the malignant 
cells into early neurons over 13 days. The reprogrammed cells displayed 
morphological and immunofluorescent characteristics associated with neuronal 
phenotypes. Genetic analysis revealed that the chemical cocktail upregulates the 
Ngn2, Ascl1, Brn2, and MAP2 genes, resulting in neuronal reprogramming. 
Furthermore, these cells displayed decreased viability and lacked the ability to 
form high numbers of tumor-like spheroids. Overall, this study validates the use 
of a novel small molecule cocktail for reprogramming glioblastoma into 
nonproliferating neurons.

AIMS: This analysis investigated the cost-effectiveness of panitumumab plus 
mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin) compared with bevacizumab 
plus mFOLFOX6 in the first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was developed from a 
third-party payer perspective in the US and was implemented using a partitioned 
survival model with health states for first-line treatment (progression-free), 
disease progression with and without subsequent active treatment, and death. 
Survival analyses of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC from the PEAK head-to-head 
clinical trial of panitumumab vs bevacizumab were performed to estimate time in 
the model health states. Additional data from PEAK informed the amount of each 
drug consumed, duration of therapy, subsequent therapy use, and toxicities 
related to mCRC treatment. Literature and US public data sources were used to 
estimate unit costs associated with treatment and duration of subsequent active 
therapies. Utility weights were calculated from patient-level data from 
panitumumab trials in the first-, second-, and third-line settings. A life-time 
perspective was taken with future costs and outcomes discounted at 3% per annum. 
Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Compared with bevacizumab, the use of panitumumab resulted in an 
incremental cost of US $60,286, and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) of 0.445, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US $135,391 in favor 
of panitumumab. Results were sensitive to wastage and dose rounding assumptions 
modeled.
LIMITATIONS: Progression-free and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the 
follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves. Costs and 
quality of life were estimated from multiple and different data sources.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of panitumumab in extending progression-free and 
overall survival and improving quality of life makes it a cost-effective option 
for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC compared with 
bevacizumab.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Telephonic Health Coaching and 
Financial Incentives (THC + FI) to promote physical activity in total knee 
replacement recipients.
DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a computer simulation of knee 
osteoarthritis, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of THC + FI compared to usual 
care. We derived transition probabilities, utilities, and costs from trial data. 
We conducted lifetime analyses from the healthcare perspective and discounted 
all cost-effectiveness outcomes by 3% annually. The primary outcome was the 
Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), defined as the ratio of the 
differences in costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) between strategies. 
We considered ICERs <$100,000/QALY to be cost-effective. We conducted one-way 
sensitivity analyses that varied parameters across their 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) and limited the efficacy of THC + FI to 1 year or to 9 months. We 
also conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), simultaneously 
varying cost, utilities, and transition probabilities.
RESULTS: THC + FI had an ICER of $57,200/QALY in the base case and an ICER below 
$100,000/QALY in most deterministic sensitivity analyses. THC + FI 
cost-effectiveness depended on assumptions about long-term efficacy; when 
efficacy was limited to 1 year or to 9 months, the ICER was $93,300/QALY or 
$121,800/QALY, respectively. In the PSA, THC + FI had an ICER below 
$100,000/QALY in 70% of iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available information, THC + FI might be a 
cost-effective alternative to usual care. However, the uncertainty surrounding 
this choice is considerable, and further research to reduce this uncertainty may 
be economically justified.

Following the involvement of CHCHD10 in FrontoTemporal-Dementia-Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (FTD-ALS) clinical spectrum, a founder mutation (p.Gly66Val) 
in the same gene was identified in Finnish families with late-onset spinal motor 
neuronopathy (SMAJ). SMAJ is a slowly progressive form of spinal muscular 
atrophy with a life expectancy within normal range. In order to understand why 
the p.Ser59Leu mutation, responsible for severe FTD-ALS, and the p.Gly66Val 
mutation could lead to different levels of severity, we compared their effects 
in patient cells. Unlike affected individuals bearing the p.Ser59Leu mutation, 
patients presenting with SMAJ phenotype have neither mitochondrial myopathy nor 
mtDNA instability. The expression of CHCHD10S59L mutant allele leads to 
disassembly of mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) 
with mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of cristae in patient fibroblasts. We 
also show that G66V fibroblasts do not display the loss of MICOS complex 
integrity and mitochondrial damage found in S59L cells. However, S59L and G66V 
fibroblasts show comparable accumulation of phosphorylated mitochondrial TDP-43 
suggesting that the severity of phenotype and mitochondrial damage do not depend 
on mitochondrial TDP-43 localization. The expression of the CHCHD10G66V allele 
is responsible for mitochondrial network fragmentation and decreased sensitivity 
towards apoptotic stimuli, but with a less severe effect than that found in 
cells expressing the CHCHD10S59L allele. Taken together, our data show that 
cellular phenotypes associated with p.Ser59Leu and p.Gly66Val mutations in 
CHCHD10 are different; loss of MICOS complex integrity and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, but not TDP-43 mitochondrial localization, being likely essential 
to develop a severe motor neuron disease.

Expected Lifetime in Different Employment Statuses: Evidence From the Economic 
Boom-and-Bust Cycle in Spain.

This article analyses the impact of the recent economic crisis on the expected 
time spent in different employment statuses in Spain. Using data from the 
Economically Active Population Survey and life tables, we estimate the expected 
time in work, unemployment, retirement, and other types of economic inactivity 
during the economic boom-and-bust cycle. Differences in expected years of life 
spent in different employment statuses are decomposed into effects of mortality 
and employment behavior. Our results show that men's working life expectancy is 
much more exposed to economic fluctuations. The impact of the ebbs and flows of 
the business cycle among women is mitigated by the long-term female trend of 
growing participation in the labor market associated with the increasing 
educational attainment of women. In addition, the improvement in mortality only 
partially contributes to gains in time spent in each status, while the main 
effects correspond to changes in labor market participation.

Lung cancer is predominantly a disease that affects the elderly; about 30-40% of 
lung cancers are diagnosed in patients aged 70 or more. The increasing number of 
elderly patients over the next decades is generating a new social and health 
problem; despite that, these patients are underrepresented in clinical trials 
and undertreated in clinical practice. Areas covered: The main difficulty in 
treating elderly patients is to maximize the therapy benefits while minimizing 
the treatment risk. Elderly patients show a vulnerable clinical profile due to 
the higher prevalence of comorbid disease, higher polypharmacy interactions and 
aged organ dysfunction that increase the risk of mortality and toxicity with 
cancer treatments compared to younger patients. Expert commentary: The choice to 
treat or not to treat elderly patients cannot be taken only on the basis of the 
chronological age. Thus, the clinical approach should be to select patients who 
are effectively suitable for treatment having a better individual functional 
reserve and a better life expectancy. Elderly patients are a heterogeneous 
population and those who are fit to receive cancer treatment can be treated 
similarly to younger patients.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate cost-utility of baroreflex activation 
therapy (BAT) using the Barostim neo™ device (CVRx Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) 
compared with optimized medical management in patients with advanced chronic 
heart failure (NYHA class III) who were not eligible for treatment with cardiac 
resynchronization therapy, from a statutory health insurance perspective in 
Germany over a lifetime horizon.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed using the combination of a 
decision tree and the Markov process. The model included transitions between New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) health states, each of which is associated with a 
risk of mortality, hospitalization, cost, and quality of life. The effectiveness 
of BAT was projected through relative risks for mortality (obtained by 
application of patient-level data to the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic 
Heart Failure risk prediction model) and hospitalization owing to worsening of 
heart failure (obtained from BAT Randomized Clinical Trial). All patients were 
in NYHA class III at baseline.
RESULTS: BAT led to an incremental cost of €33,185 (95% credible interval [CI] 
€24,561-38,637) and incremental benefits of 1.78 [95% CI 0.45-2.71] life-years 
and 1.19 [95% CI 0.30-1.81] quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). This resulted 
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €27,951/QALY (95% CI 
€21,357-82,970). BAT had a 59% probability of being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €35,000/QALY (but 84% at a threshold of 
€52,000/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: BAT can be cost-effective in European settings in those not 
eligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy among patients with advanced 
heart failure.

SETTING: We proposed to: 1) introduce an intermediate-susceptible, 
dose-dependent (ISDD) category for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; and 2) 
treat patients with M. tuberculosis infection in this category with a high dose 
of rifampicin (RMP) and isoniazid (INH).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of our strategy on quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALY) and costs in a low-income country with a high prevalence of 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (Belarus) and a high-income, low 
MDR-TB prevalence country (The Netherlands).
DESIGN: A Markov model comprising 14 health states was used to simulate 
treatment outcomes and costs accrued over 5 years for a hypothetical cohort of 
10 000 patients. One-way sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis and a scenario analysis were also performed.
RESULTS: Our strategy was shown to be cost-effective for Belarus, but not for 
the Netherlands. At a willingness-to-pay of 50 000 euros per QALY, the 
probability of our strategy being cost-effective was 50% for the Netherlands and 
57% for Belarus.
CONCLUSION: The study shows that our strategy could be cost-effective and more 
efficacious. However, more studies are needed on the outcomes of using higher 
doses of INH and RMP.

BACKGROUND: To determine the most appropriate pancreatic drainage method, by 
investigating differences in 12-month clinical outcomes in patients implanted 
with external and internal pancreatic stents as an extension to a previous study 
on short-term outcome.
METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled 213 patients who 
underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with duct to mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy 
between August 2010 and January 2014 (NCT01023594). Of the 185 patients 
followed-up for 12 months, 97 underwent external and 88 underwent internal 
stenting. Their long-term clinical outcomes were compared.
RESULTS: Overall late complication rates were similar in the external and 
internal stent groups (P = 0.621). The percentage of patients with >50% atrophy 
of the remnant pancreatic volume after 12 months was similar in both groups 
(P = 0.580). Factors associated with pancreatic exocrine or endocrine function, 
including stool elastase level (P = 0.571) and rate of new-onset diabetes 
(P = 0.179), were also comparable. There were no significant between-group 
differences in quality of life, as evaluated by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ PAN26 
questionnaires.
CONCLUSION: External and internal stents showed comparable long-term, as well as 
short-term clinical outcomes, including late complication rates, preservation of 
pancreatic duct diameters, pancreatic volume changes with functional 
derangements, and quality of life after surgery.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of successfully treated human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected individuals is approaching normal longevity. The growing HIV 
population ≥50 years of age is now at risk of developing HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder, acquiring coinfection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
and engaging in hazardous drinking or drug consumption that can adversely affect 
trajectories of the healthy aging of brain structures.
METHODS: This cross-sectional/longitudinal study quantified regional brain 
volumes from 1101 magnetic resonance imaging scans collected over 14 years in 
549 participants (25 to 75 years of age): 68 HIV-infected individuals without 
alcohol dependence, 60 HIV-infected individuals with alcohol dependence, 222 
alcohol-dependent individuals, and 199 control subjects. We tested 1) whether 
localized brain regions in HIV-infected individuals exhibited accelerated aging, 
or alternatively, nonaccelerated premature aging deficits; and 2) the extent to 
which alcohol or substance dependence or HCV coinfection altered brain aging 
trajectories.
RESULTS: The HIV-infected cohort exhibited steeper declining volume trajectories 
than control subjects, consistently in the frontal cortex. Nonaccelerated volume 
deficits occurred in the temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate regions of 
all three diagnostic groups. Alcohol and drug dependence comorbidities and HCV 
coinfection exacerbated HIV-related volume deficits. Accelerated age 
interactions in frontal and posterior parietal volumes endured in HIV-infected 
individuals free of alcohol or substance dependence and HCV infection 
comorbidities. Functionally, poorer HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder 
scores and Veterans Aging Cohort Study indices correlated with smaller regional 
brain volumes in the HIV-infected individuals without alcohol dependence and 
alcohol-dependent groups.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection itself may confer a heightened risk of accelerated 
brain aging, potentially exacerbated by HCV coinfection and substance 
dependency. Confirmation would require a prospective study with a preinfection 
baseline.

In the context of high adult mortality and an immense impact on the health 
burden of Zambia, a decomposition analysis of age- and cause-specific mortality 
in age group 15-59 was performed to determine the contributions to the gap in 
life expectancy at birth between males and females. Previous studies on 
decomposition have examined income groups, ethnicity, and regional differences' 
contributions to gaps in life expectancy, but not the adult mortality age group 
15-59. These studies focus on developed countries and few on developing 
countries. Arriaga's decomposition method was applied to 2010 census and 
2010-2012 sample vital registration with verbal autopsy survey (SAVVY) data to 
decompose contributions of age- and cause-specific adult mortality to the gap in 
life expectancy at birth between males and females. The decomposition analysis 
revealed that mortality was higher among males than females and concentrated in 
age groups 20-49. Age- and cause-specific adult mortality contributed 
positively, 50% of the years to the gap in life expectancy at birth between 
males and females. Major cause-specific mortality contributors to the gap in 
life expectancy were infectious and parasitic diseases (1.17 years, 26.3%), 
accidents and injuries (0.54 years, 12.2%), suicide and violence (0.30 years, 
6.8%). Female HIV mortality offset male mortality. Neoplasms deaths among 
females contributed negatively to the gap in life expectancy (-0.22 years, 
-5.4%). Accidents, injuries, suicide, and violence are emerging major causes of 
death in age group 20-49 in Zambia which health policy and programmes should 
target.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking cessation improves life expectancy at any age. There is 
some evidence that elderly smokers have at least as good a chance of 
successfully stopping as other smokers but direct comparisons with long-term 
follow up are rare. This study aimed to compare success rates up to 3 years in 
smokers aged 65+ versus other adult smokers with and without adjustment for a 
range of other smoker characteristics.
METHODS: This was a prospective study of 1065 smokers who attended a 
stop-smoking clinic in Taiwan. Participants (896 < 65 years, 169 65+ years) were 
followed up by telephone 3, 6, 12 and 36 months after the initial quit date. 
Prolonged abstinence (abstinent at all follow-ups) and point prevalence 
abstinence (7 days prior to final follow up) were compared between 'elderly' 
participants aged 65+ years versus 'non-elderly' participants aged <65 years 
with and without adjustment for a range of baseline smoker characteristics (sex, 
educational level, previous quit attempts, cigarette dependence score). 
Non-responders were considered to be smoking.
RESULTS: Prolonged 36-month abstinence rates were 20.1% (N = 34) and 15.3% 
(N = 137) in the elderly and non-elderly participants respectively (p = 0.137). 
Point prevalence 36-month abstinence rates were 37.3% (N = 63) and 26.5% 
(N = 237) in the elderly and non-elderly participants respectively (p = 0.005). 
The odds ratios comparing elderly versus non-elderly abstinence rates after 
adjustment for baseline variables were 1.17 (95%CI = 0.75-1.83) and 1.52 
(95%CI = 1.05-2.20) for prolonged abstinence and point prevalence abstinence 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly smokers attending smoker clinics in Taiwan appear to be at 
least as likely to achieve long-term abstinence as other adult smokers.

Varroa is an external parasitic mite of honey bees and is a vector of multiple 
viruses that can severely weaken or cause the failure of western honey bee 
colonies if untreated. Effective Varroa control is dependent upon a thorough 
understanding of Varroa biology, including how Varroa move between host 
colonies. Here, we highlight that drone (male) honey bees may also play a role 
in Varroa dispersal. Drones were collected and the number of Varroa per 100 
drones was calculated for each of five drone congregation areas (mating sites). 
This study is the first to confirm that drones present at drone congregation 
areas do carry Varroa. Further experimentation is needed to determine the extent 
to which drone-mediated movement may play a role in Varroa life history and/or 
to develop practical management strategies to limit drone-mediated movement of 
Varroa between honey bee hives.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic illness that requires continuing medical 
care and patient self-management education to prevent acute complications and to 
reduce the risk of long-term complications. The number of people with diabetes 
is increasing due to population growth, ageing, urbanisation and increasing 
prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity. Apart from currently available 
therapeutic options, many herbal medicines have been recommended for the 
treatment of diabetes. Herbal drugs are prescribed widely because of their 
effectiveness, less side effects and relatively low cost. Several pharmacopoeias 
have provided parameters to maintain quality and standardise procedures in 
identification/authentication of herbal inputs and their products. Available 
literature related to folklore medicine used in the treatment of diabetes 
extended to nanoformulation of herbal drugs up to date was cited. The use of 
bioactive compounds leads to new hope to improve the life expectancy and health 
status of the population for the formulation of novel drugs. Recently, many 
studies have shown that nanotechnology has the potential to be used in different 
biological and medical applications, mainly as targeted drug delivery systems to 
minimise and delay the chronic effects of diabetes. Herein, the authors 
presented a thorough review of the available herbal medicines and the 
possibilities of developing their nanoformulations in the treatment of DM.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and cost-effective 
outcomes of the open Lichtenstein repair (OL) and laparoscopic trans-abdominal 
preperitoneal (TAPP) repair for bilateral inguinal hernias.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A cost-effective analysis of laparoscopic versus open 
inguinal hernia repair is still not well addressed, especially regarding 
bilateral hernia.
METHODS: This is a clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis within a randomized 
prospective study conducted at Sanchinarro University Hospital.Cases of primary, 
reducible bilateral inguinal hernia were included and randomized using a simple 
randomization program.The outcome parameters included surgical and postoperative 
costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost per QALY gained 
or the incremental cost effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: Between March 2013 and January 2017, 165 patients were enrolled in this 
study (81 of them underwent TAPP and 84 OL).The TAPP procedure had less early 
postoperative pain (P = 0.037), a shorter length of stay (P = 0.001), and fewer 
postoperative complications (P = 0.002) when compared with the OL approach. The 
overall cost of TAPP procedure was higher compared with the OL cost 
(1,683.93&OV0556; vs 1192.83&OV0556;, P = 0.027). The mean QALYs at 1 year for 
TAPP (0.8094) was higher than that associated with OL (0.6765) (P = 0.018). At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 &OV0556; and 30,000 &OV0556;, there was a 
95.38% and 97.96% probability that TAPP was more cost-effective relative to OL.
CONCLUSIONS: The TAPP procedure for bilateral inguinal hernia appears to be more 
cost-effective compared with OL.

Purpose The incidence of infection-associated cancers and lethality of cancers 
amenable to treatment are closely correlated with the income of countries. We 
analyzed a core part of this global cancer divide-the distribution of premature 
mortality across country income groups and cancers-applying novel approaches to 
measure avoidable mortality and identify priorities for public policy. Methods 
We analyzed avoidable cancer mortality using set lower- and upper-bound age 
limits of 65 and 75 years (empirical approach), applying cancer-specific and 
country income group-specific ages of death (feasibility approach), and applying 
cancer-specific ages of death of high-income countries to all low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs; social justice approach). We applied these 
methods to 2015 mortality data on 16 cancers for which prevention is possible 
and/or treatment is likely to result in cure or significant increase in life 
expectancy. Results At least 30% and as much as 50% of cancer deaths are 
premature, corresponding to between 2.6 and 4.3 million deaths each year, and 
70% to 80% are concentrated in LMICs. Using the feasibility approach, 36% of 
cancer deaths are avoidable; with the social justice approach, 45% of cancer 
deaths are avoidable. Five cancer types-breast, colorectal, lung, liver, and 
stomach-account for almost 75% of avoidable cancer deaths in LMICs and 
worldwide. Conclusion Each year, millions of premature cancer deaths could be 
avoided with interventions focused on four priority areas: infection-associated 
cancers, lifestyle and risk factors, women's cancers, and children's cancers. 
Our analysis of the global burden and the specific cancer types associated with 
avoidable cancer mortality suggests significant opportunities for health systems 
to redress the inequity of the global cancer divide.

OBJECTIVE: Hospital-acquired pressure injuries are localised skin injuries that 
cause significant mortality and are costly. Nursing best practices prevent 
pressure injuries, including time-consuming, complex tasks that lack payment 
incentives. The Braden Scale is an evidence-based stratification tool nurses use 
daily to assess pressure-injury risk. Our objective was to analyse the 
cost-utility of performing repeated risk-assessment for pressure-injury 
prevention in all patients or high-risk groups.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using Markov modelling from US societal and 
healthcare sector perspectives within a 1-year time horizon.
SETTING: Patient-level longitudinal data on 34 787 encounters from an academic 
hospital electronic health record (EHR) between 2011 and 2014, including daily 
Braden scores. Supervised machine learning simulated age-adjusted transition 
probabilities between risk levels and pressure injuries.
PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalised adults with Braden scores classified into five risk 
levels: very high risk (6-9), high risk (10-11), moderate risk (12-14), at-risk 
(15-18), minimal risk (19-23).
INTERVENTIONS: Standard care, repeated risk assessment in all risk levels or 
only repeated risk assessment in high-risk strata based on machine-learning
