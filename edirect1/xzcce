Mammary cancer and pyometra are important health hazards associated with ovary 
conservation in pet dogs. Early ovariohysterectomy may reduce the incidence of 
these two diseases, but an estimate of the extent to which the development of 
mammary cancer or pyometra adversely influences overall longevity is missing. As 
a first step toward addressing this knowledge gap, the results of a historical 
cohort study of Rottweilers that lived in North America are reported. 
Questionnaires completed by owners and veterinarians were used to obtain 
lifetime health and medical information on 242 female Rottweilers, including 
years of lifetime ovary exposure, age at death, and cause of death. To determine 
the extent to which longevity was shortened in females that developed these 
ovary-associated diseases, age-anchored life expectancy-defined as the median 
number of remaining years until death for females alive at specified ages during 
the life course-and years of life lost, a measure of premature mortality, were 
estimated. Mammary carcinoma was diagnosed in 19 (7.9%) females; median age at 
diagnosis was 8.5 years; case fatality was 37%. Pyometra was diagnosed in 16 
(6.6%) females; median age at diagnosis was 5.4 years; case fatality was 7%. 
Median lifetime ovary exposure for the study population was 4.3 years. Although 
risk for developing both diseases increased with longer ovary exposure, longer 
ovary exposure (≥4.3 years) was also associated with an overall longevity 
advantage-a 33% decrease in mortality, living 17 months longer than females with 
shorter ovary exposure (P=0.002). Analysis of age-anchored life expectancy 
showed that at no time points during the life course was the current or future 
diagnosis of mammary carcinoma or pyometra associated with shortened survival 
compared to females who never developed these conditions. This lack of longevity 
disadvantage is an expected result for diseases with late-onset, moderate (<50%) 
case fatality (mammary carcinoma) or low (<10%) case fatality (pyometra). These 
findings fail to support the notion that a strategy, such as elective 
ovariohysterectomy, implemented to reduce the incidence of mammary carcinoma and 
pyometra will beneficially impact overall longevity. It follows that future 
efforts to find and implement effective longevity-promoting interventions should 
look beyond reducing the incidence of a particular disease to considering 
trade-offs.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy of patients with congenital heart disease has 
improved over the past decades, increasing the need for a durable pulmonary 
prosthetic valve. Biological valves in various forms have become the valve of 
choice for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), but structural valve deterioration 
is unavoidable in the long term. Use of a mechanical valve could be an 
alternative, but data on long-term outcomes are sparse.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data on 364 patients with 
mechanical valves implanted in the pulmonary position between 1965 and 2014. The 
data originate from medical centers in Barcelona (Spain), Graz (Austria), 
Groningen (the Netherlands), Munich (Germany), Rochester (United States), Seoul 
(Republic of Korea), and Tehran (Iran).
RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 4.26 years (range, 0-27 years), mean age 
at implantation was 27.16 ± 12.2 years. Tetralogy of Fallot was the most common 
primary cardiac diagnosis, with a subgroup of 69.8%. Freedom from valvular 
thrombosis was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87%-94%) at 5 years and 86% 
(95% CI, 81%-91%) at 10 years post-PVR. With a success rate up to 88%, 
thrombolysis was a successful therapy. Freedom from reoperation was 97% (95% CI, 
94%-99%) at 5 years post-PVR and 91% (95% CI, 85%-95%) at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical PVR is associated with a limited risk of valvular 
thrombosis. Thrombolysis was an effective treatment in the majority.

Significant improvement in the survival of patients with CF has been achieved in 
the last decades. The improved clinical status of the patients is mainly the 
result of a better understanding of the natural course of infection and 
inflammation in CF that has led to the implementation of strategies that 
increase the life expectancy and quality of life of the patients. These 
strategies include prompt diagnosis, timely and aggressive nutritional support, 
augmentation of MCC and improved mucous drainage, initiation of antimicrobial 
and anti-inflammatory therapy as soon as possible, early treatment of acute 
exacerbations, implementation of effective hygienic measures in and outside CF 
centers and prompt identification and treatment of CF-related complications. 
Treatment at a specialized CF center by a multidisciplinary dedicated team, 
including frequent visits, and periodic routine tests are essential to detect 
and treat early changes. Adherence to these therapies is challenging. 
Maintaining patients in optimal status will allow them to benefit from future 
treatments designed to correct or modify the basic genetic defect associated 
with CFTR by gene replacement therapy or pharmacological interventions currently 
under development. These new therapies are expected to further increase life 
expectancy of the patients.

OBJECTIVES: Pneumonia is the largest infectious cause of death in children under 
5 years globally, and limited resource settings bear an overwhelming proportion 
of this disease burden. Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP), an 
accepted supportive therapy, is often thought of as cost-prohibitive in these 
settings. We hypothesise that bCPAP is a cost-effective intervention in a 
limited resource setting and this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness 
of bCPAP, using Malawi as an example.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: District and central hospitals in Malawi.
PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 1 month-5 years with severe pneumonia, as defined by 
WHO criteria.
INTERVENTIONS: Using a decision tree analysis, we compared standard of care 
(including low-flow oxygen and antibiotics) to standard of care plus bCPAP.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: For each treatment arm, we determined 
the costs, clinical outcomes and averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
We assigned input values from a review of the literature, including applicable 
clinical trials, and calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the cost of bCPAP per patient was $15 per 
day and $41 per hospitalisation, with an incremental net cost of $64 per 
pneumonia episode. bCPAP averts 5.0 DALYs per child treated, with an ICER of 
$12.88 per DALY averted compared with standard of care. In one-way sensitivity 
analyses, the most influential uncertainties were case fatality rates (ICER 
range $9-32 per DALY averted). In a multi-way sensitivity analysis, the median 
ICER was $12.97 per DALY averted (90% CI, $12.77 to $12.99).
CONCLUSION: bCPAP is a cost-effective intervention for severe paediatric 
pneumonia in Malawi. These results may be used to inform policy decisions, 
including support for widespread use of bCPAP in similar settings.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of substitution of inpatient 
care from medical doctors (MDs) to physician assistants (PAs).
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis embedded within a multicentre, 
matched-controlled study. The traditional model in which only MDs are employed 
for inpatient care (MD model) was compared with a mixed model in which, besides 
MDs, PAs are also employed (PA/MD model).
SETTING: 34 hospital wards across the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 2292 patients were followed from admission until 1 month after 
discharge. Patients receiving daycare, terminally ill patients and children were 
excluded.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: All direct healthcare costs from day of 
admission until 1 month after discharge. Health outcome concerned 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which was measured with the EuroQol five 
dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D).
RESULTS: We found no significant difference for QALY gain (+0.02, 95% CI -0.01 
to 0.05) when comparing the PA/MD model with the MD model. Total costs per 
patient did not significantly differ between the groups (+€568, 95% CI -€254 to 
€1391, p=0.175). Regarding the costs per item, a difference of €309 per patient 
(95% CI €29 to €588, p=0.030) was found in favour of the MD model regarding 
length of stay. Personnel costs per patient for the provider who is primarily 
responsible for medical care on the ward were lower on the wards in the PA/MD 
model (-€11, 95% CI -€16 to -€6, p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the cost-effectiveness on wards managed by 
PAs, in collaboration with MDs, is similar to the care on wards with traditional 
house staffing. The involvement of PAs may reduce personnel costs, but not 
overall healthcare costs.

BACKGROUND: The appropriate management of breast cancer risk in BRCA mutation 
carriers following ovarian cancer diagnosis remains unclear. We sought to 
determine the survival benefit and cost effectiveness of risk-reducing 
mastectomy (RRM) among women with BRCA1/2 mutations following stage II-IV 
ovarian cancer.
DESIGN: We constructed a decision model from a third-party payer perspective to 
compare annual screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography 
to annual screening followed by RRM with reconstruction following ovarian cancer 
diagnosis. Survival, overall costs, and cost effectiveness were determined by 
decade at diagnosis using 2015 US dollars. All inputs were obtained from the 
literature and public databases. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
was performed with a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per year of life saved 
(YLS) for RRM increased with age and BRCA2 mutation status, with greater 
survival benefit demonstrated in younger patients with BRCA1 mutations. RRM 
delayed 5 years in 40-year-old BRCA1 mutation carriers was associated with 
5 months of life gained (ICER $72,739/YLS), and in 60-year-old BRCA2 mutation 
carriers was associated with 0.8 months of life gained (ICER $334,906/YLS). In 
all scenarios, $/YLS and mastectomies per breast cancer prevented were lowest 
with RRM performed 5-10 years after ovarian cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: For most BRCA1/2 mutation carriers following ovarian cancer 
diagnosis, RRM performed within 5 years is not cost effective when compared with 
breast cancer screening. Imaging surveillance should be advocated during the 
first several years after ovarian cancer diagnosis, after which point the 
benefits of RRM can be considered based on patient age and BRCA mutation status.

Socially Assistive Robots: Measuring Older Adults' Perceptions.

Beuscher LM, Fan J, Sarkar N, Dietrich MS, Newhouse PA, Miller KF, Mion LC.

To address manpower shortages, health care leaders recommend technology, 
including robots, to facilitate and augment processes for delivery of efficient, 
safe care. Little is known regarding older adults' perceptions of socially 
assistive robots (SARs). Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use 
Technology framework, a survey was developed and tested for capturing older 
adults' likelihood to use SARs. The Robot Acceptance Survey (RAS) comprises 
three subscales: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Attitude. Older 
adults completed the RAS pre- and post-experimental procedure with a SAR. 
Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the subscales ranged from 0.77 to 0.89. 
Subscales were sensitive to change, with more positive reactions after exposure 
to SAR activities. Future studies must identify robotic programming capable of 
providing cognitive, physical, and social assistance, as well as person-, 
activity-, situation-, and robot-specific factors that will influence older 
adults' acceptance of SARs. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 43(12), 35-43.].

Pneumococcal diseases are associated with a significant clinical and economic 
burden. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) has been used for 
the immunization of newborns against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in 
Italy while now, the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D 
conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV-13) are available. The aim of this analysis was to compare the estimated 
health benefits, cost and cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies vs. 
non-vaccination in Italy using the concept of overall vaccine effectiveness. A 
published Markov model was adapted using local data wherever available to 
compare the impact of neonatal pneumococcal vaccination on epidemiological and 
economic burden of invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal diseases, within a 
cohort of newborns from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective. A 
18-year and a 5-year time horizon were considered for the base-case and scenario 
analysis, respectively. PHiD-CV and PCV-13 are associated with the most 
important reduction of the clinical burden, with a potential marginal advantage 
of PHiD-CV over PCV-13. Compared with no vaccination, PHiD-CV is found on the 
higher limit of the usually indicated willingness to pay range (30,000 - 
50,000€/quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained), while the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PCV-13 is slightly above. Compared with 
PCV-13, PHiD-CV would provide better health outcomes and reduce costs even at 
parity price, solely due to its differential effect on the incidence of NTHi 
acute otitis media (AOM). The analysis on a shorter time horizon confirms the 
direction of the base-case.

INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a major public health, 
medical, and societal challenge globally. They present a substantial burden to 
victims, their families, and the society as a whole. Although indicators such as 
incidence or death rates provide insight into the occurrence and outcome of TBIs 
in various populations, they fail to quantify the full extent of their public 
health and societal impact. Measures such as years of life lost (YLLs), which 
quantifies the number of years of life lost because the person dies prematurely 
due to a disease or injury, should be employed to better quantify the population 
impact. The aim of this study was to provide an in-depth analysis of the burden 
of deaths due to TBI by calculating TBI-specific YLLs in 16 European countries, 
analyzing their main causes and demographic patterns, using data extracted from 
death certificates under unified guidelines and collected in a standardized 
manner.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-wide, cross-sectional epidemiological study 
was conducted in 16 European countries to estimate TBI YLLs for the year 2013. 
The data used for all analyses in this study were acquired from the statistical 
office of the European Union (Eurostat). A specifically tailored dataset of 
micro-level data was provided that listed the external cause of death 
(International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision [ICD-10] codes V01-Y98), 
the specific nature of injury (ICD-10 codes S00-T98), the age at death, and sex 
for each death. Overall number of TBI YLLs, crude and age-standardized TBI YLL 
rates, and TBI YLLs per case were calculated stratified for country, sex, and 
age. Pooled analyses were performed in order to estimate summary 
age-standardized rates of TBI YLLs. In order to evaluate the relative importance 
of TBI in the context of all injuries, proportions of TBI YLLs out of overall 
injury YLLs were calculated. The total number of TBI YLLs was estimated by 
extrapolating the pooled crude rate of TBI YLLs in the 16 analyzed countries to 
the total population of the 28 member states of the EU (EU-28). We found that a 
total of 17,049 TBI deaths occurred in 2013 in the 16 analyzed countries. These 
translated into a total of 374,636 YLLs. The pooled age-standardized rate of 
YLLs per 100,000 people per year was 259.1 (95% CI: 205.8 to 312.3) overall, 
427.5 (95% CI: 290.0 to 564.9) in males, and 105.4 (95% CI: 89.1 to 121.6) in 
females. Males contributed substantially more to TBI YLLs than females (282,870 
YLLs, 76% of all TBI YLLs), which translated into a rate ratio of 3.24 (95% CI: 
3.22 to 3.27). Each TBI death was on average associated with 24.3 (95% CI: 22.0 
to 26.6) YLLs overall, 25.6 (95% CI: 23.4 to 27.8) in males and 20.9 (17.9 to 
24.0) in females. Falls and traffic crashes were the most common external causes 
of TBI YLLs. TBI contributed on average 41% (44% in males and 34% in females) to 
overall injury YLLs. Extrapolating our findings, about 1.3 million YLLs were 
attributable to TBI in the EU-28 in 2013 overall, 1.1 million in males and 
271,000 in females. This study is based on administratively collected data from 
16 countries, and despite the efforts to harmonize them to the greatest possible 
extent, there may be differences in coding practices or reporting between 
countries. If present, these would be inherited into our findings without our 
ability to control for them. The extrapolation of the pooled rates from the 16 
countries to the EU-28 should be interpreted with caution.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that TBI-related deaths and YLLs have a 
substantial impact at the individual and population level in Europe and present 
an important societal and economic burden that must not be overlooked. We 
provide information valuable for policy-makers, enabling them to evaluate and 
plan preventive activities and resource allocation, and to formulate and 
implement strategic decisions. In addition, our results can serve as a basis for 
analyzing the overall burden of TBI in the population.

The characterization and quantification of human dental enamel microstructure, 
in both permanent and deciduous teeth, allows us to document crucial growth 
parameters and to identify stressful events, thus contributing to the 
reconstruction of the past life history of an individual. Most studies to date 
have focused on the more accessible post-natal portion of the deciduous dental 
enamel, even though the analysis of prenatal enamel is pivotal in understanding 
fetal growth, and reveals information about the mother's health status during 
pregnancy. This contribution reports new data describing the prenatal enamel 
development of 18 central deciduous incisors from the Imperial Roman necropolis 
of Velia (I-II century CE, Salerno, Italy). Histomorphometrical analysis was 
performed to collect data on prenatal crown formation times, daily secretion 
rates and enamel extension rates. Results for the Velia sample allowed us to 
derive a new regression formula, using a robust statistical approach, that 
describes the average rates of deciduous enamel formation. This can now be used 
as a reference for pre-industrial populations. The same regression formula, even 
when daily incremental markings are difficult to visualize, may provide a clue 
to predicting the proportion of infants born full term and pre-term in an 
archaeological series.

The causal relationships between insulin levels, insulin resistance, and 
longevity are not fully elucidated. Genetic downregulation of 
insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) signaling components can extend 
invertebrate and mammalian lifespan, but insulin resistance, a natural form of 
decreased insulin signaling, is associated with greater risk of age-related 
disease in mammals. We compared Ins2+/- mice to Ins2+/+ littermate controls, on 
a genetically stable Ins1 null background. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses 
of livers from 25-week-old mice suggested potential for healthier aging and 
altered insulin sensitivity in Ins2+/- mice. Halving Ins2 lowered circulating 
insulin by 25%-34% in aged female mice, without altering Igf1 or circulating 
Igf1. Remarkably, decreased insulin led to lower fasting glucose and improved 
insulin sensitivity in aged mice. Moreover, lowered insulin caused significant 
lifespan extension, observed across two diverse diets. Our study indicates that 
elevated insulin contributes to age-dependent insulin resistance and that 
limiting basal insulin levels can extend lifespan.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an ambulance-based referral 
system an dedicated to emergency obstetrics and neonatal care (EmONC) in remote 
sub-Saharan settings.
METHODS: In this prospective study performed in Oromiya Region (Ethiopia), all 
obstetrical cases referred to the hospital with the ambulance were consecutively 
evaluated during a three-months period. The health professionals who managed the 
referred cases were requested to identify those that could be considered as 
undoubtedly effective. Pre and post-referral costs included those required to 
run the ambulance service and the additional costs necessary for the assistance 
in the hospital. Local life expectancy tables were used to calculate the number 
of year saved.
RESULTS: A total of 111 ambulance referrals were recorded. The ambulance was 
undoubtedly effective for 9 women and 4 newborns, corresponding to 336 years 
saved. The total cost of the intervention was 8299 US dollars. The cost per year 
life saved was 24.7 US dollars which is below the benchmarks of 150 and 30 US 
dollars that define attractive and very attractive interventions. Sensitivity 
analyses on the rate of effective referrals, on the costs of the ambulance and 
on the discount rate confirmed the robustness of the result.
CONCLUSIONS: An ambulance-based referral system for EmONC in remote sub-Saharan 
areas appears highly cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Advances in medical, interventional and surgical treatment have 
increased average life expectancy of patients with congenital heart defects. As 
a result a new group of adult patients with congenital cardiac defects requires 
medical rehabilitation. Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are a relevant group 
among these patients. So far, no reports on the effectiveness of specialized 
rehabilitation programmes for MFS patients exist. We implemented an inpatient 
3-week rehabilitation program for MFS patients at the Muehlenberg-Clinic for 
rehabilitation and assessed the medical safety as well as the impact of the 
program on physical fitness and psychological wellbeing of participants by means 
of an observational pilot study. The comprehensive multidisciplinary program 
included medical, physiotherapeutic, psychological and social issues. Two groups 
including 8 and 10 individuals with verified MFS attended the programme. 
Medically adverse events that occurred during the rehabilitation were 
registered. Adverse events were defined as: any new cardiac arrhythmias such as 
atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac syncope or any 
complications located at the aorta. Psychological assessment was performed using 
Short Form-36 (SF-36), hospital anxiety and depression scale and other 
psychometric questionnaires. Medical examinations included assessment of maximum 
power in bicycle ergometry. All assessments were performed at the beginning and 
at the end of the rehabilitation. Psychometric assessments were repeated 1 year 
after the end of the programme for both groups, respectively.
RESULTS: Patients were highly satisfied with the programme and improved in 
almost all psychological and physical fitness assessments. The 
pre-post-comparison resulted in significant positive changes for mental health 
(p < .001 for SF-36 Mental Health), fatigue (p < .05 for Fatigue Severity 
Scale), nociception (p < .05 for SF-36 Pain) and vitality (p < .05 for SF-36 
Vitality). Physical fitness improved from admission to discharge (p < .001 for 
maximum power in bicycle ergometry, p < .05 for maximum nordic walking 
distance). Considerable improvements persisted through 1 year follow-up. Medical 
assessments excluded medical problems or adverse events caused by participation 
in the programme.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, inpatient rehabilitation was both safe and helpful 
for MFS patients. They benefited in terms of physical fitness, health related 
quality of life and in terms of psychological wellbeing. An evaluation of the 
efficacy of the programme in a controlled design as well as further conceptual 
improvements of our current program is desirable.

BACKGROUND: The ginseng berry has various bioactivities, including antidiabetic, 
anticancer, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative properties. Moreover, we have 
revealed that the active antiaging component of the ginseng berry, 
syringaresinol, has the ability to stimulate longevity via gene activation. 
Despite the many known beneficial effects of ginseng, its effects on skin aging 
are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of ginseng and 
the ginseng berry on one of the skin aging processes, melanogenesis, and 
age-related pigment lipofuscin accumulation, to elucidate the mechanism of 
action with respect to antiaging.
METHODS: The human melanoma MNT1 cell line was treated with ginseng root 
extract, ginseng berry extract, or syringaresinol. Then, the cells were analyzed 
using a melanin assay, and the tyrosinase activity was estimated. The 
Caenorhabditis elegans wild type N2 strain was used for the life span assay to 
analyze the antiaging effects of the samples. A lipofuscin fluorescence assay 
was performed during 10 passages with the syringaresinol treatment.
RESULTS: A 7-d treatment with ginseng berry extract reduced melanin accumulation 
and tyrosinase activity more than ginseng root extract. These results may be due 
to the active compound of the ginseng berry, syringaresinol. The antimelanogenic 
activity was strongly coordinated with the activation of the longevity gene 
foxo3a. Moreover, the ginseng berry extract had more potent antiaging effects, 
caused a life span extension, and reduced lipofuscin accumulation.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that these antimelanogenic 
effects and antiaging effects of ginseng berry mediate the activation of 
antioxidation-FoxO3a signaling.

BACKGROUND: The ageing population raises the question whether there is 
a compression or expansion of morbidity.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the development of morbidity and the associated 
outpatient volume of services in outpatient healthcare.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: With a nationwide sample of statutory health insurance 
patients, the development of the documented morbidity and outpatient volume of 
services of the generation 65plus was empirically examined by a retrospective, 
cohort-specific study based on outpatient claims data covering the years 2007 
and 2014.
RESULTS: In 2014 the proportion of multimorbid patients was increased compared 
to chronically ill patients, other users and non-users. A subgroup analysis 
showed declining incidences for nearly all age and gender groups. In total, the 
average outpatient volume of services per patient increased, which is primarily 
attributable to increasing care of multimorbid and deceased patients.
CONCLUSION: High life expectancy leads to a susceptibility for chronic diseases 
and multimorbidity, which indicates an expansion of morbidity in outpatient 
care. The resulting increased need for outpatient care should be covered with 
specific healthcare concepts for chronically ill and multimorbid patients. 
Declining incidences are a positive indication to reinforce health-promoting 
measures for the generation 65plus. To develop specific healthcare offers for 
a heterogeneous generation 65plus, a differentiated analysis for example by 
socioeconomic status and disease patterns is needed.

AIM: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare ocrelizumab vs 
subcutaneous (SC) interferon beta-1a for the treatment of relapsing multiple 
sclerosis (RMS).
METHODS: A Markov cohort model with a 20-year horizon was developed to compare 
ocrelizumab with SC interferon beta-1a from a US payer perspective. A cohort of 
patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) scores of 0-6, who initiated treatment with ocrelizumab or SC interferon 
beta-1a, were entered into the model. The model considered 21 health states: 
EDSS 0-9 in RRMS, EDSS 0-9 in secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), 
and death. Patients with RRMS could transition across EDSS scores, progress to 
SPMS, experience relapses, or die. Transition probabilities within RRMS while 
patients received ocrelizumab or SC interferon beta-1a were based on data from 
the two SC interferon beta-1a-controlled Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials 
of ocrelizumab in RMS. Transitions within RRMS when off-treatment, RRMS-to-SPMS 
transitions, transitions within SPMS, and transitions to death were based on the 
literature. Utilities of health states, disutilities of relapses, costs of 
therapies, and medical costs associated with health states, relapse, and adverse 
events were from the literature and publicly available data sources. The model 
estimated per-patient total costs, incremental cost per life year (LY) gained, 
and incremental cost per quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained. Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were 
conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model results.
RESULTS: Ocrelizumab was associated with a cost savings of $63,822 and longer 
LYs (Δ = 0.046) and QALYs (Δ = 0.556) over a 20-year time horizon. The results 
of the model were robust in the DSA and PSA.
LIMITATIONS: The model did not consider subsequent treatments and their impact 
on disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ocrelizumab is more cost-effective than SC 
interferon beta-1a for the treatment of RMS.

In patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, life expectancy is usually longer than in 
patients with other forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We conducted 
a cohort study in which patients were followed over a long period of time in an 
attempt to identify potential predictors of clinical outcomes. Sixty-seven 
treatment-naïve patients were enrolled (age range = 12-60 years; median age = 33 
years). Baseline demographic, diagnostic, and functional parameters, plasma 
levels of endothelial dysfunction markers, and treatment-related data were 
tested for possible correlations with event-free survival. Patients were started 
on oral PAH drugs at the beginning of follow-up (n = 23), during follow-up 
(n = 33), or remained untreated (n = 11). The duration of follow-up was 
0.54-9.89 years (median = 7.13 years), with an overall survival rate of 82% and 
an event-free survival rate of 70%. The estimated mean for event-free survival 
time was 7.71 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.86-8.55 years). Of the 16 
variables that were analyzed, the duration of exposure to PAH drugs was 
identified as an independent protective factor (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.25 for 
quartiles, 95% CI = 0.14-0.47, P < 0.001). The initial functional class 
(HR = 3.07; 95% CI = 1.01-9.34; P = 0.048), the severity of right ventricular 
dysfunction (HR = 2.51 [mild, moderate or severe dysfunction]; 95% 
CI = 1.22-5.19; P = 0.013) and plasma von Willebrand factor concentration 
(HR = 1.74 for quartiles; 95% CI = 1.07-2.83; P = 0.026) were identified as risk 
factors. The length of exposure to oral PAH therapies influences survival 
favorably in Eisenmenger patients. This may be of interest for communities where 
access to medications is restricted.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and oncological 
outcomes of women with malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) for relapsed ovarian 
cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in all consecutive patients 
admitted at Instituto Valenciano de Oncología, Valencia, Spain, between July 
2013 and July 2016 with MBO for relapsed ovarian cancer and peritoneal 
carcinomatosis. All patients underwent the same protocol of conservative 
management. Surgical treatment was indicated only in selected cases.
RESULTS: There were a total of 22 patients presenting 59 episodes of MBO; 17 
(77.2%) of those patients presented more than 1 episode of MBO. All patients had 
serous epithelial ovarian cancer; 18 (81.8%) were high grade, and 4 (18.2%) 
low-grade tumors. The median (range) number of episodes per patient was 3 
(range, 1-7) with a mean length of hospitalization of 13 (SD, 13.6) days. The 
median time interval between episodes of MBO (54 episodes in 17 patients) was 17 
days (range, 1-727 days). Twenty of 22 patients died with a median overall 
survival time from the first episode of MBO of 95 days (95% confidence interval, 
49-124 days).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MBO due to relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer in the 
peritoneal carcinomatosis setting have a short life expectancy, presenting a 
median of 3 episodes of MBO until death, with a short time interval between 
episodes. These findings show that bowel obstruction can represent a constant 
status over time until death.

Process of Change in Pain-Related Fear: Clinical Insights From a Single Case 
Report of Persistent Back Pain Managed With Cognitive Functional Therapy.

Caneiro JP, Smith A, Rabey M, Moseley GL, O'Sullivan P.

Study Design Single case report with repeated measures over 18 months. 
Background Management of persistent low back pain (PLBP) associated with high 
pain-related fear is complex. This case report aims to provide clinicians with 
insight into the process of change in a person with PLBP and high 
bending-related fear, who was managed with an individualized behavioral approach 
of cognitive functional therapy. Case Description A retired manual worker with 
PLBP believed that his spine was degenerating, that bending would hurt him, and 
that avoidance was the only form of pain control. At baseline, he presented high 
levels of pain-related fear on the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (score, 47/68) 
and a high-risk profile on the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (score, 
61/100). Unhelpful beliefs and behaviors led to a vicious cycle of fear and 
disengagement from valued life activities. Guided behavioral experiments were 
used to challenge his thoughts and protective responses, indicating that his 
behavior was modifiable and the pain controllable. Using a multidimensional 
clinical-reasoning framework, cognitive functional therapy management was 
tailored to target key drivers of PLBP and delivered over 6 sessions in a 
3-month period. Outcomes Over an 18-month clinical journey, he demonstrated 
improvements in bending-related fear, pain expectancy, and pain experience, and 
substantial changes in pain-related fear (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia: 33/68; 
change, -14 points) and risk profile (Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire: 
36/100; change, -25 points). Clinical interviews at 6 and 18 months revealed 
positive changes in mindset, understanding of pain, perceived pain control, and 
behavioral responses to pain. Discussion This case report provides clinicians 
with an insight to using a multidimensional clinical-reasoning framework to 
identify and target the key drivers of the disorder, and to using cognitive 
functional therapy to address unhelpful psychological and behavioral responses 
to pain in a person with PLBP and high pain-related fear. Level of Evidence
