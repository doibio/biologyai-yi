Adult-onset autoimmune (AOA) diabetes pathophysiology starts with immune 
changes, followed by dysglycaemia and overt disease. AOA diabetes can occur as 
classic type 1 diabetes when associated with severe loss of insulin secretion. 
More frequently, it is diagnosed as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a 
slowly progressing form with late onset, a long period not requiring insulin, 
and it is often misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. As its clinical presentation 
varies remarkably and immune markers often lack specificity, it is challenging 
to classify each case ad hoc, especially when insulin treatment is not required 
at diagnosis. Proper care of AOA diabetes aims to prevent complications and to 
improve quality of life and life expectancy. To achieve these goals, attention 
should be paid to lifestyle factors, with the aid of pharmacological therapies 
properly tailored to each individual clinical setting. Given the heterogeneity 
of the disease, choosing the right therapy for AOA diabetes is challenging. Most 
of the trials testing disease-modifying therapies for autoimmune diabetes are 
conducted in people with childhood onset, whereas non-insulin diabetes therapies 
have mostly been studied in the larger population with type 2 diabetes. More 
randomized controlled trials of therapeutic agents in AOA diabetes are needed.

BACKGROUND: Mass community testing for SARS-CoV-2 by lateral flow devices (LFDs) 
aims to reduce prevalence in the community. However its effectiveness as a 
public heath intervention is disputed.
METHOD: Data from a mass testing pilot in the Borough of Merthyr Tydfil in late 
2020 was used to model cases, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths 
prevented. Further economic analysis with a healthcare perspective assessed 
cost-effectiveness in terms of healthcare costs avoided and QALYs gained.
RESULTS: An initial conservative estimate of 360 (95% CI: 311-418) cases were 
prevented by the mass testing, representing a would-be reduction of 11% of all 
cases diagnosed in Merthyr Tydfil residents during the same period. Modelling 
healthcare burden estimates that 24 (16-36) hospitalizations, 5 (3-6) ICU 
admissions and 15 (11-20) deaths were prevented, representing 6.37%, 11.1% and 
8.2%, respectively of the actual counts during the same period. A less 
conservative, best-case scenario predicts 2333 (1764-3115) cases prevented, 
representing 80% reduction in would-be cases. Cost -effectiveness analysis 
indicates 108 (80-143) QALYs gained, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
£2,143 (£860-£4,175) per QALY gained and net monetary benefit of £6.2 m 
(£4.5 m-£8.4 m). In the best-case scenario, this increases to £15.9 m 
(£12.3 m-£20.5 m).
CONCLUSIONS: A non-negligible number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths were 
prevented by the mass testing pilot. Considering QALYs gained and healthcare 
costs avoided, the pilot was cost-effective. These findings suggest mass testing 
with LFDs in areas of high prevalence (> 2%) is likely to provide significant 
public health benefit. It is not yet clear whether similar benefits will be 
obtained in low prevalence settings or with vaccination rollout.

BACKGROUND: Sierra Leone, in West Africa, is one of the poorest developing 
countries in the world. Sierra Leone has experienced several recent challenges 
namely, a civil war from 1991 to 2002, a massive Ebola outbreak from 2014 to 
2016, followed by floods and landslides in 2017.In this study, we quantified the 
burden of disease in Sierra Leone over a 27-year period, from 1990 to 2017.
METHODOLOGY: In this descriptive study, we analysed secondary data from the 
Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study. We quantified patterns of burden of disease, injuries, and risk factors 
in Sierra Leone. We report GBD data and metrics including mortality rates, years 
of life lost and risk factors for all ages and both sexes from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2017, trends of mortality rates for all ages and sexes 
have declined in Sierra Leone although mortality rates remain some of the 
highest when compared to other developing countries. The burden of communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases are greater than the burden 
of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) due to the prevalence of endemic diseases in 
Sierra Leone. The most important CMNNs associated with premature mortality 
included respiratory infections, neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and 
HIV-Aids. Life expectancy has increased from 37 to 52 years.
CONCLUSION: Sierra Leone's health status is gradually improving following the 
civil war and Ebola outbreak. Sierra Leone has a double burden of disease with 
CMNNs leading and NCDs progressively increasing. Despite these challenges, 
Sierra Leone has promising initiatives and programs pursuing the Universal 
Health Coverage 2030 Sustainable Developmental Goals Agenda. There is need for 
accountability of available resources, clear rules and expected roles for 
non-governmental organisations to ensure a level playing field for all actors to 
rebuild the health system.

BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited, rare, progressive disorder of 
children and young adults. It is characterized by ataxia, loss of gait, 
scoliosis, cardiomyopathy, dysarthria and dysphagia, with reduced life 
expectancy. Alterations of respiratory dynamics and parameters are frequently 
observed. However, in the literature there are few, dated studies with small 
cohorts. Our study aims to make an objective analysis of the respiratory 
condition of both early and late stage FRDA patients, looking for correlations 
with the motor, skeletal, speech and genetic aspects of this condition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study is based on the 
collection of clinical and instrumental respiratory data of 44 subjects between 
13 and 51 years attending a tertiary rehabilitation centre in northern Italy. 
The analysis was carried out using Pearson's correlation test, ANOVA test and 
post hoc tests.
RESULTS: Data show the presence of a recurrent pattern of respiratory 
dysfunction of a restrictive type, with reduction in forced vital capacity and 
of flow and pressure parameters. The severity of the respiratory condition 
correlates with the disease severity (measured with disease-specific scales), 
with pneumophonic alterations and with the severity of the thoracic scoliotic 
curve.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory function is impaired at various degrees in FRDA. The 
complex condition of inco-ordination and hyposthenia in FRDA affects daytime and 
night-time respiratory efficiency. We believe that the respiratory deficit and 
the inefficiency of cough are indeed a clinical problem deserving consideration, 
especially in the context of the concomitant postural difficulty and the 
possible presence of dysphagia. Therefore, the rehabilitation project for the 
subject with FRDA should also consider the respiratory function.

New developments in sequencing technology and nucleotide analysis have allowed 
us to make great advances in reconstructing anuran phylogeny. As a clade of 
representative amphibians that have radiated from aquatic to arboreal habitats, 
our understanding of the systematic status and molecular biology of rhacophorid 
tree frogs is still limited. We determined two new mitogenomes for the genus 
Polypedates (Rhacophoridae): P. impresus and P. mutus. We conducted comparative 
and phylogenetic analyses using our data and seven other rhacophorid 
mitogenomes. The mitogenomes of the genera Polypedates, Buergeria, and 
Zhangixalus were almost identical, except that the ATP8 gene in Polypedates had 
become a non-coding region; Buergeria maintained the legacy "LTPF" tRNA gene 
cluster compared to the novel "TLPF" order in the other two genera; and B. 
buergeri and Z. dennysi had no control region (CR) duplication. The resulting 
phylogenetic relationship supporting the above gene rearrangement pathway 
suggested parallel evolution of ATP8 gene loss of function (LoF) in Polypedates 
and CR duplication with concerted evolution of paralogous CRs in rhacophorids. 
Finally, conflicting topologies in the phylograms of 185 species reflected the 
advantages of phylogenetic analyses using multiple loci.

Stem cells are a well-known autologous pluripotent cell source, having excellent 
potential to develop into specialized cells, such as brain, skin, and bone 
marrow cells. The oral cavity is reported to be a rich source of multiple types 
of oral stem cells, including the dental pulp, mucosal soft tissues, periodontal 
ligament, and apical papilla. Oral stem cells were useful for both the 
regeneration of soft tissue components in the dental pulp and mineralized 
structure regeneration, such as bone or dentin, and can be a viable substitute 
for traditionally used bone marrow stem cells. In recent years, several studies 
have reported that plant extracts or compounds promoted the proliferation, 
differentiation, and survival of different oral stem cells. This review is 
carried out by following the PRISMA guidelines and focusing mainly on the 
effects of bioactive compounds on oral stem cell-mediated dental, bone, and 
neural regeneration. It is observed that in recent years studies were mainly 
focused on the utilization of oral stem cell-mediated regeneration of bone or 
dental mesenchymal cells, however, the utility of bioactive compounds on oral 
stem cell-mediated regeneration requires additional assessment beyond in vitro 
and in vivo studies, and requires more randomized clinical trials and case 
studies.

Therapeutic Benefit of Systematic Lymphadenectomy in Node-Negative 
Uterine-Confined Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma: Omission of Adjuvant 
Therapy.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological tract malignancy in 
developed countries, and its incidence has been increasing globally with rising 
obesity rates and longer life expectancy. In endometrial cancer, extrauterine 
disease, in particular lymph node metastasis, is an important prognostic factor. 
Nevertheless, pelvic lymphadenectomy is not considered to have a therapeutic 
benefit, as it did not improve survival in randomized studies. However, 
lymphadenectomy may have a therapeutic benefit if adjuvant therapy can be 
omitted without decreasing oncological outcomes, as the long-term quality of 
life is maintained by avoiding morbidities associated with adjuvant therapy. In 
intermediate- and high-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, adjuvant 
therapy may be safely omitted without decreasing long-term survival by open 
surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy when 
patients are node-negative. Systematic lymphadenectomy may remove undetectable 
low-volume lymph node metastasis in both pelvic and para-aortic regions, and 
open surgery may reduce vaginal recurrence even without vaginal brachytherapy. 
However, lymphadenectomy may not improve survival in elderly patients and 
patients with p53-mutant tumors. In this review, I discuss the characteristics 
of lymph node metastasis, the methods of lymph node assessment, and the 
therapeutic benefits of systematic lymphadenectomy in patients with 
intermediate- and high-risk endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a fundamental antioxidant enzyme that neutralises 
superoxide ions, one of the main reactive oxygen species (ROS). Extremophile 
organisms possess enzymes that offer high stability and catalytic performances 
under a wide range of conditions, thus representing an exceptional source of 
biocatalysts useful for industrial processes. In this study, SODs from the 
thermo-halophilic Aeropyrum pernix (SODAp) and the thermo-acidophilic 
Saccharolobus solfataricus (SODSs) were heterologously expressed in transgenic 
tomato cell cultures. Cell extracts enriched with SODAp and SODSs showed a 
remarkable resistance to salt and low pHs, respectively, together with optimal 
activity at high temperatures. Moreover, the treatment of tuna fillets with 
SODAp-extracts induced an extension of the shelf-life of this product without 
resorting to the use of illicit substances. The results suggested that the 
recombinant plant extracts enriched with the extremozymes could find potential 
applications as dietary supplements in the nutrition sector or as additives in 
the food preservation area, representing a more natural and appealing 
alternative to chemical preservatives for the market.

We studied the effects of human lactoferrin (hLf), a multifunctional protein 
from the transferrin family, on integral (survival, lifespan during the 
experiment, body weight, behavior, subfractional compositions of blood serum) 
and systemic (hemoglobin level, leukocyte number, differential leukocyte count, 
histological structure of the liver and spleen) parameters of the body in mice 
after acute gamma irradiation in a sublethal dose. The experiments were 
performed on male C57BL/6 mice. The mice in the experimental groups were exposed 
to whole-body gamma radiation in a dose of 7.5 Gy from a 60Co source. 
Immediately after irradiation and 24 h after it, some animals received an 
intraperitoneal injection of hLf (4 mg/mouse). Single or repeated administration 
of hLf had a positive pleiotropic effect on irradiated animals: animal survival 
increased from 28% to 78%, and the mean life expectancy during the experiment 
(30 days) increased from 16 to 26 days. A compensatory effect of hLf on 
radiation-induced body weight loss, changes in homeostasis parameters, and a 
protective effect on the structural organization of the spleen were 
demonstrated. These data indicate that Lf has potential as a means of early 
therapy after radiation exposure.

The great importance of diet for health and high life-expectancy is established. 
The impact of nutrients on immune system is a point of growing research 
interest. Recent studies have found pro- and anti-inflammatory properties of 
some diet patterns and nutrients that can be used from the bench to the bedside 
for chronic low-grade inflammatory status correction. In this regard, the 
assessment of potential effects of nutrition on macrophage differentiation, 
proliferation, and functioning in health and disease is highly demanded. In this 
review, we present current data on the effects of nutrients on the macrophage 
functioning.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with short 
life expectancy and no effective therapy. We previously identified upregulated 
miR-124 in NSC-34-motor neurons (MNs) expressing human SOD1-G93A (mSOD1) and 
established its implication in mSOD1 MN degeneration and glial cell activation. 
When anti-miR-124-treated mSOD1 MN (preconditioned) secretome was incubated in 
spinal cord organotypic cultures from symptomatic mSOD1 mice, the dysregulated 
homeostatic balance was circumvented. To decipher the therapeutic potential of 
such preconditioned secretome, we intrathecally injected it in mSOD1 mice at the 
early stage of the disease (12-week-old). Preconditioned secretome prevented 
motor impairment and was effective in counteracting muscle atrophy, glial 
reactivity/dysfunction, and the neurodegeneration of the symptomatic mSOD1 mice. 
Deficits in corticospinal function and gait abnormalities were precluded, and 
the loss of gastrocnemius muscle fiber area was avoided. At the molecular level, 
the preconditioned secretome enhanced NeuN mRNA/protein expression levels and 
the PSD-95/TREM2/IL-10/arginase 1/MBP/PLP genes, thus avoiding the 
neuronal/glial cell dysregulation that characterizes ALS mice. It also prevented 
upregulated GFAP/Cx43/S100B/vimentin and inflammatory-associated miRNAs, 
specifically miR-146a/miR-155/miR-21, which are displayed by symptomatic 
animals. Collectively, our study highlights the intrathecal administration of 
the secretome from anti-miR-124-treated mSOD1 MNs as a therapeutic strategy for 
halting/delaying disease progression in an ALS mouse model.

BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) is a rare, progressive, X-linked, 
inherited genetic disease caused by a functional deficiency of lysosomal 
α-galactosidase, leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in virtually 
all of the body's cell types and fluids. Patients with rare genetic diseases and 
non-specific symptoms often experience substantial diagnostic delays, which can 
negatively impact the prompt initiation of treatment. If FD is not treated 
specifically, end organ damage (such as chronic renal failure, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia, and strokes) impairs quality of life and reduces 
life expectancy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: For 83 consecutive patients with FD referred to the 
Russian reference center for lysosomal storage diseases, family trees were built 
and genetic testing (cascade genotyping) was offered to family members.
RESULTS: The pathogenic GLA variant associated with FD was identified for all 83 
probands. Family testing using cascade genotyping enabled the identification of 
165 additional cases of FD among the tested 331 at-risk family members.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study to have described family screening in a 
large Russian cohort of patients with FD and chronic kidney disease. Raising 
awareness of FD among clinicians is important for earlier diagnosis and specific 
treatment.

Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is rising exponentially in Asia, representing 11% of 
cancer worldwide. This study analysed the influence of CRC on patients’ life 
expectancy (survival and prognosis factors) via clinicopathology data and 
comorbidity status of CRC patients. Methodology: A retrospective study performed 
in HUSM using clinical data from the Surgery unit from 2015 to 2020. The 
demographic and pertinent clinical data were retrieved for preliminary analyses 
(data cleansing and exploration). Demographics and pathological characteristics 
were illustrated using descriptive analysis; 5-year survival rates were 
calculated using Kaplan−Meier methods; potential prognostic variables were 
analysed using simple and multivariate logistic regression analysis conducted 
via the Cox proportional hazards model, while the Charlson Comorbidity Scale was 
used to categorize patients’ disease status. Results: Of a total of 114 CRC 
patients, two-thirds (89.5%) were from Malay tribes, while Indian and Chinese 
had 5.3% each. The 50−69.9 years were the most affected group (45.6%). Overall, 
40.4% were smokers (majorly male (95.7%)), 14.0% ex-smokers, and 45.6% 
non-smokers (p-value = 0.001). The Kaplan−Meier overall 5-year median survival 
time was 62.5%. From the outcomes, patients who were male and >70 years had 
metastasis present, who presented with per rectal bleeding and were classified 
as Duke C; and who has tumour in the rectum had the lowest survival rate. 
Regarding the prognosis factors investigated, “Gender” (adjusted hazard ratio 
(HR): 2.62; 95% CI: 1.56−7.81, p-value = 0.040), “Presence of metastases” (HR: 
3.76; 95% CI: 1.89−7.32, p-value = 0.010), “Metastasis site: Liver” (HR: 5.04; 
95% CI: 1.71−19.05, p-value = 0.039), “Lymphovascular permeation” (HR: 2.94; 95% 
CI: 1.99−5.92, p-value = 0.021), and “CEA-level” (HR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.49−5.80, 
p-value = 0.001) remained significant in the final model for multiple Cox 
proportional hazard regression analyses. There was a significant mean 
association between tumour grades and the patient’s comorbidity status. 
Conclusions: Histopathological factors (gender, metastases presence, site of 
metastases, CEA level, and lymphovascular permeation) showed the best 
prognosis-predicting factors in CRC.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has improved HIV patients' quality of life 
and life expectancy. However, complications have emerged in the form of 
hypertension. In the rural Eastern Cape, there is minimal information about 
HIV-infected people. The current study intended to evaluate the factors 
associated with hypertension in HIV-infected individuals receiving 
antiretroviral therapy in rural areas of South Africa's Eastern Cape.
METHODS: For this cohort study, HIV-positive people taking antiretroviral 
therapy aged 15 and up were recruited at random from several rural locations in 
the Eastern Cape. Using Cox univariate and multivariate analyses, the key 
predictors of hypertension were found.
RESULTS: Of the total participants (n = 361), 53% of individuals had 
hypertension. In the Cox multivariate model, patients that had hypertension 
heredity, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, advanced and severe CD4 
counts, 1TFE and 1T3E regimens, and the male gender were found to be at greater 
risk of hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that hypertension is a 
prevalent concern among HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. HIV 
patients should have their blood pressure checked regularly, and they should be 
screened for high blood pressure and given treatment for it.

This study examines the trends in mortality among Japanese working men, across 
various occupational categories, from 1980 to 2015. A Poisson model of trend, 
occupational category, and step variable was analysed for eight occupational 
categories separately, by cause, to explore the trends in mortality. This study 
found a sharp increase in mortality in the late 1990s, especially among 
professionals and managers. The overall trends in cancer, ischemic heart disease 
(IHD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and suicide mortality decreased across 
almost all occupational categories from 1980 to 2015, although there was an 
increasing trend in cancer of 0.5% among managers. Clerical workers had the 
greatest relative decrease in mortality rates from cancer (-82.9%), IHD 
(-81.7%), and CVD (-89.1%). Japan continues to make gains in lowering mortality 
and extending life expectancy, but its workplace culture must improve to ensure 
that those working at the heart of the Japanese corporate world can also benefit 
from Japan's progress in health. Mortality rates in working-aged Japanese men 
have been declining. However, similar declines are not evident among managers, 
for whom the mortality rate is remaining stable or slightly increasing. There is 
a need to address the needs of managers and improve workplace environments for 
these workers.

BACKGROUND: Participation in sport and physical activity (PA) leads to better 
overall health, increased life expectancy, and decreased mortality rates across 
the lifespan; however, there may be a range of individual, family, and community 
factors that influence PA participation among ONENA children and adolescents 
residing in the 22 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT) and 
Australia. This review aimed to synthesise existing quantitative and qualitative 
literature regarding barriers to and facilitators of PA and sport among ONENA 
youth.
METHODS: The literature was systematically searched to include studies reporting 
barriers to and facilitators of PA and sports participation among ONENA children 
and adolescents aged 0-18 years residing in the 22 PICT and Australia. Using a 
pre-established taxonomy based on the social-ecological model, a deductive 
analysis was performed. Quality appraisal was performed using the mixed methods 
appraisal tool.
RESULTS: Of 1388 articles, 14 studies were included, with 128 ONENA children and 
adolescent participants across the four qualitative studies; 156,581 ONENA 
children and adolescents across the seven quantitative studies; 801 parents, 
children, and adolescents in one quantitative study; and 642 parents in two 
quantitative studies. Of the 14 included studies, none were based in Australia 
and only 10 of the 22 PICT were reported as the participants' residence: Palau, 
New Zealand, Tonga, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, 
Vanuatu, and Fiji. Four studies reported barriers, and another four studies 
reported facilitators of PA and sport, with the remaining studies reporting both 
barriers and facilitators. Overall, there were more barriers reported (30 in 
total) than facilitators (27 in total).
CONCLUSIONS: Research in this area is lacking, with ONENA youth living in 
Australia and 12 PICT not represented. Overall, there were a larger number of 
facilitators experienced at individual and interpersonal levels, while barriers 
were highest at the community level, with the policy level having facilitators 
and barriers equally represented. Programs that offer PA and sport participation 
options with embedded SDT-informed strategies for all family members; that are 
accessible through existing transport and related social, cultural, and physical 
infrastructure; and that are committed to communities through formal co-design 
partnerships are needed, to enhance the PA and sport participation of ONENA 
youth residing in PICT.

The health burden of cancer increases in Uzbekistan as the country develops and 
the life expectancy increases. Management of such a burden requires efficient 
screening, treatment optimization, and investigation of the causes of cancer. 
The Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan formed an advisory consortium, including 
clinical oncology and healthcare management experts from Uzbekistan and South 
Korea, to design a strategy for cancer management. Our consortium has analyzed 
six cancer types with high morbidity and mortality in Uzbekistan by classifying 
them into three categories (breast, cervical (gynecologic cancers), lung, liver 
(cancer common in men), stomach, and colorectal cancers (gastrointestinal 
cancers)). Lung and liver cancers are common causes of death in men after middle 
age-they can yield a serious health burden on the country and ruin the 
livelihood of families. In this review, we will analyze the oncologic literature 
and suggest practical recommendations for the treatment and prevention of lung 
and liver cancer in Uzbekistan. Data from South Korea, which has conducted 
nationwide screening for two decades and made progress in improving prognosis, 
will be discussed as a comparative control.

With already wide disparities in physical health and life expectancy, COVID-19 
presents people with mental illness with additional threats to their health: 
decreased access to health services, increased social isolation, and increased 
socio-economic disadvantage. Each of these factors has exacerbated the risk of 
poor health and early death for people with mental illness post-COVID-19. Unless 
effective primary care and preventative health responses are implemented, the 
physical illness epidemic for this group will increase post the COVID-19 
pandemic. This perspective paper briefly reviews the literature on the impact of 
COVID-19 on service access, social isolation, and social disadvantage and their 
combined impact on physical health, particularly cancer, respiratory diseases, 
heart disease, smoking, and infectious diseases. The much-overlooked role of 
poor physical health on suicidality is also discussed. The potential impact of 
public health interventions is modelled based on Australian incidence data and 
current research on the percentage of early deaths of people living with mental 
illnesses that are preventable. Building on the lessons arising from services' 
response to COVID-19, such as the importance of ensuring access to preventive, 
screening, and primary care services, priority recommendations for consideration 
by public health practitioners and policymakers are presented.

Lower limb ischemic disease (LEAD) affects a significant portion of the 
population, with most patients being asymptomatic. Patient screening is 
necessary because LEAD patients have an increased risk of occurrence of other 
cardiovascular events and manifestations of disease, in terms of leg symptoms 
such as intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia, or amputation. The 
aim of this work was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening using ABI 
diagnostics in asymptomatic patients and its impact on limb symptoms associated 
with LEAD. A discrete event simulation model was created to capture lifetime 
costs and effects. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the health care 
payer, and the effects were calculated as QALYs. A cost-effectiveness analysis 
was performed to compare ABI screening examination and the situation without 
such screening. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis were 
carried out to evaluate the robustness of the results. In the basic setting, the 
screening intervention was a more expensive intervention, at a cost of CZK 
174,010, compared to CZK 70,177 for the strategy without screening. The benefits 
of screening were estimated at 14.73 QALYs, with 14.46 QALYs without screening. 
The final ICER value of CZK 389,738 per QALY is below the willingness to pay 
threshold. Likewise, the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 
of the scenario analysis were below the threshold of willingness to pay, thus 
confirming the robustness of the results. In conclusion, ABI screening appears 
to be a cost-effective strategy for asymptomatic patients aged 50 years when 
compared to the no-screening option.
