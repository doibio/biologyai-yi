OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the association between perinatal factors and 
amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram abnormalities in preterm infants on 
the first day of life.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 60 infants with gestational age 
between 23 and 32 weeks, without malformations. Infants were continuously 
monitored by amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram on the first day of life, 
for at least 3h. The tracings were recorded and analyzed in each column for the 
following: burst-suppression pattern, sleep-wake cycle, and amplitude of the 
lower margin (<3μV or <5μV). The association of maternal complications, mode of 
delivery, birth weight, gestational age, neonatal sex, resuscitation procedures, 
hypothermia on admission, and the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology, Perinatal 
Extension, Version II [SNAPPE-II]) with amplitude-integrated 
electroencephalogram alterations was assessed by multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: A discontinuous pattern occurred in 65% of infants, and a continuous 
pattern occurred in 23%. The burst-suppression pattern was associated with 
vaginal delivery (OR: 7.6; 95% CI: 1.1-53.1) and SNAPPE-II≥40 (OR: 13.1; 95% CI: 
1.8-95.1). A lower margin of the amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram of 
<3μV was also associated with SNAPPE-II≥40 (OR: 10.6, 95% CI: 2.3-49.2), while a 
value <5μV was associated with lower GA (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.76). There 
were no associations between the perinatal variables and the absence of a 
sleep-wake cycle in amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram recordings on the 
first day of life.
CONCLUSION: Biological variables and clinical severity are associated with 
electroencephalographic characteristics of preterm infants on the first day of 
life and should be considered in clinical practice when amplitude-integrated 
electroencephalogram is performed.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a associação entre fatores perinatais e anormalidades no 
eletroencefalograma de amplitude integrada em recém-nascidos prematuros no 
primeiro dia de vida.
MÉTODOS: Este é um estudo transversal de 60 bebês com idade gestacional entre 
23-32 semanas, sem malformações. Os recém-nascidos foram continuamente 
monitorados por eletroencefalograma de amplitude integrada no primeiro dia de 
vida por pelo menos 3 horas. Os traçados foram registrados e analisados em cada 
coluna para: padrão de surto-supressão, ciclo de sono-vigília e amplitude da 
margem inferior (<3 μV ou <5 μV). A associação de complicações maternas, tipo de 
parto, peso ao nascer, idade gestacional, sexo do neonato, procedimentos de 
reanimação, hipotermia na admissão e Escore para Fisiologia Neonatal Aguda, 
Extensão Perinatal, versão II (SNAPPE-II) com alterações no eletroencefalograma 
de amplitude integrada foi avaliada por regressão logística múltipla.
RESULTADOS: Um padrão descontínuo ocorreu em 65% dos recém-nascidos e o padrão 
contínuo ocorreu em 23%. O padrão de surto-supressão foi associado ao parto 
vaginal (OR 7,6; IC95% 1,1-53,1) e SNAPPE-II ≥ 40 (OR 13,1; IC95% 1,8-95,1). Uma 
margem inferior do eletroencefalograma de amplitude integrada <3 μV também foi 
associada com escore SNAPPE-II ≥ 40 (OR 10,6, IC95% 2,3-49,2), enquanto um valor 
<5 μV foi associado com menor IG (OR 0,51, IC 95% 0,34-0,76). Não houve 
associações entre as variáveis perinatais e a ausência de ciclo sono-vigília nas 
gravações de eletroencefalograma de amplitude integrada no primeiro dia de vida.
CONCLUSÃO: As variáveis biológicas e a gravidade clínica estão associadas às 
características eletroencefalográficas dos recém-nascidos prematuros no primeiro 
dia de vida e devem ser consideradas na prática clínica quando o 
eletroencefalograma de amplitude integrada é realizado.

Cost-Effectiveness of Continuous Support From a Layperson During a Woman's First 
Two Births.

Greiner KS, Hersh AR, Hersh SR, Gallagher AC, Caughey AB, Tilden EL.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and health outcomes related to 
continuous support from a layperson during a woman's first two births in a 
theoretical population.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: A theoretical cohort of 1.2 million women based on an 
approximation of annual low-risk, nulliparous, term, singleton births in the 
United States with the assumption that these women have second births. This 
reflects the average number of births per woman in the United States.
METHODS: We designed a cost-effectiveness model to compare outcomes in women 
with continuous support from relatives, friends, or community members with 
minimal to no training (excluding trained doulas) during labor and birth 
compared with outcomes for women with no continuous support. Outcomes included 
mode of birth, uterine rupture, hysterectomy, maternal death, cost, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We derived probabilities from the 
literature and set a cost-effectiveness threshold at $100,000/QALY.
RESULTS: In this theoretical model, continuous support by a layperson during the 
first birth resulted in fewer cesarean births, decreased costs, and increased 
QALYs for the first and subsequent births. Women with support from laypersons 
had 71,090 fewer cesarean births, 35 fewer uterine ruptures, 9 fewer 
hysterectomies, and 16 fewer maternal deaths, which saved $364 million with 
2,673 increased QALYs. Sensitivity analyses showed that continuous support in 
the first birth was cost-effective even when varying the estimate of lost wages 
of the support person up to $708.
CONCLUSION: Continuous labor support from a layperson leads to fewer cesarean 
births, improved outcomes, decreased costs, and increased QALYs. This highlights 
the need to increase women's access to continuous layperson support during labor 
and birth uninhibited by financial and institutional barriers.

BACKGROUND: Late-stage isolated medial knee osteoarthritis can be treated with 
total knee replacement (TKR) or partial knee replacement (PKR). There is high 
variation in treatment choice and little robust evidence to guide selection. The 
Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial (TOPKAT) therefore aims to assess the 
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TKR versus PKR in patients with 
medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee, and this represents an analysis 
of the main endpoints at 5 years.
METHODS: Our multicentre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was done at 27 
UK sites. We used a combined expertise-based and equipoise-based approach, in 
which patients with isolated osteoarthritis of the medial compartment of the 
knee and who satisfied general requirements for a medial PKR were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to receive PKR or TKR by surgeons who were either expert in and 
willing to perform both surgeries or by a surgeon with particular expertise in 
the allocated procedure. The primary endpoint was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) 5 
years after randomisation in all patients assigned to groups. Health-care costs 
(in UK 2017 prices) and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. This trial is 
registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN03013488) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01352247).
FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2010, and Sept 30, 2013, we assessed 962 patients for 
their eligibility, of whom 431 (45%) patients were excluded (121 [13%] patients 
did not meet the inclusion criteria and 310 [32%] patients declined to 
participate) and 528 (55%) patients were randomly assigned to groups. 94% of 
participants responded to the follow-up survey 5 years after their operation. At 
the 5-year follow-up, we found no difference in OKS between groups (mean 
difference 1·04, 95% CI -0·42 to 2·50; p=0·159). In our within-trial 
cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that PKR was more effective (0·240 
additional quality-adjusted life-years, 95% CI 0·046 to 0·434) and less 
expensive (-£910, 95% CI -1503 to -317) than TKR during the 5 years of 
follow-up. This finding was a result of slightly better outcomes, lower costs of 
surgery, and lower follow-up health-care costs with PKR than TKR.
INTERPRETATION: Both TKR and PKR are effective, offer similar clinical outcomes, 
and result in a similar incidence of re-operations and complications. Based on 
our clinical findings, and results regarding the lower costs and better 
cost-effectiveness with PKR during the 5-year study period, we suggest that PKR 
should be considered the first choice for patients with late-stage isolated 
medial compartment osteoarthritis.

Cancer Pain in People With Intellectual Disabilities: Systematic Review and 
Survey of Health Care Professionals.

CONTEXT: Owing to life expectancy improvements for people with intellectual 
disabilities, their risk of developing cancer is increasing. Pain is an 
inevitable aspect of cancerous diseases. However, as pain experience and 
expression can be atypical in people with intellectual disabilities, this 
population is vulnerable to late diagnosis of cancer and undertreatment of 
cancer pain.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate what is currently 
known about cancer pain in people with intellectual disabilities and provide 
specific recommendations to improve this knowledge.
METHODS: A systematic review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL and an anonymous 
online survey of Dutch health care professionals were conducted.
RESULTS: From 10,146 publications, with intellectual disabilities in the title, 
and pain or cancer in the title or abstract, 11 articles underwent qualitative 
synthesis. Discussions within these articles were predominantly unspecific and 
brief, frequently indicating challenges in symptom presentation, communication, 
as well as assessment and treatment of cancer pain. The survey received 102 
responses. The 63 health care professionals experienced with cancer in people 
with intellectual disabilities indicated challenges recognizing, assessing, and 
treating their cancer pain.
CONCLUSION: Cancer pain in people with intellectual disabilities is a topic 
lacking specific and comprehensive research within scientific literature. We 
suggest this is due to inherent difficulties regarding the complex interplay of 
comorbidities and communication issues in people with intellectual disabilities.

OBJECTIVE: The overarching goal of the Swedish public health policy is to create 
the right societal conditions for good and equitable health throughout the 
population and to reduce avoidable health inequalities within a generation. The 
objective of this article is to highlight the main findings of the Open 
Comparisons in Public Health (OCPH) 2019 study.
STUDY DESIGN: The OCPH is a longitudinal indicator-based comparative study, 
encompassing 39 public health indicators with results from Sweden's 21 regions 
and 290 municipalities.
METHODS: Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals were used to 
compare results between municipalities, regions and time points. Correlation 
analysis was used to study the strength of the relationship between the results 
of municipalities and their socio-economic conditions.
RESULTS: Across the population, levels of health are good and have, in some 
areas, improved over recent decades. However, some significant health 
disparities remain according to neighbourhood, sex, age and educational 
background. Health disparities related to the level of education are often 
larger than those between women and men, and there are larger differences within 
a region than between regions. Health disparities have, in some cases, 
increased, such as for life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: If health equity is to be achieved, leaders at all levels must 
collaborate and advocate for political action and local efficient public health 
interventions to eliminate health disparities as a result of neighbourhood and 
social conditions.

Disentangling public preferences for health gains at end-of-life: Further 
evidence of no support of an end-of-life premium.

In many countries, it has been publicly debated whether health gains for 
patients at end-of-life (EoL) should be valued higher than health gains for 
other patients. This has led to a range of stated preference studies examining 
the justification for an EoL premium on the basis of public preferences - so far 
with mixed findings. In the present study, we seek to extend this literature. We 
apply a simple stated preference approach with illustrative binary choices to 
elicit both individual and social preferences for several types of health gains. 
More specifically, we investigate whether health gains at EoL, resulting from 
either an improvement in quality of life (QoL) or life expectancy (LE) are 
valued differently from similarly sized health gains from preventive treatment 
and treatment of a temporary disease. Furthermore, we examine whether social 
preferences are affected by the age of beneficiaries. A web-based survey was 
conducted in 2015 using a random sample of 1047 members of the general public in 
Denmark. Overall, we do not find evidence to support an EoL premium compared to 
other health gains, neither when preferences are elicited from a social nor an 
individual perspective. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the type of 
the health gain received matters to preferences for treatment at EoL with more 
weight given to gains in QoL than gains in LE. Finally, we find heterogeneity in 
preferences according to respondent characteristics, perspectives and age of 
beneficiaries.

BACKGROUND: Gains in life expectancies have stalled in Scotland, as in several 
other countries, since around 2012. The relationship between stalling mortality 
improvements and socioeconomic inequalities in health is unclear.
METHODS: We calculate the difference, as percentage change, in all-cause, 
all-age, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) between 2006 and 2011 (period 
1) and between 2012 and 2017 (period 2), for Scotland overall, by sex, and by 
Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintile. Linear regression is 
used to summarise the relationship between SIMD quintile and mortality rate 
change in each period.
RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2011, the overall ASMR fell by 10.6% (138/100 000), by 
10.1% in women, and 11.8% in men, but between 2012 and 2017 the overall ASMR 
fell by only 2.6% (30/100 000), by 3.5% in women, and by 2.0% in men. Within the 
most deprived quintile, the overall ASMR fell by 8.6% (143/100 000) from 2006 to 
2011 (7.2% in women; 9.8% in men), but rose by 1.5% (21/100 000) from 2012 to 
2017 (0.7% in women; 2.1% in men).The socioeconomic gradient in ASMR improvement 
more than quadrupled, from 0.4% per quintile in period 1, to 1.7% per quintile 
in period 2.
CONCLUSION: From 2012 to 2017, socioeconomic gradients in mortality improvement 
in Scotland were markedly steeper than over the preceding 6 years. As a result, 
there has not only been a slowdown in overall reductions in mortality, but a 
widening of socioeconomic mortality inequalities.

Expansion of disability across successive Mexican birth cohorts: a longitudinal 
modelling analysis of birth cohorts born 10 years apart.

States.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) in Mexico has risen rapidly since the 1950s. In 
high-income contexts, these increases have coincided with a compression of 
disability to later ages. However, little evidence on trends in disability-free 
LE (DFLE) exist from Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America.
METHODS: Using data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study, we compare changes 
in LE and DFLE in ages 50-59, 60-69 and 70-79 using birth-cohort-specific 
multistate lifetable models across successive 10-year birth cohorts. Disability 
was measured using the Katz activities of daily living (ADL) index, and 
limitation was measured using a seven-item questionnaire on physical 
functioning.
RESULTS: Overall, Mexican adults born in 1953-1962 lived 0.87 (p<0.001) fewer 
active years between ages 50 and 59 than individuals born in 1942-1951, a 
difference comprised of a 0.54-year (p<0.001) increase in physically limited LE 
and a 0.27-year (p<0.001) increase in ADL-disabled LE. Active LE declined by 
1.13 (p<0.001) years in ages 60-69, and by 0.93 (p<0.001) years in ages 70-79, 
across successive 10-year birth cohorts. No substantial changes in total LE were 
seen in any age group, and the magnitude of the expansion of disability was 
larger in females than in males.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that more recently born cohorts of Mexican 
adults are spending more years of life with physical limitations and 
disabilities. These results foreshadow a need to closely monitor adult health in 
middle-income contexts, as the epidemiological conditions under which disability 
has expanded in Mexico are similar to those seen in many other countries.

INTRODUCTION: Late-onset essential tremor is characterised by shorter life 
expectancy and more advanced aging parameters and may therefore be an 
'aging-related' tremor. Brainstem functions involved in pupillary responses are 
hypothesized to reflect such earlier aging. The pupillary light response (PLR) 
and a task evoked pupillary response (TEPR) were used to test this hypothesis in 
same-aged patients with early onset (EOET) and late onset (LOET) essential 
tremor and healthy controls.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Age related changes of the PLR and TEPR during the paced 
auditory serial addition test (PASAT) were tested in 57 normal subjects. 
Subsequently, 13 patients with LOET and 16 patients with EOET were compared with 
15 age matched healthy controls. Standard parameters of PLR were recorded, 
amongst others the time to maximum acceleration of the PLR (T1) and the time to 
maximum velocity (T2). The TEPR was determined during the PASAT as the 
percentage change in pupil size (PCPS). Data were analysed with ANOVA and 
post-hoc testing.
RESULTS: In normal subjects the pupil diameter, latency, maximum 
acceleration/velocity and percentage amplitude were correlated with age. Latency 
of the pupillary light response was significantly longer in LOET compared to 
controls and EOET while no differences were found between EOET and controls. The 
TEPR showed no significant differences between the three groups.
CONCLUSION: LOET showed a prolonged latency of the PLR compared to EOET possibly 
indicating premature aging or rather pathophysiological differences on brainstem 
level. This study further supports the hypothesis of abnormal aging in LOET.

Japan is experiencing unprecedented aging of its population. People age 65 years 
or older accounted for 28.1% of the total population in 2018, and that 
proportion is expected to reach 33.3% in 2036 and 38.4% in 2065. In 2017, the 
average life expectancy in Japan was 81.09 years for men and 87.26 years for 
women. By 2065, it is expected to reach 84.95 years for men and 91.35 years for 
women. Population aging affects health and long-term care systems. The 
government proposed the establishment of "a community-based integrated care 
system" by 2025 with the purpose of comprehensively ensuring the provision of 
health care, nursing care, preventive care, housing, and livelihood support. 
This will require health care and nursing care professionals who are capable of 
fully understanding the physical and mental characteristics of elderly people 
and the fostering of organic collaboration with others professionals in the 
community-based integrated care system. A department of gerontology or geriatric 
medicine is desired to be established in each medical school to teach students 
medicine and efficient medical care, to conduct research, and to develop 
personnel to facilitate this paradigm shift. In 2018, there were 263 colleges of 
nursing with an admissions capacity of 23,667. In Japan, Certified Nurse 
Specialists can specialize in 13 areas as of December 2016. The number of 
Certified Nurse Specialists increased to 2,279 as of December 2018. One hundred 
and forty-four of those specialists specialized in Gerontological Nursing while 
53 specialized in Home Care Nursing. The number of nurses specializing in 
Gerontological Nursing and Home Care Nursing is desired to be increased in order 
to implement and improve community-based comprehensive care.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing mortality and 
morbidity, in improving life expectancy and quality of life for people with 
cardiovascular disease. Despite these recognised benefits, women's attendance 
rates in cardiac rehabilitation programmes remain suboptimal.
AIMS: This paper details the study that explored factors that influence women's 
attendance of a phase two cardiac rehabilitation programme in Indonesia.
METHODS: An exploratory qualitative research design was used in the study. 
Semi-structured interviews were used as the main method of data collection. Data 
were collected from June to September 2016. Twenty-three women aged between 30 
and 66 years were interviewed. Transcribed interview data were analysed using a 
qualitative framework analysis.
RESULTS: Three major themes were inferred from the analysis: (a) a bridge to 
normal; (b) connecting with others; and (c) contextual factors. The first theme 
is illustrated by two subthemes: 'making my heart work again' and 'performing 
social roles'. The second theme was illustrated by the following subthemes: 
'exchanging knowledge and experience' and 'developing a give-and-take 
relationship'. The third theme was illustrated by three subthemes: 
'recommendations from the staff', 'family support' and 'availability of health 
insurance'.
CONCLUSION: Women's attendance in cardiac rehabilitation in Indonesia is mainly 
influenced by their expectations and desire to be able to resume their previous 
social roles in the family and society. The findings of this study can assist 
healthcare professionals to understand better the needs of women and the fit 
between women's needs and existing cardiac rehabilitation programmes. Such 
understanding could provide direction for more effective approaches to the 
cardiac rehabilitation programmes that are currently offered in Indonesia.

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of psychological 
interventions for schizophrenia/bipolar disorder (BD), to determine the 
robustness of current evidence and identify gaps in the available evidence.
METHODS: Electronic searches (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase) identified economic 
evaluations relating incremental cost to outcomes in the form of an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio published in English since 2000. Searches were 
concluded in November 2018. Inclusion criteria were: adults with 
schizophrenia/BD; any psychological/psychosocial intervention (e.g., 
psychological therapy and integrated/collaborative care); probability of 
cost-effectiveness at explicitly defined thresholds reported. Comparators could 
be routine practice, no intervention, or alternative psychological therapies. 
Screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal were performed using 
pre-specified criteria and forms. Results were summarized qualitatively. The 
protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42017056579).
RESULTS: Of 3,864 studies identified, 12 met the criteria for data extraction. 
All were integrated clinical and economic randomized controlled trials. The most 
common intervention was cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, 6/12 studies). The 
most common measure of health benefit was the quality-adjusted life-year (6/12). 
Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 5 years. Interventions were found to be 
cost-effective in most studies (9/12): the probability of cost-effectiveness 
ranged from 35-99.5 percent. All studies had limitations and demonstrated 
uncertainty (particularly related to incremental costs).
CONCLUSIONS: Most studies concluded psychological interventions for 
schizophrenia/BD are cost-effective, including CBT, although there was notable 
uncertainty. Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to reach strong 
conclusions. There is a particular need for more evidence in the population with 
BD and for longer-term evidence across both populations.

OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of antihypertensive medication treatment in 
hypertensive nursing home (NH) residents with and without dementia and determine 
the association between antihypertensive treatment and outcomes important to 
individuals with dementia.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: All US NHs.
PARTICIPANTS: Long-term NH residents treated for hypertension in the second 
quarter of 2013, with and without moderate or severe cognitive impairment, as 
defined by the NH Minimum Data Set (MDS) Cognitive Function Scale.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary exposure was intensity of antihypertensive treatment, 
as defined as number of first-line antihypertensive medications in Medicare Part 
D dispensing data. The outcome measures were hospitalization, hospitalization 
for cardiovascular diseases using Medicare Hierarchical Condition Categories, 
decline in physical function using the MDS Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) 
scale, and death during a 180-day follow-up period.
RESULTS: Of 255 670 NH residents treated for hypertension, 117 732 (46.0%) had 
moderate or severe cognitive impairment. At baseline, 54.4%, 34.3%, and 11.4% 
received one, two, and three or more antihypertensive medications, respectively. 
Moderate or severe cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80 vs no or mild 
impairment; P < .0001), worse physical function (OR = 0.64 worst vs best 
tertile; P < .0001), and hospice or less than a 6-month life expectancy (OR = 
0.80; P < .0001) were associated with receipt of fewer antihypertensive 
medications. Increased intensity of antihypertensive treatment was associated 
with small increases in hospitalization (difference per additional medication = 
0.24%; 95% confidence interval = 0.03%-0.45%) and cardiovascular hospitalization 
(difference per additional medication = 0.30%; 95% confidence interval = 
0.21%-0.39%) and a small decrease in ADL decline (difference per additional 
medication = -0.46%; 95% confidence interval = -0.67% to -0.25%). There was no 
significant difference in mortality (difference per additional medication = 
-0.05%; 95% confidence interval = -0.23% to 0.13%).
CONCLUSION: Long-term NH residents with hypertension do not experience 
significant benefits from more intensive antihypertensive treatment. 
Antihypertensive medications are reasonable targets for deintensification in 
residents in whom this is consistent with goals of care. J Am Geriatr Soc 
67:2058-2064, 2019.

To understand how ambient temperature affect the gypsy moth larvae, and provide 
a theoretical basis for pest control in different environments. Fourth instar 
gypsy moth larvae were incubating for 3 hr at 15℃, 20℃, 25℃, 30℃, 35℃, and 40℃, 
respectively. Afterward, digestive and antioxidant enzyme activities, total 
antioxidant capacity, and intestinal microflora community were analyzed to 
reveal how the caterpillars respond to ambient temperature stress. Results 
showed that both digestive and antioxidant enzymes were regulated by the ambient 
temperature. The optimum incubation temperatures of protease, amylase, 
trehalase, and lipase in gypsy moth larvae were 30℃, 25℃, and 20℃, respectively. 
When the incubation temperature was deviated optimum temperatures, digestive 
enzyme activities would be downregulated depending on the extent of temperature 
stress. In addition, glutathione S-transferase, peroxidase, catalase, and 
polyphenol oxidase would be activated under a sufferable temperature stress, but 
superoxide dismutase and carboxylesterase (CarE) would be inhibited. In 
addition, results showed that the top two abundant phyla were Proteobacteria and 
Firmicutes. The phylum Firmicutes abundance was decreased and phylum 
Proteobacteria abundance was increased by ambient temperature stress. Moreover, 
it suggested that gypsy moth caterpillars at different ambient temperature 
mainly differed from each other by Escherichia-Shigella and Bifidobacterium in 
control, Acinetobacter in T15, and Lactobacillus in T40, respectively.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the incidence of a person's first diagnosis of a 
selected chronic disease, and the relationships between modifiable lifestyle 
risk factors and age to first of six chronic diseases.
METHODS: Ontario respondents from 2001 to 2010 of the Canadian Community Health 
Survey were followed up with administrative data until 2014 for congestive heart 
failure, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, diabetes, lung cancer, 
myocardial infarction and stroke. By sex, the cumulative incidence function of 
age to first chronic disease was calculated for the six chronic diseases 
individually and compositely. The associations between modifiable lifestyle risk 
factors (alcohol, body mass index, smoking, diet, physical inactivity) and age 
to first chronic disease were estimated using cause-specific Cox proportional 
hazards models and Fine-Gray competing risk models.
RESULTS: Diabetes was the most common disease. By age 70.5 years (2015 world 
life expectancy), 50.9% of females and 58.1% of males had at least one disease 
and few had a death free of the selected diseases (3.4% females; 5.4% males). Of 
the lifestyle factors, heavy smoking had the strongest association with the risk 
of experiencing at least one chronic disease (cause-specific hazard 
ratio = 3.86; 95% confidence interval = 3.46, 4.31). The lifestyle factors were 
modelled for each disease separately, and the associations varied by chronic 
disease and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that most individuals will have at least one of the six 
chronic diseases before dying. This study provides a novel approach using 
competing risk methods to examine the incidence of chronic diseases relative to 
the life course and how their incidences are associated with lifestyle 
behaviours.

BACKGROUND: Despite the well-known negative prognostic value of the V600EBRAF 
mutation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), its outcome is 
quite heterogeneous, and the basis for this prognostic heterogeneity should be 
better defined.
METHODS: Two large retrospective series of V600EBRAF-mutated mCRC from 22 
institutions served as an exploratory and validation set to develop a prognostic 
score. The model was internally and externally validated.
RESULTS: A total of 395 V600EBRAF-mutated mCRCs were included in the exploratory 
set. Performance status, CA19.9, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil/lymphocyte 
ratio, grading and liver, lung and nodal involvement emerged as independent 
prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Two different scoring systems were 
built: a 'complete' score (0-16) including all significant covariates and a 
'simplified' score (0-9), based only on clinicopathological covariates, and 
excluding laboratory values. Adopting the complete score, proportions of 
patients with a low (0-4), intermediate (5-8) and high (9-16) score were 44.7%, 
42.6% and 12.6%, respectively. The median OS was 29.6, 15.5 (hazard ratio [HR] 
for intermediate vs low risk: 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44-3.22, 
p < .001) and 6.6 months (HR for high vs low risk: 4.72, 95% CI: 2.72-8.20, 
p < .001). Similar results were observed also after adjusting for the type of 
first-line treatment and adopting the simplified score. The simplified 
prognostic score derived from the exploratory set was then applied to the 
validation set for external confirmation.
CONCLUSIONS: These scoring systems are based on easy-to-collect data and defined 
specific subgroups with relevant differences in their life expectancy. These 
tools could be useful in clinical practice, would allow better stratification of 
patients in clinical trials and may be adopted for proper adjustments in 
exploratory translational analyses.

This study aimed to estimate and compare life expectancy at birth among people 
with and without officially registered disabilities in Korea between 2004 and 
2017. We used the National Health Information Database in Korea to obtain 
aggregate data on the numbers of population and deaths according to calendar 
year (2004 to 2017), sex, age groups, and officially registered disability 
status. A total of 697,503,634 subjects and 3,536,778 deaths, including 
33,221,916 disabled subjects (829,464 associated deaths), were used to construct 
life tables. Between 2004 and 2017, life expectancy for people with disabilities 
increased by 9.1 years in men and 8.3 years in women, while life expectancy for 
the non-disabled increased by 5.5 years in men and 4.6 years in women. The 
average life expectancy difference between non-disabled and disabled people was 
18.2 years during the study period, decreasing from 20.4 years in 2004 to 16.4 
years in 2017. In 2017, the life expectancy of people with the most severe grade 
of disabilities was 49.7 years, while the life expectancy of people with the 
least severe grade of disabilities was 77.7 years. The government should 
implement more effective policies to protect the health of people with 
officially registered disabilities.

Bevacizumab treatment in metastatic colorectal carcinoma - an economic 
perspective.

[Article in English]

Sehnalová I, Říhová B, Demlová R.

Targeted therapy is a significant benefit in the treatment of cancer patients. 
Bevacizumab improves overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) 
in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The clinical 
effectiveness of bevacizumab is similar to its efficacy in randomised controlled 
trials. However, the costs of bevacizumab treatment as well as other agents of 
targeted treatment are discussed between the health care payers, the regulatory 
authorities and the members of professional societies. Biomarkers of bevacizumab 
treatment helpful in the selection of eligible groups of patients are still 
missing. This review focuses on current bevacizumab therapy of mCRC from the 
pharmacoeconomic perspective. The cost per a 14-day bevacizumab treatment cycle 
is approximately 31,000 CZK in the Czech Republic. External published 
pharmacoeconomics analyses have no clear conclusions. Their results are usually 
expressed as the cost per QALY gained in comparison with a comparator. They 
differ according to the economic situation of the particular countries. The 
pharmacoeconomic results have to be confirmed in the real clinical practice, and 
then the decision should be reassessed by using the uniform methodology, e.g. 
the Health Technology Assessment (HTA).

The burden of neurologic disease in the United States continues to increase due 
to a growing older population, increased life expectancy, and improved mortality 
after cancer and cardiac disease. Emergency medical services (EMS) providers are 
responding to more patients with stroke, traumatic neurologic injury, 
neuromuscular weakness, seizure, and spontaneous cardiac arrest. Efficient 
prehospital care and triage to facilities with specialized services improve 
outcomes. Effective handoff from EMS to an emergency department ensures 
continuity of care and patient safety. Although advancements in prehospital 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation have increased rates of return to spontaneous 
circulation, a large proportion of patients sustain neurologic injury.
