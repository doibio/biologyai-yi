BACKGROUND: There is a shortage of information on the costs and benefits of 
anti-bullying programs implemented in Australia. Information on the costs and 
benefits of anti-bullying programs is vital to assist policy making regarding 
the adoption of these programs. The aim of this study was to estimate the 
changes to costs and health benefits of implementing the "Friendly Schools 
Friendly Families" (FSFF) anti-bullying intervention in Australia.
METHODS: A societal perspective cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken based 
on randomised controlled trial data for an anti-bullying intervention 
implemented in primary schools in Western Australia. The modelling strategy 
addressed changes to costs comprising intervention costs, less cost-savings, and 
then changes to health benefits measured by avoidable disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs). Costs and health benefits were identified, measured, and valued 
in 2016 Australian dollars. Intermediate events modelled included anxiety 
disorders, depressive disorders, intentional self-harm, cost-savings accrued by 
educator time, and reduced productivity losses for carers associated with 
absenteeism. Uncertainty analysis and scenario analyses were also conducted.
RESULTS: The prevalence of bullying victimisation was reduced by 18% by the 
Friendly Schools Friendly Families anti-bullying intervention. At a national 
level, this is expected to result in the avoidance of 9114 DALYs (95% CI 
8770-9459) and cost-savings of A$120 million per year. The majority of 
cost-savings were associated with the reduction in mental healthcare. The model 
results demonstrated that the FSFF anti-bullying intervention is likely to be a 
cost-effective approach to reduce bullying in Australia, relative to a threshold 
of A$50,000 per DALY averted, with an ICER of A$1646.
CONCLUSIONS: The Friendly Schools Friendly Families anti-bullying intervention 
represents a good investment compared to usual activities for the management of 
child and adolescent bullying in Australia. The investment and implementation of 
evidence-based interventions that reduce bullying victimisation and bullying 
perpetration in schools could reduce the economic burden associated with common 
mental health disorders and thereby improve the health of many Australians.

BACKGROUND: More than 90% of the global population lives in areas exceeding 
World Health Organization air quality limits. More than four million people each 
year are thought to die early due to air pollution, and poor air quality is 
thought to reduce an average European's life expectancy by one year. Individuals 
may be able to reduce health risks through interventions such as masks, 
behavioural changes and use of air quality alerts. To date, evidence is lacking 
about the efficacy and safety of such interventions for the general population 
and people with long-term respiratory conditions. This topic, and the review 
question relating to supporting evidence to avoid or lessen the effects of air 
pollution, emerged directly from a group of people with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) in South London, UK.
OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of 
individual-level interventions that aim to help people with or without chronic 
respiratory conditions to reduce their exposure to outdoor air pollution. 2. To 
assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of individual-level interventions 
that aim to help people with chronic respiratory conditions reduce the personal 
impact of outdoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.
SEARCH METHODS: We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and other major databases. We 
did not restrict our searches by date, language or publication type and included 
a search of the grey literature (e.g. unpublished information). We conducted the 
most recent search on 16 October 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
non-randomised studies (NRS) that included a comparison treatment arm, in adults 
and children that investigated the effectiveness of an individual-level 
intervention to reduce risks of outdoor air pollution. We included studies in 
healthy individuals and those in people with long-term respiratory conditions. 
We excluded studies which focused on non-respiratory long-term conditions, such 
as cardiovascular disease. We did not restrict eligibility of studies based on 
outcomes.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Two review 
authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted study 
characteristics and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 
Risk of Bias tool for RCTs and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of 
Interventions (ROBINS-I) as appropriate. One review author entered data into the 
review; this was spot-checked by a second author. We planned to meta-analyse 
results from RCTs and NRS separately, using a random-effects model. This was not 
possible, so we presented evidence narratively. We assessed certainty of the 
evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were: measures of air 
pollution exposure; exacerbation of respiratory conditions; hospital admissions; 
quality of life; and serious adverse events.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 11 studies (3372 participants) meeting our inclusion 
criteria (10 RCTs and one NRS). Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years, 
and the duration of studies ranged from 24 hours to 104 weeks. Six cross-over 
studies recruited healthy adults and five parallel studies included either 
people with pre-existing conditions (three studies) or only pregnant women (two 
studies). Interventions included masks (e.g. an N95 mask designed to filter out 
airborne particles) (five studies), an alternative cycle route (one study), air 
quality alerts and education (five studies). Studies were set in Australia, 
China, Iran, the UK, and the USA. Due to the diversity of study designs, 
populations, interventions and outcomes, we did not perform any meta-analyses 
and instead summarised results narratively. We judged both RCTs and the NRS to 
be at risk of bias from lack of blinding and lack of clarity regarding selection 
methods. Many studies did not provide a prepublished protocol or trial 
registration. From five studies (184 participants), we found that masks or 
altered cycle routes may have little or no impact on physiological markers of 
air pollution exposure (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate variability), but we 
are very uncertain about this estimate using the GRADE approach. We found 
conflicting evidence regarding health care usage from three studies of air 
pollution alerts, with one non-randomised cross-over trial (35 participants) 
reporting an increase in emergency hospital attendances and admissions, but the 
other two randomised parallel trials (1553 participants) reporting little to no 
difference. We also gave the evidence for this outcome a very uncertain GRADE 
rating. None of our included trials reported respiratory exacerbations, quality 
of life or serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were not well reported, 
but indicated inconsistent impacts of air quality alerts and education 
interventions on adherence, with some trials reporting improvements in the 
intervention groups and others reporting little or no difference. Symptoms were 
reported by three trials, with one randomised cross-over trial (15 participants) 
reporting a small increase in breathing difficulties associated with the mask 
intervention, one non-randomised cross-over trial (35 participants) reporting 
reduced throat and nasal irritation in the lower-pollution cycle route group 
(but no clear difference in other respiratory symptoms), and another randomised 
parallel trial (519 participants) reporting no clear difference in symptoms 
between those who received a smog warning and those who did not.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The lack of evidence and study diversity has limited the 
conclusions of this review. Using a mask or a lower-pollution cycle route may 
mitigate some of the physiological impacts from air pollution, but evidence was 
very uncertain. We found conflicting results for other outcomes, including 
health care usage, symptoms and adherence/behaviour change. We did not find 
evidence for adverse events. Funders should consider commissioning larger, 
longer studies, using high-quality and well-described methods, recruiting 
participants with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Studies should report 
outcomes of importance to people with respiratory conditions, such as 
exacerbations, hospital admissions, quality of life and adverse events.

Aneurysmal bone cyst is a benign bone neoplasm that most commonly arises from 
the metaphyses of long bones in the first and second decades of life. Here, we 
describe a case of an aneurysmal bone cyst that occurred in the distal tibial 
diaphysis of a 72-year-old female that was concerning for malignancy on imaging, 
demonstrating cortical breakthrough and soft tissue extension. Histologically, 
the tumor showed the characteristic morphologic features of aneurysmal bone 
cyst. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was positive for USP6 rearrangement, 
and RNA sequencing revealed a USP6 gene fusion with VDR, a novel partner that 
encodes the vitamin D receptor and that has not been implicated previously in 
human neoplasia. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges presented by 
aneurysmal bone cyst in elderly adults, and it expands the genetic spectrum of 
USP6 rearrangements.

Italy is a country of 60 million citizens with a high life expectancy, an 
increasing prevalence of chronic multi-morbidity and a public healthcare system. 
There are 61 medical schools and more than one thousand postgraduate programs 
for 50 different specialisations. In this article, we describe the Italian 
medical educational system and its most recent evolution towards a process of 
internationalization, alongside pedagogical and cultural changes. The main 
challenges are in the process of students' selection, which is still only based 
on the assessment of basic knowledge, and in the reform of the post-graduate 
education, which lacks an official, formal definition of the learning outcomes 
and the aligned methods of assessment. The opportunities come from the 
increasing awareness of the importance of faculty development programs. The 
pandemic itself acted as a catalyst of innovation, pushing toward more 
student-centered teaching-learning activities. Finally, an increase in 
international collaborations in medical education research could be effective to 
foster the development of medical education in the country.

Physiological ageing and tumorigenesis are both associated with epigenomic 
alterations in human tissue cells, the most extensively investigated of which 
entails de novo cytosine methylation (i.e., hypermethylation) within the CpG 
dinucleotides of CpG islands. Genomic regions that become hypermethylated during 
tumorigenesis are generally believed to overlap regions that acquire methylation 
in normal tissues as an effect of ageing. To define the extension of this 
overlap, we analysed the DNA methylomes of 48 large-bowel tissue samples taken 
from women of different ages during screening colonoscopy: 18 paired samples of 
normal and lesional tissues from donors harbouring a precancerous lesion and 12 
samples of normal mucosa from tumour-free donors. Each sample was subjected to 
targeted, genome-wide bisulphite sequencing of ~2.5% of the genome, including 
all CpG islands. In terms of both its magnitude and extension along the 
chromatin, tumour-associated DNA hypermethylation in these regions was much more 
conspicuous than that observed in the normal mucosal samples from older (vs. 
younger) tumour-free donors. 83% of the ageing-associated hypermethylated 
regions (n = 2501) coincided with hypermethylated regions observed in tumour 
samples. However, 86% of the regions displaying hypermethylation in precancerous 
lesions (n = 16,772) showed no methylation changes in the ageing normal mucosa. 
The tumour-specificity of this latter hypermethylation was validated using 
published sets of data on DNA methylation in normal and neoplastic colon 
tissues. This extensive set of genomic regions displaying tumour-specific 
hypermethylation represents a rich vein of putative biomarkers for the early, 
non-invasive detection of colorectal tumours in women of all ages.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory chronic autoimmune disease. The 
treatment of RA is difficult and, in many cases, ineffective, and the arsenal of 
drugs is limited. Due the longevity of the disease, RA may cause extreme 
musculoskeletal disorders with a high impact on quality of life. Also, RA is 
related with severe comorbidities decreasing the life expectancy. Finally, RA 
has been reported to impact in economy and healthy public. In this direction, 
the necessity to discover new strategies to efficiently treat RA is immediate. 
In this direction, we have reported the use of low doses of [223Ra] RaCl2 
(radium dichloride) as intra-articular injection to treat RA. Mice were 
post-treated with [223Ra] RaCl2 (1.48 µCi; i.a.) 24 h after zymosan 
stimulus. Zymosan-induced arthrithis is responsible for leucocyte recruitment 
(total leukocytes, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells), which were inhibited by 
intra-articular injection of [223Ra] RaCl2 (69%, 77%, and 66%, respectively).

This article presents a theory in which motor execution in perceptual 
decision-making tasks is determined by the same evolving decision variable that 
drives response time. The theory builds upon recent insights from the 
neuroscience of decision-making and motor control. It is formalized as an 
extension of Ratcliff's diffusion model, and assumes that two thresholds operate 
on the evidence accumulation decision variable. The first threshold, referred to 
as electromyographic (EMG) threshold, marks the onset of electrical activity in 
the response-relevant muscle and the beginning of force production. The second 
threshold corresponds to the response. The theory makes several benchmark 
predictions. Notably, the mean duration of motor execution, as quantified by the 
mean latency between EMG onset and the response, should depend on the rate of 
evidence accumulation, and should thus increase as the perceptual difficulty of 
the task increases. We tested these predictions in a paradigmatic perceptual 
decision-making task, the random dot motion task, and recorded the EMG activity 
of response-relevant muscles. The behavioral and EMG data provide very strong 
evidence for each prediction. A final quantitative evaluation of the model 
showed good fits to these data. The theory resolves conflicting findings in the 
fields of mathematical psychology, motor control, and decision neurosciences.

INTRODUCTION: Of 2.5 million newborn deaths each year, serious neonatal 
infections are a leading cause of neonatal death for which inpatient treatment 
is recommended. However, manysick newborns in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia 
do not have access to inpatientcare. A World Health Organization (WHO) guideline 
recommends simplified antibiotic treatment atan outpatient level for young 
infants up to two months of age with possible serious bacterial infection 
(PSBI), when referral is not feasible.We implemented this guidelinein Ethiopia 
to increase coverage of treatment and to learn about potential facilitating 
factors and barriers for implementation.
METHODS: We conducted implementation research in two districts (Tiro Afata and 
Gera) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, to learn about the feasibility of implementing 
the WHO PSBI guideline within a programme setting using the existing health care 
structure. We conducted orientation meetings and policy dialogue with key 
stakeholders and trained health extension workers and health centre staff to 
identify and manage sick young infants with PSBI signs at a primary health care 
unit. We established a Technical Support Unit (TSU) to facilitate programme 
learning, built health workers' capacity and provided support for quality 
control, monitoring and data collection.We sensitized the community to 
appropriate care-seeking and supported the health care system in implementation. 
The research team collected data using structured case recording forms.
RESULTS: From September 2016 to August 2017, 6185 live births and 601 sick young 
infants 0-59 days of age with signs of PSBI were identified. Assuming that 25% 
of births were missed (total births 7731) and 10% of births had an episode of 
PSBI in the first two months of life, the coverage of appropriate treatment for 
PSBI was 77.7% (601/773). Of 601 infants with PSBI, fast breathing only 
(pneumonia) was recorded in 432 (71.9%) infants 7-59 days of age; signs of 
clinical severe infection (CSI) in 155 (25.8%) and critical illnessin 14 (2.3%). 
Of the 432 pneumonia cases who received oral amoxicillin treatment without 
referral, 419 (97.0%) were successfully treated without any deaths. Of 169 sick 
young infants with either CSI or critical illness, only 110 were referred to a 
hospital; 83 did not accept referral advice and received outpatient injectable 
gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin treatment either at a health post or health 
centre. Additionally, 59 infants who should have been referred, but were not 
received injectable gentamicin plus oral amoxicillin outpatient treatment. Of 
infants with CSI, 129 (82.2%) were successfully treated as outpatients, while 
two died (1.3%). Of 14 infants with critical illness, the caregivers of five 
accepted referral to a hospital, and nine were treated with simplified 
antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Two of 14 (14.3%) infants with critical 
illness died within 14 days of initial presentation.
CONCLUSION: In settings where referral to a hospital is not feasible, young 
infants with PSBI can be treated on an outpatient basis at either a health post 
or health centre, which can contribute to saving many lives. Scaling-up will 
require health system strengthening including community mobilization.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) remains shorter 
than that of the general population, despite significant improvement in the 
recent years. Mortality in HIV-infected individuals may be associated with a 
higher viral load at of diagnosis, a lower CD4 count, or clinical variables such 
as sex or route of transmission. This article investigated the role of the 
HLA-B*5701 varian on mortality among PLWH.
METHODS: Material for the analysis consist of the data of 2,393 patients for 
whom the HLA-B*57 variant was known. Those patients were followed under the care 
of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Warsaw (n = 1555) and the Clinic of 
Acquired Immunodeficiency of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin (n = 
838). Factors such as age, gender, date of HIV diagnosis, route of transmission, 
date of death, baseline HIV viral load and baseline CD4 counts, were collected, 
and end-point cross-sectional analyses were marked at 60, 120, 180 and 240 month 
of observation.
RESULTS: HLA-B*5701 allele was found in 133 (5.5%) analyzed cases. Median age 
was notably higher for HLA-B*5701 positive patients [32.7 (28.3-41.3) vs. 31.6 
(26.8-38.3)years p = 0.02]. HLA-B*5701 was associated with lower baseline viral 
load [4.21 (3.5-4.8) vs. 4.79 (4.2-5.3)log copies/ml p<0.001] and higher 
CD4count [448 (294.5-662) vs. 352 (176-514) cells/μl p<0.001]. There were no 
association between HLA-B*5701 and survival for any given end-point. Higher 
mortality was associated to male gender, intravenous drug users, lower CD4 count 
at baseline and higher baseline viral load.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the presence of HLA-B*5701 allel was not associated 
with mortality rate of HIV infected patients, irrespective of being associated 
with both higher baseline CD4 + cell count and lower baseline HIV viral load.

BACKGROUND: In the USA, Black and Hispanic or Latinx individuals continue to be 
disproportionately affected by HIV. Applying a distributional cost-effectiveness 
framework, we estimated the cost-effectiveness and epidemiological impact of two 
combination implementation approaches to identify the approach that best meets 
the dual objectives of improving population health and reducing racial or ethnic 
health disparities.
METHODS: We adapted a dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model to 
characterise HIV micro-epidemics in six US cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Los 
Angeles, Miami, New York, and Seattle. We considered combinations of 16 
evidence-based interventions to diagnose, treat, and prevent HIV transmission 
according to previously documented levels of scale-up. We then identified 
optimal combination strategies for each city, with the distribution of each 
intervention implemented according to existing service levels (proportional 
services approach) and the racial or ethnic distribution of new diagnoses 
(between Black, Hispanic or Latinx, and White or other ethnicity individuals; 
equity approach). We estimated total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of strategies implemented from 2020 to 
2030 (health-care perspective; 20-year time horizon; 3% annual discount rate). 
We estimated three measures of health inequality (between-group variance, index 
of disparity, Theil index), incidence rate ratios, and rate differences for the 
selected strategies under each approach.
FINDINGS: In all cities, optimal combination strategies under the equity 
approach generated more QALYs than those with proportional services, ranging 
from a 3·1% increase (95% credible interval [CrI] 1·4-5·3) in New York to more 
than double (101·9% [75·4-134·6]) in Atlanta. Compared with proportional 
services, the equity approach delivered lower costs over 20 years in all cities 
except Los Angeles; cost reductions ranged from $22·9 million (95% CrI 5·3-55·7 
million) in Seattle to $579·8 million (255·4-940·5 million) in Atlanta. The 
equity approach also reduced incidence disparities and health inequality 
measures in all cities except Los Angeles.
INTERPRETATION: Equity-focused HIV combination implementation strategies that 
reduce disparities for Black and Hispanic or Latinx individuals can 
significantly improve population health, reduce costs, and drive progress 
towards Ending the HIV Epidemic goals in the USA.

The present research was conducted to provide insight into digestive larval 
capacity in Acanthopagrus latus larvae from hatching up to 30 days after 
hatching (DAH). Newly hatched larvae were stocked into six 300-L cylindrical 
polyethylene tanks at a density of larvae 50 larvae/L and reared by means of the 
green water system using Nannochloropsis oculata (0.5 × 106/mL). After mouth 
opening, larvae were fed with rotifers (5-16 individual/mL) from 2 to 20 DAH; 
then, Artemia nauplii (0.5-3.0 individuals/mL) were offered to larvae from 18 to 
30 DAH, meanwhile a commercial microdiet was offered to larvae from 25 to 30 
DAH. Larval performance in terms of growth and survival, and the assessment of 
the activity of selected digestive enzymes ontogeny of digestive enzymes 
activities was evaluated in larvae sampled at 0 (hatching), 7, 15, 22 and 30 
DAH. Larvae showed an exponential growth characterized by two different growth 
stanzas, a first one characterized by slow growth rates comprised between 
hatching to 15 DAH (4.7 ± 0.2 mm), followed by a period of faster growth rates 
between 16 and 30 DAH (7.5 ± 0.6 mm). The activities of the brush border 
(alkaline phosphatase, ALP) and cytosolic (leucine-alanine peptidase, LAP) 
enzymes, as well as those of the pancreatic ones like total alkaline proteases, 
bile salt-activated lipase and α-amylase were detected from the mouth opening 
stage. Total activities of pancreatic and gastric enzymes increased with larval 
growth showing an enhancement of digestive capacities with larval age and size. 
The intestinal maturation in A. latus as assessed by the ratio of AP to LAP did 
not occur as expected by end of the first month of life suggesting the complete 
establishment of digestive luminal processes may take place at older ages. This 
study related to the growth patterns and ontogenic changes in activity of 
pancreatic, gastric and intestinal enzymes in A. latus and their nutritional 
regulation may be considered as the first step for improving the larviculture, 
as well as assessing and refining the nutritional requirements during the larval 
and early juvenile stages of this sparid species.

BACKGROUND: Delayed diagnosis and noneffective treatment contribute to the 
shorter life expectancy in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). 
Studies demonstrate the key role of autoimmunity in PMS, but the prognostic 
value of immune-associated factors remains unknown. Thus, this study aimed to 
develop an immune-associated gene (IAG) signature related to overall survival 
(OS) and conduct an immune cell infiltration analysis using PMS data.
METHODS: The differentially expressed IAGs were identified based on gene 
expression profiles (from the Gene Expression Omnibus database) and IAGs (from 
the ImmPort database). Univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox regression analyses were used to develop the IAG 
signature related to OS. Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted, and receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the performance. 
Additionally, the differential distribution of immune cells was identified by 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and correlations with IAGs were analyzed using Spearman 
correlation analyses. Moreover, univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses were used to identify the independent prognostic factors to develop a 
prognostic nomogram.
RESULTS: The training group, consisting of 57 PMS lesions and 52 control 
tissues, was obtained through batch normalization to remove the inter-batch 
difference. A total of 206 differentially expressed IAGs were identified, and 38 
of them were associated with OS. Thereafter, a 4-IAG signature was constructed 
to calculate the risk score and thus classify PMS patients into high- and 
low-risk groups according to mean risk score. Patients in the high-risk group 
had a lower survival time than those in the low-risk group. The Kaplan-Meier 
plots and ROC curves demonstrated a good performance in both the training and 
internal validation groups. Additionally, five differentially abundant immune 
cell types were identified and their relationships with IAGs were analyzed. 
Finally, risk score, cortical region, and naive B cells were identified as 
independent prognostic factors, and a nomogram incorporating these factors was 
developed to predict the OS in PMS.
CONCLUSION: The novel IAG signature may be a reliable tool for assisting 
neurologists in predicting the OS for PMS patients in clinical settings. These 
findings may facilitate personalized treatment and provide insights into the 
complex mechanism of PMS.

To map the magnitudes and temporal trends of blindness and vision loss (BVL) due 
to common eye diseases along with its attributable risk factors at the national, 
regional, and global levels. The annual burden of BVL in 204 countries and 
territories was extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and causes composition change were 
calculated to quantify the temporal trends of BVL-related disease burden by sex, 
region, and eye disease. The global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 
BVL increased from 12.44 million in 1990 to 22.56 million in 2019, with a 
slightly decreased rate from 3.03 to 2.78 per 1000 population (EAPC = -0.30). 
About 29.6% of BVL-related DALYs worldwide were caused by cataract, followed by 
refraction disorders (29.1%), near vision loss (21.7%), other vision loss 
(13.7%), glaucoma (3.3%), and age-related macular degeneration (2.5%) in 2019. 
The age-standardized DALYs rates due to each eye disease type in most regions 
were decreased, especially in countries with high burden and high-middle 
socio-demographic index. Moreover, the contribution of smoking and air pollution 
from solid fuels to BVL burden decreased, however, the age-standardized burden 
of BVL attributed to high body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose 
elevated gradually across almost all regions. The temporal trend of BVL burden 
due to specific eye diseases varies remarkably by region, sex and age. 
Understanding the real-time patterns of BVL burden is crucial for formulating 
more effective and targeted prevention and healthcare strategies to decrease the 
BVL burden.

Harvest for Health is a home-based vegetable gardening intervention that pairs 
cancer survivors with Master Gardeners from the Cooperative Extension System. 
Initially developed and tested in Alabama, the program was adapted for the 
different climate, growing conditions, and population in New Mexico. This paper 
chronicles the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of 
"Southwest Harvest for Health". During the nine-month single-arm trial, 30 
cancer survivor-Master Gardener dyads worked together to establish and maintain 
three seasonal gardens. Primary outcomes were accrual, retention, and 
satisfaction. Secondary outcomes were vegetable and fruit (V and F) intake, 
physical activity, and quality of life. Recruitment was diverse and robust, with 
30 survivors of various cancers, aged 50-83, roughly one-third minority, and 
two-thirds females enrolled in just 60 days. Despite challenges due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, retention to the nine-month study was 100%, 93% reported 
"good-to-excellent" satisfaction, and 87% "would do it again." A median increase 
of 1.2 servings of V and F/day was documented. The adapted home-based vegetable 
gardening program was feasible, well-received, and resulted in increased V and F 
consumption among adult cancer survivors. Future studies are needed to evaluate 
the effectiveness of this program and to inform strategies to increase the 
successful implementation and further dissemination of this intervention.

OBJECTIVES: For men with intermediate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 
(4-10 ng/mL), urine-based biomarkers and multiparametric magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) are increasingly used as reflex tests before prostate biopsy. We 
assessed the cost effectiveness of these reflex tests in the United States.
METHODS: We used an existing microsimulation model of prostate cancer (PCa) 
progression and survival to predict lifetime outcomes for a hypothetical cohort 
of 55-year-old men with intermediate PSA levels. Urine-based biomarkers-PCa 
antigen (PCA3), TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion (T2:ERG), and the MyProstateScore (MPS) 
for any PCa and for high-grade (Gleason score ≥7) PCa (MPShg)-were generated 
using biomarker data from 1112 men presenting for biopsy at 10 United States 
institutions. MRI results were based on published sensitivity and specificity 
for high-grade PCa. Costs and utilities were sourced from literature and 
Medicare reimbursement schedules. Outcome measures included life years, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime medical costs per patient. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were empirically calculated on the basis 
of simulated life histories under different reflex testing strategies.
RESULTS: Biopsying all men provided the most life years and QALYs, followed by 
reflex testing using MPShg, MPS, MRI, T2:ERG, PCA3, and biopsying no men (QALY 
range across strategies 15.98-16.09). Accounting for costs, MRI and MPShg were 
dominated by other strategies. PCA3, T2:ERG, and MPS were likely to be the most 
cost-effective strategy at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $100 000/QALY, 
$125 000/QALY, and $150 000/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using PCA3, T2:ERG, or MPS as reflex tests has greater economic 
value than MRI, biopsying all men, or biopsying no men with intermediate PSA 
levels.

OBJECTIVES: Decision-making frameworks that draw on economic evaluations 
increasingly use equity weights to facilitate a more equitable and fair 
allocation of healthcare resources. These weights can be attached to health 
gains or reflected in the monetary threshold against which the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of (new) health technologies are evaluated. Currently 
applied weights are based on different definitions of disease severity and do 
not account for age-related preferences in society. However, age has been shown 
to be an important equity-relevant characteristic. This study examines the 
willingness to pay (WTP) for health-related quality of life (QOL) gains in 
relation to the disease severity and age of patients, and the outcome of the 
disease.
METHODS: We obtained WTP estimates by applying contingent-valuation tasks in a 
representative sample of the public in The Netherlands (n = 2023). We applied 
random-effects generalized least squares regression models to estimate the 
effect of patients' disease severity and age, size of QOL gains, disease outcome 
(full recovery/death 1 year after falling ill), and respondent characteristics 
on the WTP.
RESULTS: Respondents' WTP was higher for more severely ill and younger patients 
and for larger-sized QOL gains, but lower for patients who died. However, the 
relations were nonlinear and context dependent. Respondents with a lower age, 
who were male, had a higher household income, and a higher QOL stated a higher 
WTP for QOL gains.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that-if the aim is to align resource-allocation 
decisions in healthcare with societal preferences-currently applied equity 
weights do not suffice.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to establish the Japanese population norms of the 
EQ-5D-5L and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) and estimate the disutility 
associated with diseases and symptoms.
METHODS: We performed a door-to-door survey of the general population by random 
sampling. The planned sample size was 10 000 residents (age ≥16 years) of 334 
districts in Japan. In addition to the EQ-5D-5L and HUI3 questionnaires, 
questions regarding demographic factors and self-reported main diseases and 
symptoms were asked. The EQ-5D-5L and HUI3 responses were converted to index 
values on the basis of Japanese value sets. Summary values by age and sex were 
calculated to obtain Japanese normative values. A multiple linear model was used 
to examine relationships between these values and diseases and symptoms.
RESULTS: We collected 10 183 responses from 334 districts. The mean EQ-5D-5L 
index values were 0.821 (male) and 0.774 (female) in the age group of 80 to 89 
years, which were lower compared with 0.978 (male) and 0.967 (female) in the age 
group of 16 to 19 years. Similar trends were observed for the HUI3 values. Age, 
sex, household income, and education level had a significant influence on the 
values of both instruments. When measured with the EQ-5D-5L, Parkinson disease, 
dementia, and stroke were associated with the largest disutility (>0.2), and the 
disutility for depression was approximately 0.18. In contrast, the HUI3 
disutility values for Parkinson disease and dementia were approximately 0.4.
CONCLUSIONS: This study established the Japanese population norms of the 
EQ-5D-5L and HUI3, which can be used in healthcare decision making and 
contribute to a more reliable analysis of economic evaluations.
