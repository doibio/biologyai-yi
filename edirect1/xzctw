INTRODUCTION: A trial-based assessment was completed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of ceritinib as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase.
METHODS: Based on the disease situation of advanced NSCLC, a Markov model was 
constructed to estimate the costs and benefits of ceritinib and platinum-based 
chemotherapy. The cost information and health utilities were obtained from 
published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. 
The stability of the model was verified by sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The base case analysis results indicated that compared with 
platinum-based chemotherapy, ceritinib therapy would increase benefits in a 5-, 
10- and 15-year time horizon, with extra costs of $230,661.61, $149,321.52 and 
$136,414.43 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. The most 
sensitive parameter in the model analysis was the cost of ceritinib. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that at the current price of 
ceritinib, the chance of ceritinib being cost-effective was 0 at the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $27,142.85 per quality-adjusted life-year (three 
times the per capita gross domestic product of China).
CONCLUSION: As a first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with rearrangement of 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ceritinib is unlikely to be cost-effective at the 
current price from the Chinese healthcare perspective. To meet the treatment 
demands of patients, it may be a better option to reduce the price or provide 
appropriate drug assistance policies.

INTRODUCTION: The gold standard treatment for large renal masses is a radical 
nephrectomy and the removal of tumor thrombi from the large vessels. Here, we 
discussed the repair of a vena cava defect using a polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE) graft after a radical nephrectomy and vena cava resection.
CASE: A 69-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with right-sided pain 
and 10 kg of weight loss over the previous 3 months. The computed tomography 
showed that the right kidney was 23 x 13 cm in size, with a 7 x 6 x 7 cm 
contrast-enhanced mass at the renal ilum level. The patient underwent a radical 
nephrectomy, and the vena cava defect was repaired using a PTFE graft. There was 
also tumor infiltration in the proximal third of the left renal vein. The renal 
vein defect was also repaired using a PTFE graft, and the end of the graft was 
sutured to the vena cava graft at a right angle. The histopathological 
examination showed a Fuhrman grade 4 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with focal 
sarcomatoid differentiation areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of patients with RCCs and inferior vena cava (IVC) 
tumor thrombi should be planned with an experienced team, including a 
cardiovascular surgeon and liver transplantation team. In these patients, the 
comorbidities, life expectancy, and imaging methods should be considered for 
treatment planning in experienced centers. The tumor stage, probability of 
invasion, and patient's performance status should also be determined using 
magnetic resonance imaging during the preoperative period. Finally, the needs 
for a graft or tubular patch, sternotomy, and chemotherapeutic agents after the 
nephrectomy should be discussed using a multidisciplinary approach.

BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common problem that affects many 
British women. When initial medical treatment is unsuccessful, the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends surgical options such as 
endometrial ablation (EA) or hysterectomy. Although clinically and economically 
more effective than EA, total hysterectomy necessitates a longer hospital stay 
and is associated with slower recovery and a higher risk of complications. 
Improvements in endoscopic equipment and training have made laparoscopic 
supracervical hysterectomy (LASH) accessible to most gynaecologists. This 
operation could preserve the advantages of total hysterectomy and reduce the 
risk of complications.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LASH 
with second-generation EA in women with HMB.
DESIGN: A parallel-group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Allocation 
was by remote web-based randomisation (1 : 1 ratio). Surgeons and participants 
were not blinded to the allocated procedure.
SETTING: Thirty-one UK secondary and tertiary hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Women aged < 50 years with HMB. Exclusion criteria included plans 
to conceive; endometrial atypia; abnormal cytology; uterine cavity size > 11 cm; 
any fibroids > 3 cm; contraindications to laparoscopic surgery; previous EA; and 
inability to give informed consent or complete trial paperwork.
INTERVENTIONS: LASH compared with second-generation EA.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary clinical outcome measures were (1) patient 
satisfaction and (2) Menorrhagia Multi-Attribute Quality-of-Life Scale (MMAS) 
score at 15 months post randomisation. The primary economic outcome was 
incremental cost (NHS perspective) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: A total of 330 participants were randomised to each group (total 
n = 660). Women randomised to LASH were more likely to be satisfied with their 
treatment than those randomised to EA (97.1% vs. 87.1%) [adjusted difference in 
proportions 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.15; adjusted odds ratio 
(OR) from ordinal logistic regression (OLR) 2.53, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.48; 
p < 0.001]. Women randomised to LASH were also more likely to have the best 
possible MMAS score of 100 (68.7% vs. 54.5%) (adjusted difference in proportions 
0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.23; adjusted OR from OLR 1.87, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.67; 
p = 0.001). Serious adverse event rates were low and similar in both groups 
(4.5% vs. 3.6%). There was a significant difference in adjusted mean costs 
between LASH (£2886) and EA (£1282) at 15 months, but no significant difference 
in QALYs. Based on an extrapolation of expected differences in cost and QALYs 
out to 10 years, LASH cost an additional £1362 for an average QALY gain of 0.11, 
equating to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £12,314 per QALY. 
Probabilities of cost-effectiveness were 53%, 71% and 80% at cost-effectiveness 
thresholds of £13,000, £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: Follow-up data beyond 15 months post randomisation are not 
available to inform cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: LASH is superior to EA in terms of clinical effectiveness. EA is 
less costly in the short term, but expected higher retreatment rates mean that 
LASH could be considered cost-effective by 10 years post procedure.
FUTURE WORK: Retreatment rates, satisfaction and quality-of-life scores at 
10-year follow-up will help to inform long-term cost-effectiveness.

Plain Language Summary: Almost 1.5 million women in England and Wales suffer 
from heavy periods. Initial treatment involves tablets or a medicated coil 
inserted within the womb. Sometimes these treatments do not work and many women 
need an operation, either endometrial ablation (EA) (removing the lining of the 
womb) or a full hysterectomy (complete removal of the womb). Previous studies 
have shown that a full hysterectomy is better at relieving symptoms, but the 
risk of complications during surgery is higher and patients take longer to 
recover fully. A newer operation, laparoscopic (keyhole) supracervical 
hysterectomy, or ‘LASH’, removes only the part of the womb that causes periods 
and preserves the cervix or neck of the womb. Women who have LASH can expect 
fewer complications, earlier discharge from hospital and quicker recovery time. 
In this study, we compared EA with LASH by asking women who had either procedure 
how they felt about it 1 year after their operation. Regardless of which 
operation they had, most women were very satisfied and felt that their symptoms 
were better. However, the results were much better for those who had the LASH 
operation, although these women stayed in hospital for longer and took more time 
to recover. There was no difference in complications from either surgery, 
although nearly 1 in 20 women who had an EA returned within 1 year to have their 
wombs removed in a second operation. Although LASH led to a greater improvement 
in symptoms and levels of satisfaction, it was more expensive in terms of costs 
incurred by both the health service and society. Given that some women who had 
an EA are likely to need a second operation in the future, LASH surgery may 
provide better value for money in the long term.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the main tool for early 
detection, risk stratification and monitoring of prostate cancer (PCa). However, 
there are controversies about the use of PSA as a population screening test 
because of the high potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated. 
The net benefit of screening is unclear and according to the available 
recommendations, it should be offered to well-informed men with an adequate 
health status and a life-expectancy of at least 10 years or to men at elevated 
risk of having PCa. In addition, the factors that influence test results are 
unclear, as is impact of false positive or negative results on patient 
health.Our objective is to assess the clinical and analytical factors associated 
with the presence of false positive and false negative results and the 
diagnostic/therapeutic process followed by these patients.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective observational cohort study will be carried 
out. We will include a cohort of patients with a positive PSA result (1.081 
patients) and a sample of patients with negative results (572 patients); both 
will be followed for 2 years by reviewing medical records to assess the 
variables associated with these results, as well as characteristics of patient 
management after a positive PSA value. We will include those patients with a PSA 
determination from 2 hospitals in the Valencian Community. Patients who have 
been previously diagnosed with prostate cancer or who are being followed for 
previous high PSA values will be excluded.
DISCUSSION: The study will estimate the frequency of false positive and false 
negative PSA results in routine clinical practice, and allow us to quantify the 
potential harm caused.

Aims: OnabotulinumtoxinA is recommended by NICE for the treatment of chronic 
migraine. This economic evaluation provides updated estimates of the 
cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine using new utility 
estimates in an existing model structure.Methods: A previously published model 
was revised to include EQ-5D utility estimates from a large observational study 
(REPOSE; n = 633). Efficacy data were taken from the pooled phase III PREEMPT 
clinical trial program, while resource utilization estimates were obtained from 
the International Burden of Migraine Study (IBMS). The model estimated costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over 2 years from the UK NHS 
perspective.Results: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment resulted in total discounted 
incremental costs of £1,204 and an incremental discounted QALY gain of 0.07 
compared with placebo in patients with chronic migraine who have previously 
failed three or more preventive treatments, corresponding to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £16,306 per QALY gained. Scenario analysis 
showed that the administration of onabotulinumtoxinA by a specialist nurse 
rather than a neurology consultant reduced the ICER from £16,306 to £13,832 per 
QALY gained. Removal of the positive stopping rule recommended in current NICE 
guidance increased the ICER to £20,768 per QALY for onabotulinumtoxinA vs. 
placebo. Combining these two scenarios produced an ICER of £17,686 per QALY 
gained.Conclusion: NICE recommended onabotulinumtoxinA for the prevention of 
chronic migraine in 2012 amid concerns about the uncertainty of ICER estimates, 
with a positive stopping rule used to manage some of these uncertainties. Since 
the publication of the NICE guidance, the REPOSE study provides a more recent 
source of utility data based on real-world evidence. The results of analyses 
including these utilities suggest that the application of the positive stopping 
rule may not be necessary to ensure cost-effectiveness and that this aspect of 
the current NICE guidance for onabotulinumtoxinA may merit reconsideration.

CLINICAL QUESTION: Recent 15-year updates of sigmoidoscopy screening trials 
provide new evidence on the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening. 
Prompted by the new evidence, we asked: "Does colorectal cancer screening make 
an important difference to health outcomes in individuals initiating screening 
at age 50 to 79? And which screening option is best?"
CURRENT PRACTICE: Numerous guidelines recommend screening, but vary on 
recommended test, age and screening frequency. This guideline looks at the 
evidence and makes recommendations on screening for four screening options: 
faecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year, FIT every two years, a single 
sigmoidoscopy, or a single colonoscopy.
RECOMMENDATIONS: These recommendations apply to adults aged 50-79 years with no 
prior screening, no symptoms of colorectal cancer, and a life expectancy of at 
least 15 years. For individuals with an estimated 15-year colorectal cancer risk 
below 3%, we suggest no screening (weak recommendation). For individuals with an 
estimated 15-year risk above 3%, we suggest screening with one of the four 
screening options: FIT every year, FIT every two years, a single sigmoidoscopy, 
or a single colonoscopy (weak recommendation). With our guidance we publish the 
linked research, a graphic of the absolute harms and benefits, a clear 
description of how we reached our value judgments, and linked decision aids.
HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: A guideline panel including patients, 
clinicians, content experts and methodologists produced these recommendations 
using GRADE and in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines. A linked 
systematic review of colorectal cancer screening trials and microsimulation 
modelling were performed to inform the panel of 15-year screening benefits and 
harms. The panel also reviewed each screening option's practical issues and 
burdens. Based on their own experience, the panel estimated the magnitude of 
benefit typical members of the population would value to opt for screening and 
used the benefit thresholds to inform their recommendations.
THE EVIDENCE: Overall there was substantial uncertainty (low certainty evidence) 
regarding the 15-year benefits, burdens and harms of screening. Best estimates 
suggested that all four screening options resulted in similar colorectal cancer 
mortality reductions. FIT every two years may have little or no effect on cancer 
incidence over 15 years, while FIT every year, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy 
may reduce cancer incidence, although for FIT the incidence reduction is small 
compared with sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. Screening related serious 
gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events are rare. The magnitude of 
the benefits is dependent on the individual risk, while harms and burdens are 
less strongly associated with cancer risk.
UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: Based on benefits, harms, and burdens of 
screening, the panel inferred that most informed individuals with a 15-year risk 
of colorectal cancer of 3% or higher are likely to choose screening, and most 
individuals with a risk of below 3% are likely to decline screening. Given 
varying values and preferences, optimal care will require shared decision 
making.

OBJECTIVE: Adults with serious mental illnesses have a lower life expectancy 
attributable to many factors including metabolic disorders and cancer. Access to 
cancer screening has been shown to decrease morbidity and increase chances of 
survival. This study examined access to cancer screening services among 
individuals with serious mental illnesses served by a community behavioral 
health care agency partial hospitalization program at four locations. METHOD: A 
self-administered paper-and-pencil survey was provided to adults attending 
partial hospitalization programs. The survey consisted of open- and closed-ended 
questions about utilization, access to, and barriers to cervical, breast, and 
colorectal cancer screenings. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 136 
individuals. Participant screening rates were above national rates for cervical 
and breast cancer but lower for colorectal cancer. The main cited barrier to 
receiving the screening tests was lack of physician recommendations. 
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric nurses are ideally suited to communicate with this 
population and other behavioral health care professions about the importance of 
these screenings. Communication should also advocate for improved education and 
increased support for cancer screenings to address this health care disparity.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities in longevity have been found in all 
European countries. We aimed to assess which determinants make the largest 
contribution to these inequalities.
METHODS: We did an international comparative study of inequalities in risk 
factors for shorter life expectancy in Europe. We collected register-based 
mortality data and survey-based risk factor data from 15 European countries. We 
calculated partial life expectancies between the ages of 35 years and 80 years 
by education and gender and determined the effect on mortality of changing the 
prevalence of eight risk factors-father with a manual occupation, low income, 
few social contacts, smoking, high alcohol consumption, high bodyweight, low 
physical exercise, and low fruit and vegetable consumption-among people with a 
low level of education to that among people with a high level of education 
(upward levelling scenario), using population attributable fractions.
FINDINGS: In all countries, a substantial gap existed in partial life expectancy 
between people with low and high levels of education, of 2·3-8·2 years among men 
and 0·6-4·5 years among women. The risk factors contributing most to the gap in 
life expectancy were smoking (19·8% among men and 18·9% among women), low income 
(9·7% and 13·4%), and high bodyweight (7·7% and 11·7%), but large differences 
existed between countries in the contribution of risk factors. Sensitivity 
analyses using the prevalence of risk factors in the most favourable country 
(best practice scenario) showed that the potential for reducing the gap might be 
considerably smaller. The results were also sensitive to varying assumptions 
about the mortality risks associated with each risk factor.
INTERPRETATION: Smoking, low income, and high bodyweight are quantitatively 
important entry points for policies to reduce educational inequalities in life 
expectancy in most European countries, but priorities differ between countries. 
A substantial reduction of inequalities in life expectancy requires policy 
actions on a broad range of health determinants.

Aging behaviours are significantly different in females and males, e.g., the 
former have a longer life expectancy, but consistently a weaker muscle force. 
Our purpose is to analyse possible gender-differential declines of skeletal 
muscle performance. The method to find out the decline of performances with 
aging is based on a parametric analysis of the World Records of Master athletes 
in different Track and Field events. The analysis is a transformation 
(normalization) of sports results into dimensionless parameters ranging from the 
maximum value of 1 (for the absolute world record) to decreasing values with 
decreasing performances. Master athletes compete in age groups of 5 years till 
the age of 100 years, thus their World Records are lists of up to 16 data. 
Results of the normalization procedure are trend-lines indicating that the 
decline starts not later than the age of thirty years for both women and women. 
The decline with aging of the muscle performances indicates only minor gender 
differences in the aging process and all trend-lines tend to zero at about the 
age of 110 years. The approach, making use of a homogeneous cohort of testers, 
gets rid of the main confounding factors biasing other kind of studies of the 
muscle performance decline with aging, in particular clinical studies. Comparing 
normalized female and male World Records of Master athletes, a surprise emerged: 
aging decline is very similar, if not identical, the unique exception to the 
general rule of gender differences in sports activities. The substantial 
identity of decline trends among females and males suggests that neuro-hormonal 
differences among genders poorly influence the aging decline, being conceivably 
related to fundamental cell bioregulators, such as those of cellular energy 
metabolism and/or their epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Later line chemotherapy (≥2nd lines) such as Docetaxel or 
immunotherapy is frequently used. As the life expectancy of lung cancer patients 
is getting longer, we need to provide more treatment options. Other treatment 
options are not well documented except for Doxetaxel and immunotherapy. 
Therefore, the efficacy of paclitaxel plus TS1 (TTS1) is warranted.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the chart records of our non-small cell 
lung cancer patients who were treated between 2010 and 2013. Clinical 
characteristics, type of tumor, EGFR mutation status, and treatment response to 
first-line EGFR-TKI therapy and efficacy of TTS1, were collected.
RESULTS: Twenty eight patients were enrolled in this study. No patients archived 
complete response and seven patients had partial response (ORR: 25%). The 
disease control rate was 60.7% (17/28). The progression free survival (PFS) was 
4.0 months and overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months. Of them, 17 had EGFR 
mutations, eight EGFR wild type, and three were unknown EGFR status. After TTS1 
treatment, patients with EGFR mutations had better PFS (4.9 months vs. 1.8 
months) and OS (15.5 months vs. 7.2 months) compared with those of EGFR wild 
type.
CONCLUSIONS: TTS1 are effective later line chemotherapy, especially in tumor 
EGFR mutated patients. Paclitaxel plus TS1 is another treatment of choice for 
NSCLC patients before a more effective treatment strategy is found.

Individual specialization, when individuals exploit only a subset of resources 
utilized by the population, is a widespread phenomenon. It provides the basis 
for evolutionary diversification and can impact population and community 
dynamics. Both phenotypic traits and environmental conditions are predicted to 
influence individual specialization; however, its adaptive consequences are 
poorly understood, particularly among large mammalian carnivores that play an 
important role in shaping ecosystems. We used observations of 2,960 kills made 
by 49 leopards Panthera pardus in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, South Africa, to 
quantify the magnitude of individual dietary specialization in a solitary large 
carnivore, and to examine the proximate and ultimate drivers of this behaviour. 
We found evidence of individual specialization in leopard diet, with respect to 
both the species and size of prey killed. Males tended to be more specialized 
than females, likely because they could access a wider range of prey due to 
larger body size. Similarly, individuals that encountered a greater diversity of 
prey tended to be more specialized. Our results confirmed that ecological 
opportunity was a key determinant of individual specialization; however, 
contrary to predictions, per capita resource availability (and by extension, 
intraspecific competition) did not affect the degree of specialization exhibited 
by individuals. Surprisingly, dietary specialization appeared to disadvantage 
male leopards. Specialist males overlapped with fewer resident females, had 
fewer cubs born on their home ranges and had fewer cubs survive to independence 
on their home ranges than generalist males. This may have resulted from the high 
degree of environmental stochasticity experienced during our study, as dietary 
specialization is expected to advantage individuals more during periods of 
resource predictability. In summary, we showed that a species usually considered 
to be a dietary generalist was in fact a heterogeneous collection of specialist 
and generalist individuals. Individual specialization is typically assumed to be 
maintained by disruptive and/or fluctuating selection; hence, the somewhat 
paradoxical coexistence of both in the same population might be explained by a 
dynamic evolutionary equilibrium that exists between specialists and 
generalists, in which each benefit under different conditions.

Valuing the Q in QALYs: Does providing patients' ratings affect population 
values?

OBJECTIVE: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are used to measure the health 
benefits associated with treatments. QALYs are derived from objective mortality 
data weighted by assessments made by the general population of the impact on 
health-related quality of life associated with particular health states. In this 
study, a simple change is introduced to improve the validity of QALYs by giving 
raters information about how people living in the health states rate the health 
states.
METHOD: Participants from the general population (N = 155) judged 3 health 
states using a standard valuation technique after being randomly allocated to 1 
of 2 groups. The intervention group was given patients' mean ratings of their 
own health states from worst to best imaginable health (0-100 scale) before 
providing their valuations, while the control group was given this information 
only after providing their valuations. The participants in both groups also 
indicated whether patients' mean ratings were higher, broadly similar, or lower 
than they previously expected.
RESULTS: When the mean ratings given by patients were higher (lower) than 
expected, participants in the intervention group provided significantly higher 
(lower) valuations than participants in the control group. These findings show 
that participants adjust their valuations of a health state in the direction of 
the appraisals of those experiencing that state.
CONCLUSION: Insofar as policymakers are committed to valuing health states using 
valuations given by people from the general population, it is desirable to 
elicit more informed values by providing people with information on how patients 
rate those states. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

Aim: Therapy for lupus nephritis (LN) requires treatment with immunosuppressive 
regimens, often including intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY), mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine. Additionally, tacrolimus (original form or 
generic) is recommended to treat LN patients in Asia, including China. However, 
the cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus therapy has not previously been assessed. 
We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus in the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe LN versus standard therapies in China. Materials & methods: 
This cost-effectiveness model combined a decision-tree/Markov-model structure to 
map transitions between health states during induction and maintenance treatment 
phases. Induction with tacrolimus, IVCY or MMF, was followed by tacrolimus, MMF 
or azathioprine maintenance. Results: According to the model, during induction, 
complete remission rates were higher with tacrolimus versus IVCY (relative risk 
1.40 vs IVCY [deterministic sensitivity analysis minimum 0.92, maximum 2.13]) 
and time to response was shorter. Relapse rates were lower with tacrolimus 
versus azathioprine or MMF during maintenance. Tacrolimus induction and 
maintenance was the most cost-effective regimen, incurring the lowest total 
costs (CN¥180,448) with the highest quality-adjusted life-years. Conclusion: The 
model demonstrated that tacrolimus use in both induction and maintenance therapy 
may be an efficacious and cost-effective treatment for LN in China.

Obesity reduces the quality of life and life expectancy, whereas nonoperative 
interventions have shown poor results so far. Statins effectively combat 
hypercholesterolemia but are not well tolerated at high doses, raising the need 
for coprescription with cholesterol sorbents and/or absorption inhibitors. 
Montmorillonite (MMT) clay was found to attenuate hypercholesterolemia and 
obesity by reducing cholesterol and fat absorption. However, acicular clay-like 
sepiolite may offer better results due to its more substantial adsorption of 
nonpolar molecules. We herein aimed at (1) assessing in vitro the capacity of 
sepiolite to adsorb edible oil and cholesterol compared with that of MMT and (2) 
assessing in vivo the effect of continuous feeding on a high-fat 
high-cholesterol diet (HFD) (53.6% w/w fat and 0.2% cholesterol) supplemented 
with 5% (w/w) edible sepiolite, on diet-induced obesity rate, 
hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy showed in vitro that sepiolite adsorption of olive oil and 
cholesterol was five to eight times greater than that of MMT clay. Sepiolite 
supplementation to HFD fed to mature mice for 12.5 weeks resulted in lower total 
blood cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels and attenuated body weight gain, by 
reducing fat gain. Sepiolite supplementation did not affect energy intake but 
increased fecal extraction of sterols and lipids, without notable side effects. 
These results demonstrate that supplementing a HFD with sepiolite attenuates 
gastrointestinal absorption of dietary lipids and sterols, thus mitigating 
obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Further exploration of the 
efficacy, mechanism of action, and safety of sepiolite as a food supplement for 
combating the metabolic syndrome is needed.

Background: As patients' accurate understanding of their prognosis is essential 
for informed end-of-life planning, identifying associated factors is important. 
Objective: We examine if receiving palliative chemotherapy or radiation, and the 
perception of those treatments as curative or noncurative, is associated with 
prognostic understanding. Design: Cross-sectional analyses from a multisite, 
observational study. Setting/Subjects: Patients with advanced cancers refractory 
to at least one chemotherapy regimen (N = 334). Measurements: In structured 
interviews, patients reported whether they were receiving chemotherapy or 
radiation, and whether its intent was curative or not. Their responses were 
categorized into three groups: patients not receiving chemotherapy/radiation (no 
cancer treatment group); patients receiving chemotherapy/radiation and 
misperceiving it as curative (treatment misperception group); and patients 
receiving chemotherapy/radiation and accurately perceiving it as noncurative 
(accurate treatment perception group). Patients also reported on various aspects 
of their prognostic understanding (e.g., life expectancy). Results: Eighty-six 
percent of the sample was receiving chemotherapy or radiation; of those, 16.7% 
reported the purpose of treatment to be curative. The no-treatment group had 
higher prognostic understanding scores compared with the treatment misperception 
group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.00, p < 0.001). However, the accurate 
treatment perception group had the highest prognostic understanding scores in 
comparison to the no-treatment group (AOR = 2.04, p < 0.05) and the treatment 
misperception group (AOR = 10.19, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Depending on patient 
perceptions of curative intent, receipt of palliative chemotherapy or radiation 
is associated with better or worse prognostic understanding. Research should 
examine if enhancing patients' understanding of treatment intent can improve 
accurate prognostic expectations.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most malignant and aggressive primary brain 
tumor, with a mean life expectancy of less than 15 months. The malignant nature 
of GBM prompts the need for further research on its tumorigenesis and novel 
treatments to improve its outcome. One of the promising research targets is 
autophagy, a fundamental metabolic process of degrading and recycling cellular 
components. Interventions to activate or inhibit autophagy have both been 
proposed as GBM therapies, suggesting a controversial, context-dependent role of 
autophagy in GBM tumorigenesis. In this review, we highlight the molecular links 
between GBM and autophagy with the focus on the effects of autophagy on the 
stemness maintenance, metabolism and proteostasis in GBM tumorigenesis. 
Understanding the molecular pathways involved in autophagy target is critical 
for GBM therapy.

BACKGROUND: GPs can play a central role in palliative care delivery. However, 
little is known about their views on what constitutes best practice care at the
