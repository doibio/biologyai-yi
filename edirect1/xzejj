OBJECTIVES: The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have goals and 
targets, including food insecurity and health outcomes. Hence, information about 
socioeconomic variables that determine the health outcomes of people is 
essential for health-related research, planning, and policy development. 
Therefore, this data paper aims to present (describe) the dataset of eight 
socioeconomic variables for 31 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries from 2001 to 
2018.
DATA DESCRIPTIONS: The dataset was official information obtained via open online 
sources from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the World Bank (WB), 
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It included 558 
observations and eight variables, such as life expectancy (LEXP), infant 
mortality (INFMOR), the prevalence of undernourishment (PRUND), average dietary 
energy supply (AVRDES), Gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC), general 
government health expenditure (GOVEXP), urbanisation (URBAN), and mean years of 
schooling (MNSCHOOL). Moreover, all the data estimation is conducted by 
Statistical Software (STATA) version 15. This paper achieved its intended 
objective with a detailed and understandable description.

While the direct effects of the pandemic are well documented, less is known 
about the indirect ones, including changes in healthcare provision or human 
behavior. This paper aims to study the impact of indirect consequences on 
mortality, focusing on two leading causes (cardiovascular diseases, COVID-19) 
and places of death in Czechia, during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most 
severely affected European countries. The analysis was performed using data from 
the Czech Statistical Office and the Institute of Health Information and 
Statistics. The study compares annual mortality changes during three time 
periods: pre-pandemic (2018-2019), pandemic beginning and peaking (2020-2021), 
and pandemic fading (2022). Pandemic years were covered by the WHO public health 
emergency of international concern. Abridged life tables were computed, and 
Pollard's decomposition was used to calculate the contributions of causes and 
places of death on annual differences in life expectancy. Seasonal decomposition 
of monthly time series revealed an increase in cardiovascular mortality at home 
or in social care facilities corresponding to limitations in healthcare. While 
COVID-19 had a systemic negative effect on life expectancy during the pandemic, 
the impact of cardiovascular mortality according to place of death changed over 
time. This study contributes to the evidence base of systemic risks during 
health crises and emergency response.

As one of the most prevalent neurotrophic factors in the central nervous system 
(CNS), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a significant role in CNS 
injury by binding to its specific receptor Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B 
(TrkB). The BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway is crucial for neuronal survival, 
structural changes, and plasticity. BDNF acts as an axonal growth and extension 
factor, a pro-survival factor, and a synaptic modulator in the CNS. BDNF also 
plays an important role in the maintenance and plasticity of neuronal circuits. 
Several studies have demonstrated the importance of BDNF in the treatment and 
recovery of neurodegenerative and neurotraumatic disorders. By undertaking 
in-depth study on the mechanism of BDNF/TrkB function, important novel 
therapeutic strategies for treating neuropsychiatric disorders have been 
discovered. In this review, we discuss the expression patterns and mechanisms of 
the TrkB/BDNF signaling pathway in CNS damage and introduce several intriguing 
small molecule TrkB receptor agonists produced over the previous several 
decades.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the burden of ocular injuries on deployed United States 
service members by calculating Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study SUBJECTS: US service members 
with ocular injuries sustained in combat zones from 2001-2020 METHODS: Using 
data from the Defense and Veterans Eye Injury and Vision Registry (DVEIVR), 
health states and duration of injuries were identified using patient injury, 
final visual acuity, medication, procedures, and History of Present Illness 
data. These health states were mapped to disability weights from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Average duration of injury/illness was calculated 
until remission or death. For the latter, life expectancy at age of sustaining 
injury, as identified from United States Life Tables from the National Vital 
Statistics Reports 2020 was used. Using Defense Manpower Data Center reports 
capturing number of service members deployed per year, incidence rates were 
calculated for ocular injury and DALYs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DALYs of ocular injury RESULTS: 17555 patients sustained 
ocular injury that incurred DALYs. In total, these injuries resulted in 11214 
DALYs (average 0.64 DALYs per included patient; 20.6 DALYs per 10000 US service 
members per year). Severe impairment of distance vision (77.9%) and blindness 
(10.6%) were the primary contributors of DALYs. While only 9.3% of patients 
sustained a permanent ocular injury, permanent disability accounted for 99.5% of 
total DALYs. The average yearly incidence rate of ocular injury was 32.0 cases 
per 10000 US service members. Foreign body was the most frequent injury type 
(2754 occurrences) followed by abrasion (2419 occurrences) and multiple injury 
types (1429 occurrences), while the most DALYs occurred in patients with 
multiple injury types (2485 DALYs) followed by abrasion (accounting for 725 
DALYs), and foreign body (accounting for 461 DALYs.) CONCLUSION: We report 
higher average DALYs per case ratio among US service members compared to the 
general population studied by the GBD Study, highlighting the differences in 
probabilities of permanent injury between the two studies. Our study provides a 
novel understanding of the impact of ocular injuries on active-duty service 
members and lays the groundwork for further research and interventions to 
mitigate their burden.

Antibiotics have substantially improved life expectancy in past decades through 
direct control or prevention of infections. However, emerging antibiotic 
resistance and lack of access to effective antibiotics have significantly 
increased the death toll from infectious diseases, making it one of the biggest 
threats to global health. Addressing the antibiotic crisis to meet future needs 
require considerable investment in both research and development along with 
ensuring a viable marketplace to encourage innovation. Fortunately, there has 
been some improvement in the number of antibiotics approved or in different 
phases of development through collective global efforts. However, the universal 
access to these essential novel and generic antibiotics, especially in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), is challenged by poor economic incentives, 
regulatory hurdles and poor health infrastructure. Recently, the agenda of 
securing and expanding access has gained global attention. Several mechanisms 
are now being proposed and implemented to improve access to essential 
antibiotics. This review provides an insight into the major barriers to 
antibiotic access as well as the models proposed and implemented to mitigate 
accessibility issues. These models include but are not limited to market entry 
rewards, subscription models and transferable exclusivity vouchers. Further, 
global access programmes including, Global Antibiotic Research and Development 
Partnership, Antimicrobial Resistance Action Fund and SECURE Platform are 
discussed. We also propose the way forward for improving access in LMICs with 
suggested measures to improve access to generic and novel antibiotics.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Rendu-Weber 
syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by vascular 
malformations. This comprehensive review aimed to provide an overview and 
summarize various aspects of HHT, including the genetic abnormalities, 
complications associated with visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), 
prognosis of HHT, quality of life (QOL), and treatment of epistaxis. In 
addition, this review highlights the challenges in diagnosing HHT and emphasizes 
the critical role of otolaryngologists in the early detection of HHT. 
Otolaryngologists can refer patients with refractory epistaxis for AVM screening 
to expedite intervention. Mutation of the genes involved in the transforming 
growth factor-β signaling pathway leads to the incidence of HHT, resulting in 
the formation of abnormal blood vessel formation. These vascular malformations 
commonly manifest as telangiectasia on the skin and mucous membranes; however, 
epistaxis remains the hallmark symptom of HHT. The impact of HHT goes beyond the 
visible symptoms and often includes the formation of life-threatening visceral 
AVMs in the lungs, liver, and brain. The prognosis of patients with HHT is 
closely related to the development of these complications, necessitating timely 
diagnosis and intervention. Refractory epistaxis diminishes the QOL of patients 
with HHT. The management of epistaxis ranges from conservative measures to 
advanced interventions such as prevention, conservative treatments, ablation, 
surgical procedures, and the administration of anti-angiogenic agents. However, 
effective management requires a multidisciplinary approach. The diagnosis of HHT 
remains challenging due to its variable presentation and lack of awareness among 
physicians. This review highlights the importance of reducing the duration 
between symptom onset and diagnosis. Otolaryngologists who are experienced in 
the management of refractory epistaxis can aid in identifying potential cases of 
HHT. They can facilitate the initiation of screening for visceral AVMs via 
prompt recognition of the signs and symptoms of HHT, contributing to improved 
patient outcomes. Early detection and intervention through screening can extend 
the life expectancy of patients with HHT to levels comparable with that of the 
general population. In conclusion, this review provides insight into various 
aspects of HHT and emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis and 
intervention in the mitigation of the potentially life-threatening complications 
associated with this disorder. Otolaryngologists play a critical role in this 
process, serving as gatekeepers to the identification of cases of HHT and 
implementation of appropriate screening and management pathways, thereby 
improving the life expectancy and QOL of patients.

PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare isokinetic knee muscle (extension and flexion) 
strength, single-leg hop (SLH) test performance, anterior knee laxity, 
subjective knee function, and the 2-year revision surgery risk between patients 
who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with 
semitendinosus tendon (ST) autografts and patients who underwent ACLR with ST 
and gracilis tendon (ST-G) autografts.
METHODS: We identified patients aged 16 years or older who underwent primary 
ACLR with hamstring tendon autografts at our institution from January 2005 to 
December 2020 and had no associated ligament injuries. Isokinetic knee muscle 
strength and SLH test performance were assessed 6 months postoperatively. 
Anterior knee laxity (KT-1000 arthrometer, 134 N) was assessed preoperatively 
and 6 months postoperatively. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score 
(KOOS) was collected preoperatively and 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Patients 
who underwent revision ACLR at any institution in Sweden within 2 years of 
primary surgery were identified through the Swedish National Knee Ligament 
Registry.
RESULTS: A total of 6,974 patients (5,479 with ST and 1,495 with ST-G) were 
included. There were no significant differences in extension and flexion 
strength or SLH test performance between the groups. Preoperatively, there was 
no significant difference in knee laxity between the ST and ST-G groups. 
Postoperatively, the ST-G group had significantly increased mean side-to-side 
(STS) laxity (2.1 ± 2.3 mm vs 1.7 ± 2.2 mm, P < .001) and showed a trend toward 
increased STS laxity according to the International Knee Documentation Committee 
form, with significantly fewer patients with STS laxity of 2 mm or less (58.4% 
vs 65.8%) and significantly more patients with STS laxity between 3 and 5 mm 
(35.0% vs 29.9%) or greater than 5 mm (6.6% vs 4.3%) (P < .001). The only 
significant difference in subjective knee function was for the KOOS Quality of 
Life subscale score in favor of the ST group preoperatively (37.3 ± 21.4 vs 35.1 
± 19.9, P = .001). No other significant differences between the groups were 
found preoperatively and 1 and 2 years postoperatively for any of the KOOS 
subscales. The overall revision ACLR rate within 2 years of primary surgery was 
2.0% (138 of 6,974 patients). The revision ACLR risk in the ST-G group (1.7%, 25 
of 1,495 patients) was not significantly different from that in the ST group 
(2.1%, 113 of 5,479 patients) (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 
0.50-1.24; P = .32).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the gracilis tendon to an ST autograft was not 
associated with knee muscle strength, SLH test performance, subjective knee 
function, or the risk of revision surgery after ACLR.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

PURPOSE: Treatment advancements have improved life expectancy for adolescents 
and young adults (AYAs) with an uncertain and/or poor cancer prognosis (UPCP) 
and change clinical practice. This improved survival requires a different 
approach and specific expertise to meet the needs of this group. The aim of this 
study is to explore the health care experiences of AYAs with a UPCP.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter qualitative study using semi-structured 
interviews and elements of the grounded theory by Corbin and Strauss.
RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 46 AYAs with a UPCP. They were on 
average 33.4 years old (age range 23-44), and most of them were woman (63%). 
Additionally, five AYAs with a UPCP participated as AYA research partners in two 
focus groups. They were on average 31.8 years old and four of them were woman. 
AYAs with a UPCP reported four pillars for a satisfied healthcare experience: 
(1) trust, (2) tailored communication, (3) holistic empathic open attitude, and 
(4) care being offered (pro-)actively. They reported both optimal and suboptimal 
experiences about distrust based on a delay in diagnostic trajectory, lack of 
tailored communication and discussion of sensitive topics, preference for a 
holistic approach, and struggles with finding the way to get additional 
healthcare support.
CONCLUSION: For AYAs with a UPCP, it is important that both age-specific issues 
and issues related to the UPCP are understood and addressed; however, this seems 
not yet optimally implemented in clinical practice. This emphasizes the 
importance of providing this patient group with tailored care incorporating both 
aspects. Healthcare professionals need to be supported with training and tools 
to understand the healthcare needs of AYAs with a UPCP. AYAs can be empowered to 
take more control over their own healthcare needs.

In an era marked by a sweeping pandemic and the encroaching shadow of an energy 
crisis, the well-being and lifespan of global populations have become pressing 
concerns for every nation. This research zeroes in on life expectancy (LE), a 
powerful indicator of societal health in Oman and Qatar. Our study juxtaposes 3 
key factors affecting LE: health status and resources (HSR), macroeconomics 
(ME), and sociodemographic (SD) factors. To achieve this, we tapped into a 
comprehensive data set from the World Bank, encompassing a transformative 
3-decade span from 1990 to 2020. The intricate interplay between these factors 
and LE was deciphered through robust Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Our 
findings construct a compelling narrative: ME has an indirect yet considerable 
influence on LE-manifesting with an effect of 0.602 for Oman and 0.676 for 
Qatar. This influence is mediated by SD and HSR components. Similarly, SD 
elements impact LE indirectly-with an effect of 0.653 for Oman and 0.759 for 
Qatar- this effect is mediated by HSR. In contrast, HSR themselves wield a 
robust and direct influence on LE, indicated by an effect of 0.839 for Oman and 
0.904 for Qatar. All these aforementioned effects were statistically substantial 
(P < .001). Our research magnifies the robust direct influence of HSR on LE in 
both Oman and Qatar, simultaneously highlighting the noteworthy indirect role of 
ME and SD factors. This emphasizes the significance of adopting an integrated 
policy approach that considers all the SD, ME, and HSR factors to improve the 
population health in both countries, which are also crucial for promoting LE 
growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council region.

18-year period. Frailty was defined as the presence of ≥2 criteria (weight loss, 
weakness, self-reported exhaustion, slowness). We used the Markov chain method 
to estimate the TLE, FFLE, FLE, PFLE, and FLE with and without disability by age 
and gender. TLE at age 67 was 17.49 years (women) and 15.54 years (men); FFLE 
was 6.50 years (women) and 6.45 years (men); PFLE was 6.48 years (women) and 
5.42 years (men); FLE was 4.51 years (women) and 3.67 years (men); and FLE with 
disability was 2.13 years (women) and 1.13 years (men). In conclusion, Mexican 
American older women had fewer years of non-frail LE, more pre-frail or frail 
years, and more years with disability than men.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially fatal disease 
characterized by unpredictable, recurrent, often disabling swelling attacks. In 
a randomized phase 2 study, donidalorsen reduced HAE attack frequency and 
improved patient quality-of-life (ISIS721744-CS2, NCT04030598). We report the 
2-year interim analysis of the phase 2 open-label extension (OLE) study (ISIS 
721744-CS3, NCT04307381).
METHODS: In the OLE, the on-treatment study period consisted of fixed (weeks 
1-13, donidalorsen 80 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks [Q4W]) and flexible (weeks 
17-105, donidalorsen 80 mg Q4W, 80 mg every 8 weeks [Q8W], or 100 mg Q4W) dosing 
periods. The primary outcome was incidence and severity of treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs). The secondary outcomes included efficacy, 
pharmacodynamic, and quality-of-life assessments.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients continued in the OLE study. No serious TEAEs or 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported. Mean monthly HAE 
attack rate was 96% lower than the study run-in baseline rate (mean, 0.06/month; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.10; median, 0.04 on-treatment vs. mean, 
2.70/month; 95% CI, 1.94-3.46; median, 2.29 at baseline). Mean monthly attack 
rate for Q8W dosing (n = 8) was 0.29 (range, 0.0-1.7; 95% CI, -0.21 to 0.79; 
median, 0.00). Mean plasma prekallikrein and D-dimer concentrations decreased, 
and Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire total score improved from baseline 
to week 105 with donidalorsen.
CONCLUSION: The 2-year interim results of this phase 2 OLE study of donidalorsen 
in patients with HAE demonstrated no new safety signals; donidalorsen was well 
tolerated. There was durable efficacy with a 96% reduction in HAE attacks.

Tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) connect distant cells and mediate cargo transfer for 
intercellular communication in physiological and pathological contexts. How 
cells generate these actin-mediated protrusions to span lengths beyond those 
attainable by canonical filopodia remains unknown. Through a combination of 
micropatterning, microscopy, and optical tweezer-based approaches, we 
demonstrate that TNTs formed through the outward extension of actin achieve 
distances greater than the mean length of filopodia and that branched 
Arp2/3-dependent pathways attenuate the extent to which actin polymerizes in 
nanotubes, thus limiting their occurrence. Proteomic analysis using epidermal 
growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (Eps8) as a positive effector of TNTs 
showed that, upon Arp2/3 inhibition, proteins enhancing filament turnover and 
depolymerization were reduced and Eps8 instead exhibited heightened interactions 
with the inverted Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (I-BAR) domain protein IRSp53 that 
provides a direct connection with linear actin polymerases. Our data reveals how 
common protrusion players (Eps8 and IRSp53) form tunnelling nanotubes, and that 
when competing pathways overutilizing such proteins and monomeric actin in 
Arp2/3 networks are inhibited, processes promoting linear actin growth dominate 
to favour tunnelling nanotube formation.

INTRODUCTION: People with eating disorders (EDs) frequently report 
self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs). We aimed to replicate and extend 
findings demonstrating greater interoceptive deficits according to SITB 
severity. We predicted that interoceptive deficits would be greater among people 
with versus without lifetime SITBs and among those with multiple suicide 
attempts compared with single attempts or nonsuicidal self-injury. We also 
predicted that interoception would be increasingly impaired with greater current 
suicidality severity.
METHOD: Adults (N = 118) seeking ED treatment reported current and lifetime 
SITBs upon admission to treatment. We used planned contrasts to compare 
interoceptive deficits (self-reported using the Eating Disorders Inventory) by 
SITB and current suicidality groups (assessed by self-report and clinical 
interview).
RESULTS: Interoceptive deficits were greater among people with any SITB history 
compared to those without. People with multiple suicide attempts did not differ 
in interoceptive deficits from those with single attempts or only nonsuicidal 
self-injury. Interoceptive deficits were elevated among those with any current 
suicidality compared to those with no suicidal symptoms; interoceptive deficits 
did not differ according to severity of suicidality.
CONCLUSION: Among those with EDs, interoceptive deficits are elevated among 
those with concurrent SITBs. Interventions aimed at improving interoception may 
reduce the risk for SITBs.

Experience of less invasive surfactant administration with a 5F infant feeding 
tube in a tertiary center of low- and middle-income countries.

Research and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India.

BACKGROUND: Less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) results in less need 
for mechanical ventilation and a reduction in death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 
and intraventricular hemorrhage as outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the 
efficacy and short-term outcomes of surfactant administration by the LISA method 
using an 5F infant feeding tube in preterm infants.
METHODS: During the period from May, 2019 to August, 2022, we carried out a 
prospective observational study that included all premature infants with 
respiratory distress syndrome who were admitted to our neonatal intensive care 
unit. The study involved collecting and analyzing data on the procedural 
efficacy of LISA, vital parameters, and short-term outcomes.
RESULTS: Our study included a total of 110 infants with an average gestational 
age of 30.9 ± 1.9 weeks and a mean birthweight of 1347.5 ± 354.1 g. Of these 
infants, two required intubation during the LISA procedure, whereas 11 infants 
required intubation within 72 h after LISA. Infants with a higher pre-surfactant 
fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi O2 ) requirement, an elevated Score for Neonatal 
Acute Physiology with Perinatal Extension (SNAPPE), and the presence of sepsis 
were associated with the need for intubation within the first 72 h of life. 
Thirty-one infants also experienced a drop in saturation of peripheral oxygen 
(SpO2 ) below 80% for more than 1 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Less invasive surfactant administration was feasible and safe to 
administer via an orotracheally introduced 5F infant feeding tube in 
non-invasive ventilation to support spontaneously breathing infants between 28+0 
and 33+6  weeks of gestation.

During the radiation exposure of the body, processes similar to those 
characteristic of the natural aging of mammals occur. This phenomenon is most 
often referred to as accelerated aging. By transplanting the thymus tissue, it 
is possible to achieve a normalization of food and water consumption, a 
stabilization of weight gain, and a significant increase in the life expectancy 
of experimental animals, even after their lethal irradiation.

An economical and effective storage solution has been designed in this work for 
the storage of postharvest fruits and vegetables. Musa acuminata or banana has a 
shelf life of 5-6 days in open uncontrolled environment. This article reports a 
storage solution of M. acuminata in a controlled enclosure containing titanium 
oxide (TiO2 )-coated inner walls and irradiated with ultraviolet ray of band 
"C," an air filtration unit, 5% by volume potassium permanganate (KMnO4 ) 
solution in a clay pot, grow lights, and activated charcoal granules. The same 
fruit was kept in an uncontrolled environment too. The percentages of dark spots 
on banana (M. acuminata) upon storage in controlled and uncontrolled 
environments have been estimated using an image-processing algorithm. The 
prediction of dark spots was conducted using multi-linear and multivariate 
polynomial regression. Experimentation with optimum process parameters obtained 
with genetic algorithm resulted in a shelf life extension of 6 days as compared 
to its storage in an uncontrolled environment. The setup can be used in 
vegetable and fruit markets for the extension of shelf life of postharvest 
perishable items in a compact and cost-effective manner. The setup does not use 
any refrigeration process thereby decreasing energy requirement.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of the usage of digital guides in 
combination with low- and high-power lasers for the treatment of excessive 
gingival display, also known as "gummy smile".
CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Excessive gingival display due to altered passive 
eruption can affect patient's perception of their own esthetics and consequently 
have an impact on self-confidence. Therefore, the management of this condition 
should offer a predictable and stable long-lasting solution. To attain these 
objectives, digital planning emerges as a tool in optimizing the outcomes of 
crown lengthening surgery for this condition by enhancing precision through the 
use of surgical guides. Additionally, the usage of high- and low-powered lasers 
can provide a safe approach because of their tissue selective removal 
properties.
CONCLUSIONS: The technique described showed satisfactory clinical results in the 
short- and long-term follow-up, leading to an improvement in patients' 
self-esteem. This approach integrates digital and laser technologies to deliver 
a surgical treatment characterized by precision, efficiency, and safety.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Digital dentistry has contributed to innovative dental 
procedures, as personalizing surgical guides for patients, assisting and guiding 
incisions of the gingival margins, as well as the extension of the osteotomy, 
during the procedures for increasing the clinical crown. Furthermore, smile 
esthetics are directly related to an individual's improved emotional and social 
quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: A head and neck cancer (HNC) diagnosis significantly impacts a 
patient's quality of life (QOL). Palliative care potentially improves their QOL. 
We will conduct a scoping review to identify existing knowledge about palliative 
care interventions for patients with HNC.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review was designed in accordance with the 
JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis: Scoping Reviews and will be reported 
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Our eligibility criteria follow the 
Population, Intervention, Comparison or Control, Outcomes and Study 
characteristics framework. The population is adult patients with locally 
advanced, metastatic, unresectable and/or recurrent HNC. We include 
peer-reviewed journal articles and articles in the press, in English, reporting 
on palliative care interventions with at least two of the eight National 
Consensus Project on Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care 
domains; studies with and without comparators will be included. The outcomes are 
patient QOL (primary) and symptom severity, patients' satisfaction with care, 
patients' mood, advance care planning and place of death (secondary). We 
developed a search strategy across ten databases, to be searched from the 
inception to 11 September 2023: Medline ALL (Medline and EPub Ahead of Print and 
In-Process, In-Data-Review & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase 
Classic+Embase, Emcare and PsycINFO all from the OvidSP platform; CINAHL from 
EBSCOhost, Scopus from Elsevier, Web of Science from Clarivate and Global Index 
Medicus from WHO. We will extract data using a piloted data form and analyse the 
data through descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not needed for a scoping review. We 
will disseminate the findings to healthcare providers and policy-makers by 
publishing the results in a scientific journal.

AIM: As life expectancy increases worldwide, the prevalence and the disease 
burden of diabetes in older adults are also increasing. This study aimed to 
examine sex differences in the reciprocal relationship between glycemic control 
and depressive symptoms among older adults with diabetes by using longitudinal 
data at two timepoints.
METHODS: Wave 1 (W1, 2016-2017) and wave 2 (W2, 2018-2019) data from the Korean 
Frailty and Aging Cohort Study were used. Finally, 416 older adults with 
diabetes who satisfied the inclusion criteria were analyzed (215 males, 201 
females). The reciprocal relationship between depressive symptoms and 
glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels was examined using a cross-lagged 
panel model.
RESULTS: HbA1c levels and depressive symptoms at earlier time points were the 
most significant factors contributing to HbA1c levels and depressive symptoms at 
later timepoints. The relationship between HbA1c level and depressive symptoms 
differed according to sex. The cross-path from depressive symptoms (W1) to HbA1c 
levels (W2) was positively statistically significant in males (β = 0.18, 
SD = 0.05, P = 0.001). The path from HbA1c levels (W1) to depressive symptoms 
(W2) was positively statistically significant in females (β = 0.12, SD = 0.06, 
P = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: Early management of blood glucose levels and depressive symptoms is 
important in older adults with diabetes. Moreover, glycemic control through 
social activities in the community could be effective in relieving depressive 
symptoms in older females with diabetes, and managing depressive symptoms and 
glucose levels together could be effective in glycemic control in older males 
with diabetes. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2023; ••: ••-••.

Hair loss disorders such as androgenetic alopecia have caused serious 
disturbances to normal human life. Animal models play an important role in 
exploring pathogenesis of disease and evaluating new therapies. NIH hairless 
mice are a spontaneous hairless mouse discovered and bred in our laboratory. In
