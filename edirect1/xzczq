(cost/QALY gained) were compared to an opportunity cost-based willingness-to-pay 
threshold for Cambodia ($248/QALY).
RESULTS: The total cost of testing and treatment per patient for the full model 
of care was $925(IQR $668-1631), reducing to $376(IQR $344-422) for the 
simplified model of care. EQ-5D-5L values varied by fibrosis stage: 
decompensated cirrhosis had the lowest value, values increased during and 
following treatment. The simplified model of care was cost saving compared to no 
treatment, while the full model of care, although cost-effective compared to no 
treatment ($187/QALY), cost an additional $14 485/QALY compared to the 
simplified model, above the willingness-to-pay threshold for Cambodia. This 
result is robust to variation in parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The simplified model of care was cost saving compared to no 
treatment, emphasizing the importance of simplifying pathways of care for 
improving access to HCV treatment in low-resource settings.

The United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence considers a 
procedure to be cost-effective if the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained 
falls below a threshold of £20,000-£30,000 (€22,600-33,900; US$24,600-$36,900). 
This study used cost per quality-adjusted life year methodology to determine the 
cost-utility ratio of A1 pulley release. Pre- and postoperative EuroQol 5 
Dimensions 5 Likert scores were collected prospectively over 6 years from 192 
patients. The median pre- and postoperative indices derived from the EuroQol 5 
Dimensions 5 Likert scores were significantly different at 0.77 and 0.80. The 
mean life expectancy was 21 years. The mean number of quality-adjusted life 
years gained was 1 per patient. The mean cost-utility ratio per patient was 
£32,308 (€36,508; US$39,730) and £16,154 (€18,254; US$19,869) at 1 and 2 years, 
respectively. Provided the benefit of surgery was maintained over the remaining 
life expectancy, the cost-utility ratio decreased to £1537 (€1737; US$1891) per 
patient. A1 pulley release is cost-effective provided the benefit is maintained 
for 2 years. The procedure is also associated with a statistically significant 
improvement in quality of life.Level of evidence: III.

Life-history theory in psychology and evolutionary biology: one research 
programme or two?

The term 'life-history theory' (LHT) is increasingly often invoked in 
psychology, as a framework for integrating understanding of psychological traits 
into a broader evolutionary context. Although LHT as presented in psychology 
papers (LHT-P) is typically described as a straightforward extension of the 
theoretical principles from evolutionary biology that bear the same name 
(LHT-E), the two bodies of work are not well integrated. Here, through a close 
reading of recent papers, we argue that LHT-E and LHT-P are different research 
programmes in the Lakatosian sense. The core of LHT-E is built around ultimate 
evolutionary explanation, via explicit mathematical modelling, of how selection 
can drive divergent evolution of populations or species living under different 
demographies or ecologies. The core of LHT-P concerns measurement of 
covariation, across individuals, of multiple psychological traits; the proximate 
goals these serve; and their relation to childhood experience. Some of the links 
between LHT-E and LHT-P are false friends. For example, elements that are 
marginal in LHT-E are core commitments of LHT-P, and where explanatory 
principles are transferred from one to the other, nuance can be lost in 
transmission. The methodological rules for what grounds a prediction in theory 
are different in the two cases. Though there are major differences between LHT-E 
and LHT-P at present, there is much potential for greater integration in the 
future, through both theoretical modelling and further empirical research. This 
article is part of the theme issue 'Life history and learning: how childhood, 
caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.

BACKGROUND: As general and oral health are closely interrelated, promoting oral 
health may extend a healthy life expectancy.
AIMS: To evaluate the long-term effects of simple oral exercise (SOE) and 
chewing gum exercise on mastication, salivation, and swallowing function in 
adults aged ≥ 65 years.
METHODS: Ninety-six participants were assigned to control, SOE, and GOE (chewing 
gum exercise with SOE) groups. The SOE comprised exercises to improve 
mastication, salivation, and swallowing function. Control group participants 
performed no exercises. The intervention period was 8 weeks, followed by a 
3-week maintenance period. The Mixing Ability Index (MAI), occlusal force, 
unstimulated saliva, and repetitive saliva swallowing test were evaluated at 
baseline and 2, 5, 8, and 11 weeks later. Self-reported discomfort was 
re-evaluated after 8 weeks.
RESULTS: After 8 weeks, mean MAI differences from baseline significantly 
increased in both groups; the increase in the GOE group was largest and four 
times higher than in the control group. Mean differences of occlusal force from 
baseline increased by 56 N (SOE group) and 60 N (GOE group). The increase of 
salivation was greater in the SOE (3.6-fold) and GOE (2.2-fold) groups than in 
the control group. Furthermore, 27% and 18% of SOE and GOE group participants, 
respectively, were re-categorized as having good swallowing function. 
Participants reported less discomfort as oral functions improved.
DISCUSSION: These findings may facilitate the development of clinical practice 
guidelines for optimal oral care in older adults.
CONCLUSION: While both SOE and GOE may improve oral function in older adults, 
GOE is recommended for those with impaired mastication.

BACKGROUND: Natural plant essential oils have antimicrobial properties; however, 
essential oils are difficult to maintain in a system because of their volatile 
nature. First, we prepared microcapsules from β-cyclodextrin and oregano 
essential oil and characterized their properties. Second, the effect of 
microcapsules on the preservation of freshly cut purple yam was studied using an 
edible coating technique. Purple yams immersed in distilled water were used as 
control, and their characteristics were compared with yams coated with citric 
acid, citric acid + sodium alginate, and citric acid + sodium 
alginate + β-cyclodextrin-oregano essential oil microcapsules (CA-SA-MC) and 
stored at 4 °C for 5 days.
RESULTS: Microcapsules of oregano essential oil and β-cyclodextrin solution were 
successfully prepared via the inclusion method, with an optimal encapsulation 
efficiency of 55.14%. Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared 
spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis showed strong bonds between 
β-cyclodextrin and oregano essential oil. All edible coatings, particularly 
CA-SA-MC, significantly (P ≤ 0.05) maintained firmness, total soluble solids, 
ascorbic acid content, and anthocyanin content compared with control treatment. 
This treatment also prevented browning and extended the shelf life of purple 
yam.
CONCLUSION: Oregano essential oil can be successfully encapsulated into 
cyclodextrin microcapsules. It has a great impact on the shelf life extension of 
purple yam and could be successfully applied to other fresh produce. © 2020

With the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the early 1970s, 
significant improvements in quality of life and life expectancy of persons with 
haemophilia (PWH) were realized. Unfortunately, as a result of transmission of 
HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) by contaminated concentrates in the 1980s, many 
of these gains were lost. Now with four decades of PWH unexposed to contaminated 
factor products and current treatments capable of suppressing and eliminating 
HIV and HCV, respectively, the survival rate is once again increasing. In 
addition to the usual comorbidities associated with advanced age in the general 
population, several specific issues occur in patients with bleeding disorders. 
This manuscript explores the incidence and management of the comorbidities of 
the ageing PWH with a focus on cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND: The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19). In Korea, as in other countries, the number of 
confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 have been rising. This study aimed to 
calculate the burden of disease due to COVID-19 in Korea.
METHODS: We used data on confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 between 
January 20 and April 24, 2020 provided by the Korea Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the local governments and the public media to determine 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by sex and age. Morbidity was estimated 
directly among the confirmed, cured, and fatal cases. Disability weights were 
adopted from previous similar causes on the severity of COVID-19 for the years 
of life lived with disability (YLDs). The years of life lost (YLLs) were 
calculated using the standard life expectancy from the 2018 life tables for each 
sex and age.
RESULTS: The YLDs were higher in females (155.2) than in males (105.1), but the 
YLLs were higher in males (1,274.3) than in females (996.4). The total disease 
burden attributable to COVID-19 in Korea during the study period, was estimated 
to be 2,531.0 DALYs, and 4.930 DALYs per 100,000 population. The YLDs and the 
YLLs constituted 10.3% and 89.7% of the total DALYs, respectively. The DALYs per 
100,000 population were highest in people aged ≥ 80 years, followed by those 
aged 70-79, 60-69, and 50-59 years, but the incidence was the highest in 
individuals aged 20-29 years.
CONCLUSION: This study provided the estimates of DALYs due to COVID-19 in Korea. 
Most of the disease burden from COVID-19 was derived from YLL; this indicates 
that decision-makers should focus and make an effort on reducing fatality for 
preparing the second wave of COVID-19.

Objectives: To estimate the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 
Moscow by investigating multiple sources of cases. Incidence rates from previous 
Russian studies ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 per 100,000/year. Methods: A 
retrospective study of the incidence of ALS was performed in the South district 
of Moscow (population, 1,760,000, 2015). Several data sources were investigated. 
The medical records of the calendar year 2015 were examined by an ALS expert who 
accepted only patients with definite or probable ALS according to the revised El 
Escorial criteria. Crude and standardized incidence rates were calculated, the 
latter adjusted to the Russian and the European population. Results: Twenty-two 
patients were found, accounting for a crude incidence of 1.25/100,000/year (95% 
CI 0.78-1.89) and a standardized incidence of 1.22 (Russia) and 1.28 (Europe). 
The sample included 11 men and 11 women aged 36-73 years (mean 56). Five 
patients (23%) had bulbar onset ALS. The mean diagnostic delay was 12.8 ± 9.2 
months (8.5 ± 4.8 in men and 17.2 ± 10.6 in women) (p = 0.02). Family history of 
ALS was present in two cases. Conclusion: The incidence of ALS in the Russian 
Federation is higher than previously reported but lower than in other countries. 
Poor diagnostic ascertainment, particularly in women, and the shorter life 
expectancy of the Russian population are possible explanations.

The case for extended lifespan in cooperatively breeding mammals: a 
re-appraisal.

Thorley J(1).

Author information:
(1)Large Animal Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, 
Cambridge, UK.

Recent comparative studies have suggested that cooperative breeding is 
associated with increases in maximum lifespan among mammals, replicating a 
pattern also seen in birds and insects. In this study, we re-examine the case 
for increased lifespan in mammalian cooperative breeders by analysing a large 
dataset of maximum longevity records. We did not find any consistent, strong 
evidence that cooperative breeders have longer lifespans than other mammals 
after having controlled for variation in body mass, mode of life and data 
quality. The only possible exception to this general trend is found in the 
African mole-rats (the Bathyergid family), where all members are relatively 
long-lived, but where the social, cooperatively breeding species appear to be 
much longer-lived than the solitary species. However, solitary mole-rat species 
have rarely been kept in captivity or followed longitudinally in the wild and so 
it seems likely that their maximum lifespan has been underestimated when 
compared to the highly researched social species. Although few subterranean 
mammals have received much attention in a captive or wild setting, current data 
instead supports a causal role of subterranean living on lifespan extension in 
mammals.

CONTEXT: Facial melanoses decreases the quality of life (QoL). Melasma is the 
commonest cause but there are various other etiologies for facial pigmentation.
AIMS: To study the clinical profile of patients with facial melanoses and the 
psychological burden in these patients.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: All patients having patchy or diffuse facial pigmentation 
attending the OPD in a tertiary care hospital for a period of 1 year were 
included in this hospital based cross-sectional study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The type, extent, and distribution of the pigmentation was 
noted and tabulated in all patients. All patients were explained about 
Skindex-16 questionnaire and asked to complete it.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Student t-test (two tailed, independent) was used to 
find the significance of study parameters on continuous scale between two 
groups. Chi-square/Fisher Exact test was used to find the significance of study 
parameters on categorical scale between two or more groups. Correlation was 
performed using Spearman corrélation.
RESULTS: The total number of cases studied was 238 of which 186 (78.2%) were 
females and 52 (21.8%) were males. The most common diagnosis was melasma seen in 
73% of cases. Other conditions noted were phototanning (5.8%), post-inflammatory 
hyperpigmentation (5.8%), Lichen planus pigmentosus (4.2%), freckles (3.7%), and 
Nevus of Ota (1.6%). Skindex-16 score against different grades of pigmentation 
showed that the mean Skindex-16 score was higher in severe cases but there was 
no statistically significant difference between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The extent and severity of facial pigmentation and the decrease in 
the QoL are not proportional.

An Extension of RE-AIM to Enhance Sustainability: Addressing Dynamic Context and 
Promoting Health Equity Over Time.

RE-AIM is a widely adopted, robust implementation science (IS) framework used to 
inform intervention and implementation design, planning, and evaluation, as well 
as to address short-term maintenance. In recent years, there has been growing 
focus on the longer-term sustainability of evidence-based programs, policies and 
practices (EBIs). In particular, investigators have conceptualized 
sustainability as the continued health impact and delivery of EBIs over a longer 
period of time (e.g., years after initial implementation) and incorporated the 
complex and evolving nature of context. We propose a reconsideration of RE-AIM 
to integrate recent conceptualizations of sustainability with a focus on 
addressing dynamic context and promoting health equity. In this Perspective, we 
present an extension of the RE-AIM framework to guide planning, 
measurement/evaluation, and adaptations focused on enhancing sustainability. We 
recommend consideration of: (1) extension of "maintenance" within RE-AIM to 
include recent conceptualizations of dynamic, longer-term intervention 
sustainability and "evolvability" across the life cycle of EBIs, including 
adaptation and potential de-implementation in light of changing and evolving 
evidence, contexts, and population needs; (2) iterative application of RE-AIM 
assessments to guide adaptations and enhance long-term sustainability; (3) 
explicit consideration of equity and cost as fundamental, driving forces that 
need to be addressed across RE-AIM dimensions to enhance sustainability; and (4) 
use or integration of RE-AIM with other existing frameworks that address key 
contextual factors and examine multi-level determinants of sustainability. 
Finally, we provide testable hypotheses and detailed research questions to 
inform future research in these areas.

PURPOSE: Low back pain (LBP) is a common ailment in most developed countries. 
Because most cases of LBP are known as 'non-specific', it has been challenging 
to develop experimental pain models of LBP which reproduce patients' clinical 
pain. In addition, previous models have limited applicability in a 
steady-pain-state neuroimaging environment. Thus, this study aims to devise a 
low back pain model with a simple methodology to induce experimental LBP, which 
has similar pain properties to patients' clinical pain, and to apply the model 
in a steady-pain-state neuroimaging study.
METHODS: Our low back extension (LBE) pain model was tested on 217 LBP patients 
outside the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to determine the 
reproducibility of endogenous pain and the similarity to their own clinical pain 
(STUDY1), and applied in a steady-pain-state functional MRI study (47 LBP 
patients and 23 healthy controls) to determine its applicability (induced head 
motions and brain functional connectivity changes; STUDY2).
RESULTS: By the LBE pain model, 68.2% of the LBP patients reported increased LBP 
with high similarity of sensations to their own clinical pain (STUDY1), and the 
head motions were statistically similar to and correlated with those in resting 
state (STUDY2). Furthermore, the LBE model altered brain functional connectivity 
by decreasing the default-mode and the sensorimotor networks, and increasing the 
salience network, which was significantly associated with the intensity of the 
induced pain. Conversely, the healthy controls showed increased somatosensory 
network (but not of the cognitive pain processing).
CONCLUSION: Our investigations suggest that our LBE pain model, which increased 
LBP with high similarity to the LBP patients' own pain sensation and induced 
patient-specific brain responses with acceptable head motion, could be applied 
to neuroimaging studies investigating brain responses to different levels of 
endogenous LBP.

We previously reported that chitinases reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe cell 
wall extension in a steady and continuous extension profile by cleaving chitins 
cross-linked to various polysaccahrides, whereas, endo-β-1,3-glucanases 
reconstituted heat-inactivated stipe wall extension in a profile of an initially 
fast extension and subsequent termination of extension due to its degradation of 
β-1,3-glucan but not other polysaccharides such as β-1,6-glucans cross-linked to 
chitins. Thus, a novel endo-β-1,6-glucanase, GH30A, from Coprinopsis cinerea was 
cloned and characterized to study cross-linking of β-1,6-glucan and wall 
extensibility in stipe walls. GH30A had higher activity and better 
thermophilicity than reported β-1,6-glucanases. GH30A hydrolyzed pustulan having 
β-1,6-linkages but not other polysaccharides without β-1,6-linkages; GH30A did 
not cleave gentiobiose and single β-1,6-linkage branches in laminarin from 
Laminaria digitata but cut consecutive β-1,6-linkage branches in laminarin from 
Eisenia bicyclis. GH30A reconstituted heated-inactivated stipe cell wall 
extension with release of glucose and gentiobiose, indicating that β-1,6-glucans 
were present and cross-linked to chitins in stipe walls, and cleaving 
β-1,6-glucans cross-linked to chitins by GH30A led to wall loosening for 
extension. However, GH30A individually or in combination with 
endo-β-1,3-glucanase reconstituted-stipe wall extension profile was similar to 
individual endo-β-1,3-glucanase's, exploring that chitins were also cross-linked 
to other polysaccharides besides β-1,3-glucans and β-1,6-glucans.

BACKGROUND: Elderly women with clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer (BC) 
often have comorbidities that limit life expectancy and complicate treatment. We 
sought to determine whether the number of lymph nodes (LNs) retrieved among 
older women with node-positive BC was associated with overall survival (OS).
METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database (2010-2015), women 70-90 y with 
cN + BC and ≥1 LNs removed were categorized by treatment sequence: upfront 
surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards models with restricted cubic splines characterized the functional 
association of LN retrieval with OS; threshold values of LN retrieval were 
estimated. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association 
of LN retrieval groups with OS.
RESULTS: In the upfront surgery cohort, a nonlinear association was identified 
between LNs retrieved and OS. In the NAC cohort, no association was identified. 
For the upfront surgery cohort, the optimal threshold value of LN retrieval was 
21 LNs (90% confidence interval 18-23). Based on this estimate, LN retrieval 
groups were created: <6, 6-11, 12-17, 18-23, and >23 LNs. After adjustment, 
retrieval of <12 LNs in the upfront surgery group was associated with a worse 
OS. No differences were observed in the NAC group.
CONCLUSIONS: For elderly women receiving upfront surgery, there is no survival 
benefit to removing more than 12 LNs, and for those receiving NAC, there is no 
association between number of LNs removed and survival. In older women who 
present with cN + BC, aggressive surgery to remove more than 12 LNs may not be 
necessary.

Treatment of oncologic patients has progressed greatly the last few years with 
the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs). These drugs are 
associated with the immune system and, thus, may cause side effects of immune 
origin, the so called immune related adverse events (irAEs). Immune related AEs 
may actually affect all organs and systems and frequently resemble clinical 
entities commonly encountered in clinical practice. As ICPIs have improved both 
quality of life and life expectancy, clinicians of various specialties may need 
to deal with irAEs in their everyday practice. Therefore, they should be able to 
recognize them timely and treat them accordingly. Herein, we review the 
pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and treatment of irAEs.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability and remains 
under-treated in nearly half of patients with cancer. The opioid crisis has 
highlighted an urgent public health need for effective nonpharmacological pain 
management. Electroacupuncture (EA) and Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) represent 
nonpharmacological modalities used in clinical practice to manage pain; however, 
their effectiveness has not been rigorously evaluated in oncology settings.
METHODS: We describe the design of a 3-arm, parallel, single-center, multisite 
randomized controlled trial that investigates EA and BFA versus usual-care 
wait-list control (WLC) for chronic musculoskeletal pain among 360 patients with 
diverse cancer types across various stages. The primary aim is to compare 
effects of EA and BFA versus WLC on pain, physical function, and co-morbid 
symptoms. The secondary aim is to examine the interaction between patient 
outcome expectancy and acupuncture modality (EA vs BFA) on pain reduction. The 
tertiary aim is to evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms and 
responses to acupuncture. Patients will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 
EA:BFA:WLC. Acupuncture groups will receive weekly treatments over 10 weeks. WLC 
will receive usual care over the same evaluation period as the acupuncture 
groups. The primary endpoint will be the change in average pain intensity score 
from baseline to week 12. We will collect validated patient-reported outcomes 
and blood/saliva samples at multiple timepoints over 24 weeks.
DISCUSSION: Our findings will advance nonpharmacological pain management in 
oncology and inform personalized treatment approaches that integrate 
individuals' expectations and genetic biomarkers to deliver "precision" 
acupuncture to cancer patients with chronic pain.

Punch grafting is a traditional technique used to promote epithelialization of 
hard-to-heal wounds. The main purpose of this observational study was to conduct 
a cost-utility analysis (CUA) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) comparing 
punch grafting (n = 46) with usual care (n = 34) for the treatment of chronic 
wounds in an outpatient specialized wound clinic from a public healthcare system 
perspective (Spanish National Health system) with a three-month time horizon. 
CUA outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated from EuroQoL-5D, 
whereas CEA outcome was wound-free period. One-way sensitivity analyses, extreme 
scenario analysis, and re-analysis by subgroups were conducted to fight against 
uncertainty. Bayesian regression models were built to explore whether 
differences between groups in costs, wound-free period, and QALYs could be 
explained by other variables different to treatment. As main results, punch 
grafting was associated with a reduction of 37% in costs compared to usual care, 
whereas mean incremental utility (0.02 ± 0.03 QALYs) and mean incremental 
effectiveness (7.18 ± 5.30 days free of wound) were favorable to punch grafting. 
All sensitivity analyses proved the robustness of our models. To conclude, punch 
grafting is the dominant alternative over usual care because it is cheaper and 
its utility and effectiveness are greater.

Lysosomes play important roles in cellular degradation to maintain cell 
homeostasis. In order to understand whether and how lysosomes alter with age and 
contribute to lifespan regulation, we characterized multiple properties of 
lysosomes during the aging process in C. elegans. We uncovered age-dependent 
alterations in lysosomal morphology, motility, acidity and degradation activity, 
all of which indicate a decline in lysosome function with age. The 
age-associated lysosomal changes are suppressed in the long-lived mutants daf-2, 
eat-2 and isp-1, which extend lifespan by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling, 
reducing food intake and impairing mitochondrial function, respectively. We 
found that 43 lysosome genes exhibit reduced expression with age, including 
genes encoding subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase and cathepsin proteases. The 
expression of lysosome genes is upregulated in the long-lived mutants, and this 
upregulation requires the functions of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 transcription 
factors. Impairing lysosome function affects clearance of aggregate-prone 
proteins and disrupts lifespan extension in daf-2, eat-2 and isp-1 worms. Our 
data indicate that lysosome function is modulated by multiple longevity pathways 
and is important for lifespan extension.

Lymphangioma is a rare and understudied pathology that is usually detected in 
the first decade of life, and its appearance in adults is rare. This report 
details a 51-year-old man with morbid obesity who presented, for the last eight 
months, multiple asymmetric tumor lesions with extension to the scrotal region. 
The diagnosis of circumscribed lymphangioma with associated infection was 
confirmed. This case report demonstrates an unusual presentation of the 
characteristics of the lymphangioma that are seldom described in the literature.

exergames training on muscular fitness in elderly women. J Strength Cond Res 
36(2): 427-432, 2022-To analyze the effects of 4 weeks of an active exergames 
training program on muscular fitness in older women, 2 groups of community 
dwelling physically active subjects were formed by block-design randomization. 
One was deemed the control group (CG, n = 37; age 68.1 ± 3.3 years), and a 
second group completed 4 weeks of an active exergames training program (ExG, n = 
35; age, 69.2 ± 3.7 years). Training included active exergames (Wii Fit Plus) 
performed on the Wii Balanceboard, 2 sessions per week. The exergames required 
mainly balance-related movements, such as leaning forward, leftward, and 
rightward, also requiring isometric squat positions and explosive leg extension. 
A supervisor-to-subject ratio method of 2:1 was used. An intensity-based 
individual progressive overload was applied. There were no significant (all p > 
0.05, d = 0.01-0.07) baseline differences between-groups for all dependent 
variables. For the ExG, significant improvements were observed in static balance 
right leg test (Δ75.5%, d = 0.89), static balance left leg (Δ33.7%, d = 0.57), 
timed up-and-go test (Δ14.8%, d = 0.85) and sit-to-stand velocity test (Δ83.8%, 
d = 1.62). For the control group, trivial to small decrements in performance 
were observed across all tests (Δ -2.1 to -8.4%, d = -0.08 to 0.32). Group × 
time interactions were observed for the static balance right and left leg, timed 
up-and-go test, and the mean velocity achieved in the 5-repetition sit-to-stand 
test (all p < 0.001; d = 0.33-0.60). In conclusion, exergames training improves 
muscular fitness in older women. These results should be considered when 
designing appropriate and better exercise training programs for older women.

Due to the aging population, the number of completely bedridden individuals is 
expected to increase, and such individuals are at high risk of developing 
urinary calculi. This retrospective study included 32 consecutive bedridden 
patients, who had undergone endoscopic lithotripsy between 2010 and 2019, and 
aimed to identify the treatment outcomes of endoscopic lithotripsy for bedridden 
patients. A total of 45 endoscopic lithotripsies were performed to treat stones 
(median cumulative diameter, 24 mm). The stone-free rate (SFR) < 4 mm and 
complete SFR (0 mm) were achieved in 81% and 63% of patients, respectively. 
Postoperatively, 10 patients (22%) developed symptoms of systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome, and three patients (7%) had bloodstream infections. Except 
for one patient (3%) having a retained ureteral stent ultimately died from 
septic shock, drainage tube-free discharge was achieved in all patients. The 
2-year cumulative incidence of stone-related events, and overall mortality rate, 
were 18% and 27%, respectively. Endoscopic lithotripsy is well tolerated and is 
associated with a high success rate, even with severe comorbidities and a 
relatively large stone burden. Physicians should consider performing endoscopic 
lithotripsy in bedridden patients with symptomatic urinary calculi regardless of 
their relatively short life expectancy and the remote risk of perioperative 
mortality.

Severely comminuted intraarticular distal radius malunion can significantly 
affect a patient's quality of life. To date, there is no ideal solution. We 
propose customized distal radius prosthesis replacement as a treatment option. A 
33-year-old policeman presented with left wrist deformity and loss of motion for 
five months following a distal radius fracture AO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für 
Osteosynthesefragen) type-C3 which had been fixed with a volar locking plate 
incorporate with external fixation and Kirschner wire (K-wire) augmentation for 
two months. He needed to rely on wrist motion for work. Therefore, we fabricated 
a customized distal radius prosthesis based on his contralateral normal anatomy 
to replace the malunion site. The patient was satisfied and able to return to 
work two months after the operation. Thirty months later, the range of motion 
had improved from fixed 40° flexion and fixed 70° pronation deformity to 73° 
flexion, 79° extension, 75° supination, and 85° pronation. His DASH 
(Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) score had improved from 80 to 
14.2. His pain score, as measured by the visual analog scale, improved from 
eight preoperatively to two. Unreconstructable intraarticular malunion of the 
distal radius is a challenging problem with no treatment consensus. Customized 
distal radius prosthesis may provide a successful treatment option. Future 
research should elucidate long-term outcomes.
