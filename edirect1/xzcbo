INTRODUCTION: The elderly population is growing driven by the increase in life 
expectancy, which in turn entails an increase in the number of people with 
chronic diseases such as dementia. The vast majority of people suffering from 
this illness is assisted by informal caregivers, who play a key role in 
fulfilling the patients&#8217; needs, promoting the possibility for people with 
dementia to live in their home environment. The Internet as a support tool in 
psychoeducational programs can significantly improve accessibility of them, 
becoming a currently consolidated interactive resource for the training of 
patients with acute and chronic diseases, and their caregivers.
POPULATION AND METHOD: A literature search of the Pubmed, PsyINFO, Scopus, 
SciELO and Psicodoc databases was performed to systematically review those 
studies related to web-based interventions for informal caregivers of people 
with dementia or cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: On balance, the studies show a significant improvement after the 
psychoeducational intervention. Specifically, the improvement in 
caregivers&#8217; wellbeing can be observed in the measures for self-efficacy, 
anxiety and depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Online interventions are a promising strategy for the care of 
people with dementia. It would be advisable to perform further randomized trials 
to assess the reasons for lack of adherence to intervention, as well as 
usability studies to test the different software programs used.

Survivors of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) have intense healthcare needs 
during acute and rehabilitation care and often through the rest of life. To 
prepare for a growing and aging population, simulation modeling was used to 
forecast the change in healthcare financial resources and long-term patient 
outcomes between 2012 and 2032. The model was developed with data from acute and 
rehabilitation care facilities across Canada participating in the Access to Care 
and Timing project. Future population and tSCI incidence for 2012 and 2032 were 
predicted with data from Statistics Canada and the Canadian Institute for Health 
Information. The projected tSCI incidence for 2012 was validated with actual 
data from the Rick Hansen SCI Registry of the participating facilities. Using a 
medium growth scenario, in 2032, the projected median age of persons with tSCI 
is 57 and persons 61 and older will account for 46% of injuries. Admissions to 
acute and rehabilitation facilities in 2032 were projected to increase by 31% 
and 25%, respectively. Because of the demographic shift to an older population, 
an increase in total population life expectancy with tSCI of 13% was observed 
despite a 22% increase in total life years lost to tSCI between 2012 and 2032. 
Care cost increased 54%, and rest of life cost increased 37% in 2032, 
translating to an additional CAD $16.4 million. With the demographics and 
management of tSCI changing with an aging population, accurate projections for 
the increased demand on resources will be critical for decision makers when 
planning the delivery of healthcare after tSCI.

The increased life expectancy, urbanization, and unhealthy lifestyle 
characterized by a shift towards a sedentary lifestyle and decreased energy 
expenditure are considered the main drivers of epidemiological transition. In 
particular, developing countries are facing a double burden caused by coexisting 
under- and over-nutrition, which causes a change in the disease profile from 
infectious diseases to a chronic degenerative pattern. This review discusses the 
under- and over-nutrition context in Mauritania and India, two countries that 
are experiencing a nutritional transition, and where we began a collaboration 
with local medical staff to integrate interventional and diagnostic guidelines. 
If many studies about diet and its relationship to non-communicable diseases are 
available for India, very few nutrition and cardiovascular risk studies have 
been conducted in Mauritania. Presently, with the exponential increase of 
nutrition-related diseases, targeted approaches are needed to provide balanced 
diets in parallel with the development of national preventive health systems and 
screening programs adapted to local needs. In this context, the measurement of 
oxidative stress biomarkers could be promising as an additive tool to assess 
cardiovascular (CV) risk in general population, and ameliorating prevention in 
patients at CV risk or with overt CV disease. Moreover, the possibility of 
improving the outcome by the direct employment of antioxidant remains plausible. 
Moreover, studies on the content of antioxidant in different foods may be 
helpful to develop a balanced diet, and achieve the maximal nutritional and 
functional properties of cultivars with benefits for human health.

Despite treatment guidelines recommending observation for men with low-risk 
prostate cancer with life expectancy <10 years, a majority of elderly patients 
choose active treatment, which may result in overtreatment. Given the growing 
burden of prostate cancer among men aged ≥80 years (super-elderly men), 
accumulation of survival data for evaluation of overtreatment among 
super-elderly patients is imperative. Here, we report results of a 
population-based cohort study to clarify potential overtreatment of 
super-elderly men with localized prostate cancer. We used cancer registry data 
from the Monitoring of Cancer Incidence in Japan project, which covers 47% of 
the Japanese population. The subjects were men diagnosed with prostate cancer 
between 2006 and 2008. Follow-up period was 5 years. We calculated 5-year 
relative survival rates among the active treatment and observation groups after 
imputation for missing values. Of the 48 782 patients with prostate cancer 
included in the analysis, 15.1% were super-elderly men. The 5-year relative 
survival rates of super-elderly men with localized cancer were 105.9% and 104.1% 
among the active treatment and observation groups, respectively. This excellent 
relative survival rate in the observation group remained consistent even after 
stratification by tumor grade. Of the 2963 super-elderly men with localized 
cancer, 252 (8.5%) with curative treatment and 1476 (49.8%) with hormone therapy 
were assumed to have been overtreated. The proportion of overtreatment was 
estimated to reach 80% after imputation. These specific survival data in 
super-elderly men in the observation group can be useful in shared 
decision-making for these patients and may lead to a reduction in overtreatment.

Oviposition preference and host suitability of the Mexican rice borer, Eoreuma 
loftini (Dyar) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), on bioenergy and conventional cultivars 
of sugarcane, Saccharum spp., and sorghum, Sorghum spp., were examined in a 
series of greenhouse experiments. Two energycane cultivars, two sugarcane 
cultivars, two high-biomass sorghum cultivars, and one sweet sorghum cultivar 
were assessed at two phenological stages (immature and mature). Mature plants 
possessed greater availability of dry leaf material compared with immature 
plants, and all E. loftini eggs were observed exclusively on dry leaves. 
Oviposition did not vary among host combinations (cultivar by phenological 
stage); however, eggs per plant and eggs per oviposition event were numerically 
greater on mature plants than immature plants. In a no-choice experiment, 
survival from egg to adult did not vary among host combinations, with <2.0% of 
E. loftini larvae surviving to adulthood. Failed establishment by neonates on 
plants was 13.4- to 53.9-fold greater than successful establishment across all 
host combinations. Results from this study suggest that plant physical 
characteristics continue to play an important role in host selection, but 
further evaluations will be needed to quantify other characteristics which 
influence host suitability.

BACKGROUND: To examine radiotherapy (RT) patterns-of-care and utilization at the 
end of life (EOL) among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain 
metastasis (BrM) in an integrated health care system.
METHODS: Central tumor registry identified 5,133 patients diagnosed with NSCLC 
from 2007-2011. BrM were determined by imaging. Patient and clinical 
characteristics were obtained by chart abstraction. In addition to abstracted 
variables, graded prognostic assessment (GPA) score of 0-1 was derived by 
collected data and tested as a predictor of death within 14 or 30 days of RT.
RESULTS: On NSCLC presentation, 10% harbored BrM while 7% developed BrM 
thereafter. Of 900 BrM patients, 15% were not referred for RT, with median time 
to death of 21 days. Median time to death for 5% not recommended RT was 48 days. 
Among those receiving brain RT, 11.9% died within 14 days and 23.3% 
(cumulatively) died within 30 days of treatment. Over 50% with GPA score 0-1 
received RT, 11% within 14 days and 21% within 30 days of death; median survival 
of GPA score 0-1 patients was 49 days. GPA score 0-1 independently predicted for 
death within 30 days of RT receipt.
CONCLUSIONS: BrM are common in NSCLC, and most patients are referred for brain 
RT. A surprising proportion of patients received treatment near the EOL, as 23% 
died within 30 days of RT. GPA score of 0-1 predicted for death within 30 days 
of treatment. RT referral, recommendation, and timing should be better tailored 
to life expectancy, and additional benchmarks for quality of care are needed.

Combination antiretroviral therapy promotes longer life expectancy, making it 
possible for perinatally HIV-infected patients to achieve adulthood. Past 
therapy was not always optimized, suggesting that virological and host features 
may also play a role in survival. The aim of this study is to describe 
characteristics of HIV disease progression associated with virological features 
in adolescents perinatally that were HIV infected. A case series was conducted 
including 81 patients that were in follow-up at Hospital de 
Clínicas/Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil. Venous blood was 
collected to conduct tropism and viral subtype assays. The median age was 19 
years old (interquartile range 18-21), and a majority of patients were female 
(54.3%). Viral subtype was obtained for 66 (82%) patients, and subtypes B and C 
were found in 34% and 59%, respectively. Tropism assay was conducted in 55 (67%) 
patients: 71% were R5 and 29% X4. Distribution of viral tropism and subtype 
shows a significant association of subtype C with R5 tropism. Subtype C is more 
prevalent in southern Brazil and also in the population infected with HIV by 
vertical transmission. Both R5 tropism and subtype C are associated with slower 
progression to AIDS. The survival of these patients may be related to 
virological features present in a benign pattern of disease progression.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) experience hip pain 
as well as decreased function and lowered quality of life. The aim was to 
compare maximal isometric and isokinetic muscle strength (MVC) during hip 
flexion and extension and rate of force development (RFD) during extension 
between patients with FAI and a matched reference group. Secondary, the aim was 
to compare patient hips and subgroups defined by gender and age as well as to 
investigate associations between hip muscle strength and self-reported outcomes. 
Design Cross-sectional, comparative study Methods Sixty patients (36±9 years, 
63% females) and 30 age and gender matched reference persons underwent MVC tests 
in an isokinetic dynamometer.
RESULTS: During hip flexion and extension, patients' affected hip showed a 
strength deficit of 15-21% (p<0.001) and 10-25% (p<0.03) compared with reference 
MVC, respectively. The affected hip of the patients was significantly weaker 
than their contralateral hip. RFD was significantly decreased for both patient 
hips compared to the reference group (p<0.05). While age had less effect on MVC, 
female patients were more affected than male patients. Self-reported measures 
were associated with isometric hip muscle strength.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FAI demonstrate decreased hip flexion and extension 
strength when compared to (1) reference persons and (2) their contralateral hip. 
There seems to be a gender specific affection which should be investigated 
further and addressed when planning training protocols. Furthermore, 
self-reported measures were associated with isometric muscle strength, which 
underlines the clinical importance of the reduced muscle strength.

Mucor and Rhizopus cause life-threatening infections primarily involving the 
lungs and sinuses, which disseminate very rapidly by necrosis and infarction of 
the contiguous tissues. We present a case of a 64-year-old African American 
posttransplant patient who presented with a productive cough and weight loss. He 
had a past surgical history of renal transplant for renal cell carcinoma and was 
on dual immunosuppressive therapy, that is, mycophenolate and tacrolimus. During 
his hospital stay, he developed a pneumopericardium due to the direct extension 
of a lung lesion. The diagnosis was made by radiological imaging and PCR result 
which was consistent with Mucor species. He was treated with antifungal therapy. 
The purpose of this report is to highlight the unusual association of 
mucormycosis with pneumopericardium.

Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma and the Importance of Considering the 
Oncogenic and Immune-Suppressant Role of the Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus 
Type 1: A Case Report.

INTRODUCTION: Soft-tissue sarcomas account for 0.7% of all malignant tumors, 
with an incidence rate of 3 per 100,000 persons/year. The undifferentiated 
pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) with giant cells, a high grade tumor of soft tissue, 
is very unusual, especially in young adults before the age of 40. Human T-cell 
lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus, classified as group 1 
human carcinogens by The International Agency for Research on Cancer, that 
causes an aggressive malignancy known as adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia and a 
progressive chronic inflammatory neurological disease named HTLV-1-associated 
myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 causes accumulation of 
genetic mutations in the host genome that could contribute to cellular 
transformation, one of the oncogenic features of HTLV-1.
CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a young woman with UPS who suffered from 
HAM/TSP with 3 years of evolution. In 2013, the patient started with 
neurological symptoms: weakness in the legs and bladder dysfunction. One year 
later, the patient developed a mild paraparesis in both extremities, anti-HTLV-1 
antibodies were detected in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid, and HAM/TSP was 
confirmed. In November 2015, a benign ganglion cyst was first suspected without 
intervention and by March 2016 a sarcoma was diagnosed. Three weeks after 
surgical resection, the tumor aroused in deep tissue and behaved aggressively, 
implicating a curative wide resection of the fibula, joint reconstruction, and 
soft-tissue graft. Histopathological examination confirmed UPS with giant cells.
CONCLUDING REMARKS: The unapparent subclinical immunodeficiency state due to 
HTLV-1 infection deserves to be considered in order to carefully monitor the 
possibility of developing any type of cancer. Besides, reaching an accurate and 
timely diagnosis of UPS can be challenging due to the difficulty in 
diagnosis/classification and delayed consultation. In this particular case, 
considering the high grade of UPS and the progressive invalidating myelopathy 
caused by HTLV-1, treatment should be carefully evaluated to positively impact 
on the patient's life expectancy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most countries test donations for HIV, HCV and HBV 
using serology with or without nucleic acid testing (NAT). Cost-utility analyses 
provide information on the relative value of different screening options. The 
aim of this project was to develop an open access risk assessment and 
cost-utility analysis web-tool for assessing HIV, HCV and HBV screening options 
(http://www.isbtweb.org/working-parties/transfusion-transmitted-infectious-diseases/). 
An analysis for six countries (Brazil, Ghana, the Netherlands, South Africa, 
Thailand and USA) was conducted.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four strategies; (1) antibody assays (Abs) for HIV and 
HCV + HBsAg, (2) antibody assays that include antigens for HIV and HCV (Combo) + 
HBsAg, (3) NAT in minipools of variable size (MP NAT) and (4) individual 
donation (ID) NAT can be evaluated using the tool. Country-specific data on 
donors, donation testing results, recipient outcomes and costs are entered using 
the online interface. Results obtained include the number infections interdicted 
using each screening options, and the (incremental and average) cost-utility of 
the options.
RESULTS: In each of the six countries evaluated, the use of antibody assays is 
cost effective or even cost saving. NAT has varying cost-utility depending on 
the setting, and where adopted, the incremental cost-utility exceeds any 
previously defined or proposed threshold in each country.
CONCLUSION: The web-tool allows an assessment of infectious units interdicted 
and value for money of different testing strategies. Regardless of gross 
national income (GNI) per capita, countries appear willing to dedicate 
healthcare resources to blood supply safety in excess of that for other sectors 
of health care.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative autosomal 
recessive disorder characterized by the loss of α-motor neurons. A variety of 
molecular pathways are being investigated to elevate SMN protein expression in 
SMA models and in the clinic. One of these approaches involves stabilizing the 
SMNΔ7 protein by inducing translational read-through. Previous studies have 
demonstrated that functionality and stability are partially restored to the 
otherwise unstable SMNΔ7 by the addition of non-specific C-terminal peptide 
sequences, or by inducing a similar molecular event through the use of 
read-through inducing compounds such as aminoglycosides.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the efficacy of the macrolide 
Azithromycin (AZM), an FDA approved read-through-inducing compound, in the 
well-established severe mouse model of SMA.
METHODS: Initially, dosing regimen following ICV administrations of AZM at 
different post-natal days and concentrations was determined by their impact on 
SMN levels in disease-relevant tissues. Selected dose was then tested for 
phenotypic parameters changes as compared to the appropriate controls and in 
conjugation to another therapy.
RESULTS: AZM increases SMN protein in disease relevant tissues, however, this 
did not translate into similar improvements in the SMA phenotype in a severe 
mouse model of SMA. Co-administration of AZM and a previously developed 
antisense oligonucleotide that increases SMN2 splicing, resulted in an 
improvement in the SMA phenotype beyond either AZM or ASO alone, including a 
highly significant extension in survival with improvement in body weight and 
movement.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to explore various approaches for SMA therapeutics, 
hence compounds that specifically induce SMNΔ7 read-through, without having 
prohibitive toxicity, may provide an alternative platform for a combinatorial 
treatment. Here we established that AZM activity at a low dose can increase SMN 
protein in disease-relevant animal model and can impact disease severity.

Objectives National quantifications of the health burden related to traffic 
noise are still rare. In this study, we use disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALY) measure to assess the burden of disease from road traffic and railway 
noise in Sweden. Methods The number of DALY was assessed for annoyance, sleep 
disturbance, hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke using a method 
previously implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO). Population 
exposure to noise was obtained from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency 
and the Swedish Transport Administration. Data on disease occurrence were 
gathered from registers held by the National Board of Health and Welfare and 
Statistics Sweden. Disability weights (DW) and duration were based on WHO 
definitions. Finally, we used research-based exposure-response functions or 
relative risks to estimate disease attributable to noise in each exposure 
category. Results The number of DALY attributed to traffic noise in Sweden was 
estimated to be 41 033 years; 36 711 (90%) related to road traffic and 4322 
(10%) related to railway traffic. The most important contributor to the disease 
burden was sleep disturbances, accounting for 22 218 DALY (54%), followed by 
annoyance, 12 090 DALY (30%), and cardiovascular diseases, 6725 DALY (16%). 
Conclusions Road traffic and railway noise contribute significantly to the 
burden of disease in Sweden each year. The total number of DALY should, however, 
be interpreted with caution due to limitations in data quality.

Land cover is one of the most important conditioning factors in landslide 
susceptibility analysis. Usually it is considered as a static factor, but it has 
proven to be dynamic, with changes occurring even in few decades. In this work 
the influence of land cover changes on landslide susceptibility are analyzed for 
the past and for future scenarios. For the application, an area representative 
of the hilly-low mountain sectors of the Italian Southern Apennines was chosen 
(Rivo basin, in Molise Region). With this purpose landslide inventories and land 
cover maps were produced for the years 1954, 1981 and 2007. Two alternative 
future scenarios were created for 2050, one which follows the past trend 
(2050-trend), and another one more extreme, foreseeing a decrease of forested 
and cultivated areas (2050-alternative). The landslide susceptibility analysis 
was performed using the Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation method for different 
time steps, investigating changes to susceptibility over time. The results show 
that environmental dynamics, such as land cover change, affect slope stability 
in time. In fact there is a decrease of susceptibility in the past and in the 
future 2050-trend scenario. This is due to the increase of forest or cultivated 
areas, that is probably determined by a better land management, water and soil 
control respect to other land cover types such as shrubland, pasture or 
bareland. Conversely the results revealed by the alternative scenario 
(2050-alternative), show how the decrease in forest and cultivated areas leads 
to an increase in landslide susceptibility. This can be related to the assumed 
worst climatic condition leading to a minor agricultural activity and lower 
extension of forested areas, possibly associated also to the effects of forest 
fires. The results suggest that conscious landscape management might contribute 
to determine a significant reduction in landslide susceptibility.

BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of vascular access referral for patients with 
chronic kidney disease who may need hemodialysis (HD) is a pressing question in 
nephrology. Current referral policies have not been rigorously compared with 
respect to costs and benefits and do not consider patient-specific factors such 
as age.
STUDY DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation model.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with chronic kidney disease, referred to a 
multidisciplinary kidney clinic in a universal health care system.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Cost-effectiveness analysis, payer perspective, 
lifetime horizon.
INTERVENTION: The following vascular access referral policies are considered: 
central venous catheter (CVC) only, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG) 
referral upon HD initiation, AVF (or AVG) referral when HD is forecast to begin 
within 12 (or 3 for AVG) months, AVF (or AVG) referral when estimated glomerular 
filtration rate is <15 (or <10 for AVG) mL/min/1.73m2.
OUTCOMES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, in 2014 US dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained).
RESULTS: The ICER of AVF (AVG) referral within 12 (3) months of forecasted HD 
initiation, compared to using only a CVC, is ∼$105k/QALY ($101k/QALY) at a 
population level (HD costs included). Pre-HD AVF or AVG referral dominates 
delaying referral until HD initiation. The ICER of pre-HD referral increases 
with patient age. Results are most sensitive to erythropoietin costs, ongoing HD 
costs, and patients' utilities for HD. When ongoing HD costs are excluded from 
the analysis, pre-HD AVF dominates both pre-HD AVG and CVC-only policies.
LIMITATIONS: Literature-based estimates for HD, AVF, and AVG utilities are 
limited.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of vascular access referral is largely 
driven by the annual costs of HD, erythropoietin costs, and access-specific 
utilities. Further research is needed in the field of dialysis-related quality 
of life to inform decision making regarding vascular access referral.

Advances in neuroimaging and its widespread use for screening have increased the 
diagnosis of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs), including small-sized 
UIAs. The clinical management of these small-sized UIAs requires a 
patient-specific judgment of the risk of aneurysm rupture, if not treated, 
versus the risk of complications from surgical or endovascular treatment. 
Experienced cerebrovascular teams recommend treating small UIAs in young 
patients or in patients with more than one aneurysm rupture risk factor who also 
have a reasonable life expectancy. However, individual overall assessment of 
risk is critical for patients with UIAs to decide the next steps of care.

This document updates the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations of 
the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), which represents 
the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological 
Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. CRC 
screening tests are ranked in 3 tiers based on performance features, costs, and 
practical considerations. The first-tier tests are colonoscopy every 10 years 
and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended 
as the cornerstones of screening regardless of how screening is offered. Thus, 
in a sequential approach based on colonoscopy offered first, FIT should be 
offered to patients who decline colonoscopy. Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended 
as tests of choice when multiple options are presented as alternatives. A 
risk-stratified approach is also appropriate, with FIT screening in populations 
with an estimated low prevalence of advanced neoplasia and colonoscopy screening 
in high prevalence populations. The second-tier tests include CT colonography 
every 5 years, the FIT-fecal DNA test every 3 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy 
every 5 to 10 years. These tests are appropriate screening tests, but each has 
disadvantages relative to the tier 1 tests. Because of limited evidence and 
current obstacles to use, capsule colonoscopy every 5 years is a third-tier 
test. We suggest that the Septin9 serum assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash) not 
be used for screening. Screening should begin at age 50 years in average-risk 
persons, except in African Americans in whom limited evidence supports screening 
at 45 years. CRC incidence is rising in persons under age 50, and thorough 
diagnostic evaluation of young persons with suspected colorectal bleeding is 
recommended. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when persons up 
to date with screening, who have prior negative screening (particularly 
colonoscopy), reach age 75 or have <10 years of life expectancy. Persons without 
prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85, depending on 
age and comorbidities. Persons with a family history of CRC or a documented 
advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative age <60 years or 2 first-degree 
relatives with these findings at any age are recommended to undergo screening by 
colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the 
youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier. Persons with a 
single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥60 years with CRC or an advanced 
adenoma can be offered average-risk screening options beginning at age 40 years.

Cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen species is believed to be a major 
contributor to age-associated diseases. Previously, we characterized the 
Caenorhabditis elegans Brap2 ortholog (BRAP-2) and found that it is required to 
prevent larval arrest in response to elevated levels of oxidative stress. Here, 
we report that C. elegans brap-2 mutants display increased expression of 
SKN-1-dependent, phase II detoxification enzymes that is dependent on PMK-1 (a 
p38 MAPK C. elegans ortholog). An RNA-interference screen was conducted using a 
transcription factor library to identify genes required for increased expression 
of the SKN-1 target gst-4 in brap-2 mutants. We identified ELT-3, a member of 
the GATA transcription factor family, as a positive regulator of gst-4p::gfp 
expression. We found that ELT-3 interacts with SKN-1 to activate gst-4 
transcription in vitro and that elt-3 is required for enhanced gst-4 expression 
in the brap-2(ok1492) mutant in vivo Furthermore, nematodes overexpressing SKN-1 
required ELT-3 for life-span extension. Taken together, these results suggest a 
model where BRAP-2 acts as negative regulator of SKN-1 through inhibition of p38 
MAPK activity, and that the GATA transcription factor ELT-3 is required along 
with SKN-1 for the phase II detoxification response in C. elegans.

The incidence of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) is on the rise in the UK. 
Patients with NETs need to be managed by a team of clinical specialties. There 
are a number of challenging gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations related to NETs 
that can occur in these patients, but a limited literature base exists to guide 
clinicians.Whilst life expectancy can be several years for patients with NETs, 
the GI symptoms can have a significant impact on their quality of life. It is 
therefore imperative to be familiar with the common GI manifestations associated 
with NETs, so symptoms can be appropriately managed with an overall aim of 
restoring the patient's quality of life.

Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) knockout (KO) mice, generated 
through homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, have a significantly 
increased lifespan compared to wild-type littermates. However, it is unknown 
whether this longevity advantage would pertain to PAPP-A gene deletion in adult 
animals. In the present study, we used tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible Cre 
recombinase-mediated excision of the floxed PAPP-A (fPAPP-A) gene in mice at 
5 months of age. fPAPP-A mice, which were either positive (pos) or negative 
(neg) for Tam-Cre, received Tam treatment with quarterly boosters. Only female 
mice could be used with this experimental design. fPAPP-A/neg and fPAPP-A/pos 
mice had similar weights at the start of the experiment and showed equivalent 
weight gain. We found that fPAPP-A/pos mice had a significant extension of life 
span (P = 0.005). The median life span was increased by 21% for fPAPP-A/pos 
compared to fPAPP-A/neg mice. Analysis of mortality in life span quartiles 
indicated that the proportion of deaths of fPAPP-A/pos mice were lower than 
fPAPP-A/neg mice at young adult ages (P = 0.002 for 601-800 days) and higher 
than fPAPP-A/neg mice at older ages (P = 0.004 for >1000 days). Thus, survival 
curves and age-specific mortality indicate that female mice with knockdown of 
PAPP-A gene expression as adults have an extended healthy life span.

BACKGROUND: The available literature on the use of a cementless total elbow 
arthroplasty (TEA) design and its results are limited. This clinical study 
reports the outcome of the cementless Discovery elbow system.
METHODS: Patients were operated on by a single surgeon between 2007 and 2014. 
Nineteen patients (20 elbows) were available for review, 2 women (1 bilateral 
TEA) and 17 men. The age of the patients ranged from 27 to 75 years (mean, 48 
years). The mean follow-up was 61.8 months (range, 12-156 months). Patients were 
assessed for range of motion, pain, and satisfaction level. Outcome scores 
included the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, the Liverpool Elbow Score, and the 
12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 1). Radiographs were reviewed to 
evaluate for loosening.
RESULTS: The mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 77.25, and the mean Liverpool 
Elbow Score was 6.76. The mean flexion range was 123°, and the mean extension 
lag was 35°. The mean pronation was 59°, and the mean supination was 58°. On 
radiologic evaluation, there were no signs of loosening; however, in 2 cases, 
nonprogressive radiolucent lines were observed. No signs of infection were 
detected at final follow-up, and no elbows were revised. More than 90% of 
patients were satisfied with the overall outcome.
