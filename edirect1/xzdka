Understanding the influence of individual attributes on demographic processes is 
a key objective of wildlife population studies. Capture-recapture and age data 
are commonly collected to investigate hypotheses about survival, reproduction, 
and viability. We present a novel age-structured Jolly-Seber model that 
incorporates age and capture-recapture data to provide comprehensive information 
on population dynamics, including abundance, age-dependent survival, 
recruitment, age structure, and population growth rates. We applied our model to 
a multi-year capture-recapture study of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western 
Hudson Bay, Canada (2012-2018), where management and conservation require a 
detailed understanding of how polar bears respond to climate change and other 
factors. In simulation studies, the age-structured Jolly-Seber model improved 
precision of survival, recruitment, and annual abundance estimates relative to 
standard Jolly-Seber models that omit age information. Furthermore, 
incorporating age information improved precision of population growth rates, 
increased power to detect trends in abundance, and allowed direct estimation of 
age-dependent survival and changes in annual age structure. Our case study 
provided detailed evidence for senescence in polar bear survival. Median 
survival estimates were lower (<0.95) for individuals aged <5 years, remained 
high (>0.95) for individuals aged 7-22 years, and subsequently declined to near 
zero for individuals >30 years. We also detected cascading effects of large 
recruitment classes on population age structure, which created major shifts in 
age structure when these classes entered the population and then again when they 
reached prime breeding ages (10-15 years old). Overall, age-structured 
Jolly-Seber models provide a flexible means to investigate ecological and 
evolutionary processes that shape populations (e.g., via senescence, life 
expectancy, and lifetime reproductive success) while improving our ability to 
investigate population dynamics and forecast population changes from 
capture-recapture data.

Sex-Specific Effects of Stress on Respiratory Control: Plasticity, Adaptation, 
and Dysfunction.

Canada.

As our understanding of respiratory control evolves, we appreciate how the basic 
neurobiological principles of plasticity discovered in other systems shape the 
development and function of the respiratory control system. While breathing is a 
robust homeostatic function, there is growing evidence that stress disrupts 
respiratory control in ways that predispose to disease. Neonatal stress (in the 
form of maternal separation) affects "classical" respiratory control structures 
such as the peripheral O2 sensors (carotid bodies) and the medulla (e.g., 
nucleus of the solitary tract). Furthermore, early life stress disrupts the 
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), a structure that has emerged 
as a primary determinant of the intensity of the ventilatory response to 
hypoxia. Although underestimated, the PVH's influence on respiratory function is 
a logical extension of the hypothalamic control of metabolic demand and supply. 
In this article, we review the functional and anatomical links between the 
stress neuroendocrine axis and the medullary network regulating breathing. We 
then present the persistent and sex-specific effects of neonatal stress on 
respiratory control in adult rats. The similarities between the respiratory 
phenotype of stressed rats and clinical manifestations of respiratory control 
disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing and panic attacks are remarkable. 
These observations are in line with the scientific consensus that the origins of 
adult disease are often found among developmental and biological disruptions 
occurring during early life. These observations bring a different perspective on 
the structural hierarchy of respiratory homeostasis and point to new directions 
in our understanding of the etiology of respiratory control disorders. © 2021

BACKGROUND: Barth Syndrome (BTHS) is a rare genetic disorder that presents as a 
complex of debilitating symptoms and reduced life expectancy. Well-developed, 
BTHS-specific assessments measuring primary signs and symptoms of BTHS are not 
currently available, making it difficult to evaluate treatment effects in BTHS 
clinical studies. The objective of this research was to develop symptom-focused 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for use in clinical studies with 
adolescents and adults with BTHS.
METHODS: Concept elicitation interviews (CEIs) with pediatric (n = 18, 
age < 16 years) and adult (n = 15, age ≥ 16 years) individuals with BTHS and/or 
their caregivers were conducted to identify signs and symptoms relevant to BTHS 
and important to individuals with the condition. Based on CEI results, 
questionnaire construction activities were conducted to create unique adolescent 
and adult versions of the Barth Syndrome-Symptom Assessment (BTHS-SA). The 
questionnaires were evaluated in cognitive debriefing interviews (CDIs) with 
adolescents (n = 12; age 12- < 16 years) and adults (n = 12; age ≥ 16 years) 
with BTHS to assess relevance and readability of the tools.
RESULTS: During the CEIs, a total of 48 and 40 signs and symptoms were reported 
by the pediatric and adult groups, respectively; 31 were reported by both age 
groups. Fatigue/tiredness and muscle weakness were the symptoms most frequently 
reported by both pediatric and adult patients with BTHS as important to improve 
with an effective treatment. The CEI results informed construction of a 
nine-item version of the BTHS-SA for adolescents and an eight-item version for 
adults. Developed for daily administration, each version asks respondents to 
rate symptom severity "at its worst" over the 24 h prior to administration. CDIs 
with both adolescents and adults with BTHS demonstrated that each BTHS-SA 
version was reflective of the disease experience and that respondents could 
interpret the questionnaire as intended and provide responses that accurately 
reflected their symptom experience.
CONCLUSIONS: The BTHS-SA adolescent and adult versions are content-valid PRO 
measures that can be used to evaluate severity of disease-specific symptoms in 
future clinical trials. Given the lack of available and well-developed 
assessments in this underserved therapeutic area, these tools fulfill a need for 
clinical researchers developing treatments for individuals with BTHS.

BACKGROUND: Accurate appraisal of burden of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) 
cancers is crucial to informing resource allocation and policy making. We report 
on the latest estimates of burden of AYA cancers in 204 countries and 
territories between 1990 and 2019 in association with socio-demographic index 
(SDI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Estimates from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019 
were used to analyse incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) due to AYA cancers at global, regional, and national levels by sex. 
Association between AYA cancer burden and SDI were investigated. Burdens of AYA 
cancers were contextualized in comparison with childhood and older adult 
cancers. All estimates are reported as counts and age-standardized rates per 
100,000 person-years.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 1.2 million incident cases, 0.4 million deaths, and 
23.5 million DALYs due to AYA cancers globally. The highest age-standardized 
incidence rate occurred in Western Europe (75.3 [Females] and 67.4 [Males] per 
100,000 person-years). Age-standardized death (23.2 [Females] and 13.9 [Males] 
per 100,000 person-years) and DALY (1328.3 [Females] and 1059.2 [Males] per 
100,000 person-years) rates were highest in Oceania. Increasing SDI was 
associated with a higher age-standardized incidence rate. An inverted U-shaped 
association was identified between SDI and death and DALY rates. AYA cancers 
collectively is the second leading cause of non-communicable diseases-related 
deaths globally in 2019. DALYs of AYA cancers ranked the second globally and the 
first in low and low-middle SDI locations when compared with that of childhood 
and older adult cancers.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of AYA cancers is substantial and 
disproportionally affect populations in limited-resource settings. Capacity 
building for AYA cancers is essential in promoting equity and population health 
worldwide.

The scarcity of medical resources is widely recognized, and therefore priority 
setting is inevitable. This study examines whether Portuguese healthcare 
professionals (physicians vs nurses): (i) share the moral guidance proposed by 
ethicists and (ii) attitudes toward prioritization criteria vary among 
individual and professional characteristics. A sample of 254 healthcare 
professionals were confronted with hypothetical prioritization scenarios 
involving two patients distinguished by personal or health characteristics. 
Descriptive statistics and parametric analyses were performed to evaluate and 
compare the adherence of both groups of healthcare professionals regarding 10 
rationing criteria: waiting time, treatment prognosis measured in life 
expectancy and quality of life, severity of health conditions measured in pain 
and immediate risk of dying, age discrimination measured in favoring the young 
over older and favoring the youngest over the young, merit evaluated positively 
or negatively, and parenthood. The findings show a slight adherence to the 
criteria. Waiting time and patient pain were the conditions considered fairer by 
respondents in contrast with the ethicists normative. Preferences for 
distributive justice vary by professional group and among participants with 
different political orientations, rationing experience, years of experience, and 
level of satisfaction with the NHS. Decision-makers should consider the opinion 
of ethicists, but also those of healthcare professionals to legitimize explicit 
guidelines.

Low-dose computed tomography screening can be used to diagnose lung cancer at a 
younger age compared to no screening. Real-world studies observing mortality 
after lung cancer diagnosis are subject to lead-time bias. This study developed 
a method using a nationwide cancer registry and stage shift from trial for the 
adjustment of lead-time bias. 78,897 Taiwanese nationwide lung cancer patients 
aged 55-82 were matched with 788,820 referents randomly selected from the 
general population at a ratio of 1:10 by age, sex, calendar year, and 
comorbidities, to estimate the pathology- and stage-specific life expectancy 
(LE). Loss-of-LE is the difference between the LE of cancer patients and that of 
referents. By multiplying LE and loss-of-LE by the pathology and stage shift in 
the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), we compared the effectiveness of 
cancer screening measured by LE gained and loss-of-LE saved. The mean LEs of 
stage IA and IV adenocarcinoma were 14.5 and 1.9 years, respectively, indicating 
a LE gain of 12.6 years. However, the mean loss-of-LEs of stage IA and IV 
adenocarcinoma were 3.7 and 15.1 years, respectively, with a saving of only 
11.4 years, implying an adjustment of different distributions of age, sex, and 
calendar year of diagnosis from stage shift and a reduction in lead-time bias. 
Applying such estimations on the results of 10,000 participants with the same 
pathology and stage shift in the NLST, the benefit of screening using LE gained 
would be 410.3 (95% prediction interval: 328.4 to 503.3) years. It became 297.1 
(95% prediction interval: 187.8 to 396.4) years when using loss-of-LE saved, 
indicating the former approach would overestimate the effectiveness by 38%. Our 
approach of multiplying loss-of-LE by pathology and stage shift to estimate 
loss-of-LE saved could adjust for different distributions of age, sex, and 
calendar year at early diagnosis and reduce lead-time bias.

BACKGROUND: Expectant management (EM) has been widely recommended for men with 
low-risk prostate cancers (PCa). We evaluated trends in EM and the 
sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with EM, initiating a National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-concordant active surveillance (AS) 
monitoring protocol, and switching from EM to active treatment (AT).
METHODS: We used the SEER-Medicare database to identify men ages 66+ diagnosed 
with a low-risk PCa (PSA < 10 ng/mL, Gleason ≤ 6, stage ≤ T2a) in 2010-2013 with 
≥1 year of follow-up. We used claims data to capture (1) PCa treatments, 
including surgical procedures, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy, and (2) AS 
monitoring procedures, including PSA tests and prostate biopsy. We defined EM as 
receiving no AT within 1 year of diagnosis. We used multivariable regression 
techniques to identify factors associated with EM, initiating AS monitoring, and 
switching to AT.
RESULTS: During the study period, EM increased from 29.4% to 49.0%, p < 0.01. 
Age < 77, being married/partnered, non-Hispanic ethnicity, higher median ZIP 
code income, lower PSA levels, stage T1c, and more recent year of diagnosis were 
associated with EM. Nearly 39% of the EM cohort initiated AS monitoring; age 
<77, White race, being married/partnered, higher median ZIP code income, and 
lower PSA levels were associated with initiating AS. By three years after 
diagnosis, 21.3% of the EM cohort had switched to AT, usually after undergoing 
AS monitoring procedures.
DISCUSSION: We found increasing uptake of EM over time, though over 50% still 
received AT. About 60% of EM patients did not initiate AS monitoring, even among 
those with life expectancy >10 years, implying that a substantial proportion was 
being managed by watchful waiting. AS monitoring was associated with switching 
to AT, suggesting that treatment decisions likely were based on cancer 
progression.

Background: The pneumococcal vaccine has been considered as the most effective 
measure to prevent pneumococcal diseases. In 2013, Shanghai launched a major 
public health program to vaccinate people aged 60 years or older with 23-Valent 
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPSV-23) free of charge. By the end of June 
2020, a total of 1.56 million old people had been vaccinated free of charge. 
Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PPSV-23 vaccination program in 
Shanghai from the health system perspective. Methods: According to the actual 
number of people aged 60 years or older with PPSV-23 vaccination in Shanghai 
from 2013 to 2018, a multi-cohort Markov model for life-time was developed to 
compare health and economic outcomes of vaccinated people vs. if they were not 
vaccinated for PPSV-23. Cost effectiveness was reported as incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER). A 5% discount rate was used for both costs and 
health outcomes. In addition, one-way sensitivity analysis was used to test the 
model's robustness. Results: By the end of 2018, a total of 1,091,967 people 
aged 60 years or older were vaccinated with PPSV-23 in Shanghai, China. 
Comparing with the unvaccinated circumstances, PPSV-23 vaccination would cost US 
$19.62 million more and receive an additional 10,321.3 quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). PPSV-23 was associated with the ICER of $190.1 per QALY 
gained. The Results were sensitive to the variation of vaccine effectiveness 
against community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and disease incidence, mortality, 
and costs of CAP. In all sensitivity analysis, the PPSV-23 was economical. 
Conclusion: The PPSV-23 vaccination program in Shanghai was cost-effective. With 
the further development of the project, the administrative costs of the vaccine 
will be reduced, making it more cost-effective.

Community-Based Livestock Breeding: Coordinated Action or Relational Process?

Over the past decade, community-based breeding programs (CBBPs) have been 
promoted as a viable approach to improving smallholder livelihoods through a 
systematic livestock breeding. CBBPs aim to initiate systematic breeding at the 
community level, including an organized animal identification and recording of 
performance and pedigree data. To ensure the breeding programs' continuity, 
building capacities, and ownership among participants are essential to the 
approach. This study's purpose was to understand how CBBPs have evolved in 
specific institutional settings and which dynamics occur in the course of 
implementation. We addressed these questions in reflective conversations with 
six coordinators of a diverse sample of CBBPs: goats (Malawi, Uganda, and 
Mexico), sheep (Ethiopia), alpaca (Peru), and cattle (Burkina Faso). The 
interviews and analysis were guided by categories of the multi-level 
perspective. The respondents considered lack of funding and weak 
institutionalization as the main constraints on the CBBPs. While the idea of 
participation and localized ownership was at the center of the programs, linear 
paradigms of knowledge transfer prevailed. In all cases, the impulse to start a 
CBBP came from individual researchers, who relied on intermediaries, such as 
extension agents, for implementation. Personal relations and trust were seen as 
both a factor in the success and a positive outcome of CBBPs. We conclude that 
these findings have different implications depending on how rural development is 
conceptualized: proponents of the innovation systems perspective would call for 
stakeholders to further align their interests and coordinate their actions. 
Proponents of process-relational concepts, in contrast, would not consider the 
CBBP a product but a starting-point for initiators and participants to 
continuously discover new ways of collaboration and engagement.

The short half-life of coagulation factor IX (FIX) for haemophilia B (HB) 
therapy has been prolonged through fusion with human serum albumin (HSA), which 
drives the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling of the chimera. 
However, patients would greatly benefit from further FIX-HSA half-life 
extension. In the present study, we designed a FIX-HSA variant through the 
engineering of both fusion partners. First, we developed a novel cleavable 
linker combining the two FIX activation sites, which resulted in improved HSA 
release. Second, insertion of the FIX R338L (Padua) substitution conferred 
hyperactive features (sevenfold higher specific activity) as for FIX Padua 
alone. Furthermore, we exploited an engineered HSA (QMP), which conferred 
enhanced human (h)FcRn binding [dissociation constant (KD ) 0·5 nM] over 
wild-type FIX-HSA (KD 164·4 nM). In hFcRn transgenic mice, Padua-QMP displayed a 
significantly prolonged half-life (2·7 days, P < 0·0001) versus FIX-HSA (1 day). 
Overall, we developed a novel FIX-HSA protein with improved activity and 
extended half-life. These combined properties may result in a prolonged 
functional profile above the therapeutic threshold, and thus in a potentially 
widened therapeutic window able to improve HB therapy. This rational engineering 
of both partners may pave the way for new fusion strategies for the design of 
engineered biotherapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a clinical status and a progressive 
health disorder extremely related to increased morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess systematic review of 
literature on cost-effectiveness done in patients with heart failure receiving 
Ivabradine plus standard treatment compared with standard treatment alone.
AREAS COVERED: This study is a systematic review in which all published articles 
related to the study topic were assessed in time range of 2014-2020. In order to 
find articles, internet search in foreign databases of PubMed, Embase, ISI/Web 
of Science (WoS), SCOPUS, Global Health databases, through keywords related to 
the objective was performed. Six articles out of 1524 article related to final 
topic were assessed. In addition, quality of studies was evaluated using CHEERS 
checklist. In six countries investigated (Iran, Thailand, Australia, United 
States of America, United Kingdom, and Greece), willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
thresholds higher cost per QALY, and highest ICER for Ivabradine was in USA 
(55,600 $/QALY) and the lowest was in Thailand (10,616$/QALY). Most items of 
CHEERS were estimated in the studies and studies had good quality.
EXPERT OPINION: Regarding our investigation, ivabradine combined with standard 
care was more cost-effective than standard care alone in most of the evaluated 
studies, although the cost of this intervention was higher than its 
effectiveness. However, the threshold chosen by each country can have a 
significant impact on these results. And to have a more accurate result, it is 
required to pay more attention to the income level in different countries.

Evidence from theories of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) 
suggests that experiencing adverse early life conditions subsequently leads to 
detrimental adult health outcomes. The bulk of empirical DOHaD literature does 
not consider the nature and magnitude of the impact of adverse early life 
conditions at the population level. In particular, it ignores the distortion of 
age and cohort patterns of adult health and mortality and the increased load of 
chronic illness and disability that ensues. In this paper, we use a 
microsimulation model combined with empirical estimates of incidence and 
prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and associated disability in low- and 
middle-income countries to assess the magnitude of delayed effects on adult 
healthy life expectancy and on compression (or expansion) of morbidity at older 
ages. The main goal is to determine if, in what ways, and to what extent delayed 
effects due to early conditions can influence cohorts' chronic illness and 
disability profiles.

In diploid cells, the paternal and maternal alleles are, on average, equally 
expressed. There are exceptions from this: a small number of genes express the 
maternal or paternal allele copy exclusively. This phenomenon, known as genomic 
imprinting, is common among eutherian mammals and some plant species; however, 
genomic imprinting in species with haplodiploid sex determination is not well 
characterized. Previous work reported no parent-of-origin effects in the hybrids 
of closely related haplodiploid Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti jewel 
wasps, suggesting a lack of epigenetic reprogramming during embryogenesis in 
these species. Here, we replicate the gene expression dataset and observations 
using different individuals and sequencing technology, as well as reproduce 
these findings using the previously published RNA sequence data following our 
data analysis strategy. The major difference from the previous dataset is that 
they used an introgression strain as one of the parents and we found several 
loci that resisted introgression in that strain. Our results from both datasets 
demonstrate a species-of-origin effect, rather than a parent-of-origin effect. 
We present a reproducible workflow that others may use for replicating the 
results. Overall, we reproduced the original report of no parent-of-origin 
effects in the haplodiploid Nasonia using the original data with our new 
processing and analysis pipeline and replicated these results with our newly 
generated data.

BACKGROUND: Sleep is essential for full mental and physical renewal. Cardiac 
surgery improves the life expectancy and quality. But unfortunately, some 
patients lacked that merit as they suffered sleep disturbance. We used validated 
questionnaire applied to 153 cardiac surgery patients to assess the sleep 
disturbances after surgery.
RESULTS: About 70 (45.8%) had valve procedure, 55 (36%) had revascularization, 
19 (12.4%) had both procedures and 9 (5.8%) had other procedures. The majority 
had no post-operative bleeding nor infection. About 78% had sleeping difficulty 
for one month. About 50% used different medications to fall asleep, mostly 
analgesics. About 76% slept after 2-6 h irrespective of sleep quality. Some 
patients had poor sleep quality in the form of nightmares and night terrors.
CONCLUSION: Sleep quality was disturbed immediately following cardiac surgery. 
There was a reduction of night sleep compensated by increased daytime 
sleepiness. These changes almost reverted one month after surgery.

family care-givers.

BACKGROUND: In Israel, caring for people with end-stage dementia confined to 
home is mainly done by home care units, and in some cases by home hospice units, 
an alternative palliative-care service. Because life expectancy is relatively 
unknown, and the patient's decision-making ability is poor, caring for this 
unique population raises ethical dilemmas regarding when to define the disease 
as having reached a terminal stage, as well as choosing between palliative and 
life-prolonging-oriented care.
OBJECTIVES: Exploring and describing differences and similarities of 
professional staff members' (PSMs') and family caregivers' perceptions of caring 
for people with end-stage dementia in two different settings.
DESIGN: Qualitative research, using semi-structured interviews analyzed through 
a thematic content-analysis approach.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four interviews were conducted (24 PSMs and 40 family 
caregivers) in two care-settings-home hospice unit and home care unit.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee 
(BBL00118-17).
FINDINGS: We found dilemmas regarding palliative care to be the main theme, 
including definition of the disease as terminal, choosing "comfort" over 
"life-prolonging," clarifying patients' wishes and deciding whether or not to 
use artificial feeding.
DISCUSSION: Both PSMs and family caregivers deal with ethical dilemmas and have 
reached different conclusions, both legitimate. Comprehending dementia as a 
terminal disease influenced participants' perceptions of the relevancy of 
palliative care for people with end-stage dementia. Discrepancies between PSMs 
and family caregivers in caring for people with end-stage dementia were found in 
both home hospice unit and home care unit environments, raising potential 
conflicts regarding decisions for end-of-life care.
CONCLUSIONS: Communication between PSMs and family caregivers is crucial for the 
discussion about the discrepancies regarding the unique dilemmas of caring for 
people with end-stage dementia and bridging the gap between them. Lack of 
communication and resources can hamper the provision of an acceptable solution 
for quality and equality of care in the best interest of people with end-stage 
dementia.

BACKGROUND: Currently biomarkers play an essential role in diagnosis, treatment, 
and management of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) determination of 
biomarkers such as ALK, EGFR, ROS1 or PD-L1 is mandatory for an adequate 
treatment decision. The aim of this study is to determine the clinical and 
economic impact of current anaplastic lymphoma kinase testing scenario in Spain.
METHODS: A joint model, composed by decision-tree and Markov models, was 
developed to estimate the long-term health outcomes and costs of NSCLC patients, 
by comparing the current testing scenario for ALK in Spain vs a hypothetical 
no-testing. The current distribution of testing strategies for ALK determination 
and their sensitivity and specificity data were obtained from the literature. 
Treatment allocation based on the molecular testing result were defined by a 
panel of Spanish experts. To assess long-term effects of each treatment, 
3-states Markov models were developed, where progression-free survival and 
overall survival curves were extrapolated using exponential models. Medical 
direct costs (expressed in €, 2019) were included. A lifetime horizon was used 
and a discount rate of 3% was applied for both costs and health effects. Several 
sensitivity analyses, both deterministic and probabilistic, were performed in 
order test the robustness of the analysis.
RESULTS: We estimated a target population of 7628 NSCLC patients, including 
those with non-squamous histology and those with squamous carcinomas who were 
never smokers. Over the lifetime horizon, the current ALK testing scenario 
produced additional 5060 and 3906 life-years and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALY), respectively, compared with the no-testing scenario. Total direct costs 
were increased up to € 51,319,053 for testing scenario. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was 10,142 €/QALY. The sensitivity analyses carried out 
confirmed the robustness of the base-case results, being the treatment 
allocation and the test accuracy (sensitivity and specificity data) the key 
drivers of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: ALK testing in advanced NSCLC patients, non-squamous and 
never-smoker squamous, provides more than 3000 QALYs in Spain over a lifetime 
horizon. Comparing this gain in health outcomes with the incremental costs, the 
resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio reinforces that testing 
non-squamous and never-smoker squamous NSCLC is a cost-effective strategy in 
Spain.

The relative importance and stability of disease burden causes over time: 
summarizing regional trends on disease burden for 290 causes over 28 years.

BACKGROUND: Since the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) has become more 
comprehensive, data for hundreds of causes of disease burden, measured using 
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), have become increasingly available for 
almost every part of the world. However, undergoing any systematic comparative 
analysis of the trends can be challenging given the quantity of data that must 
be presented.
METHODS: We use the GBD data to describe trends in cause-specific DALY rates for 
eight regions. We quantify the extent to which the importance of 'major' DALY 
causes changes relative to 'minor' DALY causes over time by decomposing changes 
in the Gini coefficient into 'proportionality' and 'reranking' indices.
RESULTS: The fall in regional DALY rates since 1990 has been accompanied by 
generally positive proportionality indices and reranking indices of negligible 
magnitude. However, the rate at which DALY rates have been falling has slowed 
and, at the same time, proportionality indices have tended towards zero. These 
findings are clearest where the focus is exclusively upon non-communicable 
diseases. Notably, large and positive proportionality indices are recorded for 
sub-Saharan Africa over the last decade.
CONCLUSION: The positive proportionality indices show that disease burden has 
become less concentrated around the leading causes over time, and this trend has 
become less prominent as the DALY rate decline has slowed. The recent decline in 
disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionally driven by improvements 
in DALY rates for HIV/AIDS, as well as for malaria, diarrheal diseases, and 
lower respiratory infections.

Ecological resilience is the magnitude of the largest perturbation from which a 
system can still recover to its original state. However, a transition into 
another state may often be invoked by a series of minor synergistic 
perturbations rather than a single big one. We show how resilience can be 
estimated in terms of average life expectancy, accounting for this natural 
regime of variability. We use time series to fit a model that captures the 
stochastic as well as the deterministic components. The model is then used to 
estimate the mean exit time from the basin of attraction. This approach offers a 
fresh angle to anticipating the chance of a critical transition at a time when 
high-resolution time series are becoming increasingly available.

Why we should not extend the 14-day rule.

The 14-day rule restricts the culturing of human embryos in vitro for the 
purposes of scientific research for no longer than 14 days. Since researchers 
recently developed the capability to exceed the 14-day limit, pressure to modify 
the rule has started to build. Sophia McCully argues that the limit should be 
extended to 28 days, listing numerous potential benefits of doing so. We contend 
that McCully has not engaged with the main reasons why the Warnock Committee set 
such a limit, and these still remain valid. As a result, her case for an 
extension of the 14-day rule is not persuasive.

Colonoscopies have reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) burden in the United States, 
and their utility has expanded to include various diagnostic and therapeutic 
indications. Complications are seen in up to 1% and increase with age and 
polypectomy. As colonoscopies become widespread, specific populations seem to be 
at a much higher risk; notably patients with heritable connective tissue 
disorders (HCTD). As life expectancy increases, these patients undergo routine 
screenings and require careful peri-endoscopic care to reduce adverse outcomes. 
Amongst HCTD, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is commonly implicated, however, no 
reports of Marfan syndrome (MS) exist. We present a unique case of splenic 
injury after colonoscopy in a patient with MS. Successful outcomes require early 
suspicion and emergent surgical evaluation in patients with hemodynamic 
instability after a colonoscopy. Increased ligament laxity and bowel fragility 
are the most likely mechanisms. Alternative CRC strategies like fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT), fecal occult, Cologuard, or virtual colonography can
