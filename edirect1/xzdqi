Renal transplantation is the gold-standard procedure for end-stage renal disease 
patients, improving quality of life and life expectancy. Despite continuous 
advancement in the management of post-transplant complications, progress is 
still needed to increase the graft lifespan. Early identification of patients at 
risk of rapid graft failure is critical to optimize their management and slow 
the progression of the disease. In 42 kidney grafts undergoing protocol biopsies 
at reperfusion, we estimated the renal metabolome from RNAseq data. The 
estimated metabolites' abundance was further used to predict the renal function 
within the first year of transplantation through a random forest machine 
learning algorithm. Using repeated K-fold cross-validation we first built and 
then tuned our model on a training dataset. The optimal model accurately 
predicted the one-year eGFR, with an out-of-bag root mean square root error 
(RMSE) that was 11.8 ± 7.2 mL/min/1.73 m2. The performance was similar in the 
test dataset, with a RMSE of 12.2 ± 3.2 mL/min/1.73 m2. This model outperformed 
classic statistical models. Reperfusion renal metabolome may be used to predict 
renal function one year after allograft kidney recipients.

Beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) is a hereditary genetic disease worsened by many 
comorbidities due to transfusion-related iron despite chelation therapy. Since 
there has recently been an increase in life expectancy of patients to up to 50 
years old, which influences the prevalence of these diseases and the time span 
for traditional cardiovascular risk factors to play their role, this study aims 
to evaluate their distribution and prevalence in a population of thalassemia 
major patients and their relationship with observed cardiovascular events and 
potential modifying factors. One hundred and fifty-nine β-TM patients with at 
least 15 years of follow-up were included in this study. The mean age was 40.9 ± 
8.4 years; 28% had diabetes mellitus and 62% had hypogonadism. The 
cardiovascular risk assessed using algorithms (CUORE and Pooled Cohort Risk 
Equation-PCRE) was low, but 3.8% of patients had at least one episode of heart 
failure, 35.9% showed early signs of heart failure, 22% received a diagnosis of 
diastolic dysfunction, and 21.4% showed supraventricular arrhythmias. 
Hypogonadism was shown to be related to the occurrence of cardiovascular events. 
The chronic accumulation of iron in the heart and the specific metabolic 
profile, mainly observed in patients with hypogonadism, allows us to define β-TM 
as a condition with a high level of cardiovascular risk from many points of view 
(iron-related myopathy, atherosclerosis and arrhythmias), which requires better 
stratification tools and a specific follow-up program.

Fruit juice is one of the most popular drinks, which requires strict processing 
conditions to ensure its quality, especially to prevent enzymatic browning and 
turbidity loss. In this work, a new strategy for the preparation of composite 
nanofibers for juice clarification and anti-browning control was proposed. The 
strategy used microfluidic spinning to combine Fucoxanthin (Fx), 
hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HP-γ-CD) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) to 
prepare Fx/HP-γ-CD-PVP (PCF) nanofibers, which not only reflected the excellent 
antioxidant properties of cyclodextrin-wrapped Fx, but also achieved a more 
optimized juice clarification agent dosage. Molecular docking technique was used 
to prove that the stable inclusion complex of Fx and HP-γ-CD could be formed by 
hydrogen bonding when the molar ratio of Fx to HP-γ-CD was 1 : 2, and the 
binding energy was as low as -10.23 kcal mol-1. SEM, XRD, FT-IR and TGA were 
used to characterize the structure of the composite nanofibers, which showed 
that the thermal stability and water solubility of the embedded Fx were 
improved. Further studies showed that the apple juice with PCF nanofibers 
containing inclusion complexes of Fx and HP-γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 (PCF 
1 : 2) could significantly improve the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging 
activity, and could significantly protect the cell membrane integrity of 
RAW264.7 cells against H2O2 oxidative damage. Finally, the effects of PCF 
nanofibers on the quality of fresh juice were studied, including clarification 
experiment and sensory evaluation. The results showed that the dosage of PVP in 
PCF 1 : 2 was only about 4% of the conventional dosage, and the browning index 
of fresh juice was significantly reduced with the best clarification. The 
available data provided in this study would provide a promising safety strategy 
for the food processing of fresh juice and the extension of its storage life.

OBJECTIVES: Even though the benefits of using Twitter for teaching and 
information exchange within the pathology community are primarily undisputed, a 
fair number of users refrain from sharing educational content on this social 
media platform. The survey aims to identify challenges in using Twitter as a 
pedagogical tool and discuss ways of converting those challenges into 
opportunities.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey-based study involving 174 
participants from the pathology community on Twitter.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that procurement of content was the major 
challenge faced by 36.2% of the participants, with most participants being 
concerned or very concerned regarding institutional policies and Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act issues. Content procurement 
concerns were followed by social media inertia, stated by 23% of the 
participants as an obstacle to posting educational content on Twitter.
CONCLUSIONS: The report helps elicit some common obstacles faced by the 
pathology and laboratory medicine community and allows us to recommend solutions 
to overcome these obstacles.

Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, AR 72401, USA.

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics threatens our progress in healthcare, modern 
medicine, food production and ultimately life expectancy. Antibiotic resistance 
is a global concern, which spreads rapidly across borders and continents due to 
rapid travel of people, animals and goods. Derivatives of metabolically stable 
pyrazole nucleus are known for their wide range of pharmacological properties, 
including antibacterial activities. This review highlights recent reports of 
pyrazole derivatives targeting different bacterial strains focusing on the 
drug-resistant variants. Pyrazole derivatives target different metabolic 
pathways of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

PURPOSE: Programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is the most 
studied biomarker to predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs), but its clinical significance is controversial. We estimated the 
distribution of PD-L1 expression scores (ie, tumor proportion score or combined 
proportion score) and the relationship between PD-L1 levels and ICIs' impact on 
overall survival (OS).
METHODS: We reconstructed, pooled, and analyzed individual-level data on 7,617 
patients with cancer from 14 randomized clinical trials. The effects of ICIs 
were quantified using differences in 24-month restricted mean survival times 
(ΔRMSTs; ie, the increase in life expectancy truncated at 2 years associated 
with ICI therapy). In a simulation study, we compared standard randomized 
clinical trial designs with a trial design that leverages meta-analytic results 
like ours.
RESULTS: Approximately 93% of patients had a PD-L1 expression ≤ 5% (66% of 
patients) or > 50% (27% of patients). OS improves with ICIs regardless of PD-L1 
expression level, which predicts the benefits' magnitude. For patients with 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ΔRMSTs ranged from 1.4 months (95% 
probability interval [PI], 0.7 to 2.2 months) for PD-L1 expression ≤ 1% to 4.1 
months (95% PI, 3.2 to 5.2 months) for PD-L1 expression > 80%. For patients with 
non-NSCLC tumors, ΔRMSTs ranged from 0.8 months (95% PI, -0.1 to 1.7 months) to 
2.3 months (95% PI, 1.3 to 4.4 months), again for PD-L1 expression levels of ≤ 
1% and > 80%, respectively. Simulations suggested that designs tailored to 
meta-analytic results can detect the effects of ICIs in PD-L1 subgroups with 
higher probability (> 15%) than standard designs.
CONCLUSION: The practice of dichotomizing the range of PD-L1 expression scores 
is inadequate for patient stratification. Meta-analytic estimates of the 
distribution of PD-L1 scores and subgroup-specific treatment effects can improve 
the designs of future trials of ICIs.

The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), a population-based study from a rural 
state in northeastern Germany with a relatively poor life expectancy, 
supplemented its comprehensive examination program in 2008 with whole-body MR 
imaging at 1.5 T (SHIP-MR). We reviewed more than 100 publications that used the 
SHIP-MR data and analyzed which sequences already produced fruitful scientific 
outputs and which manuscripts have been referenced frequently. Upon reviewing 
the publications about imaging sequences, those that used T1-weighted structured 
imaging of the brain and a gradient-echo sequence for R2* mapping obtained the 
highest scientific output; regarding specific body parts examined, most 
scientific publications focused on MR sequences involving the brain and the 
(upper) abdomen. We conclude that population-based MR imaging in cohort studies 
should define more precise goals when allocating imaging time. In addition, 
quality control measures might include recording the number and impact of 
published work, preferably on a bi-annual basis and starting 2 years after 
initiation of the study. Structured teaching courses may enhance the desired 
output in areas that appear underrepresented.

UVA is the most common type of solar UV radiation in aquatic environments; 
however, the effects it causes in shrimp farming in recirculating water systems 
(RAS) is unclear. Thus, the growth performance, immune responses, antioxidant 
status and apoptosis-related gene expression in Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus 
vannamei (body weight 9.56 ± 0.10 g), reared with 12L: 12D full spectrum light 
as background light under five UVA (peak at 400 nm) photoperiods (0L: 24D, 2L: 
22D, 4L: 20D, 8L: 16D and 12L: 12D) at a light intensity of 1 W/m2 were 
investigated. The results showed that the 2L: 22D and 4L: 20D UVA photoperiods 
enhanced the growth performance and reduced the feed conversion ratio and the 
shrimp mortality. Shrimp exposed to UVA (2L: 22D and 4L: 20D) also displayed 
higher levels of hepatopancreas catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), acid 
phosphatase (ACP), phenol oxidase (PO) and lysozyme (LZM) compared to the 8L: 
16D and 12L: 12D groups. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased in line with 
the extension of the UVA irradiation time. The mRNA expression of 
apoptosis-related genes in all the UVA treatments were significantly higher than 
with the control treatment, except for the 2L: 22D group. The results of the 2L: 
22D and 4L: 20D treatments were significantly higher than those of the control 
group, except for LGBP. In conclusion, 2L: 22D and 4L: 20D UVA photoperiods 
increased growth performance and decreased FCR, improved the innate immunity and 
antioxidant response and reduced the mortality rate in adult shrimp.

Human activities due to different land uses are being studied widely in many 
countries. This study aimed to determine the ecological risks and human health 
risk assessments (HHRA) of Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, and Zn in the topsoils of six land 
uses in Peninsular Malaysia. The ranges of the potentially toxic metals (PTMs) 
in the soils (mg/kg, dry weight) of this study were 0.24-12.43 for Cd (mean: 
1.94), 4.66-2363 for Cu (mean: 228), 2576-116,344 for Fe (mean: 32,618), 
2.38-75.67 for Ni (mean: 16.04), 7.22-969 for Pb (mean: 115) and 11.03-3820 for 
Zn (mean: 512). For the ecological risk assessments, the potential ecological 
risk index (PERI) for single metals indicated that the severity of pollution of 
the five metals decreased in the following sequence: Cd > Cu > Pb > Zn > Ni. It 
was found that industry, landfill, rubbish heap, and mining areas were 
categorized as "very high ecological risk". For HHRA, the land uses of industry, 
landfill and rubbish heap were found to have higher hazard quotient (HQ) values 
for the three pathways (with the order: ingestion > dermal contact > inhalation 
ingestion) of the five metals for children and adults, when compared to the 
mining, plantation, and residential areas. The values for both the 
non-carcinogenic (Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn), and carcinogenic risks (CR) for 
inhalation (Cd and Ni) obtained for children and adults in this study showed no 
serious adverse health impacts on their health. However, of public concern, the 
hazard index (HI), for Pb of children at the landfill (L-3) and the rubbish heap 
(RH-3) sites exceeded 1.0, indicating non-carcinogenic risk (NCR) for children. 
Therefore, these PERI and HHRA results provided fundamental data for PTMs 
pollution mitigation and environmental management in areas of different land 
uses in Peninsular Malaysia.

Tomato Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), is 
a destructive disease that threatens the agricultural production of tomatoes. In 
the present study, the biocontrol potential of strain KR2-7 against Fol was 
investigated through integrated genome mining and chemical analysis. Strain 
KR2-7 was identified as B. inaquosorum based on phylogenetic analysis. Through 
the genome mining of strain KR2-7, we identified nine antifungal and 
antibacterial compound biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) including fengycin, 
surfactin and Bacillomycin F, bacillaene, macrolactin, sporulation killing 
factor (skf), subtilosin A, bacilysin, and bacillibactin. The corresponding 
compounds were confirmed through MALDI-TOF-MS chemical analysis. The gene/gene 
clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion, and induced 
systemic resistance were also identified in the KR2-7 genome, and their related 
secondary metabolites were detected. In light of these results, the biocontrol 
potential of strain KR2-7 against tomato Fusarium wilt was identified. This 
study highlights the potential to use strain KR2-7 as a plant-growth promotion 
agent.

To timely initiate advance care planning in patients with advanced cancer, 
physicians should identify patients with limited life expectancy. We aimed to 
identify predictors of mortality. To identify the relevant literature, we 
searched Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and PubMed databases 
between January 2000-April 2020. Identified studies were assessed on 
risk-of-bias with a modified QUIPS tool. The main outcomes were predictors and 
prediction models of mortality within a period of 3-24 months. We included 
predictors that were studied in ≥2 cancer types in a meta-analysis using a fixed 
or random-effects model and summarized the discriminative ability of models. We 
included 68 studies (ranging from 42 to 66,112 patients), of which 24 were low 
risk-of-bias, and 39 were included in the meta-analysis. Using a fixed-effects 
model, the predictors of mortality were: the surprise question, performance 
status, cognitive impairment, (sub)cutaneous metastases, body mass index, 
comorbidity, serum albumin, and hemoglobin. Using a random-effects model, 
predictors were: disease stage IV (hazard ratio [HR] 7.58; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 4.00-14.36), lung cancer (HR 2.51; 95% CI 1.24-5.06), ECOG 
performance status 1+ (HR 2.03; 95% CI 1.44-2.86) and 2+ (HR 4.06; 95% CI 
2.36-6.98), age (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.38), male sex (HR 1.24; 95% CI 
1.14-1.36), and Charlson comorbidity score 3+ (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.11-2.32). 
Thirteen studies reported on prediction models consisting of different sets of 
predictors with mostly moderate discriminative ability. To conclude, we 
identified reasonably accurate non-tumor specific predictors of mortality. Those 
predictors could guide in developing a more accurate prediction model and in 
selecting patients for advance care planning.

In the present work, leptomeningeal disease, a very destructive form of systemic 
cancer, was characterized from several proteomics points of view. This pathology 
involves the invasion of the leptomeninges by malignant tumor cells. The tumor 
spreads to the central nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
has a very grim prognosis; the average life expectancy of patients who suffer it 
does not exceed 3 months. The early diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease is a 
challenge because, in most of the cases, it is an asymptomatic pathology. When 
the symptoms are clear, the disease is already in the very advanced stages and 
life expectancy is low. Consequently, there is a pressing need to determine 
useful CSF proteins to help in the diagnosis and/or prognosis of this disease. 
For this purpose, a systematic and exhaustive proteomics characterization of CSF 
by multipronged proteomics approaches was performed to determine different 
protein profiles as potential biomarkers. Proteins such as PTPRC, SERPINC1, 
sCD44, sCD14, ANPEP, SPP1, FCGR1A, C9, sCD19, and sCD34, among others, and their 
functional analysis, reveals that most of them are linked to the pathology and 
are not detected on normal CSF. Finally, a panel of biomarkers was verified by a 
prediction model for leptomeningeal disease, showing new insights into the 
research for potential biomarkers that are easy to translate into the clinic for 
the diagnosis of this devastating disease.

These days many leading scientists argue for a new paradigm for cancer research 
and propose a complex systems-view of cancer supported by empirical evidence. As 
an example, Thea Newman (2021) has applied "the lessons learned from physical 
systems to a critique of reductionism in medical research, with an emphasis on 
cancer". It is the understanding of this author that the mesoscale constructs 
that combine the bottom-up as well as top-down approaches, are very close to the 
concept of emergence. The mesoscale constructs can be said to be those effective 
components through which the system allows itself to be understood. A short list 
of basic concepts related to life/biology fundamentals are first introduced to 
demonstrate a lack of emphasis on these matters in literature. It is imperative 
that physical and chemical approaches are introduced and incorporated in biology 
to make it more conceptually sound, quantitative, and based on the first 
principles. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is the only tool currently available 
for making progress in this direction. A brief outline of systems biology, the 
discovery of emergent properties, and metabolic modeling are introduced in the 
second part. Then, different cancer initiation concepts are reviewed, followed 
by application of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in the metabolic and genomic 
analysis of initiation and development of cancer, stressing the endogenous 
network hypothesis (ENH). Finally, extension of the ENH is suggested to include 
a cancer niche (exogenous network hypothesis). It is expected that this will 
lead to a unifying systems-biology approach for a future combination of the 
analytical and synthetic arms of two major hypotheses of cancer models (SMT and 
TOFT).

Spent caustic effluents are very challenging due to their very hazardous nature 
in terms of toxicity as well as their extreme pH (approximately 12-14). Spent 
caustic has presented a challenge for wastewater treatment in refineries, due to 
its composition rich in mercaptans, sulfides and other aromatic compounds. To 
address such problems, membrane filtration was studied using real effluents from 
Sines Refinery, in Portugal. The present study attempts to assess the potential 
for spent caustic treatment with nanofiltration (NF) polymeric and ceramic 
membranes, assessing membrane life expectancy. For that, membrane aging studies 
in static mode were performed with the polymeric membrane before attempting NF 
treatment (dynamic studies). A ceramic membrane was also tested for the first 
time with this type of effluents, though only in dynamic mode. Although the 
polymeric membrane performance was very good and in accordance with previous 
studies, its lifespan was very reduced after 6 weeks of contact with spent 
caustic, compromising its use in an industrial unit. Contrarily to expectations, 
the ceramic membrane tested was not chemically more resistant than the polymeric 
one upon direct contact with spent caustic (loss of retention capacity in less 
than 1 h in contact with the spent caustic). The results obtained suggest that a 
pH of 13.9 is very aggressive, even for ceramic membranes.

Increases in life expectancy mean that an unprecedented number of individuals 
are reaching centenarian status, often with complex health concerns. We analyzed 
nationally representative hospital admissions data (200-2009) from the National 
Inpatient Study (NIS) for 52,618 centenarians (aged 100-115 years, mean age 
101.4). We predicted length of stay (LOS) via negative binomial models and total 
inflation adjusted costs via fixed effects regression analysis informed by 
descriptive data. We also identified hospitalizations due to ambulatory 
care-sensitive conditions defined by AHRQ Prevention Quality Indicators. Mean 
LOS decreased from 6.1 to 5.1 days, while over the same time period the mean 
total adjusted charges rose from USD 13,373 to USD 25,026 in 2009 dollars. 
Black, Hispanic, Asian, or other race centenarians had higher cost stays 
compared to White, but only Black and Hispanic centenarians had significantly 
greater mean length of stay. Comorbidities predicted greater length of stay and 
higher costs. Centenarians admitted on weekends had higher costs but shorter 
length of stay. In total, 29.4% of total costs were due to potentially 
preventable hospitalizations for total charges (2000-2009) of USD 341.8M in 2009 
dollars. Centenarian hospitalizations cost significantly more than 
hospitalization for any other group of elderly in the U.S.

BACKGROUND: Oral cancer (OC) is a common tumour that poses a threat to human 
health and imposes a heavy burden on countries. This study assessed the burden 
imposed by OC on the 10 most populous countries from 1990 to 2019 on the basis 
of gender, age and socio-demographic index.
METHODS: Data on incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and 
corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) for OC in the 10 most populous 
countries from 1990 to 2019 were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019. Estimated annual percentage changes were calculated to assess the trends 
of morbidity, mortality and DALY. The indicator that served as a proxy for 
survival rate was the supplement of mortality-to-incidence ratio (SMIR) (1 - 
(M/I)).
RESULTS: The number of new cases, deaths and DALY have increased in all 10 
countries in the past 30 years. Trends in age-standardised incidence rates 
(ASIR), age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardised DALY for OC 
in the 10 most populous countries varied. The SMIR increased in all countries, 
with most countries having an SMIR between 30% and 50%. In 2019, the United 
States had the highest SMIR at 76%, whereas Russia had the lowest at 21.7%. 
Incidence and mortality were close between male and female subjects in Japan, 
Indonesia, Mexico, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The incidence and mortality 
in male subjects in the United States, Russia, China and Brazil were two or more 
times those of female subjects. Gender difference was highest among patients 
aged 40-69 years.
CONCLUSION: Trends and gender differences in ASIR, ASMR and age-standardised 
DALY for OC vary in the 10 most populous countries. Government cancer programs 
are often expensive to run, especially in countries with large populations. 
Policy makers need to take these differences into account when formulating 
policies.

Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in women globally. 
Sex and advancing age represent the dominant risk factors, with strong evidence 
of alcohol as a modifiable risk factor. The carcinogenic nature of alcohol has 
been known for over twenty years; however, this has failed to translate into 
significant behavioural, practice, or policy change. As a result, women have not 
benefitted from this research and, by extension, have been exposed to 
unnecessary breast cancer risk. Participatory research presents a solution to 
research translation in public health through the collaboration of impacted 
populations with academics in research. This systematic review examines 
peer-reviewed research studies where participants were involved in the research 
process and the outcomes related to breast cancer prevention (either alcohol or 
broader lifestyle modification). Seven of the eight studies reported positive 
effects, and the collaboration between academic researchers and impacted 
populations may have supported positive outcomes. Women were receptive and 
responsive to participatory approaches, and their participation is important to 
address socially entrenched behaviours such as alcohol consumption. 
Participatory research presents opportunities for future interventions to 
improve (or address) modifiable risk factors for breast cancer.

Targets.

Fighting cancer is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. Among 
recently proposed treatments, molecular-targeted therapies are attracting 
particular attention. The potential targets of such therapies include a group of 
enzymes that possess the capability to catalyze at least two different 
reactions, so-called multifunctional enzymes. The features of such enzymes can 
be used to good advantage in the development of potent selective inhibitors. 
This review discusses the potential of multifunctional enzymes as anti-cancer 
drug targets along with the current status of research into four enzymes which 
by their inhibition have already demonstrated promising anti-cancer effects in 
vivo, in vitro, or both. These are PFK-2/FBPase-2 (involved in glucose 
homeostasis), ATIC (involved in purine biosynthesis), LTA4H (involved in the 
inflammation process) and Jmjd6 (involved in histone and non-histone 
posttranslational modifications). Currently, only LTA4H and PFK-2/FBPase-2 have 
inhibitors in active clinical development. However, there are several studies 
proposing potential inhibitors targeting these four enzymes that, when used 
alone or in association with other drugs, may provide new alternatives for 
preventing cancer cell growth and proliferation and increasing the life 
expectancy of patients.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasingly incorporated in evidence-based 
screening and treatment guidelines to facilitate patient-centered clinical 
decision-making. However, life expectancy estimates from standard life tables do 
not account for health status, an important prognostic factor for premature 
death. This study aims to address this research gap and develop life tables 
incorporating the health status of adults in the United States.
METHODS: Data from the National Health Interview Survey (1986-2004) linked to 
mortality follow-up through to 2006 (age ≥ 40, n = 729,531) were used to develop 
life tables. The impact of self-rated health (excellent, very good, good, fair, 
poor) on survival was quantified in 5-year age groups, incorporating complex 
survey design and weights. Life expectancies were estimated by extrapolating the 
modeled survival probabilities.
RESULTS: Life expectancies incorporating health status differed substantially 
from standard US life tables and by health status. Poor self-rated health more 
significantly affected the survival of younger compared to older individuals, 
resulting in substantial decreases in life expectancy. At age 40 years, hazards 
of dying for white men who reported poor vs. excellent health was 8.5 (95% CI: 
7.0,10.3) times greater, resulting in a 23-year difference in life expectancy 
(poor vs. excellent: 22 vs. 45), while at age 80 years, the hazards ratio was 
2.4 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.8) and life expectancy difference was 5 years (5 vs. 10). 
Relative to the US general population, life expectancies of adults (age < 65) 
with poor health were approximately 5-15 years shorter.
CONCLUSIONS: Considerable shortage in life expectancy due to poor self-rated 
health existed. The life table developed can be helpful by including a patient 
perspective on their health and be used in conjunction with other predictive 
models in clinical decision making, particularly for younger adults in poor 
health, for whom life tables including comorbid conditions are limited.

BACKGROUND: The residual lifetime risk (RLR) of developing heart failure (HF) 
may have changed over time because of the increasing population burden of 
hypertension, obesity, and diabetes; greater survival after myocardial 
infarction; and a greater lifespan.
OBJECTIVES: The authors assessed changes in the RLR for HF in two 25-year epochs 
(1965-1989 and 1990-2014).
METHODS: We compared the RLR of HF at age 50 years (adjusting for competing risk 
of death) in the 2 epochs in Framingham Study participants overall and in the 
following strata: sex, body mass index, blood pressure, and diabetes.
RESULTS: Mean life expectancy increased from 75.9 to 82.1 years in women and 
72.5 to 78.1 years in men. We observed 624 HF events over 111,351 
person-observations in epoch 1, and 875 HF events over 128,903 
person-observations in epoch 2. The mean age at onset of HF increased across the 
epochs by 6.6 years (women) to 7.2 years (men). The RLR of HF at age 50 years 
increased across epochs from 18.86% to 22.55% (absolute increase 3.69; 95% CI: 
0.90-6.49; P = 0.01) in women, and from 19.19% to 25.25% (absolute increase 
6.06; 95% CI: 3.08-9.04; P < 0.001) in men. The increase in RLR of HF in the 
second epoch was consistent across strata with excess body mass index or higher 
blood pressure (relative increase of 28%-47%) and in participants without prior 
myocardial infarction (relative increase of 23%).
CONCLUSIONS: The RLR of HF has increased in our community-based sample of White 
individuals over the last 5 decades, possibly caused by an increase in life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Postoperative neck symptoms, including pain, swelling, uncomfortable 
feelings during swallowing, and incision adhesion formation, are common in 
patients after lobectomy through the traditional middle neck approach. A new 
unilateral supraclavicular approach is proposed to protect the anterior cervical 
region and reduce related complications. The aim of this study is to investigate 
the efficacy, safety, and advantages of the supraclavicular approach in 
lobectomy for unilateral papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-three patients were recruited into either a 
conventional middle group (CM) or a new supraclavicular (NS) group. 
Clinicopathological features, surgically related variables, and postoperative 
symptoms were recorded. Quality of life (QOL) of all patients was assessed by 
the 12-item short-form health survey (SF-12) and thyroid cancer-specific QOL 
(THYCA-QoL) questionnaire in 3 and 12 months.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in 
clinicopathological features (including sex, age, multifocality, extrathyroidal 
extension, histological variants, largest tumor diameter, Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis, metastasized central lymph node, removed central lymph node, 
surgeon, BRAF mutation, and follow-up duration), hospitalization (including 
hospital cost, surgery time, and blood loss during surgery), and complications 
between the two groups. Patients who underwent lobectomy through the NS approach 
had significantly better SF-12 physical, mental, and THYCA-QoL than the CM group 
patients in both 3 and 12 months (all p < 0.001). Moreover, the NS group had a
