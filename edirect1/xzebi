Disparities in treatment intensity can contribute to racial disparities in 
overall breast cancer survival. A natural extension of measuring racial 
disparities in treatment intensity is consideration of the distribution of 
treatment toxicities, symptoms, and distress that lead to chemotherapy dose 
reductions, holds or early termination. There is growing evidence that 
therapeutic toxicity during early-stage breast cancer treatment may be greater 
among Black women than White. Important components of symptom management involve 
the communication of symptoms, the self-care abilities of the patient, the 
patient's perception of the clinical encounter, and the patient centeredness of 
the clinical encounter. Racial differences in the symptom reporting, the 
clinical "reception" and response to symptoms, the prescribed management, and 
the patient adherence to symptom management requires further investigation. 
Further research must also consider the structural inequities, as well as 
institutional and interpersonal racism that contribute to racial differences in 
cancer symptom burden leading to potential decreases in dose intensity of 
potentially life-saving early cancer treatment. See related article by Hu et 
al., p. 167.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the discriminative power of 3 comorbidity scores 
for predicting 5-year survival after the elective repair of aorto-iliac 
aneurysms (AAA).
METHODS: 444 patients with AAA undergoing elective repair (33% open and 67% 
endovascular) between 2000 and 2020 were reviewed. The Charlson Comorbidity 
Index (CCI) and subsequent adjustments by Schneeweiss, Quan and Armitage, the 
Modified Frailty Index (MFI) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Score 
(ASA) were calculated from preoperative data. Their association with 5-year 
survival was analyzed using Cox regression models and their discriminative power 
and its changes with C statistics and Net Reclassification Index (NRI).
RESULTS: All comorbidity scores were associated with survival after adjusting by 
age, sex and type of surgical repair: original CCI HR=1.24, P<0.001; Schneeweiss 
CCI HR=1.23, P<0.001; Quan CCI HR=1.27, P<0.001, Armitage CCI HR=1.46, P<0.001, 
MFI HR=1.39, P<0.001 and ASA HR=1.68 (P=0.04) and 2.86 (P=0.01) for classes III 
and IV, respectively. Associated C statistics were of 0.64, 0.65, 0.65, 0.64, 
0.61 and 0.59, respectively. Compared with the original CCI, models based on 
Schneeweiss CCI and Armitage CCI provided minor improvements in NRI (0.32 and 
0.23), and the model based on ASA showed lower C statistics (P=0.014) and NRI 
(-0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: Established comorbidity scores, such as CCI, MFI or ASA, are all 
associated with 5-year survival after the elective repair of AAAs, being ASA the 
worst of them. However, their predictive power is in no case sufficient to 
identify, by themselves, those patients who may not be eligible for intervention 
on the basis of life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Frailty assessment is an important marker of the older adult's 
fitness for cancer treatment independent of age. Pretreatment geriatric 
assessment (GA) is associated with improved mortality and morbidity outcomes but 
must occur in a time sensitive manner to be useful for cancer treatment decision 
making. Unfortunately, time, resources and other constraints make GA difficult 
to perform in busy oncology clinics. We developed the Cancer and Aging 
Interdisciplinary Team (CAIT) clinic model to provide timely GA and treatment 
recommendations independent of patient's physical location.
METHODS: The interdisciplinary CAIT clinic model was developed utilizing the 
surge in telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The core team consists of 
the patient's oncologist, geriatrician, registered nurse, pharmacist, and 
registered dietitian. The clinic's format is flexible, and the various 
assessments can be asynchronous. Patients choose the service method-in person, 
remotely, or hybrid. Based on GA outcomes, the geriatrician provides 
recommendations and arrange interventions. An assessment summary including life 
expectancy estimates and chemotoxicity risk calculator scores is conveyed to and 
discussed with the treating oncologist. Physician and patient satisfaction were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Between May 2021 and June 2022, 50 patients from multiple physical 
locations were evaluated in the CAIT clinic. Sixty-eight percent was 80 years of 
age or older (range 67-99). All the evaluations were hybrid. The median days 
between receiving a referral and having the appointment was 8. GA detected 
multiple unidentified impairments. About half of the patients (52%) went on to 
receive chemotherapy (24% standard dose, 28% with dose modifications). The rest 
received radiation (20%), immune (12%) or hormonal (4%) therapies, 2% underwent 
surgery, 2% chose alternative medicine, 8% were placed under observation, and 6% 
enrolled in hospice care. Feedback was extremely positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The successful development of the CAIT clinic model provides strong 
support for the potential dissemination across services and institutions.

IMPORTANCE: Deprescribing is a promising approach to addressing the burden of 
polypharmacy. Few studies have initiated comprehensive deprescribing in the 
hospital setting among older patients requiring ongoing care in a postacute care 
(PAC) facility.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a patient-centered deprescribing 
intervention among hospitalized older adults transitioning or being discharged 
to a PAC facility.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial of the 
Shed-MEDS (Best Possible Medication History, Evaluate, Deprescribing 
Recommendations, and Synthesis) deprescribing intervention was conducted between 
March 2016 and October 2020. Patients who were admitted to an academic medical 
center and discharged to 1 of 22 PAC facilities affiliated with the medical 
center were recruited. Patients who were 50 years or older and had 5 or more 
prehospital medications were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to the intervention 
group or control group. Patients who were non-English speaking, were unhoused, 
were long-stay residents of nursing homes, or had less than 6 months of life 
expectancy were excluded. An intention-to-treat approach was used.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received the Shed-MEDS intervention, which 
consisted of a pharmacist- or nurse practitioner-led comprehensive medication 
review, patient or surrogate-approved deprescribing recommendations, and 
deprescribing actions that were initiated in the hospital and continued 
throughout the PAC facility stay. The control group received usual care at the 
hospital and PAC facility.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the total medication count 
at hospital discharge and PAC facility discharge, with follow-up assessments 
during the 90-day period after PAC facility discharge. Secondary outcomes 
included the total number of potentially inappropriate medications at each time 
point, the Drug Burden Index, and adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 372 participants (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [10.7] years; 229 
females [62%]) were randomized to the intervention or control groups. Of these 
participants, 284 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (142 in the 
intervention group and 142 in the control group). Overall, there was a 
statistically significant treatment effect, with patients in the intervention 
group taking a mean of 14% fewer medications at PAC facility discharge (mean 
ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93; P < .001) and 15% fewer medications at the 
90-day follow-up (mean ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.92; P < .001) compared with 
the control group. The intervention additionally reduced patient exposure to 
potentially inappropriate medications and Drug Burden Index. Adverse drug event 
rates were similar between the intervention and control groups (hazard ratio, 
0.83; 95% CI, 0.52-1.30).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this trial showed that the Shed-MEDS 
patient-centered deprescribing intervention was safe and effective in reducing 
the total medication burden at PAC facility discharge and 90 days after 
discharge. Future studies are needed to examine the effect of this intervention 
on patient-reported and long-term clinical outcomes.

Individuals with C5 or C6 spinal cord injury (SCI) have paralysis of the triceps 
brachii, and the subsequent loss of elbow extension makes it impossible to 
reliably use their hands above shoulder level because of the inability to hold 
the elbow extended against gravity. For persons with cervical SCI, elbow 
extension can be restored with both tendon and nerve transfers. Elbow extension 
is necessary for dressing, eating, wheelchair locomotion, pressure relief 
maneuvers, independent transfers, and reaching objects above shoulder level. 
Deltoid-to-triceps and biceps-to-triceps tendon transfers have established 
efficacy and a longer history of use. Transfer of motor branches from the 
axillary nerve to triceps motor branches is new with no current published 
prospective studies but shows early promise. This review aims to highlight the 
amazing potential these procedures can have on the independence and quality of 
life for people with quadriplegia. Despite the immense benefit possible, fewer 
than 14% of eligible people with cervical SCI in the United States receive upper 
limb reconstructive surgery. Surgical timing is critical. A broader 
understanding and raised awareness of reconstructive options for elbow extension 
in people with quadriplegia will increase recognition of eligible patients and 
speed referral time to the appropriate practitioner.

BACKGROUND: In their 2021 lung cancer screening recommendation update, the U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evaluated strategies that select people 
based on their personal lung cancer risk (risk model-based strategies), 
highlighting the need for further research on the benefits and harms of risk 
model-based screening.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of risk model-based 
lung cancer screening strategies versus the USPSTF recommendation and to explore 
optimal risk thresholds.
DESIGN: Comparative modeling analysis.
DATA SOURCES: National Lung Screening Trial; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results program; U.S. Smoking History Generator.
TARGET POPULATION: 1960 U.S. birth cohort.
TIME HORIZON: 45 years.
PERSPECTIVE: U.S. health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Annual low-dose computed tomography in risk model-based strategies 
that start screening at age 50 or 55 years, stop screening at age 80 years, with 
6-year risk thresholds between 0.5% and 2.2% using the PLCOm2012 model.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 
cost-effectiveness efficiency frontier connecting strategies with the highest 
health benefit at a given cost.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Risk model-based screening strategies were more 
cost-effective than the USPSTF recommendation and exclusively comprised the 
cost-effectiveness efficiency frontier. Among the strategies on the efficiency 
frontier, those with a 6-year risk threshold of 1.2% or greater were 
cost-effective with an ICER less than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY). Specifically, the strategy with a 1.2% risk threshold had an ICER of 
$94 659 (model range, $72 639 to $156 774), yielding more QALYs for less cost 
than the USPSTF recommendation, while having a similar level of screening 
coverage (person ever-screened 21.7% vs. USPSTF's 22.6%).
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Risk model-based strategies were robustly more 
cost-effective than the 2021 USPSTF recommendation under varying modeling 
assumptions.
LIMITATION: Risk models were restricted to age, sex, and smoking-related risk 
predictors.
CONCLUSION: Risk model-based screening is more cost-effective than the USPSTF 
recommendation, thus warranting further consideration.

BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation is a proven management method for end-stage 
cirrhosis and is estimated to have increased life expectancy by 15 years. The 
COVID-19 pandemic posed a challenge to patients who were candid for a 
solid-organ transplant. It has been suggested that the outcomes of liver 
transplants could be adversely affected by the infection, as immunosuppression 
makes liver transplant candidates more susceptible to adverse effects while 
predisposing them to higher thrombotic events.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the cases who received liver 
transplants from January 2018 to March 2022 were assessed regarding early 
postoperative mortality rate and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) with COVID-19 
infection. This study included 614 cases, of which 48 patients were infected.
RESULTS: This study shows that the early COVID-19-related early postoperative 
mortality rates substantially increased in the elective setting (OR: 2.697), but 
the results for the acute liver failure were insignificant. The average model 
for end-stage liver disease score increased significantly during the pandemic 
due to new regulations. Although mortality rates increased during the pandemic, 
the data for the vaccination period show that mortality rates have equalised 
with the prepandemic era. Meanwhile, COVID-19 infection is assumed to have 
increased HAT by 1.6 times in the elective setting.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that COVID-19 infection in an acute liver failure 
poses comparatively little risk; hence transplantation should be considered in 
such cases. Meanwhile, the hypercoagulative state induced by the infection 
predisposes this group of patients to higher HAT rates.

BACKGROUND: Structured life course modelling approaches (SLCMA) have been 
developed to understand how exposures across the lifespan relate to later 
health, but have primarily been restricted to single exposures. As multiple 
exposures can jointly impact health, here we: i) demonstrate how to extend SLCMA 
to include exposure interactions; ii) conduct a simulation study investigating 
the performance of these methods; and iii) apply these methods to explore 
associations of access to green space, and its interaction with socioeconomic 
position, with child cardiometabolic health.
METHODS: We used three methods, all based on lasso regression, to select the 
most plausible life course model: visual inspection, information criteria and 
cross-validation. The simulation study assessed the ability of these approaches 
to detect the correct interaction term, while varying parameters which may 
impact power (e.g., interaction magnitude, sample size, exposure collinearity). 
Methods were then applied to data from a UK birth cohort.
RESULTS: There were trade-offs between false negatives and false positives in 
detecting the true interaction term for different model selection methods. 
Larger sample size, lower exposure collinearity, centering exposures, continuous 
outcomes and a larger interaction effect all increased power. In our applied 
example we found little-to-no association between access to green space, or its 
interaction with socioeconomic position, and child cardiometabolic outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating interactions between multiple exposures is an 
important extension to SLCMA. The choice of method depends on the researchers' 
assessment of the risks of under- vs over-fitting. These results also provide 
guidance for improving power to detect interactions using these methods.

PTEN dysfunction, caused by loss of lipid phosphatase activity or deletion, 
promotes pathologies, cancer, benign tumors, and neurodevelopmental disorders 
(NDDs). Despite efforts, exactly how the mutations trigger distinct phenotypic 
outcomes, cancer or NDD, has been puzzling. It has also been unclear how to 
distinguish between mutations harbored by isoforms, are they cancer or 
NDDs-related. Here we address both. We demonstrate that PTEN mutations 
differentially allosterically bias P-loop dynamics and its connection to the 
catalytic site, affecting catalytic activity. NDD-related mutations are likely 
to sample conformations present in the wild-type, while sampled conformations 
sheltering cancer-related hotspots favor catalysis-prone conformations, 
suggesting that NDD mutations are weaker. Analysis of isoform expression data 
indicates that if the transcript has NDD-related mutations, alone or in 
combination with cancer hotspots, there is high prenatal expression. If no 
mutations within the measured days, low expression levels. Cancer mutations 
promote stronger signaling and cell proliferation; NDDs' are weaker, influencing 
brain cell differentiation. Further, exon 5 is impacted by NDD or non-NDD 
mutations, while exon 7 is exclusively impacted by NDD mutations. Our 
comprehensive conformational and genomic analysis helps discover how same allele 
mutations can foster different clinical manifestations and uncovers correlations 
of splicing isoform expression to life expectancy.

AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant pembrolizumab versus 
observation for patients with resected stage IIB/IIC melanoma from a third-party 
payers' perspective in Switzerland over a lifetime horizon.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov state transition model with four health states 
(recurrence-free [RF], locoregional recurrence, distant metastases [DM], and 
death) was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus 
observation as an adjuvant treatment in patients with stage IIB/IIC melanoma who 
have undergone complete resection. The model utilized data from the KEYNOTE-716 
randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03553836). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (Swiss Franc [CHF] per life year or 
quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained) was calculated. A probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and deterministic sensitivity analysis were conducted to 
assess the robustness of the base case results.
RESULTS: Model results demonstrated that pembrolizumab is highly cost-effective 
as an adjuvant treatment for resected stage IIB/IIC melanoma versus observation 
in Switzerland. Base case results showed an ICER of CHF 27,424/QALY (EUR 
27,342/QALY; exchange rate: 1 CHF = 0.997 EUR) for pembrolizumab versus 
observation. Results were most sensitive to changes to transition probabilities 
from the RF state. Most sensitivity and scenario analyses resulted in ICERs 
below the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of CHF 100,000. At this WTP, 
pembrolizumab had a 78.9% probability of being cost-effective versus 
observation.
LIMITATIONS: Due to a limited follow-up period in the KEYNOTE-716 trial, data 
from other clinical trials in the advanced melanoma setting were synthesized in 
a network meta-analysis and used to inform transition probabilities from DM to 
death in the cost-effectiveness model, to overcome the absence of these data 
from the trial.
CONCLUSION: The model demonstrated that pembrolizumab is highly cost-effective 
versus observation in patients with resected stage IIB/IIC melanoma in 
Switzerland. The ICER was below the WTP threshold of CHF 100,000, commonly used 
for cost-effectiveness models in Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: Veterans are disproportionately affected by housing insecurity (HI), 
which can lead to adverse health outcomes and reduced life expectancy. We sought 
to examine the impact of HI on the outcomes of veterans who underwent abdominal 
aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair at our regional Veterans Affairs medical center.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on patients who underwent AAA 
repair at our institution between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2020. We 
examined medical history, procedure details, hospitalization course, and 
postoperative outcomes. Primary endpoints were a 30-day mortality and median 
survival. Secondary endpoints were hospital length of stay, readmission rate, 
and perioperative complications. Hypothesis testing was performed with t-test 
and chi-squared analysis. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier 
estimation.
RESULTS: Of the 314 veterans that underwent AAA repair (mean age of 
71.4 ± 7.8 years, 99.7% male) over the 21-year period, we identified 39 (12.4%) 
patients with a history of HI. The HI was associated with a positive smoking 
history (100% vs. 88.0%, P = 0.022), lower rate of hypertension diagnosis (69.2% 
vs. 84.0%, P = 0.024), and increased rate of surgical site infections (SSI) 
(10.3% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.016). The median postoperative survival was lower in the 
HI group (7.6 years [CI 6.0-11.2] vs. 8.9 [CI 6.9-10.3]).
CONCLUSIONS: HI was associated with reduced median postoperative survival, 
greater readmission rate, and increased risk of SSI following AAA repair.

Aim      To evaluate changes in traditional risk factors (RF) during cardiac 
rehabilitation (CR) programs with remote support in patients with paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation (AF) after catheter ablation (CA).Material and methods  The 
lack of control of cardiovascular RFs is a predictor for AF recurrence after CA, 
development of complications, and decreased life expectancy. Telemedical CR 
programs may improve the control of RF and enhance the CR efficacy. This 
randomized controlled clinical study in three parallel groups included 135 
patients aged 35 to 79 years. In groups 1 and 2, CR programs with remote support 
were performed, which included a single personal consulting for the disease, 
achieving control of all patient's RFs, and remote support during 3 months 
(group 1, by phone and group 2, by e-mail). Participants of group 3 received 
standard recommendations. Body weight, blood pressure (BP), blood lipids, 
smoking status, and physical activity (PA) were determined at baseline and at 12 
months after CA with the IPAQ questionnaire.Results In both intervention groups 
at 12 months, there were positive changes in RF: body weight index decreased by 
3.6 % in group 1 (р=0.01) and by 2.3 % in group 2 (р=0.002) vs. 0 in the control 
group; systolic BP decreased by 7.1 % (p&lt;0.001) and 1.5 % (p=0.003) in groups 
1 and 2 (vs. increases by 3.3 % in group 2); total cholesterol decreased by 
9.4 % (p&lt;0.001) and by 6.3 % (p=0.003), respectively, (vs. 0 in group 3); 
values of metabolic equivalents (METs) used for walking increased by 55.0 % 
(р=0.014), 75.0 % (р=0.001), and 1.4 % in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. No 
significant intergroup differences in the frequency of AF recurrence, repeated 
CA, and hospitalizations were found.Conclusion      CR programs with remote 
support provide improved control of BP, body weight, blood cholesterol, and AF 
in patients with AF after CA, according to the results of the one-year 
follow-up.

Metastases from primary prostate cancers to rare locations, such as the brain, 
are becoming more common due to longer life expectancy resulting from improved 
treatments. Epigenetic dysregulation is a feature of primary prostate cancer, 
and distinct DNA methylation profiles have been shown to be associated with the 
mutually exclusive SPOP-mutant or TMPRSS2-ERG fusion genetic backgrounds. Using 
a cohort of prostate cancer brain metastases (PCBM) from 42 patients, with 
matched primary tumors for 17 patients, we carried out a DNA methylation 
analysis to examine the epigenetic distinction between primary prostate cancer 
and PCBM, the association between epigenetic alterations and mutational 
background, and particular epigenetic alterations that may be associated with 
PCBM. Multiregion sampling of PCBM revealed epigenetic stability within 
metastases. Aberrant methylation in PCBM was associated with mutational 
background and PRC2 complex activity, an effect that is particularly pronounced 
in SPOP-mutant PCBM. While PCBM displayed a CpG island hypermethylator 
phenotype, hypomethylation at the promoters of genes involved in neuroactive 
ligand-receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules such as GABRB3, CLDN8, 
and CLDN4 was also observed, suggesting that cells from primary tumors may 
require specific reprogramming to form brain metastasis. This study revealed the 
DNA methylation landscapes of PCBM and the potential mechanisms and effects of 
PCBM-associated aberrant DNA methylation.
SIGNIFICANCE: DNA methylation analysis reveals the molecular characteristics of 
PCBM and may serve as a starting point for efforts to identify and target 
susceptibilities of these rare metastases.

College), Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.

BACKGROUND: Sunitinib was approved several years ago as a first-line drug for 
treating metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC); however, its high price and 
broad side effects when administered at the standard dose have limited its 
clinical use. A clinical trial (NCT02072031) confirmed that anlotinib could be 
used as the first-line treatment for mRCC. This study was conducted to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of anlotinib as a first-line treatment for mRCC compared 
to that of sunitinib in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was established to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
anlotinib with that of sunitinib. Clinical data were obtained from a 
multi-center phase II trial (clinical trial information: NCT02072031). Utility 
values were obtained from the literature. Total costs were calculated from a 
Chinese societal perspective. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the 
model uncertainty. The life-year (LY), quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis over a lifetime horizon of 10 years showed that 
the anlotinib group had 2.196 LYs and 1.487 QALYs at a total cost of $68,597.84. 
The sunitinib group had 2.194 LYs and 1.432 QALYs at a total cost of $88,060.02. 
This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of anlotinib 
versus sunitinib of $-9,210,858.93 per LYs and $-354,117.07 per QALYs, 
suggesting that anlotinib is a more effective and less costly strategy than 
sunitinib.
CONCLUSION: Anlotinib may be a more cost-effective first-line treatment strategy 
for mRCC than sunitinib in China.

INTRODUCTION: Fear of falling (FoF) is a major challenge for the quality of life 
among older adults. Despite extensive work in previous scoping and systematic 
reviews on separate domains of FoF and interventions related to FoF, very little 
attention has been devoted to a comprehensive scoping review mapping the range 
and scope of this burgeoning area of study, with only a few exceptions. This 
scoping review aims to provide an overarching review mapping FoF research by 
identifying main topics, gaps in the literature and potential opportunities for 
bridging different strains of research on FoF. Such a comprehensive scoping 
review will allow the subsequent creation of an interdisciplinary theoretical 
and empirical framework, which may help push forward policy and practice 
innovations for people living with FoF.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR), seven main databases will be searched from 2000 to the date of the 
start of the review: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, Embase, 
MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Scopus and Web of Science. The review will include original 
research in English, published between 2000 and January 2023. Quality checks 
will be conducted collegially. Data will be extracted and analysed using 
PRISMA-ScR charting tools and conventions.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is required for the review. The 
results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at academic 
conferences. The outcomes will be disseminated through social media, opinion 
pieces and science communication platforms to reach a wider audience.
REGISTRATION: The scoping review was registered with the Open Science Framework 
(https://osf.io/gyzjq).

Globally increased life expectancy strongly triggered interest to delay the 
onset of frailty, which has been associated with alterations in compositional 
and functional characteristics of intestinal microbiota. In the current study, 
we used an in vitro batch incubation model to compare the metabolic capacity of 
the faecal microbiota of adults (n = 6) versus pre-frail elderly (n = 6) to 
degrade various glycosidic carbohydrates, including galacto-oligosaccharides, 
2'-fucosyllactose, chicory fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin, and 
isomalto/malto-polysaccharides. The in vitro metabolic capacity was also 
compared with an in vivo GOS intervention study based on the same subjects. 
Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and metabolites revealed distinct portions 
of variation in overall microbiota and metabolite composition during incubation 
being explained by individuality of the subjects and carbon source. In addition, 
the age group of the subjects also had significant impact on microbiota 
variation, carbohydrate degradation and metabolite production. This was 
accompanied by elevated increase in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in 
the microbiota of adults compared to that of pre-frail elderly and significantly 
decreased effectiveness to degrade galacto-oligosaccharides by the latter group. 
Altogether, the carbohydrate degradation in elderly was different compared to 
adults, with some carbohydrates showing decreased degradation rates. Longer 
interventions periods may be required to enhance bifidobacterial abundance in 
the microbiota of pre-frail elderly and thereby to obtain associated prebiotic 
health benefits.

BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has been regarded as one of the main healthcare 
challenges in the last century, leading to critical health problems and reduced 
life expectancy. Many factors can play a role in its development or prevention. 
Using the Trend Impact Analysis (TIA), this study aimed to conduct a 
community-based futures study for pediatric obesity in Iran.
METHODS: We obtained the prevalence of overweight and obesity from the database 
of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Moreover, we reviewed 21 
documents, texts, and comments from three key stakeholders in Iran and prepared 
a list of key experts, who were stakeholders in the field of obesity prevention 
of childhood in different organizations. Then, we collected the expert opinions 
by Delphi method. Data analysis was performed using the Excel and R software.
RESULTS: Fourteen experts participated in the first stage and nine experts in 
the second stage. We identified two positive drivers, including the prevalence 
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the widespread expansion of online 
educational programs. Meanwhile, we identified five negative drivers as follows: 
(1) controlling and limiting obesogenic environments in the community, school, 
and family; (2) running annual compulsory anthropometry programs for students of 
all educational levels in health centers; (3) integrating nutrition education 
interventions in the curricula of all educational levels; (4) taxation of 
unhealthy and fast foods; and (5) preparing safe and appropriate sports 
environments for children and adolescents (on the streets, schools, parks, and 
sports clubs). Without considering the drivers, the prevalence of overweight and 
obesity is predicted to reach 29.10% in 2031. However, it is expected that the 
negative drivers can increase the prevalence trend from 23.40% in 2018 to 19.57% 
in 2031, the positive drivers to 32.61%, and the combination of all drivers to 
23.07%.
CONCLUSION: It seems that measures such as the effective communication of policy 
makers, basic evaluation of the programs and policies related to the prevention 
of childhood obesity, and localization of the programs of international 
organizations for the prevention of obesity can greatly control the prevalence 
of childhood obesity.

BACKGROUND: The application of laparoscopic procedures in the liver surgery has 
been growing. We herein present the first case of a pediatric patient who 
underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) using a hybrid procedure
