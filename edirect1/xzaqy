INTRODUCTION: In 2007, a national review committee was instituted in The 
Netherlands to review cases of active ending of life for newborns. It was 
expected that 15-20 cases would be reported. To date, however, only one case has 
been reported to this committee. Reporting is essential to obtain societal 
control and transparency; the possible explanations for this lack of reporting 
were therefore explored.
METHODS: Data on end-of-life decision-making were scrutinised from Dutch 
nation-wide studies (1995, 2001 and 2005), before institution of the committee. 
Physicians received a questionnaire about their medical decision-making for 
stratified samples of deceased infants up to 1 year, drawn from the central 
death registry.
RESULTS: In 2005, 58% of all deaths were preceded by an end-of-life decision, 
compared with 68% in 2001 and 62% in 1995. The use of drugs with a possible 
life-shortening effect tended to be lower. In 2005, all four cases in the study 
in which an infants' life was actively ended were preceded by a decision to 
forego life-prolonging treatment. In three cases, the infant's life expectancy 
was short; one case involved a longer life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: The expected number of cases is probably an overestimation due to 
changes in medical practice such as the tendency to attribute less 
life-shortening effects to opioids. The lack of reports is probably also 
associated with requirements in the regulation; it may be difficult to fulfil 
them due either to time constraints or the nature of the suffering that is 
addressed. If societal control of active ending of life is considered useful, 
changes in the regulation may be needed.

AIM: Although the facilities for end-of-life care in the special elderly (SE) 
nursing home are increasing, there are no standard guidelines for end-of-life 
care interventions. Furthermore, in the SE nursing home, there are not enough 
data concerning those who have had end-of-life care and/or emergency hospital 
palliative therapy. Therefore, we compared the clinical outcome of end-of-life 
care patients and emergency palliative therapy patients.
PARTICIPANTS: Five end-of-life care patients (99+/-10 years old) in the SE 
nursing home, and 48 emergency palliative therapy patients (89+/-15 years old) 
in the hospitals.
RESULTS: All end-of-life care patients are still living after 300+/-70 days by 
standard nursing care (mainly fluid diets with small doses of vasodilators and 
antibiotics) with bed side music. Their average CRP values in terminal 
end-of-life care patients decreased from 10+/-12 mg/dl to 1.2+/-0.5 (p<0.05), 
serum albumin levels increased from 2.7+/-1.6 g/dl to 3.5+/-2.6 and body mass 
index increased from 16+/-1.6 to 18.3+/-0.75 (p<0.05). Among 48 emergency 
hospitalized palliative patients, 32 patients were discharged to our facility 
after 120+/-26 days of hospitalization, whereas 16 patients died in hospital 
after 100+/-36 days of hospitalization (aspiration pneumonia: 11 patients, heart 
failure: 3 patients and G-I causes: 2 patients).
CONCLUSION: End-of-life care in the SE nursing home prolonged their life 
expectancy despite centenarian status. Hospital mortality rates of palliative 
emergency therapy were higher than usual end-of-life care. These data suggest 
that end-of-life care interventions, including bed side music, could provide 
physical satisfaction.

Technologies, Uttar Pradesh, India. vnaveenshankar@gmail.com

We report a rare case of osteoglophonic dysplasia affecting father and daughter. 
Osteoglophonic dysplasia is a very rare skeletal dysplasia with 
craniosynostosis, multiple radiolucencies of bone and clinical anodontia. It is 
an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by short stature. The affected 
children have normal intelligence. Close association with missense mutation of 
fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 has been reported. Life expectancy depends 
on the degree of cranial malformation. In previous reports, bone defects usually 
resolved by adulthood, but multiple tooth impaction may cause aesthetic and 
masticatory problems. Cytogenetic studies and routine laboratory tests were all 
within normal limits.

Recovery of the main causes of death in the Northeast of Brazil: impact on life 
expectancy.

PB, Brasil. antunes@de.ufpb.br

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact on life expectancy after elimination of the 
main groups of causes of death in the Brazilian Northeast in 2000.
METHODS: Data on deaths recorded for the states of Northeastern Brazil in 2000 
were extracted from the Mortality Information System. The coverage of death 
records of children under ten years of age was assessed using indirect 
procedures. Ledermann's method was used to reclassify the ill-defined death 
causes, according to sex. Multiple-decrement life tables were constructed for 
the main groups of causes of death, whose decrement impacts were assessed 
through life expectancy.
RESULTS: The total elimination of the main groups of causes in the general 
mortality resulted in the following gains on the life expectancy of the 
Northeast for men and women, respectively: infectious and parasitic diseases 
(1.0 and 0.5 years), malignant neoplasms (1.4 and 1.5 years), circulatory 
diseases (4.0 and 4.0 years), respiratory diseases (1.1 and 0.8 years), and 
external causes (2.9 and 0.3 years).
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of death coverage were found satisfactory, as well as 
the reclassifications of ill-defined causes for the states. Considering the fact 
that the vital statistics of the Northeast have not been widely used, due to the 
argument that their quality limits derivation of reliable mortality indicators, 
their recovery in a direct way yields consistent results.

Immature development and reproductive life history of Delphastus catalinae 
(Horn) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) feeding on Bemisia tabaci biotype B 
(Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) (= B. argentifolii Bellows and Perring) 
immatures was studied at three constant temperatures: 22, 26 and 30 degrees C. 
Lower developmental threshold temperatures (T0) were estimated at 9 and 9.9 
degrees C, for males and females, respectively. Female adults weighed slightly 
more than males (0.587 and 0.505 mg, respectively). As temperature increased 
from 22 to 30 degrees C, developmental time from eggs to eclosion of the adult 
declined from 24 to 15 days. Thermal units required for immature development was 
approximately 300 degree-days. Percentage egg hatch declined at increasing 
temperatures, but no significant effect of time was found. The intrinsic rate of 
increase, r, increased from 0.048 to 0.082 and doubling time decreased from 
14.44 to 8.45 days as temperature increased from 22 to 26 degrees C. Mean daily 
fecundity was modeled as a function of time and temperature to create a 
3-dimensional surface. Overall, Delphastus catalinae was found to perform better 
at 22 and 26 degrees C while 30 degrees C was detrimental to immature 
development and adult reproduction.

IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Since the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy, 
the incidence of opportunistic infections has declined and the life expectancy 
of HIV-infected people has significantly increased. However, opportunistic 
infections, including fungal diseases, remain a leading cause of 
hospitalizations and mortality in HIV-infected people. With the availability of 
several new antiretroviral and antifungal agents, drug-drug interactions emerge 
as a potential safety concern.
AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Relevant literature was identified using a Medline 
search of articles published up to March 2010 and a review of conference 
abstracts. Search terms included HIV, antifungal agents and drug interactions. 
Original papers and relevant citations were considered for this review.
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Readers will gain an understanding of the 
pharmacokinetic properties of antiretroviral and antifungal agents, and insight 
into significant drug-drug interactions which may require dosage adjustments or 
a change in therapy.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Azole antifungal drugs, with the exception of fluconazole, 
pose the greatest risk of two-way interactions with antiretroviral drugs through 
CYP450 enzymes effects. Limited studies suggest the risk of interactions between 
antiretroviral drugs and echinocandins is much lower. The combination of 
tenofovir and amphotericin B should be used with caution and close monitoring of 
renal function is required.

Evaluating interventions to improve antiretroviral adherence: how much of an 
effect is required for favorable value?

OBJECTIVE: Uncertainty about the value of antiretroviral therapy (ARV) adherence 
interventions may be a barrier to implementation and evaluation. Our objective 
is to estimate the minimum effectiveness required for ARV adherence 
interventions to deliver acceptable value.
METHODS: We used a validated HIV computer simulation to estimate the impact of 
ARV adherence interventions on incremental costs and life expectancy. Across a 
wide range of intervention costs ($1000-10,000, one time or per year), we 
estimated the smallest effect size compatible with acceptable value (incremental 
cost-effective ratio < or =$100,000 per life-year). Effect sizes were measured 
using relative risk (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR), and these metrics 
were applied to nonadherence and nonadherence risk factors. Costs were estimated 
from a societal perspective ($2003) discounted at 3%.
RESULTS: To give acceptable value, a one-time $1000 intervention must reduce ARV 
nonadherence by RR < or = 0.82 (ARR > or = 0.04) for moderately nonadherent 
patients (20% of ARV doses missed) and RR < or = 0.90 (ARR > or = 0.05) for 
severely nonadherent patients (50% of ARV doses missed). A one-time $5000 
intervention has an unacceptable value regardless of effect size for moderately 
nonadherent patients, and must reduce ARV nonadherence by RR <or = 0.31 (ARR > 
or = 0.69) for severely nonadherent patients. Interventions aimed at behavioral 
risk factors (e.g., unhealthy alcohol use) may confer acceptable value (e.g., if 
< or = $2000 and effect RR < or = 0.71 [ARR > or = 0.29]).
CONCLUSIONS: ARV adherence interventions with plausible effect sizes may offer 
favorable value if they cost <$5000 one time or per year. ARV adherence 
interventions with a favorable value should become more integral components of 
HIV care.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of topical intranasal steroids 
for the treatment of otitis media with effusion (OME) in primary care from the 
perspective of the UK National Health Service.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted based on evidence from the 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled GPRF [General Practice Research 
Framework] Nasal Steroids for Otitis Media with Effusion (GNOME) trial. 
Participants comprised 217 children aged 4-11 years who had at least one episode 
of otitis media or related ear problem in the previous 12 months and had 
tympanometrically confirmed bilateral OME. Children were randomly allocated to 
receive either mometasone furoate 50 microg or placebo spray once daily into 
each nostril for 3 months. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for topical steroids compared with 
placebo. The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to present 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves at alternative willingness to pay 
thresholds.
RESULTS: Children receiving topical steroids accrued nonsignificantly higher 
costs (incremental cost/child: pound11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: - pound199 
to pound222) and nonsignificantly fewer QALYs (incremental QALY gain/child: 
-0.0166, 95% CI: -0.0652 to 0.0320) than those receiving placebo. Topical 
steroids had a 24.19% probability of being cost-effective at a pound20,000 per 
QALY gained threshold, a 23.82% probability of being more effective and a 46.25% 
probability of being less costly. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses showed 
incremental costs and benefits to be highly sensitive to the methods used and 
the patient group considered, although differences between groups did not reach 
statistical significance in any analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical steroids are unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment for 
OME in general practice.

Eliciting distributions to populate decision analytic models.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Health Economics, University of York, York, UK. lg116@york.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Elicitation can be used to characterize structural uncertainty 
within a decision analytic model. This allows the value of acquiring further 
evidence to resolve these uncertainties to be established.
AIM: This article demonstrated the use of expert elicitation for this purpose 
and also compared the elicited results with the results from alternative 
assumptions previously used to characterize the uncertainties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Distributions for two unknown parameters were elicited. 
These were used within a model developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
infliximab and etanercept for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 
compared with palliative care. The experts' distributions were synthesized using 
two approaches: linear pooling and random effects meta-analysis. Weighting of 
experts is also explored.
RESULTS: The four methods produce broadly similar results, and in each, the 
choice of optimum strategy is between etanercept and palliative care 
(incremental cost-effective ratio for etanercept is between pound29,021 and 
pound39,259 per costs and quality adjusted life years). Decision uncertainty, at 
a pound30,000 threshold, is high in all of the synthesis models thus generating 
high values of further research at between pound141 and pound634 million. In 
each model, the greatest value of further research was for the short-term 
effectiveness of treatment ( pound47- pound406 million).
DISCUSSION: Although the cost-effectiveness results do not differ substantially 
between the models using the elicited values and the original scenarios, there 
are some stark contrasts in terms of the values of further research generated.
CONCLUSION: Elicitation offers a feasible method to generate evidence for the 
missing information but there are a number of key issues for which further 
research is required.

Competing risk of death: an important consideration in studies of older adults.

USA. sarahberry@hrca.harvard.edu

Clinical studies often face the difficult problem of how to account for 
participants who die without experiencing the study outcome of interest. In a 
geriatric population with considerable comorbidities, the competing risk of 
death is especially high. Traditional approaches to describe risk of disease 
include Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression, 
but these methods can overestimate risk of disease by failing to account for the 
competing risk of death. This report discusses traditional survival analysis and 
competing risk analysis as used to estimate risk of disease in geriatric 
studies. Furthermore, it illustrates a competing risk approach to estimate risk 
of second hip fracture in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study and compares the 
results with traditional survival analysis. In this example, survival analysis 
overestimated the 5-year risk of second hip fracture by 37% and the 10-year risk 
by 75% compared with competing risk estimates. In studies of older individuals 
in which a substantial number of participants die during a long follow-up, the 
cumulative incidence competing risk estimate and competing risk regression 
should be used to determine incidence and effect estimates. Use of a competing 
risk approach is critical to accurately determining disease risk for elderly 
individuals and therefore best inform clinical decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening 
in men aged 80 and older in Medicare and to examine geographic variation in 
screening rates across the U.S.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of variation across hospital referral regions 
using administrative data.
SETTING: National random sample in fee-for-service Medicare.
PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries aged 80 and older in 2003.
MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of men aged 80 and older screened using the PSA test.
RESULTS: The national rate of PSA screening in men aged 80 and older was 17.2%, 
but there was wide variation across regions (<2-38%). Higher PSA screening in a 
region was positively associated with greater total costs (correlation 
coefficient (r)=0.49, P<.001), greater intensive care unit use at the end of 
life (r=0.46, P<.001), and greater number of unique physicians seen (r=0.36, 
P<.001). PSA screening was negatively associated with proportion of 
beneficiaries using a primary care physician as opposed to a medical 
subspecialist for the predominance of ambulatory care (r=-0.38, P<.001).
CONCLUSION: PSA screening in men aged 80 and older is common practice, although 
its frequency is highly variable across the United States. Its association with 
fragmented physician care and aggressive end-of-life care may reflect less 
reliance on primary care and consequent difficulty informing patients of the 
potential harms and low likelihood of benefit of this procedure.

BACKGROUND: The Neoss implant system has been available since 2004. Few studies 
documenting the clinical performance of this implant are available.
PURPOSE: To study the stability and clinical/radiographic outcomes of Neoss 
implants 1 year of loading when using a two-stage protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety (90) consecutive patients scheduled for implant 
treatment using a two-stage procedure were enrolled in a prospective follow-up 
study. A total of 218 implants (Neoss System, Bimodal surface, Neoss Ltd, 
Harrogate, UK) in diameters of 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 mm and in lengths from 7 to 15 
mm were placed to support 29 single tooth replacements, 53 partial bridges, 5 
full bridges, and 10 overdentures in both jaws. Abutment connection was made 
after a healing period of 3-4 months. The patients were followed during 1 year 
of loading with clinical, radiographic, and resonance frequency analysis 
(Osstell Mentor™, Osstell AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) examinations. Prostheses were 
removed at the annual check-up for individual testing of implant stability.
RESULTS: Three implant failures were experienced, giving a survival rate of 
98.6% after 1 year. A mean bone loss of 0.6 mm (SD 0.8) was observed after 1 
year. There was a significant inverse correlation between implant diameter and 
marginal bone loss (p < .003). The mean implant stability quotient levels were 
73.7 (SD 7.6), 74.4 (SD 6.4), and 76.7 (SD 5.2) at placement, abutment 
connection, and first annual check-up, respectively. The stability had increased 
significantly from placement to 1 year (p < .001) and from abutment to 1 year (p 
< .0001). Implant stability was higher in the mandible than in the maxilla at 
all time points. There was a significant correlation between bone quality and 
stability at placement (p < .0001) and abutment connection (p < .001) but not 
after 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of Neoss implants for prosthetic rehabilitation of 
consecutive edentate patients with different needs resulted in predictable 
clinical and radiographic outcomes after 1 year of loading. Implant stability 
measurements revealed a favorable bone tissue reaction to the implants.

Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and predominantly affects 
older men (aged >or=70 years). The median age at diagnosis is 68 years; overall, 
two-thirds of prostate cancer-related deaths occur in men aged >or=75 years. 
With the exponential ageing of the population and the increasing life-expectancy 
in developed countries, the burden of prostate cancer is expected to increase 
dramatically in the future. To date, no specific guidelines on the management of 
prostate cancer in older men have been published. The International Society of 
Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) conducted a systematic bibliographic search based on 
screening, diagnostic procedures and treatment options for localized and 
advanced prostate cancer, to develop a proposal for recommendations that should 
provide the highest standard of care for older men with prostate cancer. The 
consensus of the SIOG Prostate Cancer Task Force is that older men with prostate 
cancer should be managed according to their individual health status, which is 
mainly driven by the severity of associated comorbid conditions, and not 
according to chronological age. Existing international recommendations (European 
Association of Urology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American 
Urological Association) are the backbone for localized and advanced prostate 
cancer treatment, but need to be adapted to patient health status. Based on a 
rapid and simple evaluation, patients can be classified into four different 
groups: 1, 'Healthy' patients (controlled comorbidity, fully independent in

BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have shown that exercise therapy and spinal 
manipulation are both more effective for low back pain (LBP) than no treatment 
at all. However, the effects are at best modest. To enhance the clinical 
outcomes, recommendations are to improve the patient selection process, and to 
identify relevant subgroups to guide clinical decision-making. One of the 
systems that has potentials to improve clinical decision-making is a 
treatment-based classification system that is intended to identify those 
patients who are most likely to respond to direction-specific exercises, 
manipulation, or stabilisation exercises.
METHODS/DESIGN: The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial will be to 
assess the effectiveness of a classification-based system. A sample of 150 
patients with subacute and chronic LBP who attend a private physical therapy 
clinic for treatment will be recruited. At baseline, all participants will 
undergo a standard evaluation by trained research physical therapists and will 
be classified into one of the following subgroups: direction-specific exercises, 
manipulation, or stabilisation. The patient will not be informed about the 
results of the examination. Patients will be randomly assigned to 
classification-based treatment or usual care according to the Dutch LBP 
guidelines, and will complete questionnaires at baseline, and 8, 26, and 52 
weeks after the start of the treatment. The primary outcomes will be general 
perceived recovery, functional status, and pain intensity. Alongside this trial, 
an economic evaluation of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility will be conducted 
from a societal perspective.
DISCUSSION: The present study will contribute to our knowledge about the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of classification-based treatment in 
patients with LBP.

An entomological survey was conducted in Cameroon between October 2004 and 
September 2005, in nine localities targeted for malaria vector control based on 
adult productivity and variability. Mosquitoes were collected by human-landing 
catches (HLCs) and pyrethrum spray catches. A total of 12 500 anophelines were 
collected and dissected: Anopheles gambiae s.l. (56.86%), An. funestus s.l. 
(32.57%), An. hancocki (9.38%), and An. nili (1.18%). Applying PCR revealed that 
specimens of the An. funestus group were An. funestus s.s. and An. gambiae 
complex were mostly An. melas and An. gambiae s.s. of the M and S molecular 
forms with the M forms being the most predominant. The natural distribution 
patterns of Anopheles species were largely determined by altitude with some 
species having unique environmental tolerance limits. A human blood index (HBI) 
of 99.05% was recorded. Mean probability of daily survival of the malaria 
vectors was 0.92, with annual mean life expectancy of 21.9 days and the 
expectation of infective life was long with a mean of 7.4 days. The high 
survival rates suggest a high vector potential for the species. This information 
enhances the development of a more focused and informed vector control 
intervention.

Pseudomonas or LPS exposure alters CFTR iodide efflux in 2WT2 epithelial cells 
with time and dose dependence.

The most common heritable genetic disease in the United States, cystic fibrosis 
(CF), is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR), a chloride channel that interacts with and regulates a number of other 
proteins. The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa infects 80% of patients causing 
decreased pulmonary function and life expectancy. It is not known how 
malfunction of the chloride channel allows for preferential colonization of 
patients by a single pathogen. The hypothesis that CFTR interacts with toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) to phagocytize bacteria was tested. A competitive antagonist 
of TLR4, MKLPS, was studied for its effect in gentamicin-protection-based 
bacterial invasion assays. Pre-incubation (15 min 50 microg/mL) with MKLPS did 
not alter the rate of phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by cultured epithelia. 
However, further studies with GFP-transfected P. aeruginosa revealed prominent 
antibiotic resistant microcolonies were formed. If CFTR is involved in 
phagocytosis of the bacteria, then internalization was predicted to decrease in 
iodide efflux. Surprisingly, cultured epithelia exposed to P. aeruginosa for 15 
min showed increased cAMP-activated iodide efflux through CFTR. In addition, 
15-min exposure to bacterial cell wall component, LPS, purified from P. 
aeruginosa also increased CFTR iodide efflux in a dose-dependent manner (50, 100 
and 200 microg/mL LPS had 25%, 37% and 47% increase). In a reversal of this 
phenomenon, shorter 5-min exposure to 100 microg/mL LPS resulted in a 25% 
decrease in forskolin-activated CFTR channel activity compared to controls. This 
data is consistent with a model in which CFTR is removed from the plasma 
membrane during phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa followed by recruitment of 
channels to the membrane to replace those removed during phagocytosis. More 
studies are needed to confirm this model, but this is the first report of a 
bacterial product causing a biphasic time-dependent and a dose-dependent 
alteration of CFTR channel activity.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease 
that mainly targets the cholangiocytes of the interlobular bile ducts in the 
liver. The condition primarily affects middle-aged women. Without treatment, PBC 
generally progresses to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure over a period of 
10-20 years. PBC is a rare disease with prevalence of less than 1/2000. PBC is 
thought to result from a combination of multiple genetic factors and 
superimposed environmental triggers. The contribution of the genetic 
predisposition is evidenced by the familial clustering. Several risk factors, 
including exposure to infectious agents and chemical xenobiotics, have been 
suggested. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only FDA-approved 
medical treatment for PBC. When administered at doses of 13-15 mg/kg/day, a 
majority of patients with PBC have a normal life expectancy without additional 
therapeutic measures. One out of three patients does not adequately respond to 
UDCA therapy and may need additional medical therapy and/or liver 
transplantation. This review summarises current knowledge on the epidemiology, 
ethiopathogenesis, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of PBC.

Analytic model comparing the cost utility of TVT versus duloxetine in women with 
urinary stress incontinence.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to assess cost 
utility of duloxetine versus tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) as a second-line 
treatment for urinary stress incontinence.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the cost utility based on a 2-year 
follow-up period. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation was performed by 
assuming a disutility rate of 0.05.
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, although duloxetine was a cheaper option, 
TVT gave a considerably higher QALY gain. When a longer follow-up period was 
considered, TVT had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound 
7,710 ($12,651) at 10 years. If the QALY gain from cure was 0.09, then the ICER 
for duloxetine and TVT would both fall within the indicative National Institute 
for Health and Clinical Excellence willingness to pay threshold at 2 years, but 
TVT would be the cost-effective option having extended dominance over 
duloxetine.
CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that TVT is a cost-effective treatment for 
stress incontinence.

Diabetes and its impact on health-related quality of life: a life table 
analysis.

PURPOSE: To investigate the health burden of diabetes and determine its impact 
on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a population with a high prevalence 
of chronic conditions.
METHODS: A representative sample of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador (NL) was used to estimate prevalence of diabetes and mean health 
utility index (HUI), a utility-based measure of HRQOL. Diabetes-deleted life 
expectancy (LE) and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) were derived to 
measure HRQOL.
RESULTS: Diabetic individuals comprised 6.8% of the sample and accounted for 14% 
of total deaths from 2001 to 2005. Life Expectancy at age 15 was 61.3 years for 
men and 66.7 years for women, of which 53.0 and 57.0 years, respectively, were 
spent with perfect health (86.4 and 85.5%). Eliminating diabetes would extend 
both the overall LE and HALE for men by 1.3 and 1.4 years, and women by 2.0 and 
1.7 years, respectively. People with diabetes had a significantly lower HRQOL 
than people without diabetes (mean HUI: 0.78 vs. 0.88, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The burden of illness from diabetes in NL is considerable. Using 
cause-eliminated LE and HALE provides a robust approach for assessing HRQOL that 
may have important implications for diabetes surveillance, prevention, and 
management strategies.

Cost-effectiveness of switching to biphasic insulin aspart from human premix 
insulin in a US setting.

Allschwil, Switzerland. jpalmer@ch.imshealth.com

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of switching to biphasic insulin 
aspart (BIAsp 30) from human premix insulin for type 2 diabetes patients in the 
United States (US) setting.
METHODS: The previously published and validated IMS Core Diabetes Model was used 
to project life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and costs 
over 30 years. Patient characteristics and treatment effects were based on 
Canadian patients included the IMPROVE observational study (n = 311). Mean 
glycohaemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was 8.4%, duration of diabetes 16 years and 
prevalence of complications high at baseline. Simulations were conducted from 
the perspective of a third-party payer, with costs accounted in 2008 US dollars 
($).
RESULTS: BIAsp 30 was projected to improve life expectancy by 0.202 years and 
QALE by 0.301 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), due to a reduced incidence of 
most diabetes-related complications. BIAsp 30 was associated with increased 
lifetime direct medical costs ($76,517 vs. 67,518) and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $29,870 per QALY gained. Long-term outcomes were 
sensitive to the impact of BIAsp 30 on hypoglycaemia and changes in HbA(1c).
CONCLUSIONS: BIAsp 30 may represent a cost-effective treatment option in the US 
setting for advanced type 2 diabetes patients experiencing poor glycaemic 
control or hypoglycaemia on human premix insulin.
LIMITATIONS: The application of treatment effect data derived from a Canadian 
cohort to the US setting was a limitation of the cost-effectiveness analysis. 
The findings of this cost-effectiveness analysis are not applicable to 
insulin-naïve diabetes patients.

BACKGROUND: Male life expectancy in the Russian Federation, at 60 years, is the 
lowest in Europe. Several factors contribute to this situation, but hazardous 
consumption of alcohol is especially a key factor.
METHODS: We undertook a stakeholder analysis in a typical Russian region located 
on the western side of the Urals. Organizations with a stake in alcohol policy 
in the region were identified by snowball sampling and information on their 
position and influence on alcohol policy was elicited from interviews with key 
informants. Their interests and influence were mapped and their relationships 
plotted.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine stakeholder organizations were identified and 43 interviews 
were conducted with their staff. The most influential actors were the Federal 
and regional governments, large beer producers and manufacturers of strong 
alcohols. However, the majority of organizations that might be expected to play 
a role in developing or implementing alcohol control policies were almost 
entirely disengaged and fragmented. No evidence was found of an existing or 
emerging multi-sectoral coalition for developing alcohol policy to improve 
health. Organizations that might be expected to contribute to tackling hazardous 
drinking had little understanding of what might be effective.
CONCLUSIONS: While stakeholders with an interest in maintaining or increasing 
alcohol consumption are engaged and influential, those who might seek to reduce 
it either take a very narrow perspective or are disengaged from the policy 
agenda. There is a need to mobilize actors who might contribute to effective 
policies while challenging those who can block them.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the gender differences of patients undergoing 
aortic valve replacement (AVR) for isolated severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 408 consecutive patients (215 women and 193 men; p=0.9) 
were analysed. At presentation, women were older (73.7+/-9.3 years vs men 
66.5+/-11.5 years; p<0.001), more symptomatic (New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
class: women 2.3+/-0.7 vs men 2.0+/-0.65; p<0.001), and presented with smaller 
valve areas (women 0.6+/-0.2 cm(2) vs men 0.7+/-0.2 cm(2); p<0.001) and higher 
mean pressure gradients (women 67.3+/-19.2 mm Hg vs men 62.2+/-20.0 mm Hg, 
p=0.001). Despite older age and more advanced disease in women, operative 
mortality did not differ. Survival after AVR by Kaplan-Meier analysis tended to 
be even better in women (92.8%, 89.8%, 81.4% vs men 89.1%, 86.6%, 76.3% at 1, 2 
and 5 years, p=0.31). After division into age quintiles, the outcome of women 
was significantly better in patients older than 79 years (p=0.005). After 
adjustment for clinical characteristics, gender did not predict operative 
mortality and late outcome. Despite physical improvement in both groups after 
surgery, women remained more symptomatic (NYHA class: women 1.6+/-0.7 vs men 
1.3+/-0.4; p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Although women referred to AVR are older and more symptomatic, 
operative and long-term mortality are not increased. In the oldest age group of 
79 years and older, women even have a better outcome, presumably due to a longer 
mean life expectancy.

The Editorial Board of Aging reviews research papers published in 2009, which 
they believe have or will have significant impact on aging research. Among many 
others, the topics include genes that accelerate aging or in contrast promote 
longevity in model organisms, DNA damage responses and telomeres, molecular 
mechanisms of life span extension by calorie restriction and pharmacological 
interventions into aging. The emerging message in 2009 is that aging is not 
random but determined by a genetically-regulated longevity network and can be 
decelerated both genetically and pharmacologically.

BACKGROUND: Diet is one of the most important lifestyle factors that a affect 
healthy life expectancy through onset of various lifestyle-related diseases. 
Large-scale cohort studies with sufficient baseline nutritional information are 
scarce. NIPPON DATA80/90 is cohort study of representative Japanese population, 
and the cohorts also participated in the National Nutrition Survey in Japan 
(NNSJ) at the baseline. The corresponding datasets could be combined.
METHODS: Individual records of NIPPON DATA and NNSJ were compared and 
integrated. Intakes of nutrients and food groups for individual participants 
were calculated by distributing intakes in the each household in NNSJ, 
considering age and sex of the individuals. The results from an international 
cooperative epidemiological study (INTERMAP) were utilized to estimate intakes 
of 75 nutrients for NNSJ80 and 70 nutrients for NNSJ90. Nutrient intakes 
calculated utilizing INTERMAP data were compared with those in the NNSJ 
datasets.
RESULTS: NIPPON DATA80/90 datasets were enhanced with detailed baseline nutrient 
intake data (the numbers of participants combined were 10,422 and 8342 for 
NIPPON DATA80 and 90, respectively). The mean nutrient intakes calculated 
through utilizing INTEMRAP data and those calculated from the NNSJ datasets were 
similar, and the calculated values were strongly correlated with those 
calculated from NNSJ datasets (Pearson's correlation coefficients greater than 
0.8 [P < 0.001]). Detailed nutrient intakes (eg, cholesterol, fatty acids, amino 
acids, and dietary fiber) were complemented.
CONCLUSIONS: The nutrient intakes calculated from NNSJ datasets for the 
participants of NIPPON DATA are appropriate as the baseline nutrient intake 
data. The enhanced cohort datasets are suitable for investigations of baseline 
dietary habits and the consequent health status.

Aortic disease is the main cause of death among patients with Marfan syndrome. 
Before the development of open surgery, most patients died in the fourth decade 
of life. Improvements in surgical techniques have facilitated prophylactic 
surgery and have dramatically changed the life expectancy of patients with 
Marfan syndrome. Valve-sparing techniques are becoming the standard surgical 
treatment for these patients, since the operative and long-term results are 
comparable with those obtained with the Bentall and De Bono procedure and their 
theoretical advantages over the Bentall and De Bono procedure are attractive for 
young patients. Distal aortic complications still cause substantial morbidity in 
patients who have undergone surgery. On the other hand, several medical 
approaches have appeared as alternatives or adjuncts to the standard treatment 
with beta-blockers. Mouse models of the disease have shown that the angiotensin 
II receptor blocker losartan can rescue the phenotype. Among female patients, 
pregnancy deserves special consideration. Aortic dissection occurs mainly in the 
third trimester of gestation and in patients with dilated aortas. As aortic 
dissection carries a high risk of maternal mortality and fetal demise, 
prophylactic aortic surgery is recommended before attempting pregnancy for those 
women with an aortic diameter exceeding 40 mm.
