complementing this doctorate); practice in the field of the psychologist's job 
(during at least 10 years full-time, followed by the possibility of becoming 
practitioner-teacher-researcher in psychology, in the sector of experiments and 
acquired competences, if the candidate is selected at aggregation); ability to 
teach and capacity to train the future psychologists for the professional acts 
they will be susceptible to conduct; capacity to conceive, initiate, carry out, 
direct and communicate useful research. Recruiting all psychology teachers in 
the stock of professional psychologists who are experienced, talented, skilled 
and who perform in all the application fields of the discipline as 
practitioner-teacher-researcher, is vital to implement these essential 
improvements in psychologists' training, exercise and research. It is therefore 
a priority for the future of French and European psychologists to set up as fast 
as possible a reformed doctorate and an aggregation (or, with regard to the 
aggregation, an equivalent formalised cursus); it is the common interest of 
psychology professionals, of their trainers and even more so of their users 
(people or institutions). This reform, based on the excellence of training and 
services offered, would also make it possible to preserve the essential unity of 
discipline and profession beyond the multiplicity of their sectors of 
application and intervention. It would also facilitate possibilities for 
insertion, for change of sector in career course and for professional 
geographical mobility. It would finally clarify the "psy" nebula for users, 
which is very important and necessary.
CONCLUSION: It is more than ever essential to develop and update in excellence 
the high level "psy" generalist profession, the profession of psychologist, 
which users need in many fields of their private, professional or social life. 
We should guarantee that European Union countries, eager for development and 
modernity, will rapidly be able to initiate this type of good sense reform, 
which, by improving care for people and collective balance, would be a new and 
important step in their humanistic traditions (according to the World Health 
Organization, one person out of four is in psychological distress). Since 
psychism and human behaviour are complex and central in all fields of life, the 
existence of highly qualified psychologists to help them is imperative. Reaching 
this high level of updated qualification is technically possible and humanly 
impossible to avoid. Fast reforms must make this requirement achievable. It is 
in the interest of all the European Union, and all its member states must become 
a reference and an example in the world for teaching and professional practise 
of what has become a key discipline: psychology.

STUDY DESIGN: Decision analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the best treatment for nonspecific neck pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In Canada and the United States, the most commonly 
prescribed neck pain treatments are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), exercise, and manual therapy. Deciding which treatment is best is 
difficult because of the trade-offs between beneficial and harmful effects, and 
because of the uncertainty of these effects.
METHODS: (Quality-adjusted) life expectancy associated with standard NSAIDs, 
Cox-2 NSAIDs, exercise, mobilization, and manipulation were compared in a 
decisionanalytic model. Estimates of the course of neck pain, background risk of 
adverse events in the general population, treatment effectiveness and risk, and 
patient-preferences were input into the model. Assuming equal effectiveness, we 
conducted a baseline analysis using risk of harm only. We assessed the stability 
of the baseline results by conducting a second analysis that incorporated 
effectiveness data from a high-quality randomized trial.
RESULTS: There were no important differences across treatments. The difference 
between the highest and lowest ranked treatments predicted by the baseline model 
was 4.5 days of life expectancy and 3.4 quality-adjusted life-days. The 
difference between the highest and lowest ranked treatments predicted by the 
second model was 7.3 quality-adjusted life-days.
CONCLUSION: When the objective is to maximize life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, none of the treatments in our analysis were 
clearly superior.

Posterior capsule opacification and neodymium:YAG laser capsulotomy rates with a 
round-edged silicone and a sharp-edged hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens 10 
years after surgery.

PURPOSE: To compare posterior capsule opacification (PCO) and neodymium:YAG 
(Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy rates 10 years after surgery between two 3-piece 
intraocular lenses (IOLs): a silicone IOL with round optic edges and a 
hydrophobic acrylic IOL with sharp optic edges.
SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna 
General Hospital, Vienna, Austria.
METHODS: Patients having had cataract surgery and implantation of at least 1 
study IOL by the same surgeon between 1994 and 1999 were retrospectively 
examined. The number of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomies performed was noted. The PCO 
intensity was assessed using digital retroilluminated photographs and Automated 
Quantification of After-Cataract (AQUA) software. The AQUA scores in eyes with 
Nd:YAG capsulotomy were estimated with a multiple-imputation procedure. Anterior 
capsule opacification (ACO) and fibrotic PCO were graded subjectively at the 
slitlamp.
RESULTS: The study evaluated 143 eyes (98 patients). Eight (18%) of 44 eyes with 
a silicone IOL and 41 (42%) of 99 eyes with an acrylic IOL had Nd:YAG 
capsulotomy after 10 years (P = .007). The AQUA scores were lower with the 
silicone IOLs. The median difference in AQUA scores was significantly different 
after missing values of the Nd:YAG capsulotomies were imputed. There was no 
difference in ACO. There was more fibrotic PCO with round-edged silicone IOLs 
than with sharp-edged acrylic IOLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Ten years after surgery, acrylic IOLs seemed to lose their PCO 
preventive effect, despite their sharp optic edges. The increasingly longer life 
expectancy and earlier cataract surgery mandate reconsideration of preferences 
regarding optic materials and design elements of IOLs.

York, NY 10032, USA. hj2198@columbia.edu

BACKGROUND: We developed an estimation equation of EuroQol EQ-5D index scores 
from the Healthy Days measures of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
for use in burden of disease and cost-effectiveness studies in population 
subgroups. This study estimated EQ-5D scores, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for the USA and the 
individual states.
METHODS: We estimated the EQ-5D scores for respondents from the 2000-2003 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We calculated QALYs and QALE lost to 
morbidity due to obesity/overweight, smoking, low income and chronic diseases.
RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D score for US adults was 0.870. The mean scores ranged 
from 0.826 (West Virginia) to 0.902 (Hawaii). Smoking contributed from 5.6 
(Utah) to 12.3 (Kentucky) percent, obesity/overweight 5.4 (South Dakota) to 13.8 
(Louisiana) percent, low income 16.6 (Hawaii) to 39.9 (South Carolina) percent 
and chronic diseases 8.7 (Minnesota) to 22.9 (Tennessee) percent of explainable 
QALYs lost. These risks contributed the greatest proportion of explainable QALYs 
and QALE lost in Kentucky, Tennessee and South Carolina.
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated the burden of disease contributed by selected risk 
factors. Currently, such data are unavailable but are needed to set targets for 
reducing modifiable health risks and eliminating health disparities among 
at-risk populations.

Information disclosure to terminally ill patients and their relatives: 
self-reported practice of Belgian clinical specialists and general 
practitioners.

Brussel, End-of-Life Care Research Group, Brussels, Belgium.

Objective of this study is to examine physicians' practices regarding 
information disclosure to terminally ill patients and to their relatives, 
without informing the patient. A questionnaire had been sent to a random sample 
of 3014 Belgian physicians from different specialties frequently involved in 
end-of-life care. Responses were analysed using weighted percentages, 
Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U-tests and a multivariate ordinal logistic regression. 
Response rate was 58%. Both clinical specialists and general practitioners (GPs) 
discuss most topics related to terminal illness with their patients except 
end-of-life hastening options, spirituality, life expectancy and options to 
withhold/withdraw life-sustaining treatment. The topics which most physicians 
always discuss with relatives without informing the patient are the aim of 
treatment, palliative care and incurability. There is a significant difference 
between clinical specialists and GPs. Clinical specialists and GPs discuss most 
end-of-life topics with the patient but omit important issues such as 
end-of-life hastening options and life-expectancy.

population-based cohort.

BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread use of highly effective contraceptive methods 
in France, one in every three pregnancies is unintended. Among women 
experiencing an unintended pregnancy leading to an abortion, half had changed 
their contraceptive method in the 6 months preceding the abortion, in most cases 
switching to a less-effective method or to no method at all. This study provides 
estimates of method-specific contraceptive discontinuation rates for any reason 
and for method-related reasons among French women.
METHODS: The data were drawn from the COCON survey (2000-2004), a 
population-based French prospective cohort, comprising a representative sample 
of 2863 women aged 18-44. We estimated Kaplan-Meier life-table probabilities of 
contraceptive discontinuation during the 4 years of follow-up and tested for 
differences by intrauterine device (IUD) type and pill composition.
RESULTS: Probabilities of contraceptive discontinuation for method-related 
reasons varied widely by method: IUDs were associated with the lowest 
probabilities of discontinuation (11% within 12 months, 30% within 4 years), 
followed by the pill (22% and 48%, respectively). Discontinuation rates were 
significantly higher for all other methods (condoms, withdrawal, fertility 
awareness methods and spermicides). We found no differences in discontinuation 
rates by the type of IUD (levonorgestrel-IUD versus copper-IUD) and increasing 
rates of pill discontinuation with decreasing dosage in estrogen.
CONCLUSIONS: Contraceptive discontinuation rates among French women are 
substantially lower than those reported for US women. Comparing the determinants 
of contraceptive discontinuation and the role of healthcare providers in helping 
women make these changes would improve our understanding of the reasons for such 
variation.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-utility of the 
treatment, starting with EFZ-based therapy, compared with NVP-based therapy in 
Thai HIV/AIDS patients.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study adopted a health care provider perspective. A 
probabilistic Markov model was applied to Thai HIV/AIDS patients aged 15 to 65 
years. Input parameters were extracted from a cohort study of four regional 
hospitals. The study explored the effects of uncertainty around input 
parameters.
RESULTS: For those patients with a different baseline CD4, initial therapy using 
EFZ-based regimens was the preferable choice for all subgroups. Given a maximum 
acceptable willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 300,000 Baht/DALY averted 
starting with EFZ-based regimens was cost-effective for patients with a baseline 
CD4 count less than 250 cells/mm3 and in all patient age groups, except those 
who were 20 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that starting with EFZ-based regimens was the 
preferable choice and it should be used as the first line regimen for Thai 
HIV/AIDS patients.

Demographic changes in multigeneration Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: 
Plutellidae) after exposure to sublethal concentrations of spinosad.

Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 12 Zhongguangcun Nandajie, Beijing 100081, 
China.

The sublethal effects of the insecticide spinosad were assessed against Plutella 
xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) by using a demographic approach. The 
resulting data were analyzed based on the age-stage and two-sex life table 
model. Bioassay results showed that the susceptibility of P. xylostella to 
spinosad decreased in Sub strains selected by LC25 spinosad for 10 generations. 
Although the egg size was significantly smaller in Sub-1 (selected by LC25 
spinosad for one generation) compared with spinosad-susceptible strain SS, egg 
size recovered to normal levels in Sub-5 (selected by LC25 spinosad for five 
generations) and were even larger in Sub-10 (selected by LC25 spinosad for 10 
generations). The life-history parameters changed in the Sub strains of 
different generations. Sublethal spinosad had a significant effect on Sub-1; 
however, the sublethal effect on the Sub strains decreased as selection cycles 
increased. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), finite rate of increase 
(lambda) and net reproductive rate (R(o)) in Sub-1 were significantly decreased 
compared with those in the SS strain. No significant differences were found 
between the Sub-5 or Sub-10 compared with the SS strain. The greatest difference 
was observed in the total number of eggs laid by each female, i.e., the 
fecundity. The fecundity in SS, Sub-1, Sub-5, and Sub-10 were 121.92, 81.26, 
114.42, and 159.21, respectively. The life expectancy of an SS, Sub-1, Sub-5, 
and Sub-10 egg was 10.58, 8.71, 10.21, and 7.45 d, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed trends in survival to old age and identified the 
factors associated with longevity among the elderly (age > or = 65 years).
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort analysis of demographic surveillance data.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Butajira Rural Health Programme 
Demographic Surveillance Site in Ethiopia. Using data collected between 1987 and 
2004, the probability of survival to 65 years and remaining life expectancy for 
women and men aged 65 years were computed. Cox regression analysis was used to 
assess survival by different factors.
RESULTS: Although the elderly represented 3% of the population, their 
person-time contribution increased by 48% over the 18-year period. Less than 
half reached 65 years of age, with remaining life expectancy at 65 years ranging 
from 15 years in rural men to 19 years in urban women. Rural residence, 
illiteracy and widowhood were associated with lower survival adjusted for other 
factors, whereas gender did not show a significant difference. However, the 
effect of these factors differed between men and women, as demonstrated by 
survival curves and Cox regression. Widowhood [hazard ratio (HR) 2.02, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.59-2.57] and illiteracy (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.86-2.73) 
affected males to a greater extent than females, and rural residence was 
associated with poorer female survival (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.55-1.83).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of elderly people is increasing in Ethiopia, with the 
chance of survival into older age being similar between men and women and 
approaching that in developed countries. However, rural women and illiterate 
women and men, particularly widowers, are disadvantaged in terms of survival.

Cost-effectiveness of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement used in primary total 
hip arthroplasty.

Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA. jcummins.md@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is infrequently used in the 
United States for primary total hip arthroplasty because of concerns about cost, 
performance, and the possible development of antibiotic resistance and because 
it has been approved only for use in revision arthroplasty after infection. The 
purpose of this study was to model the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement 
in primary total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of osteoarthritis to 
determine whether use of the cement is cost-effective when compared with the use 
of cement without antibiotics.
METHODS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each strategy, we used a Markov 
decision model to tabulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
accumulated by each patient. Rates of revision due to infection and aseptic 
loosening were estimated from data in the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register and 
were used to determine the probability of undergoing a revision arthroplasty 
because of either infection or aseptic loosening. The primary outcome measure 
was either all revisions or revision due to infection. Perioperative mortality 
rates, utilities, and disutilities were estimated from data in the arthroplasty 
literature. Costs for primary arthroplasty were estimated from data on 
in-hospital resource use in the literature. The additional cost of using 
antibiotic-impregnated bone cement ($600) was then added to the average cost of 
the initial procedure ($21,654).
RESULTS: When all revisions were considered to be the primary outcome measure, 
the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement was found to result in a decrease 
in overall cost of $200 per patient. When revision due to infection was 
considered to be the primary outcome measure, the use of the cement was found to 
have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $37,355 per QALY compared with 
cement without antibiotics; this cost-effectiveness compares favorably with that 
of accepted medical procedures. When only revision due to infection was 
considered, it was found that the additional cost of the antibiotic-impregnated 
bone cement would need to exceed $650 or the average patient age would need to 
be greater than seventy-one years before its cost would exceed $50,000 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: When revision due to either infection or aseptic loosening is 
considered to be the primary outcome, the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone 
cement results in an overall cost decrease. When only revision due to infection 
is considered, the model is strongly influenced by the cost of the cement and 
the average age of the patients. With few patients less than seventy years of 
age undergoing total hip arthroplasty with cement in the United States, the use 
of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement in primary total hip arthroplasty may be 
of limited value unless its cost is substantially reduced.

Patient anxiety about prostate cancer independently predicts early initiation of 
androgen deprivation therapy for biochemical cancer recurrence in older men: a 
prospective cohort study.

University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. wdale@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu

PURPOSE: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is first-line therapy for patients 
with prostate cancer (PCA) who experience biochemical recurrence (BCR). However, 
the optimal timing of ADT initiation is uncertain, and earlier ADT initiation 
can cause toxicities that lower quality of life (QOL). We tested the hypothesis 
that elevated cancer anxiety leads to earlier ADT initiation for BCR in older 
men.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of older patients 
with BCR of PCA (n = 67). Patients completed questionnaires at presentation and 
each follow-up visit until initiation of ADT. PCA-specific anxiety was measured 
with the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC). Other collected 
data included demographics, clinical information, and general anxiety 
information. Treating oncologists were surveyed about their recommendations for 
ADT initiation. The primary outcome was the time to ADT initiation. Univariate, 
multivariate logistic regression, and time-to-event analyses were conducted to 
evaluate whether cancer anxiety was a predictor of earlier initiation of ADT.
RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of patients initiated ADT at the first or second 
clinic visit. Elevated PCA anxiety (MAX-PC > 16) was the most robust predictor 
in multivariate analyses of early initiation (odds ratio [OR], 9.19; P = .01). 
PSA also independently correlated with early initiation (OR, 1.31; P = .01). PSA 
did not correlate with MAX-PC.
CONCLUSION: Cancer anxiety independently and robustly predicts earlier ADT 
initiation in older men with BCR. For older patients with PCA, earlier ADT 
initiation may not change life expectancy and can negatively impact QOL. 
PCA-specific anxiety is a potential target for a decision-making intervention in 
this setting.

Mutations in two zinc-cluster proteins activate alternative respiratory and 
gluconeogenic pathways and restore senescence in long-lived respiratory mutants 
of Podospora anserina.

In Podospora anserina, inactivation of the respiratory chain results in a 
spectacular life-span extension. This inactivation is accompanied by the 
induction of the alternative oxidase. Although the functional value of this 
response is evident, the mechanism behind it is far from understood. By 
screening suppressors able to reduce the life-span extension of 
cytochrome-deficient mutants, we identified mutations in two zinc-cluster 
proteins, RSE2 and RSE3, which are conserved in other ascomycetes. These 
mutations led to the overexpression of the genes encoding the alternative 
oxidase and the gluconeogenic enzymes, fructose-1, 6 biphosphatase, and pyruvate 
carboxykinase. Both RSE2 and RSE3 are required for the expression of these 
genes. We also show that, even in the absence of a respiratory deficiency, the 
wild-type RSE2 and RSE3 transcription factors are involved in life-span control 
and their inactivation retards aging. These data are discussed with respect to 
aging, the regulation of the alternative oxidase, and carbon metabolism.

On the welfare theoretic foundation of cost-effectiveness analysis-the case when 
survival is not affected.

Comment in
    Eur J Health Econ. 2010 Dec;11(6):595-6; discussion 597-8.

This paper develops a welfare theoretic foundation for cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA) when survival is not affected. With this foundation, all costs 
and their corresponding utility-terms should be included. A key question, 
though, is whether these utility-terms are consistent with quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) (utility) theory or not. The results show that health care costs and 
changes in the utility of health should be included. However, as QALYs do not 
capture the utility of changes in consumption (as this utility must be 
independent of health, according to QALY theory), the corresponding changes in 
consumption costs should be excluded. Regarding the costs for changes in absence 
from work, these should only be included if the utility of changes in the amount 
of leisure is included. As no QALY theory has been developed that includes this 
utility, it is unclear how to handle these costs (even if there are arguments 
for excluding them). For changes in productivity at work, though, there are 
robust arguments for the inclusion of these costs. Overall, it seems difficult 
to provide a clear basis for CEA in economic welfare theory when also including 
non-medical goods such as consumption and leisure.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variants of the warfarin sensitivity gene CYP2C9 have been 
associated with increased bleeding risk during warfarin initiation. Studies also 
suggest that such patients remain at risk throughout treatment.
OBJECTIVE: Would testing patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) for 
CYP2C9 before initiating warfarin improve outcomes?
DESIGN: Markov state transition decision model.
SETTING: Ambulatory or inpatient settings necessitating new initiation of 
anticoagulation.
PATIENTS: The base case was a 69-year-old man with newly diagnosed non-valvular 
AF. Interventions included: (1) warfarin, (2) aspirin, or (3) no antithrombotic 
therapy without genetic testing; and genetic testing followed by (4) aspirin or 
(5) no antithrombotic therapy in those with culprit CYP2C9 alleles.
MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: In the base case, testing and treating patients with CYP2C9*2 and/or 
CYP2C9*3 with aspirin rather than warfarin was best (8.97 QALYs). However, 
warfarin without genetic testing was a close second (8.96 QALYs), a difference 
of roughly 5 days. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that genetic testing 
followed by aspirin was best for patients at lower risk of embolic events. 
Warfarin without testing was preferred if the rate of embolic events was greater 
than 5% per year, or the risk of major bleeding while receiving warfarin was 
lower.
CONCLUSION: For patients at average risk for ischemic stroke due to AF and at 
average risk for major hemorrhage, treatment based on genetic testing offers no 
benefit compared to warfarin initiation without testing. The gain from testing 
may be larger in patients at lower risk of embolic events or at greater risk of 
bleeding.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-utility analysis on recombinant human 
erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for treating anemic cancer patients induced by 
chemotherapy compared to blood transfusion alone under the Thai health care 
setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A health care provider's perspective was used to examine 
relevant costs and outcomes using the Markov model. Cost data were estimated 
based on the reference price set by the Ministry of Public Health. The 
effectiveness data were obtained from a systematic review of published 
literature. The results were presented in terms of incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai Baht per Quality Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs) gained. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis method was performed.
RESULTS: The ICERs of rHuEPO compared to blood transfusion alone were 3.7 and 
2.7 millions Baht per QALY for patients with hemoglobin less than 8 g/dl and 8-9 
g/dl, respectively. The rHuEPO required additional resources (more costly) with 
less benefit compared to blood transfusion for patients with hemoglobin 9-10 
g/dl.
CONCLUSIONS: The rHuEPO may be cost-ineffective for the treatment of anemia 
caused by chemotherapy in cancer patients in Thailand.

Resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene, a kind of polyphenolic compounds, 
found in a limited number of plant species such as grape, peanut, and pine. It 
has been considered as a phytoalexin in plants, and many studies have also shown 
its health benefits such as antioxidant activities, cancer prevention, blood 
thinning, and life span extension. This paper reviews the characteristics of 
resveratrol in aspects of synthesis, extraction, purification, and 
determination. In particular, the new outcomes of physiology function and the 
transgenic approaches have been presented. The challenges and chances for 
genetic engineering and health-related industries were also discussed.

Incidence rates have long been used to assess the burden of different diseases 
in a population, whereas loss due to occurrence of diseases is studied using the 
death rates. Death rates however, are based on and therefore describe, only 
number of lives lost. There have been two approaches to arrive at the actual 
loss or gain from a particular cause viz. Person years of life lost (PYLL) 
approach and cause elimination life table (CELT) approach. This review covers 
these approaches and the competing risk theory and models focusing on the 
methodological developments. A summary of the conceptual and methodological 
developments on these concepts has also been presented. There are eight possible 
approaches in dealing with the loss in the presence or gain in the absence of a 
particular cause of death depending upon the preferences related to PYLL/CELT 
approach, modeling/descriptive approach, considering or without considering 
competing causes. A close look at the two basic approaches reveals that PYLL and 
cause elimination are just different terminologies used to address the same 
quantity, loss in the presence or gain in the absence. As far as descriptive vs. 
modeling approaches are concerned, all the descriptive procedures can be put in 
the form of models and all the models can be presented in a descriptive way. 
Regarding results using different models, no practical difference exists in the 
results based on different models for competing risks. However, exclusion of the 
competing risks may result in a considerable bias in the developing countries 
where general mortality is relatively higher. This review study suggests freedom 
in the selection of a modeling or a descriptive approach without any 
considerable loss of accuracy but at the same time emphasizes the consideration 
of the competing risks. An empirical study may be recommended to confirm the 
conclusions of this study.

BACKGROUND: Health impact assessments (HIA) use information on exposure, 
baseline mortality/morbidity and exposure-response functions from 
epidemiological studies in order to quantify the health impacts of existing 
situations and/or alternative scenarios. The aim of this study was to improve 
HIA methods for air pollution studies in situations where exposures can be 
estimated using GIS with high spatial resolution and dispersion modeling 
approaches.
METHODS: Tallinn was divided into 84 sections according to neighborhoods, with a 
total population of approx. 390,000 persons. Actual baseline rates for total 
mortality and hospitalization with cardiovascular and respiratory diagnosis were 
identified. The exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) from local emissions was 
defined as the modeled annual levels. The model validation and morbidity 
assessment were based on 2006 PM10 or PM2.5 levels at 3 monitoring stations. The 
exposure-response coefficients used were for total mortality 6.2% (95% CI 
1.6-11%) per 10 microg/m3 increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration and for 
the assessment of respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations 1.14% (95% CI 
0.62-1.67%) and 0.73% (95% CI 0.47-0.93%) per 10 microg/m3 increase of PM10. The 
direct costs related to morbidity were calculated according to hospital 
treatment expenses in 2005 and the cost of premature deaths using the concept of 
Value of Life Year (VOLY).
RESULTS: The annual population-weighted-modeled exposure to locally emitted 
PM2.5 in Tallinn was 11.6 microg/m3. Our analysis showed that it corresponds to 
296 (95% CI 76528) premature deaths resulting in 3859 (95% CI 10236636) Years of 
Life Lost (YLL) per year. The average decrease in life-expectancy at birth per 
resident of Tallinn was estimated to be 0.64 (95% CI 0.17-1.10) years. While in 
the polluted city centre this may reach 1.17 years, in the least polluted 
neighborhoods it remains between 0.1 and 0.3 years. When dividing the YLL by the 
number of premature deaths, the decrease in life expectancy among the actual 
cases is around 13 years. As for the morbidity, the short-term effects of air 
pollution were estimated to result in an additional 71 (95% CI 43-104) 
respiratory and 204 (95% CI 131-260) cardiovascular hospitalizations per year. 
The biggest external costs are related to the long-term effects on mortality: 
this is on average euro 150 (95% CI 40-260) million annually. In comparison, the 
costs of short-term air-pollution driven hospitalizations are small euro 0.3 
(95% CI 0.2-0.4) million.
CONCLUSION: Sectioning the city for analysis and using GIS systems can help to 
improve the accuracy of air pollution health impact estimations, especially in 
study areas with poor air pollution monitoring data but available dispersion 
models.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of providing practical training to 
general practitioners (GPs) in shoulder problems, and administering a local 
anaesthetic (lignocaine) vs steroidal (cortisone) injection.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a cluster randomized 
trial with a factorial design, in general practices across five centres within 
the UK. A total of 155 participant GPs were randomized to receive training or no 
training with 200 participants randomized to either lignocaine or cortisone. 
Health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost per 
QALY gained over 1 year estimated from a health system and a societal 
perspective were the main outcomes measured.
RESULTS: Over 1 year, training GPs costs on average an additional pound sterling 
211 (95% credibility interval - pound sterling 237, pound sterling 661) than no 
training and produces higher mean QALYs (0.075; -0.004, 0.154) per patient, 
yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound sterling 2813 per QALY 
gained for trained GPs. Over the same period of 1 year, lignocaine costs an 
average of pound sterling 122 more (- pound sterling 232, pound sterling 476) 
than cortisone and produces virtually no differential gain in mean QALYs (0.001; 
-0.068, 0.070), yielding an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound sterling 
122,000 for lignocaine compared with cortisone. Across a range of 
cost-effectiveness thresholds, cortisone is as cost effective to inject as 
lignocaine. The probability that training is cost effective is above 0.95 at 
thresholds above pound sterling 20,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Providing practical training to GPs about shoulder problems is cost 
effective and there is little uncertainty regarding this decision. The choice 
between lignocaine and cortisone is more uncertain and it is likely that there 
is significant value of further research to reduce this uncertainty.

BACKGROUND: the numbers with dementia are projected to double between 2001 and 
2040, in line with continued increases in life expectancy. Projections have 
failed to account for the impact of changing risk factors on future numbers with 
dementia or disability.
OBJECTIVE: to estimate the size of the disabled population over the next 20 
years and explore the impact of treatments that delay onset of cognitive 
impairment and associated disability.
METHODS: a dynamic macro-simulation projection model was used to calculate the 
numbers of older people with disability to 2026. Transition rates to disability 
and death conditional on a range of conditions, calculated from the MRC 
Cognitive Function and Ageing Study, were applied to the 1992 England and Wales 
population. Scenarios for trends in dementia incidence, risk factors and 
treatment were devised from a systematic review and applied.
FINDINGS: population ageing alone resulted in 39% more older people between 2006 
and 2026 and 82% more with disability. A combination of reduced incidence of 
cognitive impairment and disabling consequences alongside improved survival 
provided the largest reductions in the disabled population (15,000) and the 
numbers cognitively impaired (302,000) compared with ageing of the population 
alone.
INTERPRETATION: population ageing alone will increase the disabled older 
population by over 80% and the numbers cognitively impaired by almost 50% over 
the next 20 years with serious implications for the provision of care. Research 
priorities should focus on earlier detection of dementia and its risk factors, 
thereby allowing earlier and more targeted treatment to alleviate its associated 
disability.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of mammography and clinical breast examination 
strategies: a comparison with current guidelines.

Ahern CH(1), Shen Y.

Medicine, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA.

PURPOSE: Breast cancer screening by mammography and clinical breast exam are 
commonly used for early tumor detection. Previous cost-effectiveness studies 
considered mammography alone or did not account for all relevant costs. In this 
study, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening schedules recommended by 
three major cancer organizations and compared them with alternative strategies. 
We considered costs of screening examinations, subsequent work-up, biopsy, and 
treatment interventions after diagnosis.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model to generate women's life histories, and 
assessed screening and treatment effects on survival. Using statistical models, 
we accounted for age-specific incidence, preclinical disease duration, and 
age-specific sensitivity and specificity for each screening modality. The 
outcomes of interest were quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved and total 
costs with a 3% annual discount rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
used to compare strategies. Sensitivity analyses were done by varying some of 
the assumptions.
RESULTS: Compared with guidelines from the National Cancer Institute and the 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, alternative strategies were more efficient. 
Mammography and clinical breast exam in alternating years from ages 40 to 79 
years was a cost-effective alternative compared with the guidelines, costing 
$35,500 per QALY saved compared with no screening. The American Cancer Society 
guideline was the most effective and the most expensive, costing over $680,000 
for an added QALY compared with the above alternative.
CONCLUSION: Screening strategies with lower costs and benefits comparable with 
those currently recommended should be considered for implementation in practice 
and for future guidelines.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2009 Mar 3;150(5):I42.

BACKGROUND: Little information is available about factors associated with racial 
differences across a broad spectrum of post-myocardial infarction outcomes, 
including patients' symptoms and quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To determine racial differences in mortality, rehospitalization, 
angina, and quality of life after myocardial infarction and identify the factors 
associated with these differences.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: 10 hospitals in the United States.
PATIENTS: 1849 patients who had myocardial infarction, 28% of whom were black.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, economic, clinical, psychosocial, and treatment 
characteristics and outcomes were prospectively collected. Outcomes included 
time to 2-year all-cause mortality, 1-year rehospitalization, and Seattle Angina 
Questionnaire-assessed angina and quality of life.
RESULTS: Black patients had higher unadjusted mortality (19.9% vs. 9.3%; P < 
0.001) and rehospitalization rates (45.4% vs. 40.4%; P = 0.130), more angina 
(28.0% vs. 17.8%; P < 0.001), and worse mean quality of life (80.6 [SD, 22.5] 
vs. 85.9 [SD, 17.2]; P < 0.001). After adjustment for patient characteristics, 
black patients trended toward greater mortality (hazard ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 
0.92 to 1.81]; P = 0.142), fewer rehospitalizations (hazard ratio, 0.82 [CI, 
0.66 to 1.02]; P = 0.071), and higher likelihood of angina at 1 year (odds 
ratio, 1.41 [CI, 1.03 to 1.94]; P = 0.032) but similar quality of life (mean 
difference, -0.6 [CI, -3.4 to 2.2]). Adjustment for site of care further 
attenuated mortality differences (hazard ratio, 1.04 [CI, 0.71 to 1.52]; P = 
0.84). Adjustment for treatments had minimal effect on any association.
LIMITATION: Residual confounding and missing data may have introduced bias.
CONCLUSION: Although black patients with myocardial infarction have worse 
outcomes than white patients, these differences did not persist after adjustment 
for patient factors and site of care. Further adjustment for treatments received 
minimally influenced observed differences. Strategies that focus on improving 
baseline cardiac risk and hospital factors may do more than treatment-focused 
strategies to attenuate racial differences in myocardial infarction outcomes.

Unipolar proximal femoral endoprosthetic replacement for tumour: the risk of 
revision in young patients.

Chandrasekar CR(1), Grimer RJ, Carter SR, Tillman RM, Abudu A, Jeys LM.

Author information:
(1)Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Bristol Road South, Birmingham B31 2AP, UK.

We undertook a cemental unipolar proximal femoral endoprosthetic replacement in 
131 patients with a mean age of 50 years (2 to 84). Primary malignant tumours 
were present in 54 patients and 67 had metastatic disease. In addition, eight 
patients had either lymphoma or myeloma and two had non-oncological disorders. 
The mean follow-up was 27 months (0 to 180). An acetabular revision was required 
later in 14 patients, 12 of whom had been under the age of 21 years at the time 
of insertion of their original prosthesis. The risk of acetabular revision in 
patients over 21 years of age was 8% at five years compared with 36% in those 
aged under 21 years. All the unipolar hips in this younger age group required 
revision within 11 years of the initial operation. We conclude that unipolar 
replacement should not be used in younger patients and should be avoided in 
patients with a life expectancy of more than five years.

(1)Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical 
Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Medical and technological advances over the past 2 decades have 
resulted in improved patient care for children with spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA). The objective of the present study was to describe changes in the life 
expectancy of pediatric patients with SMA over time and to compare these 
findings with previously reported survival patterns.
METHODS: Medical records of all patients diagnosed with SMA over a 16-year 
period (1989-2005) at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center were 
reviewed. Data pertaining to date of birth, type of SMA, medical and surgical 
interventions, pulmonary complications, and date of death were obtained.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed a significant improvement in 
survival probabilities in the severest form of SMA.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive trend in the survival of patients with severe 
SMA. Although we cannot attribute this trend to any single factor, it is likely 
that advances in pulmonary care and aggressive nutritional support have played a 
significant role.

Health is wealth! Is wealth health?

Klinkmann H(1), Vienken J.

Author information:
(1)hokliro@compuserve.com

Current demographic analyses of the world population show a considerable 
increase in life expectancy of the general population in nearly all regions of 
the world. Consequently, "Health Economy", defined as "Provision and marketing 
of goods and services in order to support the maintenance and restoration of 
health", has become the megatrend of the millenium. This holds true not only for 
national economies and GDPs, but also - in qualitative terms - for the elderly 
generation. Guestimates on the purchasing power of the elderly generation show a 
threefold higher figure compared to the actual working population, at least in 
the Western hemisphere. A globally organized wellness industry will profit from 
this situation. However, the increased morbidity of the elderly generation 
requires enormous financial endeavours to provide resources not only for 
healthcare programmes, such as disease prevention, healthcare education and 
improvement in quality-of-life pattern, but also for the development of
