Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors 
(R-SNAREs) mainly promoted the assembly of the SNARE complex to drive the final 
membrane fusion step of membrane transport. Previous research on R-SNAREs has 
mainly focused on development and growth and has rarely been involved in abiotic 
stress, especially in cotton. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of 
R-SNARE genes in upland cotton. In total, 51 Gh-R-SNARE genes across six 
phylogenetic groups were unevenly distributed on 21 chromosomes. Cis elements 
related to plant growth and response to abiotic stress responses were found in 
the promoter region of Gh-R-SNAREs. Nine Gh-R-SNARE genes were obviously 
upregulated under drought stress conditions by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis. 
Among them, GhVAMP72l might be the key candidate gene contributing to drought 
stress tolerance in cotton by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay. These 
results provide valuable insights for the functional analysis of cotton R-SNAREs 
in response to drought stress and highlight potential beneficial genes for 
genetic improvement and breeding in cotton.

Chrysobothris mali Horn and Chrysobothris femorata (Olivier) (Coleoptera: 
Buprestidae) are wood-boring beetles native to western North America. Both 
species are highly polyphagous, feeding on a wide range of deciduous trees and 
shrubs, including fruit and nut trees as well as shade trees grown as nursery 
stock. Chrysobothris femorata is widely distributed across North America, while 
C. mali occurs west of the Rocky Mountains. There is a notable lack of basic 
biological information regarding both species' phenology and distributions in 
the Pacific Northwest. To better understand the biology of these economically 
important insects, seasonal adult collection information, host plant association 
data, and morphological measurements were collected from preserved specimens 
residing in 5 major regional arthropod collections. Label information was 
collected from 661 C. mali and 165 C. femorata specimens. Collection location 
data were used to create a map of C. femorata and C. mali distributions in the 
western United States, indicating that C. femorata is significantly less 
abundant in California, Oregon, and Washington than C. mali. Of the 50 
associated plant taxa noted on specimen labels, only 4 associations were shared 
between the species, potentially indicating host specialization. New 
reproductive hosts are recorded for C. femorata (2 hosts) and C. mali (3 hosts). 
Tree species commonly damaged by flatheaded borers in commercial orchards and 
nurseries were not present in the historical records. The insights gleaned from 
specimen data allow researchers to better understand the biology and ecology of 
these understudied, yet economically impactful insects in the western United 
States.

BACKGROUND: Vascular malformations are rare diseases and treatment remains 
controversial. Sclerotherapy is accepted as a minimally invasive treatment with 
good results; however, some patients do not report good response to 
sclerotherapy, and it is not clear which variables influence treatment outcome, 
preventing optimal patient selection. We hypothesized that large diameter 
lesions have reduced efficacy and satisfaction with sclerotherapy. Therefore, we 
prospectively evaluated the clinical response of low-flow vascular malformations 
treated with 1% polidocanol foam sclerotherapy and determined the correlation of 
symptom improvement with clinical variables.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients with symptomatic low flow vascular 
malformations treated at the Hospital das Clínicas between December 2016 and 
November 2018. Lesions were classified according to location, extension, 
diameter, type of vessels, margins, and symptoms. Sclerotherapy was performed by 
direct injection of 1% polidocanol foam, with a maximum volume of 10 ml per 
session. Symptom improvement was evaluated using the visual analog scale and 
patient-reported quality of life was assessed by the Short-form 6 dimensions 
(SF-6D) questionnaire. Follow-up was performed every 3 months after treatment.
RESULTS: Forty lesions were treated in 38 patients, with 19 women and 19 men; 
median age was 20.5 years (range 4 months to 63 years). Most lesions (80%) were 
venous, and most commonly in the lower limbs (47.5%); 27.5% were superficial, 
35% were deep, and 37.5% affected both compartments. The most common clinical 
presentations were deformity (95%), pain (78%), and functional limitation (58%); 
deep compartment lesions were more associated with functional limitation (69% 
vs. 27%; P = 0.030). Fifty-three per cent of lesions were >10 cm and were 
associated with increased numbers of psychosocial symptoms (P = 0.038). 
Two-hundred and forty-two sessions of sclerotherapy were performed, with 6 mean 
treatments per lesion (range 1-15). The mean follow-up time was 23 months (range 
2-23 months). The most common complications were pain and local edema, without 
any major complications; some patients reported symptom recurrence (15% pain, 
10% deformity, and 12% functional limitation). Sclerotherapy was associated with 
significant improvement of all symptoms (P < 0.001). However, lesions >10 cm 
were associated with poor improvement in deformity (P = 0.003). Quality of life 
improved for most patients (60%) and treatment satisfaction was high (82%).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of low-flow vascular malformations with 1% polidocanol 
foam is safe and effective; sclerotherapy improves symptoms and quality of life. 
Large diameter lesions (>10 cm) are associated with increased treatment failure. 
A small percentage of patients reported recurrent symptoms and require other 
modalities for successful treatment.

BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism affects 3-14% of hypertensive patients in the 
primary care setting and up to 30% in the hypertensive referral units. Although 
primary aldosteronism screening is recommended in patients with 
treatment-resistant hypertension, diagnosis at an earlier stage of disease may 
prevent end-organ damage and optimize patient outcomes.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening 
for primary aldosteronism in treatment and disease (cardiovascular disease and 
stroke) naive hypertensive patients. Within the model, a 40-year-old patient 
with hypertension went through either the screened or the unscreened arm of the 
model. They were followed until age 80 or death. In the screening arm, the 
patient underwent standard diagnostic testing for primary aldosteronism if the 
screening test, aldosterone-to-renin ratio, was elevated above 70 pmol/l : mU/l. 
Diagnostic accuracies, transition probabilities and costs were derived from 
published literature and expert advice. The main outcome of interest was the 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Screening hypertensive patients for primary aldosteronism compared with 
not screening attained an ICER of AU$35 950.44 per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. The results were robust to different sensitivity analyses. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that in 73% of the cases, it was 
cost-effective to screen at the commonly adopted willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold of AU$50 000.
CONCLUSION: The results from this study demonstrated that screening all 
hypertensive patients for primary aldosteronism from age 40 is cost-effective. 
The findings argue in favour of screening for primary aldosteronism before the 
development of severe hypertension in the Australian healthcare setting.

Cellular senescence has emerged as a fundamental biological mechanism 
underpinning the ageing process and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
an increasing number of age-related conditions. Cellular senescence is a cell 
fate originally defined as an irreversible loss of replicative potential 
although it is now clear that it can be induced by a variety of mechanisms 
independent of replication and telomere attrition. The drivers include a 
persistent DNA damage response causing multiple alterations in cellular 
function. Senescent cells secrete a range of mediators that drive chronic 
inflammation and can convert other cells to the senescent state-the 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Much research to date has been 
conducted in animal models, but it is now clear that senescent cells accompany 
ageing in humans and their presence is an important driver of disease across 
systems. Proof-of-concept work suggests that preventing or reversing senescence 
may be a viable strategy to counteract human ageing and age-related disease. 
Possible interventions include exercise, nutrition and senolytics/senostatic 
drugs although there are a number of potential limitations to the use of 
senotherapeutics. These interventions are generally tested for single-organ 
conditions, but the real power of this approach is the potential to tackle 
multiple age-related conditions. The litmus test for this exciting new class of 
therapies, however, will be whether they can improve healthy life expectancy 
rather than merely extending lifespan. The outcomes measured in clinical studies 
need to reflect these aims if senotherapeutics are to gain the trust of 
clinicians, patients and the public.

Additive Manufacturing is noted for ease of product customization and short 
production run cost-effectiveness. As our global population approaches 8 
billion, additive manufacturing has a future in maintaining and improving 
average human life expectancy for the same reasons that it has advantaged 
general manufacturing. In recent years, additive manufacturing has been applied 
to tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery. Additive 
Manufacturing combined with tissue engineering and biocompatibility studies 
offers future opportunities for various complex cardiovascular implants and 
surgeries. This paper is a comprehensive overview of current technological 
advancements in additive manufacturing with potential for cardiovascular 
application. The current limitations and prospects of the technology for 
cardiovascular applications are explored and evaluated.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with brain-spread renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) is an unmet clinical need, although more recent therapeutic strategies 
have significantly improved RCC patients' life expectancy. Our multicenter, 
retrospective, observational study investigated a real-world cohort of patients 
with brain metastases (BM) from RCC (BMRCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 226 patients with histological diagnosis of RCC 
and radiological evidence of BM from 22 Italian institutions were enrolled. 
Univariate and multivariate models were performed to investigate the impact of 
clinicopathological features and multimodal treatments on both overall survival 
(OS) from the BM diagnosis and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS).
RESULTS: The median OS from the BM diagnosis was 18.8 months (interquartile 
range: 6.2-43 months). Multivariate analysis confirmed the following as positive 
independent prognostic factors: a Karnofsky Performance Status >70% [hazard 
ratio (HR) = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.92, P = 0.0026] and a 
single BM (HR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.86, P = 0. 0310); in contrast, the following 
were confirmed as worse prognosis factors: progressive extracranial disease 
(HR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.003-2.74, P = 0.00181) and only one line of systemic 
therapy after the BM occurrence (HR = 2.98, 95% CI 1.62-5.49, P = 0.029). 
Subgroup analyses showed no difference in iPFS according to the type of the 
first systemic treatment [immunotherapy (IT) or targeted therapy (TT)] carried 
out after the BM diagnosis (HR = 1.033, 95% CI 0.565-1.889, P = 0.16), and 
revealed that external radiation therapy (eRT) significantly prolonged iPFS when 
combined with IT (10.7 months, 95% CI 4.9-48 months, P = 0.0321) and not when 
combined with TT (9.01 months, 95% CI 2.7-21.2 months, P = 0.59).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a potential additive effect in terms of iPFS 
for eRT combined with IT and encourage a more intensive multimodal therapeutic 
strategy in a multidisciplinary context to improve the survival of BMRCC 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Deciding whether to treat or conservatively manage patients with 
prostate cancer is challenging. Recent changes in guidelines, advances in 
treatment technologies, and policy can influence decision making surrounding 
management, particularly for those for whom the decision to treat is 
discretionary. Contemporary trends in management of newly diagnosed prostate 
cancer are unclear.
METHODS: Using national Medicare data, men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer 
were identified between 2014 and 2019. Patients were classified by 5- and 
10-year noncancer mortality risk. Multinomial logistic regression models were 
fit to assess adjusted trends in management over time. The primary outcome was 
management of prostate cancer: local treatment (inclusive of surgery, radiation, 
brachytherapy, or cryotherapy), hormone therapy, or observation.
RESULTS: Local treatment was the most common form of management and stable 
across years (68%). Use of observation increased (21%-23%, P < .001) and use of 
hormone therapy decreased (11%-8%, P < 0.001). After stratifying by 10-year 
non-cancer mortality risk, observation increased among men with low 
(22.3%-26.1%, P < .001) and moderate (19.9%-23.5%, P < .001) mortality risk. 
Conversely, use of treatment increased among those with high (62.8%-68.0%, 
P = .004) and very high (45.5%-54.1%, P < .001) risk of noncancer mortality. 
These trends were similar across groups when stratified by 5-year noncancer 
mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: Nationally, use of local treatment remains common and was stable 
throughout the study period. However, while local treatment declined among men 
with a lower risk of noncancer mortality, it increased among men with a higher 
risk of non-cancer mortality.

BACKGROUND: Longitudinal changes in neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were 
evaluated alongside prespecified clinical assessments 24 months into the 
patisiran Global open-label extension (OLE) study in patients with ATTRv 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.
METHODS: All patients enrolled in the Global OLE, from phase III APOLLO and 
phase II OLE parent studies, received patisiran. Assessments included measures 
of polyneuropathy (modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7)), quality of 
life (QOL; Norfolk QOL-Diabetic Neuropathy questionnaire (Norfolk QOL-DN)), and 
plasma NfL.
RESULTS: Patients receiving patisiran in the parent study (APOLLO-patisiran, 
n = 137; phase II OLE-patisiran, n = 25) demonstrated sustained improvements in 
mNIS+7 (mean change from parent study baseline (95% confidence interval): 
APOLLO-patisiran -4.8 (-8.9, -0.6); phase II OLE-patisiran -5.8 (-10.5, -1.2)) 
and Norfolk QOL-DN (APOLLO-patisiran -2.4 (-7.2, 2.3)), and maintained reduced 
NfL levels at Global OLE 24 months. After initiating patisiran in the Global 
OLE, APOLLO-placebo patients (n = 49) demonstrated stabilized mNIS+7, improved 
Norfolk QOL-DN, and significantly reduced NfL levels. Patisiran continued to 
demonstrate an acceptable safety profile. Earlier patisiran initiation was 
associated with a lower exposure-adjusted mortality rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term patisiran treatment led to sustained improvements in 
neuropathy and QOL, with NfL demonstrating potential as a biomarker for disease 
progression and treatment response in ATTRv amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.

The pathetic malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a extremely uncommon and 
confrontational tumor that evolves in the mesothelium layer of the pleural 
cavities (inner lining- visceral pleura and outer lining- parietal pleura), 
peritoneum, pericardium, and tunica vaginalis and is highly resistant to 
standard treatments. In mesothelioma, the predominant pattern of lesions is a 
loss of genes that limit tumour growth. Despite the worldwide ban on the 
manufacture and supply of asbestos, the prevalence of mesothelioma continues to 
increase. Mesothelioma presents and behaves in a variety of ways, making 
diagnosis challenging. Most treatments available today for MM are ineffective, 
and the median life expectancy is between 10 and 12 months. However, in recent 
years, considerable progress has already been made in understanding the genetics 
and molecular pathophysiology of mesothelioma by addressing hippo signaling 
pathway. The development and progression of MM are related to many important 
genetic alterations. This is related to NF2 and/or LATS2 mutations that activate 
the transcriptional coactivator YAP. The X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and PET scans 
are used to diagnose the MM. The MM are treated with surgery, chemotherapy, 
first-line combination chemotherapy, second-line treatment, radiation therapy, 
adoptive T-cell treatment, targeted therapy, and cancer vaccines. Recent 
clinical trials investigating the function of surgery have led to the 
development of innovative approaches to the treatment of associated pleural 
effusions as well as the introduction of targeted medications. An 
interdisciplinary collaborative approach is needed for the effective care of 
persons who have mesothelioma because of the rising intricacy of mesothelioma 
treatment. This article highlights the key findings in the molecular 
pathogenesis of mesothelioma, diagnosis with special emphasis on the management 
of mesothelioma.

The incidence of second primary malignancies (SPMs) in long-term survivors of 
multiple myeloma (MM) is increasing because of increased life expectancy. We 
retrospectively analyzed the risk factors for SPMs in patients with MM after 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) before and after the introduction of 
proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). In total, 2340 
patients newly diagnosed with MM who underwent ASCT between 1995 and 2016 were 
enrolled in this study. Forty-three patients developed SPMs (29 solid, 12 
hematological, and 2 unknown tumors), with cumulative incidence rates of 0.8% 
and 2.5% at 24 and 60 months, respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of 
hematological and solid SPMs at 60 months were 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively. The 
overall survival (OS) rate at 60 months after ASCT was 62.9% and the OS rates 
after the diagnosis of SPMs at 24 months were 72.2% for hematological SPMs and 
70.9% for solid SPMs. Multivariate analysis revealed that the use of IMiDs (P = 
0.024) and radiation (P = 0.002) were significant independent risk factors for 
SPMs. The probabilities of developing SPMs and death due to other causes (mainly 
MM) at 60 months were 2.5% and 36.5%, respectively, indicating that the risk of 
SPMs was lower than that of death from MM. Furthermore, SPMs between the 
pre-novel and novel agent eras (ASCT between 2007 and 2016) groups significantly 
increased (1.9% vs. 4.3% at 60 months, P = 0.022). The early occurrence of SPMs 
after ASCT should be monitored cautiously.

Developing and Selecting Mapping Algorithms Based on Linear Regression.

Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

PURPOSE: To propose using a framework for calculating the sample size for 
clinical prediction models when developing and selecting mapping algorithms from 
a health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measure onto the score of a 
preference-based measure (PBM) using linear regression.
METHODS: The framework was summarized for health economics researchers. Mapping 
studies that mapped the European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 onto the EQ-5D-3L index using 
linear regression were evaluated in terms of sample size. The required sample 
size for each study was calculated using 4 criteria: global shrinkage 
factor ≥ 0.9, difference between the apparent and adjusted R2 ≤ 0.05, 
multiplicative margin of error in the estimated residual standard 
deviation ≤ 1.1, and absolute margin of error in the estimated model 
intercept ≤ 0.025.
RESULTS: Ten mapping studies were identified. The information required to 
calculate the sample size was successfully extracted from previous mapping 
studies. Four of 10 mapping studies did not have sufficient sample sizes.
LIMITATIONS: Further extension of this framework to other regression approaches 
used in mapping studies is necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: The sample size should be considered when developing and selecting 
a mapping algorithm based on linear regression.
HIGHLIGHTS: No recommendation or guidance is available for the sample size to 
develop and select a mapping algorithm from a health-related quality-of-life 
measure onto the score of a preference-based measure.This research proposes 
using a framework for calculating the sample size for clinical prediction models 
in sample size consideration for mapping algorithms using linear regression.A 
survey showed that the information required to calculate the sample size could 
be successfully extracted from previous mapping studies and that 4 of 10 mapping 
studies did not have sufficient sample sizes.

Improving Predictability and Effectiveness in Preventive Digital Health 
Interventions: Scoping Review.

Pedersen K(1), Schlichter BR(1).

Author information:
(1)Information Systems, Department of Management, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, 
Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle-related diseases caused by inadequate diet and physical 
activity cause premature death, loss of healthy life years, and increased health 
care costs. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies indicate that preventive 
digital health interventions (P-DHIs) can be effective in preventing these 
health problems, but the results of these studies are mixed. Adoption studies 
have identified multiple factors related to individuals and the context in which 
they live that complicate the transfer of positive results from RCT studies to 
practical use. Implementation studies have revealed barriers to the large-scale 
implementation of mobile health (mHealth) solutions in general. Consequently, 
there is no clear path to delivering predictable outcomes from P-DHIs and 
achieving effectiveness when scaling up interventions to reduce health problems 
in society.
OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to expand our understanding of how to increase 
the outcome predictability of P-DHIs by focusing on physical activity and diet 
behaviors and amplify our understanding of how to improve effectiveness in 
large-scale implementations.
METHODS: The research objective was pursued through a multidisciplinary scoping 
review. This scoping review used the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) as a guide. 
A comprehensive search of Web of Science and PubMed limited to English-language 
journal articles published before January 2022 was conducted. Google Scholar was 
used for hand searches. Information systems theory was used to identify key 
constructs influencing outcomes of IT in general. Public health and mHealth 
literature were used to identify factors influencing the adoption of, outcomes 
from, and implementation of P-DHIs. Finally, the P-DHI investment model was 
developed based on information systems constructs and factors from the public 
health and mHealth literature.
RESULTS: In total, 203 articles met the eligibility criteria. The included 
studies used a variety of methodologies, including literature reviews, 
interviews, surveys, and RCT studies. The P-DHI investment model suggests which 
constructs and related factors should be emphasized to increase the 
predictability of P-DHI outcomes and improve the effectiveness of large-scale 
implementations.
CONCLUSIONS: The research suggests that outcome predictability could be improved 
by including descriptions of the constructs and factors in the P-DHI investment 
model when reporting from empirical studies. Doing so would increase our 
understanding of when and why P-DHIs succeed or fail. The effectiveness of 
large-scale implementations may be improved by using the P-DHI investment model 
to evaluate potential difficulties and possibilities in implementing P-DHIs to 
create better environments for their use before investing in them and when 
designing and implementing them. The cost-effectiveness of large-scale 
implementations is unknown; implementations are far more complicated than just 
downloading and using apps, and there is uncertainty accompanying 
implementations given the lack of coordinated control over the constructs and 
factors that influence the outcome.

A Dynamic Prediction Model Supporting Individual Life Expectancy Prediction 
Based on Longitudinal Time-Dependent Covariates.

Zhang C, Li Z, Yang Z, Huang B, Hou Y, Chen Z.

In the field of clinical chronic diseases, common prediction results (such as 
survival rate) and effect size hazard ratio (HR) are relative indicators, 
resulting in more abstract information. However, clinicians and patients are 
more interested in simple and intuitive concepts of (survival) time, such as how 
long a patient may live or how much longer a patient in a treatment group will 
live. In addition, due to the long follow-up time, resulting in generation of 
longitudinal time-dependent covariate information, patients are interested in 
how long they will survive at each follow-up visit. In this study, based on a 
time scale indicator-restricted mean survival time (RMST)-we proposed a dynamic 
RMST prediction model by considering longitudinal time-dependent covariates and 
utilizing joint model techniques. The model can describe the change trajectory 
of longitudinal time-dependent covariates and predict the average survival times 
of patients at different time points (such as follow-up visits). Simulation 
studies through Monte Carlo cross-validation showed that the dynamic RMST 
prediction model was superior to the static RMST model. In addition, the dynamic 
RMST prediction model was applied to a primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) 
population to dynamically predict the average survival times of the patients, 
and the average C-index of the internal validation of the model reached 0.81, 
which was better than that of the static RMST regression. Therefore, the 
proposed dynamic RMST prediction model has better performance in prediction and 
can provide a scientific basis for clinicians and patients to make clinical 
decisions.

Childhood dementia is a devastating and under-recognized group of disorders with 
a high level of unmet need. Typically monogenic in origin, this collective of 
individual neurodegenerative conditions are defined by a progressive impairment 
of neurocognitive function, presenting in childhood and adolescence. This 
scoping review aims to clarify definitions and conceptual boundaries of 
childhood dementia and quantify the collective disease burden. A literature 
review identified conditions that met the case definition. An expert clinical 
working group reviewed and ratified inclusion. Epidemiological data were 
extracted from published literature and collective burden modelled. One hundred 
and seventy genetic childhood dementia disorders were identified. Of these, 25 
were analysed separately as treatable conditions. Collectively, currently 
untreatable childhood dementia was estimated to have an incidence of 34.5 per 
100 000 (1 in 2900 births), median life expectancy of 9 years and prevalence of 
5.3 per 100 000 persons. The estimated number of premature deaths per year is 
similar to childhood cancer (0-14 years) and approximately 70% of those deaths 
will be prior to adulthood. An additional 49.8 per 100 000 births are 
attributable to treatable conditions that would cause childhood dementia if not 
diagnosed early and stringently treated. A relational database of the childhood 
dementia disorders has been created and will be continually updated as new 
disorders are identified (https://knowledgebase.childhooddementia.org/). We 
present the first comprehensive overview of monogenic childhood dementia 
conditions and their collective epidemiology. Unifying these conditions, with 
consistent language and definitions, reinforces motivation to advance 
therapeutic development and health service supports for this significantly 
disadvantaged group of children and their families.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of renal failure in the 
United States. Screening for albuminuria in individuals with diabetes is 
critical to identify the early stages of DKD. Prompt identification and 
management of DKD improves patient outcomes, increases life expectancy, and 
decreases health care costs.
LOCAL PROBLEM: The DKD screening rate for patients ≥18 years of age with 
diabetes at the project site was 29%, below the national benchmark of 90%. 
Patients diagnosed with DKD were not receiving appropriate management. This 
quality-improvement project used a standardized protocol consisting of a 
checklist and educational initiatives to improve DKD identification and 
management.
METHODS: The Knowledge-to-Action Framework was used for this project at a 
primary care practice in the southeastern United States. Data collection 
included demographic data, DKD screening with urine albumin-to-creatine ratio, 
diagnosis rates, DKD treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
(ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) reviewed 6 months before and after 
intervention.
INTERVENTIONS: Evidence-based interventions included a DKD educational 
in-service for clinical staff, creation of a standardized protocol through a 
checklist for screening and appropriate management of DKD, and implementation of 
patient educational handouts.
RESULTS: Diabetic kidney disease screening rates increased by 100%, patients 
diagnosed with DKD decreased by 8%, patients with DKD on ACEi/ARB increased by 
39%, and patients with DKD on SGLT2i increased by 15%.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of a standardized protocol through a checklist and 
providing patient education on DKD can improve DKD identification/management.
