Aim: To extrapolate clinical trial results to estimate and compare expected 
progression-free and overall life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) 
for larotrectinib and entrectinib in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), soft 
tissue sarcoma (STS) and brain metastases prior to treatment with larotrectinib 
or entrectinib. Methods: A naive direct comparison of larotrectinib versus 
entrectinib was made using partitioned survival modeling methods from clinical 
trial data. Results: Larotrectinib resulted in an additional 1.58 LYs (1.17 
QALYs), 5.81 LYs (2.02 QALYs) and 1.01 LYs in CRC, STS and baseline brain 
metastases, respectively, compared with entrectinib. Conclusion: Larotrectinib 
provided life expectancy and QALY gains compared with entrectinib. Additional 
studies will be beneficial as more patients are treated and survival data 
develop to better inform comparative effectiveness results.

BACKGROUND: Estimated life expectancy is one of the most important factors in 
determining treatment options for prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, 
clinicians have few effective prognostic tools to individually assess survival 
in patients with PCa.
METHODS: We screened 283,252 patients diagnosed with PCa from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2015, and 
randomly divided them into the training and validation groups. We used 
univariate and multivariate Cox analyses to identify independent prognostic 
factors and further established nomograms to predict 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year 
overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for PCa patients. The 
prediction performance of nomograms was tested and externally validated by 
Concordance index (C-index) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. 
Calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used for internal 
validation. We further developed PCa prognostic scoring system based on the 
impact of available variables on survival.
RESULTS: The variables age, race, marital status, TNM stage, surgery method, 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, PSA value, and Gleason score identified as 
independent prognostic factors were included in the survival nomograms. The 
results of training (C-index: OS = 0.776, CSS = 0.889; AUC value: 
OS = 0.772-0.802, CSS = 0.892-0.936) and external validation (C-index: 
OS = 0.759, CSS = 0.875) indicated our nomograms had good performance in 
predicting 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS and CSS prediction. Internal validation 
using the calibration curves and DCA curves demonstrated the effectiveness of 
the prediction models. The prognostic scoring system was more effective than the 
AJCC staging system in predicting the survival of PCa patients, especially for 
OS.
CONCLUSION: The prognostic nomograms and prognostic scoring system have 
favorable performance in predicting OS and CSS of PCa patients. These 
individualized survival prediction tools may contribute to clinical decisions.

Fine particulate matter, particles less than 2.5 um in diameter (PM2.5), is an 
important environmental human health factor to consider. The long- and 
short-term influence of PM2.5 on health has been extensively studied in relation 
to many health outcomes, although few investigations examined the consequences 
of chronic ambient PM2.5 on life expectancy, which constitutes an important 
gauge of public human health status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
investigate the effects of reducing ambient PM2.5 levels in Taiwan on life 
expectancy there from 2000 to 2020. Officially reported island-wide annually 
average concentrations of ambient PM2.5, county-level life expectancies, and 
demographic and socioeconomic and proxy variable were collected for the 
prevalence of smoking from various national public agencies and organizations, 
since variables these might potentially confound life expectancy results. The 
relationship between changes in ambient PM2.5 levels and life expectancy were 
determined using linear regression. Data demonstrated that counties with greater 
reductions in ambient PM2.5 concentrations were associated with higher life 
expectancies. Adjusting for alterations in demographic and socioeconomic 
variables and proxy parameter, the prevalence of smoking data from a multiple 
regression model, it was found that a 0.3-year rise in life expectancy was noted 
for each 10 ug/m3 decrease in PM2.5 in those counties. Our findings show that 
reducing ambient PM2.5 levels play an important role for prolongation of life 
expectancy in Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Caste plays a significant role in individual healthcare access and 
health outcomes in India. Discrimination against low-caste communities 
contributes to their poverty and poor health outcomes. The Rashtriya Swasthya 
Bima Yojana (RSBY), a national health insurance program, was created to improve 
healthcare access for the poor. This study accounts for caste-based disparities 
in RSBY enrollment in India by decomposing the contributions of relevant 
factors.
METHODS: Using the data from the 2015-2016 round of the National Family Health 
Survey, we compare RSBY enrollment rates of low-caste and high-caste households. 
We use a non-linear extension of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and estimate two 
models by pooling coefficients across the comparison groups and all caste 
groups. Enrollment differentials are decomposed into individual- and 
household-level characteristics, media access, and state-level fixed effects, 
allowing 2000 replications and random ordering of variables.
RESULTS: The analysis of 480,766 households show that scheduled tribe households 
have the highest enrollment (18.85%), followed by 14.13% for scheduled caste, 
10.67% for other backward caste, and 9.33% for high caste. Household factors, 
family head's characteristics, media access, and state-level fixed effects 
account for a 32% to 52% gap in enrollment. More specifically, the enrollment 
gaps are attributable to differences in wealth status, educational attainment, 
residence, family size, dependency ratio, media access, and occupational 
activities of the households.
CONCLUSIONS: Weaker socio-economic status of low-caste households explains their 
high RSBY enrollments.

Moving Protein PEGylation from an Art to a Data Science.

PEGylation is a well-established and clinically proven half-life extension 
strategy for protein delivery. Protein modification with amine-reactive 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) generates heterogeneous and complex bioconjugate 
mixtures, often composed of several PEG positional isomers with varied 
therapeutic efficacy. Laborious and costly experiments for reaction optimization 
and purification are needed to generate a therapeutically useful PEG conjugate. 
Kinetic models which accurately predict the outcome of so-called "random" 
PEGylation reactions provide an opportunity to bypass extensive wet lab 
experimentation and streamline the bioconjugation process. In this study, we 
propose a protein tertiary structure-dependent reactivity model that describes 
the rate of protein-amine PEGylation and introduces "PEG chain coverage" as a 
tangible metric to assess the shielding effect of PEG chains. This 
structure-dependent reactivity model was implemented into three models (linear, 
structure-based, and machine-learned) to gain insight into how protein-specific 
molecular descriptors (exposed surface areas, pKa, and surface charge) impacted 
amine reactivity at each site. Linear and machine-learned models demonstrated 
over 75% prediction accuracy with butylcholinesterase. Model validation with 
Somavert, PEGASYS, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase showed good correlation 
between predicted and experimentally determined degrees of modification. Our 
structure-dependent reactivity model was also able to simulate PEGylation 
progress curves and estimate "PEGmer" distribution with accurate predictions 
across different proteins, PEG linker chemistry, and PEG molecular weights. 
Moreover, in-depth analysis of these simulated reaction curves highlighted 
possible PEG conformational transitions (from dumbbell to brush) on the surface 
of lysozyme, as a function of PEG molecular weight.

Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy and declining birth rate are two key 
drivers of population aging globally, resulting in a falling population.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the evolution of pediatric patients with 
vertigo/dizziness during the past two decades.
METHODS: From 2001 to 2010, a total of 17,123 new patients with 
vertigo/dizziness visited our neurotological clinic. Of them, 472 (2.8%) were 
children (Group A). In contrast, 260 children (1.3%) out of 20,404 new patients 
with vertigo/dizziness were experienced during the period 2011-2020 (Group B). 
All patients underwent an inner ear test battery before diagnosis.
RESULTS: The incidence of pediatric vertigo/dizziness in relation to overall 
neurotological cases significantly decreased from the first decade (2.8%) to the 
second decade (1.3%). Approximately 80% prevalence of pediatric 
vertigo/dizziness cases were referred to as vestibular migraine and benign 
paroxysmal vertigo of childhood regardless of Group A or B. Correlation between 
annual birth rate (x) and incidence of pediatric vertigo/dizziness cases in 
relation to overall neurotological cases (y) represented as y = 6.488x - 0.037 
via linear regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: The evolution of pediatric vertigo/dizziness revealed decreased 
incidence from 2.8% (2001-2010) to 1.3% (2011-2020), which may be related to the 
declined annual birth rate from 11.7‰ (2001) to 7.0‰ (2020).

CONTEXT: The assessment of pediatric muscle strength is necessary in a range of 
applications, including rehabilitation programs. Handheld dynamometry (HHD) is 
considered easy to use, portable, and low cost, but validity to measure lower 
limb muscle strength in children has not been assessed.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the concurrent validity of lower limb torque from HHD 
compared with isokinetic dynamometry (ID) in children aged from 7 to 11 years 
old.
DESIGN: A descriptive assessment of concurrent validity of lower limb joint 
torques from HHD compared with ID.
METHODS: Sixty-one typically developing children underwent assessment of maximal 
hip, knee, and ankle isometric torque by HHD and ID using standardized 
protocols. Joint positions were selected to represent maximal strength and were 
replicated between devices. Concurrent validity was determined by Pearson 
correlation, limits of agreement, and Bland-Altman plots.
RESULTS: Correlations between HHD and ID were moderate to large for knee 
extension (r 95% CI, .39 to .73), small to large for plantar flexion (r 95% CI, 
.29 to .67), knee flexion (r 95% CI, .16 to .59), hip flexion (r 95% CI, .21 to 
.57), hip extension (r 95% CI, .18 to .54), and hip adduction (r 95% CI, .12 to 
.56), and small to moderate for dorsiflexion (r 95% CI, -.11 to .39) and hip 
abduction (r 95% CI, -.02 to .46). Limits of agreement for all joint torques 
were greater than 10% indicating large error in HHD measured torque compared 
with ID. A positive proportional bias was detected for plantarflexion, 
indicating that HHD underestimated torque to a greater extent in participants 
with higher torque values.
CONCLUSIONS: Maximal torque values from HHD and ID are consistent with those 
previously reported in the literature. Poor concurrent validity of HHD may have 
arisen from issues around joint position, joint stabilization, and the 
experience of the tester to prevent an isokinetic contraction. Pediatric lower 
limb muscle strength assessed by HHD should be interpreted with caution.

OBJECTIVE: Adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab improves the postoperative 
life expectancy of women with early-stage breast cancer. Although trastuzumab is 
reportedly cardiotoxic, quantification based on real-world evidence is lacking. 
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyse trastuzumab cardiotoxicity using a 
nationwide claim-based database.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used data from a nationwide claims 
database (Japan Medical Data Center, Tokyo, Japan) under the universal 
healthcare system. Women with breast cancer who underwent initial surgery were 
included. Patients with recurrent or advanced-stage breast cancer, with a 
history of heart failure, receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or a preoperative 
history of less than 6 months were excluded. Propensity score (PS) was 
calculated using logistic regression based on age, cardiovascular risk factors, 
radiotherapy and concomitant anthracyclines (AC).
RESULTS: We identified 12 060 eligible patients (mean age 50.8±8.56 years) 
between January 2010 and December 2019. After 1:2 PS matching (trastuzumab 
users, TZ, n=1005; non-users, NT, n=2010), Cox proportional hazards model 
analysis showed that the rate of heart failure development within 18 months 
postoperative was significantly higher in the TZ group than in the NT group 
(adjusted HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.77). Baseline cardiac evaluation in the 
combined AC/TZ cases was 27.2% preoperative, 66.0% pre-AC and 86.6% pre-TZ, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab cardiotoxicity remained relevant in the claim-based 
analysis adjusted for AC effects. Further collaborative studies in 
cardio-oncology with real-world data are warranted to improve the rate of 
baseline cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with cancer scheduled for 
cardiotoxic cancer treatment.

Radiation plexitis, also known as radiation-induced brachial neuropathy is a 
rare toxicity following axillary, breast, cervical or thoracic radiotherapy, 
first described in 1966 by Stoll and Andrew. Although improvements in 
radiotherapy techniques have greatly reduced its risk over the past seventy 
years, its severe form remains a dreaded complication that is difficult to 
manage in patients with increased life expectancy. This article summarizes the 
epidemiological elements, risk factors, diagnostic methods, doses and 
constraints to be respected in radiotherapy and the treatment strategies of 
radiation plexitis.

PURPOSE: Needle syringe programs (NSP) significantly reduce risk behavior and 
HIV and hepatitis transmission in people who inject drugs (PWID). However, PWID 
are underrepresented in studies on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 
representing a barrier to evaluate effects of public health and preventive 
measures related to injecting drug use. In this study, we investigate how well 
the two questionnaires EQ-5D-3L and SF-6D measure health in PWID. We also 
estimate HRQoL in the PWID population.
METHOD: Data on demographics, injection drug use, HIV, hepatitis status, and 
self-reported HRQoL were collected from 550 PWID enrolled in the Stockholm NSP 
at enrollment and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. Self-rated HRQoL was 
measured as QALY, using EQ-5D-3L and the SF-6D. Item response theory (IRT) was 
used to evaluate which of the two instruments that measure health most 
accurately in this population. Regression analysis was used to estimate 
population-specific QALYs.
RESULTS: The IRT analysis showed that SF-6D was better suited to measure health 
in PWID. More specifically, SF-6D to a larger extent discriminated between 
persons regardless of their health status, while EQ-5D was more suitable to 
detect persons with poorer health. Self-rated HRQoL showed that average QALY was 
lower among PWID compared to the general Swedish population. However, a general 
increase in self-reported health was noted over time among participants.
CONCLUSION: This study increase knowledge of what instruments are most suitable 
to measure health among PWID. This is of great importance when evaluating 
effects of public health and preventive measures in the PWID population.

BACKGROUND: Burns is a type of injury, caused by unintentional exposure to 
substances of high temperature, including hot liquid, solid, and objects 
radiating heat energy, placing a high burden not only on patients' families but 
also on national healthcare systems globally. It is difficult for policymakers 
and clinicians to formulate targeted management strategies for burns because 
data on current epidemiological patterns worldwide are lacking.
METHODS: Data on burns were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2019 Study. The incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and deaths of 
burns in 204 countries and regions from 1990 to 2019 were calculated and 
stratified by sex, age, geographical location, and sociodemographic index (SDI). 
The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of incidence, DALYs, and deaths 
was calculated to evaluate the temporal trends. All analyses were performed 
using R software, version 4.1.1, with 2-sided P-values < .05 indicating a 
statistically significant difference.
RESULTS: A total of 8,378,122 new cases (95% UI, 6,531,887-10,363,109cases) of 
burns were identified globally in 2019, which is almost evenly split between men 
and women, and most of the new cases were concentrated in the 10-19-year age 
group. Besides, burns account for 111,292 deaths (95% UI, 132,392-88,188) 
globally in 2019, most of which were concentrated in those aged 1-4 years. The 
burden of burns measured in DALYs was 7,460,448.65 (95% UI, 
5,794,505.89-9,478,717.81) in 2019, of which 67% and 33% could be attributed to 
YLLs and YLDs, respectively. The EAPC of incidence, DALYs, and deaths were 
negative, the age-standardized rate (ASR) of incidence, DALYs, and deaths were 
considered to be decreasing in most of the regions, and the EAPCs were 
negatively correlated with SDI levels, universal health coverage (UHC), and 
gross domestic product (GDP).
CONCLUSION: Globally, the age-standardized rates of burn incidence, DALYs, and 
mortality, as well as the number of burn DALYs and death cases will continuously 
decrease, but the number of new burn cases has an increasing tendency globally. 
In addition, the EAPCs of burns in incidence, DALYs, and deaths indicated that 
the burden of burns was considered to be decreasing in most of the regions. And 
from the relationship of EAPCs with SDI, UHC index, and GDP, indicate that 
prevention burns not only depend on health spending per capita but also depend 
on the education level per capita and healthcare system performance, but it does 
not mean higher health spending corresponds to higher UHC index, which needs 
high efficiency of translating health spending into individuals health gains.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the mechanisms of low back pain triggered by the 
five-repetition sit-to-stand test (5R-STS test) in degenerative lumbar 
spondylolisthesis (DLS) from radiographic perspective, as well as to determine 
the most useful diagnostic modalities in the evaluation of segmental 
instability.
METHODS: We retrospectively performed a study of 78 patients (23 men and 55 
women) with symptomatic DLS at L4/5 in our institution between April 2020 and 
December 2021. Each patient was assessed by using the 5R-STS test and received a 
series of radiographs including the upright standing, normal sitting, standing 
flexion-extension radiographs, and supine sagittal MR images. Enrolled patients 
were divided into two groups based on the 5R-STS test score: severe group and 
mild group. Translational and angular motion was determined by comparing normal 
sitting radiograph (N) with upright standing radiograph (U) (Combined, NU), 
flexion/extension radiographs (FE) as well as normal sitting radiograph (N) with 
a supine sagittal MR image (sMR) (Combined, N-sMR).
RESULTS: Overall, 78 patients were enrolled, and there were 31(39.7%) patients 
in group S and 47(60.3%) patients in group M, with an average age of 
60.7 ± 8.4 years. The normal sitting radiograph demonstrated the maximum slip 
percentage (SP) and the highest kyphotic angle both in group S and group M. 
Compared with group M, group S revealed significantly higher SP in the normal 
sitting position (24.1 vs 19.6; p = 0.002). The lumbar slip angular in group S 
with a sitting position was significantly higher than that in group M (-5.2 vs 
-1.3; p < 0.001). All patients in group S had objective functional impairment 
(OFI) and 28 patients of them were diagnosed with lumbar instability by using 
the combination of normal sitting radiograph (N) and supine sagittal MR image 
(sMR) (Combined, N-sMR).
CONCLUSION: DLS patients with positive sign of the 5R-STS test is a distinct 
subgroup associated with lumbar instability. The modality of the combination of 
normal sitting radiograph (N) and supine sagittal MR image (sMR) had a 
significant advantage in terms of the ability to identify segmental instability.

BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top ten global public 
health challenges. However, given the lack of a comprehensive assessment of 
worldwide AMR status, our objective is to develop a One Health-based system-wide 
evaluation tool on global AMR.
METHODS: We have further developed the three-hierarchical Global One Health 
Index (GOHI)-AMR indicator scheme, which consists of five key indicators, 17 
indicators, and 49 sub-indicators, by incorporating 146 countries' data from 
diverse authoritative databases, including WHO's Global Antimicrobial Resistance 
and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) and the European CDC. We investigated the 
overall- or sub-rankings of GOHI-AMR at the international/regional/national 
levels for data preprocessing and score calculation utilizing the existing GOHI 
methodology. Additionally, a correlation analysis was conducted between the 
GOHI-AMR and other socioeconomic factors.
RESULTS: The average GOHI-AMR score for 146 countries is 38.45. As expected, 
high-income countries (HICs) outperform the other three income groups on overall 
rankings and all five key indicators of GOHI-AMR, whereas low-income countries 
unexpectedly outperform upper-middle-income countries and lower-middle-income 
countries on the antibiotics-resistant key indicator (ARR) and ARR-subordinate 
indicators, including carbapenem-, β-lactam-, and quinolone resistance, and even 
HICs on aminoglycoside resistance. There were no significant differences among 
the four groups on the environmental-monitoring indicator (P > 0.05). GOHI-AMR 
was positively correlated with gross domestic product, life expectancy, and 
AMR-related publications, but negatively with natural growth rate and chronic 
respiratory disease. In contrast to Cyprus, the remarkably lower prevalence of 
"ESKAPE pathogens" in high-scoring Sweden and Denmark highlights Europe's huge 
gaps. China and Russia outperformed the other three BRICS countries on all key 
indicators, particularly India's ARR and Brazil's AMR laboratory network and 
coordination capacity. Furthermore, significant internal disparities in 
carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevalence were observed between China and the USA, 
with MRSA prevalence both gradually declining, whereas CRKP prevalence has been 
declining in the USA but increasing in China, consistent with higher 
carbapenems-related indicator' performance in USA.
CONCLUSIONS: GOHI-AMR is the most comprehensive tool currently available for the 
assessment of AMR status worldwide. We discovered unique features impacting AMR 
in each country and offered precise recommendations to improve the capacity to 
tackle AMR in low-ranking countries.

The elderly have conventionally been defined as individuals over the age of 65 
and are projected to represent about 21% of the United States (US) population by 
the year 2030. Distal radius fractures (DRF) in particular are one of the most 
common fractures among elderly patients and their incidence continues to rise in 
part due to increased activity levels among the elderly, increased life 
expectancy, rising rates of obesity, changes to dietary habits, and the 
prevalence of osteoporosis. Although various treatment options exist for these 
injuries, nonsurgical treatment of distal radius fractures remains a mainstay 
among elderly patients with mounting evidence of its non-inferiority to surgical 
fixation in the literature. Here, we summarize the overall approach to 
nonsurgical treatment of distal radius fractures in the elderly population while 
examining its supporting data and highlighting potential risks and limitations 
to it.

IMPORTANCE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the standard treatment for 
stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) based on data using 2-dimensional 
conventional radiotherapy. There is limited evidence for the role of 
chemotherapy with use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether concurrent chemotherapy can be safely omitted for 
patients with low-risk stage II/T3N0 NPC treated with IMRT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, open-label, randomized, 
phase 3, noninferiority clinical trial was conducted at 5 Chinese hospitals, 
including 341 adult patients with low-risk NPC, defined as stage II/T3N0M0 
without adverse features (all nodes <3 cm, no level IV/Vb nodes; no extranodal 
extension; Epstein-Barr virus DNA <4000 copies/mL), with enrollment between 
November 2015 and August 2020. The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2022.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive IMRT alone (n = 172) 
or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (IMRT with cisplatin, 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks 
for 3 cycles [n = 169]).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was 3-year failure-free 
survival (time from randomization to any disease relapse or death), with a 
noninferiority margin of 10%. Secondary end points comprised overall survival, 
locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, adverse 
events, and health-related quality of life (QOL) measured by the European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(QLQ-C30; range, 0-100 points; minimum clinically important difference ≥10 for 
physical function, symptom control, or health-related QOL; higher score 
indicates better functioning and global health status or worse symptoms).
RESULTS: Among 341 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 48 [10] years; 30% 
women), 334 (98.0%) completed the trial. Median follow-up was 46 months (IQR, 
34-58). Three-year failure-free survival was 90.5% for the IMRT-alone group vs 
91.9% for the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group (difference, -1.4%; 1-sided 95% 
CI, -7.4% to ∞; P value for noninferiority, <.001). No significant differences 
were observed between groups in overall survival, locoregional relapse, or 
distant metastasis. The IMRT-alone group experienced a significantly lower 
incidence of grade 3 to 4 adverse events (17% vs 46%; difference, -29% [95% CI, 
-39% to -20%]), including hematologic toxicities (leukopenia, neutropenia) and 
nonhematologic toxicities (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, mucositis). 
The IMRT-alone group had significantly better QOL scores during radiotherapy 
including the domains of global health status, social functioning, fatigue, 
nausea and vomiting, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with low-risk NPC, treatment with IMRT 
alone resulted in 3-year failure-free survival that was not inferior to 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: The marginal productivity of a country's healthcare system refers to 
the health gains produced per unit change in the level of spending. In 
budget-constrained settings, this metric reflects the opportunity cost, in terms 
of health gains forgone, of committing additional or existing resources to 
alternative uses within the healthcare system. It can therefore assist in 
evidence-based decisions on whether different interventions represent good value 
for money.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to estimate the marginal productivity of 
the Indonesian healthcare system using subnational data, and to use this to 
inform health opportunity costs in the country.
METHODS: We define a dynamic health production function to model the stream of 
effects of current and prior public health spending decisions on population 
under-five mortality. To estimate the model, we use data from the 33 Indonesian 
provinces for the 2004-2012 period. The estimated elasticity is then translated 
into gains in terms of cost per DALY (disability-adjusted life-year) averted. We 
use dynamic panel data methods to address potential endogeneity issues in the 
model.
RESULTS: Our base-case estimates suggest that a 1% expansion in the level of 
health spending reduces under-five mortality by 0.38% (95% CI 0.00-0.76), which 
translates into a cost of averting one DALY of $235 (2019 US$).
CONCLUSION: With Indonesia aiming for universal health coverage, our results 
support these efforts by highlighting the associated benefits resulting from 
increases in public health expenditure and have the potential to inform the 
decision-making process about a suitable locally relevant cost-effectiveness 
threshold.

Learning objectives (LOs) are used to communicate the purpose of instruction. 
Done well, they convey the expectations that the instructor-and by extension, 
the academic field-has in terms of what students should know and be able to do 
after completing a course of study. As a result, they help students better 
understand course activities and increase student performance on assessments. 
LOs also serve as the foundation of course design, as they help structure 
classroom practices and define the focus of assessments. Understanding the 
research can improve and refine instructor and student use of LOs. This essay 
describes an online, evidence-based teaching guide published by CBE-Life 
Sciences Education (LSE) at http://lse.ascb.org/learning-objectives. The guide 
contains condensed summaries of key research findings organized by 
recommendations for writing and using LOs, summaries of and links to research 
articles and other resources, and actionable advice in the form of a checklist 
for instructors. In addition to describing key features of the guide, we also 
identify areas that warrant further empirical studies.

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered global declines in life 
expectancy. The United States was hit particularly hard among high-income 
countries. Early data from the United States showed that these losses varied 
greatly by race/ethnicity in 2020, with Hispanic and Black Americans suffering 
much larger losses in life expectancy compared with White people. We add to this 
research by examining trends in lifespan inequality, average years of life lost, 
and the contribution of specific causes of death and ages to race/ethnic 
life-expectancy disparities in the United States from 2010 to 2020. We find that 
life expectancy in 2020 fell more for Hispanic and Black males (4.5 and 3.6 y, 
respectively) compared with White males (1.5 y). These drops nearly eliminated 
the previous life-expectancy advantage for the Hispanic compared with the White 
population, while dramatically increasing the already large gap in life 
expectancy between Black and White people. While the drops in life expectancy 
for the Hispanic population were largely attributable to official COVID-19 
deaths, Black Americans saw increases in cardiovascular diseases and "deaths of 
despair" over this period. In 2020, lifespan inequality increased slightly for 
Hispanic and White populations but decreased for Black people, reflecting the 
younger age pattern of COVID-19 deaths for Hispanic people. Overall, the 
mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic hit race/ethnic minorities 
particularly hard in the United States, underscoring the importance of the 
social determinants of health during a public health crisis.
