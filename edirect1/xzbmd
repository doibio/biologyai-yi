There has been a debate on whether cost-effectiveness analysis should consider 
the cost of consumption and leisure time activities when using the 
quality-adjusted life year as a measure of health outcome under a societal 
perspective. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the effects of 
ill health on consumptive activities are spontaneously considered in a health 
state valuation exercise and how much this matters. The survey enrolled patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease in Germany (n = 104). Patients were randomized 
to explicit and no explicit instruction for the consideration of consumption and 
leisure effects in a time trade-off (TTO) exercise. Explicit instruction to 
consider non-health-related utility in TTO exercises did not influence TTO 
scores. However, spontaneous consideration of non-health-related utility in 
patients without explicit instruction (60% of respondents) led to significantly 
lower TTO scores. Results suggest an inclusion of consumption costs in the 
numerator of the cost-effectiveness ratio, at least for those respondents who 
spontaneously consider non-health-related utility from treatment. Results also 
suggest that exercises eliciting health valuations from the general public may 
include a description of the impact of disease on consumptive activities.

This study investigates to what extent physical inactivity in older age is 
associated with reduced life expectancy among non-overweight and 
overweight/obese individuals. Data from 20,203 respondents aged ≥60 years were 
drawn from the Health Survey for England and Scottish Health Surveys (1994-2008) 
and 5-year all-cause mortality linkage. Population attributable fractions were 
calculated to estimate years of life lost due to physical inactivity. Physical 
inactivity was defined as not meeting the current UK physical activity 
guidelines for older adults. Not meeting physical activity guidelines was 
associated with reduced life expectancy that is larger among non-overweight 
individuals than among overweight/obese.

If the prediction of some scientists comes true, then we are only few years away 
from the appearance of the first generation of human beings who will be able to 
add one year to each remaining year of life expectancy. Faced with this 
possibility, it seems appropriate to give thought to the public policies that 
should be adopted. It is better to anticipate the various future scenarios than 
react to a reality which is a fait accompli. To date, the debate has mainly 
focused on the ethical question: is it good or bad for us humans to achieve 
immortal life? Until now, neither legal guidelines at State level nor those of 
international organisations which deal with bioethical issues have concerned 
themselves with this matter. But before discussing policies, two other matters 
should be addressed: first, to show how the prolongation of human life can be as 
much the unwanted outcome of legitimate efforts in search of healthy aging, as 
one of the aims of the post-humanist project; second, to present the most 
consistent and shared ethical reasons for rejecting the human immortality 
project.

cells to detect prostate cancer at initial biopsy.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is predominately a disease of older men, with a 
median age of diagnosis of 68 years and 71% of cancer deaths occurring in those 
over 75 years of age. While prostate cancer screening is not recommended for 
men>70 years, fit elderly men with controlled comorbidities may have a 
relatively long life expectancy. We compare the use of age related PSA with the 
detection of primary malignant circulating prostate cells mCPCs to detect 
clinically significant PC in this population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All men undergoing PC screening with a PSA>4.0 ng/ml 
underwent TRUS 12 core prostate biopsy (PB). Age, PSA, PB results defined as 
cancer/no-cancer, Gleason, number of positive cores and percentage infiltration 
were registered. Men had an 8 ml blood sample taken for mCPC detection; 
mononuclear cells were obtained using differential gel centrifugation and mCPCs 
were identified using immunocytochemistry with anti-PSA and anti-P504S. A mCPC 
was defined as a cell expressing PSA and P504S; a positive test as at least one 
mCPC detected/sample. Diagnostic yields for subgroups were calculated and the 
number of avoided PBs registered. Esptein criteria were used to define small 
grade tumours.
RESULTS: A total of 610 men underwent PB, 398 of whom were aged <70 yrs. Men 
over 70 yrs had: a higher median PSA, 6.24 ng/ml versus 5.59 ng/ml (p=0.04); and 
a higher frequency of cancer detected 90/212 (43%) versus 134/398 (34%) 
(p=0.032). Some 34/134 cancers in men<70 yrs versus 22/90 (24%) of men>70 yrs 
complied with criteria for active surveillance. CPC detection: 154/398 (39%) 
men<70 yrs were CPC (+), specificity for cancer 86%, sensitivity 88%, 14/16 with 
a false (-) result had a small low grade PC. In men>70 years, 88/212 (42%) were 
CPC (+); specificity 92%, sensitivity 87%, 10/12 with a false (-) had small low 
grade tumours. False (+) results were more common in younger men 36/154 versus 
10/88 (p<0.02). With a PSA cutoff of 6.5 ng/ml, in men<70 yrs, 108 PB would be 
avoided, missing 56 cancers of which 48 were clinically significant. Using CPC 
detection, 124 biopsies would be avoided, missing only 2 clinically significant 
cancers. In men>70 yrs using a PSA>6.5 ng/ml would have resulted in 108 PB with 
34 PC detected, of which 14(41%) were small low grade tumours.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of CPC detection in the fit elderly significantly decreases 
the number of PBs without missing clinically significant cancers, indicating 
superiority to the use of age-related PSA.

Many people recognise that mass media is important in promoting public health 
but there have been few attempts to measure how important. An ongoing trial in 
Burkina Faso (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01517230) is an attempt to bring together 
the very different worlds of mass media and epidemiology: to measure rigorously, 
using a cluster-randomised design, how many lives mass media can save in a 
low-income country, and at what cost. Application of the Lives Saved Tool 
predicts that saturation-based media campaigns could reduce child mortality by 
10-20%, at a cost per disability-adjusted life-year that is as low as any 
existing health intervention. In this Viewpoint we explain the scientific 
reasoning behind the trial, while stressing the importance of the media 
methodology used.

Why do lifespan variability trends for the young and old diverge? A perturbation 
analysis.

BACKGROUND: Variation in lifespan has followed strikingly different trends for 
the young and old: while total lifespan variability has decreased as life 
expectancy at birth has risen, the variability conditional on survival to older 
ages has increased. These diverging trends reflect changes in the underlying 
demographic parameters determining age-specific mortality.
OBJECTIVE: We ask why the variation in the ages at death after survival to adult 
ages has followed a different trend than the variation at younger ages, and aim 
to explain the divergence in terms of the age pattern of historical mortality 
changes.
METHODS: Using simulations, we show that the empirical trends in lifespan 
variation are well characterized using the Siler model, which describes the 
mortality trajectory using functions representing early-life, later-life, and 
background mortality. We then obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the Siler 
parameters for Swedish females from 1900 to 2010. We express mortality in terms 
of a Markov chain model, and apply matrix calculus to compute the sensitivity of 
age-specific variance trends to the changes in Siler model parameters.
RESULTS: Our analysis quantifies the influence of changing demographic 
parameters on lifespan variability at all ages, highlighting the influence of 
declining childhood mortality on the reduction of lifespan variability, and the 
influence of subsequent improvements in adult survival on the rising variability 
of lifespans at older ages.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insight into the dynamic relationship 
between the age pattern of survival improvements and time trends in lifespan 
variability.

Literature review of type 2 diabetes mellitus among minority Muslim populations 
in Israel.

Services, Southern District, Beer-Sheva 84105, Israel.

This review surveys the literature published on the characteristics and 
implications of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for the Arab 
and Bedouin populations of Israel. T2DM is a global health problem. The rapid 
rise in its prevalence in the Arab and Bedouin populations in Israel is 
responsible for their lower life expectancy compared to Israeli Jews. The 
increased prevalence of T2DM corresponds to increased rates of obesity in these 
populations. A major risk group is adult Arab women aged 55-64 years. In this 
group obesity reaches 70%. There are several genetic and nutritional 
explanations for this increase. We found high hospitalization rates for micro 
and macrovascular complications among diabetic patients of Arab and Bedouin 
origin. Despite the high prevalence of diabetes and its negative health 
implications, there is evidence that care and counseling relating to nutrition, 
physical activity and self-examination of the feet are unsatisfactory. Economic 
difficulties are frequently cited as the reason for inadequate medical care. 
Other proposed reasons include faith in traditional therapy and misconceptions 
about drugs and their side effects. In Israel, the quality indicators program is 
based on one of the world's leading information systems and deals with the 
management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The program's baseline data 
pointed to health inequality between minority populations and the general 
population in several areas, including monitoring and control of diabetes. Based 
on these data, a pilot intervention program was planned, aimed at minority 
populations. This program led to a decrease in inequality and served as the 
basis for a broader, more comprehensive intervention that has entered the 
implementation stage. Interventions that were shown to be effective in other 
Arabic countries may serve as models for diabetes management in the Arab and 
Bedouin populations in Israel.

Many cellular functions necessary for life are tightly regulated by protein 
allosteric conformational change, and correlated dynamics between protein 
regions has been found to contribute to the function of proteins not previously 
considered allosteric. The ability to map and control such dynamic coupling 
would thus create opportunities for the extension of current therapeutic design 
strategy. Here, we present an approach to determine the networks of residues 
involved in the transfer of correlated motion across a protein, and apply our 
approach to rescue disease-causative mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
regulator (CFTR) ion channels, ΔF508 and ΔI507, which together constitute over 
90% of cystic fibrosis cases. We show that these mutations perturb dynamic 
coupling within the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1), and uncover a 
critical residue that mediates trans-domain coupled dynamics. By rationally 
designing a mutation to this residue, we improve aberrant dynamics of mutant 
CFTR as well as enhance surface expression and function of both mutants, 
demonstrating the rescue of a disease mutation by rational correction of 
aberrant protein dynamics.

OBJECTIVE: Complete and safe resection of sphenocavernous (SC) meningiomas is 
difficult and also a great challenge for neurosurgeons. The goal of our study 
was to report the surgical results and complications for these patients treated 
at our institution as well as trying to find the factors resulted in ptosis 
after the operation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive SC meningiomas cases that 
underwent surgery between April 1997 and December 2012 were reviewed. The 
clinical courses of all patients were recorded. Prognosis factors of 
post-operative ptosis were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 38 female and 11 male patients. Mean duration of symptoms 
was 20.9 months. Visual deficit (34.7%) and headache (22.4%) were the most 
common presenting symptoms. Mean maximum diameter of the tumors on MRI was 5.1 
cm. Subtotal resection was achieved in 51.0% of patients. Follow-up data were 
available for 39 patients, with a mean follow-up of 73.7 months, and four 
patients died during follow-up period. Of the 35 living patients, 22 (62.9%) 
lived a normal life. Univariate analyses showed that factors associated with 
post-operative ptosis included female patient, with primary operation and the 
cavernous extension in Category 3 of Hirsch' grading, while multivariate 
regression analyses showed that only the cavernous extension in Category 3 of 
Hirsch' grading was independently associated with post-operative ptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that the most common complication after the 
SC meningioma surgery is ocular cranial nerve dysfunction, and the only 
significance factor relative to post-operative ptosis is the level of extension 
to the cavernous.

Werner Syndrome-specific induced pluripotent stem cells: recovery of telomere 
function by reprogramming.

Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare human autosomal recessive premature aging 
disorder characterized by early onset of aging-associated diseases, chromosomal 
instability, and cancer predisposition. The function of the DNA helicase encoded 
by WRN, the gene responsible for WS, has been studied extensively. WRN helicase 
is involved in the maintenance of chromosome integrity through DNA replication, 
repair, and recombination by interacting with a variety of proteins associated 
with DNA repair and telomere maintenance. The accelerated aging associated with 
WS is reportedly caused by telomere dysfunction, and the underlying mechanism of 
the disease is yet to be elucidated. Although it was reported that the life 
expectancy for patients with WS has improved over the last two decades, 
definitive therapy for these patients has not seen much development. Severe 
symptoms of the disease, such as leg ulcers, cause a significant decline in the 
quality of life in patients with WS. Therefore, the establishment of new 
therapeutic strategies for the disease is of utmost importance. Induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be established by the introduction of several 
pluripotency genes, including Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-myc into differentiated 
cells. iPSCs have the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types 
that constitute the human body, and possess infinite proliferative capacity. 
Recent studies have reported the generation of iPSCs from the cells of patients 
with WS, and they have concluded that reprogramming represses premature 
senescence phenotypes in these cells. In this review, we summarize the findings 
of WS patient-specific iPSCs (WS iPSCs) and focus on the roles of telomere and 
telomerase in the maintenance of these cells. Finally, we discuss the potential 
use of WS iPSCs for clinical applications.

Systemic mastocytosis in adults: 2015 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, 
and management.

Pardanani A(1).

(1)Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Department of 
Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

DISEASE OVERVIEW: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) results from a clonal proliferation 
of abnormal mast cells (MC) in one or more extracutaneous organs.
DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of 
morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria 
include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or 
CD2, and presence of KITD816V.
RISK STRATIFICATION: The 2008 World Health Organization classification of SM has 
been shown to be prognostically relevant. Classification of SM patients into 
indolent SM (ISM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM associated with a clonal non-MC 
lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), and mast cell leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful 
first step in establishing prognosis.
MANAGEMENT: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a normal 
life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, 
cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients 
have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-α (+/-corticosteroids) can 
control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and 
mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, 
cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC 
debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a 
therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in 
KITD816-unmutated patients. Treatment of SM-AHNMD is governed primarily by the 
non-MC neoplasm; hydroxyurea has modest utility in this setting; there is a role 
for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in select cases. Investigational Drugs: 
Recent data confirms midostaurin's significant anti-MC activity in patients with 
advanced SM.

The main objective of this study was to compare and contrast adolescent and 
adult values for the Child Health Utility-9D (CHU9D), a new generic 
preference-based measure of health-related quality of life designed for 
application in the economic evaluation of treatment and preventive programmes 
for children and adolescents. Previous studies have indicated that there may be 
systematic differences in adolescent and adult values for identical health 
states. An online survey including a series of best-worst scaling discrete 
choice experiment questions for health states defined by the CHU9D was 
administered to two general population samples comprising adults and 
adolescents, respectively. The results highlight potentially important 
age-related differences in the values attached to CHU9D dimensions. Adults, in 
general, placed less weight upon impairments in mental health (worried, sad, 
annoyed) and more weight upon moderate to severe levels of pain relative to 
adolescents. The source of values (adults or adolescents) has important 
implications for economic evaluation and may impact significantly upon 
healthcare policy.

The anti-feeding prophage (Afp), a phage-tail-like particle that causes 
cessation of feeding in the New Zealand grass grub, Costelytra zealandica, is 
encoded by 18 open reading frames (afp1-18). C-terminal truncations of afp14 
resulted in shortened Afp particles, suggesting that Afp14 is involved in Afp 
length determination. We constructed an Afp assembly system (afp1-18), wherein 
Afp14 was truncated after the N-terminal 88 residues. This construct, when 
expressed in trans in Escherichia coli expressing a N-terminal 98-amino acid 
Afp14 construct, yielded fully assembled Afp but no assembled Afp was detected 
in the case of a N-terminal 96-amino acid Afp14 construct. These results 
suggested that the 98 N-terminal, amino acid residues of Afp14 is crucial for 
the initiation of Afp assembly via baseplate formation. Trans-based expression 
of wild-type afp14 resulted in Afp particles of varying lengths, all of which 
were shorter than the wild-type Afp particle. On the other hand, similar 
expression of Afp14 harboring a C-terminal extension (KLLEH(6)) resulted in 
elongated Afp particles. This information, combined with bioinformatics data, 
allowed us to propose a model delineating the mechanism and role of Afp14 in the 
maturation of the Afp particle.

BACKGROUND: An increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with a high risk of 
cardiovascular disease and reduction in life expectancy. However, several 
studies reported improved clinical outcomes in obese patients treated for 
cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study is to investigate the 
impact of BMI on long-term clinical outcomes after implantation of zotarolimus 
eluting stents.
METHODS: Individual patient data were pooled from the RESOLUTE Clinical Program 
comprising five trials worldwide. The study population was sorted according to 
BMI tertiles and clinical outcomes were evaluated at 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Data from a total of 5,127 patients receiving the R-ZES were included 
in the present study. BMI tertiles were as follow: I tertile (≤ 25.95 kg/m(2) 
-Low or normal weight) 1,727 patients; II tertile (>25.95 ≤ 29.74 kg/m(2) 
-overweight) 1,695 patients, and III tertile (>29.74 kg/m(2) -obese) 1,705 
patients. At 2-years follow-up no difference was found for patients with high 
BMI (III tertile) compared with patients with normal or low BMI (I tertile) in 
terms of target lesion failure (I-III tertile, HR [95% CI] = 0.89 [0.69, 1.14], 
P = 0.341; major adverse cardiac events (I-III tertile, HR [95% CI] = 0.90 
[0.72, 1.14], P = 0.389; cardiac death (I-III tertile, HR [95% CI] = 1.20 [0.73, 
1.99], P = 0.476); myocardial infarction (I-III tertile, HR [95% CI] = 0.86 
[0.55, 1.35], P = 0.509; clinically-driven target lesion revascularization 
(I-III tertile, HR [95% CI] = 0.75 [0.53, 1.08], P = 0.123; definite or probable 
stent thrombosis (I-III tertile, HR [95% CI] = 0.98 [0.49, 1.99], P = 0.964.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the patients' body mass index was found to 
have no impact on long-term clinical outcomes after coronary artery 
interventions.

Under-screening for cancer may contribute to a greater disease burden in 
individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) as their life 
expectancy increases. In 2008, the province of Ontario launched Canada's first 
population-based colorectal cancer screening program. Our objectives were to 
compare the proportions of Ontarians with and without IDD who have undergone 
colorectal cancer screening and to examine factors associated with screening 
uptake among Ontarians with IDD. Records for Ontario residents 50-64 years of 
age were linked across various administrative health and social services 
datasets to identify individuals with IDD and to select a random sample of the 
age-equivalent Ontario population without IDD as a comparison group. Logistic 
regression models were fit to examine the odds of screening uptake among 
individuals with IDD while controlling for age, sex, urban or rural residence, 
neighbourhood income quintile, expected use of health care resources, and being 
enrolled with or seeing a physician in a patient enrolment model (any of several 
primary care practice models designed to improve patient access and quality of 
care in Ontario), and to examine the association between these variables and 
colorectal cancer screening in the IDD population. The odds of having had a 
fecal occult blood test in the previous two years and being up-to-date with 
colorectal tests were 32% and 46% lower, respectively, for Ontarians with IDD 
compared to those without IDD. Being older, female, having a greater expected 
use of health care resources, and being enrolled with or seeing a physician in a 
primary care patient enrolment model were all significantly associated with 
higher odds of having been screened for colorectal cancer in the IDD population. 
These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions aimed at making 
colorectal cancer screening more equitable.

BACKGROUND: Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a time-based measure of 
disease burden incorporating both disability and mortality. Our study aimed to 
determine the DALY lost from epilepsy in an Indian metropolis.
METHODS: A population-based prospective study on epilepsy was conducted over 
5 years (2003-8) in Kolkata, India, on randomly selected 100,802 subjects (males 
53,209, females 47,593) to assess prevalence as well as to capture incident 
cases of epilepsy and those incident cases that died. Standard case definitions 
were used. The data were used to estimate years of life lost (YLL) due to 
premature mortality, years of life lived with disability (YLD), and DALY, 
utilizing the prevalence-based Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 approach. 
Age- and gender-specific figures were computed.
RESULTS: During 2003-2004, a total of 476 subjects with active epilepsy were 
detected and the age-adjusted prevalence rate was 4.71 per 1000. Over 5 years, 
there were 197 incident cases of epilepsy of whom 26 died. The age-adjusted 
annual incidence rate of epilepsy was 38.3 per 100,000. The all-cause 
standardized mortality rate (SMR) of epilepsy was 2.4. The burden of epilepsy in 
the year 2007-8 revealed the overall YLL was 755 per 100,000, and the overall 
YLD ranged from 14.45 to 31.0 per 100,000 persons depending on the clinical 
severity of the epilepsy. Both YLL and YLD values were higher in males than in 
females. The overall DALY lost due to epilepsy in 2007-8 was found to be 846.96 
(males 1183.04, females 463.81) per 100,000.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in India to determine the DALY of epilepsy 
using GBD 2010. The results reveal a substantial burden of epilepsy in our 
setting. Similar such studies are needed in other parts of India in both urban 
and rural settings.

Huntington disease (HD) prevalence shows geographic variability and has been 
recently updated by taking into account the mutation diagnostic test. In Italy, 
the last epidemiological estimation was reported well before the HTT gene 
discovery and the availability of the corresponding genetic test. It reported a 
prevalence of affected subjects ranging between 2.3 and 4.8/100,000 in some 
restricted areas of Northern Italy. We have performed a service-based 
epidemiological analysis in a very restricted geographic area named Molise, 
where our institutions currently operate and represent the only point of 
reference for rare neuropsychiatric diseases. The estimated prevalence rate 
found was 10.85/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.20-14.50), remarkably 
higher than that previously described before the gene test analysis was 
available, and expected to an increase of an additional 17% by 2030, because of 
Italian population aging. According to our analysis, we estimate that about 6500 
subjects are currently affected by HD in Italy, and that this number will 
further increase in the next decades because of population aging, variable 
phenotype penetrance and improved life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer has benefited from a number of innovative 
therapeutics over the last decade. Cytotoxics, hormone therapy, targeted 
therapies and biologics can now be given to ensure optimal management of 
patients. As life expectancy of breast cancer patients has been significantly 
stretched and that several lines of treatment are now made available, 
determining the best drug or drug combinations to be primarily given and the 
best dosing and scheduling for each patient is critical for ensuring an optimal 
toxicity/efficacy balance.
AREAS COVERED: Defining patient's characteristics at the tumor level 
(pharmacogenomics) and the constitutional level (pharmacogenetics) is a rising 
trend in oncology. This review covers the latest strategies based upon the 
search of relevant biomarkers for efficacy, resistance and toxicity to be 
undertaken at the bedside to shift towards precision medicine in breast cancer 
patients.
EXPERT OPINION: In the expanding era of bioguided medicine, identifying relevant 
and clinically validated biomarkers from the plethora of published material 
remains an uneasy task. Sorting the variety of genetic and molecular markers 
that have been investigated over the last decade on their level of evidence and 
addressing the issue of drug exposure should help to improve the management of 
breast cancer therapy.

Incorporating ecology and social system into formal hypotheses to guide field 
studies of color vision in primates.

The X-linked gene polymorphism responsible for the variable color vision of most 
Neotropical monkeys and some lemurs is thought to be maintained by balancing 
selection, such that trichromats have an advantage over dichromats for some 
ecologically important task(s). However, evidence for such an advantage in wild 
primate populations is equivocal. The purpose of this study is to refine a 
hypothesis for a trichromat advantage by tailoring it to the ecology of 
territorial primates with female natal dispersal, such that dispersing 
trichromatic females have a foraging and, by extension, survival advantage over 
dichromats. I then examine the most practical way to test this hypothesis using 
field data. Indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis may take the form of 
differences in genotype frequencies among life stages and differences in 
disperser food item encounter rates. A deterministic evolutionary matrix 
population model and a stochastic model of food patch encounter rates are 
constructed to investigate the magnitude of such differences and the likelihood 
of statistical detection using field data. Results suggest that, although the 
sampling effort required to detect the hypothesized genotype frequency 
differences is impractical, a field study of reasonable scope may be able to 
detect differences in disperser foraging rates. This study demonstrates the 
utility of incorporating socioecological details into formal hypotheses during 
the planning stages of field studies of primate color vision.

The mismatch between patient life expectancy and the service life of implantable 
devices in current cardioverter-defibrillator therapy: a call for larger device 
batteries.

In 2005, Bob Hauser published a paper in the Journal of the American College of 
Cardiology entitled "The growing mismatch between patient longevity and the 
service life of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators". Now, nearly a decade 
later, I would like to perform a second look on the problem of a mismatching 
between ICD device service life and the survival of ICD recipients. Since 2005, 
the demographics of the ICD population has changed significantly. Primary 
prevention has become the dominant indication in defibrillator therapy and 
device implantation is indicated more and more in earlier stages of cardiac 
diseases. In former larger scale ICD trials, the patient average 5-year survival 
probability was in a range of 68-71%; in newer CRT-D trials in a range of 
72-88%. Due to a progressively widened ICD indication and implantation 
preferentially performed in patients with better life expectancy, the problem of 
inadequate device service life is of growing importance. The early days of 
defibrillator therapy started with a generator volume of 145 ccm and a device 
service life <18 months. In this early period, the device miniaturization and 
extension of service life were similar challenges for the technicians. Today, we 
have reached a formerly unexpected extent of device miniaturization. However, 
technologic improvements were often preferentially translated in further device 
miniaturization and not in prolonging device service life. In his analysis, Bob 
Hauser reported a prolonged device service life of 2.3 years in ICD models with 
a larger battery capacity of 0.54 up to 0.69 Ah. Between 2008 and 2014, several 
studies had been published on the problem of ICD longevity in clinical 
scenarios. These analyses included "older" and currently used single chamber, 
dual chamber and CRT devices. The reported average 5-year device service life 
ranged from 0 to 75%. Assuming today technology, larger battery capacities will 
only result in minimal increase in device volume. Selected ICD patients may 
further benefit from device miniaturization-but the vast majority may much more 
benefit from a significant prolongation in device service life. All published 
cost-effectiveness analyses in ICD therapy show that device costs and device 
service life are the dominant determinants of the results. The performed "second 
look-nearly a decade later" revealed that there are still relevant limitations 
regarding the device service life in current defibrillator therapy. Technical 
improvements were preferentially transformed into device miniaturization but not 
into prolonging device service life. But this optimization is strongly enforced. 
The most feasible solution might be the use of device batteries with larger 
capacities. The economic burden, mainly caused by non-adequate device service 
life, may limit the future realization of ICD therapy in a progressively growing 
patient population. In the former years, physicians and device manufacturers 
have ignored the patient perspective in defibrillator therapy. However, it is 
the patient viewpoint that prolonged device service life is much more important 
than smaller generator size.

PURPOSE: The addition of bevacizumab to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is a 
standard of care for previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. 
Continuation of bevacizumab beyond progression is an accepted standard of care 
based on a 1.4-month increase in median overall survival observed in a 
randomized trial. No United States-based cost-effectiveness modeling analyses 
are currently available addressing the use of bevacizumab in metastatic 
colorectal cancer. Our objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of 
bevacizumab in the first-line setting and when continued beyond progression from 
the perspective of US payers.
METHODS: We developed two Markov models to compare the cost and effectiveness of 
fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab in the 
first-line treatment and subsequent fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan 
with or without bevacizumab in the second-line treatment of metastatic 
colorectal cancer. Model robustness was addressed by univariable and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Health outcomes were measured in life-years 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Using bevacizumab in first-line therapy provided an additional 0.10 
QALYs (0.14 life-years) at a cost of $59,361. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was $571,240 per QALY. Continuing bevacizumab beyond progression provided 
an additional 0.11 QALYs (0.16 life-years) at a cost of $39,209. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $364,083 per QALY. In univariable sensitivity 
analyses, the variables with the greatest influence on the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio were bevacizumab cost, overall survival, and utility.
CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab provides minimal incremental benefit at high incremental 
cost per QALY in both the first- and second-line settings of metastatic 
colorectal cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis involves the comparison of the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a new technology, which is more costly 
than existing alternatives, with the cost-effectiveness threshold. This 
indicates whether or not the health expected to be gained from its use exceeds 
the health expected to be lost elsewhere as other health-care activities are 
displaced. The threshold therefore represents the additional cost that has to be 
imposed on the system to forgo 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of health 
through displacement. There are no empirical estimates of the cost-effectiveness 
threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To provide a conceptual framework to define the 
cost-effectiveness threshold and to provide the basis for its empirical 
estimation. (2) Using programme budgeting data for the English NHS, to estimate 
the relationship between changes in overall NHS expenditure and changes in 
mortality. (3) To extend this mortality measure of the health effects of a 
change in expenditure to life-years and to QALYs by estimating the 
quality-of-life (QoL) associated with effects on years of life and the 
additional direct impact on QoL itself. (4) To present the best estimate of the 
cost-effectiveness threshold for policy purposes.
METHODS: Earlier econometric analysis estimated the relationship between 
differences in primary care trust (PCT) spending, across programme budget 
categories (PBCs), and associated disease-specific mortality. This research is 
extended in several ways including estimating the impact of marginal increases 
or decreases in overall NHS expenditure on spending in each of the 23 PBCs. 
Further stages of work link the econometrics to broader health effects in terms 
of QALYs.
RESULTS: The most relevant 'central' threshold is estimated to be £12,936 per 
QALY (2008 expenditure, 2008-10 mortality). Uncertainty analysis indicates that 
the probability that the threshold is < £20,000 per QALY is 0.89 and the 
probability that it is < £30,000 per QALY is 0.97. Additional 'structural' 
uncertainty suggests, on balance, that the central or best estimate is, if 
anything, likely to be an overestimate. The health effects of changes in 
expenditure are greater when PCTs are under more financial pressure and are more 
likely to be disinvesting than investing. This indicates that the central 
estimate of the threshold is likely to be an overestimate for all technologies 
which impose net costs on the NHS and the appropriate threshold to apply should 
be lower for technologies which have a greater impact on NHS costs.
LIMITATIONS: The central estimate is based on identifying a preferred analysis
