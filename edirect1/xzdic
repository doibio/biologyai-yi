research that used participatory action. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were 
conducted with the Health Development Army (HDA) leaders, religious leaders, and 
observation of participatory complementary food demonstrations. Cultural 
acceptability and the presence of HDA structure that supports skill development 
were identified as key facilitators to ARF use. On the other hand, the potential 
barriers to expanding ARF skill were lack of sustainability of external skill 
support for HDA leaders, perceived time constraints, unsuitable demonstration 
settings, cooking method, and large group size. The indigenous community's 
knowledge of germination has not been used to improve complementary foods. The 
universal use of ARF requires integration into the Health Extension Programme 
(HEP) with support and supervision for HDA leaders.

Affibody molecules hold great promise as carriers of cytotoxic drugs for cancer 
therapy due to their typically high affinity, easy production, and inherent 
control of the drug molecules' loading and spatial arrangement. Here, the impact 
of increasing the drug load from one to three on the properties of an affibody 
drug conjugate targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was 
investigated. The affibody carrier was recombinantly expressed as a fusion to an 
albumin-binding domain (ABD) for plasma half-life extension. One or three 
cysteine amino acids were placed at the C-terminus to which cytotoxic mcDM1 
molecules were conjugated. The resulting drug conjugates, ZHER2-ABD-mcDM1 and 
ZHER2-ABD-mcDM13, were characterized in vitro, and their biodistribution in mice 
carrying HER2-overexpressing SKOV3 xenografts was determined. Increasing the 
drug load from one to three led to a decrease in affinity for HER2, but a 
significantly more potent cytotoxic effect on SKOV3 cells with high HER2 
expression. The difference in cytotoxic effect on other cell lines with high 
HER2 expression was not significant. In vivo, an increase in drug load led to a 
1.45-fold higher amount of cytotoxic mcDM1 delivered to the tumors. The increase 
in drug load also led to more rapid hepatic clearance, warranting further 
optimization of the molecular design.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) has become more common due 
to higher life expectancy with cystic fibrosis. Early recognition and prompt 
treatment of CFRD leads to improved outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) in order to identify the 
most valuable diagnostic metrics for diagnosing CFRD out of available screening 
tools (index test), using the oral glucose tolerance test as a reference 
standard. Pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and superiority indices 
were calculated and used to rank the index tests.
RESULTS: A total of 31 articles with 25 index tests were eligible for inclusion. 
Two-day, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) ranked the highest (Se: 86% Sp: 
76%), followed by glucose measurement from blood capillary samples (Se: 70%, Sp: 
82%) and three-day CGM (Se: 96%, Sp: 56%). When we compared the CGM of different 
durations, two-day CGM performed best (Se: 88%, Sp: 80%), followed by three-day 
(Se: 96%, Sp: 59%) and six-day CGM (Se: 66%, Sp: 79%).
CONCLUSIONS: Considering its overall performance ranking, as well as the high 
sensitivity, two-day CGM appears to be a promising screening test for CFRD.

A novel drug delivery system preventing Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) recurrence 
after resection surgery is imperatively required to overcome the mechanical 
limitation of the current local drug delivery system and to offer personalised 
treatment options for GBM patients. In this study, 3D printed biodegradable 
flexible porous scaffolds were developed via Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 
three-dimensional (3D) printing technology for the local delivery of curcumin. 
The flexible porous scaffolds were 3D printed with various geometries containing 
1, 3, 5, and 7% (w/w) of curcumin, respectively, using curcumin-loaded 
polycaprolactone (PCL) filaments. The scaffolds were characterised by a series 
of characterisation studies and in vitro studies were also performed including 
drug release study, scaffold degradation study, and cytotoxicity study. The 
curcumin-loaded PCL scaffolds displayed versatile spatiotemporal 
characteristics. The polymeric scaffolds obtained great mechanical flexibility 
with a low tensile modulus of less than 2 MPa, and 4 to 7-fold ultimate tensile 
strain, which can avoid the mechanical mismatch problem of commercially 
available GLIADEL wafer with a further improvement in surgical margin coverage. 
In vitro release profiles have demonstrated the sustained release patterns of 
curcumin with adjustable release amounts and durations up to 77 h. MTT study has 
demonstrated the great cytotoxic effect of curcumin-loaded scaffolds against the 
U87 human GBM cell line. Therefore, 3D printed curcumin-loaded scaffold has 
great promise to provide better GBM treatment options with its mechanical 
flexibility and customisability to match individual needs, preventing 
post-surgery GBM recurrence and eventually prolonging the life expectancy of GBM 
patients.

Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disease which damages articular 
cartilage. In its severe stages, it results in impairments in balance and muscle 
strength loss, which affect daily life activities such as walking or climbing 
stairs. This study sought to investigate associated factors with stair-climbing 
ability in this population, with special interest in measuring the relevance of 
postural balance for this task. Forty-four patients scheduled to undergo 
unilateral total knee arthroplasty were assessed. Timed up and go test, stair 
ascent-descent test, three different isometric strength tests (knee flexion, 
knee extension and hip abduction), active knee extension and flexion range of 
movement and static postural balance assessment were evaluated. Spearman's 
correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression analysis determined the 
strength of association between the different variables and stair-climbing time. 
No significant association between the stair-climbing time and static balance 
was found. Significant associations were found between stair-climbing time and 
timed up and go (r = 0.71; p < 0.0001) and maximal knee extensor strength (r = 
-0.52; p = 0.0003). One-year increase in age was associated with 0.15 s (95% CI 
0.00 to 0.30) slower stair-climbing time. In conclusion, muscle strength is more 
important than postural balance for stair-climbing ability in this population.

Background and Objectives: Reduction of health inequalities is a highly 
important task in public health policies worldwide. In Lithuania, inequalities 
in life expectancy (LE) by education level are among the greatest, compared to 
other European countries. However, studies on inequalities in LE by level of 
education over a long-term period are quite scarce in Lithuania. The aim of the 
study was to analyze inequalities in life expectancy by education and its 
changes in Lithuania during 2001-2014. Materials and Methods: Information on 
deaths (in population aged ≥30 years) was obtained from Statistics Lithuania. 
Life expectancy at age 30 (LE30) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated using life tables. Inequalities in LE30 were assessed using rate 
differences. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess the trends and 
inequalities of LE30 during 2001-2014. Results: During 2001-2014, LE30 in males 
and females with post-secondary education was higher than in those with 
up-to-secondary education (p < 0.05). Among males and females, LE30 increased in 
both education groups, except for males with up-to-secondary education. Among 
individuals with post-secondary education, LE30 started increasing earlier and 
more quickly than in those with up-to-secondary education. Over the analyzed 
period, greater differences in LE30 between post-secondary and up-to-secondary 
education groups were found among males. Differences in LE30 due to different 
educational background were statistically significantly, increasing across the 
sexes with a more rapid increase for females than for males. During 2001 and 
2014, the highest number of years of LE30 lost in both education groups was due 
to cardiovascular diseases. Conclusions: Throughout the period of 2001-2014, 
life expectancy in Lithuania in the post-secondary education group was 
statistically significantly longer and was increasing more rapidly compared to 
the up-to secondary education group. Inequalities in life expectancy by level of 
education significantly increased among both males and females.

Over the last months, as oncology specialists, we have frequently been contacted 
for estimating prognosis for cancer patients affected by COVID-19 infection. 
Until now, there have been no clear markers to guide decision making regarding 
the appropriateness of invasive ventilation in cancer patients affected by 
COVID-19 infection. We developed a practical tool encompassing a prognostic 
score, "The Milano Policlinico ONCOVID-ICU score." The score is composed of 
three groups of variables: patient's characteristics such as sex, age, BMI, and 
comorbidities; oncological variables (treatment intent, life expectancy, on or 
off-treatment status); and clinical parameters in association with laboratory 
values (the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer). The 
SOFA score includes six different clinical parameters and during the first few 
days of ICU admissions has an important prognostic role. The oncological history 
should never represent, per se, a contraindication to intensive care and must be 
considered together with other variables, such as laboratory values, clinical 
parameters, and patient characteristics, in order to make the hardest but best 
possible choice. To our knowledge, "The Milano Policlinico ONCOVID-ICU score" is 
the first prognostic score proposed in this setting of patients and requires 
further validation. This tool may be useful to assess the prognosis of cancer 
patients in critical conditions.

We investigated the combined effect of using slightly acidic electrolyzed water 
(SAEW), ultrasounds (US), and ultraviolet-C light-emitting diodes (UV-C LED; 275 
nm) for decreasing pathogenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (SEA) 
in fresh-cut vegetables, including carrots, celery, paprika, and cabbage. 
Survival of pathogenic E. coli and SEA and quality properties of fresh-cut 
vegetables at 5 and 15 °C for 7 days were also investigated. When combined 
treatment (SAEW + US + UV-C LED) was applied to fresh-cut vegetables for 3 min, 
its microbial reduction effect was significantly higher (0.97~2.17 log CFU/g) 
than a single treatment (p < 0.05). Overall, the reduction effect was more 
significant for SEA than for pathogenic E. coli. At 5 °C, SAEW + US and SAEW + 
US + UV-C LED treatments reduced populations of pathogenic E. coli and SEA in 
all vegetables. At 15 °C, SAEW + US + UV-C LED treatment inhibited the growth of 
both pathogens in carrot and celery and extended the shelf life of fresh-cut 
vegetables by preventing color changes in all vegetables. Although the effects 
of treatments varied depending on the characteristics of the vegetables and 
pathogens, UV-C LED can be suggested as a new hurdle technology in fresh-cut 
vegetable industry.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic disease that mainly affects the 
respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. No curative treatments are available, 
but the follow-up in specialized centers has greatly improved the patient life 
expectancy. Robust biomarkers are required to monitor the disease, guide 
treatments, stratify patients, and provide outcome measures in clinical trials. 
In the present study, we outline a strategy to select putative DNA methylation 
biomarkers of lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis patients. In the 
discovery step, we selected seven potential biomarkers using a genome-wide DNA 
methylation dataset that we generated in nasal epithelial samples from the 
MethylCF cohort. In the replication step, we assessed the same biomarkers using 
sputum cell samples from the MethylBiomark cohort. Of interest, DNA methylation 
at the cg11702988 site (ATP11A gene) positively correlated with lung function 
and BMI, and negatively correlated with lung disease severity, P. aeruginosa 
chronic infection, and the number of exacerbations. These results were 
replicated in prospective sputum samples collected at four time points within an 
18-month period and longitudinally. To conclude, (i) we identified a DNA 
methylation biomarker that correlates with CF severity, (ii) we provided a 
method to easily assess this biomarker, and (iii) we carried out the first 
longitudinal analysis of DNA methylation in CF patients. This new epigenetic 
biomarker could be used to stratify CF patients in clinical trials.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the United States has 
disproportionately impacted communities of color across the country. Focusing on 
COVID-19-attributable mortality, we expand upon a national comparative analysis 
of years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to COVID-19 by 
race/ethnicity (Bassett et al., 2020), estimating percentages of total YPLL for 
non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Asians, and 
non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives, contrasting them with their 
respective percent population shares, as well as age-adjusted YPLL rate 
ratios-anchoring comparisons to non-Hispanic Whites-in each of 45 states and the 
District of Columbia using data from the National Center for Health Statistics 
as of 30 December 2020. Using a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to 
perform estimation, our results reveal substantial racial/ethnic disparities in 
COVID-19-attributable YPLL across states, with a prevailing pattern of 
non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing disproportionately high and 
non-Hispanic Whites experiencing disproportionately low COVID-19-attributable 
YPLL. Furthermore, estimated disparities are generally more pronounced when 
measuring mortality in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting the 
greater intensity of the disparities at younger ages. We also find substantial 
state-to-state variability in the magnitudes of the estimated racial/ethnic 
disparities, suggesting that they are driven in large part by social 
determinants of health whose degree of association with race/ethnicity varies by 
state.

The use of preventive health services is a long-term health investment due to 
its potential to help individuals to take care of their health. This study aimed 
to explore the availability and performance of health services in primary health 
care (PHC) in the domain of general practice (GP), pediatrics, and gynecology, 
as well as to analyze the influence of sociodemographic and health determinants 
on the utilization of preventive health services. This descriptive study used 
data from the National Health Insurance Fund and the Statistical Office of the 
Republic of Serbia for 2015 and included 149 independent PHC units. The 
relationship between the utilization of preventive services and sociodemographic 
and health characteristics of the population was analyzed by bivariate and 
multivariate linear regression models. The higher health expenditure per capita 
and noncommunicable diseases mortality rate were, the more preventive health 
services were provided by a chosen GP. Children with a higher completion rate of 
primary school (p = 0.024), higher health expenditure (p = 0.017), and higher 
life expectancy at birth (p = 0.041) had more preventive health services. The 
fertility rate was positively associated with the number of preventive health 
services per 1000 women (p = 0.033). Our findings should serve as a starting 
point for where efforts should be made to achieve better health outcomes.

In order to improve the durability of the asphalt pavement on a cement concrete 
bridge, this study investigated the effect of the modulus of the asphalt mixture 
at the bottom layer on the mechanical response of bridge pavement, along with a 
type of emerging bridge pavement structure. In addition, the design method and 
pavement performance of a high-modulus asphalt mixture were investigated using 
laboratory and field tests, and the life expectancy of the deck pavement 
structure was predicted based on the rutting deformation. The results showed 
that the application of a high-modulus asphalt mixture as the bottom asphalt 
layer decreased the stress level of the pavement structure. The new high-modulus 
asphalt mixture displayed excellent comprehensive performance, i.e., the dynamic 
stability reached 9632 times/mm and the fatigue life reached 1.65 million 
cycles. Based on the rutting depth prediction, using high-modulus mixtures for 
the bridge pavement prolonged the service life from the original 5 years to 10 
years, which significantly enhanced the durability of the pavement structure. 
These research results could be of potential interest for practical applications 
in the construction industry.

OBJECTIVE: The benefit of preventive treatment for superior mesenteric artery 
(SMA) stenosis remains uncertain. The latest European Society for Vascular 
Surgery (ESVS) guidelines remain unclear given the lack of data in the 
literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate asymptomatic SMA stenosis 
prognosis according to the presence of associated coeliac artery (CA) and/or 
inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) stenosis.
METHODS: This was a single academic centre retrospective study. The entire 
computed tomography (CT) database of a single tertiary hospital was reviewed 
from 2009 to 2016. Two groups were defined: patients with isolated > 70% SMA 
stenosis (group A) and patients with both SMA and CA and/or IMA > 70% stenosis 
(group B). Patient medical histories were reviewed to determine the occurrence 
of mesenteric disease (MD) defined as development of acute mesenteric ischaemia 
(AMI) or chronic mesenteric ischaemia (CMI).
RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included. Median follow up was 39 months. 
There were 24 patients in group A and 53 patients in group B. In group B, eight 
(10.4%) patients developed MD with a median onset of 50 months. AMI occurred in 
five patients with a median of 33 months and CMI in three patients with a median 
of 88 months. Patients of group B developed more MD (0% vs. 15.1%; p = .052). 
The five year survival rate was 45% without significant difference between 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Patients with SMA stenosis associated with CA and/or IMA seem to 
have a higher risk of developing mesenteric ischaemia than patients with 
isolated SMA stenosis. Considering the low life expectancy of these patients, 
cardiovascular risk factor assessment and optimisation of medical treatment is 
essential. Preventive endovascular revascularisation could be discussed for 
patients with non-isolated > 70% SMA stenosis, taking into account life 
expectancy.

An expanded and folded neocortex is characteristic of higher mammals, including 
humans and other primates. The neocortical surface area was dramatically 
enlarged during the course of mammalian brain evolution from lissencephalic to 
gyrencephalic mammals, and this bestowed higher cognitive functions especially 
to primates, including humans. In this study, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice 
in which the expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) could be controlled in neural 
stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitors by using the Tet-on system. Shh 
overexpression during embryogenesis promoted the symmetric proliferative 
division of NSCs in the neocortical region, leading to the expansion of lateral 
ventricles and tangential extension of the ventricular zone. Moreover, 
Shh-overexpressing Tg mice showed dramatic expansion of the neocortical surface 
area and exhibited a wrinkled brain when overexpression was commenced at early 
stages of neural development. These results indicate that Shh is able to 
increase the neocortical NSCs and contribute to expansion of the neocortex.

PURPOSE: Spaceflight impairs physical capacity. Here we assessed the protective 
effect of artificial gravity (AG) on aerobic exercise capacity and muscle 
function during bed rest, a spaceflight analogue.
METHODS: 24 participants (33 ± 9 years, 175 ± 9 cm, 74 ± 10 kg, 8 women) were 
randomly allocated to one of three groups: continuous AG (cAG), intermittent AG 
(iAG) or control (CTRL). All participants were subjected to 60 days of 
six-degree head-down tilt bed rest, and subjects of the intervention groups 
completed 30 min of centrifugation per day: cAG continuously and iAG for 
6 × 5 min, with an acceleration of 1g at the center of mass. Physical capacity 
was assessed before and after bed rest via maximal voluntary contractions, 
cycling spiroergometry, and countermovement jumps.
RESULTS: AG had no significant effect on aerobic exercise capacity, flexor 
muscle function and isometric knee extension strength or rate of force 
development (RFD). However, AG mitigated the effects of bed rest on jumping 
power (group * time interaction of the rmANOVA p < 0.001; iAG - 25%, cAG - 26%, 
CTRL - 33%), plantar flexion strength (group * time p = 0.003; iAG - 35%, cAG 
- 31%, CTRL - 48%) and plantar flexion RFD (group * time p = 0.020; iAG - 28%, 
cAG - 12%, CTRL - 40%). Women showed more pronounced losses than men in jumping 
power (p < 0.001) and knee extension strength (p = 0.010).
CONCLUSION: The AG protocols were not suitable to maintain aerobic exercise 
capacity, probably due to the very low cardiorespiratory demand of this 
intervention. However, they mitigated some losses in muscle function, 
potentially due to the low-intensity muscle contractions during centrifugation 
used to avoid presyncope.

Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have emerged as a versatile means for osteoporosis 
treatment and prevention. However, its optimal application parameters are still 
elusive. Here, we optimized the frequency parameter first by cell culture 
screening and then by animal experiment validation. Osteoblasts isolated from 
newborn rats (ROBs) were exposed 90 min/day to 1.8 mT SEMFs at different 
frequencies (ranging from 10 to 100 Hz, interval of 10 Hz). SEMFs of 1.8 mT 
inhibited ROB proliferation at 30, 40, 50, 60 Hz, but increased proliferation at 
10, 70, 80 Hz. SEMFs of 10, 50, and 70 Hz promoted ROB osteogenic 
differentiation and mineralization as shown by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
activity, calcium content, and osteogenesis-related molecule expression 
analyses, with 50 Hz showing greater effects than 10 and 70 Hz. Treatment of 
young rats with 1.8 mT SEMFs at 10, 50, or 100 Hz for 2 months significantly 
increased whole-body bone mineral density (BMD) and femur microarchitecture, 
with the 50 Hz group showing the greatest effect. Furthermore, 1.8 mT SEMFs 
extended primary cilia lengths of ROBs and increased protein kinase A (PKA) 
activation also in a frequency-dependent manner, again with 50 Hz SEMFs showing 
the greatest effect. Pretreatment of ROBs with the PKA inhibitor KT5720 
abolished the effects of SEMFs to increase primary cilia length and promote 
osteogenic differentiation/mineralization. These results indicate that 1.8 mT 
SEMFs have a frequency window effect in promoting osteogenic 
differentiation/mineralization in ROBs and bone formation in growing rats, which 
involve osteoblast primary cilia length extension and PKA activation.

The patient's right to know his/her clinical information corresponds with the 
duty of the health care professional, especially the physician responsible for 
his/her care, to provide it. However, in the case of patients whose life 
prognosis is limited, this presents several difficulties. Determining the 
content of this right is complicated because it depends on the circumstances. 
This favors the conspiracy of silence, the main cause of which can be found in 
the maintenance of the patient's hope. However, condemning the patient to a 
false hope prevents him/her from developing a grieving process, that requires 
renouncing that hope and embracing another undetermined hope of open content. In 
this work we try to outline the structure of this dialectical process, which can 
be explained, in narrative terms, through the structure of the heroic myth, 
which is functional even when the energetic structure of the moral character is 
missing and which is adjustable for each person.

Bone fragility is one of the possible complications of diabetes, either type 1 
(T1D) or type 2 (T2D). Bone fragility can affect patients of different age and 
with different disease severity depending on type of diabetes, disease duration 
and the presence of other complications. Fracture risk assessment should be 
started at different stages in the natural history of the disease depending on 
the type of diabetes and other risk factors. The risk of fracture in T1D is 
higher than in T2D, imposing a much earlier screening and therapeutic 
intervention that should also take into account a patient's life expectancy, 
diabetes complications etc. The therapeutic armamentarium for T2D has been 
enriched with drugs that may influence bone metabolism, and clinicians should be 
aware of these effects. Considering the complexity of diabetes and osteoporosis 
and the range of variables that influence treatment choices in a given 
individual, the Working Group on bone fragility in patients with diabetes 
mellitus has identified and issued recommendations based on the variables that 
should guide screening of bone fragility and management of diabetes and bone 
fragility: (A)ge, (B)MD, (C)omplications, (D)uration of disease, & (F)ractures 
(ABCD&F). Consideration of these parameters may help clinicians identify the 
best time for screening, the appropriate glycaemic target and anti-osteoporosis 
drug for patients with diabetes at risk of or with bone fragility.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of different fertility options in 
men who have undergone vasectomy in couples with a female of advanced maternal 
age (AMA). The options include vasectomy reversal (VR), sperm retrieval (SR) 
with in vitro fertilization (IVF), and the combination of VR and SR with IVF, 
which is a treatment pathway that has been understudied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using TreeAge software, a model-based cost-utility 
analysis was performed estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) in couples with infertility due to vasectomy and advanced female age over 
a period of one year. The model stratified for female age (35-37, 38-40, >40) 
and evaluated four strategies: VR followed by natural conception (NC), SR with 
IVF, VR and SR followed by failed NC and then IVF, and VR and SR followed by 
failed IVF and then NC. QALY estimates and outcome probabilities were obtained 
from the literature and average patient charges were calculated from high-volume 
centers.
RESULTS: The most cost-effective fertility strategy was to undergo VR and try 
for NC (cost-per-QALY: $7,150 (35-37 y), $7,203 (38-40 y), and $7,367 (>40 y)). 
The second most cost-effective strategy was the "back-up vasectomy reversal": 
undergo VR and SR, attempt IVF and switch to NC if IVF fails.
CONCLUSION: In couples with a history of vasectomy and female of AMA, it is most 
cost-effective to undergo a VR. If the couple opts for SR for IVF, it is more 
cost-effective to undergo a concomitant VR than SR alone.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The purpose of this expert review is to describe the current 
methodologies available to manage malignant alimentary tract obstructions as 
well the evidence behind the various methods (including their efficacy and 
safety), indications, and appropriate timing of interventions.
METHODS: This is not a formal systematic review but is based on a review of the 
literature to provide best practice advice statements. No formal rating of the 
quality of evidence or strength of recommendation is carried out. BEST PRACTICE 
ADVICE 1: For all patients with alimentary tract obstruction, the decision about 
specific interventions should be made in a multidisciplinary setting including 
oncologists, surgeons, and endoscopists and take into account the 
characteristics of the obstruction, patient's expectations, prognosis, expected 
subsequent therapies, and functional status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: For 
patients who present with esophageal obstruction from esophageal cancer and who 
are potential candidates for resection or chemoradiation, clinicians should not 
routinely insert a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) without multidisciplinary 
review because of high rates of stent migration, higher morbidity and mortality, 
and potentially lower R0 (microscopically negative margins) resection rates. 
BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: For patients who present with esophageal obstruction 
from esophageal cancer who are potential candidates for resection and who have 
concerns of malnutrition, clinicians may consider the use of enteral feeding 
tubes (via nasogastric or percutaneous route). Clinicians should be aware of the 
potential risk of abdominal wall tumor seeding as well as making subsequent 
gastric conduit formation difficult with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy 
placement. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: For patients who present with esophageal 
obstruction from esophageal cancer who are not candidates for resection, 
clinicians should consider either SEMS insertion or brachytherapy as sole 
therapy or in combination. Clinicians should not consider the use of laser 
therapy or photodynamic therapy because of the lack of evidence of better 
outcomes and superior alternatives. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: For patients with 
malignant esophageal obstruction who are undergoing SEMS placement, clinicians 
should use a fully covered or partially covered SEMS and not an uncovered SEMS, 
with consideration of a stent-anchoring/fixation method. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: 
For patients with gastric outlet obstruction who have a life expectancy greater 
than 2 months, have good functional status, and who are surgically fit, surgical 
gastrojejunostomy should be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: For patients 
with gastric outlet obstruction who are undergoing surgical gastrojejunostomy, a 
laparoscopic approach is favored over an open approach because of lower blood 
loss and shorter hospital stay. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: For patients with 
gastric outlet obstruction who are not candidates for gastrojejunostomy 
(surgical or endoscopic ultrasound-guided), clinicians should consider the 
insertion of an enteral stent. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Enteral stents should not 
be used in patients with multiple luminal obstructions or severely impaired 
gastric motility because of the limited benefit in these scenarios. Clinicians 
can consider placement of a venting gastrostomy in these patients. BEST PRACTICE 
ADVICE 10: Depending on the experience of the endoscopist, endoscopic 
ultrasound-guided gastrojejunostomy is an acceptable alternative to surgical 
gastrojejunostomy and enteral stent placement. Clinicians should be aware that 
there are currently no dedicated Food and Drug Administration-approved devices 
for endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastrojejunostomy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: For 
patients with malignant colonic obstruction who are candidates for resection, 
insertion of SEMS is a reasonable choice as a "bridge to surgery" to allow for 
one-stage, elective resection. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: For patients with 
malignant colonic obstruction who are not candidates for resection, either SEMS 
placement or a diverting colostomy are reasonable choices depending on the 
patient's goals and functional status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: SEMS is a 
reasonable option for patients with proximal (or right-sided) malignant 
obstructions, both as a "bridge to surgery" and in the palliative setting. BEST 
PRACTICE ADVICE 14: SEMS placement is a reasonable alternative for patients with 
extracolonic malignancy who are not candidates for surgery, although their 
placement is more technically challenging, clinical success rates are more 
variable, and complications (including stent migration) are more frequent.
