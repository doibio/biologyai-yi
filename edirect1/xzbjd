BACKGROUND: Health impact assessment (HIA) studies are increasingly predicting 
the health effects of mode shifts in traffic. The challenge for such studies is 
to combine the health effects, caused by injuries, with the disease driven 
health effects, and to express the change in the health with a common health 
indicator. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) combines years lived disabled or 
injured (YLD) and years of life lost (YLL) providing practical indicator to 
combine injuries with diseases. In this study, we estimate the average YLDs for 
one person injured in a transport crash to allow easy to use methods to predict 
health effects of transport injuries.
METHODS: We calculated YLDs and YLLs for transport fatalities and injuries based 
on the data from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA). In 
STRADA, all the fatalities and most of the injuries in Sweden for 2007-2011 were 
recorded. The type of injury was recorded with the Abbreviated Injury Scale 
(AIS) codes. In this study these AIS codes were aggregated to injury types, and 
YLDs were calculated for each victim by multiplying the type of injury with the 
disability weight and the average duration of that injury. YLLs were calculated 
by multiplying the age of the victim with life expectancy of that age and 
gender. YLDs and YLLs were estimated separately for different gender, mode of 
transport and location of the crash.
RESULTS: The average YLDs for injured person was 14.7 for lifelong injuries and 
0.012 for temporal injuries. The average YLDs per injured person for lifelong 
injuries for pedestrians, cyclists and car occupants were 9.4, 12.8 and 18.4, 
YLDs, respectively. Lifelong injuries sustained in rural areas were on average 
31% more serious than injuries in urban areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that shifting modes of transport will not only 
change the likelihood of injuries but also the severity of injuries sustained, 
if injured. The results of this study can be used to predict DALY changes in HIA 
studies that take into account mode shifts between different transport modes, 
and in other studies predicting the health effects of traffic injuries.

Deaths: final data for 2007.

Xu J, Kochanek KD, Murphy SL, Tejada-Vera B.

Objectives-This report presents final 2007 data on U.S. deaths, death rates, 
life expectancy, infant and maternal mortality, and trends by selected 
characteristics such as age, sex, Hispanic origin, race, marital status, 
educational attainment, injury at work, state of residence, and cause of death. 
Methods-Information reported on death certificates, which are completed by 
funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners, is 
presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state 
registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database 
through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death 
are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 
Tenth Revision. Results-In 2007, a total of 2,423,712 deaths were reported in 
the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 760.2 deaths per 100,000 
standard population, a decrease of 2.1 percent from the 2006 rate and a record 
low historical figure. Life expectancy at birth rose 0.2 year, from a 2006 value 
of 77.7 years to a record 77.9 in 2007. Age-specific death rates decreased for 
most age groups-15-24, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and over-and 
remained unchanged for the age groups of under age 1, 1-4, 5-14, and 25-34. The 
15 leading causes of death in 2007 remained the same as in 2006 with the 
exception of two causes that exchanged ranks. Alzheimer's disease, the seventh 
leading cause of death in 2006, became the sixth leading cause in 2007, and 
Diabetes mellitus, the sixth leading cause in 2006, dropped to the seventh 
leading cause in 2007. Heart disease and cancer continued to be the leading and 
second-leading causes of death, respectively, together accounting for almost 
one-half of all deaths (48.6 percent). The infant mortality rate in 2007 was 
6.75 deaths per 1,000 live births. Conclusions-Mortality patterns in 2007, such 
as the decline in the age-adjusted death rate to a record historical low, were 
generally consistent with long-term trends. Life expectancy reached a record 
high in 2007, increasing 0.2 year from 2006.

The research to practice column is intended to improve the research critique 
skills of the advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) and to assist with the 
translation of research into practice. This column critiques the findings from a 
meta-analysis, "Gait speed and survival in older adults," by S. Studenski et al. 
(2011). The study was designed to assess the use of gait speed as a physical 
performance measure that is associated with survival. The findings are reviewed 
in the context of increasing emergency department (ED) visits among older adults 
and their unique assessment needs, with implications for APRN best care 
practices. The implementation of gait speed as a screening tool for identifying 
adults 65 years of age and older in the ED who may be at risk for adverse events 
and functional decline will also be discussed.

Metabolic disorders in patients operated for pancreatic cancer.

Timofte D, Livadariu R, Bintintan V, Diaconu C, Ionescu L, Sandberg AA, Mariciuc 
DC, Dănilă R.

Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas presents a major threat with a 5-years survival 
rate of 5%. Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard procedure for 
cephalo-pancreatic neoplasm. After an extended resection and reconstruction of 
superior gastrointestinal tract the digestive physiology might be heavily 
disrupted. A literature review of metabolic alterations of patients who suffered 
a major pancreatic resection is performed, regarding micronutrients, lipid 
absorption and pancreatogenic diabetes. Long-term survivors following PD 
generally have a satisfactory nutritional status although with subclinical iron, 
vitamin D and selenium deficiency. These patients should be followed-up also 
regarding these micronutrients and properly dietary supplemented when necessary, 
also considering the increased life expectancy. Approximately 17-25% of patients 
will develop insulin-dependent diabetes but pancreatogenic diabetics have 
elevated levels of serum insulin and minimal or absent response to food intake, 
as opposed to a type I diabetics, where insulin serum is normal or elevated and 
there is an exaggerated response to ingestion of sugar.

Epidemiological evaluation regarding the role of cystic fibrosis as a risk 
factor for child malnutrition.

Florescu L, Paduraru DT, Mîndru DE, Temneanu OR, Petrariu FD, Matei MC.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenic autosomal recessive disorder 
with progressive chronic evolution which is potentially lethal. Poor growth is a 
characteristic of children suffering from cystic fibrosis. A poor nutritional 
status is an independent risk factor for inadequate survival in cystic fibrosis 
and is associated with disease complications. The appropriate nutritional 
management is an important part of the treatment so that the patient with cystic 
fibrosis can achieve normal growth and development and maintain the best 
possible health status. A balanced diet supplemented with snacks high in fat and 
calories is necessary to increase the caloric intake in children with cystic 
fibrosis. Children with cystic fibrosis have higher caloric needs than healthy 
children of the same age and sex. Malnutrition in CF is multifactorial. Cystic 
fibrosis is a complex multisystem disorder affecting mainly the gastrointestinal 
tract and respiratory system. In the past, malnutrition was an inevitable 
consequence of disease progression, leading to poor growth, impaired respiratory 
muscle function, decreased exercise tolerance and immunological impairment. A 
positive association between body weight and height and survival has been widely 
reported. The energy requirements of patients with CF vary widely and generally 
increase with age and disease severity. Cystic fibrosis remains a paediatric 
disorder which is often underdiagnosed but which, if therapeutically managed 
properly (by means of drug therapy as well as by appropriate physiotherapy 
techniques), can lead to improved quality of life and, thus, to a bigger life 
expectancy.

The New Demographic Transition: Most Gains in Life Expectancy Now Realized Late 
in Life.

The share of increases in life expectancy realized after age 65 was only about 
20 percent at the beginning of the 20th century for the US and 16 other 
countries at comparable stages of development; but that share was close to 80 
percent by the dawn of the 21st century, and is almost certainly approaching 100 
percent asymptotically. This new demographic transition portends a diminished 
survival effect on working life. For high-income countries at the forefront of 
the longevity transition, expected lifetime labor force participation as a 
percent of life expectancy is declining. Innovative policies are needed if 
societies wish to preserve a positive relationship running from increasing 
longevity to greater prosperity.

It is frequently necessary to admit critically ill elderly patients to intensive 
care units (ICUs) due to their physiological impairments and co-morbidities. 
Several life-sustaining therapies such as mechanical ventilation are performed 
as necessary treatment in these ICUs. Sometimes renal replacement therapy (i.e. 
dialysis) is considered for elderly patients with complicating serious renal 
insufficiency. However, although the necessity for dialysis is recognized, some 
elderly patients may not benefit from this care because of their limited life 
expectancy. Until recently, life-sustaining support for critically ill elderly 
patients in Japan has been used routinely, regardless of the medical futility. 
The issue of providing better end-of-life care for elderly patients even in the 
ICU is now being raised frequently. We therefore wish to highlight the issue of 
end-of-life care and decision-making in the ICU, focusing on nondialytic therapy 
(NDT). The aim of this article was to assess whether NDT is an acceptable 
optional care for critically ill elderly patients with serious kidney diseases, 
even in the ICU. We hope our experiences may be helpful to physicians with an 
interest in decision-making and end-of-life care.

BACKGROUND: The goal of treating chronic diseases, including hematologic 
malignancies, is to increase patients' life span and to improve their 
capabilities as much as possible; so that patients could maintain an appropriate 
level of quality of life (QoL) and continue their lives. Most studies performed 
to evaluate the treatment of various diseases were mostly focused on the 
increase of life expectancy regardless of the QoL and treatment issues. 
Furthermore, fatigue is one of the most common and distressing side effects of 
cancer and treatments related to it, which can affect a patient's QoL, and be 
followed by many problems. This study was designed and implemented with the aim 
to determine the factors affecting the QoL and fatigue in patients with leukemia 
undergoing chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional correlation 
descriptive-analytical study. One hundred and fifteen patients with leukemia 
referred to Sayyed-Al-Shohada Hospital were enrolled in the study through 
convenient sampling method. To collect data, a three-part questionnaire was 
used: The first part was related to demographic characteristics and 
disease-related data and the second part was the fatigue check list and the 
third part was the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) related to QoL. The data 
were analyzed after collection and coding through Software SPSS version 18 and 
descriptive and analytical statistics (analysis of variance test, independent t 
test, Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficient) with 95% confidence 
interval.
RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant correlation between QoL 
in Physical Component Summary with gender (P = 0.03), educational level (P = 
0.09), and marital status (P = 0.004), Also there was a significant correlation 
between QoL in Mental Component Summary with educational level (P = 0.01) and 
economic status (P = 0.02). Findings showed that there was a significant 
correlation between fatigue and marital status (P = 0.005). But statistically 
there was no significant correlation between demographic variables such as age, 
educational level, and employment status with patients' fatigue. Spearman 
correlation coefficient showed that there was a significant correlation between 
fatigues with pain (P = 0.005). Also findings revealed the statistically 
significant correlation between fatigues with economic status (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: According to the present results, it seems that some demographic 
factors affect QoL and significant relationship exists between them. Fatigue in 
patients with leukemia dramatically affects their QoL. Therefore, it is 
important for medical staff to pay attention to demographics and fatigue in 
leukemic patients in order to improve their QoL and help them to organize their 
activities to promote health and QoL.

United States abridged life tables, 1996.

Anderson RN.

The life tables in this report are current abridged life tables for the United 
States based on age-specific death rates in 1996. The data used to prepare these 
abridged life tables are 1996 final mortality statistics and July 1, 1996, 
population estimates. Presented are tables showing life expectancy and 
survivorship by age, race, and sex. In 1996 the overall expectation of life at 
birth was 76.1 years, an increase of 0.3 years compared with life expectancy in 
1995. Life expectancy increased from 1995 to 1996 for each of the four race-sex 
groups for which life expectancy is reported. Life expectancy increased for 
white males by 0.5 year (from 73.4 to 73.9), for black males by 0.9 year (from 
65.2 to 66.1), for white females by 0.1 year (from 79.6 to 79.7), and for black 
females by 0.3 year (from 73.9 to 74.2).

The life tables in this report are current life tables for the United States 
based on age-specific death rates in 1999. Data used to prepare these life 
tables are 1999 final mortality statistics; July 1, 1999, population estimates; 
and data from the Medicare program. Presented are complete life tables by age, 
race, and sex. In 1999 the overall expectation of life at birth was 76.7 years, 
unchanged from 1998. Life expectancy increased from 1998 to 1999 for males, but 
decreased for females. Life expectancy increased for black males by 0.2 year 
(from 67.6 to 67.8) and for white males by 0.1 year (from 74.5 to 74.6). For 
black females, life expectancy decreased from 74.8 to 74.7 years. For white 
females the decrease was from 80.0 to 79.9.

Cost-effectiveness of surgery in the management of metastatic epidural spinal 
cord compression: a systematic review.

Fehlings MG(1), Nater A, Holmer H.

Author information:
(1)*Division of Neurosurgery and Spinal Program, University of Toronto, Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada; and †Spectrum Research, Tacoma, WA.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To perform an evidence-based synthesis of the literature to examine 
the cost-effectiveness of surgery in the management of metastatic epidural 
spinal cord compression (MESCC).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Between 2.5% and 10% of patients with cancer develop 
symptomatic MESCC, which leads to significant morbidity, and a reduction in 
quality and length of life. Although surgery is being increasingly used in the 
management of MESCC, it is unclear whether this modality is cost-effective, 
given the relatively limited lifespan of these patients.
METHODS: Numerous databases were searched to identify full economic studies 
based on key questions established a priori. Only economic studies that 
evaluated and synthesized the costs and consequences (i.e., cost-minimization, 
cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, or cost-utility) were considered for 
inclusion. Two independent reviewers examined the full text of the articles 
meeting inclusion criteria to obtain the final cohort of included studies. The 
Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument was scored by 2 independent 
reviewers.
RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 38 potentially relevant citations, 2 of 
which met the inclusion criteria. One was a cost-utility study and the other was 
a cost-effectiveness study, and both used clinical data from the same randomized 
controlled trial. Both studies found surgery plus radiotherapy to be not only 
more expensive but also more effective than radiotherapy alone in the management 
of patients with MESCC.
CONCLUSION: There is evidence from 2 high-quality studies that surgery plus 
radiotherapy is costlier but clinically more effective than radiotherapy alone 
for the management of MESCC. Of note, cost-effectiveness data for the role of 
spinal stabilization in the management of oncological spinal instability are 
lacking. This is a key knowledge gap that represents an opportunity for future 
research.

INTRODUCTION: Differences in risk for death from diseases and other causes among 
racial/ethnic groups likely contributed to the limited improvement in the state 
of health in the United States in the last few decades. The objective of this 
study was to identify causes of death that are the largest contributors to 
health disparities among racial/ethnic groups.
METHODS: Using data from WONDER system, we measured the relative (age-adjusted 
mortality ratio [AAMR]) and absolute (difference in years of life lost [dYLL]) 
differences in mortality risk between the non-Hispanic white population and the 
black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander 
populations for the 25 leading causes of death.
RESULTS: Many causes contributed to disparities between non-Hispanic whites and 
blacks, led by assault (AAMR, 7.56; dYLL, 4.5 million). Malignant neoplasms were 
the second largest absolute contributor (dYLL, 3.8 million) to black-white 
disparities; we also found substantial relative and absolute differences for 
several cardiovascular diseases. Only assault, diabetes, and diseases of the 
liver contributed substantially to disparities between non-Hispanic whites and 
Hispanics (AAMR ≥ 1.65; dYLL ≥ 325,000). Many causes of death, led by assault 
(AAMR, 3.25; dYLL, 98,000), contributed to disparities between non-Hispanic 
whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives; Asian/Pacific Islanders did not have 
a higher risk than non-Hispanic whites for death from any disease.
CONCLUSION: Assault was a substantial contributor to disparities in mortality 
among non-Asian racial/ethnic minority populations. Research and intervention 
resources need to target diseases (such as diabetes and diseases of the liver) 
that affect certain racial/ethnic populations.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies evaluated short-term efficacy and safety of 
peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) of the occipital nerves for managing chronic 
migraine. We present 52-week safety and efficacy results from an open-label 
extension of a randomized, sham-controlled trial.
METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved, randomized, multicenter, 
double-blinded study, patients were implanted with a neurostimulation system, 
randomized to an active or control group for 12 weeks, and received open-label 
treatment for an additional 40 weeks. Outcomes collected included number of 
headache days, pain intensity, migraine disability assessment (MIDAS), Zung Pain 
and Distress (PAD), direct patient reports of headache pain relief, quality of 
life, satisfaction and adverse events. Statistical tests assessed change from 
baseline to 52 weeks using paired t-tests. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses of all 
patients (N = 157) and analyses of only patients who met criteria for 
intractable chronic migraine (ICM; N = 125) were performed.
RESULTS: Headache days were significantly reduced by 6.7 (±8.4) days in the ITT 
population (p < 0.001) and by 7.7 (±8.7) days in the ICM population (p < 0.001). 
The percentages of patients who achieved a 30% and 50% reduction in headache 
days and/or pain intensity were 59.5% and 47.8%, respectively. MIDAS and Zung 
PAD scores were significantly reduced for both populations. Excellent or good 
headache relief was reported by 65.4% of the ITT population and 67.9% of the ICM 
population. More than half the patients in both cohorts were satisfied with the 
headache relief provided by the device. A total of 183 device/procedure-related 
adverse events occurred during the study, of which 18 (8.6%) required 
hospitalization and 85 (40.7%) required surgical intervention; 70% of patients 
experienced an adverse event.
CONCLUSION: Our results support the 12-month efficacy of PNS of the occipital 
nerves for headache pain and disability associated with chronic migraine. More 
emphasis on adverse event mitigation is needed in future research.

Given that life expectancy has increased considerably due to medical and 
technological advances, in recent years researchers have decided to meet the 
specific needs of the elderly in order to provide them better health care, in 
view of the fact that the aging process generates physical, biological and 
social changes. On the basis of this knowledge it becomes evident the impact of 
general health and oral health quality of life, which usually has a negative 
impact. Consequently, the aim of this work is to provide researchers and 
clinicians a review of the instruments that have been used for evaluation of the 
quality of life related to oral health. These instruments are the Oral Health 
Impact Profile (OHIP), the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) and the 
General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Supplementary to the explanation 
of these instruments, our aim is to describe their structure, assessment, 
validation and application in studies performed on elderly Mexicans. In addition 
to this, we review some of the reports that compare the usefulness of those 
instruments.

Publisher: Dado que ha habido un aumento en la expectativa de vida gracias a los 
avances médicos y tecnológicos, desde hace ya algunos años los investigadores se 
han propuesto conocer las necesidades de los adultos mayores con el fin de 
ofrecerles una mejor atención en salud, puesto que el proceso de envejecimiento 
genera cambios físicos, biológicos y sociales. A partir de este conocimiento se 
hace evidente la repercusión del estado de salud general y oral en la calidad de 
vida, lo cual tiene un impacto que, por lo general, es negativo. Por lo tanto, 
el objetivo de este trabajo es brindar tanto a investigadores como a clínicos 
una revisión de los instrumentos que han sido más utilizados para la evaluación 
de la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud oral (el Oral Health Impact 
Profile [OHIP], el Oral Impacts on Daily Performances [OIDP] y el General Oral 
Health Assessment Index [GOHAI]), su estructura, evaluación, validación y 
aplicación en investigaciones llevadas a cabo en adultos mayores mexicanos. 
Asimismo, se revisan muchos de los reportes en los que se compara la utilidad de 
los instrumentos mencionados.

BACKGROUND: The liberalisation of trade in services which began in 1995 under 
the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade 
Organisation (WTO) has generated arguments for and against its potential health 
effects. Our goal was to explore the relationship between the liberalisation of 
services under the GATS and three health indicators--life expectancy (LE), 
under-5 mortality (U5M) and maternal mortality (MM)--since the WTO was 
established.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a cross-sectional ecological study that explored 
the association in 2010 and 1995 between liberalisation and health (LE, U5M and 
MM), and between liberalisation and progress in health in the period 1995-2010, 
considering variables related to economic and social policies such as per capita 
income (GDP pc), public expenditure on health (PEH), and income inequality (Gini 
index). The units of observation and analysis were WTO member countries with 
data available for 2010 (n = 116), 1995 (n = 114) and 1995-2010 (n = 114). We 
conducted bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for GDP 
pc, Gini and PEH. Increased global liberalisation in services under the WTO was 
associated with better health in 2010 (U5M: -0.358 p<0.001; MM: -0.338 
p = 0.001; LE: 0.247 p = 0.008) and in 1995, after adjusting for economic and 
social policy variables. For the period 1995-2010, progress in health was 
associated with income equality, PEH and per capita income. No association was 
found with global liberalisation in services.
CONCLUSIONS: The favourable association in 2010 between health and 
liberalisation in services under the WTO seems to reflect a pre-WTO association 
observed in the 1995 data. However, this liberalisation did not appear as a 
factor associated with progress in health during 1995-2010. Income equality, 
health expenditure and per capita income were more powerful determinants of the 
health of populations.

I walk the line: how to tell MDS from other bone marrow failure conditions.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders 
characterized by peripheral cytopenias and ineffective hematopoiesis. MDS is an 
example of an age-related malignancy and its increasing prevalence and incidence 
can be attributed to a greater life expectancy in developed countries. Although 
frequently encountered in hematology/oncology clinics, MDS may constitute a 
diagnostic challenge especially with equivocal bone marrow morphology. Certain 
syndromes of bone marrow failure (BMF) may mimic MDS and formulating a correct 
diagnosis is vital for adequate prognostication as well as therapeutic 
approaches. Metaphase karyotyping (MK) is a very important diagnostic tool and 
marker of prognosis and can be an indicator of response to certain therapies. 
Unfortunately, chromosomal abnormalities may only be found in approximately 50 % 
of patients with MDS. In this review, we discuss the diagnostic approaches to 
patients with pancytopenia with a particular focus on the growing number of 
somatic mutations through new molecular testing.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of continuous 
and discontinuous regimens of bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (Lucentis) 
for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) from a UK National 
Health Service (NHS) perspective.
DESIGN: A within-trial cost-utility analysis with a 2-year time horizon, based 
on a multicentre factorial, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: 23 hospital ophthalmology clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: 610 patients aged ≥50 years with untreated nAMD in the study eye.
INTERVENTIONS: 0.5 mg ranibizumab or 1.25 mg bevacizumab given continuously 
(monthly) or discontinuously (as-needed) for 2 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Total 2-year costs ranged from £3002/patient ($4700; 95% CI £2601 to 
£3403) for discontinuous bevacizumab to £18 590/patient ($29 106; 95% CI £18 258 
to £18 922) for continuous ranibizumab. Ranibizumab was significantly more 
costly than bevacizumab for both continuous (+£14 989/patient ($23 468); 95% CI 
£14 522 to £15 456; p<0.001) and discontinuous treatment (+£8498 ($13 305); 95% 
CI £7700 to £9295; p<0.001), with negligible difference in QALYs. Continuous 
ranibizumab would only be cost-effective compared with continuous bevacizumab if 
the NHS were willing to pay £3.5 million ($5.5 million) per additional QALY 
gained. Patients receiving continuous bevacizumab accrued higher total costs 
(+£599 ($938); 95% CI £91 to £1107; p=0.021) than those receiving discontinuous 
bevacizumab, but also accrued non-significantly more QALYs (+0.020; 95% CI 
-0.032 to 0.071; p=0.452). Continuous bevacizumab therefore cost £30 220 
($47 316) per QALY gained versus discontinuous bevacizumab. However, 
bootstrapping demonstrated that if the NHS is willing to pay £20 000/QALY 
gained, there is a 37% chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective 
versus discontinuous bevacizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab is not cost-effective compared with bevacizumab, being 
substantially more costly and producing little or no QALY gain. Discontinuous 
bevacizumab is likely to be the most cost-effective of the four treatment 
strategies evaluated in this UK trial, although there is a 37% chance that 
continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: Discussing end-of-life (EOL) care is challenging when death is not 
imminent, contributing to poor decision-making and EOL quality-of-life. A 
communication support program (CSP) targeting these issues may facilitate 
discussions. We aimed to qualitatively explore responses to a nurse-led CSP, 
incorporating a question prompt list (QPL-booklet of questions 
patients/caregivers can ask clinicians), promoting life expectancy and EOL-care 
discussions.
METHODS: Participants met a nurse-facilitator to explore an EOL-focussed QPL. 
Prognosis and advance care planning (ACP) QPL content was highlighted. 
Thirty-one transcribed meetings were analysed using thematic text analysis 
before reaching data saturation.
RESULTS: Thirty-one advanced cancer patients (life expectancy <12 months) and 11 
family caregivers were recruited from six medical oncology clinics in Sydney, 
Australia. Intent to use the QPL related to information needs, involvement in 
care and readiness to discuss EOL issues. Many participants did not want life 
expectancy estimates, citing unreliable estimates, unknown treatment outcomes, 
or coping by not looking ahead. Most displayed interest in ACP, often motivated 
by a loved one's EOL experiences, clear treatment preferences, concerns about 
caregivers or recognition that ACP is valuable regardless of life expectancy. 
Timing emerged as a reason not to discuss EOL issues; many maintaining it was 
too early.
CONCLUSION: Patients and caregivers appear ambivalent about acknowledging 
approaching death by discussing life expectancy but value ACP. Given 
heterogeneity in responses, individualised approaches are required to guide EOL 
discussion conduct and content. Further exploration of the role of prognostic 
discussion in ACP is warranted.

Diagnostic tools for bivariate accelerated life regression models.

We propose graphical diagnostic tools to assess the fit of a bivariate 
accelerated lifetime regression model. Using univariate residuals for each 
response measurement in a pair, we assess their dependence structure via the 
bivariate probability integral transformation of univariate residuals, which we 
call V-residuals. To reduce the computational burden associated with plots of 
V-residuals, as well as some uncertainty associated with parameter estimation, 
we next develop K-residuals. We also devise adjusted V- and K-residuals to 
account for right censoring of any response. Via simulation studies, we examine 
the statistical behaviour of Q-Q plots of the estimated K-residuals, and 
demonstrate the potential of these plots to identify an appropriate choice of 
frailty distribution in bivariate modeling. We apply our proposed diagnostic 
tools to the Diabetic Retinopathy Study and assess the goodness of fit of 
various models fitted to these study data using different choices of frailty 
distributions combined with several baseline survivor functions.

Current therapies for cancer have improved life expectancy of patients. Breast 
cancer and lymphoma survivors in up to 26% of cases can develop complications as 
a consequence of the chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic treatments. 
Echocardiography is a noninvasive method that can in all stages of cancer 
treatment perform a comprehensive evaluation and detect coronary, myocardial, 
valve and pericardial disease complications secondary to the therapeutic regimen 
used (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Three-dimensional echocardiography 
derived left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has an excellent correlation 
with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and can be used to monitor LVEF; 
2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) derived strain and 
strain rate can detect changes in myocardial mechanics before changes in LVEF 
occur and can predict a future decrease in ejection fraction to less than 50% or 
of greater than 10% indicative of cardiotoxicity. Echocardiography should be 
used as the method of choice to evaluate serial changes in heart function, 
detect late side effects of treatment, and to identify patients at risk of a 
future decrease in LVEF.

BACKGROUND: Recognising colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with Lynch syndrome 
(LS) can increase life expectancy of these patients and their close relatives. 
To improve identification of this under-diagnosed disease, experts suggested 
raising the age limit for CRC tumour genetic testing from 50 to 70 years. The 
present study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this strategy.
METHODS: Probabilistic efficacy and cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out 
comparing tumour genetic testing of CRC diagnosed at age 70 or below 
(experimental strategy) versus CRC diagnosed at age 50 or below (current 
practice). The proportions of LS patients identified and cost-effectiveness 
including cascade screening of relatives, were calculated by decision analytic 
models based on real-life data.
RESULTS: Using the experimental strategy, four times more LS patients can be 
identified among CRC patients when compared with current practice. Both the 
costs to detect one LS patient (€9437/carrier versus €4837/carrier), and the 
number needed to test for detecting one LS patient (42 versus 19) doubled. When 
family cascade screening was included, the experimental strategy was found to be 
highly cost-effective according to Dutch standards, resulting in an overall 
ratio of €2703 per extra life-year gained in additionally tested patients.
CONCLUSION: Testing all CRC tumours diagnosed at or below age 70 for LS is 
cost-effective. Implementation is important as relatives from the large number 
of LS patients that are missed by current practice, can benefit from life-saving 
surveillance.

INTRODUCTION: Single modality radiosurgery (RS) is an established treatment 
option for patients with brain metastases (BM) with the aim of achieving optimal 
local control while avoiding toxicity from whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). 
Published studies generally lack detailed data on distant brain recurrence (DBR) 
rates and characteristics. This study describes the patterns of DBR and 
consequences for salvage treatment in a group of patients treated with RS alone 
for 1-3 BM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2012, 443 patients were treated with RS 
alone in doses ranging 15-24 Gy in 1-3 fractions. Patient selection for RS was 
performed using triple dose gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans, obtained with slice 
distance of 2mm (until 2008), 1.5 mm (2008-2012), and of 1 mm (from 2012). 
During follow-up, a DBR was observed in 147 patients, but in 20 of these 
patients (14%) these "new lesions" could retrospectively be seen on the planning 
MRI scan. These missed metastases had a median size of 2mm, and in order to 
study real DBR patterns, these patients were excluded from analysis.
RESULTS: Actuarial DBR rates at 6, 12 and 24 months in the remaining 423 
patients were 21%, 41% and 54%, respectively, with a median time to DBR of 5.6 
months. In 42% of DBR, a single new lesion was seen, in 70% there were ⩽3 new 
lesions. Median diameter of the DBR was 6mm; 97% of lesions were ⩽30 mm. Salvage 
therapy was delivered in 82% of DBR patients, consisting of WBRT (46%), repeated 
RS (27%), or systemic treatment (9%). A RPA classification system (DBR-RPA), 
based on WHO performance status and interval between initial RS and diagnosis of 
DBR, was developed to estimate life expectancy after the development of DBR, 
which can be used to guide salvage therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients treated with RS alone, only 25% of 
treated patients needed salvage treatment for DBR, and ultimately only 18% of 
all patients underwent WBRT at any time during follow-up. A three-monthly MRI 
follow-up scheme identifies DBR at an early stage with respect to size and 
number of lesions, and most patients were asymptomatic at radiological 
diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Although running is a popular leisure-time physical activity, little 
is known about the long-term effects of running on mortality. The dose-response 
relations between running, as well as the change in running behaviors over time, 
and mortality remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the associations of running with all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality risks in 55,137 adults, 18 to 100 years of age (mean 
age 44 years).
METHODS: Running was assessed on a medical history questionnaire by leisure-time 
activity.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 15 years, 3,413 all-cause and 1,217 
cardiovascular deaths occurred. Approximately 24% of adults participated in 
running in this population. Compared with nonrunners, runners had 30% and 45% 
lower adjusted risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively, 
with a 3-year life expectancy benefit. In dose-response analyses, the mortality 
benefits in runners were similar across quintiles of running time, distance, 
frequency, amount, and speed, compared with nonrunners. Weekly running even <51 
min, <6 miles, 1 to 2 times, <506 metabolic equivalent-minutes, or <6 miles/h 
was sufficient to reduce risk of mortality, compared with not running. In the 
analyses of change in running behaviors and mortality, persistent runners had 
the most significant benefits, with 29% and 50% lower risks of all-cause and
