recurrences (p = 0.01), and 55 (14.9%) versus 50 (12.9%) deaths without 
bacteriological failure/recurrence (p = 0.30) in the rifampicin and placebo 
groups, respectively. Over 12 weeks, there was no evidence of differences in 
clinically defined failure/recurrence/death (p = 0.84), all-cause mortality 
(p = 0.60), serious (p = 0.17) or grade 3/4 (p = 0.36) adverse events (AEs). 
However, 63 (17.0%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 39 (10.1%) 
participants in the placebo group experienced antibiotic or trial drug-modifying 
AEs (p = 0.004), and 24 (6.5%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 6 
(1.5%) participants in the placebo group experienced drug-interactions 
(p = 0.0005). Evaluation of the costs and health-related quality-of-life impacts 
revealed that an episode of S. aureus bacteraemia costs an average of £12,197 
over 12 weeks. Rifampicin was estimated to save 10% of episode costs (p = 0.14). 
After adjustment, the effect of rifampicin on total quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) was positive (0.004 QALYs), but not statistically significant (standard 
error 0.004 QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard 
antibiotic therapy in adults with S. aureus bacteraemia.
FUTURE WORK: Given the substantial mortality, other antibiotic combinations or 
improved source management should be investigated.

The answer to the question of whether endovascular techniques extend the 
barriers to treatment in multimorbid vascular patients depends on the 
localization of the vascular disease and its stage. In multimorbid vascular 
patients with limited life expectancy and asymptomatic carotid stenosis, neither 
an endovascular nor an open procedure is indicated but a conservative best 
medicinal treatment is to be preferred. In symptomatic carotid stenosis the 
endovascular procedure is indicated for special anatomical conditions, such as 
contralateral carotid artery occlusion, contralateral recurrent nerve palsy, 
recurrent stenosis following endarterectomy, radical neck dissection and 
radiotherapy in the cervical region. In the treatment of intact abdominal aortic 
aneurysms (AAA), endovascular procedures reduce the perioperative risk 
especially in older patients, allowing the indications for intervention in this 
group of patients to be expanded, provided that the life expectancy of such 
treated patients is still several years. There is no clear evidence as to 
whether endovascular repair should be preferred in ruptured AAAs but there are 
indications that with the establishment of EVAR the proportion of patients 
receiving treatment has increased in those patients who were previously denied 
surgery after arrival in hospital. In critical limb ischemia the propagation of 
endovascular techniques has not so much extended the indications for invasive 
therapy but instead the endovascular approach has superseded open bypass 
surgery, which is positively reflected in a lower perioperative morbidity, 
especially in older frail patients.

Economic evaluations are increasingly used to assess the value of health 
interventions, but variable quality and heterogeneity limit the use of these 
evaluations by decision-makers. These recommendations provide guidance for the 
design, conduct, and reporting of economic evaluations in osteoporosis to 
improve their transparency, comparability, and methodologic standards.
INTRODUCTION: This paper aims to provide recommendations for the conduct of 
economic evaluations in osteoporosis in order to improve their transparency, 
comparability, and methodologic standards.
METHODS: A working group was convened by the European Society for Clinical and 
Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis to make recommendations for 
the design, conduct, and reporting of economic evaluations in osteoporosis, to 
define an osteoporosis-specific reference case to serve a minimum standard for 
all economic analyses in osteoporosis, to discuss methodologic challenges and 
initiate a call for research. A literature review, a face-to-face meeting in New 
York City (including 11 experts), and a review/approval by a larger group of 
experts worldwide (including 23 experts in total) were conducted.
RESULTS: Recommendations on the type of economic evaluation, methods for 
economic evaluation, modeling aspects, base-case analysis and population, excess 
mortality, fracture costs and disutility, treatment characteristics, and model 
validation were provided. Recommendations for reporting economic evaluations in 
osteoporosis were also made and an osteoporosis-specific checklist was designed 
that includes items to report when performing an economic evaluation in 
osteoporosis. Further, 12 minimum criteria for economic evaluations in 
osteoporosis were identified and 12 methodologic challenges and need for further 
research were discussed.
CONCLUSION: While the working group acknowledges challenges and the need for 
further research, these recommendations are intended to supplement general and 
national guidelines for economic evaluations, improve transparency, quality, and 
comparability of economic evaluations in osteoporosis, and maintain methodologic 
standards to increase their use by decision-makers.

INTRODUCTION: Radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy 
(SFRT) is increasing in the treatment of brain metastases (BMs). Aim of the 
present study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SRS/SFRT for BMs, 
using a new mono-isocenter non-coplanar solution (HyperArc™ Varian Medical 
System).
METHODS: BMs patients with a diameter inferior to 3 cm, a life expectancy of 
more than 3 months and a good performance status, were eligible for Linac-based 
volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) SFRT/SRS with HyperArc™. A retrospective 
analysis of patients and BMs was performed.
RESULTS: From August 2017 to May 2018, 381 BMs in 64 patients were treated and 
246 BMs (43 patients, median number of BMs: 5) of them were suitable for 
analysis. With a median FU time of 6 months, 244 out 246 (99%) BMs were 
controlled (18% complete response; 41% partial response, 40% stable disease), 
2 BMs showed a progression, at the first control. No acute or late toxicities 
were reported. Median overall survival (OS) has not yet been achieved, while 
median time to progression was 5 months. In univariate analysis, statistically 
negative prognostic factors for OS were histology of primary tumor (p = 0.009): 
lung/breast cancer had better survival rates as compared to others. Cumulative 
intracranial volume disease ≥ 15 cc and systemic progression disease were 
independent prognostic factors for OS at univariate (p = 0.04; p = 0.005) and 
multivariate (p = 0.04; p = 0.009) analysis, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The present first clinical data show that SFRT/SRS with HyperArc™ is 
safe and effective for BMs patients. The utilization of SFRT/SRS for BMs is 
promising and should be further explored in randomized trials.

Chronic conditions place a high cost burden on the healthcare system and deplete 
the quality of life for millions of Americans. Digital innovations such as 
mobile health (mHealth) technology can be used to provide efficient and 
effective healthcare. In this research we explore the use of mobile technology 
to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. There is ample 
empirical evidence in the healthcare literature showing that patients who use 
mHealth observe improvement in their health. However, an analytical study that 
quantifies the benefit of using mHealth is lacking. The benefit of using mHealth 
depends on many factors such as the current health condition of the patient, 
pattern of disease progression, frequency of measurement and intervention, the 
effectiveness of intervention, and the cost of measuring. Stochastic modeling is 
a suitable approach to take these factors into consideration to evaluate the 
benefit of mHealth. In this paper, we model the disease progression with the 
help of a Markov chain and quantify the benefits of measuring and intervention 
taking into consideration the above-mentioned factors. We compare two different 
modes for measuring and intervention, mHealth mode and conventional office visit 
mode, and evaluate the impact of these factors on health outcome.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 
midostaurin + cytarabine + daunorubicin (midostaurin arm) versus 
placebo + cytarabine + daunorubicin (placebo arm) in the treatment of adult 
patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are 
eligible for standard cytarabine + daunorubicin chemotherapy, from a US 
third-party payer perspective.
METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model with four health states (active 
disease, complete remission [CR], relapse, and death) was constructed. Efficacy 
inputs (time to CR or death, time to relapse or death, and overall survival) 
were estimated using data from the RATIFY trial (NCT00651261). Costs (inflated 
to 2016 US dollars) included treatment, drug monitoring, stem cell 
transplantation (SCT), adverse events costs, and medical costs associated with 
health states. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
life-year (LY) gained were estimated. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (and PSA) were performed to assess model robustness.
RESULTS: In the base case, patients in the midostaurin arm incurred higher total 
direct costs over a lifetime compared with the placebo arm ($4,043,470 vs. 
$3,959,741), resulting in an incremental cost of $83,729; however, the 
midostaurin arm had better effectiveness, with 1.59 more LYs and 1.37 more 
QALYs. These led to a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$52,596 per LY, or $61,167 per QALY. Results were robust in the DSA. In the PSA, 
the probability of the midostaurin arm being cost-effective compared with the 
placebo arm was 65.9%, at a willingness to pay of $150,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that midostaurin is a cost-effective 
treatment for adult patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML, from a US 
third-party payer perspective.

In July 2015, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published a 
manuscript titled, "Failing to Focus on Healthy Aging: A Frailty of Our 
Discipline?" In response, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Clinical 
Practice and Models of Care Committee and Public Education Committee developed a 
white paper calling on the AGS and its members to play a more active role in 
promoting healthy aging. The executive summary presented here summarizes the 
recommendations from that white paper. The full version is published online at 
GeriatricsCareOnline.org. Life expectancy has increased dramatically over the 
last century. Longer life provides opportunity for personal fulfillment and 
contributions to community but is often associated with illness, discomfort, 
disability, and dependency at the end of life. Geriatrics has focused on 
optimizing function and quality of life as we age and reducing morbidity and 
frailty, but there is evidence of earlier onset of chronic disease that is 
likely to affect the health of future generations of older adults. The AGS is 
committed to promoting the health, independence, and engagement of all older 
adults as they age. Geriatrics as an interprofessional specialty is well 
positioned to promote healthy aging. We draw from decades of accumulated 
knowledge, skills, and experience in areas that are central to geriatric 
medicine, including expertise in complexity and the biopsychosocial model; 
attention to function and quality of life; the ability to provide culturally 
competent, person-centered care; the ability to assess people's preferences and 
values; and understanding the importance of systems in optimizing outcomes. J Am 
Geriatr Soc 67:17-20, 2019.

Adventure and excitement have often been invoked to explain why people engage in 
political violence, yet empirical evidence on the topic has thus far been 
anecdotal. The present research sought to fill this gap in knowledge by 
examining the role of sensation seeking in political violence and integrating 
this concept with Significance Quest Theory (Kruglanski, Chen, Dechesne, 
Fishman, & Orehek, 2009; Kruglanski et al., 2013). Extending prior research on 
violent extremism, Study 1 found that sensation seeking mediated the relation 
between meaning in life and willingness to self-sacrifice and support for 
political violence. Study 2 established temporal precedence of the variables in 
the mediation model, using a longitudinal design. Studies 3 and 4 experimentally 
replicated findings of Studies 1 and 2. In Studies 5a and 5b, we found that 
sensation seeking predicts support for a real life violent activist group. In 
Studies 6a and 6b, the positive evaluation of a violent activist group by 
individuals high in sensation seeking was explained by how exciting they 
perceived the group to be. Finally, Study 7 introduced an intervention targeting 
the sensation seeking motive by presenting participants with a peaceful (less 
exciting vs. exciting) activism group. As hypothesized, providing individuals 
high in sensation seeking with a peaceful yet exciting group mitigated their 
support for extreme behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights

According to regulatory focus theory, individuals generally regulate movements 
towards goals differently-using either a promotion- or a prevention-focused 
strategy. Recent research has found a close connection between regulatory focus 
and performance expectation. The current study explored their role on creative 
decision making. In an experimental setting, regulatory focus and expectation 
were manipulated and brief video clips of real football games were interrupted 
at a critical moment when the player with the ball faced a couple of possible 
actions. Experienced football players were asked to generate options to continue 
the game situations. The players' creativity was measured by performance indices 
for fluency, flexibility, and originality. Results revealed a benefit for 
players with an induced situational promotion focus as well as negative 
expectations to their performances on the generation of creative solutions. The 
findings might have implications for different complex real-life situations in 
which creativity is attributed to a performance-determining role.

Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are a major contributor to the global burden of 
disease, and have huge societal impact. Some studies show that AUD patients 
carrying the G-allele of the OPRM1 variant c.118A>G respond better to 
naltrexone, resulting in reduced relapse rates compared to carriers of the AA 
genotype. Genotype-guided treatment allocation of these patients carrying a 
G-allele to naltrexone could potentially improve the treatment outcome. However, 
cost-effectiveness of this strategy should be investigated before considering 
clinical implementation. We, therefore, evaluated costs and Quality-Adjusted 
Life-Years (QALYs), using a modelling approach, from an European perspective, of 
genotype-guided treatment allocation (G-allele carriers receiving naltrexone; AA 
homozygotes acamprosate or naltrexone) compared to standard care (random 
treatment allocation to acamprosate or naltrexone), by using a Markov model. 
Genotype-guided treatment allocation resulted in incremental costs of EUR 66 
(95% CI -28 to 149) and incremental effects of 0.005 QALYs (95% CI 0.000-0.011) 
per patient (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 13,350 per QALY). 
Sensitivity analyses showed that the risk ratio to relapse after treatment 
allocation had the largest impact on the cost-effectiveness. Depending on the 
willingness to pay for a gain of one QALY, probabilities that the intervention 
is cost-effective varies between 6 and 79%. In conclusion, pharmacogenetic 
treatment allocation of AUD patients to naltrexone, based on OPRM1 genotype, can 
be a cost-effective strategy, and could have potential individual and societal 
benefits. However, more evidence on the impact of genotype-guided treatment 
allocation on relapse is needed to substantiate these conclusions, as there is 
contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of OPRM1 genotyping.

Background: Human-capital based lifetime productivity estimates are frequently 
used in cost-of-illness (COI) analyses and, less commonly, in cost-effectiveness 
analyses (CEAs). Previous US estimates assumed that labor productivity and real 
earnings both grow by 1% per year. Objectives: This study presents estimates of 
annual and lifetime productivity for 2016 using data from the American Community 
Survey, the American Time Use Survey, and the Current Population Survey, and 
with varying assumptions about real earnings growth. Methods: The sum of market 
productivity (gross annual personal labor earnings adjusted for employer-paid 
benefits) and the imputed value of non-market time spent in household, caring, 
and volunteer services was estimated. The present value of lifetime productivity 
at various ages was calculated for synthetic cohorts using annual productivity 
estimates, life tables, discount rates, and assumptions about future earnings 
growth rates. Results: Mean annual productivity was $57,324 for US adults in 
2016, including $36,935 in market and $20,389 in non-market productivity. 
Lifetime productivity at birth, using a 3% discount rate, is roughly $1.5 
million if earnings grow by 1% per year and $1.2 million if future earnings 
growth averages 0.5% per year. Conclusions: Inclusion of avoidable productivity 
losses in societal-perspective CEAs of health interventions is recommended in 
new US cost-effectiveness guidelines. However, estimates vary depending on 
whether analysts choose to estimate total productivity or just market 
productivity, and on assumptions made about growth in future productivity and 
earnings.

BACKGROUND: The number of notified cases of Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) in 
Sweden has been increasing the past years despite the increased use of 
TBE-vaccine not subsidized by the healthcare system. Stockholm County is a high 
endemic area and an earlier study has shown that low-income households have 
lower vaccination coverage even when they are at high risk. This paper aims to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of a publicly funded TBE vaccination program in 
Stockholm.
METHODS: In three different cohorts with individuals aged 3, 40 or 50 years, 
long-term costs and health outcomes of an out-of-pocket strategy (53% of the 
cohort is vaccinated on their own expenses) and a structured vaccination program 
(full cohort is vaccinated covered by the publicly funded health care system), 
were estimated using a Markov model. The Markov model predicts the costs and 
effects in term of Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) over a lifetime horizon 
using a third-party healthcare payer perspective. The primary results are 
presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the 
additional cost required to achieve one additional QALY with the structured 
vaccination program.
RESULTS: The results show that the structured vaccination program is associated 
with a gain in QALYs and increased costs compared with an out-of-pocket 
strategy. The calculated ICERs were 27 761, 99 527 and 160 827 SEK/QALY in 
cohorts of age 3, 40 and 50, respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed that 
the results are robust when varying different parameters.
CONCLUSION: Given the setting of Stockholm county, this analysis shows a cost 
per QALY of a free vaccinations program, especially for children of 3 years old, 
below generally acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds in Sweden.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Barrett's esophagus (BE) screening is currently not 
considered to be cost effective in the general population but may be effective 
in high-risk subgroups, such as 50-year-old white men with chronic reflux 
disease (GERD). A new modality for screening is unsedated transnasal endoscopy 
using endosheath technology (uTNE), which has been shown to be safe and 
effective in clinical practice. In this study, we determined the cost-utility of 
uTNE in a high-risk subgroup compared with no screening or screening with 
standard endoscopy.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate screening of 50-year-old white men 
with symptoms of GERD with either uTNE or standard endoscopy compared with no 
screening, over a lifetime horizon. Input variables were based on the literature 
and recent data on uTNE screening for BE. The study was designed from a 
healthcare payer perspective by using direct costs. Primary outcome measures 
were costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental 
cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of uTNE and standard endoscopy compared with no 
screening. Sensitivity analysis was performed for several factors, such as 
prevalence of BE.
RESULTS: Costs of uTNE, standard endoscopy, and no screening were estimated at, 
$2495, $2957, and $1436, respectively. Compared with no screening, uTNE 
screening resulted in an overall QALY increase of 0.039 (95% percentile 0.018; 
0.063) and an ICUR of $29,446 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval [CI], 
18.516-53.091), whereas standard endoscopy compared with no screening resulted 
in a QALY increase of 0.034 (95% CI, 0.015-0.056) and an ICUR of $47,563 (95% 
CI, 31,036-82,970).
CONCLUSION: Both uTNE and standard endoscopy seem to be cost-effective screening 
methods in a screening cohort of 50-year-old white men with GERD at a 
willingness-to-pay cutoff of $50,000.

In the past century, medical progress has helped increase life expectancy and 
improve health outcomes more generally. Despite this progress, psychiatric 
disorders-especially affective disorders including depressive and anxiety 
disorders-are quite common and have been linked to dysfunction in endocrine and 
immune systems. In this review, we discuss neurobiological correlates of emotion 
regulation strategies and their effects on mental and physical health. Some of 
these correlates, namely sub-regions of prefrontal cortex, also play a key 
regulatory role in autonomic, endocrine, and immunological processes. Given this 
functional overlap, we propose a novel neuro-immuno-affective framework that 
targets improving emotion regulation, in order to: (1) reduce negative affect 
associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders; and (2) alter endocrine and 
immune system functioning (e.g., reduce inflammation)-via changes in activity 
within (and connectivity between) brain systems that support (successful) 
emotion regulation. We conclude by arguing that such a framework can be adapted 
for psychiatric treatment protocols that holistically incorporate neural and 
immunological biomarkers to promote mental and physical health.

When males outlive females: Sex-specific effects of temperature on lifespan in a 
cyclic parthenogen.

Lifespans of males and females frequently differ as a consequence of different 
life history strategies adopted to maximize fitness. It is well visible in 
cyclic parthenogens, such as water fleas of the genus Daphnia, where males 
appear in the population usually only for periods when receptive females are 
available. Moreover, even within one sex, different life history strategies and 
mechanisms regulating lifespan may exist. Previous studies suggested that 
Daphnia males may regulate their lifespan by staying in colder waters than 
females. We hypothesize that such behavioral mechanism should be associated with 
stronger reaction to low temperature-that is greater lifespan extension in males 
than in females. In this study, we monitored survivorship of Daphnia magna 
females and males of three clonal lines cultured at 16 or 20°C. The results did 
not provide a species-level corroboration of our hypothesis; instead, they 
revealed very strong intraspecific differences in the responses of male and 
female lifespan to temperature change. They further suggest the existence of 
parallel life history strategies, hypothesis whose tests would bring new 
insights into the ecology of males in cyclic parthenogens.

PURPOSE: It is unclear whether life-expectancy estimates of patients with 
advanced cancer and their caregivers are associated with patient existential, 
social, or emotional quality of life (QOL) or caregiver emotional QOL.
METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers (n = 162 dyads) 
reported estimates of the chance the patient would live for 2 years or more from 
0% (most pessimistic) to 100% (most optimistic). They also completed self-report 
measures of QOL.
RESULTS: Adjusting for sociodemographic confounds and multiple comparisons, more 
pessimistic caregiver and patient life-expectancy estimates were associated with 
worse caregiver emotional QOL and worse patient existential QOL. Discrepancies 
between patient and caregiver estimates were not associated with patient or 
caregiver QOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Pessimistic life-expectancy estimates are associated with worse 
existential QOL in patients and worse emotional QOL in caregivers. Prospective 
research to establish causal relationships is needed, and interventions to 
address the relationship between beliefs about life expectancy and existential 
and emotional QOL should be considered. Providing these interventions to 
patients and caregivers receiving information on life expectancy may mitigate 
the negative impact of life-expectancy information on patient existential 
quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 
direct-acting oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in Thai patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a HAS-BLED score of 3.
METHODS: Total costs (US$) in 2017 and quality-adjusted life-years were 
estimated over 20 years using a Markov model. A base-case analysis was conducted 
under a societal perspective, which included direct healthcare, non-healthcare 
and indirect costs in Thailand. Clinical events for warfarin and utilities were 
obtained from Thai patients whenever possible. The efficacy of direct-acting 
oral anticoagulants was derived from trial-based East Asian subgroups and 
adjusted for time in the target international normalized ratio range of 
warfarin.
RESULTS: In the base case, use of apixaban instead of warfarin incurred an 
additional cost of US$20,763 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Substituting 
apixaban with rivaroxaban and rivaroxaban with high-dose edoxaban would incur an 
additional cost per quality-adjusted life-year by US$507 and US$434, 
respectively. Compared with warfarin, high-dose edoxaban had the lowest 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$9704/quality-adjusted life-year, 
followed by high-dose dabigatran (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
US$11,155/quality-adjusted life-year). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
based on a payer perspective were similar. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was below Thailand's cost-effectiveness threshold when high-dose 
dabigatran and edoxaban prices were reduced by 50%. Changes in key parameters 
had a minimal impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
CONCLUSIONS: For both societal and payer perspectives, high-dose edoxaban with a 
price below the country cost-effectiveness threshold should be the first 
anticoagulant option for Thai patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and 
a high risk of bleeding.

Biological and Environmental Correlates of Post-Menopausal Depression Among Gopd 
Attendees in Fmc, Lokoja, Nigeria.

Rivers State, Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a chronic debilitating illness that is a component of 
the menopausal syndrome that adversely affects the quality of life of the 
sufferers and tremendously burdens their family and care givers. With the 
increase in average life expectancy, more women go through the postmenopausal 
phase for much longer and are therefore prone to the morbidity and complications 
of depressive illness associated with it. Certain biological and environmental 
factors influence the prevalence of depression among this cohort. Hence, the 
study sought to determine the biological and environmental factors influencing 
depression prevalence in postmenopausal women with a view to instituting 
prevention strategies.
METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was carried out in the 
General Outpatient Department of the Federal Medical Centre in Lokoja, 
North-Central region of Nigeria. One hundred and three postmenopausal women were 
screened for depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression 
(CES-D) questionnaire. Chi square test was used to compare the demographic 
variables with the pattern of depression with significance level set at p<0.05.
RESULTS: Prevalence of depression was 46.5%.There was no significant 
relationship between depression prevalence and age (p=0.1479), marital status 
(p=0.15208), number of years post menopause (p=0.05067), and level of education 
(p=0.100655). Severity of postmenopausal symptoms, however, was significantly 
associated with depression prevalence (p=0.01371).
CONCLUSION: Depression is highly prevalent among postmenopausal women and 
therefore there is need for effective preventive measures including routine 
screening, early detection and prompt management of depression and menopausal 
symptoms.

Current treatment for combatting Chagas disease, a life-threatening illness 
caused by the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is inadequate, 
and thus the discovery of new antiparasitic compounds is of prime importance. 
Previous studies identified the indirubins, a class of ATP kinase inhibitors, as 
potent growth inhibitors of the related kinetoplastid Leishmania. Herein, we 
evaluated the inhibitory activity of a series of 69 indirubin analogues screened 
against T. cruzi trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. Seven indirubins 
were identified as potent T. cruzi inhibitors (low μΜ, nM range). Cell death 
analysis of specific compounds [3'oxime-6-bromoindirubin(6-BIO) analogues 10, 11 
and 17, bearing a bulky extension on the oxime moiety and one 7 substituted 
analogue 32], as evaluated by electron microscopy and flow cytometry, showed a 
different mode of action between compound 32 compared to the three 6-BIO oxime- 
substituted indirubins, suggesting that indirubins may kill the parasite by 
different mechanisms dependent on their substitution. Moreover, the efficacy of 
four compounds that show the most potent anti-parasitic effect in both 
trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes (10, 11, 17, 32), was evaluated in 
a mouse model of T. cruzi infection. Compound 11 (3'piperazine-6-BIO) displayed 
the best in vivo efficacy (1/6 mortality, 94.5% blood parasitaemia reduction, 12 
dpi) at a dose five times reduced over the reference drug benznidazole (20 mg/kg 
vs100 mg/kg). We propose 3'piperazine-6-BIO as a potential lead for the 
development of new treatments of Chagas disease.

Current challenges in the treatment of HIV.

Seyler L, Lacor P, Allard SD.

In this review of the current challenges in the fight against HIV, we describe 
the state of the HIV epidemic and the framework put in place using the 90-90-90 
objectives to try and curb the epidemic worldwide. There are numerous effective 
and evidence-based prevention measures against the spread of HIV, but the 
biggest challenges lie in the lack of political commitment, reluctance to 
address issues of sexuality and reproduction, and criminalization of key 
populations that are at the highest risk of HIV. Access to HIV treatment and 
continued care without stigmatization should be as easy and cheap as possible 
for those who are tested and diagnosed with HIV to achieve the best results 
worldwide. Regarding the treatment of HIV, the last decades have been very 
successful in dramatically improving the quality of life of people living with 
HIV, reducing the transmission rate and decreasing HIV-associated morbidity and 
mortality. It could even be argued that the next milestone will be a strategy 
that allows individuals to stop combination antiretroviral therapy safely before 
a cure is discovered. Despite great progress, people with HIV have shorter life 
expectancy than those without the virus, and the underlying causes are probably
