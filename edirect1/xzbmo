protein synthesis. VWM typically presents with acute neurological decline 
following febrile infections or minor head trauma, and subsequent progressive 
neurological and cognitive regression. There is a varied clinical spectrum of 
VWM, with earlier onset associated with more severe phenotypes. Brain magnetic 
resonance imaging is usually diagnostic with diffusely abnormal white matter, 
progressing over time to cystic degeneration. We are reporting on a patient with 
infantile onset VWM associated with three heterozygous missense variants in 
EIF2B5, including a novel missense variant on exon 6 of EIF2B5 (D262N), as well 
as an interstitial duplication at 7q21.12. In addition, our case is unusual 
because of a severe epilepsy course, a novel clinical finding of hypopituitarism 
manifested by hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, and a prolonged life 
span with current age of survival of 4 years and 11 months.

BACKGROUND: deprescribing habits among physicians managing older, frailer, 
cognitively impaired patients have not been well investigated.
METHODS: an anonymised electronic survey was disseminated to all members of an 
international geriatric society/local advanced trainee network (N = 930). This 
comprised a Likert-scale analysis of factors influencing desprescribing, and 
five case vignettes, detailing a patient with progressive cognitive impairment 
and dependency, on a background of ischaemic heart disease and hypertension.
RESULTS: among 134 respondents (response rate 14.4%), 47.4% were female, 48.9% 
aged 36-50 years and 84.1% specialists (15.9% trainees). Respondents commonly 
rated limited life expectancy (96.2%) and cognitive impairment (84.1%) as 
very/extremely important to deprescribing practices. On multivariable analysis, 
older respondents less commonly rated functional dependency (odds ratio [OR] 
0.22 per change in age category; P < 0.001) and limited life expectancy (OR 
0.09, P = 0.04) important when deprescribing, while female participants (OR 
3.03, P < 0.001) and trainees (versus specialists OR 14.29, P < 0.001) more 
often rated adherence to evidence-based guidelines important. As vignettes 
described increasing dependency and cognitive impairment, physicians were more 
likely to stop donepezil, aspirin, atorvastatin and antihypertensives (all P < 
0.001 for trend). Aspirin (93.6%) and ramipril (94.1%) were most commonly 
deprescribed. Commonest reasons cited for deprescribing medications were 
'dementia severity', followed by pill burden.
CONCLUSION: in this exploratory analysis, geriatricians rated limited life 
expectancy and cognitive impairment very important in driving deprescribing 
practices. Geriatricians more often deprescribed multiple medications in the 
setting of advancing dependency and cognitive impairment, driven by dementia 
severity and pill burden concerns. Physician characteristics also influence 
deprescribing practices. Further exploration of factors influencing 
deprescribing patterns, and patient outcomes, is needed.

Efficient neuronal conductance requires that axons are insulated by glial cells. 
For this, glial membranes need to wrap around axons. Invertebrates show a 
relatively simple extension of glial membranes around the axons, resembling 
Remak fibers formed by Schwann cells in the mammalian peripheral nervous system. 
To unravel the molecular pathways underlying differentiation of glial cells that 
provide axonal wrapping, we are using the genetically amenable Drosophila model. 
At the end of larval life, the wrapping glia differentiates into very large 
cells, spanning more than 1 mm of axonal length. The extension around axonal 
membranes is not influenced by the caliber of the axon or its modality. Using 
cell type-specific gene knockdown we show that the extension of glial membranes 
around the axons is regulated by an autocrine activation of the EGF receptor 
through the neuregulin homolog Vein. This resembles the molecular mechanism 
employed during cell-autonomous reactivation of glial differentiation after 
injury in mammals. We further demonstrate that Vein, produced by the wrapping 
glia, also regulates the formation of septate junctions in the abutting 
subperineurial glia. Moreover, the wrapping glia indirectly controls the 
proliferation of the perineurial glia. Thus, the wrapping glia appears center 
stage to orchestrate the development of the different glial cell layers in a 
peripheral nerve.

INTRODUCTION: Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE 
type I) or dysfunction (C1-INH-HAE type II) is a rare disease characterized by 
recurrent episodes of edema with an estimated frequency of 1:50,000 in the 
global population without racial or gender differences. In this study we present 
the results of a nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE patients referring to 17 
Italian centers, the Italian network for C1-INH-HAE, ITACA.
METHODS: Italian patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE from 1973 to 2013 were 
included in the study. Diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE was based on family and/or 
personal history of recurrent angioedema without urticaria and on antigenic 
and/or functional C1-INH deficiency.
RESULTS: 983 patients (53% female) from 376 unrelated families were included in 
this survey. Since 1973, 63 (6%) patients diagnosed with C1-INH-HAE died and 
data from 3 patients were missing when analysis was performed. Accordingly, the 
minimum prevalence of HAE in Italy in 2013 is 920:59,394,000 inhabitants, 
equivalent to 1:64,935. Compared to the general population, patients are less 
represented in the early and late decades of life: men start reducing after the 
5(th) decade and women after the 6(th). Median age of patients is 45 (IQ 28-57), 
median age at diagnosis is 26 years (IQ 13-41). C1-INH-HAE type 1 are 87%, with 
median age at diagnosis of 25 (13-40); type 2 are 13% with median age at 
diagnosis of 31 (IQ 16-49). Functional C1INH is ≤50% in 99% of patients. Antigen 
C1INH is ≤50% in 99% of type 1. C4 is ≤50% in 96% of patients. The chance of 
having C1-INH-HAE with C4 plasma levels >50% is < 0.05.
CONCLUSION: This nationwide survey of C1-INH-HAE provides for Italy a prevalence 
of 1:64,935. C1-INH-HAE patients listed in our database have a shorter life 
expectancy than the general population. An increased awareness of the disease is 
needed to reduce this discrepancy. Measurement of C4 antigen can exclude 
diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE with an accuracy > 95%. This parameter should be 
therefore considered for initial screening in differential diagnosis of 
angioedema.

Although the life expectancy of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has 
improved in recent years, it is still far below that of the general population. 
In this retrospective study, we compared the survival of patients with ESRD 
receiving hemodialysis (HD) versus those on peritoneal dialysis (PD). The study 
was conducted on patients referred to the HD and PD centers of the Emam Khomini 
Hospital and the Aboozar Children's Hospital from January 2007 to May 2012 in 
Ahvaz, Iran. All ESRD patients on maintenance HD or PD for more than two months 
were included in the study. The survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method and the differences between HD and PD patients were tested by the 
log-rank test. Overall, 239 patients, 148 patients on HD (61.92%) and 91 
patients on continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) (38.55%) with mean age of 54.1 ± 17 
years were enrolled in the study. Regardless of the causes of ESRD and type of 
renal replacement therapy (RRT), one-, two- and three-year survival of patients 
was 65%, 51% and 35%, respectively. There was no significant difference between 
type of RRT in one- (P-value = 0.737), two- (P-value = 0.534) and three- 
(P-value = 0.867) year survival. There was also no significant difference 
between diabetic and non-diabetic patients under HD and CAPD in the one-, two- 
and three-year survival. Although the three-year survival of diabetic patients 
under CAPD was lower than that of non-diabetic patients (13% vs. 34%), it was 
not statistically significant (P-value = 0.50). According to the results of the 
current study, there is no survival advantage of PD during the first years of 
initiation of dialysis, and the one-, two- and three-year survival of HD and PD 
patients is also similar.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the economic evidence for interventions aimed at family 
carers of stroke patients.
DATA SOURCES: Searches (limited to those published in English since 1990) were 
performed in key databases along with hand searches of relevant papers.
REVIEW METHODS: Papers were restricted to studies including any economic data 
(broadly defined) for any intervention targeting carers explicitly or explicitly 
referring to a carer element, beyond involving carers in the care or 
intervention for patients (i.e. more than just carers being invited to observe 
an intervention targeted at the patient). Two reviewers independently screened 
full papers and extracted data using guidance from the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence, and quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Quality Assessment Scale (cohort studies), the Delphi list (randomised 
controlled trials) and guidelines on economic quality from the British Medical 
Journal. Data were reviewed descriptively as meta analyses were inappropriate 
due to non-comparability of studies.
RESULTS: Ten papers were included in the review. These were heterogeneous in 
their design, intervention and economic analyses making comparison difficult. 
Only three of the ten papers included economic evaluations. All three reported 
that the intervention was less costly and had better or equivalent outcomes than 
the control comparator although two of these were based on the same intervention 
using the same dataset.
CONCLUSION: There is some limited evidence that interventions for family carers 
of stroke patients are effective and cost effective. However, due to variation 
in the types of interventions examined, little can be concluded regarding 
implications for clinical practice.

[When should palliative care for children with life-threatening illnesses 
begin?].

[Article in German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

Eleonorenstiftung.

Paediatric Palliative Care in Switzerland is still in its infancy. In comparison 
to palliative care in adults, the knowledge about palliative care in children is 
limited. To facilitate the decision of when to start palliative care, an 
instrument for health professionals has been developed. The instrument, called 
Paediatric Palliative Screening Scale (PaPaS Scale), builds on five domains 
shedding light on the child's illness: 1) trajectory of disease and impact on 
daily activities; 2) treatment options and burden of treatment; 3) symptoms, 
controllability, and problem burden; 4) preferences of patient or parents; and 
5) life expectancy. The aims of a reasonably starting palliative care are 
quality of life and the ability to actively create the rest of life.

Publisher: Palliative Care bei Kindern ist in der Schweiz noch nicht weit 
entwickelt, und im Vergleich zur Palliative Care bei Erwachsenen ist das Wissen 
darüber begrenzt. Um eine palliative Begleitung sinnvoll und zeitgerecht zu 
beginnen, wurde ein Instrument entwickelt, das Fachpersonen in dieser 
schwierigen Entscheidungsfindung unterstützen soll. Das Instrument, genannt 
Paediatric Palliative Screening Scale (PaPaS Scale), basiert auf fünf Domänen, 
die die Krankheit des Kindes beleuchten: 1) Auswirkungen der Krankheit auf den 
Alltag des Kindes, 2) Therapiemöglichkeiten und Ausmass der Belastung durch die 
Therapie, 3) Symptome, deren Kontrollierbarkeit und Belastung durch die 
Symptome, 4) Wünsche des Patienten und dessen Eltern und 5) Lebenserwartung. 
Ziele einer rechtzeitig beginnenden Palliative Care sind Lebensqualität und 
Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten für die verbleibende Lebenszeit.

Publisher: Les soins palliatifs chez les enfants ne sont pas encore beaucoup 
développés en Suisse et en comparaison des soins palliatifs chez l'adulte les 
connaissances dans ce domaine sont limitées. Pour mettre en route des soins 
palliatifs de manière justifiée au bon moment, un outil a été développé pour 
aider les professionnels à prendre des décisions qui sont difficiles. Cet outil, 
connu sous l'appellation de Paediatric Palliative Screening Scale (PaPaS Scale) 
se base sur cinq domaines importants à prendre en compte chez l'enfant malade: 
1) les effets de la maladie sur le quotidien de l'enfant; 2) les possibilités 
thérapeutiques et l'importance de la charge induite par la thérapie; 3) les 
symptômes et la possibilité de les contrôler; 4) les souhaits du malade et de 
ses parents; 5) l'espérance de vie. Le but de la mise en route de soins 
palliatifs au bon moment est d'offrir la meilleure qualité de vie et condition 
de santé pour le temps qui reste à vivre.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the proportions of effective primary prevention 
interventions for non-communicable diseases with the proportions of effective 
prevention interventions delivered in practice.
METHODS: An overview of systematic reviews on prevention interventions tackling 
tobacco smoking, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, was carried out. 
Individual trials were extracted, and their results were organised by 
intervention effectiveness. Medline was searched to describe the effectiveness 
of the interventions implemented in practice.
RESULTS: We found 11 systematic reviews, 4 focusing on prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases (including 150 trials), 1 on obesity (55), and 6 on 
tobacco smoking (219). Out of all interventions, 34.9% revealed some evidence of 
effectiveness, whereas 3.6% provided evidence of adverse effects. We identified 
4 studies reporting proportions of effective prevention interventions ranging 
from 20%to 35%in the United States. A 2008 survey reported 1,501 behavioural 
prevention interventions implemented in Italy, 1% of which was evidence-based.
DISCUSSION: Only 35% of prevention interventions provided some evidence of 
effectiveness. Some interventions had harmful effects. Most of implemented 
interventions have never been evaluated. Actions are urgently needed to ensure 
that delivered interventions are effective and safe, for example by developing 
an approval system of prevention interventions.

A snapshot of cancer in Chile: analytical frameworks for developing a cancer 
policy.

INTRODUCTION: The South American country Chile now boasts a life expectancy of 
over 80 years. As a consequence, Chile now faces the increasing social and 
economic burden of cancer and must implement political policy to deliver 
equitable cancer care. Hindering the development of a national cancer policy is 
the lack of comprehensive analysis of cancer infrastructure and economic impact.
OBJECTIVES: Evaluate existing cancer policy, the extent of national 
investigation and the socio-economic impact of cancer to deliver guidelines for 
the framing of an equitable national cancer policy.
METHODS: Burden, research and care-policy systems were assessed by triangulating 
objective system metrics--epidemiological, economic, etc.--with political and 
policy analysis. Analysis of the literature and governmental databases was 
performed. The oncology community was interviewed and surveyed.
RESULTS: Chile utilizes 1% of its gross domestic product on cancer care and 
treatment. We estimate that the economic impact as measured in Disability 
Adjusted Life Years to be US$ 3.5 billion. Persistent inequalities still occur 
in cancer distribution and treatment. A high quality cancer research community 
is expanding, however, insufficient funding is directed towards 
disproportionally prevalent stomach, lung and gallbladder cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Chile has a rapidly ageing population wherein 40% smoke, 67% are 
overweight and 18% abuse alcohol, and thus the corresponding burden of cancer 
will have a negative impact on an affordable health care system. We conclude 
that the Chilean government must develop a national cancer strategy, which the 
authors outline herein and believe is essential to permit equitable cancer care 
for the country.

Endostatin is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor that exhibits potential 
anti-tumor efficacy in various preclinical animal models. However, its 
relatively short in vivo half-life and the long-term, frequent administration of 
high doses limit its widespread clinical use. In this study, we evaluated 
whether a fusion protein of murine endostatin (mEndo) to a humanized antibody 
against tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72), which is highly expressed in 
several human tumor tissues including colon cancer, can extend the serum 
half-life and improve the anti-tumor efficacy of endostatin by targeted delivery 
to the tumor mass. The fusion protein (3E8-mEndo) and mEndo showed improved 
anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo, predominantly by interfering with 
pro-angiogenic signaling triggered by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 
Moreover, in mice treated with 3E8-mEndo, we observed a markedly prolonged serum 
half-life and significantly inhibited tumor growth. The improved anti-tumor 
activity of 3E8-mEndo can be partially explained by increased local 
concentration in the tumor mass due to targeted delivery of 3E8-mEndo to 
implanted colon tumors. Collectively, our data clearly indicate that 
tumor-targeting antibody fusions to endostatin are a powerful strategy that 
improves the poor pharmacokinetic profile and anti-tumor efficacy of endostatin.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of symptoms used as a 
measure to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, type 
2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. The results of prolonged life expectancy 
and cumulative toxic effects of antiretroviral therapy increase the chance that 
HIV can cause clinical abnormalities, including MetS.
METHODS: We evaluated 89 people living with HIV (PLWH; mean age 48 ± 7 years; 
mean duration of HIV infection 17 ± 12 years; 47% men; 66% African-American, 22% 
Hispanic, and 10% non-Hispanic white; and 84% unemployed) enrolled in a 
community-based exercise training and nutrition education program targeting 
individuals of low socio-economic status (SES). The prevalence of MetS 
characteristics and the factors associated with the presence of MetS were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: One in three (33%; 12 men and 17 women) PLWH met ATPIII criteria for 
MetS. In our cohort, MetS was driven by high waist circumference and elevated 
blood pressure. In addition, higher use of protease inhibitors, elevated 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), greater self-reported daily caloric intake and 
consumption of carbohydrates, sugar, added sugar, and higher glycemic load were 
found among the individuals with MetS, compared to those without it. Elevated 
HbA1c and high total sugar consumption were the strongest predictors and 
accounted for 30% of the occurrence of MetS.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of MetS in our PLWH cohort receiving 
antiretroviral therapy is higher than previously reported in the general 
population and in other PLWH cohorts. Additional work is needed to determine 
whether MetS is a more disease dependent or lifestyle dependent condition in 
PLWH.

Increased expression of degenerative disease of the lumbar spine is an onerous 
task, which reduces the efficiency of the activity and life of many populations. 
It is the most common cause of medical visits. In 95% of cases the cause of 
complaints is a destructive process in the course of degenerative intervertebral 
disc called a lumbar disc herniation. Protrusion of the nucleus pulposus causes 
severe pain and impaired muscle tone, often more chronic and difficult to 
master. Successful treatment of lumbar disc herniation constitutes a serious 
interdisciplinary problem. It is important to properly planned and carried out 
physiotherapy. Based on the number of non-invasive methods, to reduce muscle 
tension, mute pain and alleviation of inflammation. It is the treatment safe, 
effective, and at the same time, which is their big advantage, readily available 
and cheap. It is worth noting that not every method has the same efficiency. The 
question that the methods are effective in relieving pain and helping to 
effectively increase the range of motion led to a comparison of two methods - 
Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) and pulsating magnetic field therapy.
AIM: The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of LLLT and pulsating 
magnetic field therapy in combating pain and increase range of motion of the 
spine of people with degenerative spine disease of the lower back.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 patients with diagnose lumbar disc herniation whit no 
nerve roots symptoms. Patients were divided into two Groups: A and B. Group A of 
60 patients were subjected to laser therapy (λ=820nm, P=400mW, Ed=6-12 J/cm²) 
and the second Group B of 60 patients too, to pulsating magnetic fields 
procedures (5mT, 30 Hz, 15 minutes). Every patient before rehabilitation started 
and right after it has finished has undergone examination. Subjective pain 
assessment was carried out using a modified Laitinen questionnaire and Visual 
Analogue Scale of Pain intensity. Spine mobility was evaluated whit the Schober 
test and the Fingertip-to-floor-test. The obtained results were subjects to 
statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Research shows that both low energy laser and pulsating magnetic field 
physical attributes are effective methods for the treatment of pain and 
restricted mobility of the spine caused by disc herniation. Careful analysis 
emphasizes greater efficiency laser for pain. In contrast, a statistically 
greater improvement in global mobility of the spine, as well as flexion and 
extension of the lumbar recorded in group B, where the applied pulsating 
magnetic field.
CONCLUSIONS: Both laser and magnet therapy reduces pain and improves mobility of 
the spine of people with degenerative spine disease of the lower back. 
Comparison of the effectiveness of both methods showed a greater analgesic 
effect of laser treatment, and greater mobility of the spine was observed under 
the influence of pulsating magnetic field therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a devastating, progressive disease 
with increasingly debilitating symptoms and usually shortened overall life 
expectancy due to a narrowing of the pulmonary vasculature and consecutive right 
heart failure. Little is known about PH in Africa, but limited reports suggest 
that PH is more prevalent in Africa compared with developed countries due to the 
high prevalence of risk factors in the region.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multinational multicentre registry-type cohort study was 
established and tailored to resource-constraint settings to describe disease 
presentation, disease severity and aetiologies of PH, comorbidities, diagnostic 
and therapeutic management, and the natural course of PH in Africa. PH will be 
diagnosed by specialist cardiologists using echocardiography (right ventricular 
systolic pressure >35 mm Hg, absence of pulmonary stenosis and acute right heart 
failure), usually accompanied by shortness of breath, fatigue, peripheral oedema 
and other cardiovascular symptoms, ECG and chest X-ray changes in keeping with 
PH as per guidelines (European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory 
Society (ESC/ERS) guidelines). Additional investigations such as a CT scan, a 
ventilation/perfusion scan or right heart catheterisation will be performed at 
the discretion of the treating physician. Functional tests include a 6 min walk 
test and the Karnofsky Performance Score. The WHO classification system for PH 
will be applied to describe the different aetiologies of PH. Several substudies 
have been implemented within the registry to investigate specific types of PH 
and their outcome at up to 24 months. Data will be analysed by an independent 
institution following a data analyse plan.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All local ethics committees of the participating 
centres approved the protocol. The data will be disseminated through 
peer-reviewed journals at national and international conferences and public 
events at local care providers.

[The Detections, functions and regulations of G-quadruplex].

[Article in Chinese]

Gao J, Yuan G, Xu M.

G-quadruplex structure was found recently as a special secondary structure of 
Nucleic acid. It can be formed easily and widely in vivo and has important 
biological functions. Researchers have detected the formation of G-quadruplex in 
vitro and solved its crystal structure by using specific fluorescent probes, 
antibodies, etc., which are constantly discovered or synthesized. G-quadruplex 
structures are distributed widely not only in the significantly functional 
region as telomere, promoter, gene extron, but also in the 5 'untranslated 
region (5'UTR), intron and 3'flanking region (3'UTR) of RNA. They play vital 
roles in the extension of telomeres, DNA replication, transcription, meiosis, 
recombination, and otherpivotal life processes. Additionally, they can exert 
anti-tumor, anti-virus, inhibiting angiogenesis and other important functions. 
Currently anticancer drugs based on G-quadruplex structure have entered clinical 
trials and obtained good curative effects. G-quadruplex can be regulated 
endogenously by the methylation and the interaction with many proteins and stays 
in a balanced content and morphology. Some exogenous small molecules can also 
play such regulatory roles. This paper will systematically summarize detection 
methods, special functions and regulation of G-quadruplex in the fields of 
chemistry, biology and medicine.

Macrophages provide a bridge linking innate and adaptive immunity. An increased 
frequency of macrophages and other myeloid cells paired with excessive cytokine 
production is commonly seen in the aging immune system, known as 
'inflamm-aging'. It is presently unclear how healthy macrophages are maintained 
throughout life and what connects inflammation with myeloid dysfunction during 
aging. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation mechanism, has known links with 
aging and lifespan extension. Here, we show for the first time that autophagy 
regulates the acquisition of major aging features in macrophages. In the absence 
of the essential autophagy gene Atg7, macrophage populations are increased and 
key functions such as phagocytosis and nitrite burst are reduced, while the 
inflammatory cytokine response is significantly increased - a phenotype also 
observed in aged macrophages. Furthermore, reduced autophagy decreases surface 
antigen expression and skews macrophage metabolism toward glycolysis. We show 
that macrophages from aged mice exhibit significantly reduced autophagic flux 
compared to young mice. These data demonstrate that autophagy plays a critical 
role in the maintenance of macrophage homeostasis and function, regulating 
inflammation and metabolism and thereby preventing immunosenescence. Thus, 
autophagy modulation may prevent excess inflammation and preserve macrophage 
function during aging, improving immune responses and reducing the morbidity and 
mortality associated with inflamm-aging.

A pharmacoeconomic analysis of phosphate binders cost-effectiveness in the 
RISCAVID study.

Panichi V, Rosati A, Di Giorgio A, Scatena A, Bigazzi R, Grazi G, Migliori M, 
Paoletti S, Manca Rizza G, Casani A, Sgambato A, Ruggeri M.

BACKGROUND: A pharmacoeconomic analysis of the RISCAVID database aimed at 
assessing the cost effectiveness of phosphate binders in preventing CV mortality 
and morbidity over 7 years was performed.
METHODS: Morbid or fatal events occurring in 750 chronic HD patients were 
recorded. Statistical analysis evaluated the distribution of variables and the 
effect of sevelamer on survival. A cost-effectiveness evaluation was performed 
using a probabilistic model based on a Markov chain.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with sevelamer was 
associated with a reduced stroke incidence by 52% (p = 0.04) and reduced levels 
of C-reactive protein (p < 0.01). Cost-effectiveness evaluation evidenced a 33% 
decrease in hospital-days for patients treated with sevelamer, with and without 
comorbidities compared to patients undergoing calcium binders treatment.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with sevelamer was associated with a reduced risk of 
stroke in HD patients, with a clear saving on disease-related costs for the 
Italian National Healthcare System.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that 
primarily affects motoneurons in the brain and spinal cord. Astrocyte and 
microglia activation as well as skeletal muscle atrophy are also typical 
hallmarks of the disease. However, the functional relationship between 
astrocytes, microglia and skeletal muscle in the pathogenic process remains 
unclear. Here, we report that the tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of 
apoptosis (Tweak) and its receptor Fn14 are aberrantly expressed in spinal 
astrocytes and skeletal muscle of SOD1(G93A) mice. We show that Tweak induces 
motoneuron death, stimulates astrocytic interleukin-6 release and astrocytic 
proliferation in vitro. The genetic ablation of Tweak in SOD1(G93A) mice 
significantly reduces astrocytosis, microgliosis and ameliorates skeletal muscle 
atrophy. The peripheral neutralization of Tweak through antagonistic anti-Tweak 
antibody ameliorates muscle pathology and notably, decreases microglial 
activation in SOD1(G93A) mice. Unexpectedly, none of these approaches improved 
motor function, lifespan and motoneuron survival. Our work emphasizes the 
multi-systemic aspect of ALS, and suggests that a combinatorial therapy 
targeting multiple cell types will be instrumental to halt the neurodegenerative 
process.

Breast cancer incidence increases with age, but many older women do not receive 
appropriate mammography screening. A tool to support provider decision making 
holds potential to help providers and patients reach the best-informed decisions 
possible. We developed and tested a decision aid (DA) for healthcare providers 
to use in mammography screening recommendations in older women. Literature 
review, expert opinion, focus groups, and pilot testing of the DA were conducted 
in a university ambulatory geriatrics practice. Provider evaluations of the DA 
after piloting were collected and analyzed. Geriatricians reported important 
factors in decision making included patient life-expectancy, preferences, 
cognitive function, and individualization. Geriatricians reported the DA would 
have helped them make recommendations for mammography screening in 66% of pilot 
cases. It was less helpful when there was more certainty regarding decision 
making.

Fournier's gangrene is a fearsome disease with a bad prognosis and a mortality 
rate ranging between 10 and 80% according to the literature. It is extensive in 
13 to 54% of cases. Up to date, cervico-facial extension has never been 
reported. We describe the case of a 51-year-old overweighed woman with a history 
of type 2 diabetes and a narrow lumbar canal who was referred to our institution 
for significant fatigue and increasingly painful legs. A diagnosis of Fournier's 
gangrene was made after correlating the physical findings with the results of a 
full body scan. Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema involving the face, neck, 
mediastinum, abdominal wall, right buttock, perineum and the right thigh was 
identified. Treatment included multiple surgical debridements, admission to 
intensive care unit, and an efficient antibiotic therapy that enabled 
preservation of the patient's life. To our knowledge, this is the first case of 
cervical and mediastinal extension of Fournier's gangrene to be reported. No 
clear guidelines exit on the management of this complication (cervico-facial and 
mediastinal drainage). We share our experience of this unusual case.

Since meniscal geometry affects the cartilage contact pressures, it is essential 
to carefully define the geometry of the synthetic meniscal implant that we 
developed. Recently, six independent modes of size- and shape-related geometry 
variation were identified through 3D statistical shape modeling (SSM) of the 
medial meniscus. However, this model did not provide information on the 
functional importance of these geometry characteristics. Therefore, in this 
study finite element simulations were performed to determine the influence of 
anatomically-based meniscal implant size and shape variations on knee cartilage 
contact pressures. Finite element simulations of the knee joint were performed 
for a total medial meniscectomy, an allograft, the average implant geometry, six 
implant sizes and ten shape variations. The geometries of the allograft and all 
implant variations were based on the meniscus SSM. Cartilage contact pressures 
and implant tensile strains were evaluated in full extension under 1200N of 
axial compression. The average implant induced cartilage peak pressures 
intermediate between the allograft and meniscectomy and also reduced the 
cartilage area subjected to pressures >5MPa compared to the meniscectomy. The 
smaller implant sizes resulted in lower cartilage peak pressures and compressive 
strains than the allograft, yet high implant tensile strains were observed. 
Shape modes 2, 3 and 6 affected the cartilage contact stresses but to a lesser 
extent than the size variations. Shape modes 4 and 5 did not result in changes 
of the cartilage stress levels. The present study indicates that cartilage 
contact mechanics are more sensitive to implant size than to implant shape. 
Down-sizing the implant resulted in more favorable contact mechanics, but caused 
excessive material strains. Further evaluations are necessary to balance 
cartilage contact pressures and material strains to ensure cartilage protection 
and longevity of the implant.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although colonic diverticulitis is a common disorder, there 
is no clear treatment strategy for patients with recurrent episodes of 
diverticulitis. We investigated whether colonic resection or conservative or 
medical treatments have the greatest effects on quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).
METHODS: A Markov model simulating patients with 2 episodes of non-surgically 
treated diverticulitis was used to simulate all relevant outcomes of each 
treatment strategy. A 1-year cycle length with 10-year follow-up period was used 
to allow for chance of recurrent diverticulitis. Primary outcome was QALYs 
gained from each strategy. Factors considered were morbidity, mortality, chance 
of colostomy formation, risk of recurrence, and persistence of abdominal pain. 
The probabilities of clinical events were determined by using the best available 
published data.
RESULTS: A strategy in which colonic resection was performed after 2 episodes of 
diverticulitis was associated with the lowest quality-adjusted survival (a gain 
of 8.66 QALYs) and highest chance of stoma formation (1.1%) but the lowest 
chance of a mild (3.5%) or severe (1.1%) recurrence. The strategies of colonic 
resection or conservative or medical treatment after the third episode of 
diverticulitis were comparable in terms of quality-adjusted survival, providing 
8.78, 8.76, and 8.74 QALYs, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis did 
not change these results. Persistent abdominal complaints were lowest in the 
medical treatment strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Elective surgery after 2 episodes of diverticulitis should be 
questioned in terms of QALYs. After the third episode of diverticulitis, 
surgical or conservative or medical treatments provide similar QALYs, but rates 
of abdominal symptoms are lower with the medical treatment strategy. This Markov 
decision model has limitations when the individual patient and physician face a 
complex decision weighing early and long-term risks and benefits of elective
