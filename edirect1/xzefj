BACKGROUND: Human life quality and expectancy have increased dramatically over 
the past 5 decades because of improvements in nutrition and antibiotic's usage 
fighting against infectious diseases. Yet, it was soon revealed that the 
microbes adapted to develop resistance to any of the drugs that were used. 
Recently, there is great concern that commensal bacteria from food and the 
gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals could act as a reservoir for 
antibiotic resistance genes. Methodology. This study was intended for evaluating 
the phenotypic antibiotic resistance/sensitivity profiles of probiotic bacteria 
from human breast milk and evaluating the inhibitory effect of the probiotic 
bacteria against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
RESULTS: The results point out that some of the isolated bacteria were resistant 
to diverse antibiotics including gentamycin, imipenem, trimethoprim 
sulfamethoxazole, and nalidixic acid. Susceptibility profile to certain 
antibiotics like vancomycin, tetracycline, ofloxacin, chloramphenicol, 
streptomycin, rifampicin, and bacitracin was also observed. The antimicrobial 
qualities of cell-free supernatants of some probiotic bacteria inhibited the 
growth of indicator bacteria. Also, antimicrobial properties of the probiotic 
bacteria from the present study attributed to the production of organic acid, 
bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (BATH), salt aggregation, coaggregation with 
pathogens, and bacteriocin production. Some isolated bacteria from human milk 
displayed higher hydrophobicity in addition to intrinsic probiotic properties 
like Gram-positive classification, catalase-negative activity, resistance to 
gastric juice (pH 2), and bile salt (0.3%) concentration.
CONCLUSION: This study has added to the data of the antibiotic and antimicrobial 
activity of some probiotic bacteria from some samples of Pakistani women breast 
milk. Probiotic bacteria are usually considered to decrease gastrointestinal 
tract diseases by adhering to the gut epithelial and reducing population of 
pathogens and in the case of Streptococcus lactarius MB622 and Streptococcus 
salivarius MB620 in terms of hydrophobicity and exclusion of indicator 
pathogenic strains.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrill ation (AF) is a predominant public health concern in 
older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the global, regional, and 
national burden of AF in older adults aged 60-89 between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: The morbidity, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
age-standardized rates of AF were refined from the Global Burden of Diseases 
study 2019. The epidemiological characteristics were assessed based on numerical 
values, age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years, and estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPC).
RESULTS: Globally, a total of 33.31 million AF cases, 219.4 thousand deaths, and 
65.80 million DALYs were documented in 2019. There were no appreciable changes 
in EAPC from 1990 to 2019. The disease burden of AF differed significantly 
across different territories and countries. At the national level, China 
exhibited the highest number of incident cases [818,493 (562,871-1,128,695)], 
deaths [39,970 (33,722-46,387)], and DALYs [1,383,674 (1,047,540-1,802,516)]. At 
the global level, high body mass index (BMI) and high systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) were two predominant risk factors contributing to the proportion of 
AF-related deaths.
CONCLUSION: AF in older adults remains a major public health concern worldwide. 
The burden of AF varies widely at both national and regional levels. From 1990 
to 2019, the cases of incidences, deaths, and DALYs have shown a global 
increase. The ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR have declined in the high-moderate and high 
SDI regions; however, the burden of AF increased promptly in the lower SDI 
regions. Special attention should be paid to the main risk factors for high-risk 
individuals with AF, which can help control systolic blood pressure and body 
mass index within normal limits. Over all, it is necessary to illustrate the 
features of the global AF burden and develop more effective and targeted 
prevention and treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 
has improved due to advances in medical care. DMD patients develop progressive 
spinal deformity after loss of ambulatory function and onset of wheelchair 
dependence for mobility. There is limited published data on the effect of spinal 
deformity correction on long-term functional outcomes, quality of life (QoL), 
and satisfaction in DMD patients.
AIM: To investigate the long-term functional outcomes following spinal deformity 
correction in DMD patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study from 2000-2022. Data was 
collected from hospital records and radiographs. At follow-up, patients 
completed the muscular dystrophy spine questionnaire (MDSQ). Statistical 
analysis was performed by linear regression analysis and ANOVA to analyse 
clinical and radiographic factors significantly associated with MDSQ scores.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients were included with mean age 14.4 years at surgery. 
Spino-pelvic fusion was performed in 41.9% of patients. Mean surgical time was 
352.1 min and mean blood loss was 36% of estimated total blood volume. Mean 
hospital stay was 14.1 d. Postoperative complications occurred in 25.6% of 
patients. Mean preoperative scoliosis was 58°, pelvic obliquity 16.4°, thoracic 
kyphosis 55.8°, lumbar lordosis 11.1°, coronal balance 3.8 cm, and sagittal 
balance + 6.1 cm. Mean surgical correction of scoliosis was 79.2% and of pelvic 
obliquity was 80.8%. Mean follow-up was 10.9 years (range: 2-22.5). Twenty-four 
patients had died at follow-up. Sixteen patients completed the MDSQ at mean age 
25.4 years (range 15.2-37.3). Two patients were bed-ridden and 7 were on 
ventilatory support. Mean MDSQ total score was 38.1. All 16 patients were 
satisfied with the results of spinal surgery and would choose surgery again if 
offered. Most patients (87.5%) reported no severe back pain at follow-up. 
Factors significantly associated with functional outcomes (MDSQ total score) 
included greater duration of post-operative follow-up, age, scoliosis 
postoperatively, correction of scoliosis, increased lumbar lordosis 
postoperatively, and greater age at loss of independent ambulation.
CONCLUSION: Spinal deformity correction in DMD patients leads to positive 
long-term effects on QoL and high patient satisfaction. These results support 
spinal deformity correction to improve long-term QoL in DMD patients.

Fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS) presents as various phenotypes ranging from 
asymptomatic colonization to life-threatening infections. Here, we report an 
atypical case of FRS of the left maxillary sinus that extended to the 
contralateral maxillary sinus through the nasal septum. An 80-year-old woman 
with a history of osteoporosis was referred to our hospital for further 
management of headaches and chronic rhinosinusitis. Computed tomography (CT) of 
the sinus revealed a mass lesion with calcification in the left maxillary sinus, 
extending to the contralateral maxillary sinus through the nasal septum. 
T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass lesion 
with low-intensity signals. Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed for the 
diagnosis and treatment. Histopathological examination revealed fungal elements 
in the caseous material of the left maxillary sinus. However, no tissue-invasive 
fungal forms were found. Additionally, eosinophilic mucin was not observed. 
Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with fungus ball (FB). To the 
best of our knowledge, there are no reports of a FB extending contralaterally 
through the nasal septum. This report serves as a reminder that FB can extend 
into contralateral paranasal sinuses through the nasal septum and the 
possibility that osteoporosis is a cause of extensive bone destruction.

Pancreaticobiliary obstruction is a rare but life-threatening complication. 
Plastic biliary stents are a temporary utility to maintain the patency of the 
common bile ducts, typically lasting about four months. Biliary stents can 
rarely have complications, with the most common being migration through the 
gastrointestinal tract. We present a case of a patient with a plastic stent 
placed over five years, which was complicated by severe hematochezia due to the 
retention of the stent in a diverticulum. Given the increased risk of 
life-threatening complications post-stent life expectancy, there should be 
systems in place to prevent patients from being lost to follow-up.

Individuals with limited life expectancy represent a significant proportion of 
healthcare consumers and are usually patients with multiple diseases and high 
levels of frailty. Polypharmacy and the prescription of long lists of drugs are 
frequent in patients with reduced life expectancy and often, as the patient's 
health status deteriorates, the list of drugs increases substantially as new 
medications are introduced to address new symptoms or complications. A key 
priority for healthcare professionals managing the care of these patients should 
be balancing the pharmacological approach to chronic diseases with the 
palliation of acute symptoms and complications. An important element of this 
process is to ensure that the benefit of any prescription decision outweighs 
potential risks. We reviewed the pros and cons of deprescribing drugs in 
individuals with limited life expectancy, how to identify the expected disease 
trajectory, which drugs are to be discontinued, identified some models trying to 
achieve rigorous deprescribing criteria, and the psychosocial effects of 
deprescribing in late phases of life. Deprescribing is not a one-time event but 
rather a continuous process that requires ongoing evaluation and monitoring. It 
is vital to continuously monitor and evaluate the pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological prescriptions for patients with chronic illnesses to align 
them with their goals of care and life expectancy.

Accessibility of healthy food is an important predictor for several health 
outcomes, but its association with life expectancy is unclear. We evaluated the 
association between U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Research Atlas 
measures of healthy food accessibility and life expectancy at birth across 
contiguous U.S. census tracts using spatial modeling analysis. Both income and 
healthy food accessibility were associated with life expectancy at birth, as 
indicated by shorter life expectancy in low-income census tracts when comparing 
tracts with similar healthy food accessibility level, and in low-access tracts 
when comparing tracts with similar income level. Compared to 
high-income/high-access census tracts, life expectancy at birth was lower in 
high-income/low-access (- 0.33 years; 95% confidence interval - 0.42, - 0.28), 
low-income/high-access (- 1.45 years; - 1.52, - 1.38), and low-income/low-access 
(- 2.29 years; - 2.38, - 2.21) tracts after adjusting for socio-demographic 
characteristics and incorporating vehicle availability. Effective interventions 
to increase healthy food accessibility may improve life expectancy.

IMPORTANCE: There is limited understanding of how complex evidence-based 
psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
depression work. Identifying active ingredients may help to make therapy more 
potent, brief, and scalable.
OBJECTIVE: To test the individual main effects and interactions of 7 treatment 
components within internet-delivered CBT for depression to investigate its 
active ingredients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized optimization trial using a 
32-condition, balanced, fractional factorial optimization experiment (IMPROVE-2) 
recruited adults with depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score 
≥10) from internet advertising and the UK National Health Service Improving 
Access to Psychological Therapies service. Participants were randomized from 
July 7, 2015, to March 29, 2017, with follow-up for 6 months after treatment 
until December 29, 2017. Data were analyzed from July 2018 to April 2023.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized with equal probability to 7 
experimental factors within the internet CBT platform, each reflecting the 
presence vs absence of specific treatment components (activity scheduling, 
functional analysis, thought challenging, relaxation, concreteness training, 
absorption, and self-compassion training).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was depression symptoms (PHQ-9 
score). Secondary outcomes include anxiety symptoms and work, home, and social 
functioning.
RESULTS: Among 767 participants (mean age [SD] age, 38.5 [11.62] years; range, 
18-76 years; 635 women [82.8%]), 506 (66%) completed the 6-month posttreatment 
follow-up. On average, participants receiving internet-delivered CBT had reduced 
depression (pre-to-posttreatment difference in PHQ-9 score, -7.79 [90% CI, -8.21 
to -7.37]; 6-month follow-up difference in PHQ-9 score, -8.63 [90% CI, -9.04 to 
-8.22]). A baseline score-adjusted analysis of covariance model using 
effect-coded intervention variables (-1 or +1) found no main effect on 
depression symptoms for the presence vs absence of activity scheduling, 
functional analysis, thought challenging, relaxation, concreteness training, or 
self-compassion training (posttreatment: largest difference in PHQ-9 score 
[functional analysis], -0.09 [90% CI, -0.56 to 0.39]; 6-month follow-up: largest 
difference in PHQ-9 score [relaxation], -0.18 [90% CI, -0.61 to 0.25]). Only 
absorption training had a significant main effect on depressive symptoms at 
6-month follow-up (posttreatment difference in PHQ-9 score, 0.21 [90% CI, -0.27 
to 0.68]; 6-month follow-up difference in PHQ-9 score, -0.54, [90% CI, -0.97 to 
-0.11]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized optimization trial, all components 
of internet-delivered CBT except absorption training did not significantly 
reduce depression symptoms relative to their absence despite an overall average 
reduction in symptoms. The findings suggest that treatment benefit from 
internet-delivered CBT probably accrues from spontaneous remission, factors 
common to all CBT components (eg, structure, making active plans), and 
nonspecific therapy factors (eg, positive expectancy), with the possible 
exception of absorption focused on enhancing direct contact with positive 
reinforcers.

Raw beef patties were treated with either 450 ppm of Sodium metabisulphite 
(SMB), or Kakadu plum powder (KPP) (0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%) or no additive 
(negative control) and stored under Modified Atmosphere Packaging at 4 ± 1 °C 
for 20 days. Lipid oxidation, microbial growth rate, pH, instrumental color, and 
surface myoglobin were studied. Total phenolic compounds (TPC) and vitamin C of 
the KPP were also measured. The TPC was 13.9 g GAE/ 100 g dry weight (DW) and 
for vitamin C, the L-AA (l-ascorbic acid) and DHAA (dehydroascorbic acid) were 
12.05 g/100 g and 0.5 g/ 100 g DW, respectively. The experimental results 
indicated that lipid oxidation was significantly delayed throughout the storage 
period for KPP-treated samples compared to both the negative control and 
SMB-treated samples. KPP at levels of 0.2% and 0.4% in the raw beef patties were 
efficient in slowing down the microbial growth rate compared to the negative 
control; however, SMB had a higher antimicrobial activity. The pH, the redness 
as well as metmyoglobin formation in the raw beef patties were reduced by the 
inclusion of the KPP in treated samples. A correlation (r = -0.66) was noted 
between KPP treatments and lipid oxidation, but there was no correlation 
(r = -0.006) between KPP treatment and microbial growth. This study demonstrates 
that KPP could be used as natural preservative for shelf-life extension of raw 
beef patties.

INTRODUCTION: Currently, breast cancer ranks first among female malignancies; 
hence, there are strong recommendations for the early inclusion of these 
patients in palliative care. Palliative care aims to alleviate symptoms 
improving the quality of life of dying patients, an essential component of 
breast cancer care. This study aimed to map and synthesise the available 
evidence on palliative care for women with breast cancer and to discuss the 
review results with stakeholders.
METHODS: A scoping review protocol is presented in this article, consisting of 
two phases. In the first phase, a scoping review study will be conducted 
adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines and guided 
by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis. Nine databases, an 
electronic repository, a trial register website, grey literature and additional 
sources will be searched. A focus group discussion with six stakeholders will 
occur in the second phase. The analysis will be performed through inductive and 
manifest content analysis using the IRaMuTeQ V.0.7 alpha software.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scoping review protocol did not require ethical 
approval. However, the study's second phase has been approved by the 
institutional review board of Maternidade Escola Assis Chateaubriand/MEAC/UFC. 
The findings will be disseminated through professional networks, conference 
presentations and publications.

The surgical installation accuracy of the components in unicompartmental knee 
arthroplasty (UKA) is an important factor affecting the joint function and the 
implant life. Taking the ratio of the medial-lateral position of the femoral 
component relative to the tibial insert (a/A) as a parameter, and considering 
nine installation conditions of the femoral component, this study established 
the musculoskeletal multibody dynamics models of UKA to simulate the patients' 
walking gait, and investigated the influences of the medial-lateral installation 
positions of the femoral component in UKA on the contact force, joint motion and 
ligament force of the knee joint. The results showed that, with the increase of 
a/A ratio, the medial contact force of the UKA implant was decreased and the 
lateral contact force of the cartilage was increased; the varus rotation, 
external rotation and posterior translation of the knee joint were increased; 
and the anterior cruciate ligament force, posterior cruciate ligament force and 
medial collateral ligament force were decreased. The medial-lateral installation 
positions of the femoral component in UKA had little effect on knee 
flexion-extension movement and lateral collateral ligament force. When the a/A 
ratio was less than or equalled to 0.375, the femoral component collided with 
the tibia. In order to prevent the overload on the medial implant and lateral 
cartilage, the excessive ligament force, and the collision between the femoral 
component and the tibia, it is suggested that the a/A ratio should be controlled 
within the range of 0.427-0.688 when the femoral component is installed in UKA. 
This study provides a reference for the accurate installation of the femoral 
component in UKA.

单髁膝关节置换术（UKA）中假体的手术安装精度是影响术后膝关节功能和假体寿命的重要因素。本文以UKA股骨部件相对胫骨衬垫内外侧位置的比值（a/A）为参数，分别考虑了9种不同股骨部件安装情况，建立UKA置换的骨肌多体动力学模型并模拟患者术后行走步态，研究UKA手术中股骨部件内外侧安装位置对术后膝关节接触力、关节运动和韧带力的影响。结果表明，随着a/A比值的增大，膝关节内侧假体接触力减小，外侧软骨接触力增大；膝关节内翻运动、外旋运动和关节后移运动增大；前交叉韧带力、后交叉韧带力和内侧副韧带力减小。UKA股骨部件内外侧安装位置对膝关节屈曲伸展运动、外侧副韧带力影响不大。而当a/A≤0.375时，股骨部件与胫骨会产生接触。为了避免内侧假体和外侧软骨承受过高的载荷、产生过高的韧带力以及内侧假体与胫骨碰撞等问题，本文建议医生UKA手术中安装股骨部件时a/A比值控制在0.427~0.688范围内，为UKA手术中股骨部件内外侧安装提供了参考依据。.

Objective: To calculate and compare the healthy life expectancy (HLE) of the 
middle-aged and elderly in China, the United States, and developing and 
developed countries in the European Union(EU) and analyze the impact of 
socioeconomic factors on HLE in different countries or regions. Methods: Four 
surveys from 2010 to 2019 were brought into the research. The data were 
collected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, Health and 
Retirement Study, and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. 
Developed and developing countries in the EU were divided into two groups for 
calculation. Education level, total family wealth, and work retirement status 
were selected to measure socioeconomic status, and activities of daily living 
were used as health status indicators. We used the multi-state life cycle table 
method to calculate the transition probability between different health states 
and estimate life expectancy and HLE. Results: A total of 69 544 samples were 
included in the study. In terms of age, the middle-aged and elderly in the 
United States and developed countries of the EU have higher HLE in all age 
groups. In terms of gender, only Chinese women have lower HLE than men. 
Regarding socioeconomic factors, the middle-aged and elderly with higher 
education levels and total family wealth level have higher HLE. In China, 
working seniors have higher HLE, while for USA women and developed countries of 
the EU, retired or unemployed seniors have higher HLE. Conclusions: Demographic 
and socioeconomic factors impact HLE in different countries or regions. China 
should pay more attention to the health of women and the middle-aged and elderly 
retired with lower education and less total family wealth.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies suggested that long-term exposure to 
ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with increased risk of 
stroke. However, limited studies evaluated the stroke burden attributable to 
ambient PM2.5 globally, especially comprising across different regions, 
countries, and social-economic levels. We thus conducted this study to estimate 
the spatial and temporal trends of ambient PM2.5-related stroke burden by sex, 
age, and subtypes from 1990 to 2019 at global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: Information on the ambient PM2.5-related stroke burden from 1990 to 
2019 was obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019. The burdens of 
stroke attributable to ambient PM2.5 (i.e., age-standardized mortality rate 
[ASMR] and age-standardized disability-adjusted life-year rate [ASDR]) were 
estimated by sex, age, and subtypes from 1990 to 2019 at global, regional, and 
national levels. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was used to 
evaluate the changing trends of ASDR and ASMR attributable to ambient PM2.5 from 
1990 to 2019. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to examine the 
correlation between sociodemographic index (SDI) and EAPC of ASMR and ASDR at 
the national level.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global ambient PM2.5-related stroke mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years were 1.14 million and 28.74 million, 
respectively, with the corresponding ASDR and ASMR of 348.1 and 14.3 per 100,000 
population, respectively. The ASDR and ASMR increased with age and were highest 
among male patients, in the middle SDI regions, and for intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH). From 1990 to 2019, the absolute death number of stroke attributable to 
ambient PM2.5 and the corresponding ASMR and ASDR were both in an increasing 
trend. The corresponding EAPCs in ASMR and ASDR were 0.09 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.24) 
and 0.31 (95% CI 0.18-0.44), respectively. The significant increases of ASMR and 
ASDR were observed in the low, low-middle, and middle SDI regions, and for ICH. 
However, a decreasing trend was observed in high and middle-high SDI regions, 
and for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
DISCUSSION: The global burden of stroke attributable to ambient PM2.5 showed an 
increasing trend over the past 30 years, especially in male patients, low-income 
countries, and for ICH. Continued efforts on reducing the level of ambient PM2.5 
are necessary to reduce the burden of stroke.

Correctional health care and Australian prisoners as recipients of kidney 
transplants: Legal and ethical issues.

Australia.

AIM: This research aims to examine the legal and ethical issues surrounding 
Australia prisoners as potential kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Examination of relevant statutory and common law including human rights 
law, state and territory corrections legislation and negligence law. Ethical 
principles considered, particularly in regards to practical and logistical 
considerations including adequate delivery of transplantation medical care and 
implications on the broader organ donation program. Approaches in the United 
States of America and United Kingdom are compared with the Australian approach.
RESULTS: Prisoners are more likely than non-incarcerated individuals to have 
chronic medical conditions. For most people with kidney failure, kidney 
transplantation improves both quality of life and life expectancy compared with 
dialysis therapy. Prisoners have a right to access reasonable medical care under 
state-based corrections legislation, which is underpinned by human rights law 
and ethical principles, primarily beneficence, transparency and justice. The 
right of prisoners to receive reasonable medical care likely extends to ensuring 
prisoners with kidney failure are considered for kidney transplantation and 
waitlisted if medically appropriate. Social factors and logistical factors can 
be relevant when considering eligibility for transplantation as they can relate 
to a person's ability to comply with medical therapy. Additionally, organ 
allocation decisions can be emotive, and a decision to offer a kidney transplant 
to a prisoner may generate significant negative publicity.
CONCLUSION: Prisoners with kidney failure should be considered for kidney 
transplantation. Logistical barriers, such as guard availability, should be 
addressed by state departments responsible for prisoner health.

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of pelvic floor low-frequency electrical 
stimulation combined with anus lifting training in the treatment of urinary 
incontinence after radical prostatectomy in a Chinese cohort. Fifty-five 
patients with urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy were randomly 
divided into treatment group and control group. Patients in control group 
received only anus lifting training therapy, while treatment group combined with 
pelvic floor low-frequency electrical stimulation. The urinary control including 
urinary incontinence questionnaire (ICI-Q-SF), urinary incontinence quality of 
life (I-QOL), visual analogue scale (VAS), and pelvic floor muscle strength 
assessment (Glazer) of the two groups of patients before treatment and every 
week was recorded for statistical analysis. There was a statistically 
significant difference between treatment group and control group in the urinary 
control curve. The scores of ICI-Q-SF, I-QOL, VAS, and Glazer in the treatment 
group after 2 weeks were statistically different from those before treatment, 
and effects were accumulating with the extension of treatment time. Compared 
with the control group, the scores of treatment group in the 2 to 10 weeks 
improved more significantly. Especially, in the sixth week, total effective rate 
of treatment group was significantly better than that of control group (74.07% 
[20/27], 35.71% [10/28], p < .05). The difference between two groups gradually 
narrowed after 10 weeks and no significant difference after 10 weeks of 
treatment between two groups. Pelvic floor low-frequency electrical stimulation 
combined with anus lifting training after radical prostatectomy can 
significantly shorten the recovery time of urinary incontinence in patients 
after radical prostatectomy.

Comprehensive “conservative care” is defined as any active therapeutic procedure 
for the management of stage 5 chronic kidney disease without recourse to 
dialysis. This therapeutic option is discussed in elderly, frail patients whose 
anticipated life expectancy is reduced with dialysis. The decision for 
conservative management primarily relies on an informed choice by the patient 
and his caregivers. This holistic approach, focused on quality of life, requires 
a multidisciplinary approach. The goals are to slow the progression of kidney 
disease, prevent complications, anticipate the risks of decompensation, provide 
support for the patient and his caregivers to maintain the best possible quality 
of life at home. This article describes the principles of conservative 
management, highlights various barriers to this care pathway, and proposes 
potential solutions.

Publisher: Le « traitement conservateur » se définit comme toute procédure 
thérapeutique active de prise en charge de la maladie rénale chronique au stade 
5, sans recours à la suppléance par dialyse. Cette option thérapeutique est 
discutée chez des patients âgés, fragiles, dont l’espérance de vie anticipée est 
réduite en cas de recours à la dialyse. La décision de traitement conservateur 
repose avant tout sur un choix éclairé du patient et de son entourage. Cette 
prise en charge holistique, centrée sur la qualité de vie, nécessite une 
approche multidisciplinaire. Les objectifs sont de ralentir la progression de la 
maladie rénale, d’en prévenir les complications, d’anticiper les risques de 
décompensation, d’assurer un soutien au patient et à ses aidants afin de 
maintenir une qualité de vie la plus acceptable possible à domicile. Cet article 
décrit les principes du traitement conservateur. Nous mettons en perspective 
différents freins à ce parcours de soins, ainsi que les solutions qui pourraient 
être envisagées.

OBJECTIVE: Several risk prediction algorithms have been developed to guide 
antiviral therapy initiation among patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This 
study assessed the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of three risk prediction 
algorithms among patients with CHB in Thailand.
METHODS: A decision tree with a Markov model was constructed. Three risk 
prediction algorithms were compared with current practices including HePAA, 
TREAT-B and REACH-B. PubMed was searched from its inception to December 2022 to 
identify inputs. Tenofovir alafenamide and best supportive care were selected 
for antiviral-eligible patients, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were calculated.
RESULTS: Our base case analysis showed that HePAA and REACH-B could provide 
better QALY (0.098 for HePAA and 0.921 for REACH-B) with decreased total 
healthcare costs (-10909 THB for HePAA and -8,637 THB for REACH-B). TREAT-B 
provided worse QALY (-0.144) with increased total healthcare costs (10,435 THB). 
The budget impacts for HePAA and REACH-B were 387 million THB and 3,653 million 
THB, respectively.
CONCLUSION: HePAA and REACH-B algorithms are cost-effective in guiding antiviral 
therapy initiation. REACH-B is the most cost-effective option, but has a high 
budget impact. Policymakers should consider both cost-effectiveness and budget 
impact findings when deciding which algorithm should be implemented.

Cardio-metabolic diseases are the leading causes of premature death worldwide. 
The conditions are together some of the most prevalent and severe 
multimorbidities and include conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary 
heart disease and stroke. People with these conditions are at a higher risk of 
all-cause death and have a reduction in life expectancy when compared to 
patients without cardio-metabolic disorders. As a result of the increasing 
prevalence and impact of cardio-metabolic multimorbidity on disability, no 
healthcare system can 'treat' its way out of this pandemic. 'Treating our way 
out' requires the use of multiple medications which can lead to improper 
prescribing, insufficient compliance, overdosing or underdosing, improper drug 
choice, insufficient monitoring, unfavourable drug effects, and drug 
interactions and inappropriate wastes and costs. Therefore, individuals living 
with these conditions should be empowered to adopt lifestyle changes that foster 
independent living with their conditions. Adopting these healthy lifestyles such 
as smoking cessation, improving dietary habits, sleep hygiene and physical 
activity is a suitable adjunctive measure if not an alternative to polypharmacy 
in cardio-metabolic multimorbidity.

Proline is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is found in all kingdoms of 
life. It also has remarkable activity as an organocatalyst and is of structural 
importance in many folded polypeptides. Here, we show that prolinyl nucleotides 
with a phosphoramidate linkage are active building blocks in enzyme- and 
ribozyme-free copying of RNA in the presence of monosubstituted imidazoles as 
organocatalysts. Both dinucleotides and mononucleotides are incorporated at the 
terminus of RNA primers in aqueous buffer, as instructed by the template 
sequence, in up to eight consecutive extension steps. Our results show that 
condensation products of amino acids and ribonucleotides can act like nucleoside 
triphosphates in media devoid of enzymes or ribozymes. Prolinyl nucleotides are 
metastable building blocks, readily activated by catalysts, helping to explain 
why the combination of α-amino acids and nucleic acids was selected in molecular 
evolution.

Drivers of Health in sub-Saharan Africa: A Dynamic Panel Analysis.

Chewe M(1), Hangoma P(1).

Globally, life expectancy increased while infant mortality reduced substantially 
between the 19th and late 20th century. Although there is relatively mature 
literature on the drivers behind these gains in life expectancy and reductions 
in infant mortality, there is a dearth of studies that focus on the drivers of 
health in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The few studies that do exist do 
not account for a broader array of determinants such as the quality of access to 
health services and institutional quality which may have important implications 
for health policy. We contribute in filling this gap by estimating the effect of 
a rich set of socio-economic, environmental, health system and lifestyle factors 
on life expectancy and infant mortality using a panel of 30 sub-Saharan African 
countries. We employ a dynamic Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator and 
focus on the period between 1995-2014. Our findings show that increases in 
health expenditure, educational attainment, and health care access quality are 
associated with increases in life expectancy and reductions in infant mortality. 
Higher HIV prevalence rates are associated with reductions in life expectancy 
whereas urbanization, per capita income growth and access to clean water are 
positively associated with life expectancy. We conclude that increases in life 
expectancy and reductions in infant mortality can be accelerated by paying 
particular attention to interventions linked to these drivers, including, health 
care access quality.
