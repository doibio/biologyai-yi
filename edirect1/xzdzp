BACKGROUND: Periodontitis (PDT) has gained attention in the literature with the 
increase in life expectancy of people living with HIV on combined antiretroviral 
therapy (cART). Thus, the search for inflammatory biomarkers could be useful to 
understand the pathophysiology of chronic oral diseases in the cART era.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of non-surgical 
periodontal therapy (NSPT) on clinical parameters of PDT, Candida spp. count and 
expression of lactoferrin (LF) and histatin (HST) in saliva and gingival 
crevicular fluid (GCF) of HIV-infected patients.
METHODS: Bleeding index (BI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level 
(CAL), colonyforming units (CFUs) of Candida spp, and LF and HST levels were 
measured in saliva and GCF of both groups at three different times: baseline 
(before treatment), and 30 and 90 days after the NSPT. Clinical, mycological and 
immunoenzymatic analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two HIV-infected patients and 25 non-HIV-infected patients with 
PDT participated in the study. NSPT was effective in improving periodontal 
clinical parameters, including ≤ 4 sites with PD ≤ 5mm and BI ≤ 10%. Significant 
change in oral Candida spp. count occurred neither between the two groups nor 
after NSPT. And the salivary and GCF levels of LF and HST were not influenced by 
the NSPT; by contrast, except for salivary LF, HST and LF were shown to exhibit 
significantly higher levels in HIV-infected than in non-HIV-infected patients.
CONCLUSION: NSPT was effective in improving periodontal disease parameters in 
HIV-infected patients, but did not affect LF and HST expression in saliva and 
GCF of HIV-infected patients.

BACKGROUND: Implant-supported removable partial dentures (ISRPDs) provide 
effective prosthodontic treatment for partially edentulous patients. ISRPDs 
offer greater patient satisfaction and better oral function compared with 
removable partial dentures (RPDs) by enhancing denture stability and support. 
However, few clinical studies have focused on RPD design in patients with 
mandibular Kennedy Class II edentulism. The aim of this case reports was to 
investigate the oral function, oral health-related quality of life, and 
satisfaction of four patients with unilateral distal-extension mandibular RPDs 
with the same design which were replaced with ISRPDs. In addition, we 
investigated how each patient's evaluation varied with the change from RPD to 
ISRPD.
CASE PRESENTATION: Four patients had unilateral distal-extension mandibular 
edentulism and were missing the first and second molars and the first and second 
premolars. They received one implant (4.0 mm in diameter, 8.0 mm in length; IAT 
EXA PLUS Bone level; Nippon Piston Ring Co. Ltd, Saitama, Japan) at the position 
equivalent to the first molar in the edentulous residual ridge perpendicular to 
the occlusal plane. Implant position was determined by surgical guide plate. 
RPDs were fabricated after the residual mucosal membrane had healed. The basic 
design of the RPD was as follows: a cobalt-chromium alloy cast metal framework 
denture with a lingual bar as the major connector, a double Akers clasp on the 
molars and an auxiliary retainer on the premolar as indirect retainers, and a 
wrought wire clasp and a cast cingulum rest (combination clasp) as direct 
retainers. Masticatory performance, occlusal force, oral health-related quality 
of life, and satisfaction were estimated at baseline, and at time points after 
insertion of the RPD and after insertion of the adapted ISRPD. Each evaluation 
item showed a tendency for improvement on insertion of the new RPD. Masticatory 
performance and satisfaction tended to be better after insertion of the ISRPD 
than after insertion of the RPD.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ISRPDs provided better patient 
satisfaction and masticatory performance than RPDs in patients with mandibular 
Kennedy Class II edentulism. Trial registration UMIN Clinical Trials Registry

The multi-renewable energy complementary system (MRECS) is a good plan that can 
effectively support the accomplishment of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality 
on schedule and take full advantage of renewable resources in rural areas. This 
research investigates the techno-economic feasibility of MRECS in rural areas to 
promote its large-scale implementation. A MRECS with integrated solar, wind, and 
biomass energy is proposed for a rural economic development zone. First, a 
scientific evaluation of the potential for renewable resources in rural areas is 
done. Second, a case study of the Jize Economic Development Zone is applied to 
examine the optimal MRECS configuration. Finally, an economic evaluation model 
that takes environmental benefits into account was created based on life cycle 
costs (LCCs). For the techno-economic analysis, the net present value (NPV), 
dynamic investment payback period, and internal rate of return (IRR) are also 
employed. Findings reveal that (1) the Jize Economic Development Zone has 
considerable development potential due to its abundance of renewable energy 
resources and ability to plan for 168.42 MW of renewable energy units; (2) to 
meet the demand for continuous power generation and realize the sensible use of 
renewable energy, a combination of 10 MW photovoltaic power generation (PV), 
25 MW wind power generation (WT), 2 MW biogas power generation (BG), and 1 MW 
straw direct combustion power generation (SDC) is able to be implemented; (3) 
the provided renewable energy system can save indirect expenses up to 10.60 
million RMB/year, with significant environmental advantages, when compared to 
grid extension; and (4) the NPV of the dynamic investment reaches RMB 322.44 
million after accounting for the environmental advantages in the income of 
MRECS. The dynamic investment payback period is 6.42 years, and the IRR is 
21.44%. According to the findings, the MRECS is economically viable, and 
capitalizing on the environmental advantages can increase those advantages even 
more.

Dyspnea is a common and highly distressing symptom in patients with advanced 
illnesses. Many patients continue to experience chronic dyspnea despite optimal 
management of underlying disease(s) and various non-pharmacologic interventions, 
necessitating the consideration of pharmacologic therapies for palliation of 
dyspnea. One commonly asked question by clinicians is whether benzodiazepines 
have a role in the palliation of dyspnea. In this "Controversies in Palliative 
Care" article, three groups of thought leaders independently answer this 
question. Specifically, each group provides a synopsis of the key studies that 
inform their thought processes, share practical advice on their clinical 
approach, and highlight the opportunities for future research. All three groups 
suggest that benzodiazepines alone do not confer a benefit for dyspnea in 
advanced illnesses based on existing data. They also expressed concerns about 
the potential adverse effects such as delirium and drowsiness and recommended 
against benzodiazepines as first line pharmacologic therapy. Some groups suggest 
that benzodiazepines may be used in highly selected patients with severe anxiety 
associated with dyspnea. Some investigators may also consider the adjunctive use 
of benzodiazepines in patients with severe dyspnea despite opioids, particularly 
if life expectancy is limited. Benzodiazepines also have a role in palliative 
sedation for refractory dyspnea in the last days of life. More research is 
needed to confirm the benefit of benzodiazepines in these populations.

OBJECTIVE: This study reported the burden of gout and its attributable risk 
factors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region between 1990 and 2019 
by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI).
METHODS: Data on the prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability 
(YLD) due to gout were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study for 
the 21 countries in the MENA region, from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: In 2019, the regional age-standardized point prevalence and annual 
incidence rates of gout were 509.1 and 97.7 per 100,000 population, which 
represent a 12% and 11.1% increase since 1990, respectively. Moreover, in 2019 
the regional age-standardized YLD rate was 15.8 per 100,000 population, an 11.7% 
increase since 1990. In 2019, Qatar and Afghanistan had the highest and lowest 
age-standardized YLD rates, respectively. Regionally, the age-standardized point 
prevalence of gout increased with age up to the oldest age group, and it was 
more prevalent among males in all age groups. In addition, there was an overall 
positive association between SDI and the burden of gout between 1990 and 2019. 
In 2019, high BMI (46.1%) was the largest contributor to the burden of gout in 
the MENA region.
CONCLUSION: There were large intercountry variations in the burden of gout, but 
in general, it has increased in MENA over the last 3 decades. This increase is 
in line with the global trends of gout. However, the age-standardized YLD rate 
change was higher in MENA than at the global level.

BACKGROUND: We recently found that the frequency of adding salt to foods could 
reflect a person's long-term salt taste preference and sodium intake, and was 
significantly related to life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: We analyzed whether the frequency of adding salt to foods was 
associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
METHODS: This study included 176,570 adults in UK Biobank who were initially 
free of CVD. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the 
association between the frequency of adding salt to foods and incident CVD 
events.
RESULTS: During a median of 11.8 years of follow-up, 9,963 total CVD events, 
6,993 ischemic heart disease (IHD) cases, 2,007 stroke cases, and 2,269 heart 
failure cases were documented. Lower frequency of adding salt to foods was 
significantly associated with lower risk of total CVD events after adjustment 
for covariates and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (a 
modified DASH score was used without considering sodium intake). Compared with 
the group of always adding salt to foods, the adjusted HRs were 0.81 (95% CI: 
0.73-0.90), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.87), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84) across the 
groups of usually, sometimes, and never/rarely, respectively (P trend < 0.001). 
Among the subtypes of CVD, adding salt showed the strongest association with 
heart failure (P trend <0.001), followed by IHD (P trend < 0.001), but was not 
associated with stroke. We found that participants who combined a DASH-style 
diet with the lowest frequency of adding salt had the lowest CVD risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that lower frequency of adding salt to foods 
is associated with lower risk of CVD, particularly heart failure and IHD.

INTRODUCTION: The link between air pollution-attributed cardiovascular disease 
(APACVD) burden and its contributing factors can aid in detecting 
vulnerabilities and providing forewarnings for India.
METHODS: We examined the association between the status and trends of the APACVD 
burden obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases and Injuries study with the 
two development metrics in India; the human development index (HDI) and indirect 
indices of economic development, namely annual new motor vehicle registration 
and the number of functional factories for 10 years from 2009 to 2019. Lorenz 
curves and concentration index were used to estimate the inequalities in the 
state-APACVD burden and the burden per 100,000 population.
RESULTS: At the state level, APACVD burden was inversely related to the HDI 
value in India for the years 2009 (r=-0.48), 2014 (r=-0.47), and 2019 (r=-0.37), 
and the association was statistically significant (p<0.05). The correlation 
between state-level APACVD burden with the annual new motor vehicle registration 
and the number of functional factories in India for these years was also 
positive and significant (p<0.05). The APACVD was 53% unequally distributed 
across the states, with a concentration index of 0.53 in 2009.
DISCUSSION: We observed that at the state level, the APACVD burden was inversely 
related to HDI. But the APACVD burden increased with the country's economic 
development. Also, the excess APACVD burden appears to be attributable to the 
economically developed states.
CONCLUSION: At the state level, APACVD burden decreased as HDI rose over time, 
indicating that the burden increased with the country's economic development. It 
is noticeable that the economically developed states may be contributing a 
higher share of the APACVD burden in India.

INTRODUCTION: Although dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been approved since 2017 for 
treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, limited data on its safety and 
efficacy are available in clinical practice. The objective was to assess the 
efficacy and safety of DMF in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis 
through 52 weeks in conditions close to real clinical practice.
METHODS: DIMESKIN 1 was a 52-week, open-label, phase IV clinical trial conducted 
at 36 Spanish sites. Adults with diagnosis of moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis, treated with DMF as per its summary of product characteristics and 
with ≥ 1 post-baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) value were 
included [intention-to-treat (ITT) population]. Efficacy analyses were performed 
for ITT population and are based on multiple imputation.
RESULTS: Overall, 282 and 274 patients were included in the safety and ITT 
populations, respectively. At week 24, 46.0%/24.8%/10.9% of patients achieved 
PASI 75/90/100 response, respectively. At week 52, these percentages were 
46.0%/21.9%/10.9%, respectively. Mean body surface area affected decreased from 
17.4% to 6.9%/7.3% after 24/52 weeks (p < 0.001, both). A total of 42.9%/49.4% 
of patients had a Physician's Global Assessment 0-1 at week 24/52, respectively. 
Mean pruritus visual analogue scale (VAS) significantly decreased after 24 and 
52 weeks (p < 0.001, both), with 56.5% and 67.6% of patients, respectively, 
rating a pruritus VAS < 3. At week 24/52, 61.3%/73.4% patients had a Dermatology 
Life Quality Index (DLQI) ≤ 5 and 34.7%/32.1% had a DLQI 0-1. The most frequent 
adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (mainly diarrhea/abdominal pain 
in 50.0%/35.1% of patients, respectively), flushing (28.0%), and lymphopenia 
(31.2%), mostly mild/moderate.
CONCLUSIONS: DMF significantly improves main severity and extension indexes and 
rates, as well as patient-reported outcomes such as pruritus and quality of life 
in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis after 24 weeks of treatment. These 
improvements are sustained through 52 weeks. The safety profile of DMF is 
similar to that previously described for fumarates.

BACKGROUND: In warm regions or seasons of the year, the planetary boundary layer 
is occupied by a huge variety and quantity of insects, but the southward 
migration of insects (in East Asia) in autumn is still poorly understood.
METHODS: We collated daily catches of the oriental armyworm (Mythimna separata) 
moth from 20 searchlight traps from 2014 to 2017 in China. In order to explore 
the autumn migratory connectivity of M. separata in East China, we analyzed the 
autumn climate and simulated the autumn migration process of moths.
RESULTS: The results confirmed that northward moth migration in spring and 
summer under the East Asian monsoon system can bring rapid population growth. 
However, slow southerly wind (blowing towards the north) prevailed over the 
major summer breeding area in North China (33°-40° N) due to a cold 
high-pressure system located there, and this severely disrupts the autumn 
'return' migration of this pest. Less than 8% of moths from the summer breeding 
area successfully migrated back to their winter-breeding region, resulting in a 
sharp decline of the population abundance in autumn. As northerly winds (blowing 
towards the south) predominate at the eastern periphery of a high-pressure 
system, the westward movement of the high-pressure system leads to more 
northerlies over North China, increasing the numbers of moths migrating 
southward successfully. Therefore, an outbreak year of M. separata larvae was 
associated with a more westward position of the high-pressure system during the 
previous autumn.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the southward migration in autumn is 
crucial for sustaining pest populations of M. separata, and the position of the 
cold high-pressure system in September is a key environmental driver of the 
population size in the next year. This study indicates that the autumn migration 
of insects in East China is more complex than previously recognized, and that 
the meteorological conditions in autumn are an important driver of migratory 
insects' seasonal and interannual population dynamics.

Acrometastases are rare lesions that originate most commonly from the primary 
lung cancer. They can mislead the diagnosis and the treatment, since they often 
appear as an osteomyelitis of the affected area. The presence of these 
metastases is a sign of poor prognosis, with a life expectancy of few months. We 
report a case of a 78-year-old male with an acrometastasis to the distal phalanx 
of the right fourth toe. It was the first sign that his previously diagnosed 
large cell lung carcinoma had reached a metastatic stage. Amputation of the toe 
was considered in this case where the intense pain of his acrometastasis could 
not be managed even with strong analgesics.

As modernization continues to advance the development of digital society, social 
media has become an important part of people's daily life and an extension and 
expansion of real social interactions. In this process, social media use and 
individual social psychology have increasingly become the object of academic 
attention, among which the relationship between selfie behavior, as an important 
interaction practice of youth group in social media, and social anxiety needs to 
be further explored and discussed. The purpose of this study is to investigate 
the current situation of selfie behavior, body image, and social anxiety among 
young people in China. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative 
empirical methods, a questionnaire survey was conducted in Chinese mainland 
(n = 920) to examine the mediating effects of social comparison and body image 
on social media selfie behavior and social anxiety, and found that there was a 
significant negative relationship between youth social media selfie behavior and 
social anxiety, while the sequence mediating effects of social comparison and 
body image were significant. The findings of the study provide new ideas and 
directions for exploring the intervention paths of youth social psychology in 
the era of image socialization.

Personal fear of their own death and determination of philosophy of life affects 
the breaking of bad news by internal medicine and palliative care clinicians.

College, Krakow, Poland.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with life-threatening disease should be informed about 
the diagnosis and prognosis of life-expectancy. Breaking bad news (BBN) by a 
clinician may be affected not only by their lack of communication skills but 
also their philosophy of life, beliefs, fear of their own death, their length of 
tenure, and their exposure to dying and death.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This questionnaire-based study aimed to investigate the 
impact of these factors on BBN in internal medicine practitioners (INT) versus 
palliative care physicians (PCP), and to detect the possible impediments to the 
proper communication process and the clinicians' needs regarding their 
preparation for such a conversation.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight PCPs and 64 INTs responded. Determination of philosophy of 
life, but not religiousness, positively correlated with the number of working 
years in palliative care. Two-thirds of the respondents declared fear of death, 
and it diminishes along with working years, especially in palliative care. For 
most physicians, BBN appeared difficult; however, less so for PCPs, persons with 
a high level of determination of philosophy of life, and men. The most frequent 
impediment was insufficient communication skills. Consistently, the respondents 
expressed the need for closing the gap in communication skills, especially by 
mentoring or training on communication.
CONCLUSIONS: Fear of death may restrain inexperienced medical professionals from 
BBN to patients and makes it difficult. Working in palliative care augments the 
determination of philosophy of life and diminishes fear of death. The higher the 
determination of philosophy of life, the more likely BBN is to be performed. 
Philosophy of life, spirituality, and communication skills should be addressed 
in postgraduate education.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) is a debilitating disease that reduces quality of 
life, decreases productivity, and has become a primary cause of health care 
resource consumption. Despite this, many Canadian family physicians have 
received little formal education in managing CP, making it one of the most 
challenging areas of practice in primary care. Project Extension for Community 
Healthcare Outcomes Chronic Pain & Opioid Stewardship St. Joseph's Care Group 
(Project ECHO-SJCG) is an evidence-based educational program connecting 
community-based health care providers (HCPs) with an interprofessional team by 
videoconference to learn about management of CP in rural, remote, and 
underserved areas.
AIMS: To explore key learning points from cases presented at Project ECHO-SJCG, 
identify and analyze themes and improve future sessions of continuing 
professional development for HCPs.
METHODS: We completed a thematic analysis of forty cases and key learning points 
using the constant comparison method. We also summarized descriptive statistics 
for patient and provider characteristics.
RESULTS: Forty cases were presented by 31 HCPs, who received suggestions focused 
on assessment and diagnosis, pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain 
symptom management, interventional management, attention to biopsychosocial 
factors, and appropriate referral to other HCPs.
CONCLUSION: Project ECHO-SJCG cases allow HCPs to gain a broad knowledge base to 
evaluate and manage CP in their practice. Identified themes highlight common 
gaps in HCPs' knowledge and will guide future sessions.

Publisher: Contexte: La douleur chronique est une maladie débilitante qui réduit 
la qualité de vie et diminue la productivité. En outre, elle est devenue une 
cause principale de consommation des ressources en soins de santé. Malgré cela, 
de nombreux médecins de famille canadiens ont reçu peu d'éducation 
conventionnelle sur la prise en charge de la douleur chronique, ce qui en fait 
l'un des domaines de pratique les plus difficiles en soins primaires.Le Projet 
de vulgarisation pour des résultats de santé communautaires – Gestion des 
opioïdes et de la douleur chronique du St. Joseph' s Care Group (projet 
ECHOSJCG) est un programme éducatif fondé sur les données probantes qui met les 
prestataires de soins de santé communautaires en relation avec une équipe 
interprofessionnelle par vidéoconférence pour en apprendre davantage sur la 
prise en charge de la douleur chronique dans les zones rurales, éloignées et mal 
desservies.Objectifs: Explorer les principaux points d'apprentissage à partir 
des cas présentés au projet ECHO-SJCG, recenser et analyser les thèmes et 
améliorer les futures sessions de développement professionnel continu pour les 
professionnels de la santé.Méthodes: Nous avons effectué une analyse thématique 
de quarante cas et points d'apprentissage clés à l'aide de la méthode de 
comparaison constante. Nous avons également résumé les statistiques descriptives 
pour le patient et le prestataire.Résultats: Quarante cas ont été présentés par 
31 professionnels de la santé ayant reçu des suggestions axées sur l'évaluation 
et le diagnostic, la prise en charge des symptômes de douleur pharmacologique et 
non pharmacologique, la prise en charge interventionnelle, l'attention aux 
facteurs biopsychosociaux et l'orientation appropriée vers d'autres 
professionnels de la santé.Conclusions: Les cas du projet ECHO-SJCG permettent 
aux professionnels de la santé d'acquérir une large base de connaissances pour 
l’évaluation et la prise en charge de la douleur chronique dans leur pratique. 
Les thèmes recensés mettent en évidence les lacunes communes dans les 
connaissances des professionnels de la santé et orienteront les sessions 
futures.

AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide and is linked with a regional economic burden. We analysed and 
compared global trends as well as regional and sociodemographic differences in 
CVD incidence and mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained data to annual incident cases, deaths, 
age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), and age-standardized mortality rates 
(ASMRs) of CVD during 1990-2019 from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study. To 
quantify the temporal trends, we calculated changes in the incident cases and 
deaths as well as the estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of 
age-standardized rates. Globally, CVD incident cases increased by 77.12% from 
31.31 million in 1990 to 55.45 million in 2019; deaths rose by 53.81% from 12.07 
million in 1990 to 18.56 million in 2019. The overall ASIR [EAPC, -0.56; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), -0.59 to -0.53] and ASMR (EAPC, -1.46; 95%CI, -1.51 to 
-1.40) decreased in this period. Against the global trend of ASIR falling, an 
increasing trend was found in Uzbekistan (EAPC, 1.24; 95%CI, 0.97-1.50), 
Tajikistan (EAPC, 0.49; 95%CI, 0.47-0.52), and Zimbabwe (EAPC, 0.42; 95%CI, 
0.33-0.50). The number of CVD incident cases increased remarkably in low 
(108.3%), low-middle (114.81%), and middle (117.85%) sociodemographic index 
regions in 1990-2019.
CONCLUSION: Despite the increased number of CVD cases and deaths after adjusting 
for changes in population age, we observed a consistent decrease in 
age-standardized incidence and mortality in most countries. However, specific 
regions-especially low to middle SDI regions-present worrying increases in CVD 
cases and deaths.

Plain Language Summary: This study analysed the global landscape, long-term 
trends, and national and regional differences in CVD incidence and mortality 
from 1990 to 2019. The absolute number of CVD incident cases and deaths remains 
an increasing worldwide—especially in low, low-middle, and middle SDI regions—in 
the years 1990–2019. CVD burden attributable to incidence and mortality are 
rising globally, but the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates are 
declining when considering the population's aging.

The lethal neurotoxins, paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), and tetrodotoxin 
(TTX) have recently been found in marine shellfish from many coastal states. 
Herein, we applied a sensitive and reliable ultra-performance hydrophilic 
interaction chromatography (HILIC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS) method to 
determine 13 PSTs and TTX in marine shellfish using a porous carbon solid-phase 
extraction (SPE). This in-house validation study required the development of a 
novel chromatographic separation using a HILIC-Z column, which was necessary to 
retain highly polar compounds. Using acetonitrile as the organic phase and 
ammonium formate-formic acid buffer as the aqueous phase, the quantitative 
analysis was carried out with an external standard method in the multiple 
reaction monitoring modes using positive electrospray ionization. To reduce 
interference, 1% aqueous acetic acid extracts of the shellfish samples were 
cleaned up by ion-pair SPE using a porous graphitic carbon cartridge. The 
calibration curves for PSTs and TTX were linear (R2 > 0.995), and the 
sensitivity was good, with limits of detection (LODs) of 1.7-13.7 µg/kg, and 
limits of quantitation (LOQs) of 5.2-41.0 µg/kg. The recoveries were 76.5-95.5% 
with RSDs of 3.1-12.0%. Finally, We applied the method for the determination of 
PSTs and TTX in three batches of Nassarius showing excellent method accuracy 
against expected values.

Whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is effective in improving 
long-term survival in an Australian PCI cohort remains unclear. We aimed to 
examine the change in the remaining life expectancy for patients who underwent 
PCI over the past decade. Patient data from the Melbourne Interventional Group 
were divided into four 3-year periods (2005 to 2007, 2008 to 2010, 2011 to 2013, 
and 2014 to 2016) for survival analysis. The primary outcome was time to death 
after PCI. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival were constructed to 
estimate the 5-year survival. To extrapolate the overall survival curve to the 
lifetime time horizon, 6 parametric survival distributions were fitted to the 
individual patient-level data against the Kaplan-Meier curve. The best fit 
distribution was selected based on goodness-of-fit statistics and expert 
opinion. The combination of annual mortality post-PCI from the parametric 
survival analysis and the background mortality by age informed the overall 
mortality rate. The life expectancy was compared with the general Australians. 
In addition, the utility weight of post-PCI patients was used to estimate the 
quality-adjusted life years gained. A total of 27,301 patients with a mean age 
of 64.4 ± 12 years were included. The base-case results showed that over the 4 
time periods, the remaining life expectancy for patients aged 64.4 years on 
average at the time of PCI remained relatively stable except for period 4: 18.12 
years (2005 to 2007), 17.56 years (2008 to 2010), 18.39 years (2011 to 2013), 
and 17.25 years (2014 to 2016), respectively. The quality-adjusted life years 
gained showed a similar trend: 14.86 (2005 to 2007), 14.40 (2008 to 2010), 15.07 
(2011 to 2013), and 14.13 (2014 to 2016) separately. In conclusion, the widened 
gap in life expectancy in post-PCI patients versus the general Australian over 
the 2014 to 2016 period suggests the need for improved implementation of 
prevention strategies for coronary heart disease. Enhanced disease management 
after PCI that lowers residual mortality risk is recommended to extend the 
survival of patients with coronary heart disease.

In the much older population (≥80 years), the management of cardiovascular 
diseases requires specific research to avoid a plain transposition of medical 
practice from younger populations. Whether statins are useful in primary 
prevention in this population is not clear. The 3 intricate issues requiring 
attention are (1) the impact of hypercholesterolemia on mortality and major 
adverse cardiovascular events in subjects >80 years, (2) the efficacy of statins 
to prevent cardiovascular events at this age, and (3) the safety and tolerance 
of statins in this population. Three systematic reviews were performed using a 
search on EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and 
Web of Science databases including publication until January 2021. Among the 
7,617 references identified, 29 were finally retained. Regarding the first 
objective (16 studies, 121,250 participants), 7 studies (10,241 participants) 
did not find total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels associated 
with an increased rate of major cardiovascular events in octogenarians. A total 
of 6 studies (14,493 participants) found increased levels associated with 
events, whereas 3 studies (96,516 participants) found the opposite, with 
increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with lower levels of 
cholesterol. In 8 studies (436,005 participants) addressing the efficacy of 
statins, most did not indicate a significant decrease in the rate of major 
cardiovascular events in these subjects. Finally, regarding tolerance (9 
studies, 217,088 participants), the most important side effects in this 
population were muscular, hepatic, and gastrointestinal disorders. These events 
were more frequent than in the younger population. In conclusion, in the absence 
of convincing evidence, the benefit of statins in primary prevention for much 
older patients is not certain. Their prescription in this setting should only be
