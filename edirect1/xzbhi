years include false-positive mammograms in approximately 200/1000 women screened 
and overdiagnosis (ie, finding breast cancer that would not have clinically 
surfaced otherwise) in approximately 13/1000 women screened. Providing 
information about life expectancy along with potential benefits and harms of 
screening may help older women's decision-making about screening mammography.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For women with less than a 10-year life expectancy, 
recommendations to stop screening mammography should emphasize increased 
potential harms from screening and highlight health promotion measures likely to 
be beneficial over the short term. For women with a life expectancy of more than 
10 years, deciding whether potential benefits of screening outweigh harms 
becomes a value judgment for patients, requiring a realistic understanding of 
screening outcomes.

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of four vitamin D supplementation 
strategies for primary prevention of hip fracture among the elderly population 
and found that the most cost-effective strategy was screening for vitamin D 
insufficiency followed by adequate treatment to attain a minimum 25(OH) serum 
level.
INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D supplementation has a demonstrated ability to reduce the 
incidence of hip fractures. The efficiency of lifetime supplementation has not 
yet been assessed in the population over 65 years without previous hip fracture. 
The objective was to analyze the efficiency of various vitamin D supplementation 
strategies for that population.
METHODS: A Markov micro-simulation model was built with data extracted from 
published studies and from the French reimbursement schedule. Four vitamin D 
supplementation strategies were evaluated on our study population: (1) no 
treatment, (2) supplementation without any serum level check; (3) 
supplementation with a serum level check 3 months after initiation and 
subsequent treatment adaptation; (4) population screening for vitamin D 
insufficiency followed by treatment based on the vitamin D serum level.
RESULTS: "Treat, then check" and "screen and treat" were two cost-effective 
strategies and dominated "treat without check" with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of €5,219/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and 
€9,104/QALY, respectively. The acceptability curves showed that over 
€6,000/QALY, the "screen and treat" strategy had the greatest probability of 
being cost-effective, and the "no treatment" strategy would never be 
cost-effective if society were willing to spend over €8,000/QALY. The 
sensitivity analysis showed that among all parameters varying within realistic 
ranges, the cost of vitamin D treatment had the greatest effect and yet remained 
below the WHO cost-effectiveness thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Population screening for vitamin D insufficiency followed by 
treatment based on the vitamin D serum level is the most cost-effective strategy 
for preventing hip fracture occurrence in the population over 65 years old.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir (SOF)-based triple therapy (TT) 
compared with boceprevir (BOC)- and telaprevir (TVR)-based TT in untreated 
genotype 1 (G1) chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients discriminated according to 
IL28B genotype, severity of liver fibrosis, and G1 subtype. The available 
published literature provided the data source. The target population was made up 
of untreated Caucasian patients, aged 50 years, with G1CHC and these were 
evaluated over a lifetime horizon by Markov model. The study was carried out 
from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. Outcomes included 
discounted costs (in euros at 2013 value), life-years gained (LYG), 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). Cost of SOF was assumed to be € 3,500 per week, i.e., the price 
generating a willingness-to-pay threshold of € 25,000 per LYG compared with TVR 
in the entire population of untreated G1 patients. The robustness of the results 
was evaluated by one-way deterministic and multivariate probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. SOF was cost-effective compared with BOC in all strategies 
with the exception of cirrhosis and IL28B CC patients. In comparison with 
TVR-based strategies, SOF was cost-effective in IL28B CT/TT (ICER per LYG € 
22,229) and G1a (€ 19,359) patients, not cost-effective in IL28B CC (€45,330), 
fibrosis F0-F3 (€ 26,444), and in cirrhosis (€ 34,906) patients, and dominated 
in G1b patients. The models were sensitive to SOF prices and to likelihood of 
sustained virological response.
CONCLUSION: In untreated G1 CHC patients, SOF-based TT may be a cost-effective 
alternative to first-generation protease inhibitors depending on pricing. The 
cost-effectiveness of SOF improved in IL28B CT/TT and G1a patients. SOF was 
dominated by TVR in G1b patients even if, in clinical practice, this issue could 
be counterbalanced by the good tolerability profile of SOF and by the shorter 
treatment duration.

Digital image analysis of high time resolution video microscopy was used to 
investigate hyphal growth dynamics in different Candida albicans strains. The 
effects of the quorum sensing molecules tyrosol and farnesol, the deletion of 
the fungus specific protein phosphatase Z1 CaPPZ1), and the hypha-specific 
cyclin (HGC1) genes were analyzed by this method. Our system monitored cell 
growth in a CO2 incubator under near-physiological conditions and measured three 
major parameters under the following stringent conditions: (a) the time of yeast 
cell adherence, (b) the time of hyphal outgrowth, and (c) the rate of hyphal 
growth. This method showed that hyphal extension of wild-type SC5314 cells was 
accelerated by tyrosol and inhibited by farnesol. Hyphal growth rate was 
moderately lower in cappz1 and strongly reduced in hgc1 mutants. In addition, 
tyrosol treatment caused a firm adherence, while farnesol treatment and hgc1 
mutation prevented the adherence of yeast cells to the surface of the culture 
flask. Transition from yeast-to-hyphal state was faster after tyrosol treatment, 
while it was reduced in farnesol-treated cells as well as in the cappz1 and hgc1 
mutants. Our data confirm the notion that the attachment of yeast cells, the 
yeast-to-hyphal transition, and hyphal growth rate are closely related 
processes. Time-lapse video microscopy combined with image analysis offers a 
convenient and reliable method of testing chemicals, including potential drug 
candidates, and genetic manipulations on the dynamic morphological changes in C. 
albicans strains.

Utility values in health technology assessments: a statistician's perspective.

Whately-Smith C(1), Watkins C, Mann H, Fletcher C, Ducournau P.

Author information:
(1)Whately-Smith Ltd, King's Langley, Hertfordshire, UK.

This paper provides an introduction to utilities for statisticians working 
mainly in clinical research who have not had experience of health technology 
assessment work. Utility is the numeric valuation applied to a health state 
based on the preference of being in that state relative to perfect health. 
Utilities are often combined with survival data in health economic modelling to 
obtain quality-adjusted life years. There are several methods available for 
deriving the preference weights and the health states to which they are applied, 
and combining them to estimate utilities, and the clinical statistician has 
valuable skills that can be applied in ensuring the robustness of the trial 
design, data collection and analyses to obtain and handle this data. In addition 
to raising awareness of the subject and providing source references, the paper 
outlines the concepts and approaches around utilities using examples, discusses 
some of the key issues, and proposes areas where statisticians can collaborate 
with health economic colleagues to improve the quality of this important element 
of health technology assessment.

INTRODUCTION: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 estimated the worldwide 
health burden of 291 diseases and injuries and 67 risk factors by calculating 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Osteoporosis was not considered as a 
disease, and bone mineral density (BMD) was analysed as a risk factor for 
fractures, which formed part of the health burden due to falls.
OBJECTIVES: To calculate (1) the global distribution of BMD, (2) its population 
attributable fraction (PAF) for fractures and subsequently for falls, and (3) 
the number of DALYs due to BMD.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed seeking population-based studies in 
which BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck 
in people aged 50 years and over. Age- and sex-specific mean ± SD BMD values 
(g/cm(2)) were extracted from eligible studies. Comparative risk assessment 
methodology was used to calculate PAFs of BMD for fractures. The theoretical 
minimum risk exposure distribution was estimated as the age- and sex-specific 
90th centile from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES III). Relative risks of fractures were obtained from a previous 
meta-analysis. Hospital data were used to calculate the fraction of the health 
burden of falls that was due to fractures.
RESULTS: Global deaths and DALYs attributable to low BMD increased from 103 000 
and 3 125 000 in 1990 to 188 000 and 5 216 000 in 2010, respectively. The 
percentage of low BMD in the total global burden almost doubled from 1990 
(0.12%) to 2010 (0.21%). Around one-third of falls-related deaths were 
attributable to low BMD.
CONCLUSIONS: Low BMD is responsible for a growing global health burden, only 
partially representative of the real burden of osteoporosis.

Yeast mitochondrial Gln-mtRNAGln is synthesized by the transamidation of 
mischarged Glu-mtRNAGln by a non-canonical heterotrimeric tRNA-dependent 
amidotransferase (AdT). The GatA and GatB subunits of the yeast AdT (GatFAB) are 
well conserved among bacteria and eukaryota, but the GatF subunit is a 
fungi-specific ortholog of the GatC subunit found in all other known 
heterotrimeric AdTs (GatCAB). Here we report the crystal structure of yeast 
mitochondrial GatFAB at 2.0 Å resolution. The C-terminal region of GatF 
encircles the GatA-GatB interface in the same manner as GatC, but the N-terminal 
extension domain (NTD) of GatF forms several additional hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic interactions with GatA. NTD-deletion mutants displayed growth 
defects, but retained the ability to respire. Truncation of the NTD in purified 
mutants reduced glutaminase and transamidase activities when glutamine was used 
as the ammonia donor, but increased transamidase activity relative to the 
full-length enzyme when the donor was ammonium chloride. Our structure-based 
functional analyses suggest the NTD is a trans-acting scaffolding peptide for 
the GatA glutaminase active site. The positive surface charge and novel fold of 
the GatF-GatA interface, shown in this first crystal structure of an organellar 
AdT, stand in contrast with the more conventional, negatively charged bacterial 
AdTs described previously.

Cost-effectiveness of the convergent procedure and catheter ablation for 
non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with persistent or longstanding atrial fibrillation have 
modest success achieving sinus rhythm with catheter ablation or rhythm control 
medications. Their high risk of stroke, bleed, and heart failure leads to 
significant morbidity and health care costs. The convergent procedure has been 
shown to be successful in this population, with 80% of patients in sinus rhythm 
after 1 year. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the convergent 
procedure, catheter ablation, and medical management for non-paroxysmal AF 
patients.
METHODS: A Markov micro-simulation model was used to estimate costs and 
effectiveness from a payer perspective. Parameter estimates were from the 
literature. Three patient cohorts were simulated, representing lower, medium, 
and higher risks of stroke, bleed, heart failure, and hospitalization. Effects 
were estimated by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Single-variable 
sensitivity analysis was performed.
RESULTS: After 5 years, convergent procedure patients averaged 1.10 procedures, 
with 75% of survivors in sinus rhythm; catheter ablation patients had 1.65 
procedures, with 49% in sinus rhythm. Compared to medical management, catheter 
ablation and the convergent procedure were cost-effective for the lower risk 
(ICER <$35,000) and medium risk (ICER <$15,000) cohorts. The procedures 
dominated medical management for the higher risk cohort (lower cost and higher 
QALYs). The convergent procedure dominated catheter ablation for all risk 
cohorts. RESULTS were subject to simplifying assumptions and limited by 
uncertain factors such as long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after successful 
procedure and incremental AF-associated event rates for AF patients relative to 
patients in sinus rhythm. In the absence of clinical trial data, convergent 
procedure efficacy was estimated with observational evidence. Limitations were 
addressed with sensitivity analyses and a moderate 5 year time horizon.
CONCLUSION: The convergent procedure results in superior maintenance of 
post-ablation sinus rhythm with fewer repeat ablation procedures compared to 
catheter ablation, leading to lower cost and higher QALYs after 5 years.

Variation of color discrimination across the life span.

Paramei GV, Oakley B.

The present study, an extension of Paramei [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, 29, A290, 2012], 
provides normative data on chromatic discrimination, using the Cambridge Colour 
Test, for normal trichromats aged 10-88 years. Findings are in accord with a 
two-phase variation across the life span: chromatic sensitivity improves in 
adolescence, reaches a maximum around 30 years, and then undergoes a gradual 
decrease. Indicative parameters are Protan (P), Deutan (D), and Tritan (T) 
vector lengths and major axes and axis ratios of Ellipses. Trivector data are 
modeled as non-monotonic combinations of power functions, with goodness-of-fits 
R(P)2=0.23, R(D)2=0.23, and R(T)2=0.45. For advancing age, sensitivity decline 
in all chromatic systems was confirmed, though with a marked acceleration after 
60 years (reflected by the power function exponent >1) and more pronounced for 
the tritan system.

Ewing's sarcoma is a small, blue, round-cell tumor of mesenchymal origin which 
typically presents itself during the first and the second decades of life. 
Typically, it is noticed in the long bones of the limbs, pelvis, or ribs. There 
have been few reports worldwide with none in Pakistan of this rare phenomenon. 
We report here the case of a 16-year-old female diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma 
with intracranial extension abutting the temporal lobe resulting in proptosis 
and partial loss of vision in the left eye. The purpose of this case is to 
discuss the clinicoradiological presentation, microscopic description, and 
management of the patient.

Population mortality forecasts are widely used for allocating public health 
expenditures, setting research priorities, and evaluating the viability of 
public and private pensions, and health care financing systems. In part because 
existing methods forecast less accurately when based on more information, most 
forecasts are still based on simple linear extrapolations that ignore known 
biological risk factors and other prior information. We adapt a Bayesian 
hierarchical forecasting model capable of including more known health and 
demographic information than has previously been possible. This leads to the 
first age- and sex-specific forecasts of American mortality that simultaneously 
incorporate, in a formal statistical model, the effects of the recent rapid 
increase in obesity, the steady decline in tobacco consumption, and the well 
known patterns of smooth mortality age profiles and time trends. Formally 
including new information in forecasts can matter a great deal. For example, we 
estimate an increase in male life expectancy at birth from 76.2 years in 2010 to 
79.9 years in 2030, which is 1.8 years greater than the U.S. Social Security 
Administration projection and 1.5 years more than U.S. Census projection. For 
females, we estimate more modest gains in life expectancy at birth over the next 
twenty years from 80.5 years to 81.9 years, which is virtually identical to the 
Social Security Administration projection and 2.0 years less than U.S. Census 
projections. We show that these patterns are also likely to greatly affect the 
aging American population structure. We offer an easy-to-use approach so that 
researchers can include other sources of information and potentially improve on 
our forecasts too.

Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC) is a rare disease with a poor prognosis which 
typically presents in the 6(th) decade of life. Of the 3,000 cases seen annually 
in the United States, less than one half of these tumors are resectable. A 
variety of risk factors have been associated with HC, most notably primary 
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary stone disease and parasitic liver disease. 
Patients typically present with abdominal pain, pruritis, weight loss, and 
jaundice. Computed topography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 
ultrasound (US) are used to characterize biliary lesions. Endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography 
(PTC) assess local ductal extent of the tumor while allowing for therapeutic 
biliary drainage. MRCP has demonstrated similar efficacies to PTC and ERCP in 
identifying anatomic extension of tumors with less complications. Treatment 
consists of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. Biliary 
drainage of the future liver remnant should be performed to decrease bilirubin 
levels thereby facilitating future liver hypertrophy. Standard therapy consists 
of surgical margin-negative (R0) resection with extrahepatic bile duct 
resection, hepatectomy and en bloc lymphadenectomy. Local resection should not 
be undertaken. Lymph node invasion, tumor grade and negative margins are 
important prognostic indicators. In instances where curative resection is not 
possible, liver transplantation has demonstrated acceptable outcomes in highly 
selected patients. Despite the limited data, chemotherapy is indicated for 
patients with unresectable tumors and adequate functional status. Five-year 
survival after surgical resection of HC ranges from 10% to 40% however, 
recurrence can be as high as 50-70% even after R0 resection. Due to the 
complexity of this disease, a multi-disciplinary approach with multimodal 
treatment is recommended for this complex disease.

Mitochondria play numerous, essential roles in the life of eukaryotes. 
Disruption of mitochondrial function in humans is often pathological or even 
lethal. Surprisingly, in some organisms mitochondrial dysfunction can result in 
life extension. This paradox has been studied most extensively in the long-lived 
Mit mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In this review, we explore 
the major responses that are activated following mitochondrial dysfunction in 
these animals and how these responses potentially act to extend their life. We 
focus our attention on five broad areas of current research--reactive oxygen 
species signaling, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, autophagy, 
metabolic adaptation, and the roles played by various transcription factors. 
Lastly, we also examine why disruption of complexes I and II differ in their 
ability to induce the Mit phenotype and extend lifespan.

INTRODUCTION: This study assesses the effects of obesity, physical inactivity 
and smoking on life expectancy (LE) differences between educational groups in 
five European countries in the early 2000s.
METHODS: We estimate the contribution of risk factors on LE differences between 
educational groups using the observed risk factor distributions and under a 
hypothetically more optimal risk factor distribution. Data on risk factor 
prevalence were obtained from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in 
Europe study, and data on mortality from census-linked data sets for the age 
between 50 and 79 according to sex and education.
RESULTS: Substantial differences in LE of up to 2.8 years emerged between men 
with a low and a high level of education in Denmark, Austria and France, and 
smaller differences among men in Italy and Spain. The educational differences in 
LE were not as large among women. The largest potential for reducing educational 
differences was in Denmark (25% among men and 41% among women) and Italy (14% 
among men).
CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the effect of unhealthy behaviours on educational 
differences in LE varied between countries. LE among those with a low or medium 
level of education could increase in some European countries if the behavioural 
risk factor distributions were similar to those observed among the highly 
educated.

Background and Purpose. Life expectancy data could identify men with favorable 
post-radiation prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure kinetics unlikely to 
require androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Materials and Methods. Of 206 men 
with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer in a randomized trial of radiation versus 
radiation and ADT, 53 experienced a PSA failure and were followed without 
salvage ADT. Comorbidity, age and established prognostic factors were assessed 
for relationship to death using Cox regression analyses. Results. The median age 
at failure, interval to PSA failure, and PSA doubling time were 76.6 years 
(interquartile range [IQR]: 71.8-79.3), 49.1 months (IQR: 37.7-87.4), and 25 
months (IQR: 13.1-42.8), respectively. After a median follow up of 4.0 years 
following PSA failure, 45% of men had died, none from prostate cancer and no one 
had developed metastases. Both increasing age at PSA failure (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 
1.03-1.25; P = 0.008) and the presence of moderate to severe comorbidity (HR: 
12.5; 95% CI: 3.81-41.0; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with an 
increased risk of death. Conclusions. Men over the age of 76 with significant 
comorbidity and a PSA doubling time >2 years following post-radiation PSA 
failure appear to be good candidates for observation without ADT intervention.

The multicellular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was used to 
identify the anti-aging effect of pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) isolated from 
Eucalyptus leaves at four different concentrations. For 160 μM PGG, the median 
lifespan of C. elegans was found to increase by 18%, and the thermal stress 
resistance was also increased. The anti-aging effect of PGG did not cause side 
effects on the physiological functions including the reproduction, pharyngeal 
pumping rate, age pigments accumulation, and locomotion ability. The life 
extension induced by PGG was found to rely on genes daf-16, age-1, eat-2, 
sir-2.1, and isp-1 but did not rely on genes mev-1 and clk-1. These findings 
suggested that the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, dietary restriction, Sir-2.1 
signaling, and mitochondrial electron transport chain became partly involved 
with the mechanism of lifespan extension mediated by PGG. Our results provided 
an insight into the mechanism of longevity extension mediated by PGG in C. 
elegans, which might be developed into a new generation of multitarget drug to 
prolong lifespan.

INTRODUCTION: Pain is a symptom of cancer and is categorized in two forms: 
background pain to be treated with analgesics, and breakthrough cancer pain 
(BTcP), which needs drug treatment on demand. We present a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of transnasal fentanyl citrate as an alternative to morphine.
METHODS: A Markov model considers a cohort of 100 patients on a daily basis. 
Effectiveness was included by selecting three clinical studies. Side effects, 
hospitalizations and visits were valued by referring to national formularies. 
Utility data were used to differentiate the health status inherent to BTcP.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of transnasal fentanyl citrate 
is 10,140 euros/QALY. Sensitivity analysis shows that with a threshold of 30,000 
euros/QALY, the treatment of BTcP with transnasal fentanyl citrate would have an 
86% probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Transnasal Fentanyl citrate is cost-effective, therefore represents 
a good investment in health.

Youth, which is forgiven everything, forgives itself nothing: age, which 
forgives itself everything, is forgiven nothing. George Bernard Shaw The 
proportion of older people in the general population is steadily increasing 
worldwide, with the most rapid growth in low-and middle-income countries [1]. 
This demographic change is to be celebrated, because it is the consequence of 
socioeconomic development and better life expectancy. However, population aging 
also has important implications for society - in diverse areas including health 
systems, labor markets, public policy, social programs, and family dynamics [2]. 
A successful response to the aging population will require capitalizing on the 
opportunities that this transition offers, as well as effectively addressing its 
challenges. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem 
that is characterized by poor health outcomes and very high health care costs. 
CKD is a major risk multiplier in patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart 
disease and stroke - all of which are key causes of death and disability in 
older people [3]. Since the prevalence of CKD is higher in older people, the 
health impact of population aging will depend in part on how the kidney 
community responds. March 13, 2014 will mark the celebration of the 9th World 
Kidney Day (WKD), an annual event jointly sponsored by the International Society 
of Nephrology and the International Federation of Kidney Foundations. Since its 
inception in 2006, WKD has become the most successful effort to raise awareness 
among policymakers and the general public about the importance of kidney 
disease. The topic for WKD 2014 is "CKD in older people". This article reviews 
the key links between kidney function, age, health and illness - and discusses 
the implications of the aging population for the care of people with CKD.

Urbanization and health in developing countries: a systematic review.

University Medical Center, Berlin, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Future population growth will take place predominantly in cities of 
the developing world. The impact of urbanization on health is discussed 
controversially. We review recent research on urban-rural and intra-urban health 
differences in developing countries and investigate whether a health advantage 
was found for urban areas.
METHODS: We systematically searched the databases JSTOR, PubMed, ScienceDirect 
and SSRN for studies that compare health status in urban and rural areas. The 
studies had to examine selected World Health Organization health indicators.
RESULTS: Eleven studies of the association between urbanization and the selected 
health indicators in developing countries met our selection criteria. 
Urbanization was associated with a lower risk of undernutrition but a higher 
risk of overweight in children. A lower total fertility rate and lower odds of 
giving birth were found for urban areas. The association between urbanization 
and life expectancy was positive but insignificant. Common risk factors for 
chronic diseases were more prevalent in urban areas. Urban-rural differences in 
mortality from communicable diseases depended on the disease studied.
CONCLUSION: Several health outcomes were correlated with urbanization in 
developing countries. Urbanization may improve some health problems developing 
countries face and worsen others. Therefore, urbanization itself should not be 
embraced as a solution to health problems but should be accompanied by an 
informed and reactive health policy.

PURPOSE: This article contains a comparative analysis and evaluation of the 
effectiveness of population policies in European Union (EU) countries, using 
multivariate analysis.
DATA AND METHODS: To study these differences, it is primarily necessary to have 
the relevant data. The most recent database available was developed by the OECD 
in 2007 and currently covers OECD countries and most EU Member States. We used 
multivariate analysis to categorize the indicators into the following groups: 
(a) economic indicators, (b) indicators reconciling work and family life, and 
(c) demographic indicators.
RESULTS: The results of measuring the degree of coherence of factors reveal that 
the four most important factors influencing the effectiveness of population 
policy are (i) the average maternal age at first childbirth, (ii) social 
protection expenditure, (iii) GDP, and (iv) public spending for benefits. Based 
on the data from the evaluation of the correlation matrix of variables and data, 
the classification of countries, according to the values of the coefficients of 
analysis, appears as follows: the Nordic countries (together with France and the 
United Kingdom), the Southern European countries and the Northern countries: 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania (by a very slight margin Romania), and Bulgaria, 
Poland, Slovakia (and, marginally, Malta).
CONCLUSIONS: The key comparative findings from benchmarking best practices in 
the context of the European experience are the following: The EU is being 
demographically transformed as a direct result of an increase in average life 
expectancy and immigration and a decrease in fertility. Demographic factors are 
influenced by specific features, in contrast with economic factors which seem be 
less stable.

INTRODUCTION: One third of all breast cancers occur in women over the age of 70. 
Primary endocrine therapy (PET) is used in some women to minimise morbidity in a 
population with higher rates of comorbidity and frailty. In the UK up to 40% of 
women over 70 are treated with PET although there is a high rate of variability 
of practice between centres reflecting a lack of guidance about case selection.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed to try and 
establish if this form of treatment is still valid in modern breast practice.
RESULTS: Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 31 non-randomised studies 
were deemed eligible. Available data demonstrate an advantage for surgery over 
PET in terms of disease control and a likely survival benefit in patients with a 
predicted life expectancy of five years or more. Patients treated only with 
aromatase inhibitors (AIs) had superior rates of disease control when compared 
to Tamoxifen.
CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines to aid selection are needed but PET should be reserved 
for patients with reduced predicted life expectancy (e.g. less than five years), 
with AIs being preferable over Tamoxifen.

The objective of this systematic literature review is to discuss the latest 
French recommendation issued in 2012 that a fall within the past year should 
lead to bone mineral density (BMD) measurement using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA). This recommendation rests on four facts. First, 
osteoporosis and fall risk are the two leading risk factors for nonvertebral 
fractures in postmenopausal women. Second, BMD measurement using DXA supplies 
significant information on the fracture risk independently from the fall risk. 
Thus, when a fall occurs, the fracture risk increases as BMD decreases. Third, 
osteoporosis drugs have been proven effective in preventing fractures only in 
populations with osteoporosis defined based on BMD criteria. Finally, the 
prevalence of osteoporosis is high in patients who fall and increases in the 
presence of markers for frailty (e.g., recurrent falls, sarcopenia [low muscle 
mass and strength], limited mobility, and weight loss), which are risk factors 
for both osteoporosis and falls. Nevertheless, life expectancy should be taken 
into account when assessing the appropriateness of DXA in fallers, as 
osteoporosis treatments require at least 12months to decrease the fracture risk. 
Another relevant factor is the availability of DXA, which may be limited due to 
geographic factors, patient dependency, or severe cognitive impairments, for 
instance. Studies are needed to better determine how the fall risk and frailty 
should be incorporated into the fracture risk evaluation based on BMD and the 
FRAX® tool.
