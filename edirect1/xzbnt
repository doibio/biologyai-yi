showed that, for the average-risk population, higher specificity of Lugol's 
iodine (> 40%) and lower specificity of HRME (< 70%) could make Lugol's iodine 
screening cost-effective. For the high-risk population, the results of the model 
were not substantially affected by varying the follow-up rate after Lugol's 
iodine screening, Lugol's iodine test characteristics (sensitivity and 
specificity), or HRME specificity.
CONCLUSION: The incorporation of HRME into an ESCC screening program could be 
cost-effective in China. Larger studies of HRME performance are needed to 
confirm these findings.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006;(3):CD001556.

BACKGROUND: Surgery has been the treatment of choice for patients with localized 
esophageal cancer. Several studies have investigated whether preoperative 
chemotherapy followed by surgery leads to improvement in cure rates, but 
individual reports have provided conflicting results. An explicit systematic 
update of the role of preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of patients 
with resectable thoracic esophageal cancer is, therefore, warranted.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to determine the role of 
preoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with resectable thoracic 
esophageal carcinoma.
SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register 
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to 2013), EMBASE (1988 to 2013), 
and CANCERLIT (1993 to 2013). We did not confine our search to English language 
publications. We updated searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE in October 
2013.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials of patients with potentially resectable carcinoma 
of the esophagus (of any histologic type) who were randomly assigned to 
chemotherapy or no chemotherapy before surgery.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was survival, which was 
assessed with the use of hazard ratios. This is an amendment to the original 
review, which used risk ratios to assess survival at yearly intervals. Hazard 
ratios (HRs) have now been introduced to summarize the complete survival 
experience in a single analysis. Risk ratios (RRs) were used to compare rates of 
resection, tumor recurrences, and treatment morbidity and mortality.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified a total of 13 randomized trials involving 2362 
participants. Ten trials (2122 participants) reported sufficient detail on 
survival to be included in a meta-analysis for the primary outcome. Preoperative 
chemotherapy improves overall survival (HR 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.80 to 0.96) and is associated with a significantly higher rate of complete 
(R0) resection (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19).No evidence suggests that the 
overall rate of resection (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01), tumor recurrence (RR 
0.81, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.22) or nonfatal complications (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.76 to 
1.06) was different for preoperative chemotherapy compared with surgery alone. 
Trials reported risks of toxicity with chemotherapy that ranged from 11% to 90%.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In summary, preoperative chemotherapy plus surgery offers 
a survival advantage compared with surgery alone for patients with resectable 
thoracic esophageal cancer, but the evidence is of moderate quality. Some 
evidence of toxicity and preoperative mortality have been associated with 
chemotherapy.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are highly persistent anthropogenic 
contaminants found in the environment, posing a risk to aquatic ecosystems, 
whereas there is a lack of data concerning their impacts on marine 
invertebrates. The objective of this study was to assess the relative lethal and 
sublethal aquatic toxicity effects of two PBDEs, BDE-47 and BDE-209 congeners, 
on marine zooplankton rotifer Brachionus plicatilis associated with PBDE 
concentrations and time of exposure. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS) analyses were performed to determine actual PBDE concentrations. Rotifer 
population demographic parameters from life tables, including age-specific 
survivorship (lx), age-specific fecundity (mx), net reproductive rate (R0), 
intrinsic rate of increase (rm), finite rate of increase (λ), life expectancy 
(E0) and generation time (T), were used as measures of treatment effects. 
Results from this study have revealed increasingly intense negative effects on 
many of the rotifer demographic parameters with elevated PBDE concentrations. 
The population growth curves of B. plicatilis showed almost no lag phase and 
reached peak abundances within 11 days, while B. plicatilis exposed to BDE-209 
had a lag phase of about 5 days. In addition, increased PBDE levels reduced the 
population abundances and peak population densities of B. plicatilis. The two 
PBDEs have caused the carrying capacity (K) suppressed and the negative 
influence turned more serious as the concentration rose. Results also revealed 
that the time to reach growth curve inflection point (Tp) was shortened by PBDEs 
to different degrees. This study not only indicated that life table demography 
and population growth curve studies were two important aspects used to evaluate 
toxicant PBDE effects, but also compared the two PBDE disruptions to the 
population growth and reproduction of the rotifer.

Cost-effectiveness of Chlamydia vaccination programs for young women.

Owusu-Edusei K Jr, Chesson HW, Gift TL, Brunham RC, Bolan G.

We explored potential cost-effectiveness of a chlamydia vaccine for young women 
in the United States by using a compartmental heterosexual transmission model. 
We tracked health outcomes (acute infections and sequelae measured in 
quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and determined incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a 50-year analytic horizon. We assessed 
vaccination of 14-year-old girls and catch-up vaccination for 15-24-year-old 
women in the context of an existing chlamydia screening program and assumed 2 
prevaccination prevalences of 3.2% by main analysis and 3.7% by additional 
analysis. Estimated ICERs of vaccinating 14-year-old girls were $35,300/QALY by 
main analysis and $16,200/QALY by additional analysis compared with only 
screening. Catch-up vaccination for 15-24-year-old women resulted in estimated 
ICERs of $53,200/QALY by main analysis and $26,300/QALY by additional analysis. 
The ICER was most sensitive to prevaccination prevalence for women, followed by 
cost of vaccination, duration of vaccine-conferred immunity, and vaccine 
efficacy. Our results suggest that a successful chlamydia vaccine could be 
cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: Differential pricing, based on countries' purchasing power, is 
recommended by the World Health Organization to secure affordable medicines. 
However, in developing countries innovative drugs often have similar or even 
higher prices than in high-income countries. We evaluated the potential 
implications of trastuzumab global pricing policies in terms of 
cost-effectiveness (CE), coverage, and accessibility for patients with breast 
cancer in Latin America (LA).
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to estimate life-years (LYs), 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs from a healthcare perspective. To 
better fit local cancer prognosis, a base case scenario using transition 
probabilities from clinical trials was complemented with two alternative 
scenarios with transition probabilities adjusted to reflect breast cancer 
epidemiology in each country.
RESULTS: Incremental discounted benefits ranged from 0.87 to 1.00 LY and 0.51 to 
0.60 QALY and incremental CE ratios from USD 42,104 to USD 110,283 per QALY 
(2012 U.S. dollars), equivalent to 3.6 gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) 
per QALY in Uruguay and to 35.5 GDPPC in Bolivia. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed 0 percent probability that trastuzumab is CE if the 
willingness-to-pay threshold is one GDPPC per QALY, and remained so at three 
GDPPC threshold except for Chile and Uruguay (4.3 percent and 26.6 percent, 
respectively). Trastuzumab price would need to decrease between 69.6 percent to 
94.9 percent to became CE in LA.
CONCLUSIONS: Although CE in other settings, trastuzumab was not CE in LA. The 
use of health technology assessment to prioritize resource allocation and 
support price negotiations is critical to making innovative drugs available and 
affordable in developing countries.

AIMS: The aim of the analysis was to investigate whether insulin 
intensification, based on the use of intensive insulin regimens as recommended 
by the current standard of care in routine clinical practice, would be 
cost-effective for patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK.
METHODS: Clinical data were derived from a retrospective analysis of 3185 
patients with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin in The Health Improvement Network 
(THIN) general practice database. In total, 48% (614 patients) intensified 
insulin therapy, defined by adding bolus or premix insulin to a basal regimen, 
which was associated with a reduction in HbA1c and an increase in body mass 
index. Projections of clinical outcomes and costs (2011 GBP) over patients' 
lifetimes were made using a recently validated type 2 diabetes model.
RESULTS: Immediate insulin intensification was associated with improvements in 
life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and time to onset of 
complications versus no intensification or delaying intensification by 2, 4, 6, 
or 8 years. Direct costs were higher with the insulin intensification strategy 
(due to the acquisition costs of insulin). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
for insulin intensification were GBP 32,560, GBP 35,187, GBP 40,006, GBP 48,187 
and GBP 55,431 per QALY gained versus delaying intensification 2, 4, 6 and 8 
years, and no intensification, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although associated with improved clinical outcomes, insulin 
intensification as practiced in the UK has a relatively high cost per QALY and 
may not lead to cost-effective outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes as 
currently defined by UK cost-effectiveness thresholds.

OBJECTIVE: There is a concern that cost-effectiveness analysis using 
quality-adjusted life years does not capture all valuable benefits of 
treatments. The objective of this study was to determine the value society 
places on aspects of RA treatment to inform policymaking.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was administered to a representative 
sample of the Canadian general population. The discrete choice experiment, 
developed using focus groups, had seven attributes (route and frequency of 
administration, chance of benefit, chance of serious and minor side effects, 
confidence in evidence and life expectancy). A conditional logit regression 
model was used to estimate the significance and relative importance of 
attributes in influencing preferences on the quality-adjusted life years scale.
RESULTS: Responses from 733 respondents who provided rational responses were 
analysed. Six attribute levels within four attributes significantly influenced 
preferences for treatments: a willingness to trade a year of life expectancy 
over a 10-year period to increase the probability of benefiting from treatment, 
or two-thirds of a year to reduce minor or serious side effects to the lowest 
level or improve the confidence in benefit/side-effect estimates. There was also 
some evidence of a preference for oral drug delivery, though a subgroup analysis 
suggested this preference was restricted to injection-naive respondents.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest society values the degree of confidence in the 
estimates of risks and benefits of RA treatments and the route of 
administration, as well as benefits and side effects. This study provides 
important evidence to policymakers determining the cost-effectiveness of 
treatments in arthritis.

Propionic acidemia (PA) and classical methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are rare 
inborn errors of metabolism that can cause early mortality and significant 
morbidity. The mainstay of disease management is lifelong protein restriction. 
As an alternative, liver transplantation (LT) may improve survival, quality of 
life, and prevent further neurological deterioration. The aim of our study was 
to estimate the incremental costs and outcomes of LT versus nutritional support 
in patients with early-onset MMA or PA. We constructed a Markov model to 
simulate and compare life expectancies, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
lifetime direct and indirect costs for a cohort of newborns with MMA or PA who 
could either receive LT or be maintained on conventional nutritional support. We 
conducted a series of 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the base 
case, LT on average resulted in 1.5 more life years lived, 7.9 more QALYs, and a 
savings of $582,369 for lifetime societal cost per individual compared to 
nutritional support. LT remained more effective and less costly in all 1-way 
sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, LT was 
cost-effective at the $100,000/QALY threshold in more than 90% of the 
simulations and cost-saving in over half of the simulations. LT is likely a 
dominant treatment strategy compared to nutritional support in newborns with 
classical MMA or PA.

The PANCOSTABRAX study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nanoparticle 
albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in combination with gemcitabine (GEM) 
versus GEM alone in the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer 
in Spain. Efficacy data were obtained from the MPACT study and were modeled to a 
lifetime horizon using a Markov model. The analysis was performed from the 
payer's perspective. Use of resources and key assumptions of the analysis were 
validated by a panel of oncologists. The addition of nab-paclitaxel to GEM 
showed higher effectiveness results (0.156 additional quality adjusted life 
years) at a higher cost (€6,477), resulting in a cost per quality-adjusted life 
years gained of €41,519. The combination of nab-paclitaxel and GEM has been 
shown to be an effective and well-tolerated option for the treatment of 
metastatic pancreatic cancer and, in addition to becoming the new standard of 
care, could also be considered a cost-effective option.

HIV treatment is based on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) which has 
substantially improved survival, thus resulting in an increase in patient life 
expectancy as well as in the cost of HIV-related medical care. Therefore, 
several cost effectiveness studies were implemented worldwide, with one 
specifically in the Liguria region (Italy), to compare the annual economic 
expense in this area for HIV services, and the related improvement in patients' 
health. The IANUA project is intended to implement both cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility analysis, therefore data related to clinical indicators and 
perceived health status were collected, the latter using a questionnaire based 
on the EQ-5D-3L. Information about the antiretroviral drugs and the relative 
quantity that a patient withdraws from the hospital pharmacy every month were 
extracted from the regional "F-file". All data gathered were stored in the 
Ligurian HIV Network, a web platform developed by the DIBRIS - Medinfo 
laboratory. More than eight hundred questionnaires were collected, and data will 
be elaborated by economists and psychologists. The first statistical 
elaborations showed that, as expected, costs increased as the number of 
therapeutic lines increased. Moreover, the average annual costs for patients 
whose last CD4 values were below 200 cells/mmc corresponded to the maximum 
expense recorded, however, the cost for patients with final CD4 counts above 500 
cells/mmc was not, as expected, the lowest found. This can be explained by the 
fact that stabilized patients, who had CD4 values below 500 cells/mmc, did not 
need very expensive care, while patients with CD4 counts above 500 cells/mmc 
improved their health status thanks to cART.

BACKGROUND: The worldwide increase in life expectancy has been associated with 
an increase in age-related morbidities. The underlying mechanisms resulting in 
immunosenescence are only incompletely understood. Chronic viral infections, in 
particular infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), have been suggested as a 
main driver in immunosenescence. Here, we propose that rhesus macaques could 
serve as a relevant model to define the impact of chronic viral infections on 
host immunity in the aging host. We evaluated whether chronic rhesus CMV (RhCMV) 
infection, similar to HCMV infection in humans, would modulate normal 
immunological changes in the aging individual by taking advantage of the unique 
resource of rhesus macaques that were bred and raised to be Specific Pathogen 
Free (SPF-2) for distinct viruses.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that normal age-related immunological changes 
in frequencies, activation, maturation, and function of peripheral blood cell 
lymphocytes in humans occur in a similar manner over the lifespan of rhesus 
macaques. The comparative analysis of age-matched SPF-2 and non-SPF macaques 
that were housed under identical conditions revealed distinct differences in 
certain immune parameters suggesting that chronic pathogen exposure modulated 
host immune responses. All non-SPF macaques were infected with RhCMV, suggesting 
that chronic RhCMV infection was a major contributor to altered immune function 
in non-SPF macaques, although a causative relationship was not established and 
outside the scope of these studies. Further, we showed that immunological 
differences between SPF-2 and non-SPF macaques were already apparent in 
adolescent macaques, potentially predisposing RhCMV-infected animals to 
age-related pathologies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data validate rhesus macaques as a relevant animal model to 
study how chronic viral infections modulate host immunity and impact 
immunosenescence. Comparative studies in SPF-2 and non-SPF macaques could 
identify important mechanisms associated with inflammaging and thereby lead to 
new therapies promoting healthy aging in humans.

INTRODUCTION:  Benign idiopathic tonsillar hypertrophy (HBI) may affect a 
child's quality of life and sleep. Several studies have sought to relate the 
clinical features of HBI with the infectious and/or immunologic changes that 
occur.
OBJECTIVE:  To increase the knowledge of the etiology of HBI.
DATA SYNTHESIS:  From 2012 to 2013 we conducted a retrospective observational 
study of 101 children with HBI who underwent tonsillectomies at Ambulatory ENT 
General Hospital of the East Zone of São Paulo City, a region with a poor 
socioeconomic population. Preoperative serologic results were available to 
confirm mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) and 
immunoglobulins. The mean patient age was 5.8 years (55% male, 45% female). 
Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we identified significant gender differences in 
the parameters of immunoglobulins (Ig) M (IgM), IgA, and IgE. Forty-seven 
percent of the patients had increased ASLO levels, and 37% had increased IgE 
levels.
CONCLUSION:  An evaluation of a patient's serologic parameters and laboratory 
results may be relevant to the etiology and prevention of HBI. Based on the 
results obtained from the study sample, the identification of etiologic agents 
and causative factors remain a public health challenge that affects the quality 
of life of children.

Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Spine is the most common site for skeletal metastasis in patients with 
malignancy. Vertebral involvement quantification, neurological status, general 
health status and primary tumor histology are factors to set surgical planning 
and therapeutic targets. We evaluated the impact of general clinical and 
neurological status, histologic type and surgery in survival.
METHOD: The study sample consisted of consecutive patients admitted from July 
2010 to January 2013 for treatment.
RESULTS: Sixty eight patients were evaluated. 23 were female and 45 were male. 
Main primary neoplasic sites were: breast, prostate, lung/pleura and 
linfoproliferative. Thirty three out of 68 received surgical treatment, 2 
received percutaneous biopsy and 33 had nonsurgical treatment.
SURVIVAL: Log Rank curves revealed no statistical significant difference 
according to histological type, surgical approach and Frankel Score. Karnofsky 
Score was statistically different.
CONCLUSION: Histological type and clinical status were statistically associated 
with life expectancy in vertebral metastatic disease.

The role of the brain in the somatic development, as well as in the 
establishment of the different variables of the life history pattern in 
vertebrates has been largely debated. Moreover, during the last thirty years, 
dental development has been used as a good proxy to infer different aspects of 
the life history in hominins, primarily due to the correlation that exists 
between age at first molar eruption and brain size in the order Primates. We 
review these questions using what is known about brain growth and maturation, 
dental development and life history pattern, mainly in Homo sapiens and Pan 
troglodytes. It has been assumed that the brain represents the pace-maker of our 
development. However, we consider that our particular phenotype is the result of 
a hierarchical genetic program modulated by epigenetic and environmental 
factors. The particular bauplan of any kind of organisms (e.g. primates) may 
explain the high correlation observed between different variables of its life 
history pattern, brain size or dental development. However, the correlation of 
these variables seems to be less reliable when dealing with low-rank taxonomical 
categories (i.e., species). We suggest that, while there is likely some 
relationship between the rate of somatic development and tooth development, our 
brain size and maturation (and, by extension, those of other species of the 
genus Homo) have derived towards a particular trajectory, with a unique pattern 
of prenatal and postnatal time and rate of growth and, particularly, with 
remarkable slow brain maturation. We suggest that extremely slow brain 
maturation could be a very recent acquisition of the last H. sapiens 
populations. Furthermore, our review of the literature suggests caution in 
drawing conclusions about aspects of the life history of the hominins from the 
information we can obtain from dental development in fossil specimens.

The development of concrete corrosion in new sewer pipes undergoes an initiation 
process before reaching an active corrosion stage. This initiation period is 
assumed to last several months to years but the key factors affecting the 
process, and its duration, are not well understood. This study is therefore 
focused on this initial stage of the corrosion process and the effect of key 
environmental factors. Such knowledge is important for the effective management 
of corrosion in new sewers, as every year of life extension of such systems has 
a very high financial benefit. This long-term (4.5 year) study has been 
conducted in purpose-built corrosion chambers that closely simulated the sewer 
environment, but with control of three key environmental factors being hydrogen 
sulfide (H2S) gas phase concentration, relative humidity and air temperature. 
Fresh concrete coupons, cut from an industry-standard sewer pipe, were exposed 
to the corrosive conditions in the chambers, both in the gas phase and partially 
submerged in wastewater. A total of 36 exposure conditions were investigated to 
determine the controlling factors by regular retrieval of concrete coupons for 
detailed analysis of surface pH, sulfur compounds (elemental sulfur and sulfate) 
and concrete mass loss. Corrosion initiation times were thus determined for 
different exposure conditions. It was found that the corrosion initiation time 
of both gas-phase and partially-submerged coupons was positively correlated with 
the gas phase H2S concentration, but only at levels of 10 ppm or below, 
indicating that sulfide oxidation rate rather than the H2S concentration was the 
limiting factor during the initiation stage. Relative humidity also played a 
role for the corrosion initiation of the gas-phase coupons. However, the 
partially-submerged coupons were not affected by humidity as these coupons were 
in direct contact with the sewage and hence did have sufficient moisture to 
enable the microbial processes to proceed. The corrosion initiation time was 
also shortened by higher gas temperature due to its positive impact on reaction 
kinetics. These findings provide real opportunities for pro-active sewer asset 
management with the aim to delay the on-set of the corrosion processes, and 
hence extend the service life of sewers, through improved prediction and 
optimization capacity.

Improvements in life expectancy have been considerable over the past hundred 
years. Forecasters have taken to applying historical trends under an assumption 
of continuing improvements in life expectancy in the future. A linear mixed 
effects model was used to estimate the trends in global and regional rates of 
improvements in life expectancy, child, adult, and senior survival, in 166 
countries between 1950 and 2010. Global improvements in life expectancy, 
including both child and adult survival rates, decelerated significantly over 
the study period. Overall life expectancy gains were estimated to have declined 
from 5.9 to 4.0 months per year for a mean deceleration of -0.07 months/year2; 
annual child survival gains declined from 4.4 to 1.6 deaths averted per 1000 for 
a mean deceleration of -0.06 deaths/1000/year2; adult survival gains were 
estimated to decline from 4.8 to 3.7 deaths averted per 1000 per year for a mean 
deceleration of -0.08 deaths/1000/year2. Senior survival gains however increased 
from 2.4 to 4.2 deaths averted per 1000 per year for an acceleration of 0.03 
deaths/1000/year2. Regional variation in the four measures was substantial. The 
rates of global improvements in life expectancy, child survival, and adult 
survival have declined since 1950 despite an increase in the rate of 
improvements among seniors. We postulate that low-cost innovation, related to 
the last half-century progress in health-primarily devoted to children and 
middle age, is reaping diminishing returns on its investments. Trends are uneven 
across regions and measures, which may be due in part to the state of 
epidemiological transition between countries and regions and disparities in the 
diffusion of innovation, accessible only in high-income countries where life 
expectancy is already highest.

BACKGROUND: For the treatment of depressive disorders, the framework of 
collaborative care has been recommended, which showed improved outcomes in the 
primary care sector. Yet, an earlier literature review did not find sufficient 
evidence to draw robust conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of collaborative 
care.
PURPOSE: To systematically review studies on the cost-effectiveness of 
collaborative care, compared with usual care for the treatment of patients with 
depressive disorders in primary care.
METHODS: A systematic literature search in major databases was conducted. Risk 
of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Methodological 
quality of the articles was assessed using the Consensus on Health Economic 
Criteria (CHEC) list. To ensure comparability across studies, cost data were 
inflated to the year 2012 using country-specific gross domestic product 
inflation rates, and were adjusted to international dollars using purchasing 
power parities (PPP).
RESULTS: In total, 19 cost-effectiveness analyses were reviewed. The included 
studies had sample sizes between n = 65 to n = 1,801, and time horizons between 
six to 24 months. Between 42% and 89% of the CHEC quality criteria were 
fulfilled, and in only one study no risk of bias was identified. A societal 
perspective was used by five studies. Incremental costs per depression-free day 
ranged from dominance to US$PPP 64.89, and incremental costs per QALY from 
dominance to US$PPP 874,562.
CONCLUSION: Despite our review improved the comparability of study results, 
cost-effectiveness of collaborative care compared with usual care for the 
treatment of patients with depressive disorders in primary care is ambiguous 
depending on willingness to pay. A still considerable uncertainty, due to 
inconsistent methodological quality and results among included studies, suggests 
further cost-effectiveness analyses using QALYs as effect measures and a time 
horizon of at least 1 year.

Management of older women with early-stage breast cancer.

Breast cancer is a disease of aging. The average age at diagnosis is 61, and the 
majority of deaths occur after age 65. Caring for older women with breast cancer 
is a major challenge, as many have coexisting illness that can preclude optimal 
breast cancer treatment and which frequently have greater effect than the breast 
cancer itself. Older patients with cancer should be screened or have a brief 
geriatric assessment to detect potentially remediable problems not usually 
assessed by oncologists (e.g., self-care, falls, social support, nutrition). 
Older women with early-stage breast cancer should be treated initially with 
surgery unless they have an exceedingly short life expectancy. Primary endocrine 
therapy should be considered for patients who have hormone receptor-positive 
tumors and a very short life expectancy, an acute illness that delays surgery, 
or tumors that need to be downstaged to be resectable. Sentinel node biopsy 
should be considered for patients in whom it might affect treatment decisions. 
Breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery may be omitted for selected 
older women, especially for those with hormone receptor-positive early-stage 
breast cancer that are compliant with adjuvant endocrine therapy. The majority 
of older women with stage I and II breast cancer have hormone receptor-positive, 
HER2-negative tumors, and endocrine therapy provides them with optimal systemic 
treatment. If these patients have life expectancies exceeding at least 5 years, 
they should be considered for genetic assays to determine the potential value of 
chemotherapy. Partnering care with geriatricians or primary care physicians 
trained in geriatrics should be considered for all vulnerable and frail older 
patients.

PURPOSE: Proton beam therapy is a commonly accepted treatment for intraocular 
melanomas, but the literature is lacking in descriptions of patient preferences 
of clinical outcomes and economic impact. In addition, no economic evaluations 
have been published regarding the incremental cost-effectiveness of proton beam 
therapy compared with enucleation or plaque brachytherapy, typical alternative 
treatments. We, therefore, conducted a cost-utility analysis of these three 
approaches for the treatment of intraocular melanomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed. Model parameters were 
identified from the published literature and publicly available data sources. 
Cost-effectiveness of each treatment was calculated in 2011 US Dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
calculated assuming enucleation as reference. One-way sensitivity analyses were 
conducted on all model parameters. A decision threshold of 
$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year was used to determine cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Enucleation had the lowest costs and quality-adjusted life-years, and 
plaque brachytherapy had the highest costs and quality-adjusted life-years. 
Compared with enucleation, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
for plaque brachytherapy and proton beam therapy were $77,500/quality-adjusted 
life-year and $106,100/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. Results were 
highly sensitive to multiple parameters. All three treatments were considered 
optimal, and even dominant, depending on the values used for sensitive 
parameters.
CONCLUSION: Base-case analysis results suggest enucleation to be optimal. 
However, the optimal choice was not robust to sensitivity analyses and, 
depending on the assumption, both plaque brachytherapy and proton beam therapy 
could be considered cost-effective. Future clinical studies should focus on 
generating further evidence with the greatest parameter uncertainty to inform 
future cost-effectiveness analyses.

A Novel Method for Quantifying Smooth Regional Variations in Myocardial 
Contractility Within an Infarcted Human Left Ventricle Based on Delay-Enhanced 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Heart failure is increasing at an alarming rate, making it a worldwide epidemic. 
As the population ages and life expectancy increases, this trend is not likely 
to change. Myocardial infarction (MI)-induced adverse left ventricular (LV) 
remodeling is responsible for nearly 70% of heart failure cases. The adverse 
remodeling process involves an extension of the border zone (BZ) adjacent to an 
MI, which is normally perfused but shows myofiber contractile dysfunction. To 
improve patient-specific modeling of cardiac mechanics, we sought to create a 
finite element model of the human LV with BZ and MI morphologies integrated 
directly from delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance (DE-MR) images. Instead of 
separating the LV into discrete regions (e.g., the MI, BZ, and remote regions) 
with each having a homogeneous myocardial material property, we assumed a 
functional relation between the DE-MR image pixel intensity and myocardial 
stiffness and contractility--we considered a linear variation of material 
properties as a function of DE-MR image pixel intensity, which is known to 
improve the accuracy of the model's response. The finite element model was then 
calibrated using measurements obtained from the same patient--namely, 3D strain 
measurements-using complementary spatial modulation of magnetization magnetic 
resonance (CSPAMM-MR) images. This led to an average circumferential strain 
error of 8.9% across all American Heart Association (AHA) segments. We 
demonstrate the utility of our method for quantifying smooth regional variations 
in myocardial contractility using cardiac DE-MR and CSPAMM-MR images acquired 
from a 78-yr-old woman who experienced an MI approximately 1 yr prior. We found 
a remote myocardial diastolic stiffness of C(0) = 0.102 kPa, and a remote 
myocardial contractility of T(max) = 146.9 kPa, which are both in the range of 
previously published normal human values. Moreover, we found a normalized pixel 
intensity range of 30% for the BZ, which is consistent with the literature. 
Based on these regional myocardial material properties, we used our finite 
element model to compute patient-specific diastolic and systolic LV myofiber 
stress distributions, which cannot be measured directly. One of the main driving 
forces for adverse LV remodeling is assumed to be an abnormally high level of 
ventricular wall stress, and many existing and new treatments for heart failure 
fundamentally attempt to normalize LV wall stress. Thus, our noninvasive method 
for estimating smooth regional variations in myocardial contractility should be 
valuable for optimizing new surgical or medical strategies to limit the chronic 
evolution from infarction to heart failure.

INTRODUCTION: The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important 
role in the pathogenesis of different diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis
