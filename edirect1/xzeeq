BACKGROUND: The disease burden of pancreatic cancer in East Asia is at a high 
level, but the epidemiological characteristics of pancreatic cancer in the 
region have not been systematically studied.
METHOD: Joinpoint analysis was used to identify average annual percentage change 
(AAPC) and annual percentage change (APC) in mortality. Age-period-cohort models 
were used to analyze age-period cohort effects across countries. Bayesian 
age-period-cohort (BAPC) analysis was used to project the burden of disease for 
2020-2030.
RESULTS: Pancreatic cancer mortality in males in Japan (2012-2019, APC = -0.97) 
and Korea (2012-2019, APC = -0.91) has shown a decreasing trend since 2012 (P < 
.05). However, China (2016-2019, APC = 3.21), Mongolia (2015-2.019, APC = 2.37), 
and North Korea (2012-2019, APC = 0.47) showed a significant increase in 
pancreatic cancer in both genders (P < .05). Risk factors for pancreatic cancer 
in East Asia remained largely stable between 2010 and 2019. Mortality of 
pancreatic cancer due to smoking began to decline in areas with high 
socio-demographic index (SDI), and mortality of pancreatic cancer due to high 
body mass index and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. The 
age-standardized mortality for pancreatic cancer in Chinese males is expected to 
exceed that of Japan and South Korea by 2030, but the disease burden of 
pancreatic cancer in Japan and South Korea remains at extremely high levels.
CONCLUSION: Economically developed countries are beginning to show a decreasing 
trend in the burden of pancreatic cancer disease, and developing countries are 
experiencing a rapid increase in the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of 
pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a highly prevalent disease, one of the chronic diseases 
with the highest economic costs; thus, it imposes a high economic burden on 
society, the healthcare system, patients, and third-party payers. Contrary to 
this study, until now, systematic reviews of economic evaluations (EEs) of 
treatments for severe asthma have not been exclusively focused on biological 
treatments, and have included a small number of studies and only model-based 
EEs.
METHODS: This study systematically reviews EEs of biological therapies for 
severe asthma published until December 2022 using PRISMA guidelines. The review 
analyzes the cost-effectiveness of biologicals in comparison to SOC, or SOC plus 
OCS. The quality of the EEs is assessed using Consensus on Health Economics 
Checklist extended (CHEC-extended).
RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies were eligible: 15 based on a Markov model, and 19 
trial-based; eight adopting societal and NHS perspectives, and seven the payer's 
perspective. The reviewed EEs addressed cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and 
incremental costs and outcomes comparison. Their findings were mainly expressed 
through ICER-incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (24 studies: 13 concluded that 
biological were cost-effective) and cost comparison analysis (14 studies: 6 
concluded that biological were cost-effective), and were sensitive to a wide 
variety of factors (e.g. medication cost, treatment response, time horizon, 
utility benefits, mortality, exacerbation rate, discount rate, etc.).
CONCLUSIONS: There has been some ambiguity concerning the EE of biological 
therapies due to variation in choice of study design and contradictory results. 
Nevertheless, it can be concluded that biological treatments improve health 
outcomes, in many contexts at a high cost.

Insect CAPA-PVK (periviscerokinin) and pyrokinin (PK) neuropeptides belong to 
the PRX family peptides and are produced from capa and pyrokinin genes. We 
identified and characterised the two genes from the western flower thrips, 
Frankliniella occidentalis. The capa gene transcribes three splice variants, 
capa-a, -b, and -c, encoding two CAPA-PVKs (EVQGLFPFPRVamide; QGLIPFPRVamide) 
and two PKs (ASWMPSSSPRLamide; DSASFTPRLamide). The pyrokinin mRNA encodes three 
PKs: DLVTQVLQPGQTGMWFGPRLamide, SEGNLVNFTPRLamide, and 
ESGEQPEDLEGSMGGAATSRQLRTDSEPTWGFSPRLamide, the most extended pheromone 
biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) ortholog in insects. Multiple 
potential endoproteolytic cleavage sites were presented in the prepropeptides 
from the pyrokinin gene, creating ambiguity to predict mature peptides. To solve 
this difficulty, we used three G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for CAPA-PVK, 
tryptophan PK (trpPK), and PK peptides, and evaluated the binding affinities of 
the peptides. The binding activities revealed each subfamily of peptides 
exclusively bind to their corresponding receptors, and were significant for 
determining the CAPA-PVK and PK peptides. Our biological method using specific 
GPCRs would be a valuable tool for determining mature peptides, particularly 
with multiple and ambiguous cleavage sites in those prepropeptides. Both capa 
and pyrokinin mRNAs were strongly expressed in the head/thorax, but minimally 
expressed in the abdomen. The two genes also were clearly expressed during most 
of the life stages. Whole-mounting immunocytochemistry revealed that neurons 
contained PRXamide peptides throughout the whole-body: four to six 
neurosecretory cells in the head, and three and seven pairs of immunostained 
cells in the thorax and abdomen, respectively. Notably, the unusual PRXamide 
profiles of Thysanoptera are different from the other insect groups.

Social Accountability and Legal Empowerment Initiatives: Improving the Health of 
Underserved Roma Communities in Eastern Europe.

Improving the protection of the right to health of ethnic Roma people is one of 
the most pressing public health challenges in contemporary Europe, as their life 
expectancy and health status remain significantly lower than their non-Roma 
counterparts.1 This paper analyzes Roma-led accountability initiatives that 
embrace social accountability and legal empowerment approaches to advocate for 
equitable fulfillment of the right to health. While these initiatives have led 
to the elimination of some harmful health practices (such as illegal cash bribes 
and violent and abusive treatment by medical professionals) and to improvements 
in health care, and some Roma communities have become driving forces for local 
and national health system reforms for advancing the fulfillment of health 
rights, the health inequalities affecting Roma communities remain significant. 
This issue also remains largely overlooked by European health research and 
policy experts, who are mostly reluctant to incorporate analyses of ethnicity 
and racialization into their research on health inequalities in Europe. The 
COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these health inequalities.

As biological sequence databases continue growing, so do the insight that they 
promise to shed on the shape of the genetic diversity of life. However, to 
fulfil this promise the software must remain usable, be able to accommodate a 
large amount of data and allow use of modern high performance computing 
infrastructure. In this study we present a reimplementation as well as an 
extension of a technique using indicator vectors to compute and visualize 
similarities between sets of nucleotide sequences. We have a flexible and easy 
to use python program relying on standard and open-source libraries. Our tool 
allows analysis of very large complement of sequences using code 
parallelization, as well as by providing routines to split a computational task 
in smaller and manageable subtasks whose results are then merged. This 
implementation also facilitates adding new sequences into an indicator 
vector-based representation without re-computing the whole set. The efficient 
synthesis of data into knowledge is no trivial matter given the size and rapid 
growth of biological sequence databases. Based on previous results regarding the 
properties of indicator vectors, the open-source approach proposed here 
efficiently and flexibly supports comparative analysis of genetic diversity at a 
large scale. Our software is freely available at:

The growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and an increase in the 
prevalence of the underlying risk factors are creating a challenge to health 
systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Nepal, deaths 
attributable to NCDs have been increasing, as has life expectancy. This poses 
questions with regards to how age and various risk factors interact in affecting 
NCDs. We analyzed the effects of age on NCD risk factors, using data from the 
Nepalese STEPs survey 2019, a nationally representative cross-sectional study. 
Six sociodemographic determinants, four behavioral risk factors, and four 
biological risk factors were examined. Age effects were analyzed among three age 
groups: below 35 years (young), 35-59 years (middle aged) and 60 years and above 
(elderly). The prevalence of selected behavioral risk factors for NCDs, notably 
smoking, alcohol consumption and insufficient physical activity, and some 
biological risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) increases with age. The 
prevalence of most behavioral risk factors was highest among men and women aged 
60 years and above. The prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia was 
highest among the elderly, but the prevalence of diabetes and overweight/obesity 
was highest among the middle aged for both sexes. Age interactions in the 
association between behaviors and biological risk factors were surprisingly 
weak. However, age interactions were significant in the association between 
alcohol consumption and -hypertension, -overweight/obesity and -hyperlipidemia 
among women. While the prevalence of NCD risk factors tends to be higher among 
elders, the interaction between age and risk factors is complex. Most NCD risk 
factors are related to behaviors, which originate in young adulthood. It is 
necessary to diagnose and treat biological risk factors, in younger age groups 
before they manifest as NCDs. Similarly, behavior change interventions need to 
target these younger age groups to reduce the risk of NCDs later in life.

A new method for estimating growth and fertility rates using age-at-death ratios 
in small skeletal samples: The effect of mortality and stochastic variation.

Republic.

The common procedure for reconstructing growth and fertility rates from skeletal 
samples involves regressing a growth or fertility rate on the age-at-death 
ratio, an indicator that captures the proportion of children and juveniles in a 
skeletal sample. Current methods derive formulae for predicting growth and 
fertility rates in skeletal samples from modern reference populations with many 
deaths, although recent levels of mortality are not good proxies for prehistoric 
populations, and stochastic error may considerably affect the age distributions 
of deaths in small skeletal samples. This study addresses these issues and 
proposes a novel algorithm allowing a customized prediction formula to be 
produced for each target skeletal sample, which increases the accuracy of growth 
and fertility rate estimation. Every prediction equation is derived from a 
unique reference set of simulated skeletal samples that match the target 
skeletal sample in size and assumed mortality level of the population that the 
target skeletal sample represents. The mortality regimes of reference 
populations are based on model life tables in which life expectancy can be 
flexibly set between 18 and 80 years. Regression models provide a reliable 
prediction; the models explain 83-95% of total variance. Due to stochastic 
variation, the prediction error is large when the estimate is based on a small 
number of skeletons but decreases substantially with increasing sample size. The 
applicability of our approach is demonstrated by a comparison with baseline 
estimates, defined here as predictions based on the widely used Bocquet-Appel 
(2002, doi: 10.1086/342429) equation.

CONTEXT: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex disorder combining 
hypothalamic dysfunction, neurodevelopmental delay, hypotonia, and hyperphagia 
with risk of obesity and its complications. PWS is caused by the loss of 
expression of the PWS critical region, a cluster of paternally expressed genes 
on chromosome 15q11.2-q13. As life expectancy of patients with PWS increases, 
age-related diseases like malignancies might pose a new threat to health.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of malignancies in 
patients with PWS and to provide clinical recommendations for cancer screening.
METHODS: We included 706 patients with PWS (160 children, 546 adults). We 
retrospectively collected data from medical records on past or current 
malignancies, the type of malignancy, and risk factors for malignancy. 
Additionally, we searched the literature for information about the relationship 
between genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13 and malignancies.
RESULTS: Seven adults (age range, 18-55 years) had been diagnosed with a 
malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, intracranial hemangiopericytoma, 
melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, biliary cancer, parotid adenocarcinoma, and 
colon cancer). All patients with a malignancy had a paternal 15q11-13 deletion. 
The literature review showed that several genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13 are 
related to malignancies.
CONCLUSION: Malignancies are rare in patients with PWS. Therefore, screening for 
malignancies is only indicated when clinically relevant symptoms are present, 
such as unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, symptoms suggestive of 
paraneoplastic syndrome, or localizing symptoms. Given the increased cancer risk 
associated with obesity, which is common in PWS, participation in national 
screening programs should be encouraged.

BACKGROUND: Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has a relatively short shelf life as a 
result of rapid ripening, limiting its transportability and marketability. 
Recently, gamma irradiation has emerged as a viable method for delaying tomato 
fruit ripening. Although few studies have shown that gamma irradiation delays 
the ripening of tomatoes, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Therefore, 
the present study aimed to examine the effects of gamma irradiation on tomato 
fruit ripening and the underlying mechanisms using transcriptomics.
RESULTS: Following gamma irradiation, the total microbial count, weight loss, 
and decay rate of tomatoes significantly reduced during storage. Furthermore, 
the redness (a*), color change (∆E), and lycopene content of gamma-irradiated 
tomatoes decreased in a dose-dependent manner during storage. Moreover, gamma 
irradiation significantly upregulated the expression levels of genes associated 
with DNA, chloroplast, and oxidative damage repairs, whereas those of ethylene 
and auxin signaling-, ripening-, and cell wall metabolism-related, as well as 
carotenoid genes, were downregulated.
CONCLUSION: Gamma irradiation effectively delayed ripening by downregulating the 
expression of ripening-related genes and inhibiting microbial growth, which 
prevented decay and prolonged the shelf life of tomatoes. © 2023 The Authors.

Does EQ-5D Tell the Whole Story? Statistical Methods for Comparing the Thematic 
Coverage of Clinical and Generic Outcome Measures, With Application to Breast 
Cancer.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop the following: (1) methods for assessing 
claims in any specific application that a generic outcome measure, such as EQ-5D 
is deficient in its coverage of 1 or more specified domains, and (2) a simple 
method of judging whether any such deficiency is likely to be quantitatively 
important enough to call into question evaluations based on the generic 
instrument. Also to demonstrate the applicability of the methods in the 
important area of breast cancer.
METHODS: The methodology requires a data set with observations from a generic 
instrument (eg, EQ-5D) and also a more comprehensive clinical instrument (eg, 
FACT-B [Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast]). A standardized 
3-component statistical analysis is proposed for investigating the claim that 
the generic measure inadequately captures some specified dimension covered by 
the latter instrument. A theoretically based upper bound on the bias induced by 
deficient coverage is derived based on the assumption that the designers of the 
(k-dimensional) generic instrument did succeed in identifying the k most 
important domains.
RESULTS: Data from the MARIANNE breast cancer trial were analyzed and results 
suggested that impacts on personal appearance and relationships may be 
inadequately represented by EQ-5D. Nevertheless, the indications are that the 
bias in quality-adjusted life-year differences from deficient coverage by EQ-5D 
is likely to be modest.
CONCLUSIONS: The methodology offers a systematic approach to determining whether 
there is clear evidence consistent with any claim that a generic outcome measure 
such as EQ-5D misses an important specific domain. The approach is readily 
implementable using data sets that are available in many randomized controlled 
trials.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: The burden of schizophrenia is increasing. Assessing 
the global distribution of schizophrenia and understanding the association 
between urbanization factors and schizophrenia are crucial.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a two-stage analysis utilizing public data from GBD 
(global burden of disease) 2019 and the World Bank. First, the distribution of 
schizophrenia burden at the global, regional, and national levels as well as 
temporal trends was analyzed. Then, four composite indicators of urbanization 
(including demographic, spatial, economic, and eco-environment urbanization) 
were constructed from ten basic indicators. Panel data models were used to 
explore the relationship between urbanization indicators and the burden of 
schizophrenia.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 23.6 million people with schizophrenia, an increase 
of 65.85% from 1990, and the country with the largest ASDR (age-standardized 
disability adjusted life years rate) was the United States of America, followed 
by Australia, and New Zealand. Globally, the ASDR of schizophrenia rose with the 
sociodemographic index (SDI). In addition, six basic urbanization indicators 
including urban population proportion, employment in industry/services 
proportion, urban population density, the population proportion in the largest 
city, GDP, and PM2.5 concentration were positively associated with ASDR of 
schizophrenia, with the largest coefficients being urban population density. 
Overall, demographic, spatial, economic, and eco-environment urbanization all 
had positive effects on schizophrenia, and the estimated coefficients indicated 
that demographic urbanization was the most significant influence.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a comprehensive description of the global 
burden of schizophrenia and explored urbanization as a factor contributing to 
the variation in the burden of schizophrenia, and highlighted policy priorities 
for schizophrenia prevention in the context of urbanization.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives were (1) to establish the strength of the association 
between incident cases of osteoarthritis (OA) and low back pain (LBP), and 
physical activity (PA) and to assess the likelihood of the associations being 
causal; and (2) to quantify the impact of PA on the burden of OA and LBP in 
Australia.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review in EMBASE and PubMed 
databases from January 01, 2000, to April 28, 2020. We used the Bradford Hill 
viewpoints to assess causality. We used a proportional multistate life table 
model to estimate the impact of changes in the PA levels on OA and LBP burdens 
for the 2019 Australian population (aged ≥ 20 y) over their remaining lifetime.
RESULTS: We found that both OA and LBP are possibly causally related to physical 
inactivity. Assuming causality, our model projected that if the 2025 World 
Health Organization global target for PA was met, the burden in 25 years' time 
could be reduced by 70,000 prevalent cases of OA and over 11,000 cases of LBP. 
Over the lifetime of the current adult population of Australia, the gains could 
add up to approximately 672,814 health-adjusted life years (HALYs) for OA 
(ie, 27 HALYs per 1000 persons) and 114,042 HALYs for LBP (ie, 5 HALYs per 1000 
persons). The HALY gains would be 1.4 times bigger if the 2030 World Health 
Organization global target for PA was achieved and 11 times bigger if all 
Australians adhered to the Australian PA guidelines.
CONCLUSION: This study provides empirical support for the adoption of PA in 
strategies for the prevention of OA and back pain.

To analyze growth patterns of children with CP between countries; to examine 
differences in growth; and to assess the fit of growth charts. Cross-sectional 
study in children with CP from 2 to 19 years old, 399 from Argentina and 400 
from Germany. Growth measures were converted into z-scores and compared to WHO 
reference and US CP growth charts. Generalized Linear Model was used to analyze 
the growth expressed as mean z-scores. 799 children. Mean age 9 years (± 4). 
Compared to the WHO reference, the decrease in Height z-scores (HAZ) with age in 
Argentina (- 0.144/year) was double that in Germany (- 0.073/year). For children 
in GMFCS IV-V, BMI z-scores (BMIZ) decreased with age (- 0.102/year). Using the 
US CP charts, both countries showed decreasing HAZ with age, in Argentina 
(- 0.066/year) and in Germany (- 0.032/year). BMIZ increased more among children 
with feeding tubes (0.062/year), similar in both countries. Argentinian children 
with oral feeding decrease their Weight z-score (WAZ) by - 0.553 compared to 
their peers. With WHO charts BMIZ presented an excellent fit for GMFCS I-III. 
HAZ presents a poor fit to growth references. BMIZ and WAZ presented a good fit 
to US CP Charts. Growth differences due to ethnicity also act in children with 
CP, and are related to motor impairment, age and feeding modality, possibly 
reflecting differences in environment or health care.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) considered as one of the most common 
degenerative diseases of synovial joint. KOA is mostly managed by physical 
therapy, focused on pain management, the range of motion and muscle 
strengthening but muscle flexibility is usually neglected. A study was conducted 
to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic soft tissue mobilization (DSTM) in 
comparison with the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching 
in the management of hamstring tightness, reduction of pain intensity and 
improvement of physical functionality in KOA.
METHODS: Forty eight patients with KOA were randomly allocated to group A 
receiving DTSM and group B receiving PNF stretching. The cryotherapy and 
isometric strengthening exercises were also given to both groups. Total 
treatment duration consisted of 4 weeks, 3 sessions per week and total 12 
sessions per patient. Each treatment session comprised of 30 min. At baseline 
and post treatment, Active knee extension test(AKET), Visual analogue scale 
(VAS), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to 
assess hamstring flexibility, pain intensity level and physical functional 
capability respectively. The continuous variables were shown as mean and 
standard deviations. For the comparison of outcome within and between groups, 
paired sample and independent t-test was applied. Considerable p value was less 
than 0.05.
RESULTS: The between group analysis of VAS, right AKE test, and left AKE test 
showed non-significant (p > 0.05) mean difference as 0.2 (95% CI= -0.29, 0.70), 
1.79 (95% CI= -1.84, 4.59), 1.78 (95% CI= -1.6, 5.19) respectively. KOOS domains 
of symptom, pain, ADLs, sports and recreational, and quality of life had also 
non-significant (p > 0.05) mean difference as 1.12 (95% CI= -4.05, 6.3), -5.12 
(95% CI= -12.71, 2.46), -2.55 (95% CI= -7.47, 2.38), -2.7 (95% CI= -9.72, 4.3), 
and - 0.68 (95% CI= -7.69, 6.36) respectively. Significant (p < 0.001) 
improvement was shown in both groups for all outcome measures after 12 sessions.
CONCLUSION: DSTM and PNF stretching, both treatments are equally beneficial in 
KOA for hamstring flexibility, pain reduction and functional mobility in terms 
of AKET, VAS, and KOOS respectively.

Globally, life expectancy is increasing, leading to more surgeries being 
performed in older patients. Postoperative pain is associated with complications 
after surgery. The aim of this study is to explore potential age-related risk 
factors for acute postoperative pain in older patients undergoing surgery. This 
was a prospective, single-center study. Patients ≥65 years, with and without 
disability, as defined by the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, undergoing 
elective surgery, were compared. Primary outcome was the postoperative pain (ie, 
numeric rating scale (NRS) score) on the first postoperative day. Secondary 
outcomes were postoperative pain and pain trajectories in patients with and 
without mild cognitive impairment (MCI), frailty, preoperative opioid use, and 
new-onset disability after surgery. Between February 2019 and July 2020, 155 
patients were enrolled. On the first day after surgery, postoperative pain did 
not differ between patients with and without disability. NRS scores differed 
between patients with-, and without MCI on the first (P = .01), and second 
postoperative day (P < .01). Patients who used opioids before surgery reported 
higher median NRS score on the first (P < .001) and second (P < .01) 
postoperative day. Out of a total of 1816 NRS scores, 2 pain clusters were 
identified. Acute postoperative pain did not differ between patients with or 
without preoperative disability and frailty in older patients undergoing 
surgery. Reduced postoperative pain in older patients with MCI warrants further 
investigation. The PIANO study (Comparison of Postoperative 
NeurocognitiveFunction in Older Adult Patients with and without Diabetes 
Mellitus) was registered with www.clinicaltrialregister.nl (search term: Which 
can predict memory problems after surgery better; blood sugar levels or memory 
before surgery?). PERSPECTIVE: This study explored risk factors for acute 
postoperative pain in older patients. No differences in postoperative pain were 
observed in patients with or without preexistent disability or frailty, however, 
patients with mild cognitive impairment experienced reduced pain. We suggest to 
simplify pain assessment in this group and take functional recovery into 
account.

Autophagy plays a key role in cellular, tissue and organismal homeostasis and in 
the production of the energy load needed at critical times during development 
and in response to nutrient shortage. Autophagy is generally considered as a 
pro-survival mechanism, although its deregulation has been linked to 
non-apoptotic cell death. Autophagy efficiency declines with age, thus 
contributing to many different pathophysiological conditions, such as cancer, 
cardiomyopathy, diabetes, liver disease, autoimmune diseases, infections, and 
neurodegeneration. Accordingly, it has been proposed that the maintenance of a 
proper autophagic activity contributes to the extension of the lifespan in 
different organisms. A better understanding of the interplay between autophagy 
and risk of age-related pathologies is important to propose nutritional and 
life-style habits favouring disease prevention as well as possible clinical 
applications aimed at promoting long-term health.

PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that adding dapagliflozin to the prior standard of 
care is cost-effective compared with the standard of care alone. The latest 
guideline by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart 
Failure Society of America now recommends the use of sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for patients with heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, the relative cost-effectiveness of different 
SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, has not been fully 
characterized. Therefore, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare 
dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF from the US health care 
perspective.
METHODS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in 
treating HFrEF, we used a state-transition Markov model. This model was used to 
estimate the expected lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for both medications. The model 
incorporated patients who were 65 years of age at entry and simulated their 
health outcomes over a lifetime horizon. The perspective of the analysis was 
based on the US health care system. To determine the health state transition 
probabilities, we used a network meta-analysis. All future costs and QALYs were 
discounted at an annual rate of 3%, and the costs were presented in 2022 US 
dollars.
FINDINGS: The base case analysis found that the incremental expected lifetime 
cost of treating patients with dapagliflozin vs empagliflozin was $37,684, 
resulting in an ICER of $44,763 per QALY. A price threshold analysis indicated 
that for empagliflozin to be the most cost-effective SGLT2 inhibitor at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY, it may require a 12% discount 
on its current annual prices.
IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this study indicate that dapagliflozin may offer 
greater lifetime economic value when compared with empagliflozin. Given that the 
current clinical practice guideline does not recommend one SGLT2 inhibitor over 
the other, it is essential to implement scalable strategies to ensure affordable 
access to both medications. By doing so, patients and health care practitioners 
can make informed decisions about their treatment options without being 
constrained by financial barriers.

OBJECTIVES: Life expectancy is increasing around the world, and it has been 
projected that China will have the largest elderly population globally by 2033. 
This study aimed to examine the association of upper limb strength (ULS) and 
lower limb strength (LLS) with all-cause mortality based on data from the 
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (2012-2018).
STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study.
METHODS: Participants were 2442 older adults (aged 84.98 ± 11.94 years) 
recruited from eight regions with a high elderly population in China. Limb 
muscle strength was evaluated using handgrip strength and objective physical 
examinations. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyse the 
association of limb muscle strength with all-cause mortality. Demographic 
characteristics, health status and biological markers were included as 
confounders.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 42.2 months, 993 participants died. 
After adjusting for all covariates, low ULS was associated with a higher 
mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 1.25-1.84), and the association of low LLS with all-cause mortality was 
only significant for men (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.04-1.79). Participants with 
combined low ULS and low LLS had the highest risk of mortality compared with 
participants with normal limb muscle strength (HR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.61-2.63). 
The combined association of ULS and LLS with mortality was robust in subgroup 
and sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Low ULS and low LLS were independently and synergistically
