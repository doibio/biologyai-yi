BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) decreases the life expectancy and quality of 
life of diabetics and causes economic and societal problems. For this purpose, 
diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) has been designed for 
many years, which is recently provided through technology-assisted education. 
Therefore, we developed a web-based program in accordance with DSMES to assess 
its effect on self-care behaviors and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) for patients 
with T2DM during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is described 
in detail in this paper.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed on 
70 diabetic patients in Al-Zahra Hospital for three months. After random 
allocation, web-based educational content (including videos, lectures, 
educational motion graphics, text files, educational posters, and podcasts) 
according to DSMES was provided for the intervention group to improve self-care 
behaviors and HbA1c levels. The control group received routine educational 
pamphlets. A diabetes self-management questionnaire (21 questions) with a Likert 
scale was completed to assess self-care behaviors scores before and after 
intervention and three months later. Also, HbA1c was determined before and after 
the intervention. Analysis of variance with repeated measurements will be 
applied to compare mean scores of self-care behaviors components three times, 
and an independent t-test analyzed mean differences of HbA1c values.
CONCLUSION: The obtained results of this study might be useful for promoting 
self-care behaviors and assessing HbA1c in diabetic patients.

INTRODUCTION: Recently, there has been a steady upward trend in life expectancy, 
so it is extremely important to remember some of the features of the body 
associated specifically with aging. Thus, an important topic for discussion is 
the issue of ensuring the quality of life of an elderly woman. The prevalence of 
urinary incontinence in patients of the older age group leads to significant 
restrictions in their social life. Surgical treatment using general and regional 
anesthesia has significant contraindications due to age and comorbidities. In 
this regard, in some cases, local anesthesia is the method of choice of 
anesthesia in this category of patients.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Evaluation of the possibility of using local anesthesia in 
the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence in geriatric patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the results of surgical treatment of stress 
urinary incontinence in 42 patients. The mean age of the patients was 78+/-4 
years. All patients were treated for urinary incontinence using mini loops under 
local anesthesia. Pre- and postoperative examination included vaginal 
examination in mirrors, cough test, cystoscopy (if indicated), uroflowmetry, 
ultrasound examination of the pelvic organs and bladder, bacterial culture of 
urine with determination of sensitivity to antibiotics. Taking into account the 
advanced age of the patients, the protocol of the preoperative examination 
included the obligatory performance of ultrasound Doppler examination of the 
veins of the lower extremities and echocardiography.
RESULTS: The duration of the operation averaged 22+/-5 minutes. Complications 
requiring a change in the course of the operation were not registered during the 
operation. 1 month after the operation, at the control examination, the cough 
test was negative in 40 (95,2%) patients. 2 (4,8%) had a positive cough test. 
After 6 months, out of 40 (100%) successfully operated patients, 4 (9,52%) had 
urine leakage during the cough test. The maximum follow-up period for patients 
was 12 months. Out of 40 (100%) patients with a negative cough test after 
surgery, it was possible to track the long-term results of treatment only in 33 
(82,5%) patients. After evaluating the results of 33 (100%) operated patients 
after 12 months, it was found that in 30 (90,9%) patients the symptoms of 
urinary incontinence were completely absent, in 3 (9,09%) there was a recurrence 
of urinary incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence using a synthetic 
loop under local anesthesia is effective and safe in geriatric patients.

NC 27834, USA.

Vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease (SCD) leads to a myriad of manifestations 
driving morbidity and mortality in patients with SCD. Increased leucocyte 
adhesion and P-selectin expression on platelets and endothelial cells is an 
inciting event that leads to obstruction of microcirculation by adhesion with 
rigid sickled red blood cells. Crizanlizumab is a first-in-class monoclonal 
antibody that inhibits P-selectin and has been shown to decrease the frequency 
of vaso-occlusive pain crises in patients with SCD in clinical trials. The role 
of crizanlizumab in other manifestations of SCD still needs further 
investigation.

Plain Language Summary: There are more than 100,000 people in the USA living 
with sickle cell anemia, which is a form of the inherited blood disorder, sickle 
cell disease. Patients with sickle cell anemia are typically diagnosed through 
newborn screening programs. They are also diagnosed during times of 
vaso-occlusive pain crisis, where patients present with severe pain without an 
obvious cause, and also through hemolytic anemia, a disorder in which red blood 
cells are destroyed faster than they can be made. While children typically 
survive into adulthood, the life expectancy of those with sickle cell remains 
shorter secondary to the after-effects of chronic sickling, where the hemoglobin 
inside red blood cells sticks or clumps together, causing the cell to become 
fragile. The associated complications of chronic sickling include pulmonary 
hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lung and the right side 
of the heart), heart failure, stroke, liver dysfunction and splenic infarction, 
where the blood flow to the spleen is compromised. Crizanlizumab is a new 
therapy targeting P-selectin, a protein that blocks interaction with p-selectin 
glycoprotein ligand, and has shown promise in reducing vaso-occlusive crises.

Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their 
end-of-life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest 
challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. 
Multi-block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling 
of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by 
difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this 
contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with 
tunable microstructures, which were then used as compatibilizer additives to 
upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi-block+ strategy 
based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which 
enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, 
leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing 
capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic 
blends. The polymer multi-block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis 
and the multi-block+ strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting 
opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Laser-assisted in situ keratomileuses (LASIK) refractive 
surgery is a cutting-edge and developing area of ophthalmology. Reshaping the 
cornea during refractive surgery helps patients become less dependent on glasses 
or contact lenses. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the visual 
outcome, quality of life, and patient satisfaction following LASIK surgery at a 
tertiary care center in North India using the National Eye Institute Refractive 
Error Quality of Life (NEIRQL-42) questionnaire.
METHODS: NEI-RQL, a 42-item measure with 13 subscales. The questionnaire was 
administered to a sample size of 71 patients who underwent LASIK Surgery at a 
tertiary center in North India. Data were collected pre- and post-surgery (1,3,6 
month post-LASIK) for myopic or hyperopic refractive error. Statistical analysis 
was done using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: In myopic patients, the mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was 
-4.19 ± 2.28D in the right eye and -4.26 ± 2.28D in the left eye and post-op SE 
-0.06±0.29 (p=0.00). The largest improvements (>25 points) on the 0 to 100 
possible score range, were seen in activity limitations, dependence on 
correction, appearance, and satisfaction with correction subscales. The subscale 
glare showed a statistically significant difference (worsening) whereas a 
non-significant change (P> 0.05) was recorded only in the sub-optimal correction 
sub-scale.
CONCLUSIONS: The NEIRQL-42 is a responsive tool to evaluate vision-related 
changes in quality of life after LASIK surgery in the Indian population. The 
best surgical expectancy and QoL can be expected at 6 months following surgery.

Sexual reproduction is the primary driving force behind eukaryotic environmental 
adaptation and evolution. In the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, 
sexual reproduction plays a critical role in the emergence of highly virulent 
strains and drug-resistant variants. The sexual life cycle of C. neoformans 
commences with the yeast-hyphae transition in response to mating stimulation, 
followed by hyphal extension and further differentiation into basidium, where 
meiosis takes place to produce basidiospore. Although extensive studies have 
been conducted on the determining factors and genetic pathways involved in the 
sexual cycle, the precise contribution of epigenetic modifications in this 
process remains elusive. Here, through a systematic genetic screening assay, we 
find that Gcn5 is the specific histone acetyltransferase involved in 
yeast-hyphae morphogenesis in C. neoformans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
Gcn5 is indispensable for completing the entire sexual cycle of C. neoformans, 
including yeast-hyphae transition, hyphal development, basidium differentiation, 
meiosis, and subsequent sporulation. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation 
assay demonstrates that Gcn5-mediated H3K14ac modification is closely associated 
with the activated transcription of master transcriptional regulator gene ZNF2 
and its downstream targets under mating-inducing condition. Moreover, disruption 
of two additional subunits encoding gene within the SAGA complex, ADA3 and 
SPT20, resulted in a similar phenotype to that observed with GCN5 deletion, 
indicating that Gcn5 functions in the context of an intact SAGA/ADA complex in 
regulating the sexual life cycle. Taken together, these results elucidated a key 
epigenetic modification, Gcn5-mediated histone acetylation, in orchestrating 
yeast-hyphae morphogenesis and sexual reproduction in the human fungal pathogen 
C. neoformans. IMPORTANCE Eukaryotic gene transcription is typically regulated 
by a series of histone modifications, which play a crucial role in adapting to 
complex environmental stresses. In the ubiquitous human fungal pathogen 
Cryptococcus neoformans, sexual life cycle is a continuous intracellular 
differentiation process that strictly occurs in response to mating stimulation. 
Despite the comprehensive identification of the regulatory factors and genetic 
pathways involved in its sexual cycle, understanding of the epigenetic 
modifications involved in this process remains quite limited. In this research, 
we found that histone acetyltransferase Gcn5-mediated histone H3 acetylation 
plays a crucial role in completing the cryptococcal sexual cycle, including 
yeast-hyphae morphogenesis and the subsequent sexual reproduction. Furthermore, 
we demonstrated that Gcn5 participates in this process primarily through 
regulating the key morphogenesis regulator Znf2 and its targets. This study thus 
provided a comprehensive understanding of how histone acetylation modification 
impacts sexual life cycle in a high-risk human pathogenic fungus.

University, Saitama City, Saitama, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Elongation of the spinal cord is dependent on neural development 
from neuromesodermal progenitors in the tail bud. We previously showed the 
involvement of the Oct4-type gene, pou5f3, in this process in zebrafish mainly 
by dominant-interference gene induction, but, to compensate for the limitation 
of this transgene approach, mutant analysis was indispensable. pou5f3 
involvement in the signaling pathways was another unsolved question.
RESULTS: We examined the phenotypes of pou5f3 mutants and the effects of Pou5f3 
activation by the tamoxifen-ERT2 system in the posterior neural tube, together 
confirming the involvement of pou5f3. The reporter assays using P19 cells 
implicated tail bud-related transcription factors in pou5f3 expression. 
Regulation of tail bud development by retinoic acid (RA) signaling was confirmed 
by treatment of embryos with RA and the synthesis inhibitor, and in vitro 
reporter assays further showed that RA signaling regulated pou5f3 expression. 
Importantly, the expression of the RA degradation enzyme gene, cyp26a1, was 
down-regulated in embryos with disrupted pou5f3 activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The involvement of pou5f3 in spinal cord extension was supported by 
using mutants and the gain-of-function approach. Our findings further suggest 
that pou5f3 regulates the RA level, contributing to neurogenesis in the 
posterior neural tube.

BACKGROUND: Endoprosthesis infections represent a major challenge for doctors 
and patients. Due to the increase in endoprosthesis implantation because of the 
increasing life expectancy, an increase in endoprosthesis infections is to be 
expected. In addition to infection prophylaxis, methods of infection control 
become highly relevant, especially in the group of geriatric and multimorbid 
patients. The aim is to reduce the high 1‑year mortality from prosthesis 
infections through a structured algorithm.
ALGORITHM FOR PROSTHESIS INFECTIONS: Prosthesis infections can basically be 
divided into early and late infections. According to the criteria of the 
International Consensus Meeting, a late infection is defined as the occurrence 
more than 30 days after implantation. With respect to the planned approach, the 
(p)TNM classification offers an orientation. In the early postoperative interval 
the clinical appearance is crucial as in this phase neither laboratory 
parameters nor an analysis of synovial fluid show a high sensitivity. It is 
fundamental that, apart from patients with sepsis, environment diagnostics 
should be initiated. If a late infection is suspected, in addition to 
radiological diagnostics (X-ray, skeletal scintigraphy and if necessary, 
computed tomography, CT), laboratory (C-reactive protein, CRP, leukocytes, blood 
sedimentation, and if necessary, interleukin‑6, procalcitonin) and 
microbiological diagnostics (arthrocentesis with synovial analysis and 
microbiology) are indicated; however, in addition to the arthrocentesis result, 
the clinical appearance is crucial in cases where an exclusion cannot be 
confirmed by laboratory parameters. If an infection is confirmed, the treatment 
depends on the spectrum of pathogens, the soft tissue situation and the 
comorbidities, including a multistage procedure with temporary explantation and, 
if necessary, implantation of an antibiotic-containing spacer is necessary. 
A prosthesis preservation using the debridement, antibiotics and implant 
retention (DAIR) regimen is only appropriate in an acute infection situation. 
Basically, radical surgical debridement should be carried out to reduce the 
pathogen load and treatment of a possible biofilm formation for both early and 
late infections. The subsequent antibiotic treatment (short or long interval) 
should be coordinated with the infectious disease specialists.
CONCLUSION: A structured approach for prosthesis infections oriented to an 
evidence-based algorithm provides a sufficient possibility of healing. An 
interdisciplinary approach involving cooperation between orthopedic and 
infectious disease specialists has proven to be beneficial. Surgical treatment 
with the aim of reducing the bacterial load by removing the biofilm with 
subsequent antibiotic treatment is of intrinsic importance.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Endoprotheseninfekte stellen Arzt und 
Patienten vor große Herausforderungen. Durch den Anstieg der endoprothetischen 
Versorgung aufgrund der steigenden Lebenserwartung ist mit einer Zunahme von 
Endoprotheseninfekten zu rechnen. Neben den Methoden der Infektprophylaxe rücken 
bei zunehmendem geriatrischem und polymorbidem Patientengut Methoden der 
Infektbeherrschung in den Vordergrund mit dem Ziel, durch ein strukturiertes 
Vorgehen bei infizierter Prothese die hohe 1‑Jahres-Mortalität zu senken.
ALGORITHMUS BEI PROTHESENINFEKTEN: Protheseninfekte lassen sich grundsätzlich in 
Früh- und Spätinfekte unterteilen, hierbei wird ein Spätinfekt gemäß den 
Kriterien des International Consensus Meetings als ein Auftreten 30 Tage nach 
durchgeführter Implantation bezeichnet. Hinsichtlich des geplanten Vorgehens 
bietet die (p)TNM-Klassifikation eine Orientierung. Im frühen postoperativen 
Intervall ist das klinische Erscheinungsbild entscheidend, da in dieser Phase 
weder laborchemische Parameter noch eine Synoviaanalyse eine hohe Sensitivität 
zeigen. Grundsätzlich ist, abgesehen vom septischen Patienten, eine 
Umfelddiagnostik einzuleiten. Bei Verdacht auf Spätinfekt sind neben einer 
radiologischen Diagnostik (Röntgen, Skelettszintigraphie, ggf. 
Computertomographie) eine laborchemische (CRP [C-reaktives Protein], Leukozyten, 
Blutsenkung, ggf. Interleukin‑6, Procalcitonin) und mikrobiologische Diagnostik 
(Punktion mit Synoviaanalyse und Mikrobiologie) angezeigt. Maßgeblich ist jedoch 
auch hier neben dem Punktionsergebnis das klinische Erscheinungsbild bei keinem 
sicheren Ausschluss durch laborchemische Parameter. Bei Infektnachweis ist 
abhängig vom Keimspektrum, von der Weichteilsituation und den 
Begleiterkrankungen u. a. ein mehrzeitiges Vorgehen mit temporärer Explantation 
und ggf. Implantation eines antibiotikahaltigen Spacers notwendig. Ein 
Prothesenerhalt unter Anwendung des DAIR(„debridement, antibiotics and implant 
retention“)-Regimes ist einzig in der akuten Infektsituation zielführend. 
Grundsätzlich sollte sowohl beim Früh- als auch Spätinfekt zur Reduktion der 
Keimlast und Behandlung einer möglichen stattgehabten Biofilmbildung ein 
radikales chirurgisches Débridement erfolgen. Die nachfolgende antibiotische 
Therapie (kurzes bzw. langes Intervall) sollte in Abstimmung mit der 
Infektiologie erfolgen.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Ein strukturiertes Vorgehen bei Protheseninfekten, orientiert 
an einem evidenzbasierten Algorithmus, bietet eine suffiziente 
Heilungsmöglichkeit. Hierbei zeigt sich ein interdisziplinärer Ansatz unter 
Zusammenarbeit von Orthopädie und Infektiologie als zielführend. Von immanenter 
Wichtigkeit ist die chirurgische Therapie mit dem Ziel der Reduktion der 
Keimlast unter der Prämisse der Biofilmentfernung mit nachfolgender 
antibiotischer Therapie.

BACKGROUND: In women ≥ 70 years of age with T1N0 hormone receptor-positive 
(HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, 
breast surgery type and omission of axillary surgery or radiation therapy (RT) 
do not impact overall survival. Although frailty and life expectancy ideally 
factor into therapy decisions, their impact on therapy receipt is unclear. We 
sought to identify trends in and factors associated with locoregional therapy 
type by frailty and life expectancy.
METHODS: Women ≥ 70 years of age with T1N0 HR+/HER2- breast cancer diagnosed in 
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database between 
2010 and 2015 were stratified by validated claims-based frailty and life 
expectancy measures. Therapy trends over time by regimen intensity ('high 
intensity': lumpectomy + axillary surgery + RT, or mastectomy + axillary 
surgery; 'moderate intensity': lumpectomy + RT, lumpectomy + axillary surgery, 
or mastectomy only; or 'low intensity': lumpectomy only) were analyzed. Factors 
associated with therapy type were identified using generalized linear mixed 
models.
RESULTS: Of 16,188 women, 21.8% were frail, 22.2% had a life expectancy < 5 
years, and only 12.3% fulfilled both criteria. In frail women with a life 
expectancy < 5 years, high-intensity regimens decreased significantly 
(48.8-31.2%; p < 0.001) over the study period, although in 2015, 30% still 
received a high-intensity regimen. In adjusted analyses, frailty and life 
expectancy < 5 years were not associated with breast surgery type but were 
associated with a lower likelihood of axillary surgery (frailty: odds ratio [OR] 
0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.96; life expectancy < 5 years: OR 
0.22, 95% CI 0.20-0.25). Life expectancy < 5 years was also associated with a 
lower likelihood of RT receipt in breast-conserving surgery patients (OR 0.30, 
95% CI 0.27-0.34).
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of high-intensity therapy are decreasing but overtreatment 
persists in this population. Continued efforts aimed at appropriate 
de-escalation of locoregional therapy are needed.

INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy and the rising incidence of stroke 
in young adults, it is important to know the long-term prognosis of this 
condition. Post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia are common 
complications of stroke that negatively affect prognosis. The purpose of this 
study was to evaluate five-year mortality from stroke and to assess the 
influence of post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia on mortality and 
disability over the five-year period.
METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to the stroke unit for acute stroke or 
transient ischemic attacks were screened for in-hospital delirium. At the three- 
and twelve-month follow-up, the same patients underwent neurocognitive testing. 
Diagnoses of in-hospital delirium and dementia after three and twelve months 
based on DSM-5 criteria. Five years after stroke surviving patients were 
reevaluated. Outcome assessment included place of stay, current functional 
status assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), or death.
RESULTS: At the five-years of follow-up, data were collected from 575 of 750 
patients originally included in the study (76.67%). The mortality rate was 
51.65%. In-hospital post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia diagnosed 
three and twelve months after stroke were independent risk factors for death and 
an increase in mRS score of ≥ 1 or ≥ 2 points. There was no significant 
association with institutionalization rate.
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of post-stroke patients die within five years of 
follow-up. Post-stroke delirium and post-stroke dementia are associated with an 
increased risk of death and disability.

INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive 
disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The phase 3 STELLAR 
trial tested sotatercept plus background therapy (BGT) versus placebo plus BGT. 
BGT was comprised of mono-, double-, or triple-PAH targeted therapy. Building on 
STELLAR findings, we employed a population health model to assess the potential 
long-term clinical impact of sotatercept.
METHODS: Based on the well-established ESC/ERS 4-strata risk assessment 
approach, we developed a six-state Markov-type model (low risk, intermediate-low 
risk, intermediate-high risk, high risk, lung/heart-lung transplant, and death) 
to compare the clinical outcomes of sotatercept plus BGT versus BGT alone over a 
lifetime horizon. State-transition probabilities were obtained from STELLAR. 
Risk stratum-adjusted mortality and lung/heart-lung transplant probabilities 
were based on COMPERA PAH registry data, and the post-transplant mortality 
probability was obtained from existing literature. Model outcomes were 
discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine model 
robustness.
RESULTS: In the base case, sotatercept plus BGT was associated with longer life 
expectancy from model baseline (16.5 vs 5.1 years) versus BGT alone, leading to 
11.5 years gained per patient. Compared with BGT alone, sotatercept plus BGT was 
further associated with a gain in infused prostacyclin-free life years per 
patient, along with 683 PAH hospitalizations and 4 lung/heart-lung transplant 
avoided per 1000 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: According to this model, adding sotatercept to BGT increased life 
expectancy by roughly threefold among patients with PAH while reducing 
utilization of infused prostacyclin, PAH hospitalizations, and lung/heart-lung 
transplants. Real-world data are needed to confirm these findings.

Vector-borne diseases such as dengue, leishmaniasis, and lymphatic filariasis, 
constitute significant sources of illness, disability, and mortality among the 
poor and vulnerable in many countries around the world, including India. Based 
on the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2019, we 
analyse the burden of dengue, leishmaniasis, and lymphatic filariasis, in India 
from 1990 to 2019. Over this period, there was a reduction in the burden of 
lymphatic filariasis and leishmaniasis. Notably, dengue emerged as the most 
common vector-borne disease, exhibiting high fatality rate above 15 years of age 
and the highest DALY within 15-49 age group. Additionally, dengue cases surged 
substantially between 1990 and 2019. Leishmaniasis related mortality and DALY 
declined in the year 2019 compared to the year 1990, with high mortality and 
DALY in the 0-49-year-old age group. For lymphatic filariasis, DALY was more 
pronounce among those in the 15-49-year age group, which underwent reduction in 
2019. Males had a higher burden in other vector-borne diseases than females, 
although females had a slightly elevated dengue burden. These findings highlight 
the evolving epidemiological trends related to vector-borne diseases in India, 
over the last three decades and underline the critical significance of sustained 
efforts for the elimination and control of vector-borne diseases.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV from a progressive and 
often fatal infection to a chronic disease. Currently, people living with HIV 
(PLHIV) have near-normal life expectancy; however, they face accelerated ageing 
and a rise in non-AIDS-defining HIV-associated conditions. Comorbidities 
increase the number of prescribed drugs and, therefore, the risk of polypharmacy 
and prescribing potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). Still, there are 
no specific tools to identify PIMs in older PLHIV, which opens a pathway to 
investigate the particularities in the prescription of medication in this 
population.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review in 5 electronic databases for studies 
reporting the use of tools to identify PIMs in older PLHIV. No language or date 
restrictions were applied. To complete the search, abstracts published in the 
most relevant HIV Conferences and Events in their editions from 2010 to 2022 
were screened.
RESULTS: Of 50,193 records returned (13,701 of the databases and 36,492 of the 
Congresses), 39 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were 
single-centre and conducted in Europe. Twenty-eight studies were 
cross-sectional, and most researchers used explicit criteria, mainly Beers and 
STOPP-START criteria, to identify PIMs.
CONCLUSIONS: Potentially inappropriate prescribing is frequent among older 
PLHIV. Explicit conventional tools to identify PIMs in older populations may 
need to be adapted to tackle the needs of PLHIV. Implicit tools may be more 
valid, although their use is more time-consuming, and standardization is 
complex.

BACKGROUND: Genital psoriasis can be stigmatizing, is highly prevalent among 
patients with psoriasis, and has limited treatment options. Apremilast is a 
unique oral immunomodulating phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor approved for 
psoriasis treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg twice daily in 
patients with genital psoriasis.
METHODS: DISCREET, a phase 3, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03777436), randomized 
patients with moderate-to-severe genital psoriasis (stratified by affected body 
surface area <10% or ≥10%) to apremilast or placebo for a 16-week period, 
followed by an apremilast extension period. Week 16 results are presented.
RESULTS: Patients were randomized to apremilast (n=143) or placebo (n=146). At 
Week 16, 39.6% and 19.5% of apremilast and placebo patients, respectively, 
achieved a modified static Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Genitalia 
response (primary endpoint; score of 0/1, ≥2-point reduction); treatment 
difference was significant (20.1%, P=0.0003). Improvements in genital signs and 
symptoms, skin involvement, and quality of life (QoL) were observed. Common 
treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea, headache, nausea, and 
nasopharyngitis.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of active-comparator.
CONCLUSIONS: Apremilast demonstrated statistically and clinically meaningful 
genital PGA responses and improvement of signs, symptoms, severity, and QoL in 
this first randomized, controlled study of an oral systemic treatment in 
patients with genital psoriasis.

Anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) offer a novel approach to 
treating, preventing, or curing HIV. Pre-clinical models and clinical trials 
involving the passive transfer of bNAbs have demonstrated that they can control 
viremia and potentially serve as alternatives or complement antiretroviral 
therapy (ART). However, antibody decay, persistent latent reservoirs, and 
resistance impede bNAb treatment. This review discusses recent advancements and 
obstacles in applying bNAbs and proposes strategies to enhance their therapeutic 
potential. These strategies include multi-epitope targeting, antibody half-life 
extension, combining with current and newer antiretrovirals, and sustained 
antibody secretion.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor/inhibition (SGLTi), initially approved as 
a glucose-lowering therapy for type 2 diabetes, is associated with decreased 
risks for many of the most common conditions of aging, including heart failure, 
chronic kidney disease, all-cause hospitalization, atrial fibrillation, cancer, 
gout, emphysema, neurodegenerative disease/dementia, emphysema, non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease, atherosclerotic disease, and infections. Studies also show 
that SGLTi improves overall life expectancy and reduces risks of cardiovascular 
death and cancer death. These wide-ranging health benefits are largely 
unexplained by the SGLTi's modest improvements in standard risk factors. SGLTi 
produces upregulation of nutrient deprivation signaling and downregulation of 
nutrient surplus signaling. This in turn promotes autophagy, which helps to 
optimize cellular integrity and prevent apoptotic cell death. SGLTi decreases 
oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, restores of mitochondrial 
health, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, and diminishes proinflammatory and 
profibrotic pathways. These actions help to revitalize senescent cells, tissues, 
and organs. In summary, SGLTi appears to slow aging, prevent disease, and 
improve life expectancy, and its mechanisms of action lend strong biological 
plausibility to this hypothesis. Further randomized trials are warranted to test 
whether SGLTi, a safe and well-tolerated, once-daily pill, might improve 
healthspan and lifespan.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the economic costs, health-related quality-of-life 
outcomes and cost-effectiveness of subthreshold micropulse laser (SML) versus 
standard laser (SL) for the treatment of diabetic macular oedema (DMO) with 
central retinal thickness (CRT) of <400µ.
DESIGN: An economic evaluation was conducted within a pragmatic, multicentre, 
randomised clinical trial, DIAbetic Macular Oedema aNd Diode Subthreshold.
SETTING: 18 UK Hospital Eye Services.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with diabetes and centre involving DMO with CRT<400µ.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants (n=266) were randomised 1:1 to receive SML or SL.
METHODS: The base-case used an intention-to-treat approach conducted from a UK 
National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS) perspective. 
Costs (2019-2020 prices) were collected prospectively over the 2-year follow-up 
period. A bivariate regression of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
with multiple imputation of missing data, was conducted to estimate the 
incremental cost per QALY gained and the incremental net monetary benefit of SML 
in comparison to SL. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty and heterogeneity 
in cost-effectiveness estimates.
RESULTS: One participant in the SL arm withdrew consent for data to be used; 
data from the remaining 265 participants were included in analyses. Mean (SE) 
NHS and PSS costs over 24 months were £735.09 (£111.85) in the SML arm vs 
£1099.70 (£195.40) in the SL arm (p=0.107). Mean (SE) QALY estimates were 1.493 
(0.024) vs 1.485 (0.020), respectively (p=0.780), giving an insignificant 
difference of 0.008 QALYs. The probability SML is cost-effective at a threshold 
of £20 000 per QALY was 76%.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant differences in EQ-5D-5L 
scores or costs between SML and SL. Given these findings and the fact that SML 
does not burn the retina, unlike SL and has equivalent efficacy to SL, it may be 
preferred for the treatment of people with DMO with CRT<400µ.

BACKGROUND: Near-real time surveillance of excess mortality has been an 
essential tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains critical for monitoring 
mortality as the pandemic wanes, to detect fluctuations in the death rate 
associated both with the longer-term impact of the pandemic (e.g. infection, 
containment measures and reduced service provision by the health and other 
systems) and the responses that followed (e.g. curtailment of containment 
measures, vaccination and the response of health and other systems to backlogs). 
Following the relaxing of social distancing regimes and reduction in the 
availability of testing, across many countries, it becomes critical to measure 
the impact of COVID-19 infection. However, prolonged periods of mortality in 
excess of the expected across entire populations has raised doubts over the 
validity of using unadjusted historic estimates of mortality to calculate the 
expected numbers of deaths that form the baseline for computing numbers of 
excess deaths because many individuals died earlier than they would otherwise 
have done: i.e. their mortality was displaced earlier in time to occur during 
the pandemic rather than when historic rates predicted. This is also often 
termed "harvesting" in the literature.
METHODS: We present a novel Cox-regression-based methodology using 
time-dependent covariates to estimate the profile of the increased risk of death 
across time in individuals who contracted COVID-19 among a population of hip 
fracture patients in England (N = 98,365). We use these hazards to simulate a 
distribution of survival times, in the presence of a COVID-19 positive test, and 
then calculate survival times based on hazard rates without a positive test and 
use the difference between the medians of these distributions to estimate the 
number of days a death has been displaced. This methodology is applied at the 
individual level, rather than the population level to provide a better 
understanding of the impact of a positive COVID-19 test on the mortality of 
groups with different vulnerabilities conferred by sociodemographic and health 
characteristics. Finally, we apply the mortality displacement estimates to 
adjust estimates of excess mortality using a "ball and urn" model.
RESULTS: Among the exemplar population we present an end-to-end application of 
our methodology to estimate the extent of mortality displacement. A greater 
proportion of older, male and frailer individuals were subject to significant 
displacement while the magnitude of displacement was higher in younger females 
and in individuals with lower frailty: groups who, in the absence of COVID-19, 
should have had a substantial life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that calculating the expected number of deaths
