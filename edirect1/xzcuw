ISSUE ADDRESSED: Noncommunicable chronic disease underlies much of the life 
expectancy gap experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 
Modifying contributing risk factors; tobacco smoking, nutrition, alcohol 
consumption, physical activity, social and emotional wellbeing (SNAPS) could 
help close this disease gap. This scoping review identified and describes SNAPS 
health promotion programs implemented for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people in Australia.
METHODS: Databases PubMed, CINAHL, Informit (Health Collection and Indigenous 
Peoples Collection), Scopus, Trove and relevant websites and clearing houses 
were searched for eligible studies until June 2015. To meet the inclusion 
criteria the program had to focus on modifying one of the SNAPS risk factors and 
the majority of participants had to identify as being of Aboriginal and/or 
Torres Strait Islander heritage.
RESULTS: The review identified 71 health promotion programs, described in 83 
publications. Programs were implemented across a range of health and community 
settings and included all Australian states and territories, from major cities 
to remote communities. The SNAPS factor addressed most commonly was nutrition. 
Some programs included the whole community, or had multiple key audiences, 
whilst others focused solely on one subgroup of the population such as chronic 
disease patients, pregnant women or youth. Fourteen of the programs reported no 
outcome assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people have not been adequately evaluated. The majority of programs focused on 
the development of individual skills and changing personal behaviours without 
addressing the other health promotion action areas, such as creating supportive 
environments or reorienting health care services. SO WHAT?: This scoping review 
provides a summary of the health promotion programs that have been delivered in 
Australia for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to prevent or manage 
chronic disease. These programs, although many are limited in quality, should be 
used to inform future programs. To improve evidence-based health promotion 
practice, health promotion initiatives need to be evaluated and the findings 
published publicly.

Despite evidence suggesting race and ethnicity are important factors in 
responses to environmental exposures, drug therapies, and disease risk, few 
studies focus on the health needs of racially- and ethnically-diverse aging 
adults.The objective of this study was to determine the burden of 10 health 
conditions across race and ethnicity for a nationally-representative sample of 
aging Americans.Data from the 1998 to 2014 waves of the Health and Retirement 
Study, an ongoing longitudinal-panel study, were analyzed.Those aged over 50 
years who identified as Black, Hispanic, or White were included. There were 5510 
Blacks, 3423 Hispanics, and 21,168 Whites in the study.At each wave, 
participants reported if they had cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
congestive heart failure, diabetes, back pain, hypertension, a fractured hip, 
myocardial infarction, rheumatism or arthritis, and a stroke. 
Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated for each health condition 
by race and ethnicity. Ranked DALYs determined how race and ethnicity was 
differentially impacted by the burden of each health condition. Sample weights 
were utilized to make DALY estimates nationally-representative.Weighted DALY 
estimates (in thousands) ranged from 1405 to 55,631 for Blacks, 931 to 28,442 
for Hispanics, and 15,313 to 295,623 for Whites. Although the health conditions 
affected each race and ethnicity differently, hypertension had the largest 
number of DALYs, and hip fractures had the fewest across race and ethnicity. In 
total, there were an estimated 198,621, 101,462, and 1,187,725 DALYs for older 
Black, Hispanic, and White aging adults.Our findings indicate that race and 
ethnicity may be influential on health and disease for aging adults in the 
United States. Monitoring DALYs may help guide the flow of health-related 
expenditures, improve the impact of health interventions, advance inclusive 
health care for diverse aging adult populations, and prepare healthcare 
providers for serving the health needs of aging adults.

IMPORTANCE: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is a 
breakthrough treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), the most 
common cause of blindness in western countries. Anti-VEGF treatment prevents 
vision loss and has been shown to produce vision gains lasting as long as 5 
years. Although this treatment is costly, the benefits associated with vision 
gains are large.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic value of benefits, costs for patients with 
wAMD, and societal value in the United States generated from vision improvement 
associated with anti-VEGF treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation study used data from 
the published literature to simulate vision outcomes for a cohort of 168 820 
patients with wAMD aged 65 years or older and to translate them into economic 
variables. Data were collected and analyzed from March 2018 to November 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes included patient benefits, costs, and 
societal value. Each outcome was estimated for a newly diagnosed cohort and the 
full population across 5 years, with a focus on year 3 as the primary outcome 
because data beyond that point may be less representative of the general 
population. Drug costs were the weighted mean across anti-VEGF therapies. Two 
current treatment scenarios were considered: less frequent injections (mean 
[SD], 8.2 [1.6] injections annually) and more frequent injections (mean [range], 
10.5 [6.8-13.1] injections annually). The 2 treatment innovation scenarios, 
improved adherence and best case, had the same vision outcomes as the current 
treatment scenarios had but included more patients treated from higher 
initiation and lower discontinuation.
RESULTS: The study population included 168 820 patients aged 65 years at the 
time of diagnosis with wAMD. The underlying clinical trials that were used to 
parameterize the model did not stratify visual acuity outcomes or treatment 
frequency by sex; therefore, the model parameters could not be stratified by 
sex. The current treatment scenario of less frequent injections generated $1.1 
billion for the full population in year 1 and $5.1 billion in year 3, whereas 
the scenario of more frequent injections generated $1.6 billion (year 1) and 
$8.2 billion (year 3). Three-year benefits ranged from $7.3 billion to $11.4 
billion in the improved adherence scenario and from $9.7 billion to $15.0 
billion if 100% of the patients initiated anti-VEGF treatment and the 
discontinuation rates were 6% per year or equivalent to clinical trial 
discontinuation (best-case scenario). Societal value (patient benefits net of 
treatment cost) ranged from $0.9 billion to $3.0 billion across 3 years in the 
current treatment scenarios and from $0.9 billion to $4.3 billion in the 
treatment innovation scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that improved vision 
associated with anti-VEGF treatment may provide economic value to patients and 
society if the outcomes match published outcomes data used in these analyses; 
however, future innovations that increase treatment utilization may result in 
added economic benefit.

The myelin sheath is a plasma membrane extension that lines nerve fibers to 
protect, support and insulate neurons. The myelination of axons in vertebrates 
enables fast, saltatory impulse propagation, and this process relies on 
organelles, especially on mitochondria to supply energy. Approximately 99% of 
mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus. Since mitochondria play a 
central role in the energy production and metabolic pathways, which are 
essential for myelinogenesis, studying these nucleus-encoded genes (nMGs) may 
provide new insights into the roles of energy metabolism in demyelinating 
diseases. In this work, a multiomics-based approach was employed to 1) construct 
a 1,740 human nMG subset with mitochondrial localization evidence obtained from 
the Integrated Mitochondrial Protein Index (IMPI) and MitoCarta databases, 2) 
conduct an evolutionary genomics analysis across mouse, rat, monkey, chimp, and 
human models, 3) examine dysmyelination phenotype-related genes (nMG subset 
genes with oligodendrocyte- ​and myelin-related ​phenotypes, OMP-nMGs) in MGI 
mouse lines and human patients, 4) determine the expression discrepancy of 
OMP-nMGs in brain tissues of cuprizone-treated mice, multiple sclerosis 
patients, and normal controls, and 5) conduct literature data mining to explore 
OMP-nMG-associated disease impacts. By contrasting OMP-nMGs with other genes, 
OMP-nMGs were found to be more ubiquitously expressed (59.1% vs. 16.1%), 
disease-associated (67.3% vs. 20.2%), and evolutionarily conserved within the 
human populations. Our multiomics-based analysis identified 110 OMP-nMGs 
implicated in energy production and lipid and glycan biosynthesis in the 
pathogenesis and pathophysiology of demyelinating disorders. Future targeted 
characterization of OMP-nMGs in abnormal myelination conditions may allow the 
discovery of novel nMG mediated mechanisms underlying myelinogenesis and related 
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Bilateral proximal humerus fractures are rather rare and occur due 
to high energetic traumas in young patients and even low energetic traumas in 
older patients having osteoporosis. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) 
is the most popular treatment for this type of fracture while other types of 
treatment such as arthroplasty or conservative treatment are also, but less 
commonly used.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: This report presents the case of an 80 years old female 
patient with bilateral proximal humerus fractures and a history of 
hypothyroidism. The patient was treated with simultaneous open reduction and 
internal fixation and presented a normal and full-range motion in both shoulders 
after follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Frequency of proximal humerus fractures has increased with the 
increase in life expectancy. Osteoporotic people are at higher risk. Around five 
percent of all extremity fractures are humerus proximal end fractures for people 
below 40 years old and 76 % for cases of people over 40 years old, with females 
being more susceptible. ORIF is the treatment of choice for such fractures. 
Replacement arthroplasty, minimally invasive techniques and conservative 
management are other options depending on fracture characteristics.
CONCLUSION: This is an interesting rare case of simultaneous bilateral proximal 
humerus fractures in an elderly female patient, treated operatively with 
satisfactory results on follow up.

Aims: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis frequently have 
vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which 
are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, fracture, 
CKD progression, and death. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of 
extended-release calcifediol (ERC) vs paricalcitol for the treatment of patients 
with CKD stages 3-4 that have SHPT and VDI.Materials and methods: An economic 
analysis of SHPT treatments among a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients with 
CKD Stage 3 and 4 with SHPT and VDI was developed to estimate differences in the 
rates and costs of CV events, fractures, CKD stage progression, and mortality in 
patients treated with ERC and paricalcitol. A Markov model was developed with 
1-year cycles and a 5-year time horizon from a US Medicare payer perspective 
with costs valued in 2017 US dollars.Results: The outcomes of the model were 
rates of clinical events, total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Across a 1,000-person cohort, ERC 
was the dominant (less costly, more effective) treatment strategy when compared 
with paricalcitol. Treatment with ERC resulted in cost savings of $14.8 M (95% 
CI = -$10.0 M-$45.2 M) and an incremental gain of 340 QALYs (95% CI = 200-496) 
compared to treatment with paricalcitol.Limitations: Bridging biochemical levels 
to clinical outcomes may not represent real-world risk of the clinical events 
modeled. Future real-world outcomes of patients treated with ERC and 
paricalcitol may be used to evaluate the model results.Conclusions: This model 
demonstrated favorable short- and long-term clinical benefits associated with 
the use of ERC in patients with CKD Stage 3 and 4 with SHPT and VDI, suggesting 
ERC may be cost-effective from the Medicare perspective compared to 
paricalcitol.

BACKGROUND: Country-level inequality in life expectancy (ILE) and deaths of 
children under age five due to air pollution (DCAP) can be influenced by 
country-level income per capita, solid fuel, electrification, and natural 
resource depletion. The ILE and DCAP in the short-term are useful indicators 
that can help in developing ways to reduce environmental threats. This study 
confirms evidence for ILE and DCAP as the effects of environmental threats by 
country-level income, energy, and natural resource levels from a socioecological 
approach.
METHODS: This study based on life expectancy and children data on 164 countries 
acquired from the United Nations Development Programme. We obtained the 
country-level socioecological data from the United Nations and the World Bank 
database. We assessed the associations between ILE, DCAP, and the country-level 
indicators applying correlations coefficient and the regression models.
RESULTS: These study findings showed considerable correlations between ILE and 
country-level socioecological indicators: gross national income per capita 
(GNI), non-solid fuel (NSF), electrification rate (ER), and natural resource 
depletion (NRD). The DCAP in short-term predictors were low NSF and low ER 
(R2 = 0.552), and ILE predictors were low GNI, NSF, and ER and higher NRD 
(R2 = 0.816). Thus, the countries with higher incomes and electrification rates 
and more sustainable natural resources had lower expected DCAP in the short-term 
and ILE in the long-term.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we confirmed that country-level income, 
energy, and natural resource indicators had important effects on ILE in 
long-term and DCAP in short-term. We recommend that countries consider targeting 
high standards of living and national incomes, access to non-solid fuel and 
electricity as energy sources, and sustainable natural resources to reduce ILE 
and DCAP in short-term.

BACKGROUND: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare autosomal 
dominant inherited condition affecting multiple endocrine organs, resulting in 
significant morbidity and decreased life expectancy. Early tumor identification 
allows for timely patient management, reduces morbidity, and improves disease 
outcomes. Patients with MEN1 typically present with primary hyperparathyroidism 
caused by multiple parathyroid tumors, however, thymic and bronchial carcinoid 
tumors are also less common manifestations. MEN1-related neuroendocrine tumors 
often show hematogenous metastasis, with the liver being the most common 
metastatic site. Skeletal metastases from neuroendocrine tumors are extremely 
rare. As few as 50 case reports were identified in a recently published 
literature review on skeletal metastases from carcinoid tumors. To our 
knowledge, studies related to MEN1 have not been previously conducted.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of MEN1-related atypical ovarian carcinoid 
presenting as the first disease manifestation in a 30-year old woman. After two 
years, another atypical carcinoid was incidentally diagnosed in the 
contralateral ovary during a caesarean section. Syndromic MEN1 was not diagnosed 
clinically despite her young age and bilateral involvement. The patient remained 
disease-free for two years without further adjuvant treatment prior to clinic 
presentation with complaints of chest discomfort and body pain. Radiologic and 
pathologic investigations identified multifocal simultaneous neuroendocrine 
tumors involving the parathyroid, thymus, pancreas, and adrenal glands, in 
addition to multiple other metastatic sites. The findings ultimately resulted in 
the patient being diagnosed with MEN1.
CONCLUSIONS: This extremely rare case emphasizes that ovarian carcinoids, 
especially when bilateral, could be the initial manifestation of MEN1. The 
significance of this differential diagnosis was highlighted by the subsequent 
detection of widespread skeletal metastasis resulting from the carcinoid tumors. 
A low threshold of suspicion, systemic diagnostic work-up, and regular follow-up 
are of utmost importance to timely diagnosis of MEN1.

BACKGROUND: It has been 8 years since the first case of Middle East respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was reported in Saudi Arabia and the disease is 
still being reported in 27 countries; however, there is no international study 
to estimate the overall burden related of this emerging infectious disease. The 
present study was conducted to assess the burden of premature mortality due to 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we have utilized publicly available 
data from the WHO website related to 1789 MERS patients reported between 
September 23, 2012 and May 17, 2019. To calculate the standard expected years of 
life lost (SEYLL), life expectancy at birth was set according to the 2000 global 
burden of disease study on levels 25 and 26 of West model life tables from 
Coale-Demeny at 82.5 and 80 years for females and males, respectively.
RESULTS: Overall, the total SEYLL in males and females was 10,702 and 
3817.5 years, respectively. The MERS patients within the age range of 
30-59 year-olds had the highest SEYLL (8305.5 years) in comparison to the 
patients within the age groups 0-29 (SEYLL = 3744.5 years) and ≥ 60 years 
(SEYLL = 2466.5 years). The total SEYLL in all age groups in 2012, 2013, 2014, 
2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 71.5, 2006.5, 3162, 4425.5, 1809.5, 878, 
1257.5 and 909 years, respectively. The most SEYLL related to MERS-CoV infection 
was in the early four years of the onset of the pandemic (2012 to 2015) and in 
the last four years of the MERS-CoV pandemic (216 to 2019), a significant 
reduction was observed in the SEYLL related to MERS-CoV infection in the MERS 
patients.
CONCLUSION: We believe that the findings of this study will shed light about the 
burden of premature mortality due to MERS infection in the world and the results 
may provide necessary information for policy-makers to prevent, control, and 
make a quick response to the outbreak of MERS-CoV disease.

PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of the therapeutic DNA vaccine GX-188E for 
inducing regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter, 
open-label, phase II clinical trial of GX-188E in CIN3 patients positive for 
human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16/18. The primary endpoint was to determine the 
histopathologic regression to ≤CIN1 at visit seven (V7; 20 weeks after the first 
GX-188E injection), and an extension study was pursued until visit 8 (V8; 36 
weeks after the first GX-188E injection). HPV-sequencing analysis and an ex vivo 
IFNγ ELISpot assay were performed using the collected cervical biopsy and blood 
samples from patients.
RESULTS: In total, 72 patients were enrolled and underwent randomization. Of 
them, 64 patients were included in per-protocol analysis (V7) and 52 in 
extension analysis (V8). Our data showed 52% (33/64) of patients at V7 and 67% 
(35/52) of patients at V8 presented histopathologic regression after receiving 
the GX-188E injection. We found that 73% (V7) and 77% (V8) of the patients with 
histologic regression showed HPV clearance. HPV clearance and histopathologic 
regression were significantly associated at V7 and at V8. Compared with the 
measurements at V1 (baseline), the patients at V8 with HPV clearance showed 
significantly higher fold changes in their IFNγ ELISpot responses compared with 
those without HPV clearance. The HPV sequence analysis revealed that the HPV 
type 16 E6/E7 variants D25E, V83L, and N29S were inversely associated with 
histopathologic regression at V8.
CONCLUSIONS: GX-188E is an effective therapeutic vaccine against a cohort 
containing only CIN3 patients.

Mutations in the gene AK2 are responsible for reticular dysgenesis (RD), a rare 
and severe form of primary immunodeficiency in children. RD patients have a 
severely shortened life expectancy and without treatment die, generally from 
sepsis soon after birth. The only available therapeutic option for RD is 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To gain insight into the 
pathophysiology of RD, we previously created zebrafish models for Ak2 
deficiencies. One of the clinical features of RD is hearing loss, but its 
pathophysiology and causes have not been determined. In adult mammals, sensory 
hair cells of the inner ear do not regenerate; however, their regeneration has 
been observed in several non-mammalian vertebrates, including zebrafish. 
Therefore, we used our RD zebrafish models to determine whether Ak2 deficiency 
affects sensory organ development and/or hair cell regeneration. Our studies 
indicated that Ak2 is required for the correct development, survival and 
regeneration of sensory hair cells. Interestingly, Ak2 deficiency induces the 
expression of several oxidative stress markers and it triggers an increased 
level of cell death in the hair cells. Finally, we show that glutathione 
treatment can partially rescue hair cell development in the sensory organs in 
our RD models, pointing to the potential use of antioxidants as a therapeutic 
treatment supplementing HSCT to prevent or ameliorate sensorineural hearing 
deficits in RD patients.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is 15 times more prevalent among persons in Spain's 
prisons than in the community. Recently, Spain initiated a pilot program, 
JAILFREE-C, to treat HCV in prisons using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Our 
aim was to identify a cost-effective strategy to scale-up HCV treatment in all 
prisons. Using a validated agent-based model, we simulated the HCV landscape in 
Spain's prisons considering disease transmission, screening, treatment, and 
prison-community dynamics. Costs and disease outcomes under status quo were 
compared with strategies to scale-up treatment in prisons considering 
prioritization (HCV fibrosis stage vs. HCV prevalence of prisons), treatment 
capacity (2,000/year vs. unlimited) and treatment initiation based on sentence 
lengths (>6 months vs. any). Scaling-up treatment by treating all incarcerated 
persons irrespective of their sentence length provided maximum health 
benefits-preventing 10,200 new cases of HCV, and 8,300 HCV-related deaths 
between 2019-2050; 90% deaths prevented would have occurred in the community. 
Compared with status quo, this strategy increased quality-adjusted life year 
(QALYs) by 69,700 and costs by €670 million, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €9,600/QALY. Scaling-up HCV treatment with DAAs for 
the entire Spanish prison population, irrespective of sentence length, is 
cost-effective and would reduce HCV burden.

BACKGROUND: Gerontogenes include those that modulate life expectancy in various 
species and may be the actual longevity genes. We believe that a long (relative 
to body weight) lifespan in individual rodent and primate species can be due, 
among other things, to the loss of particular genes that are present in 
short-lived species of the same orders. These genes can also explain the widely 
different rates of aging among diverse species as well as why similarly sized 
rodents or primates sometimes have anomalous life expectancies (e.g., naked 
mole-rats and humans). Here, we consider the gene loss in the context of the 
prediction of Williams' theory that concerns the reallocation of physiological 
resources of an organism between active reproduction (r-strategy) and 
self-maintenance (K-strategy). We have identified such lost genes using an 
original computer-aided approach; the software considers the loss of a gene as 
disruptions in gene orthology, local gene synteny or both.
RESULTS: A method and software identifying the genes that are absent from a 
predefined set of species but present in another predefined set of species are 
suggested. Examples of such pairs of sets include long-lived vs short-lived, 
homeothermic vs poikilothermic, amniotic vs anamniotic, aquatic vs terrestrial, 
and neotenic vs nonneotenic species, among others. Species are included in one 
of two sets according to the property of interest, such as longevity or 
homeothermy. The program is universal towards these pairs, i.e., towards the 
underlying property, although the sets should include species with quality 
genome assemblies. Here, the proposed method was applied to study the longevity 
of Euarchontoglires species. It largely predicted genes that are highly 
expressed in the testis, epididymis, uterus, mammary glands, and the vomeronasal 
and other reproduction-related organs. This agrees with Williams' theory that 
hypothesizes a species transition from r-strategy to K-strategy. For instance, 
the method predicts the mouse gene Smpd5, which has an expression level 20 times 
greater in the testis than in organs unrelated to reproduction as experimentally 
demonstrated elsewhere. At the same time, its paralog Smpd3 is not predicted by 
the program and is widely expressed in many organs not specifically related to 
reproduction.
CONCLUSIONS: The method and program, which were applied here to screen for gene 
losses that can accompany increased lifespan, were also applied to study reduced 
regenerative capacity and development of the telencephalon, neoteny, etc. Some 
of these results have been carefully tested experimentally. Therefore, we assume 
that the method is widely applicable.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the possible magnitude of the role nurse staffing has on 
increasing life expectancy at birth and at 65 years old.
METHODS: The statistical technique of panel data analysis was applied to 
investigate the relationship from the number of practicing nurses' density per 
1000 population to life expectancy at birth and at 65 years old. Five control 
variables were used as the proxies for the levels of medical staffing, health 
care financial and physical resources, and medical technology. The observations 
of 35 member countries of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) were collected from OECD Health Statistics over 2000-2016 period.
RESULTS: There were meaningful relationships from nurse staffing to life 
expectancy at birth and at 65 years with the long-run elasticities of 0.02 and 
0.08, respectively. Overall, the role of nursing characteristics in increasing 
life expectancy indicators varied among different health care systems of OECD 
countries and in average were determined at the highest level in Japan (0.25), 
followed by Iceland (0.24), Belgium (0.21), Czech Republic (0.21), Slovenia 
(0.20) and Sweden (0.18).
CONCLUSION: A higher proportion of nursing staff is associated with higher life 
expectancy in OECD countries and the dependency of life expectancy to nursing 
staff would increase by aging. Hence, the findings of this study warn health 
policy makers about ignoring the effects nursing shortages create e.g. 
increasing the risk of actual age-specific mortality, especially in care of 
elderly people.

The world's population is aging as a consequence of an increased global life 
expectancy. Identifying simple strategies to promote healthy aging (i.e., 
absence of major chronic diseases, preserved physical and cognitive functions, 
intact mental health, and good quality of life) have emerged as a major public 
health concern. Identifying biomarkers to better characterize the aging process 
is a research priority. Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome 
ends that prevent the loss of genomic DNA, protecting its physical integrity. 
Telomere length (TL) is considered a biomarker of aging: shorter telomeres are 
associated with a decreased life expectancy and increased rates of age-related 
chronic diseases. Telomere attrition has been shown to be accelerated by 
oxidative stress and inflammation. Since edible plants contain plenty of 
compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, it is plausible 
that their sustained consumption might help counteract telomere attrition. In 
this narrative review, we update evidence on the association between plant-rich 
dietary patterns and plant-based foods and TL. First, we summarize findings from 
observational studies on the association between TL and 1) adherence to 
plant-rich dietary patterns (mainly, but not only, focused on the Mediterranean 
diet); 2) consumption of seeds (mostly focused on nuts, grains, and coffee); and 
3) intake of carotenoids, one of the plant-derived bioactives most studied in 
health and disease. Second, we summarize the main randomized controlled trials 
evaluating the effect on TL of dietary interventions involving either plant-rich 
dietary patterns or plant foods. Even though evidence from trials is very 
limited, several observational studies have reinforced the suggestive benefits 
of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (a plant-rich dietary pattern), 
consumption of seeds (and its derivatives), and dietary intake of carotenoids on 
TL, which further supports the research benefits of plant-rich dietary patterns 
and plant foods to promote health and longevity.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing worldwide. This complex 
and multifactorial metabolic condition affects both the quality and expectancy 
of life in adults. Therefore, appropriate lifestyle strategies are needed in 
order to reduce the burden of T2D. Dietary patterns characterized by a high 
consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and a 
minimal consumption of animal products, have been suggested as a dietary 
approach to prevent and control T2D and related micro- and macrovascular 
complications. This narrative review summarizes epidemiologic and clinical trial 
evidence on the role of the most widely studied dietary patterns that emphasize 
the consumption of plant foods [vegetarian, vegan, Mediterranean, and DASH 
(Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets] in the management of T2D and 
its complications. Furthermore, their potential underlying mechanisms are 
discussed. Dietary patterns emphasizing the consumption of plant foods appear to 
confer beneficial effects on glycemic control in different diabetic populations. 
Several components of these dietary patterns might confer benefits on glycemia 
and counterbalance the detrimental effects of animal-based foods. The limited 
evidence on T2D-related complications makes it difficult to draw solid 
conclusions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Applying pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) to 
platelets can extend their shelf life from 5 to 7 days, but there have been few 
systematic studies of the repercussions of such technologies on outdate rates.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The benefits in terms of outdate rates of applying PRT to 
platelets are studied via a mathematical simulation. Specifically, statistical 
methods are used to determine the daily production rate needed to meet demand 
while not exceeding a maximum amount set as a result of limitations on donations 
and while assuring a minimum daily stock.
RESULTS: The results show that a 2-day extension in the shelf life of platelet 
concentrates (PC) results in reductions in outdates ranging from 88·4% to 100% 
at the production centres analysed. It may be the case for budgetary reasons 
that only part of the PCs produced can be treated. This being so, we show that 
if the proportion treated per annum exceeds 25% the best option is to treat part 
of the output every day, otherwise, it is preferable to concentrate treatment on 
the last two production days of the week.
CONCLUSIONS: Extending the shelf life of PC from five to seven days and setting 
up suitable production logistics can drastically reduce outdates at production 
centres. If only a part of all PCs is treated, the best choices are to 
distribute PRT overall production days or, if the percentage of PCs treated is 
very low, to apply PRT on the days preceding the weekend break.
