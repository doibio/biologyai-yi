BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) have been previously linked to 
quality of life, health conditions, and life expectancy in adulthood. Less is 
known about the potential mechanisms which mediate these associations. This 
study examined how ACE influences adult health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
in a low-income community in Florida.
METHODS: A community-based participatory needs assessment was conducted from 
November 2013 to March 2014 with 201 residents of Tampa, Florida, USA. HRQoL was 
measured by an excessive number of unhealthy days experienced during the 
previous 30-day window. Mediation analyses for dichotomous outcomes were 
conducted with logistic regression. Bootstrapped confidence intervals were 
generated for both total and specific indirect effects.
RESULTS: Most participants reported 'good to excellent health' (76%) and about a 
fourth reported 'fair to poor health' (24%). The mean of total unhealthy days 
was 9 days per month (SD ± 10.5). Controlling for demographic and neighborhood 
covariates, excessive unhealthy days was associated with ACE (AOR = 1.23; 95% 
CI: 1.06, 1.43), perceived stress (AOR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.10), and sleep 
disturbance (AOR = 8.86; 3.61, 21.77). Mediated effects were significant for 
stress (β = 0.08) and sleep disturbances (β = 0.11) as they related to the 
relationship between ACE and excessive unhealthy days.
CONCLUSION: ACE is linked to adult HRQoL. Stress and sleep disturbances may 
represent later consequences of childhood adversity that modulate adult quality 
of life.

AIMS: Sine efficiency of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in dialyzed 
patients is still unclear we aim to analyze the outcome of treatment in such 
cohort.
PATIENTS & METHODS: We analyzed treatment outcomes of patients with clear cell 
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with special focus on those who were also treated 
with hemodialysis and described treatment safety and progression-free survival 
of eight patients treated with TKIs and hemodialysis.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: Our report supports statement that TKI treatment of 
dialyzed patients is safe and effective. ccRCC increases risk of developing 
renal insufficiency as well as end-stage renal disease that require dialysis. 
Introduction of multitargeted receptor kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including 
sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib significantly expanded life time expectancy 
of metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma. The advance also applies to patients 
with ccRCC and end-stage renal disease who undergo dialyses.

Research, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.

SETTING: Inaccurate diagnosis and inaccessibility of care undercut the 
effectiveness of high-quality anti-tuberculosis treatment and select for 
resistance. Rapid diagnostic systems, such as Xpert(®) MTB/RIF for tuberculosis 
(TB) diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing (DST), and programs that provide 
high-quality DOTS anti-tuberculosis treatment to patients in the unregulated 
private sector (public-private mix [PPM]), may help address these challenges, 
albeit at increased cost.
OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: We extended a microsimulation model of TB in India calibrated 
to demographic, epidemiologic, and care trends to evaluate 1) replacing DST with 
Xpert; 2) replacing microscopy and culture with Xpert to diagnose 
multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and non-MDR-TB; 3) implementing nationwide PPM; 
and combinations of (3) with (1) or (2).
RESULTS: PPM (assuming costs of $38/person) and Xpert improved health and 
increase costs relative to the status quo. PPM alone or with Xpert cost <1 gross 
domestic product/capita per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to the 
next best intervention, and dominated Xpert interventions excluding PPM.
CONCLUSIONS: While both PPM and Xpert are promising tools for combatting TB in 
India, PPM should be prioritized over Xpert, as private sector engagement is 
more cost-effective than Xpert alone and, if sufficient resources are available, 
would substantially increase the value of Xpert if both interventions are 
implemented together.

From the Women's Health Initiative to the combination of estrogen and selective 
estrogen receptor modulators to avoid progestin addition.

The female life expectancy rose from an average of 48 years to over 80 years in 
a century. The decline in the endogenous production of estrogen (especially the 
main circulating physiological hormone, 17β-estradiol, E2) at menopause (51 
years on average) often leads to functional disorders affecting the quality of 
life. Estrogen deficiency impacts different tissues and results in an increase 
of various diseases, such as osteoporosis or cardiovascular diseases. Hormone 
therapy (HT) for menopause is a rather new challenge which experienced vagaries 
following the women's health initiative (WHI) study conducted in largely 
post-menopausal women. In the first part of this review, we will try to 
summarize the main conclusions of the WHI trials, in particular the timing 
effect as well as the deleterious impact of the associated progestin, 
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Hormone therapy, particularly the conjugated 
equine estrogen (CEE) combined with the MPA favor the occurrence of breast 
cancer, whereas conversely selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such 
as tamoxifen or raloxifene) that block the activity of estrogen receptor alpha 
(ERa) prevent the risk of recurrence of ERa-positive breast cancers. A new 
strategy of ERa modulation called tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), 
combines (1) CEE to maintain the benefits of estrogen (climacteric symptoms and 
prevention of osteoporosis) and (2) bazedoxifene, which is not only a SERM, but 
which also induces a rapid degradation of ERa in the uterus and in the breast, 
thereby prevents the stimulatory effects of estrogens on epithelial 
proliferation of these two sex targets. In the second part of this review, we 
will summarize the recognized benefits of the TSEC approach, and our current 
knowledge of its potential benefits and risks.

Why did life expectancy in Central and Eastern Europe suddenly improve in the 
1990s? An analysis by cause of death.

BACKGROUND: The upturn of life expectancy in Central and Eastern Europe in the 
1990s, after a period of stagnation or even decline, is one of the main events 
in European population history of the late 20th century, but has not been 
satisfactorily explained.
DATA AND METHODS: Turning points in total and cause-specific mortality in the 
Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia were determined 
using joinpoint regression. Changes in life expectancy in the 10 years following 
country-specific turning points were decomposed by age and cause of death using 
Arriaga's method.
RESULTS: Among men, the turning points for all-cause mortality coincided with 
those for ischaemic heart disease in all six countries, and sometimes also with 
those for liver cirrhosis, road traffic accidents and lung cancer. Among women, 
the pattern was more diffuse. In the 10 years since the turning point for 
all-cause mortality, life expectancy increased by around four years for men and 
three years for women in most countries. Declines in mortality from 
cardiovascular disease explain between a third and a half of the increase in 
life expectancy in all countries, but beyond this the contributing causes of 
death often varied considerably.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the upturn of life expectancy in Central and Eastern 
Europe started at different points in time, improvements in prevention and/or 
treatment of ischaemic heart disease appear to have played a role in all six 
countries. Other factors, such as changes in alcohol consumption and road 
traffic safety, have, however, also made important contributions in some 
countries.

AIM: We examined the impact of different behavioral factors of health on the 
variations in the levels and rate of increase in life expectancy in Organization 
for Economic Co-operation and Development countries between 1985 and 2010.
METHODS: Using the World Health Organization's conceptual framework of 
socio-economic determinants of health, we incorporated Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development, World Bank and United Nations data to estimate the 
impact of these variables on life expectancy for 30 Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development countries. We used a random effect model to control 
the fixed effect of year and each country.
RESULTS: Results show that the level of health care spending is the most 
important factor predicting life expectancy. Other important factors are gross 
domestic product per capita, labor productivity, years of schooling and 
percentage of gross domestic product spending allocated for public services. 
Life expectancy was reduced by smoking and higher daily calorie consumption. 
Countries that were previously part of the Soviet Union had lower life 
expectancies. Political factors had only a minor impact on life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy increased an average of 5.1 years in Organization 
for Economic Co-operation and Development countries between 1985 and 2010, but 
there was wide variation. Health spending per capita, economic factors and two 
behavioral factors - smoking and caloric intake - explained most of the 
variation and suggest where increased policy attention could have the greatest 
impact on life expectancy. Policymakers who consider our estimates recognize 
that they may see greater or less impact depending on the characteristics of 
their nation.

Ultrasonography (US) is often the first imaging study performed in patient with 
abdominal pain or vague symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract. To this 
end, it has been demonstrated that transabdominal sonography achieves good to 
excellent results in potential bowel disorders; especially, if ultrasonography 
findings are framed in the context of clinical information. Systemic 
mastocytosis is not a common disease and it usually involves skin, 
gastrointestinal tract and bone. It results from a clonal neoplastic 
proliferation of abnormal mast cells and clinically it can ranges from 
'asymptomatic' with normal life expectancy to 'highly aggressive'. Symptoms are 
caused by the release of mast cells mediators, such as histamine, and by the 
increase bulk of mast cells in the tissue. We present herein a case of systemic 
mastocytosis presenting with abdominal symptomatology due to thickened colonic 
involvement showed by US associated with bone and skin involvement.

Publisher: L’ecografia è spesso considerata l’indagine di primo livello nei 
pazienti con dolore addominale o con altra sintomatologia aspecifica del tratto 
gastrointestinale. A tal proposito, è stato dimostrato che l’ecografia 
transaddominale è in grado di raggiungere anche eccellenti risultati nello 
studio dei disturbi intestinali, soprattutto se inquadrata nel contesto di 
specifiche informazioni cliniche. La mastocitosi sistemica è una rara patologia 
che generalmente coinvolge cute, tratto gastrointestinale e osso. Si tratta di 
proliferazione neoplastica di tipo clonale di mastociti, che clinicamente può 
variare da una sintomatologia lieve con normale aspettativa di vita fino ad un 
quadro altamente aggressivo. I sintomi sono causati dal rilascio dei mediatori 
contenuti nei mastociti, tra i quali l’istamina, e dall’incremento dei mastociti 
nei tessuti. Presentiamo qui un caso di mastocitosi sistemica caratterizzato 
dalla comparsa di sintomatologia addominale dovuta a ispessimento del grosso 
intestino identificato all’esame ecografico, associato a interessamento osseo e 
cutaneo della patologia.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder with significantly shortened life 
expectancy. The major cause of mortality and morbidity is lung disease with 
increasing pulmonary exacerbations and decline in lung function predicting 
significantly poorer outcomes. The pathogenesis of lung disease in CF is 
characterised in part by decreased airway surface liquid volume and subsequent 
failure of normal mucociliary clearance. This leads to accumulation of viscous 
mucus in the CF airway, providing an ideal environment for bacterial pathogens 
to grow and colonise, propagating airway inflammation in CF. The use of 
nebulised hypertonic saline (HTS) treatments has been shown to improve mucus 
clearance in CF and impact positively upon exacerbations, quality of life, and 
lung function. Several mechanisms of HTS likely improve outcome, resulting in 
clinically relevant enhancement in disease parameters related to increase in 
mucociliary clearance. There is increasing evidence to suggest that HTS is also 
beneficial through its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to reduce 
bacterial activity and biofilm formation. This review will first describe the 
use of HTS in treatment of CF focusing on its efficacy and tolerability. The 
emphasis will then change to the potential benefits of aerosolized HTS for the 
attenuation of receptor mediated neutrophil functions, including down-regulation 
of oxidative burst activity, adhesion molecule expression, and the suppression 
of neutrophil degranulation of proteolytic enzymes.

Organisation (CSIRO), Australia.

Cardiovascular disease is a major health problem for all Australians and is the 
leading cause of death in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. In 2010, more 
then 50% of all heart attack deaths were due to repeated events. Cardiac 
rehabilitation programs have been proven to be effective in preventing the 
recurrence of cardiac events and readmission to hospitals. There are however, 
many barriers to the use of these programs. To address these barriers, CSIRO 
developed an IT enabled cardiac rehabilitation program delivered by mobile phone 
through a smartphone app and succesfully trialed it in an urban general 
population. If these results can be replicated in Indigenous populations, the 
program has the potential to significantly improve life expectancy and help 
close the gap in health outcomes. The challenge described in this paper is 
customizing the existing cardiac health program to make it culturally relevant 
and suitable for Indigenous Australians living in urban and remote communities.

The cadmium (Cd) contaminated rice fields in Mae Sot District, Tak Province, 
Thailand has been one of the major environmental problems in Thailand for the 
last 10 years. We used disability adjusted life years (DALYs) to estimate the 
burden of disease attributable to Cd in terms of additional DALYs of Mae Sot 
residents. Cd exposure data included Cd and β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) in urine 
(as an internal exposure dose) and estimated cadmium daily intake (as an 
external exposure dose). Compared to the general Thai population, Mae Sot 
residents gained 10%-86% DALYs from nephrosis/nephritis, heart diseases, 
osteoporosis and cancer depending on their Cd exposure type and exposure level. 
The results for urinary Cd and dietary Cd intake varied according to the studies 
used for risk estimation. The ceiling effect was observed in results using 
dietary Cd intake because of the high Cd content in rice grown in the Mae Sot 
area. The results from β2-MG were more robust with additional DALYs ranging from 
36%-86% for heart failure, cerebral infraction, and nephrosis/nephritis. 
Additional DALYs is a useful approach for assessing the magnitude of 
environmental Cd exposure. The Mae Sot population lost more healthy life 
compared to populations living in a non- or less Cd polluted area. This method 
should be applicable to various types of environmental contamination problems if 
exposure assessment information is available.

Life expectancy has increased considerably throughout the world. In Bangladesh, 
life expectancy has increased from about 53 years in 1975 to 69 years in 2010. 
However, it is unknown whether the increase in life expectancy is simultaneously 
accompanied by an increase in disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). The 
purpose of the study described in this article was to explore the relationship 
between life expectancy and DFLE in the Rajshahi District of Bangladesh by 
examining the relationships between the Active Aging Index (AAI) and DFLE. The 
study fi ndings suggest that urban, more-educated, elderly males are more active 
in all aspects of life and have longer DFLE. Females are found to outlive males 
but are more likely to live a greater part of their remaining life with 
disability. Positive correlations between the AAI and DFLE suggest that older 
adults could enjoy more DFLE by involving themselves in active aging activities.

Health economic analyses of domiciliary dental care and care at fixed clinics 
for elderly nursing home residents in Sweden.

Lundqvist M, Davidson T, Ordell S, Sjöström O, Zimmerman M, Sjögren P.

OBJECTIVES: Dental care for elderly nursing home residents is traditionally 
provided at fixed dental clinics, but domiciliary dental care is an emerging 
alternative. Longer life expectancy accompanied with increased morbidity, and 
hospitalisation or dependence on the care of others will contribute to a risk 
for rapid deterioration of oral health so alternative methods for delivering 
oral health care to vulnerable individuals for whom access to fixed dental 
clinics is an obstacle should be considered. The aim was to analyse health 
economic consequences of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home 
residents in Sweden, compared to dentistry at a fixed clinic.
METHODS: A review of relevant literature was undertaken complemented by 
interviews with nursing home staff, officials at county councils, and academic 
experts in geriatric dentistry. Domiciliary dental care and fixed clinic care 
were compared in cost analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses.
RESULTS: The mean societal cost of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing 
home residents was lower than dental care at a fixed clinic, and it was also 
considered cost-effective. Lower cost of dental care at a fixed dental clinic 
was only achieved in a scenario where dental care could not be completed in a 
domiciliary setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents has a 
lower societal cost and is cost-effective compared to dental care at fixed 
clinics. To meet current and predicted need for oral health care in the ageing 
population alternative methods to deliver dental care should be available.

[Drug therapy of melanoma: anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies].

[Article in French]

Robert C, Mateus C.

Management of patients with metastatic melanoma has improved radically in recent 
years with the development of new drugs capable of signifcantly prolonging life 
expectancy. Two strategies have been implemented: targeted anti-BRAF therapy for 
BRAF-mutated melanomas, and non specific immunotherapies based on anti-CTLA-4 
(ipilimumab) and, more recently, anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. These 
antibodies, by blocking physiological brakes on immune activation, induce an 
indirect immune response. Ipilimumab, a drug approved in 2011 is of benefit to 
20 % of patients but can also trigger significant immune-mediated toxicity. 
Anti-PD-1 antibodies presently in development seem to have a better therapeutic 
index, with higher response rates and less toxicity than ipilimumab. Combination 
therapy with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 v is also giving encouraging preliminary 
results. In future, these new drugs will probably be used in combination, either 
concurrently or sequentially.

This paper is the first to apply prospect theory to societal health-related 
decision making. In particular, we allow for utility curvature, equity 
weighting, sign-dependence, and loss aversion in choices concerning quality of 
life of other people. We find substantial inequity aversion, both for gains and 
losses, which can be attributed to both diminishing marginal utility and 
differential weighting of better-off and worse-off. There are also clear framing 
effects, which violate expected utility. Moreover, we observe loss aversion, 
indicating that subjects give more weight to one group's loss than another 
group's gain of the same absolute magnitude. We also elicited some information 
on the effect of the age of the studied group. The amount of inequity aversion 
is to some extent influenced by the age of the considered patients. In 
particular, more inequity aversion is observed for gains of older people than 
gains of younger people.

INTRODUCTION: Treatment for advanced stage colorectal cancer with synchronous 
peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) and hepatic metastasis (HM) has progressed 
significantly over the past 10 years.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 39-year-old female patient with stage IV 
colorectal cancer with bilateral HM, pulmonary oligometastatic disease, and 
diffuse PC who underwent hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and 
complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for her intra-abdominal disease. The 
patient had an uneventful immediate post-operative recovery, and subsequently 
tolerated multiple cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and percutaneous 
radiofrequency ablation of pulmonary lesions. At her 22-month follow-up 
assessment, the patient remains alive with disease.
CONCLUSION: Current recommendations for surgical management of synchronous 
colorectal cancer PC and HM indicate that patients with less than three HMs, a 
low peritoneal cancer index (PCI), and good functional status will benefit most 
from CRS and HIPEC. Our patient had an elevated PCI of 12 as measured by 
computed tomography imaging, and five HMs (all less than 3 cm in size); however, 
given that her life expectancy on systemic chemotherapy was estimated to be 
approximately 12 months, we have observed carefully selected patients to benefit 
from an aggressive multi-modality approach. This case report demonstrates an all 
too common scenario for surgeons managing patients with advanced CRC, and 
highlights the importance of patient selection for surgical management as part 
of multidisciplinary cancer care in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, fragility fractures of the pelvic 
ring (FFP) are becoming frequent. In elderly, osteoporosis leads to a decrease 
of bone strength and resistance to the ligament's traction; this represents the 
most important difference between FFP and fractures in young patients. Usually, 
these fractures are underestimated and treatment is often conservative.
AIMS: To evaluate clinical and surgical outcomes of surgically treated patients 
with FFP.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 14 patients, in our Trauma Center, 
underwent surgery procedures for FFP between 2012 and 2014. All patients 
attended clinical and radiological investigation at 1, 3, and 6 months 
postoperatively and every year after surgery with a mean follow-up of 22 months.
RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, 11 patients resulted asymptomatic: able to 
maintain standing position and walk without crunches. Two patients were able to 
walk with one crunch. The patient with history of previous acetabular fracture 
walks with two crunches and is still waiting for total hip arthroplasty.
DISCUSSION: The compromised health status and the diminished bone-healing 
capacity, in elderly, decrease chances for a good clinical outcome. In 
literature, many authors suggest that mortality rate in patients with FFP is 
similar to those with hip fracture. Diagnosis of FFP is very important: these 
fractures are highly disabling in elderly and can lead to displacement and 
instability. For these reasons, correct diagnosis and well-conduct preoperative 
plan are necessary to improve stability of fractures and support bone healing. 
After diagnosis, an anti-osteoporotic treatment is indicated to improve bone 
quality and bone healing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows encouraging results and demonstrates that minimally 
or less invasive osteosynthesis technique could lead to good outcome in these 
patients.

Medical advancements have increased life expectancy but have consequently 
increased the incidence of age-related disease. Fasting or dietary restriction 
(DR) can help prevent these via anti-ageing effects; however, these effects in 
neurons are less well characterized. Here, a series of animal and human studies 
of the effects of DR on the structural and functional integrity of neurons and 
the underlying mechanisms are analyzed. DR improves the integrity of animal 
neurons via a wide range of possible mechanisms including changes in metabolism, 
oxidative damage, stress responses, growth factors, and gene expression. These 
mechanisms are extensively interlinked and point to an optimum range of calorie 
intake, above calorie deprivation and below burdensome calorie excess. Human 
studies also suggest that DR improves neuron integrity; however, due to ethical 
and methodological limitations, the most conclusive data on DR hinge upon 
on-going life-long monkey experiments. Rather than developing pharmacological 
mimetics of DR, our focus should be on educating the public about DR in order to 
minimize age-related disease.

BACKGROUND: There are few data regarding clinical care and outcomes of 
Indigenous Australians living with HIV and it is unknown if these differ from 
non-Indigenous HIV-positive Australians.
METHODS: AHOD commenced enrolment in 1999 and is a prospective cohort of 
HIV-positive participants attending HIV outpatient services throughout 
Australia, of which 20 (74 %) sites report Indigenous status. Data were 
collected up until March 2013 and compared between Indigenous and non-Indigenous 
participants. Person-year methods were used to compare death rates, rates of 
loss to follow-up and rates of laboratory testing during follow-up between 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants. Factors associated with time to 
first combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen change were assessed 
using Kaplan Meier and Cox Proportional hazards methods.
RESULTS: Forty-two of 2197 (1.9 %) participants were Indigenous. Follow-up 
amongst Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants was 332 & 16270 person-years, 
respectively. HIV virological suppression was achieved in similar proportions of 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants 2 years after initiation of cART 
(81.0 % vs 76.5 %, p = 0.635). Indigenous status was not independently 
associated with shorter time to change from first- to second-line cART (aHR 
0.95, 95 % CI 0.51-1.76, p = 0.957). Compared with non-Indigenous participants, 
Indigenous participants had significantly less frequent laboratory monitoring of 
CD4 count (rate:2.76 tests/year vs 2.97 tests/year, p = 0.025) and HIV viral 
load (rate:2.53 tests/year vs 2.93 tests/year, p < 0.001), while testing rates 
for lipids and blood glucose were almost half that of non-indigenous 
participants (rate:0.43/year vs 0.71 tests/year, p < 0.001). Loss to follow-up 
(23.8 % vs 29.8 %, p = 0.496) and death (2.4 % vs 7.1 %, p = 0.361) occurred in 
similar proportions of indigenous and non-Indigenous participants, respectively, 
although causes of death in both groups were mostly non-HIV-related.
CONCLUSIONS: As far as we are aware, these are the first data comparing clinical 
outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous HIV-positive Australians. The 
forty-two Indigenous participants represent over 10 % of all Indigenous 
Australians ever diagnosed with HIV. Although outcomes were not significantly 
different, Indigenous patients had lower rates of laboratory testing for HIV and 
lipid/glucose parameters. Given the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease in 
the general Indigenous community, the additional risk factor of HIV infection 
warrants further focus on modifiable risk factors to maximise life expectancy in 
this population.

BACKGROUND: The substantial increase in life expectancy during recent decades 
has left all countries with a high number of elderly people that have particular 
health needs. Health policy-makers must be aware of the most prevalent causes of 
deaths and DALYs in this age group, as well as geriatric syndromes, in order to 
provide appropriate care and allocate resources in an equitable manner.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease study 2010 (GBD 2010), conducted by the 
institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation team, estimated the worldwide burden 
of diseases from 1990 to 2010. Its estimations were conducted on the basis of 
the proportion of deaths, the duration of symptoms and disability weights for 
sequelae, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to different diseases. In 
the present study, we extracted the data regarding the top five most prevalent 
causes of deaths, DALYs, and geriatric syndromes in the elderly based on the 
aforementioned GBD 2010, discussed the results using some tables and figures, 
reviewed the results, described the limitations of GBD 2010, and finally 
provided some recommendations as potential solutions.
RESULTS: According to GBD 2010, the total number of deaths in Iran in 1990 was 
321,627, of which 116,100 were in elderly people (those aged 60 years and 
above), meaning that 36.10% of all deaths occurred in the elderly. Among all 
diseases in this year, the first to third ranked causes of death were ischemic 
heart disease (IHD; 29.44%), neoplasms (13.52%), and stroke (7.24%). In 
comparison, the total number of deaths in Iran increased to 351,814 in 2010, 
with 213,116 of these occurring in the elderly (60.58% of deaths), but the most 
prevalent causes of death remained the same as in 1990. The highest 1990 DALYs 
rates were the result of IHD (21.56%), neoplasms (10.70%), and stroke (4.85%). 
IHD (22.77%), neoplasms (9.48%), and low back pain (LBP; 5.72%) were the most 
prevalent causes of DALYs in older Iranian adults in 2010. The fourth and fifth 
ranked causes of deaths and DALYs in both 1990 and 2010, both in Iran and 
globally, were different diseases and geriatric syndromes in the elderly Iranian 
population.
CONCLUSION: The aged population of Iran is growing steadily, and there is a need 
for health policy-makers to create appropriate programs to meet the health needs 
of elderly people. Although GBD 2010 results are useful in providing burden 
estimations at regional and national levels, each individual country should 
estimate its burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors at a sub-national 
level to obtain further details regarding the health status of its people. As no 
comprehensive study regarding elderly people in Iran has previously been 
conducted, our study will be a major source for identifying the important causes 
of deaths, DALYs, and geriatric syndromes among this population.

Pradesh, India.

CONTEXT: Cost-effectiveness analysis should continually assess competing health 
care options especially in high volume environments like cataract surgery.
AIMS: To compare the cost effectiveness of phacoemulsification (PE) versus 
manual small-incision cataract surgery (MSICS).
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. Tertiary care 
hospital setting.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 52 consenting patients with age-related 
cataracts, were prospectively recruited, and block randomized to PE or MSICS 
group. Preoperative and postoperative LogMAR visual acuity (VA), visual 
function-14 (VF-14) score and their quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
obtained, and the change in their values calculated. These were divided by the 
total cost incurred in the surgery to calculate and compare the cost 
effectiveness and cost utility. Surgery duration was also compared.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Two group comparison with Student's t-test. 
Significance set at P < 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) quoted where 
appropriate.
RESULTS: Both the MSICS and PE groups achieved comparative outcomes in terms of 
change (difference in mean [95% CI]) in LogMAR VA (0.03 [-0.05-0.11]), VF-14 
score (7.92 [-1.03-16.86]) and QALYs (1.14 [-0.89-3.16]). However, with 
significantly lower costs (INR 3228 [2700-3756]), MSICS was more cost effective, 
with superior cost utility value. MSICS was also significantly quicker (10.58 
min [6.85-14.30]) than PE.
CONCLUSIONS: MSICS provides comparable visual and QALY improvement, yet takes 
less time, and is significantly more cost-effective, compared with PE. Greater 
push and penetration of MSICS, by the government, is justifiably warranted in 
our country.

Plant-derived compounds and other natural substances are a rich potential source 
of compounds that kill or attenuate pathogens that are resistant to current 
antibiotics. Medieval societies used a range of these natural substances to 
treat conditions clearly recognizable to the modern eye as microbial infections, 
and there has been much debate over the likely efficacy of these treatments. Our 
interdisciplinary team, comprising researchers from both sciences and 
humanities, identified and reconstructed a potential remedy for Staphylococcus 
aureus infection from a 10th century Anglo-Saxon leechbook. The remedy 
repeatedly killed established S. aureus biofilms in an in vitro model of soft 
tissue infection and killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in a mouse 
chronic wound model. While the remedy contained several ingredients that are 
individually known to have some antibacterial activity, full efficacy required 
the combined action of several ingredients, highlighting the scholarship of 
premodern doctors and the potential of ancient texts as a source of new 
antimicrobial agents.
IMPORTANCE: While the antibiotic potential of some materials used in historical 
medicine has been demonstrated, empirical tests of entire remedies are scarce. 
This is an important omission, because the efficacy of "ancientbiotics" could 
rely on the combined activity of their various ingredients. This would lead us 
to underestimate their efficacy and, by extension, the scholarship of premodern 
doctors. It could also help us to understand why some natural compounds that 
show antibacterial promise in the laboratory fail to yield positive results in 
clinical trials. We have reconstructed a 1,000-year-old remedy which kills the 
bacteria it was designed to treat and have shown that this activity relies on 
the combined activity of several antimicrobial ingredients. Our results 
highlight (i) the scholarship and rational methodology of premodern medical 
professionals and (ii) the untapped potential of premodern remedies for yielding 
novel therapeutics at a time when new antibiotics are desperately needed.

The aging process is a universal phenomenon shared by all living organisms. The 
identification of longevity genes is important in that the study of these genes 
is likely to yield significant insights into human senescence. In this study, we 
have identified Tequila as a novel candidate gene involved in the regulation of 
longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. We have found that a hypomorphic mutation 
of Tequila (Teq(f01792)), as well as cell-specific downregulation of Tequila in 
insulin-producing neurons of the fly, significantly extends life span. Tequila 
deficiency-induced life-span extension is likely to be associated with reduced 
insulin-like signaling, because Tequila mutant flies display several common 
phenotypes of insulin dysregulation, including reduced circulating Drosophila 
insulin-like peptide 2 (Dilp2), reduced Akt phosphorylation, reduced body size, 
and altered glucose homeostasis. These observations suggest that Tequila may 
confer life-span extension by acting as a modulator of Drosophila insulin-like 
signaling.

Noonan syndrome is a relatively common and heterogeneous genetic disorder, 
associated with congenital heart defect in about 50% of the cases. If the defect 
is not severe, life expectancy is normal. We report a case of Noonan syndrome in 
a preterm infant with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lethal outcome associated 
to acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by Adenovirus pneumonia. A novel 
mutation in the RAF1 gene was identified: c.782C>G (p.Pro261Arg) in 
heterozygosity, not described previously in the literature. Consequently, the 
common clinical course in this mutation and its respective contribution to the 
early fatal outcome is unknown. No conclusion can be established regarding 
genotype/phenotype correlation.
