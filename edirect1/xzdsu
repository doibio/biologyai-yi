Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a common infection in developing countries and is 
associated with low socioeconomic status. It is considered a serious infection 
due it its long-term sequelae. Post-TB lung disease decreases life expectancy 
and increases the risk of recurrent TB infection. It also significantly 
increases the risk of other bacterial and fungal infections. Aspergillosis 
develops in the cavitary lesions of TB, worsening them and resulting in a 
deteriorating clinical situation. Concomitant pulmonary TB (PTB) and invasive 
aspergillosis is uncommon, particularly in the absence of factors that suppress 
the immune system. In this report, we describe the case of a healthy young adult 
without previous structural lung damage who presented with primary PTB and acute 
invasive aspergillosis infection, discuss the treatment dilemma and provide a 
literature review.
LEARNING POINTS: Aspergillosis can mimic tuberculosis (TB) infection.Concomitant 
pulmonary TB and invasive aspergillosis is uncommon.The co-administration of 
antifungal and anti-TB medications presents significant therapeutic challenges.

BACKGROUND: Hand vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) and 
myoelectric prostheses have proven their efficacy for treating hand amputation. 
Despite reported functional outcomes, the lack of consensus on VCA versus 
myoelectric prostheses brought us to report on their utilities and costs within 
the Canadian healthcare system.
METHODS: A review of utility outcomes and costs was performed for VCA and 
myoelectric prostheses and a comparison between unilateral versus bilateral 
amputations was made.
RESULTS: The simulation model demonstrated that significant savings could be 
achieved with both hand transplantation ($10.04 billion) and myoelectric 
prostheses ($12.17 billion) in all Canadian patients sustaining hand amputation 
with a 30-year life expectancy., Myoelectric prosthesis had lowest total cost 
compared to hand VCA by generating savings of $4,458,445,840 and $1,868,121,840 
when compared to bilateral and unilateral upper limb amputations respectively.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of unilateral amputations with myoelectric prostheses 
would cost significantly less to the society, whereas the gap in cost savings 
becomes less significant in bilateral amputees. From the socioeconomic 
standpoint of the Canadian healthcare system, this simulation model demonstrates 
that significant savings can be achieved with both treatments.

School Segregation Reduces Life Expectancy in the U.S. Black Population by 9 
Years.

Despite the 1954 Brown versus Board of Education Supreme Court decision, school 
segregation of U.S. blacks persists. Given the powerful role of education as a 
social determinant, health consequences of school segregation are likely to be 
substantial. This study indicates the causal link between school segregation and 
high school graduation and the association of graduation and life expectancy. It 
estimates the reduction in life expectancy associated with school segregation 
and characterizes the prevalence of school segregation of black students in 
states. Lack of high school completion is associated with a reduction in life 
expectancy of 9 years-similar to that of smoking. The prevalence of black school 
segregation (>50% minority) is greatest in the Northeast (81.1%), next highest 
in the South (78.1), next in the Midwest (68.4%), and lowest in the West 
(13.6%). Known remedies to school segregation must be implemented to eliminate 
this root of health inequity.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Conflicting evidence exists on cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk in patients with NAFLD, and data are lacking on whether NAFLD increases 
mortality after a CVD event. Moreover, life expectancy in NAFLD has not been 
studied. We therefore examined CVD risk and life expectancy in patients with 
NAFLD compared with the general population.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this nationwide population-based cohort, all patients 
with NAFLD diagnosis and without baseline CVD (ascertaining from the Swedish 
National Patient Register from 1987 to 2016, n = 10,023) were matched 10:1 on 
age, sex, and municipality to individuals from the general population (controls, 
n = 96,313). CVD diagnosis and mortality were derived from national registers. 
Multistate models and flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate 
adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for CVD risk and loss in life expectancy due to 
NAFLD. We identified 1037 (10.3%) CVD events in patients with NAFLD and 4041 
(4.2%) in controls. CVD risk was 2.6-fold higher in NAFLD compared with controls 
(aHR = 2.61, 95% CI = 2.36-2.88) and was strongest for nonfatal CVD (aHR = 3.71, 
95% CI = 3.29-4.17). After a nonfatal CVD event, the risk for all-cause 
mortality was similar between patients with NAFLD and controls (aHR = 0.89, 95% 
CI = 0.64-1.25). Life expectancy in patients with NAFLD was, on average, 2.8 
years lower than controls, with the highest loss of life-years when NAFLD was 
diagnosed in middle age (40-60 years).
CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD was associated with a higher risk of nonfatal CVD but did not 
affect post-CVD mortality risk. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD have a lower life 
expectancy than the general population.

Understanding how and why animals use the environments where they occur is both 
foundational to behavioral ecology and essential to identify critical habitats 
for species conservation. However, some behaviors are more difficult to observe 
than others, which can bias analyses of raw observational data. To our 
knowledge, no method currently exists to model how animals use different 
environments while accounting for imperfect behavior-specific detection 
probability. We developed an extension of a binomial N-mixture model (hereafter 
the behavior N-mixture model) to estimate the probability of a given behavior 
occurring in a particular environment while accounting for imperfect detection. 
We then conducted a simulation to validate the model's ability to estimate the 
effects of environmental covariates on the probabilities of individuals 
performing different behaviors. We compared our model to a naïve model that does 
not account for imperfect detection, as well as a traditional N-mixture model. 
Finally, we applied the model to a bird observation data set in northwest Costa 
Rica to quantify how three species behave in forests and farms. Simulations and 
sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the behavior N-mixture model produced 
unbiased estimates of behaviors and their relationships with predictor variables 
(e.g., forest cover, habitat type). Importantly, the behavior N-mixture model 
accurately characterized uncertainty, unlike the naïve model, which often 
suggested erroneous effects of covariates on behaviors. When applied to field 
data, the behavior N-mixture model suggested that Hoffmann's woodpecker 
(Melanerpes hoffmanii) and Inca dove (Columbina inca) behaved differently in 
forested versus agricultural habitats, while turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota 
superciliosa) did not. Thus, the behavior N-mixture model can help identify 
habitats that are essential to a species' life cycle (e.g., where individuals 
nest, forage) that nonbehavioral models would miss. Our model can greatly 
improve the appropriate use of behavioral survey data and conclusions drawn from 
them. In doing so, it provides a valuable path forward for assessing the 
conservation value of alternative habitat types.

Intravenous iron for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in China: a 
patient-level simulation model and cost-utility analysis comparing ferric 
derisomaltose with iron sucrose.

OBJECTIVES: Two intravenous (IV) iron formulations, ferric derisomaltose (FDI) 
and iron sucrose (IS), are currently available for the treatment of iron 
deficiency anemia (IDA) in China. Clinical studies have demonstrated that FDI 
has an improved efficacy and safety profile versus IS, while requiring fewer 
infusions to correct iron deficits. Based on these findings, the present study 
evaluated the costs and benefits of FDI and IS for the treatment of IDA, from a 
healthcare system and societal perspective in China.
METHODS: A patient-level model was developed to project time to hematological 
response and incidence of cardiovascular adverse events and hypersensitivity 
reactions (HSRs) associated with FDI and IS over 5 years. Costs included iron 
acquisition, administration, and adverse event/HSR treatment costs, based on 
published studies, fee schedules, and a physician survey. Health state utilities 
associated with adverse events, HSRs, and the number of infusions were obtained 
from the literature and a time trade-off survey.
RESULTS: From a healthcare system perspective, FDI was associated with 
incremental costs of RMB 1,934 (purchasing power parity USD 462) and incremental 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.078 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
versus IS, yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio of RMB 24,901 (USD 5,949) 
in the base case scenario. From a societal perspective, FDI was associated with 
reduced total costs and therefore dominant versus IS.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations included the absence of clinical data specific to China 
and insufficient data to model persistence with treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first cost-utility analysis comparing FDI and IS for 
the treatment of IDA in China. Based on a patient-level model, FDI was found to 
improve quality of life and reduce administration and adverse events costs 
relative to IS. Using the 2020 Chinese gross domestic product per capita of RMB 
72,447 (USD 17,307) as a cost-effectiveness threshold, FDI would be considered 
cost-effective in China.

Plain Language Summary: Ferric derisomaltose (FDI) was approved in February 2021 
for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in China and allows for fast 
iron correction in one visit with a good safety profile. The current standard of 
care in China is iron sucrose (IS). Clinical and economic decision-making can 
benefit from having longer-term projections on the benefits and costs of new 
medications relative to the current standard of care, which is why we conducted 
the first cost-utility analysis of FDI and IS for China. We developed a 
patient-level model that captured the effects of the iron formulations on IDA, 
in addition to incidences of adverse events and hypersensitivity reactions 
(HSRs) associated with either formulation. Costs of the iron formulations, their 
administration, and of treatments for adverse events and HSR were modeled 
alongside the quality of life effects of IDA, adverse events, HSRs, and iron 
infusions. We used published clinical data and Chinese cost data to inform our 
model. Our results show that FDI was associated with higher quality-adjusted 
life expectancy than IS, regardless of the perspective of the analysis, and 
higher total costs from the healthcare system perspective. From a societal 
perspective, FDI was associated with lower costs due to reduced travel and 
waiting time and smaller productivity losses given there were fewer 
appointments. These results imply that FDI is likely good value for money for 
the healthcare system and indeed cost-saving for society relative to IS, which 
has so far been the most widely used IV iron treatment in China.

Sickle cell disease is prevalent in large numbers of patients in the United 
States and has a significant global impact. Its complications span numerous 
organs and lead to reduced life expectancy. Acute and chronic sickle cell pain 
is a common cause of patient suffering. The American Society of Hematology 
published updated guidelines on management of acute and chronic pain from sickle 
cell disease in 2019. Several of the recommendations are conditional and leave 
specific decisions to the treating physician. These include conditional 
recommendations about the use of ketamine for acute pain and the initiation and 
discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Here, 2 
hematologists discuss these guidelines and make contrasting recommendations for 
the management of acute and chronic pain for a patient with sickle cell disease.

Itaconate (ItA), a byproduct of the Krebs cycle, has recently emerged as an 
anti-inflammatory metabolite for inhibiting the overactive immune response. In 
addition to its immunomodulatory and antimicrobial effects, ItA may have other 
therapeutic avenues. Herein, the effect of ItA on aging was explored in order to 
better establish the therapeutic potential of this promising metabolite. ItA 
extended the lifespan and enhanced the stress resistance of Caenorhabditis 
elegans (C. elegans), even at the doses of 0.01 and 0.1 μM. Moreover, the 
lifespan extension effect of ItA was pronounced even for the aged worms (days 7 
and 9 post adult stage). Furthermore, ItA was found to extend the healthy 
longevity of C. elegans in a mitochondria-dependent manner. ItA protected the 
mitochondrial integrity, increased ATP content, and decreased the reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in C. elegans. Mechanistic investigations showed that ItA 
specifically activated the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in 
worms and significantly increased the expression of activating transcription 
factor associated with stress-1 (ATFS-1) that senses mitochondrial stress and 
communicates with the nucleus during the UPRmt. ItA extended the lifespan of C. 
elegans in an ATFS-1-dependent manner. In summary, this study elucidates the 
molecular mechanism by which ItA extends the healthy lifespan and highlights the 
importance of mitochondrial integrity in the intervention of aging.

BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common types 
of leukemia in the western world which affects mainly the elderly population. 
Progress of the disease is very heterogeneous both in terms of necessity of 
treatment and life expectancy. The current scoring system for prognostic 
evaluation of patients with CLL is called CLL-IPI and predicts the general 
progress of the disease but is not a measure or a decision aid for the necessity 
of treatment. Due to the heterogeneous behavior of CLL it is important to 
develop tools that will identify if and when patients will necessitate treatment 
for CLL. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) has spread to many public health fields 
including diagnosis and prognosis of diseases.
OBJECTIVE: Existing machine learning methods for CLL treatment prediction rely 
on expensive tests, such as genetic tests, rendering them useless in peripheral 
or low-resource clinics such as those in developing countries. We aim to develop 
a model for predicting whether a patient will need treatment for CLL within two 
years of diagnosis using a machine learning model based on only on demographic 
data and routine laboratory tests.
METHOD: We conducted a single center study that included adult patients (above 
the age of 18) that were diagnosed with CLL according to the IWCLL criteria and 
were under observation at the hematology unit of the Bnai-Zion medical center 
between 2009 and 2019. Patient data include demographic, clinical and laboratory 
measures that were extracted from patients' medical records anonymously. All 
laboratory results, during the observation period, were extracted for the entire 
cohort. Multiple ML approaches for classifying whether a patient will require 
treatment during a predetermined period of 2 years were evaluated. Performance 
of the ML models was measured using repeated cross validation. We evaluated the 
use of SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for explaining what influences the 
models decision. Additionally, we employ a method for extracting a single 
decision tree from the ML model which enables the doctor to understand the main 
logic governing the model prediction.
RESULTS: The study included 109 patients of them 67 males (61%). Patients were 
under observation for a median of 44 months and the median age was 65 (age 
range: 45-87). 64% of the cohort received therapy during follow-up. A Gradient 
Boosting Model (GBM) model using all of the extracted variables to identify the 
need for treatment in the coming two years among patients with CLL achieved the 
AUPRC of 0.78 (±0.08). An identical GBM model, without genetic/FISH and 
flowcytometry (FACS) data, such that it can be used in peripheral clinics, 
scored an AUPRC of 0.7686 (±0.0837). A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) using the 
same features, scored an AUPRC of 0.7535 (±0.0995). All the models described 
above surpassed the performance of CLL-IPI that was evaluated using the CLL-TIM 
model. According to the SHAP results, red blood cell (RBC) count was the most 
predictive value for the necessity for treatment, where a high value is 
associated with a low probability of requiring treatment in the coming two 
years. Additionally, the SHAP method was used for estimating the personal risk 
of a random patient and showed sensible results. A simple Decision Tree 
classifier showed that patients who had a hemoglobin level of less than 13 gm/dL 
and a Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) less than 0.063, which constituted 
34% percent of the patients included in our study, had a high probability (76%) 
of requiring treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine Learning algorithms that were evaluated in this work for 
predicting the necessity of treatment for patients with CLL achieved reasonable 
accuracy which surpassed that of CLL-IPI which was evaluated using the CLL-TIM 
model. Furthermore, we found that a machine learning model trained exclusively 
using inexpensive features only incurred a modest decrease in performance 
compared to the model trained using all of the features. Due to the small number 
of patients in this study it is necessary to validate the results on a larger 
population.

Cosmetic and food products containing water are prone to contamination during 
the production, storage, and transit process, leading to product spoilage and 
degraded organoleptic characteristics. The efficient preservation of food and 
cosmetics is one of the most important issues the industry is facing today. The 
use of nanotechnology in food and cosmetics for preservation purposes offers the 
possibility to boost the activity of antimicrobial agents and/or promote their 
safer distribution into the end product upon incorporation into packaging or 
film constructions. In this review, current preservation strategies are 
discussed and the most recent studies in nanostructures used for preservation 
purposes are categorized and analyzed in a way that hopefully provides the most 
promising strategies for both the improvement of product safety and shelf-life 
extension. Packaging materials are also included since the container plays a 
major role in the preservation of such products. It is conclusively revealed 
that most of the applications refer to the nanocomposites as part of the 
packaging, mainly due to the various possibilities that nanoscience offers to 
this field. Apart from that, the route of exposure being either skin or the 
gastrointestinal system involves safety concerns, and since migration of 
nanoparticles (NPs) from their container can be measured, concerns can be 
minimized. Conclusion: Nanomaterial science has already made a significant 
contribution to food and cosmetics preservation, and rapid developments in the 
last years reinforce the belief that in the future much of the preservation 
strategies to be pursued by the two industries will be based on NPs and their 
nanocomposites.

The progressively increasing use of nanomaterials (NMs) has awakened issues 
related to nanosafety and its potential toxic effects on human health. Emerging 
studies suggest that NMs alter cell communication by reshaping and altering the 
secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), leading to dysfunction in recipient 
cells. However, there is limited understanding of how the physicochemical 
characteristics of NMs alter the EV content and their consequent physiological 
functions. Therefore, this review explored the relevance of EVs in the 
nanotoxicology field. The current state of the art on how EVs are modulated by 
NM exposure and the possible regulation and modulation of signaling pathways and 
physiological responses were assessed in detail. This review followed the manual 
for reviewers produced by The Joanna Brigs Institute for Scoping Reviews and the 
PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR): checklist and explanation. 
The research question, "Do NMs modulate cellular responses mediated by EVs?" was 
analyzed following the PECO model (P (Population) = EVs, E (Exposure) = NMs, C 
(Comparator) = EVs without exposure to NMs, O (Outcome) = Cellular 
responses/change in EVs) to help methodologically assess the association between 
exposure and outcome. For each theme in the PECO acronym, keywords were defined, 
organized, and researched in PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, 
EMBASE, and Cochrane databases, up to 30 September 2021. In vitro, in vivo, ex 
vivo, and clinical studies that analyzed the effect of NMs on EV biogenesis, 
cargo, and cellular responses were included in the analysis. The methodological 
quality assessment was conducted using the ToxRTool, ARRIVE guideline, Newcastle 
Ottawa and the EV-TRACK platform. The search in the referred databases 
identified 2944 articles. After applying the eligibility criteria and two-step 
screening, 18 articles were included in the final review. We observed that 
depending on the concentration and physicochemical characteristics, specific NMs 
promote a significant increase in EV secretion as well as changes in their 
cargo, especially regarding the expression of proteins and miRNAs, which, in 
turn, were involved in biological processes that included cell communication, 
angiogenesis, and activation of the immune response, etc. Although further 
studies are necessary, this work suggests that molecular investigations on EVs 
induced by NM exposure may become a potential tool for toxicological studies 
since they are widely accessible biomarkers that may form a bridge between NM 
exposure and the cellular response and pathological outcome.

Cancer patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and, notably, a 
significant prevalence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It has been shown that 
an elevated presence of cardiovascular risk factors in this setting leads to an 
interaction between these two conditions, influencing their therapeutic 
strategies and contributing to higher mortality. Nonetheless, cancer patients 
have generally not been evaluated in ACS trials, so that the treatment in these 
cases is still not fully known. We reviewed the current literature and discussed 
the best management for these very high-risk patients. The treatment strategy 
must be tailored based on the cancer type and stage, balancing thrombotic and 
bleeding risks. When the prognosis is longer than six months, especially if a 
clinical instability coexists, patients with ACS and cancer should be referred 
for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as soon as possible. Moreover, an 
invasive strategy should be preferred in STEMI patients as well as in NSTEMI 
patients who are considered as high risk. On the contrary, in clinically stable 
NSTEMI patients, a conservative non-invasive strategy could be adopted, 
especially in cases of a poor life expectancy and/or of high risk of bleeding. 
Drug-Eluting-Stents (DES) should be the first choice if an invasive strategy is 
adopted. Conservative therapy could instead be considered in cancer patients 
with more stable CAD at an increased risk of major bleeding complications. 
However, the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and 
clopidogrel is recommended, but it should be as short as possible, whereas 
triple antithrombotic therapy is non-advised because it significantly increases 
the risk of bleeding. ACS management among cancer patients should be based on an 
accurate evaluation of the risk of thrombosis and bleeding. Future studies 
focused on choosing optimal strategies in tumor patients with ACS should be 
performed to treat this subset of patients better.

Hip arthroplasty is a common procedure in elective orthopaedic surgery that has 
excellent outcomes. Hip replacement surgery aims to create a "forgotten" joint, 
i.e., a pain-free joint akin to a native articulation. To achieve such goals, 
hip arthroplasty must be personalised. This is achieved by restoring: the centre 
of rotation of the native hip; leg length equality; femoral offset; femoral 
orientation; soft tissue tension; joint stability with an unrestricted hip range 
of motion; and having appropriate stress transfer to the bone. In addition, the 
whole pathway should provide an uneventful and swift postoperative recovery and 
lifetime implant survivorship with unrestricted activities. At our institution, 
the preferred option is a personalized total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a large 
diameter head (LDH) using either monobloc or dual-mobility configuration for the 
acetabular component. LDH THA offers an impingement-free range of motion and a 
reduced risk of dislocation. The larger head-neck offset allows for a 
supraphysiologic range of motion (ROM). This can compensate for a patient's 
abnormal spinopelvic mobility and surgical imprecision. Additionally, LDH 
bearing with a small clearance exerts a high suction force, which provides 
greater hip micro-stability. With appropriate biomechanical reconstruction, LDH 
THA can restore normal gait parameters. This results in unrestricted activities 
and higher patient satisfaction scores. We use LDH ceramic on ceramic for our 
patients with a life expectancy of more than 20 years and use LDH dual mobility 
bearings for all others.

The aim of this study was to examine for the presence of differences in 
neuromuscular and psychological function in individuals with recurrent neck pain 
(RNP) or chronic neck pain (CNP) following a whiplash trauma compared to healthy 
controls. A secondary aim was to examine whether neuromuscular characteristics 
together with psychological features in people with RNP were predictive of 
future painful episodes. Multiple features were assessed including neck 
disability, kinesiophobia, quality of life, cervical kinematics, proprioception, 
activity of superficial neck flexor muscles, maximum neck flexion and extension 
strength, and perceived exertion during submaximal contractions. Overall, those 
with RNP (n = 22) and CNP (n = 8) presented with higher neck disability, greater 
kinesiophobia, lower quality of life, slower and irregular neck movements, and 
less neck strength compared to controls (n = 15). Prediction analysis in the RNP 
group revealed that a higher number of previous pain episodes within the last 12 
months along with lower neck flexion strength were predictors of higher neck 
disability at a 6-month follow-up. This preliminary study shows that 
participants with RNP presented with some degree of altered neuromuscular 
features and poorer psychological function with respect to healthy controls and 
these features were similar to those with CNP. Neck flexor weakness was 
predictive of future neck disability.

The world population growth and average life expectancy rise have increased the 
number of people suffering from non-communicable diseases, namely 
osteoarthritis, a disorder that causes a significant increase in the years lived 
with disability. Many people who suffer from osteoarthritis undergo replacement 
surgery. Despite the relatively high success rate, around 10% of patients 
require revision surgeries, mostly because existing implant technologies lack 
sensing devices capable of monitoring the bone-implant interface. Among the 
several monitoring methodologies already proposed as substitutes for traditional 
imaging methods, cosurface capacitive sensing systems hold the potential to 
monitor the bone-implant fixation states, a mandatory capability for long-term 
implant survival. A multifaceted study is offered here, which covers research on 
the following points: (1) the ability of a cosurface capacitor network to 
effectively monitor bone loosening in extended peri-implant regions and 
according to different stimulation frequencies; (2) the ability of these 
capacitive architectures to provide effective sensing in interfaces with 
hydroxyapatite-based layers; (3) the ability to control the operation of 
cosurface capacitive networks using extracorporeal informatic systems. In vitro 
tests were performed using a web-based network sensor composed of striped and 
interdigitated capacitive sensors. Hydroxyapatite-based layers have a minor 
effect on determining the fixation states; the effective operation of a sensor 
network-based solution communicating through a web server hosted on Raspberry Pi 
was shown. Previous studies highlight the inability of current bone-implant 
fixation monitoring methods to significantly reduce the number of revision 
surgeries, as well as promising results of capacitive sensing systems to monitor 
micro-scale and macro-scale bone-interface states. In this study, we found that 
extracorporeal informatic systems enable continuous patient monitoring using 
cosurface capacitive networks with or without hydroxyapatite-based layers. 
Findings presented here represent significant advancements toward the design of 
future multifunctional smart implants.

Software Architecture Patterns for Extending Sensing Capabilities and Data 
Formatting in Mobile Sensing.

Kongens Lyngby, Denmark.

Mobile sensing—that is, the ability to unobtrusively collect sensor data from 
built-in phone and attached wearable sensors—have proven to be a powerful 
approach to understanding the behavior, well-being, and health of people in 
their everyday life. Different platforms for mobile sensing have been presented 
and significant knowledge on how to facilitate mobile sensing has been 
accumulated. However, most existing mobile sensing platforms only support a 
fixed set of mobile phone and wearable sensors which are `built into’ the 
platform’s generic `study app’. This creates some fundamental challenges for the 
creation and approval of application-specific mobile sensing studies, since 
there is little support for adapting the sensing capabilities to what is needed 
for a specific study. Moreover, most existing platforms use their own 
proprietary data formats and there is no standardization in how data are 
collected and in what formats. This poses some fundamental challenges to 
realizing the vision of using mobile sensing in health applications, since 
mobile sensing data collected across different phones and studies cannot be 
compared, thus hampering generalizability and reproducibility across studies. 
This paper presents two software architecture patterns enabling (i) dynamic 
extension of mobile sensing to incorporate new sensing capabilities, such as 
collecting data from a wearable sensor, and (ii) handling real-time 
transformation of data into standardized data formats. These software patterns 
are derived from our work on CARP Mobile Sensing (CAMS), which is a 
cross-platform (Android/iOS) software architecture providing a reactive and 
unified programming model that emphasizes extensibility. This paper shows how 
the framework uses the two software architecture patterns to add sampling 
support for an electrocardiography (ECG) device and support data transformation 
into the new Open mHealth (OMH) data format. The paper also presents data from a 
small study, demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of using CAMS for data 
collection and transformation in mobile sensing.

Maintaining quality of life with an increase in life expectancy is considered 
one of the global problems of our time. This review explores the possibility of 
using natural plant compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
anti-glycation, and anti-neurodegenerative properties to slow down the onset of 
age-related changes. Age-related changes such as a decrease in mental abilities, 
the development of inflammatory processes, and increased risk of developing type 
2 diabetes have a significant impact on maintaining quality of life. Herbal 
preparations can play an essential role in preventing and treating 
neurodegenerative diseases that accompany age-related changes, including 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Medicinal plants have known sedative, 
muscle relaxant, neuroprotective, nootropic, and antiparkinsonian properties. 
The secondary metabolites, mainly polyphenolic compounds, are valuable 
substances for the development of new anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic agents. 
Understanding how mixtures of plants and their biologically active substances 
work together to achieve a specific biological effect can help develop targeted 
drugs to prevent diseases associated with aging and age-related changes. 
Understanding the mechanisms of the biological activity of plant complexes and 
mixtures determines the prospects for using metabolomic and biochemical methods 
to prolong active longevity.

The cytochrome P450 superfamily are heme-thiolate enzymes able to carry out 
monooxygenase reactions. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of 
using a soluble bacterial reductase from Bacillus megaterium, BMR, as an 
artificial electron transfer partner fused to the human P450 domain in a single 
polypeptide chain in an approach known as ‘molecular Lego’. The 3A4-BMR chimera 
has been deeply characterized biochemically for its activity, coupling 
efficiency, and flexibility by many different biophysical techniques leading to 
the conclusion that an extension of five glycines in the loop that connects the 
two domains improves all the catalytic parameters due to improved flexibility of 
the system. In this work, we extend the characterization of 3A4-BMR chimeras 
using differential scanning calorimetry to evaluate stabilizing role of BMR. We 
apply the ‘molecular Lego’ approach also to CYP19A1 (aromatase) and the data 
show that the activity of the chimeras is very low (<0.003 min−1) for all the 
constructs tested with a different linker loop length: ARO-BMR, ARO-BMR-3GLY, 
and ARO-BMR-5GLY. Nevertheless, the fusion to BMR shows a remarkable effect on 
thermal stability studied by differential scanning calorimetry as indicated by 
the increase in Tonset by 10 °C and the presence of a cooperative unfolding 
process driven by the BMR protein domain. Previously characterized 3A4-BMR 
constructs show the same behavior of ARO-BMR constructs in terms of thermal 
stabilization but a higher activity as a function of the loop length. A 
comparison of the ARO-BMR system to 3A4-BMR indicates that the design of each 
P450-BMR chimera should be carefully evaluated not only in terms of electron 
transfer, but also for the biophysical constraints that cannot always be 
overcome by chimerization.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between 
the standing trunk extension angle and medial elbow injuries. Subjects and 
methods: The study participants were 90 male baseball pitchers (10−12 years) 
belonging to youth baseball teams. Pitching elbow injuries were evaluated by an 
orthopedic surgeon using ultrasound scans and physical examination findings. A 
single optical three-dimensional motion analysis system was used for the trunk 
extension measurements, with three-dimensional coordinates captured. The 
overall, upper, and lower trunk angles were then analyzed. Results: Trunk 
extension angle during standing trunk extension was significantly smaller among 
participants who were positive for medial elbow injuries on ultrasound scans 
(positive: 71.4° ± 10.3°; negative: 75.7° ± 9.2°; t = 2.05, p < 0.05). The upper 
trunk extension angle was significantly smaller than the lower trunk extension 
angle among participants who were positive for medial elbow injuries on physical 
examination (upper: 33.0° ± 6.9°; lower: 41.2° ± 8.2°; t = −2.42, p < 0.05). 
Conclusions: Trunk extension angle during standing trunk extension is associated 
with medial elbow injuries. Evaluating the trunk extension angle as multiple 
segments rather than a single rigid body is valuable.
