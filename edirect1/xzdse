Tanshinones found in Salvia species are the main active compounds for the 
treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but their contents are 
hugely different in different species. For example, tanshinone IIA content in 
Salvia castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib. is about 49 times higher than that in 
Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. The molecular mechanism responsible for this 
phenomenon remains largely unknown. To address this, we performed comparative 
transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of S. miltiorrhiza and S. castanea. A 
total of 296 genes in S. castanea and 125 genes in S. miltiorrhiza were highly 
expressed at both the transcriptional and proteome levels, including hormone 
signal regulation, fungus response genes, transcription factors, and CYP450. 
Among these differentially expressed genes, the expression of SmWRKY61 was 
particularly high in S. castanea. Overexpression of SmWRKY61 in S. miltiorrhiza 
could significantly increase the content of tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA, 
which were 11.09 and 33.37 times of the control, respectively. Moreover, 
SmWRKY61 had a strong regulatory effect, elevating the expression levels of 
tanshinone pathway genes such as DXS2, CMK, HMGS2, 1, KSL1, KSL2, CYP76AH1, and 
CYP76AK3. For the WRKY family, 79 SmWRKYs were originally obtained and 
classified into three main groups. Collinearity analysis indicated a more 
specific extension of WRKY gene family in Salvia genus. In 55 Salvia species, 
only 37 species contained the WRKY61 sequence, and high SmWRKY61 expression in 
some Salvia L. species was often accompanied by high tanshinone accumulation. 
The above results suggest that SmWRKY61 is a highly effective regulator of 
tanshinone accumulation and may be a key factor resulting in high tanshinone 
accumulation in S. castanea.

BACKGROUND: Planning of surgical procedures for spinal fusion is performed on 
standing radiographs, neglecting the fact that patients are mostly in the 
sitting position during daily life. The awareness about the differences in the 
standing and sitting configuration of the spine has increased during the last 
years. The purpose was to provide an overview of studies related to seated 
imaging for spinal fusion surgery, identify knowledge gaps and evaluate future 
research questions.
METHODS: A literature search according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMASc) was performed to identify reports related to seated imaging for 
spinal deformity surgery. A summary of the finding is presented for healthy 
individuals as well as patients with a spinal disorder and/or surgery.
RESULTS: The systematic search identified 30 original studies reporting on 1) 
the pre- and postoperative use of seated imaging of the spine (n=12), 2) seated 
imaging of the spine for non - surgical evaluation (n=7) and 3) seated imaging 
of the spine among healthy individuals (12). The summarized evidence illuminates 
that sitting leads to a straightening of the spine decreasing thoracic kyphosis 
(TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), the sacral slope (SS). Further, the postural change 
between standing and sitting is more significant on the lower segments of the 
spine. Also, the adjacent segment compensates the needed postural change of the 
lumbar spine while sitting with hyperkyphosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The spine has a different configuration in standing and sitting. 
This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge about such differences 
and reveals that there is minimal evidence about their consideration for 
surgical planning of spinal fusion surgery. Further, it identifies gaps in 
knowledge and areas of further research.

This study updates the mycobiota resident in groundnut seeds, their phenology 
during storage with the view to ascertain their occurrence, potential toxigenic 
species, and pathologically important species in the stored samples. The 
moisture content of the seeds ranged from 5.7% to 6.5% within the stipulated 
safe moisture content of 8% for extension of shelf life. Culturing the seeds on 
mycological media (Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar SDA; Oxytetracycline Glucose Yeast 
Extract OGYE, Potato Dextrose Agar, PDA) caused a de novo growth of the 
quiescent spores at 28-30°C for 7-14 days. Fungal population counts on the three 
media ranged from 2.01 to 2.16 log10 CFU/g samples to a final 6-month count of 
1.67-2.60 log10 CFU/g. Eighteen different fungal species belonging to ten genera 
were encountered on the media, namely Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Curvularia, 
Fusarium, Penicillium, Trichoderma, Rhizopus, Rhodotorula, Sporendonema, and 
Paecilomyces. Aspergillus spp. (A. niger, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, and 
A. terreus) were the most frequently isolated, followed by Fusarium species 
(F. oxysporum, F. solani, and F. verticillioides), Trichoderma (T. harzianum and 
T. viride), Rhizopus spp (R. oligosporus and R. stolonifer), and Penicillium 
verrucosum. The species which were seed borne (A. niger, A. flavus, A. terreus, 
A. fumigatus, F. solani, F. verticillioides, T. viride, C. herbarum, and 
Curvularia lunata) were isolated on both surface sterilized and non-surface 
sterilized seeds. The phenology of the encountered fungal species generally 
followed five patterns. The most frequently isolated Aspergillus niger, 
A. flavus, and A. fumigatus predominated throughout the 6 months sampling 
period, while A. ustus and A. terreus appeared sporadically and disappeared. The 
early colonizers (R. oligosporus, R. stolonifer, and Paecilomyces) could not be 
isolated after 2-3 months owing presumably to stronger antibiosis competition 
from the Aspergillus species. The most predominant Aspergillus species initially 
constituted 36%-48% of the total population but declined to 10%-36% in 6 months. 
Mycobiota encountered with mycotoxigenic potential and human health importance 
were A. niger, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, F. verticillioides, and Penicillium 
verrucosum. Other species of pathological importance to plants were Curvularia 
lunata and Fusarium oxysporum. The practical implications of these findings are 
discussed.

Near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered shape memory polymers are expected to have a 
more promising prospect in biomedical applications compared with traditional 
heat-triggered shape memory polymers. In this work, a new kind of polyurethane 
with NIR light-triggered shape memory property was prepared by using 
polycaprolactone (PCL), polydopamine nanoparticles (PDANPs), hexamethylene 
diisocyanate (HDI), and 1,4-butanediol (BDO). The synthesized PCL-PDA 
polyurethanes, especially when the weight content of PDANPs was 0.17%, showed 
excellent mechanical properties because the PDANPs were well-dispersed in 
polyurethanes by the chain extension reaction. Moreover, it also showed an NIR 
light-triggered rapid shape recovery because of the photothermal effect of 
polydopamine. The in vitro and in vivo tests showed that the PCL-PDA 
polyurethane would not inhibit cell proliferation nor induce a strong host 
inflammatory response, revealing the non-cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility 
of the material. In addition, the PCL-PDA polyurethane exhibited excellent in 
vivo NIR light-triggered shape memory performance under an 808 nm laser with low 
intensity (0.33 W cm-2), which was harmless to the human skin. These results 
demonstrated the potential of the PCL-PDA polyurethane in biomedical implant 
applications.

BACKGROUND: SSaSS (Salt Substitute and Stroke Study), a 5-year cluster 
randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that replacing regular salt with a 
reduced-sodium, added-potassium salt substitute reduced the risks of stroke, 
major adverse cardiovascular events, and premature death among individuals with 
previous stroke or uncontrolled high blood pressure living in rural China. This 
study assessed the cost-effectiveness profile of the intervention.
METHODS: A within-trial economic evaluation of SSaSS was conducted from the 
perspective of the health care system and consumers. The primary health outcome 
assessed was stroke. We also quantified the effect on quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Health care costs were identified from participant health 
insurance records and the literature. All costs (in Chinese yuan [¥]) and QALYs 
were discounted at 5% per annum. Incremental costs, stroke events averted, and 
QALYs gained were estimated using bivariate multilevel models.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up of the 20 995 participants was 4.7 years. Over this 
period, replacing regular salt with salt substitute reduced the risk of stroke 
by 14% (rate ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77-0.96]; P=0.006), and the salt substitute 
group had on average 0.054 more QALYs per person. The average costs (¥1538 for 
the intervention group and ¥1649 for the control group) were lower in the salt 
substitute group (¥110 less). The intervention was dominant (better outcomes at 
lower cost) for prevention of stroke as well as for QALYs gained. Sensitivity 
analyses showed that these conclusions were robust, except when the price of 
salt substitute was increased to the median and highest market prices identified 
in China. The salt substitute intervention had a 95.0% probability of being 
cost-saving and a >99.9% probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Replacing regular salt with salt substitute was a cost-saving 
intervention for the prevention of stroke and improvement of quality of life 
among SSaSS participants.

BACKGROUND: Refractory chronic migraine is a common and debilitating neurologic 
condition, affecting over 8 million people in the United States. It is 
associated with billions of dollars in lost productivity annually. Novel medical 
(anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies) and surgical treatment 
modalities have emerged for chronic migraine in recent years. The current study 
investigated the cost-utility of surgical versus medical management of 
refractory chronic migraine.
METHODS: A Markov cohort analysis using hybrid Monte Carlo patient simulation 
was performed to compare surgical decompression versus erenumab for the 
treatment of refractory chronic migraine in adults. Both societal and payer 
perspectives were considered. Primary model outcomes included incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, or cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, migraine surgery was associated with an increase 
of 0.2 quality-adjusted life-year per patient when compared to erenumab. In 
terms of costs, the results demonstrated a $19,337 decrease in direct medical 
costs and a $491 decrease in indirect costs (productivity lost) for the surgery 
cohort compared to erenumab. Because surgery improved quality of life and 
decreased costs compared to erenumab, even when considering revision surgery 
needs, surgery was the overall dominant treatment in terms of 
cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that surgery was 
cost-effective compared to erenumab when patients required therapy for at least 
1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical deactivation of migraine trigger sites may pose a 
cost-effective approach to treating refractory chronic migraine in adults. This 
is especially the case when patients are anticipated to require therapy for more 
than 1 year.

Sutureless/rapid-deployment (SURD) valves are options different from the stented 
prostheses included in the pivotal trials comparing surgical aortic valve 
replacement (AVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We 
performed a meta-analysis with reconstructed time-to-event data of matched 
studies published by November 2021 to compare SURD-AVR and TAVI. Primary 
endpoints were 30-day mortality and overall survival in the follow-up. Secondary 
endpoints included: 30-day stroke, acute kidney injury (AKI), major bleeding, 
permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), paravalvular leak (PVL), 
prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM), postoperative aortic valve area (AVA), and 
mean gradients. Ten studies met our eligibility criteria, including a total of 
5134 patients (2567 underwent SURD-AVR and 2567 underwent TAVI). Pooled risk of 
30-day mortality did not favor any group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.69; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.31-1.53; p = 0.360). Patients undergoing SURD-AVR had lower 
risk of PVL (OR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.05-0.17; p < 0.001). No statistically 
significant differences were observed for 30-day stroke, AKI, major bleeding, 
PPI, PPM, and postoperative AVA. In the follow-up, we observed a higher risk of 
mortality (hazard ratio: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.26-2.40; p < 0.001) with TAVI. Patients 
who underwent SURD-AVR experienced better survival, however, the interpretation 
of these results warrant caution due to the fact that SURD-AVR patients tended 
to be younger than TAVI patients. Structural heart surgeons and interventional 
cardiologists should consider initial risk and life expectancy when referring 
patients for one approach over the other.

We aimed to examine the association between exposure to work stress and chronic 
disease incidence and loss of chronic disease-free life years in the Danish 
workforce. The study population included 1,592,491 employees, aged 30-59 in 2000 
and without prevalent chronic diseases. We assessed work stress as the 
combination of job strain and effort-reward imbalance using job exposure 
matrices. We used Cox regressions to estimate risk of incident 
hospital-diagnoses or death of chronic diseases (i.e., type 2 diabetes, coronary 
heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
heart failure, and dementia) during 18 years of follow-up and calculated 
corresponding chronic disease-free life expectancy from age 30 to age 75. 
Individuals working in occupations with high prevalence of work stress had a 
higher risk of incident chronic disease compared to those in occupations with 
low prevalence of work stress (women: HR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.05), men: HR 1.12 
(95% CI 1.11-1.14)). The corresponding loss in chronic disease-free life 
expectancy was 0.25 (95% CI - 0.10 to 0.60) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.56-1.11) years in 
women and men, respectively. Additional adjustment for health behaviours 
attenuated these associations among men. We conclude that men working in 
high-stress occupations have a small loss of years lived without chronic disease 
compared to men working in low-stress occupations. This finding appeared to be 
partially attributable to harmful health behaviours. In women, high work stress 
indicated a very small and statistically non-significant loss of years lived 
without chronic disease.

Old yellow enzymes (OYEs) play a critical role in antioxidation, detoxification 
and ergot alkaloid biosynthesis processes in various organisms. The yeast- and 
bacteria-like OYEs have been structurally characterized earlier, however, 
filamentous fungal pathogens possess a novel OYE class, that is, class III, 
whose biochemical and structural intricacies remain unexplored to date. Here, we 
present the 1.6 Å X-ray structure of a class III member, OYE 6 from necrotrophic 
fungus Ascochyta rabiei (ArOYE6), in flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-bound form (PDB 
ID-7FEV) and provide mechanistic insights into their catalytic capability. We 
demonstrate that ArOYE6 exists as a monomer in solution, forms (β/α)8 barrel 
structure harbouring non-covalently bound FMN at cofactor binding site, and 
utilizes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as its preferred 
reductant. The large hydrophobic cavity situated above FMN, specifically 
accommodates 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid and N-ethylmaleimide substrates as 
observed in ArOYE6-FMN-substrate ternary complex models. Site-directed mutations 
in the conserved catalytic (His196, His199 and Tyr201) and FMN-binding (Lys249 
and Arg348) residues render the enzyme inactive. Intriguingly, the ArOYE6 
structure contains a novel C-terminus (369-445 residues) made of three 
α-helices, which stabilizes the FMN binding pocket as its mutation/truncation 
lead to complete loss of FMN binding. Moreover, the loss of the extended 
C-terminus does not alter the monomeric nature of ArOYE6. In this study, for the 
first time, we provide the structural and biochemical insights for a 
fungi-specific class III OYE homologue and dissect the oxidoreductase mechanism. 
Our findings hold broad biological significance during host-fungus interactions 
owing to the conservation of this class among pathogenic fungi, and would have 
potential implications in the pharmacochemical industry.

OBJECTIVES: Estimation of the lost productivity cost of premature deaths because 
of cancers can provide invaluable information for identifying the priorities and 
resource needs in the design of cancer control strategies. This study aimed to 
estimate the premature mortality costs because of cancers using GLOBOCAN 
estimates in Iran.
METHODS: In this study, we estimated the lost productivity cost of premature 
deaths because of cancers in Iran from 2012 and 2018, using the human capital 
approach with respect to the cancer site, sex, and age. Data on cancer mortality 
were extracted from the GLOBOCAN reports. In addition, economic information, 
such as annual income, employment rate, housekeeping rate, and gross domestic 
product, was extracted from the World Bank Data and the Statistical Center of 
Iran. A discount rate of 3% was applied and costs were reported in constant 2017 
international dollars.
RESULTS: From 2012 and 2018, the lost productivity cost of premature deaths 
because of cancers increased by 18% in Iran ($2453 million in 2012 and $2887 
million in 2018). In contrast, the number of deaths and the years of life lost 
because of cancers increased by approximately 8%. The mortality cost was 
approximately 35% and 56% higher in men than in women in 2012 and 2018, 
respectively. Stomach, colorectal, esophageal, and breast cancers accounted for 
> 40% of total cancer mortality costs in 2012. Stomach cancer, brain cancer, 
nervous system cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia were responsible for 57% of 
cancer mortality costs in 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, the lost productivity costs of premature 
mortality because of cancers have increased significantly in Iran. Overall, 
evidence-based policy making for managing the costs of cancers and resource 
allocation depends on analyzing epidemiological and economic data in the health 
sector. This study presented helpful findings on cancer mortality costs to 
support evidence for decision making in healthcare systems.

Improvements in life expectancy at birth in the UK had stalled prior to 2020 and 
have fallen during the COVID-19 pandemic. The stagnation took place at a time of 
relatively high net migration, yet we know that migrants to Australia, the USA 
and some Nordic countries have positively impacted national life expectancy 
trends, outperforming native-born populations in terms of life expectancy. It is 
important to ascertain whether migrants have contributed positively to life 
expectancy in the UK, concealing worsening trends in the UK-born population, or 
whether relying on national life expectancy calculations alone may have masked 
excess mortality in migrant populations. We need a better understanding of the 
role and contribution of migrant populations to national life expectancy trends 
in the UK.

BACKGROUND: There has been little systematic research on the mortality impact of 
COVID-19 in the Native American population.
OBJECTIVE: We provide estimates of loss of life expectancy in 2020 and 2021 for 
the Native American population.
METHODS: We use data on age-specific all-cause mortality rates from CDC WONDER 
and the 2019 life table recently released by the National Vital Statistics 
System for Native Americans to calculate life tables for the Native American 
population in 2020 and 2021 and obtain estimates of life expectancy reductions 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: The pandemic has set Native Americans further behind other major 
racial/ethnic groups in terms of life expectancy: the estimated loss in life 
expectancy at birth for Native Americans is 4.5 years in 2020 and 6.4 years in 
2021.
CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the disproportionate share of deaths 
experienced by Native Americans: a loss in life expectancy at birth in 2020 that 
is more than three years larger than that for Whites and about 1.5 years greater 
than the losses for the Black and Latino populations. Despite a successful 
vaccination campaign among Native Americans, the estimated loss in life 
expectancy at birth in 2021 unexpectedly exceeds that in 2020. Contribution: The 
increased loss in life expectancy in 2021, despite higher vaccination rates than 
in other racial/ethnic groups, highlights the huge challenges faced by Native 
Americans in their efforts to control the deleterious consequences of the 
pandemic.

As the geriatric population and life expectancy increase, the interest in 
preventing geriatric diseases, such as sarcopenia, is increasing. However, the 
causes of sarcopenia are unclear, and current diagnostic methods for sarcopenia 
are unreliable. We hypothesized that the changes in the expression of certain 
miRNAs may be associated with the pathophysiology of sarcopenia. Herein, we 
analyzed the miRNA expression profiles in the blood of young (3-months-old) 
healthy rats, old sarcopenic (17-months-old) rats, and age-matched 
(17-months-old) control rats. The changes in miRNA expression levels were 
analyzed using Bowtie 2 software. A total of 523 miRNAs were detected in the rat 
serum. Using scatter plots and clustering heatmap data, we found 130 miRNAs that 
were differentially expressed in sarcopenic rats (>2-fold change) compared to 
the expression in young healthy and age-matched control rats. With a threshold 
of >5-fold change, we identified 14 upregulated miRNAs, including 
rno-miR-133b-3p, rno-miR-133a-3p, rno-miR-133c, rno-miR-208a-3p, and 
rno-miR434-5p among others in the serum of sarcopenic rats. A protein network 
map based on these 14 miRNAs identified the genes involved in skeletal muscle 
differentiation, among which Notch1, Egr2, and Myocd represented major nodes. 
The data obtained in this study are potentially useful for the early diagnosis 
of sarcopenia and for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the 
treatment and/or prevention of sarcopenia.

BACKGROUND: There have been controversial findings for the effectiveness of 
rehabilitation before operation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study 
aimed to conduct an updated, comprehensive systematic review. On that basis, the 
review was to be combined with meta-analysis to measure the effects of 
rehabilitation before operation on functions and pain after TKA.
METHODS: Articles were searched by using Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, Pubmed, CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu and 
the Chinese Biomedical Database from the beginning to December 10, 2021. The 
major outcomes included pain, knee flexion and extension, as well as knee range 
of motion (ROM). Secondary outcomes included timed-up-and-go (TUG), 6-min walk, 
and patient-reported functional outcome (the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS) or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index (WOMAC)). Third outcomes included the length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies recruiting 1008 patients satisfied with the inclusion 
criteria. Significant difference was identified in knee flexion, TUG, KOOS 
(knee-associated life quality and functions in sports and recreation), as well 
as the length of hospital stay (P < 0.05). Insignificant statistical difference 
was identified in pain, 6-min walk, ROM, knee extension, KOOS (pain, symptoms 
and function of daily living) after TKA between the two groups. No difference 
was found between the groups in WOMAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative rehabilitation could significantly shorten hospital 
stay, whereas there is not any conclusive evidence of the improvement of 
postoperative functions. Accordingly, in-depth high-quality studies should be 
conducted to confirm the effectiveness of preoperative rehabilitation in 
patients having received TKA.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess early graft failure after 
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction according to chronicity of ACL 
deficiency (ACLD) and clarify predisposing factors.
METHODS: A total of 731 patients who underwent anatomic ACL reconstruction were 
divided into 3 groups based on chronicity of ACLD: <6 months (Group 1), 6 months 
to 2 years (Group 2), and >2 years (Group 3). Types of ACL grafts used included 
single-bundle hamstring tendon (HT), multiple-bundle HT, and rectangular 
bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) grafts. Preoperatively and immediately 
postoperatively, lateral radiographs in full extension were taken to examine 
anterior tibial subluxation (ATS). All ACL grafts were evaluated by MRI at 6 
months to identify graft failure. The group with the highest failure rate was 
further examined to compare possible risk factors between the intact and failure 
subgroups, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify 
predisposing factors.
RESULTS: Early graft failure on MRI without any episode of postoperative trauma 
was observed in 7 (1.4%), 2 (1.8%), and 11 (9.2%) patients in Groups 1, 2, and 
3, respectively, with a significantly higher rate in Group 3 (P < 0.001). Of the 
119 patients in Group 3, significant differences were observed between intact 
and failure subgroups with regard to surgical procedure (P = 0.03), chondral 
lesions (P < 0.01), and preoperative ATS (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis revealed that surgical procedures (odds ratio, 3.8; 95%CI, 
1.16-12.59) and preoperative ATS (odd ratio, 2.4; 95%CI, 1.26-4.38) were 
predisposing factors of early graft failure.
CONCLUSION: Patients with ACLD for >2 years experienced early graft failure with 
an incidence rate of 9.2%. Predisposing factors of early graft failure in these 
patients included the use of single-bundle HT grafts and preoperative ATS. The 
use of rectangular BTB grafts resulted in a lower graft failure rate.

AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) often coexists in elderly hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients; however, its impact on clinical outcomes is 
unclear.
METHODS: We compared clinical outcomes according to the presence of DM in a 
nationwide HCM cohort.
RESULTS: In 9,883 HCM subjects (mean age 58.5 ± 13.1, men 71.7%), 1,327 (13.4%) 
had DM. During follow-up (mean 5.9 ± 2.5 years), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
progression, coronary events (myocardial infarction, coronary 
revascularization), heart failure (HF), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause 
mortality occurred in 80 (0.8%), 365 (3.7%), 1,558 (15.8%), 354 (3.6%), and 877 
(8.9%) subjects, respectively. DM HCM subjects had significantly higher risks of 
ESRD progression (HR 3.49, 95% CI 2.20-5.54) and HF (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32) 
compared to non-DM HCM subjects, independent of age, sex, ischemic heart 
disease, atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities. There was a tendency for 
greater risk of ESRD progression, HF, and all-cause death in subjects with more 
advanced stage of DM (p-for-trend < 0.05 for all). Insulin-treated DM was 
associated with the highest risk.
CONCLUSIONS: DM HCM subjects have higher risk of ESRD progression and HF. 
Considering the extended life expectancy of HCM and increasing number of elderly 
HCM subjects, active surveillance and management of DM-related outcomes should 
be highlighted.

Gastric Outlet Obstruction: Current Status and Future Directions.

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a relatively common condition in which 
mechanical obstruction of the pylorus, distal stomach, or duodenum causes severe 
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and early satiety. Its 
etiology includes both benign and malignant disorders. Currently, GOO has many 
treatment options, including initial conservative therapeutic protocols and more 
invasive procedures, such as surgical gastroenterostomy, stent placement and, 
the most recently implemented procedure, endoscopic ultrasound-guided 
gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE). Each procedure has its merits, with surgery often 
prevailing in patients with longer life expectancy and stents being used most 
often in patients with malignant gastric outlet stenosis. The newly developed 
EUS-GE combines the immediate effect of stents and the long-term efficacy of 
gastroenterostomy. However, this novel method is a technically demanding process 
that requires expert experience and special facilities. Thus, the true clinical 
effectiveness, as well as the duration of the effects of EUS-GE, still need to 
be determined.

The use of statins for primary prevention in older adults remains controversial. 
In this manuscript, we present a case of an 81-year-old woman with a history of 
HTN, HLD, Alzheimer's dementia and osteoporosis, who presented to a geriatrics 
clinic with profound muscle weakness accompanied by new functional deficits in 
the setting of taking double her prescribed dose of atorvastatin. She was 
admitted to the hospital where she was found to have rhabdomyolysis. Muscle 
biopsy and serologic work up revealed anti-HMG statin co-reductase myopathy as 
the cause of her symptoms. The patient was treated with steroids IVIG and 
immunomodulators with marked improvement in her weakness; however, her course 
was complicated by delirium and multiple falls, resulting in several fragility 
fractures. This case highlights the need to conduct a risk-benefit analysis 
prior to initiating new therapies in patients with limited life expectancy, 
including the consideration of the potential for medication errors.
