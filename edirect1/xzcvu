Radioembolization using 90Y microspheres (glass or resin) has been introduced as 
an effective intraarterial therapy for unresectable primary and metastatic liver 
cancers. Although the basic therapeutic effect of chemoembolization results from 
ischemia, the therapeutic efficacy of radioembolization comes from radiation. 
Furthermore, compared with surgical resection and local ablation therapy, 
radioembolization is available with less limitation on the sites or number of 
liver cancers. The radioisotope 90Y is a β-radiation emitter without 
γ-radiation, with the emission of secondary bremsstrahlung photons and small 
numbers of positrons. Administration of 90Y microspheres into the hepatic artery 
can deliver a high dose of radiation selectively to the target tumor with 
limited radiation exposure to the surrounding normal parenchyma, and has low 
systemic toxicity. In general, radioembolization has been considered for 
patients with unresectable primary or metastatic liver-only or liver-dominant 
cancers with no ascites or other clinical signs of liver failure, life 
expectancy of > 12 weeks, and good performance status. Here, we review the 
current radioactive compounds, pretreatment assessment, and indications for 
radioembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma, and liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of the present study was to systematically review 
the current research knowledge on hospital preparedness tools used in biological 
events and factors affecting hospital preparedness in such incidents in using a 
scoping review methodology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The review process was conducted in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews guideline. Online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and 
Google Scholar) were used to identify papers published that evaluated 
instruments or tools for hospital preparedness in biological disasters (such as 
influenza, Ebola, and bioterrorism events). The search, article selection, and 
data extraction were carried out by two researchers independently.
RESULTS: A total of 3440 articles were screened, with 20 articles identified for 
final analysis. The majority of research studies identified were conducted in 
the United States (45%) and were focused on CBRN incident (20%), Ebola, 
infectious disease and bioterrorism events (15%), mass casualty incidents and 
influenza pandemic (10%), public health emergency, SARS, and biological events 
(5%). Factors that were identified in the study to hospitals preparedness in 
biological events classified in seven areas including planning, surge capacity, 
communication, training and education, medical management, surveillance and 
standard operation process.
CONCLUSIONS: Published evidences of hospital preparedness on biological events 
as well as the overall quality of the psychometric properties of most studies 
were limited. The results of the current scoping review could be used as a basis 
for designing and developing a standard assessment tool for hospital 
preparedness in biological events, and it can also be used as a clear vision for 
the healthcare managers and policymakers in their future plans to confront the 
challenges identified by healthcare institutes in biologic events.

Most implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted for the 
purpose of primary prevention of sudden cardiac death among older patients with 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Shared decision-making prior to 
device implantation is guideline-recommended and payer-mandated. This article 
summarizes patient and provider attitudes toward device placement, device 
efficacy and effectiveness, potential periprocedural complications, long-term 
events such as shocks, quality of life, costs, and shared decision-making 
principles and recommendations. Most patients eligible for an ICD anticipate 
more than 10 years of survival. Physicians are less likely to offer an ICD to 
patients ≥80 years of age given a perceived lack of benefit. There is a dearth 
of data from randomized clinical trials addressing device efficacy among older 
patients; there is a need for more research in this area. However, currently 
available data support the use of ICDs irrespective of age provided life 
expectancy exceeds 1 year. Advanced age is independently associated with 
complications at the time of device placement but not the risk of device 
infection. The risk of inappropriate shock may be comparable or lower than that 
of younger patients. While quality of life is generally not adversely impacted 
by an ICD, a subset of patients experience post-traumatic stress disorder. ICDs 
are cost-effective from societal and health care sector perspectives; however, 
out-of-pocket costs vary according to insurance type and level. Shared 
decision-making encounters may be incremental and iterative in nature. Providers 
are encouraged to partner with their patients, providing them counsel tailored 
to their values, preferences, and clinical presentation inclusive of age.

The cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) form the major family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. 
The prototypic CRLs in yeast, called SCF enzymes, employ a single E2 enzyme, 
Cdc34, to build poly-ubiquitin chains required for degradation. In contrast, six 
different human E2 and E3 enzyme activities, including Cdc34 orthologs UBE2R1 
and UBE2R2, appear to mediate SCF-catalyzed substrate polyubiquitylation in 
vitro. The combinatorial interplay of these enzymes raises questions about 
genetic buffering of SCFs in human cells and challenges the dogma that E3s alone 
determine substrate specificity. To enable the quantitative comparisons of 
SCF-dependent ubiquitylation reactions with physiological enzyme concentrations, 
mass spectrometry was employed to estimate E2 and E3 levels in cells. In 
combination with UBE2R1/2, the E2 UBE2D3 and the E3 ARIH1 both promoted 
SCF-mediated polyubiquitylation in a substrate-specific fashion. Unexpectedly, 
UBE2R2 alone had negligible ubiquitylation activity at physiological 
concentrations and the ablation of UBE2R1/2 had no effect on the stability of 
SCF substrates in cells. A genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that an additional 
E2 enzyme, UBE2G1, buffers against the loss of UBE2R1/2. UBE2G1 had robust in 
vitro chain extension activity with SCF, and UBE2G1 knockdown in cells lacking 
UBE2R1/2 resulted in stabilization of the SCF substrates p27 and CYCLIN E as 
well as the CUL2-RING ligase substrate HIF1α. The results demonstrate the human 
SCF enzyme system is diversified by association with multiple catalytic enzyme 
partners.

BACKGROUND: Historical, colonial, and racist policies continue to influence the 
health of Indigenous people, and they continue to have higher rates of chronic 
diseases and reduced life expectancy compared with non-Indigenous people. We 
determined factors accounting for variations in cardiovascular risk factors 
among First Nations communities in Canada.
METHODS: Men and women (n=1302) aged 18 years or older from eight First Nations 
communities participated in a population-based study. Questionnaires, physical 
measures, blood samples, MRI of preclinical vascular disease, and community 
audits were collected. In this cross-sectional analysis, the main outcome was 
the INTERHEART risk score, a measure of cardiovascular risk factor burden. A 
multivariable model was developed to explain the variations in INTERHEART risk 
score among communities. The secondary outcome was MRI-detected carotid wall 
volume, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis.
FINDINGS: The mean INTERHEART risk score of all communities was 17·2 (SE 0·2), 
and more than 85% of individuals had a risk score in the moderate to high risk 
range. Subclinical atherosclerosis increased significantly across risk score 
categories (p<0·0001). Socioeconomic advantage (-1·4 score, 95% CI -2·5 to -0·3; 
p=0·01), trust between neighbours (-0·7, -1·2 to -0·3; p=0·003), higher 
education level (-1·9, -2·9 to -0·8, p<0·001), and higher social support (-1·1, 
-2·0 to -0·2; p=0·02) were independently associated with a lower INTERHEART risk 
score; difficulty accessing routine health care (2·2, 0·3 to 4·1, p=0·02), 
taking prescription medication (3·5, 2·8 to 4·3; p<0·001), and inability to 
afford prescription medications (1·5, 0·5 to 2·6; p=0·003) were associated with 
a higher INTERHEART risk score. Collectively, these factors explained 28% 
variation in the cardiac risk score among communities. Communities with higher 
socioeconomic advantage and greater trust, and individuals with higher education 
and social support, had a lower INTERHEART risk score. Communities with 
difficulty accessing health care, and individuals taking or unable to afford 
prescription medications, had a higher INTERHEART risk score.
INTERPRETATION: Cardiac risk factors are lower in communities with high 
socioeconomic advantage, greater trust, social support and educational 
opportunities, and higher where it is difficult to access health care or afford 
prescription medications. Strategies to optimise the protective factors and 
reduce barriers to health care in First Nations communities might contribute to 
improved health and wellbeing.

INTRODUCTION: fast-track protocols in total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) 
have improved postoperative recovery and reduced postoperative morbidity. 
Additionally, increasing life expectancy and improved surgical techniques have 
led to an increasing number of older adult patients undergoing THA/TKA. However, 
no large detailed studies on fast-track THA/TKA in older adults are available. 
Consequently, we aimed to describe the length of stay (LOS) and postoperative 
morbidity in a large cohort of patients ≥85 years within a continuous 
multicentre fast-track collaboration.
METHODS: we used a prospective observational cohort design with unselected 
consecutive data between 2010 and 2017 on primary elective THA and TKA patients 
≥85 years. Data were obtained from nine centres reporting to the Lundbeck 
Foundation Centre for Fast-track Hip and Knee Replacement database and the 
Danish National Patient Registry on LOS, readmissions and mortality. Causes of 
morbidity were determined by review of health records.
RESULTS: we included 1,427 (3.9% of all THA/TKA) procedures with 62.3% THA. 
Median age was 87 (IQR: 85-88) years with 71% women. LOS decreased from median 4 
(3-6) days in 2010 to 2 (2-3) days in 2017. The proportion with LOS > 4 days 
decreased from 32 to 18%. Readmission and mortality rate remained at about 11.7 
and 0.9% after 30 days and 16.0 and 1.5% after 90 days, respectively.
CONCLUSION: this detailed large multicentre fast-track THA/TKA study in patients 
≥85 years found major reductions in LOS without increase in readmission or 
mortality rates. The unchanged readmission rate poses an area for further 
improvements.

OBJECTIVES: To document the management of advanced prostate cancer including 
diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and care, in real-world practice in Asia using 
the United in Fight against prOstate cancer (UFO) registry.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We established a multi-national, longitudinal, 
observational registry of patients with prostate cancer presenting to 
participating tertiary care hospitals in eight Asian countries. A total of 3636 
eligible patients with existing or newly diagnosed high-risk localised prostate 
cancer (HRL), non-metastatic biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (M0), or 
metastatic prostate cancer (M1), were consecutively enrolled and are being 
followed-up for 5 years. Patient history, demographic and disease 
characteristics, treatment and treatment decisions, were collected at first 
prostate cancer diagnosis and at enrolment. Patient-reported quality of life was 
prospectively assessed using the European Quality of Life-five Dimensions, five 
Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate 
Cancer questionnaires. In the present study, we report the first interim 
analysis of 2063 patients enrolled from study start (15 September 2015) until 18 
May 2017.
RESULTS: Of the 2063 enrolled patients, 357 (17%), 378 (19%), and 1328 (64%) had 
HRL, M0 or M1 prostate cancer, respectively. The mean age at first diagnosis was 
similar in each group, 56% of all patients had extracapsular extension of their 
tumour, 28% had regional lymph node metastasis, and 53% had distant metastases. 
At enrolment, 62% of patients had at least one co-morbidity (mainly 
cardiovascular disease or diabetes), 91.8% of M1 patients had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of <2 and the mean EQ-5D-5L visual 
analogue score was 74.6-79.6 across cohorts. Treatment of M1 patients was 
primarily with combined androgen blockade (58%) or androgen-deprivation therapy 
(either orchidectomy or luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogues) (32%). 
Decisions to start therapy were mainly driven by treatment guidelines and 
disease progression. Decision to discontinue therapy was most often due to 
disease progression (hormonal drug therapy) or completion of therapy 
(chemotherapy).
CONCLUSION: In the UFO registry of advanced prostate cancer in Asia, regional 
differences exist in prostate cancer treatment patterns that will be explored 
more deeply during the follow-up period; prospective follow-up is ongoing. The 
UFO registry will provide valuable descriptive data on current disease 
characteristics and treatment landscape amongst patients with prostate cancer in 
Asia.

BACKGROUND: Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a first-line treatment option for patients 
with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Patients who fail or are intolerant to IM 
therapy are treated with more expensive second and third-generation tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors. Patients show wide variation in trough concentrations in 
response to standard dosing. Thus, many patients receive subtherapeutic or 
supratherapeutic doses. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may improve dose 
management that, in turn, may reduce costs and improve outcomes. However, TDM 
also adds to the cost of patient care. The objective of this study was to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of TDM for generic IM therapy.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model for the trough plasma 
concentration of IM which is related to a cytogenetic or molecular response. We 
compared two cohorts: one with TDM and one without TDM (NTDM). The lifetime 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the effectiveness measure. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The lifetime cost and QALY of treatment with TDM were $2,137K [95% Ci: 
2,079K; 2,174K] and 12.37 [95% CI: 12.07; 12.55], respectively. The cost and 
QALY of NTDM were $2,132K [95% CI: 2,091K; 2,197K] and 12.23 [95% CI: 11.96; 
12.50], respectively. The incremental cost and QALY for TDM relative to NTDM was 
$4,417 [95% CI: -52,582; 32,097]) and 0.15 [95% CI: -0.13; 0.28]. The ICER for 
TDM relative to NTDM was $30,450/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
that TDM was cost-effective relative to NTDM in 90% of the tested scenarios at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the impact of TDM is modest, the cost-effectiveness over a 
lifetime horizon (societal perspective, ($30,450/QALY) falls within the 
acceptable range (< $100k/QALY).

Multioutput Convolution Spectral Mixture for Gaussian Processes.

Chen K, van Laarhoven T, Groot P, Chen J, Marchiori E.

Multioutput Gaussian processes (MOGPs) are an extension of Gaussian processes 
(GPs) for predicting multiple output variables (also called channels/tasks) 
simultaneously. In this article, we use the convolution theorem to design a new 
kernel for MOGPs by modeling cross-channel dependencies through cross 
convolution of time-and phase-delayed components in the spectral domain. The 
resulting kernel is called multioutput convolution spectral mixture (MOCSM) 
kernel. The results of extensive experiments on synthetic and real-life data 
sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed kernel and its state-of-the-art 
performance. MOCSM enjoys the desirable property to reduce to the well-known 
spectral mixture (SM) kernel when a single channel is considered. A comparison 
with the recently introduced multioutput SM kernel reveals that this is not the 
case for the latter kernel, which contains quadratic terms that generate 
undesirable scale effects when the spectral densities of different channels are 
either very close or very far from each other in the frequency domain.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to assess health research funding allocation 
in South Korea by analysing the relationship between government funding and 
disease burden in South Korea, specifically focusing on cancers.
METHODS: The relationship between research funding and the cancer burden, 
measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), was analysed using a linear 
regression method over a 10-year interval. Funding information on 25 types of 
cancer was obtained from the National Science and Technology Information Service 
portal in South Korea. Measures of cancer burden were obtained from Global 
Burden of Disease studies. The funding predictions were derived from regression 
analysis and compared with actual funding allocations. In addition, we evaluated 
how the funding distribution reflected long-term changes in the burden and the 
burden specific to South Korea compared with global values.
RESULTS: Korean funding in four periods, 2005-2007, 2008-2010, 2011-2013 and 
2015-2017, were associated with the cancer burden in 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2013, 
respectively. For DALYs, the correlation coefficients were 0.79 and 0.82 in 2003 
and 2013, respectively, which were higher than the values from other countries. 
However, the changes in DALYs (1990-2006) were not associated with the funding 
changes (from 2005 to 2007 to 2015-2017). In addition, the value differences 
between Korean and global DALYs were not associated with Korean government 
research funding.
CONCLUSIONS: Although research funding was associated with the cancer burden in 
South Korea during the last decade, the distribution of research funds did not 
appropriately reflect the changes in burden nor the differences between the 
South Korean and global burden levels. The policy-makers involved in health 
research budgeting should consider not only the absolute burden values for 
singular years but also the long-term changes in burden and the country-specific 
burden when they prioritise public research projects.

BACKGROUND: The Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program (CHAP) uses volunteers 
to provide cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes screening in a community 
setting, referrals to primary care providers, and locally available programs 
targeting lifestyle modification. CHAP has been adapted to target older adults 
residing in social housing, a vulnerable segment of the population. Older adults 
living in social housing report poorer health status and have a higher burden of 
a multitude of chronic illnesses, such as CVD and diabetes. The study objective 
is to evaluate whether there is a reduction in unplanned CVD-related Emergency 
Department (ED) visits and hospital admissions among residents of social 
seniors' housing buildings receiving the CHAP program for 1 year compared to 
residents in matched buildings not receiving the program.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial in 
community-based social (subsidized) housing buildings in Ontario and Quebec. All 
residents of 14 matched pairs (intervention/control) of apartment buildings will 
be included. Buildings with 50-200 apartment units with the majority of 
residents aged 55+ and a unique postal code are included. All individuals 
residing within the buildings at the start of the intervention period are 
included (intention to treat, open cohort). The intervention instrument consists 
of CHAP screens for high blood pressure using automated blood pressure monitors 
and for diabetes using the Canadian Diabetes Risk (CANRISK) assessment tool. 
Monthly drop-in sessions for screening/monitoring are held within a common area 
of the building. Group health education sessions are also held monthly. Reports 
are sent to family doctors, and attendees are encouraged to visit their family 
doctor. The primary outcome measure is monthly CVD-related ED visits and 
hospitalizations over a 1-year period post randomization. Secondary outcomes are 
all ED visits, hospitalizations, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and 
participant experience.
DISCUSSION: It is anticipated that CVD-related ED visits and hospitalizations 
will decrease in the intervention buildings. Using the volunteer-led CHAP 
program, there is significant opportunity to improve the health of older adults 
in social housing.

OBJECTIVES: Compared to the general population, psychiatric patients are more 
exposed to physical illness but have reduced access to care.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study in Montpellier between November 2011, 
2nd and December 2012, 21st. Every Wednesday and Friday, the last two inpatients 
admitted in the psychiatric post-emergency unit of the University Hospital of 
Montpellier were assessed by a general practitioner and included in the study. 
This unit takes care of suicidal patients suffering from mood and/or personality 
disorders. The general practitioner assessed lifetime somatic history, current 
somatic comorbidities and medical follow-up for non-psychiatric issues.
RESULTS: One hundred patients were included. The sample consisted of 81% women 
with a mean age of 43 years (18-79 years). The majority of patients had a 
lifetime history of somatic disease (96%) and was followed by a general 
practitioner (99%). Six patients had no met general practitioner for at least 
one year. Dyslipidemia was reported in 32 patients, among those only one patient 
was on lipid-lowering drug (96.88%). Among patients with impaired dental 
condition, 29 (55.77%) had not met a dentist for at least one year. Among those 
with impaired near visual acuity and/or impaired distance visual acuity, 19 
(65.52%) had not met an ophthalmologist for at least one year.
CONCLUSION: Although detected, somatic comorbidities seem outsourced in 
psychiatric patients. Greater awareness among different health professionals 
about the medical care of such patients could improve healthcare management and 
life expectancy.

The deleterious impact of low mental well-being, and higher levels psychological 
symptoms (collectively well-being), on concurrent and prospective health 
outcomes has elsewhere been demonstrated. Further, variables such as conurbation 
and deprivation have been found to be related to mental and physical heath. This 
study used data from a longitudinal study to examine which demographic predicted 
well-being scores, and how scores on these constructs were related to six 
health-related outcomes. Participants were adolescents (N = 4,956; 
Male = 2376[48%]), from 72 High Schools in Northern Ireland. Three waves of data 
were gathered on mental well-being, psychological symptoms, subjective life 
expectancy (living to age 35 and age 75 years), self-rated health, frequency of 
physical exercise, and lifetime use of cigarettes and cannabis. Results showed 
that both well-being scores were significantly associated with gender 
cross-sectionally, but demographic variables did not predict changes in 
well-being longitudinally. Both well-being measures were significantly 
associated with health outcomes cross-sectionally, with mental well-being (over 
time) predicting life subjective life expectancy, self-rated health, and 
addictive behaviors, while psychological symptoms (over time) predicted the 
former two, but not addictive behaviors. Overall, the relationship between 
mental well-being, psychological symptoms, and the health outcomes assessed, was 
small in terms of effect size.

OBJECTIVE: The emergent evaluation of children with suspected traumatic cervical 
spine injuries (CSI) remains a challenge. Pediatric clinical pathways have been 
developed to stratify the risk of CSI and guide computed tomography (CT) 
utilization. The cost-effectiveness of their application has not been evaluated. 
Our objective was to examine the cost-effectiveness of three common strategies 
for the evaluation of children with suspected CSI after blunt injury.
METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model comparing these strategies to 
estimate clinical outcomes and costs for a hypothetical population of 0-17 year 
old patients with blunt neck trauma. Strategies included: 1) clinical pathway to 
stratify risk using NEXUS criteria and determine need for diagnostic testing; 2) 
screening radiographs as a first diagnostic; and 3) immediate CT scanning for 
all patients. We measured effectiveness with quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), and costs with 2018 U.S. dollars. Costs and effectiveness were 
discounted at 3% per year.
RESULTS: The use of the clinical pathway results in a gain of 0.04 QALYs and a 
cost saving of $2800 compared with immediate CT scanning of all patients. Use of 
the clinical pathway was less costly and more effective than immediate CT scan 
as long as the sensitivity of the clinical prediction rule was greater than 87% 
and when the sensitivity of x-ray was greater than 84%.
CONCLUSION: A strategy using a clinical pathway to first stratify risk before 
further diagnostic testing was less costly and more effective than either 
performing CT scanning or screening cervical radiographs on all patients.

INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited 
diseases worldwide. It is associated with lifelong morbidity and reduced life 
expectancy. Hydroxyurea (HU) has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity 
of vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD. Hypoxaemia and intermittent nocturnal oxygen 
desaturations occur frequently in children with SCD and contribute to the 
associated morbidity, including risk of cerebrovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of HU on oxygen saturation (SpO2) overnight 
and on daytime SpO2 spot checks in children with SCD.
METHODS: A retrospective review of children with SCD and respiratory problems 
who attended two UK tertiary sickle respiratory clinics and were treated with 
HU. Longitudinal data were collected from 2 years prior and up to 3 years after 
the commencement of HU.
RESULTS: Forty-three children, 23 males (53%) with a median age of 9 (range 
1.8-18) years were included. In the 21 children who had comparable sleep studies 
before and after starting HU, mean SpO2 was higher (95.2% from 93.5%, p=0.01) 
and nadir SpO2 was higher (87.2% from 84.3%, p=0.009) when taking HU. In 32 of 
the children, spot daytime oxygen saturations were also higher (96.3% from 
93.5%, p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Children with SCD had higher oxygen saturation overnight and on 
daytime spot checks after starting HU. These data suggest HU may be helpful for 
treating persistent hypoxaemia in children with SCD pending more evidence from a 
randomised clinical trial.

Life expectancy has increased substantially; yet universities remain 
age-segregated and fail to educate people across the longer life course. 
Demographic shifts call for universities to change their orientation toward age 
and life course. Arguments as to why universities should serve students of all 
ages and operate as age-diverse communities include: ensuring the capacity of 
individual workers and the labor force; educating people to succeed in 
age-diverse settings; producing innovation in an aging society; supporting 
meaningful engagement, social connection, and cognitive health into later life; 
and ensuring the supply of students. Conceptual foundations for these arguments 
derive from ideas about age stratification, where chronological age is used as a 
criterion for inclusion or exclusion from social expectations, roles, and 
privileges and where age integration is viewed as a positive alternative. In 
response to population aging and the constraints associated with age segregation 
in higher education, the Age-Friendly University Global Network was formed to 
increase the inclusion of older learners in all aspects of university life. The 
challenge is to create conditions where nontraditionally aged students expect to 
engage fully in educational activities, where students of all ages are valued 
and supported, and where age diversity is a common feature of campus life. The 
transformation of our universities must be done for the sake of society, for 
younger and older people, and for the self-interest of institutions themselves.

Cancers in the Central Maghreb: epidemiology from 1990 to 2017 and trends in 
2040.

Ben Abdelaziz A, Melki S, Nouira S, Ben Abdelaziz A, Khelil M, Azzaza M, Mokni 
M.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of cancers in terms of global burden of 
disease, incidence, prevalence and typology in the three Central Maghreb 
countries from 1990 to 2017, as well as their trends from 2017 to 2040.
METHODS: This is a descriptive and predictive study of the epidemiology of 
cancers in the Central Maghreb (Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) from 1990 to 2040. 
The epidemiological data: incidence, prevalence, specific mortality rate and 
Disability Adjusted Life Years were collected via the Global Burden of Disease 
Database created by the Institute of Heath Metrics and Evaluation. These 
parameters were expressed in terms per 100,000 inhabitants.
RESULTS: In 2017 and for the three Central Maghreb countries, cancers 
represented the second leading cause of death, with an overall specific 
mortality rate of 69/100,000 and an overall incidence rate of 116/100,000 
inhabitants. The Disability Adjusted Life Years rate varied from 1516/100,000 in 
Algeria to 1992/100,000 in Morocco. In the three Central Maghreb countries and 
during the year 2017, lung cancer was the first cancer in terms of mortality, 
regardless of age and sex, followed by colorectal cancer in Tunisia and breast 
cancer in Algeria and Morocco. These three cancers will remain in 2040 the most 
important in terms of mortality rate with lung cancer topping the list in 
Tunisia and Morocco with respective mortality rates of 30 and 16/100,000.
CONCLUSION: Cancers are currently, and in the next two decades, an important 
component of the GlobalBurden of Disease in Central Maghreb countries. The 
typology is dominated by lung, breast and colorectal cancers. The establishment 
of a Maghreb cancer registry would be a fundamental component of the Maghreb
