any hospital transfer were 56.1% and 45.4% of those with advanced dementia, 
77.6% and 69.5% of those with CHF, and 76.2% and 67.2% of those with COPD. The 
mean (SD) number of transfers per person-year alive for potentially avoidable 
conditions was higher in the 2011 cohort vs 2016 cohort: advanced dementia, 2.4 
(14.0) vs 1.6 (11.2) (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.81); CHF, 
8.5 (32.0) vs 6.7 (26.8) (aRR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.81); and COPD, 7.8 (30.9) vs 
5.5 (24.8) (aRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57-0.72). Transfers for bone fractures remained 
unchanged, and mortality did not increase. Hospice enrollment was low across all 
illness groups and years (range, 23%-30%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that concurrent 
with new initiatives aimed at reducing hospitalizations, hospital transfers 
declined between 2011 and 2017 among nursing home residents with advanced 
illnesses without increased mortality rates. Opportunities remain to further 
reduce unnecessary hospital transfers in this population and improve 
goal-directed care for those residents who opt to forgo hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: With the opioid crisis showing no sign of abating, strategies are 
needed to facilitate postoperative care for endocarditis related to injection 
drug use (IDU). The current standard, 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, yields 
frequent reoperation and IDU relapse. We examined the cost-effectiveness of 
inpatient drug rehabilitation (DR) postoperatively to optimize outcomes and 
costs.
METHODS: Two postoperative strategies were assessed: hospital-only care (HC) vs 
HC plus inpatient DR. Monte Carlo simulation evaluated effectiveness in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and cost per patient calculated over a 
20-year time horizon in 100,000 iterations. Willingness to pay was set to 
$100,000/QALY. To determine probabilities of continued postoperative IDU, 
recurrent infection, and death, best available evidence was combined with 
institutional data from IDU patients. Baseline probability of postoperative IDU 
was set to 35% after DR vs 60% after HC, and the cost of inpatient 
rehabilitation to $30,000.
RESULTS: Addition of inpatient DR to standard HC is the favorable strategy, with 
incremental per-patient cost of $36,920 and 0.93 QALYs gained over 20 years. 
Sensitivity analysis demonstrates DR is within our willingness-to-pay of 
$100,000/QALY if postoperative IDU is reduced by at least 7% (from 60% to 53%).
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of postoperative inpatient DR for IDU-related endocarditis 
is cost-effective even if only a modest reduction in IDU is achieved. 
Collaboration between hospitals and payors to launch pilot programs that provide 
postoperative addiction treatment and intravenous antibiotics after cardiac 
operations could dramatically improve endocarditis care.

CONTEXT: Clinicians often worry that patients' recognition of the terminal 
nature of their illness may impair psychological well-being.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if such recognition was associated with decrements to 
psychological well-being that persisted over time.
METHODS: About 87 patients with advanced cancer, with an oncologist-expected 
life expectancy of less than six months, were assessed before and after an 
oncology visit to discuss cancer restaging scan results and again at follow-up 
(median time between assessments, approximately six weeks). Prognostic 
understanding (PU) was assessed at previsit and postvisit, and a change score 
was computed. Psychological well-being was assessed at pre, post, and follow-up, 
and two change scores were computed (post minus pre; follow-up minus post).
RESULTS: Changes toward more accurate PU was associated with a corresponding 
initial decline in psychological well-being (r = -0.33; P < 0.01) but thereafter 
was associated with subsequent improvements (r = 0.40; P < 0.001). This pattern 
remained controlling for potential confounds. Patients showed different patterns 
of psychological well-being change (F = 3.07, P = 0.05; F = 6.54, P < 0.01): 
among patients with improved PU accuracy, well-being initially decreased but 
subsequently recovered; by contrast, among patients with stable PU accuracy, 
well-being remained relatively unchanged, and among patients with decrements in 
PU accuracy, well-being initially improved but subsequently declined.
CONCLUSION: Improved PU may be associated with initial decrements in 
psychological well-being, followed by patients rebounding to baseline levels. 
Concerns about lasting psychological harm may not need to be a deterrent to 
having prognostic discussions with patients.

Satisfactory results have been achieved with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty 
(UKA) for the treatment of isolated unicompartmental knee disease. However, UKA 
is associated with a significantly higher rate of revision. There is a tendency 
toward early revision of UKA for persistent pain because surgeons are not aware 
that outcomes can spontaneously improve with time. The aim of this study was to 
identify the time period that patients achieved the highest clinical outcomes 
following UKA. In total, we examined 72 knees that underwent Oxford UKA. We 
evaluated the range of motion and clinical results including Knee Society Knee 
Score, Knee Society Function Score (KSFS), and patient-reported scores using the 
Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 1, 2, and 3 years 
postoperatively. The extension angle showed significant recovery from 1 to 2 
years postoperatively, but no significant recovery was observed between 2 and 3 
years. The flexion angle at 2 years is larger than at 1 year. The KSFS at 3 
years is significantly lower than that at 1 year. The KOOS subscale of 
activities of daily living showed no significant differences among three periods 
after operation. The subscales of pain, symptom, sports, and quality of life 
showed significant recovery from 1 to 2 years postoperatively, but no 
significant recovery was observed from 2 to 3 years. To evaluate the 
effectiveness of Oxford UKA, surgeons should obtain clinical outcomes 2 years 
after the operation.

Does the Credit Cycle Have an Impact on Happiness?

The 2008 international financial crisis triggered a heated discussion of the 
relationship between public health and the economic environment. We test the 
relationship between the credit cycle and happiness using the fixed effects 
model and explore the transmission channels between them by adding the 
moderating effect. The results show the following empirical regularities. First, 
the credit cycle has a negative correlation with happiness. This means that 
credit growth will reduce the overall happiness score in a country/region. 
Second, the transmission channels between the credit cycle and happiness are 
different during credit expansion and recession. Life expectancy and generosity 
can moderate the relationship between the credit cycle and happiness only during 
credit expansion. GDP per capita can moderate this relationship only during 
credit recession. Social support, freedom, and positive affect can moderate this 
relationship throughout the credit cycle. Third, the total impact of the credit 
cycle on happiness will become positive by the changes in the moderating 
effects. In general, we can improve subjective well-being if one of the 
following five conditions holds: (1) with the adequate support from the family 
and society, (2) with enough freedom, (3) with social generosity, (4) with a 
positive and optimistic outlook, and (5) with a high level of GDP per capita.

Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.

This review focuses on mechanisms of calorie restriction (CR), particularly the 
growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis as an evolutionary 
conserved signal that regulates aging and lifespan, underlying the effects of CR 
in mammals. Topics include (1) the relation of the GH-IGF-1 signal with chronic 
low-level inflammation as one of the possible causative factors of aging, that 
is, inflammaging, (2) the isoform specificity of the forkhead box protein O 
(FoxO) transcription factors in CR-mediated regulation of cancer and lifespan, 
(3) the role for FoxO1 in the tumor-inhibiting effect of CR, (4) pleiotropic 
roles for FoxO1 in the regulation of disorders, and (5) sirtuin (Sirt) as a 
molecule upstream of FoxO. From the evolutionary view, the necessity of 
neuropeptide Y (Npy) for the effects of CR and the pleiotropic roles for Npy in 
life stages are also emphasized. Genes for mediating the effects of CR and 
regulating aging are context-dependent, particularly depending on nutritional 
states.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to explore the cost-effectiveness of 
Doctor to the Barrios (DTTB), a physician deployment program in the Philippines.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using decision tree models with a lifetime 
time horizon and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
SETTING: Societal and healthcare perspectives.
POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of children under 5 years in two provinces 
(Aklan and Nueva Ecija) and in a representative rural municipality.
PARTICIPANTS: None.
INTERVENTIONS: DTTB's impact on paediatric pneumonia and diarrhoea outcomes 
compared with a scenario without DTTB.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, effectiveness (in terms of lives saved and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: DTTB is cost-effective in the two provinces that were included in the 
study from societal and healthcare perspectives. Looking at a representative 
rural municipality, base case analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
suggest that DTTB has an ICER of 27 192 per QALY gained from a societal 
perspective. From a healthcare perspective, the base case ICER of DTTB is 
Philippine pesos (PHP) 71 839 per QALY gained and PHP 2 064 167 per life saved, 
and 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations produced similar average estimates. The cost 
per QALY of DTTB from a healthcare perspective is lower than the WHO recommended 
willingness-to-pay threshold of 100% of the country's per-capita gross domestic 
product.
CONCLUSIONS: DTTB can be a cost-effective intervention, but its value varies by 
setting and the conditions of the municipality where it is implemented. By 
focusing on a narrow set of paediatric outcomes, this study has likely 
underestimated the health benefits of DTTB. Additional research is needed to 
understand the full extent of DTTB's impact on the health of communities in 
rural and remote areas. Future cost-effectiveness analysis should empirically 
estimate various parameters and include other health conditions in addition to 
pneumonia and diarrhoea in children.

RNA structural conformation and dynamics govern the functional properties of all 
RNA/RNP. Accordingly, defining changes of RNA structure and dynamics in various 
conditions may provide detailed insight into how RNA structural properties 
regulate the function of RNA/RNP. Traditional chemical footprinting analysis 
using chemical modifiers allows to sample the dynamics and conformation 
landscape of diverse RNA/RNP. However, many chemical modifiers are limited in 
their capacity to provide unbiased information reflecting the in vivo RNA/RNP 
structural landscape. In the recent years, the development of 
selective-2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) methodology 
that uses powerful new chemical modifiers has significantly improved in vitro 
and in vivo structural probing of secondary and tertiary interactions of diverse 
RNA species at the single nucleotide level.Although the original discovery of 
Archaea as an independent domain of life is intimately linked to the 
technological development of RNA analysis, our understanding of in vivo RNA 
structural conformation and dynamics in this domain of life remains scarce.This 
protocol describes the in vivo use of SHAPE chemistry in two evolutionary 
divergent model Archaea, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Haloferax volcanii.

INTRODUCTION: With increased life expectancy, the desire to look younger has 
increased. Hence, many patients approach dermatologists for antiaging treatment. 
However, data regarding management of skin aging in India are scarce.
AIMS: To understand management patterns for skin aging among dermatologists in 
India.
METHODS: Overall, 147 Indian dermatologists were administered a 
questionnaire-based survey about patient characteristics, signs of skin aging, 
treatment options, and cost.
RESULTS: Among all the patients coming for dermatologists' consultation, 10%-40% 
were for antiaging treatment. About 70% dermatologists opined that majority of 
patients aged 30-40 years consulted for antiaging treatment, and the male to 
female ratio was 3:7. Approximately 46% of dermatologists felt that antiaging 
treatment should be initiated by the age of 30. Common signs of aging were 
wrinkles, pigmentation, dull skin or complexion, and dry skin. Based on 
patient's age and sex, dermatologists prescribed a combination of 2-4 products, 
which included antioxidants, retinoids, growth factors, and moisturizers. 
Improvement was assessed by photographic and clinical evaluation, and by 
patients' satisfaction (55%). Effect of the antiaging products was evident 
within 4-6 months. Earliest improvement was noted in dry skin and dull 
complexion. Average extent of improvement noted by 6 months was approximately 
20%-30%. The average monthly expenditure on antiaging treatments was 2000-4000 
INR.
CONCLUSION: Both men and women seek clinical treatment for skin aging in India. 
Dermatologists prescribe a combination of 2-4 products, including antioxidants, 
retinoids, growth factors, and moisturizers. Available antiaging therapies show 
an average improvement of up to 30% by 6 months.

Nutritional interventions, such as dietary or calorie restriction, are known to 
have a variety of health-promoting effects. The most impressive are the direct 
effects on life expectancy, which have been reproduced in many animal models. A 
variety of dietary restriction protocols have been described, which differ 
either in their macronutrient composition or in the time window for consumption. 
Mechanistically, the effects of dietary restriction are mediated mainly through 
signaling pathways that have central roles in the maintenance of cellular energy 
balance. Among these, target of rapamycin and insulin signaling appear to be the 
most important. Such nutritional interventions can have their effects in two 
different ways: either by direct interaction with the metabolism of the host 
organism, or by modulating the composition and performance of its endogenous 
microbiome. Various dietary restriction regimens have been identified that 
significantly alter the microbiome and thus profoundly modulate host metabolism. 
This review aims to discuss the mechanisms by which dietary restriction can 
affect life expectancy, and in particular the role of the microbiome.

Characterizing the Latent HIV-1 Reservoir in Patients with Viremia Suppressed on

Institute, National Institute of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, United States.

Modern combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can bring HIV-1 in blood plasma 
to level undetectable by standard tests, prevent the onset of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and allow a near-normal life expectancy for 
HIV-infected individuals. Unfortunately, cART is not curative, as within a few 
weeks of treatment cessation, HIV viremia in most patients rebounds to pre-cART 
levels. The primary source of this rebound, and the principal barrier to a cure, 
is the highly stable reservoir of latent yet replication-competent HIV-1 
proviruses integrated into the genomic DNA of resting memory CD4+ T cells. In 
this review, prevailing models for how the latent reservoir is established and 
maintained, residual viremia and viremic rebound upon withdrawal of cART, and 
the types and characteristics of cells harboring latent HIV-1 will be discussed. 
Selected technologies currently being used to advance our understanding of HIV 
latency will also be presented, as will a perspective on which areas of 
advancement are most essential for producing the next generation of HIV-1 
therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Adolescent tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) immunization 
helps prevent pertussis infection. Timing of Tdap receipt represents an 
important facet of successful adolescent pertussis immunization. Potential 
strategies for timing of vaccine administration are each associated with 
different benefits - including disease prevention - and costs. The objective of 
this study was to assess the cost-utility of adolescent pertussis immunization 
strategies in Canada.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a pertussis disease 
history-simulating Markov model, with adolescents (beginning at age 10 years) as 
the cohort of interest. The model assessed three Tdap vaccination strategies: 
(1) immunization of 10 year olds, (2) removal of adolescent vaccination, and (3) 
immunization of 14 year olds (status quo). The analysis was conducted from a 
healthcare payer perspective and used a lifetime time horizon. Primary outcomes 
included life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health system costs, 
and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs and outcomes were 
discounted at 1.5 percent annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The current recommended adolescent immunization strategy (at age 14) 
resulted in an average of 40.4432 expected QALYs and $26.28 per individual. This 
strategy was dominated by immunization at 10 years and no immunization. Compared 
to no immunization, immunizing adolescents at age 10 had an ICER of $74,899 per 
QALY. Results were most sensitive to the incidence of pertussis and the utility 
of moderate or severe pertussis. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
$50,000/QALY, removal of adolescent vaccination represented the most 
cost-effective strategy in 78% of simulations.
CONCLUSION: Analysis assumes a policy context where immunization of pregnant 
women is recommended. Findings suggest that alternate adolescent Tdap vaccine 
strategies - either immunization of 10 year olds, or removal of the adolescent 
vaccine - are more cost-effective than the current practice of immunizing 
14 year olds.

The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not 
necessarily represent the official positon of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention.
BACKGROUND: Continued indirect effects provided by the childhood pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]) program in 
the United States have decreased disease in the adult population, reducing the 
potential direct effects of vaccinating older adults.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuing to 
recommend PCV13 in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PPSV23) at age 65 compared to a strategy that only included a recommendation 
for PPSV23 at age 65.
METHODS: We used a probabilistic model following a cohort of 65 year olds in 
2019. We used vaccination coverage and disease incidence estimates for healthy 
adults and adults with chronic medical conditions. We incorporated continued 
indirect effects from the childhood PCV13 program on adult disease incidence.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, continuing to recommend PCV13 at age 65 cost 
$561,682 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In a scenario where 
PPSV23 provided modest protection against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, 
costs increased to $2.3 million per QALY. These estimates are larger than our 
prior estimates for cost-effectiveness of this recommendation in the context of 
predicted indirect effects due to new data indicating PCV13 provided limited 
impact on serotype 3, the major cause of the remaining PCV13-type disease. Under 
our prior assumptions about PCV13 effectiveness against serotype 3 disease, the 
cost of continuing the recommendation is $207,607 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Indirect effects from the childhood PCV13 program have dramatically 
increased the cost per QALY of continuing to recommend PCV13 at age 65 after 
only a few years.

OBJECTIVE: Describe patterns of cause of death by gender, age and territory. The 
causes of mortality and their possible relationships with health inequalities in 
the rural and urban population in Spain.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An ecological study of the mortality data of the Spanish 
population between 2007 and 2013 was carried out. Mortality data were obtained 
from the National Statistics Institute (INE). To be able to present the data in 
the grouped and simplified form, the ICD-10 classification detected by the INE 
was coded with the classification of Disease Load defined by Murray and López 
(1996), reduced to 21 categories of diseases. The territory variable has been 
determined: rural / urban, taking as a reference the cut that establishes that 
populations over 10,000 inhabitants are urban environments and those that are 
below rural environments. The chi-square test and the Bonferroni-corrected z 
test for qualitative factors and the Student's t-test for quantitative factors 
were considered.
RESULTS: The results showed than the main causes of death were cardiovascular 
diseases with 31% (844,010) and malignant tumors with 26.7% (724,889), 
neuropsychiatric with 8.8% (238,330) and respiratory with 8.7% (235,448). In the 
rural setting, for the male gender, 52.7% (366,053) died, while 51.3% (995,470) 
died in the urban environment. Regarding the female gender, the cases of deaths 
were 47.3% (329,063) in the rural environment and 48.7% (9545.188) in the urban. 
Related to age, the means of the ages associated with a later death were 
nutritional conditions with 85.62 years. As for the earliest ages, obviating 
those related to the deaths of newborns, were the congenital anomalies with 
25.37 years of means.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality differences were found between the 3axes of social 
inequality in health-age, gender and territory. Therefore, we can say that 
social determinants condition our life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Single fraction radiotherapy (SFR) is effective in palliation of 
symptoms related to advanced cancer. Despite this, several studies have shown 
that the trend towards multiple fraction treatment (MFR) is largely maintained. 
Even in patients with limited life expectancy, SFR is significantly 
underutilized in current practice.
CASES DESCRIPTION: Four patients diagnosed with advanced cancer who developed 
soft tissue lesions were treated with SFR due to frailty and/or a poor 
performance status.
CONCLUSION: Despite the effectiveness of SFR is well-established in BM, its use 
in symptoms caused by soft tissue lesions have been underreported. SFR could be 
a good option for providing palliation in some patients, particularly in those 
who are frail or have a poor performance status.

BACKGROUND: Persons with a diagnosis of severe mental illness have a life 
expectancy that is 20 years lower than the general population, and they are 
disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disorders. Improving the 
management of cardiovascular risk is one of the main challenges for the public 
health system. In the care pathway of persons with a diagnosis of severe mental 
illness, a better understanding of limiting and facilitating factors is 
required. The objective was to include persons with a diagnosis of severe mental 
illness, carers, and primary and mental health professionals in the creation and 
evaluation (feasibility) of a health promotion program designed to improve 
cardiovascular risk management through empowerment.
METHODS: This study combines a mixed methodology with qualitative and 
quantitative components. A multicenter prospective qualitative study was 
conducted in seven mental health units in France and was coordinated by a 
steering committee composed of persons with a diagnosis of severe mental 
illness, carers, and primary and mental health professionals.
RESULTS: This health promotion program must enable persons with a diagnosis of 
severe mental illness to assert their right to self-determination and to 
exercise greater control over their lives, beyond their diagnosis and care. 
Following a preliminary feasibility study, the effectiveness of this new tool 
will be evaluated using a randomized controlled trial in a second study.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings can be used by health organizations as a starting 
point for developing new and improved services for persons with a diagnosis of 
severe mental illness.Trial registration Clinical Trials Gov NCT03689296. Date 
registered September 28, 2018.

BACKGROUND: South Africa has the largest population of human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) realising the 
benefits of increased life expectancy. However, this population may be 
susceptible to cardiovascular disease (CVD) development, due to the chronic 
consequences of a lifestyle-related combination of risk factors, HIV infection 
and ART. We predicted a 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk in an HIV-infected 
population on long-term ART, based on their observed metabolic risk factor 
profile.
METHODS: We extracted data from hospital medical charts for 384 randomly 
selected HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 30 years. We defined metabolic syndrome 
(MetS) subcomponents using the International Diabetes Federation definition. A 
validated non-laboratory-based model for predicting a 10-year CVD mortality risk 
was applied and categorised into five levels, with the thresholds ranging from 
very low-risk (< 5%) to very high-risk scores (> 30%).
RESULTS: Among the 384 patients, with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 
42.90 ± 8.20 years, the proportion of patients that were overweight/obese was 
53.3%, where 50.9% had low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and 21 
(17.5%) had metabolic syndrome. A total of 144 patients with complete data 
allowed a definitive prediction of a 10-year CVD mortality risk. 52% (95% CI 
44-60) of the patients were stratified to very low risk (< 5%) compared to 8% 
(95% CI 4-13) that were at a very high risk (> 30%) of 10-year CVD mortality. 
The CVD risk grows with increasing age (years), 57.82 ± 6.27 among very high 
risk and 37.52 ± 4.50; p < 0.001 in very low risk patients. Adjusting for age 
and analysing CVD risk mortality as a continuous risk score, increasing duration 
of HIV infection (p = 0.002) and ART (p = 0.007) were significantly associated 
with increased predicted 10 year CVD mortality risk. However, there was no 
association between these factors and categorised CVD mortality risk as per 
recommended scoring thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in 10 HIV-infected patients is at very high risk of 
predicted 10-year CVD mortality in our study population. Like uninfected 
individuals, our study found increased age as a major predictor of 10-year 
mortality risk and high prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Additional CVD 
mortality risk due to the duration of HIV infection and ART was seen in our 
population, further studies in larger and more representative study samples are 
encouraged. It recommends an urgent need for early planning, prevention and 
management of metabolic risk factors in HIV populations, at the point of ART 
initiation.

In this study, the effect of rosemary extract in two free and encapsulated forms 
to increase the shelf life of beef meat during a 28-day refrigerated storage 
period was investigated. For this purpose, rosemary was extracted using 
different extraction methods including ultrasound, solvent, and supercritical 
fluid extraction. The amount of phenolic compounds, antioxidant properties (free 
radical scavenging capacity of DPPH radical, ferric reducing antioxidant power), 
and antimicrobial activity of rosemary extract against pathogenic bacteria were 
evaluated. According to the results, the highest amount of phenolic compounds, 
antioxidant, and antimicrobial activity was observed in rosemary extracted by 
ultrasound method that used for next study (p < .05). In order to encapsulation 
of the rosemary extract, basil seed gum and soybean protein isolate separately 
and in combination form (1:1 w:w ratio) were used as carriers. Based on the 
particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency tests, the best 
carriers were soybean protein isolate that used as a carrier for encapsulation. 
Then, to investigate the effect of rosemary extract to increase the shelf life 
of beef meat, 5 treatments including control, rosemary extract with 
concentrations of 800 ppm and 1,600 ppm, and nano-capsulation form of it with 
800 ppm and 1,600 ppm concentrations were selected and they were periodically 
evaluated for chemical and microbial analysis (peroxide value, Thiobarbituric 
acid, color index, pH, and total viable count). The results showed that rosemary 
extract has an antimicrobial and antioxidant properties which could increasingly 
delay microbial spoilage and lipid oxidation of beef meat fillets, 
nano-capsulation form of rosemary could increase these qualities. The best 
results were observed in nano-capsulation of rosemary extract with 1,600 ppm 
(p < .05) as well as increased the shelf life of fillets till 21st day. 
Therefore, it seems that encapsulated rosemary extract could be used as a 
natural preservative in beef meat and meat products.

We investigated the effects of chitosan-based coatings on the preservation 
quality of refrigerated Chinese shrimp for 12 days. Samples of Chinese shrimp 
were subjected to three different coating treatments, namely chitosan (CH), 
chitosan and ε-polylysine (CH + ε-PL), chitosan combined with ε-polylysine and 
carrageenan (CH + ε-PL + CA), and compared with a control. The bacteriological 
characteristics [total viable count (TVC)], chemical indexes including pH, 
thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, K-value, and total volatile basic nitrogen 
(TVB-N), texture (hardness, chewiness, and elasticity), and sensory changes were 
assessed. The increases in TVC, pH, TBA, K-value, and TVB-N were observed to be 
delayed by preservation treatments, and the textural and sensory characteristics 
indicated that the treated shrimp were preserved more effectively than the 
control. Treatment with chitosan combined with ε-polylysine and carrageenan was 
the most effective preservation method than treatment with chitosan alone or 
chitosan and ε-polylysine; the shelf life was also prolonged. Therefore, 
treatment with chitosan combined with ε-polylysine and carrageenan is proposed 
as a potential method for shelf life extension of Chinese shrimp for 
refrigerated storage.

PREMISE: Heterogeneity of biodiversity data from the collections, research, and 
management communities presents challenges for data findability, accessibility, 
interoperability, and reusability. Workflows designed with data collection, 
standards, dissemination, and reuse in mind will generate better information 
across geopolitical, administrative, and institutional boundaries. Here, we 
present our data workflow as a case study of how we collected, shared, and used 
data from multiple sources.
METHODS: In 2012, we initiated the collection of biodiversity data relating to 
Michigan prairie fens, including data on plant communities and the federally 
endangered Poweshiek skipperling (Oarisma poweshiek).
RESULTS: Over 23,000 occurrence records were compiled in a database following 
Darwin Core standards. The records were linked with media and biological, 
chemical, and geometric measurements. We published the data as Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility data sets and in Symbiota SEINet portals.
DISCUSSION: We highlight data collection techniques that optimized transcription 
time, including the use of predetermined and controlled vocabulary, Darwin Core 
terms, and data dictionaries. The validity and longevity of our data were 
supported by voucher specimens, metadata with measurement records, and published 
manuscripts detailing methods and data sets. Key to our data dissemination was 
cooperation among partners and the utilization of dynamic tools. To increase 
data interoperability, we need flexible and customizable data collection 
templates, coding, and enhanced communication among communities using 
biodiversity data.

Maize yellow mosaic virus (MaYMV; genus Polerovirus; family Luteoviridae) was 
recently characterized from maize in China and subsequently detected in mixed 
infection with sugarcane mosaic virus (genus Potyvirus; family Potyviridae) in
