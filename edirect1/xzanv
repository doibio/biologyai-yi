OBJECT: Several major randomized controlled trials of carotid endarterectomy 
(CEA) in patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis 
have addressed the net effects of CEA on the risk of stroke. However, because 
the risk of stroke among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is 
relatively low, whether to treat their stenosis with CEA remains an important 
public health issue.
METHODS: The authors constructed a Markov model to evaluate the effectiveness of 
CEA. In modeling 4 health states, the probability of transition to another state 
was estimated using data from major randomized controlled trials. Adopting 3 
comorbidity index values for baseline analyses, the authors expressed outcomes 
in terms of the expected number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a 
hypothetical cohort undergoing CEA and another without treatment.
RESULTS: In the authors' baseline analysis, CEA for asymptomatic stenosis 
yielded a very small benefit (0.07 QALY) for 70-year-old, normal-risk CEA 
candidates. Benefits decreased further, often becoming negative, as patient age, 
surgical risk, or comorbidity index increased. In patients with symptomatic 
stenosis, CEA was always more effective than conservative management, even 
considering variables such as comorbidities limiting life expectancy, advanced 
age, and increased perioperative risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy for severe carotid stenosis consistently and 
significantly benefits patients with recent symptoms. However, surgery for 
asymptomatic stenosis appears justified only in carefully selected conditions: 
low treatment risks in relatively young individuals without any comorbidities.

Dosing of antipsychotics in schizophrenia across the life-spectrum.

Age effects on dosing of antipsychotics in schizophrenia and mechanisms 
underlying those effects have not been well understood. The objective of this 
article is to review the literature regarding effects of age on antipsychotic 
dosing in schizophrenia and potential mechanisms underlying the age-related 
antipsychotic sensitivity. According to prescription surveys, age appears to 
have biphasic effects on prescribed antipsychotic dose. The dose increased with 
age through the third decade, subsequently plateaued, and decreased after the 
fifth decade. The first half of this inverted U-shaped relationship may be 
attributable to a deterioration process in the early phase of schizophrenia and 
the contribution of 'tachyphylaxis' of antipsychotics on the dopaminergic 
system. The following age-related decline in prescribed dose is likely 
associated with physiological aging. Recent data suggest that this increased 
antipsychotic sensitivity with age comes from age-related functional decline in 
the dopaminergic system, including endogenous dopamine level and dopamine 
receptor density. Although the evidence on potential mechanisms underlying age 
effects on antipsychotic dosing is still limited, alterations in the 
dopaminergic system due to aging and chronic exposure to this drug may 
contribute to the inverted U-shaped relationship between dose and age. This 
age-related antipsychotic sensitivity highlights the importance of finding the 
lowest possible effective dose of antipsychotic drugs as patients age to enhance 
therapeutic effects as well as minimize their side effects.

Hospital, USA. basem_jamal@yahoo.com

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by weakness and 
fatigability of skeletal muscles, with improvement following rest. The disease 
was so named because of a frequently fatal outcome. As recently as 30 years ago, 
25% of patients with MG died of the disease. Treatment advances have 
dramatically changed the expected outcome, and with appropriate therapy, most 
patients with MG can now lead normal lives and have a relatively normal life 
expectancy. In this article we review the pathophysiology of MG, its signs and 
symptoms, treatment, the perioperative evaluation and preparation for surgery, 
and the anesthetic consideration to enable clinicians better understand this 
disease entity and provide guidance in diagnosis and care of patients with MG.

Natural history of feeding-tube use in nursing home residents with advanced 
dementia.

Author information:
(1)The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, 
USA.

OBJECTIVES: Despite the evidence that feeding-tube use in persons with advanced 
dementia is not associated with improved outcomes, there remains striking 
variation in their use. Yet, little is known about the national incidence of 
feeding-tube insertions, the circumstances of their insertion, and 
post-insertion health care use.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of Minimum Data Set merged onto Medicare Claims 
Files.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents (NHR) without a feeding tube.
MEASUREMENTS: NHR were followed for up to 1 year to see whether a feeding tube 
was inserted and then followed for 1 year after insertion to examine health care 
use and survival.
RESULTS: The incidence of feeding-tube insertion was 53.6/1000 residents. Most 
(68.1%) feeding-tube insertions were performed in an acute care hospital with 
the most common reasons for admission being pneumonia, dehydration, and 
dysphagia. One year post-insertion mortality was 64.1% with median survival of 
56 days. Within 1 year, 19.3% of those who had a feeding tube inserted required 
a tube replacement or repositioning within a median 145 days after the initial 
insertion. Over 1 year, tube feeding was associated with an average of 9.1 
hospitalized days per person, 1.0 hospitalizations, 0.3 emergency room visits 
that did not result in a hospital admission.
CONCLUSION: Most feeding tubes are inserted in an acute care hospital. 
Feeding-tube insertions are also associated with poor survival and significant 
rate of health care use after insertion.

BACKGROUND: During the first three decades of the 21st century the combination 
of increasing life expectancy and falling birth rates will result in substantial 
demographic changes within the population of the United Kingdom. A large 
increase in the elderly population is likely to have significant effects on the 
number of patients who sustain a hip fracture.
AIM: To predict future changes in hip fracture burden in Scotland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was obtained from the Scottish Hip Fracture Audit 
database for a 12 month period between April 2004 and March 2005. All 
orthopaedic units in Scotland participated in the audit during this period. This 
data was used to calculate the incidence of hip fracture by 5 year age/gender 
cohorts. Outcome data was analysed in a similar manner. Population prediction 
data obtained from the Registrar General's Office was then used to predict hip 
fracture numbers for the year 2031. Two separate prediction models were used. 
The first model assumed that the age/gender specific incidence of hip fracture 
observed in 2004 would remain constant. Between 1999 and 2004, a 9.6% decrease 
in the population incidence of hip fracture was observed. Therefore a second 
prediction model was used which assumed a continuation in the fall in population 
incidence of hip fracture between 2004 and 2031.
RESULTS: The population aged 50 years and above is predicted to increase 28% by 
2031, with the most significant increases occurring in the over 1980s. The 
number of hip fractures is predicted to rise by 45% to 75% (from 6164 to 
8829-10756 cases per annum) requiring an additional 287-474 hospital beds. By 
2031 approximately 45% of fractures will occur in those aged 85 years and above, 
compared to 34% in 2004. Predicted changes in population demographics are highly 
variable by region and so local planning of resource provision will be 
essential.
CONCLUSION: Changes in population demographics will have significant 
implications for health care provision for the care of hip fracture patients. An 
increase in the capacity of acute orthopaedic care and a review of care models 
will be required to ensure adequate resource provision.

George's Hospital NHS Trust, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVES: Deep venous thromboses (DVTs) are a significant cause of morbidity 
and mortality in the general and inpatient population. Current anticoagulation 
therapy is efficient in reducing thrombus propagation but does not contribute to 
clot lysis or prevention of post-thrombotic limb syndrome. Catheter directed 
thrombolysis (CDT) is an alternative method for treating DVTs but there is no 
consensus regarding indications for its use.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Cochrane library were searched for all articles on deep 
vein thrombosis and thrombolysis.
REVIEW METHOD: Articles presenting data on DVT thrombolysis, DVT 
anticoagulation, mechanical thrombectomy, venous stenting and May-Thurner's 
syndrome were considered for inclusion in the review.
RESULTS: CDT reduced clot burden, DVT recurrence and may prevent the formation 
of post-thrombotic syndrome. Indications for its use include younger individuals 
with a long life expectancy and few co-morbidities, limb-threatening thromboses 
and proximal ilio-femoral DVTs. There is a marked lack of randomised controlled 
trials comparing CDT-related mortality and long term outcomes compared to 
anticoagulation alone. The effectiveness of combined pharmaco-mechanic 
thrombectomy, although promising, need to be further investigated, as is the 
role of caval filters in preventing DVT-associated pulmonary emboli.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the outcome of CDT in DVT management are 
encouraging in selected patient cohorts, but further evidence is required to 
establish longer term benefits and cost-effectiveness.

12000, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.

AIMS: To evaluate the posthepatectomy survival of uveal melanoma patients with 
liver metastases.
METHODS: Data were collected from the files in the Departments of Ophthalmology, 
General Surgery and Oncology, for uveal melanoma patients who were seen in the 
Ocular Oncology Clinic at the Hadassah Medical Center from 1988 to 2007. The 
main outcome was posthepatectomy survival. Statistical analysis was performed 
using JMP statistical software.
RESULTS: Of the 558 patients, 74 (13%) developed metastases after a median of 
35.0 months from the initial diagnosis. Thirty-five patients underwent 
hepatectomy. These patients had similar clinical characteristics as those who 
did not undergo hepatectomy. The median survival time from the detection of 
metastasis was 3.7-fold higher in the operated patients in comparison with the 
non-operated patients. Posthepatectomy survival of patients who were found in 
surgery to have 1-5 metastatic nodules was 3.1 times longer than those with six 
or more lesions. The hepatectomies of 13 patients resulted in complete resection 
of the hepatic metastases with clean histological margins (R0). These patients 
survived 1.9 times longer than those with residual disease (R1/R2).
CONCLUSION: It is possible to extend significantly the life expectancy of uveal 
melanoma patients who develop isolated hepatic metastases by complete resection 
of the lesions.

Comment in
    J Am Board Fam Med. 2009 May-Jun;22(3):239-41.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-specific mortality is projected to be only 1% in 15 years in 
approximately 75% of patients with screen-detected localized prostate cancer 
(LPC). Nearly 94% of patients choose treatment even though treatment damages 
health-related quality of life. No data are available regarding what survival 
benefit patients expected from treatment.
OBJECTIVES: A self-administered mailed survey was sent to 184 men with newly 
diagnosed LPC to query patients about expected survival with treatment versus 
observation.
RESULTS: More than 90% of patients had at least a high school education and a 
ninth-grade health literacy. In addition, 68% patients had income of > or 
=$50,000. Mean cancer grade was 6.6. Twenty-three patients chose observation and 
161 patients chose surgery or radiotherapy. Mean comorbidity adjusted life 
expectancy (CALE) without the cancer was 22.9 years. Without cancer treatment, 
15.2% of patients expected to live <5 years, 48.8% 5 to 10 years, 33.5% 11 to 19 
years, and 2.4% > or =20 years. With treatment, survival expectations were <5 
years in 0.6%, 5 to 10 years in 6.5%, 11 to 19 years in 30.0%, and > or =20 
years in 62.9% of patients. Age, prostate-specific antigen level, CALE, anxiety, 
depression, and social support were factors that predicted differences between 
CALE and patient survival expectations with and without treatment.
CONCLUSION: LPC patients grossly underestimated their life expectancy without 
treatment and grossly overestimated the survival benefit of treatment.

Effect of beta2-adrenergic receptor polymorphism in asthma control of patients 
receiving combination treatment.

(1)Department of Allergy and Rheumatology, Ajou University School of Medicine, 
Yeongtong-Gu, Suwon, Korea.

PURPOSE: Combination treatment of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting 
beta2-agonist (LABA) is widely used as a maintenance regimen for the management 
of asthma. This study evaluated the effect of the beta2-adrenergic receptor 
(ADRB2) polymorphism on lung function and asthma control with regular use of 
combination treatment of an inhaled ICS plus LABA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 43 Korean asthmatics who were symptomatic despite regular 
ICS use for at least 3 months were enrolled. For a 2-week run-in period, they 
received ICS (budesonide 800 microg/day) plus terbutaline (5 microg prn). as 
needed. During the 24-week active treatment period, they received budesonide 160 
microg and formoterol 4.5 microg b.i.d. as maintenance and rescue medication. 
Pulmonary function and quality of life scores were monitored every 8 weeks; 
morning/evening peak expiratory flow meter (PEFR) was recorded daily. Patients 
were genotyped for ADRB2 Arg16Gly using single base extension methodology.
RESULTS: During the run-in period, there were no significant between-group 
differences in lung function; after 8 weeks of active treatment, Arg/Arg 
patients had significantly higher forced expiratory volume in 1 secord (FEV(1)) 
and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) (p = 0.023 and p = 0.021, respectively), 
and better asthma control and quality of life after 24 weeks (p = 0.016 and p = 
0.028, respectively). During treatment, there was a greater improvement in 
morning/evening PEFR in Arg/Arg patients.
CONCLUSION: Asthmatic patients with the Arg/Arg genotype at codon 16 of ADRB2 
achieve better asthma control with long-term regular use of combined budesonide 
and formoterol treatment, suggesting that the ADRB2 genotype may dictate choice 
of treatment strategy.

AIM: The aim of this report is to describe the restorative treatment of an 
18-year-old patient diagnosed with autosomal recessive hypocalcified-hypoplastic 
amelogenesis imperfecta (AI).
BACKGROUND: Esthetic and functional rehabilitations in AI cases are challenging 
and should consider individual aspects, such as age, socioeconomic status, AI 
type, and intraoral condition.
REPORT: AI was diagnosed in an 18-year-old patient.
SUMMARY: Considering the short length of crowns and roots, patient life 
expectancy, minimal invasiveness, amount of treatment time required, and lower 
costs, oral rehabilitation with overdentures provided an adequate functional and 
esthetic rehabilitation of the patient.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This report demonstrated overdentures to be a viable, 
relatively inexpensive, and non-invasive treatment choice of a patient with AI 
with concerns about treatment longevity, invasiveness, cost, esthetics, and 
long-term maintenance.

Infectious Disease Control Netherlands, National Institute for Public Health and

The calculation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) enables public health 
policy makers to compare the burden of disease of a specific disease with that 
of other (infectious) diseases. The incidence of a disease is important for the 
calculation of DALYs. To estimate the incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis 
(CT), a random sample of 10,008 dried blood spot filter paper cards from babies 
born in 2006 in the Netherlands were tested for Toxoplasma gondii-specific IgM 
antibodies. Eighteen samples were confirmed as positive for IgM, resulting in an 
observed birth incidence of CT of 1.8 cases per 1,000 live-born children in 2006 
and an adjusted incidence of 2.0 cases per 1,000. This means that 388 infected 
children were born in 2006. The most likely burden of disease is estimated to be 
2,300 DALYs (range 820-6,710 DALYs). In the previous calculations, using data 
from a regional study from 1987, this estimate was 620 DALYs (range 220-1,900 
DALYs). The incidence of CT in the Netherlands is much higher than previously 
reported; it is 10 times higher than in Denmark and 20 times higher than in 
Ireland, based on estimates obtained using the same methods. There is no 
screening program in the Netherlands; most children will be born asymptomatic 
and therefore will not be detected or treated.

Lamotrigine extends lifespan but compromises health span in Drosophila 
melanogaster.

The discovery of life extension in Caenorhabditis elegans treated with 
anticonvulsant medications has raised the question whether these drugs are 
prospective anti-aging candidate compounds. The impact of these compounds on 
neural modulation suggests that they might influence the chronic diseases of 
aging as well. Lamotrigine is a commonly used anticonvulsant with a relatively 
good adverse-effects profile. In this study, we evaluated the interaction 
between the impacts of lamotrigine on mortality rate, lifespan, metabolic rate 
and locomotion. It has been proposed in a wide range of animal models that there 
is an inverse relationship between longevity, metabolic rate, and locomotion. We 
hypothesized that the survival benefits displayed by this compound would be 
associated with deleterious effects on health span, such as depression of 
locomotion. Using Drosophila as our model system, we found that lamotrigine 
decreased mortality and increased lifespan in parallel with a reduction in 
locomotor activity and a trend towards metabolic rate depression. Our findings 
underscore the view that assessing health span is critical in the pursuit of 
useful anti-aging compounds.

New techniques for the treatment of valvular aortic stenosis--transcatheter 
aortic valve implantation with the SAPIEN heart valve.

Acquired aortic stenosis (AS) resulting from calcification of the aortic valve 
is the most frequent acquired valve disease in Europe. Due to the increasing 
average life expectancy the population in the western industrial world is aging, 
and consequently the prevalence of AS requiring aortic valve replacement (AVR), 
particularly in older patients, is continuously increasing. However, the risk of 
conventional AVR with the use of sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and 
cardioplegic cardiac arrest is obviously higher in the elderly patient, in whom 
significant comorbidities may additionally pre-exist. Moreover, there is recent 
evidence that 30-40% of the patients with severe and/or symptomatic AS in Europe 
remain untreated and nearly half of them are considered "too sick" for surgery. 
Thus, there seems to be a role for less invasive treatment options, like 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) techniques, addressing an unmet 
patient and medical need. Today, an increasing number of different transcatheter 
heart valve devices for aortic valve implantation is coming up; however, so far 
only for two systems there is broad clinical experience with human 
implantations. The following article is aimed to describe the current 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation technique with full details of the 
procedural steps, both via the transfemoral and via the transapical access using 
the balloon-expandable SAPIEN transcatheter aortic heart valve device.

Diurnal analysis of database (n=5223) on myocardial infarction in Syktyvkar for 
1998-2006 has revealed the following regularities. All phase extremes of the 
Moon, including new moon, are accompanied in men and women by the reliable 
growing of the myocardial infarction number by 25-35%. "Age" of myocardial 
infarction in men is less than that in women by 10 years. This factor complies 
with the gender difference in the average life expectancy in the region. Men 
have myocardial infarction oftener than women by 1.7 times. The critical month 
for development of the myocardial infarction in both sexes is June.

[Signal (nondestructive) role of environment in aging].

[Article in Russian]

Khaliavkin AV, Iashin AI.

Adequate pattern of gene activity due to positive environmental influences of 
natural niches can enhance the resistance of organisms and reduce their aging. 
But the life expectancy in nature is much below (due to high external mortality) 
than in laboratory conditions. Some mutated genes, modified products of which 
are involved in regulatory control circuits, can (in some cases) mistakenly 
transform inadequate external cues of artificial experimental conditions to the 
regular reaction of an organism on the quite natural environment. This will lead 
to significant life span extension of laboratory animals. On the other hand, 
several lines of evidence suggest that the suitable signal simulating natural 
one, sent in appropriate time to the proper place, can also increase life span, 
but without change of a genetic design.

[Longevity extension by specific inhibition of pI3K in Drosophila melanogaster].

[Article in Russian]

Moskalev AA, Shaposhnikov MV.

Mutational decreasing of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade genes function 
leads to a life span increase in a lot of model organisms. However the 
geroprotector effect of pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has not yet been 
studied. In this connection, we analyzed life span of D. melanogaster wild type 
laboratory strain Canton-S after treatment by LY-294002 (5 microM), that is a 
specific inhibitor of PI3K at preimaginal stages of development and imago. It is 
shown that imago feeding by LY-294002 results in lifespan increase. The median 
lifespan increases by 14% in males and by 14.3% in females, the maximal--by 
22.5% in males, and by 16.3% in females. The obtained results demonstrate that

OBJECTIVE: To assess the comparative health and economic outcomes associated 
with three alternative first-trimester abortion techniques in Mexico City and to 
examine the policy implications of increasing access to safe abortion modalities 
within a restrictive setting.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Mexico City.
POPULATION: Reproductive-aged women with unintended pregnancy seeking 
first-trimester abortion.
METHODS: Synthesising the best available data, a computer-based model simulates 
induced abortion and its potential complications and is used to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of alternative safe modalities for first-trimester pregnancy 
termination: (1) hospital-based dilatation and curettage (D&C), (2) 
hospital-based manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), (3) clinic-based MVA and (4) 
medical abortion using vaginal misoprostol.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of complications, lifetime costs, life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy.
RESULTS: In comparison to the magnitude of health gains associated with all safe 
abortion modalities, the relative differences between strategies were more 
pronounced in terms of their economic costs. Assuming all options were equally 
available, clinic-based MVA was the least costly and most effective. Medical 
abortion with misoprostol provided comparable benefits to D&C, but cost 
substantially less. Enhanced access to safe abortion was always more influential 
than shifting between safe abortion modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the provision of safe abortion is 
cost-effective and will result in reduced complications, decreased mortality and 
substantial cost savings compared with unsafe abortion. In Mexico City, shifting 
from a practice of hospital-based D&C to clinic-based MVA and enhancing access 
to medical abortion will have the best chance to minimise abortion-related 
morbidity and mortality.

Regression on quantile residual life.

North Carolina 27710, USA.

A time-specific log-linear regression method on quantile residual lifetime is 
proposed. Under the proposed regression model, any quantile of a time-to-event 
distribution among survivors beyond a certain time point is associated with 
selected covariates under right censoring. Consistency and asymptotic normality 
of the regression estimator are established. An asymptotic test statistic is 
proposed to evaluate the covariate effects on the quantile residual lifetimes at 
a specific time point. Evaluation of the test statistic does not require 
estimation of the variance-covariance matrix of the regression estimators, which 
involves the probability density function of the survival distribution with 
censoring. Simulation studies are performed to assess finite sample properties 
of the regression parameter estimator and test statistic. The new regression 
method is applied to a breast cancer data set with long-term follow-up to 
estimate the patients' median residual lifetimes, adjusting for important 
prognostic factors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate that it is feasible and 
recommendable to present value of information (VOI) outcomes in terms of 
underlying costs and effects in addition to costs alone.
METHODS: The benefits of collecting additional information on health economic 
outcomes before deciding on a preferred policy when evaluating alternative 
strategies with uncertain outcomes are quantified in a VOI analysis. In general, 
costs and effects are combined into one single dimension to determine the 
expected monetary VOI. Separate information on costs and effects is lost. This 
information, however, remains relevant to the decision-maker. The concept of the 
attributable VOI (AVOI) is introduced which enables separate presentation of 
expected changes in health outcomes and costs.
RESULTS: The use of the attributable expected value of perfect information is 
illustrated with a few examples. These examples demonstrate the benefits of the 
new approach, as well as its calculation. The benefits are: 1) insight into the 
expected costs and expected effects gained as a result of carrying out further 
research to reduce or eliminate decision uncertainty; and 2) the likelihood that 
the outcome of additional research will result in a change in preferred policy.
CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making may be enhanced and clarified by adding results 
from AVOI analyses. Obtaining these results is straightforward and requires only 
a minimal computational effort. Therefore, use of the AVOI extension is 
recommended for all future VOI analyses.

Street, MCSB1530, Mobile, AL 36617, USA. amabien@usouthal.edu

PURPOSE: To familiarize primary care providers (PCPs) with the 
pathophysiological processes, diagnostic evaluation, and medical management of 
sickle hemoglobinopathies and their complications. Current standards of care, 
clinical research advances, and new treatment options will also be addressed to 
assist PCPs in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD).
DATA SOURCES: A selective search and review of the current literature on SCD and 
the authors' experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Management of individuals with SCD is very complex, requiring a 
multidisciplinary approach that includes the patient or parent, PCP, specialist, 
nurse, and social worker. More patients living with SCD are relying on PCPs in 
nonspecialty practices for comprehensive disease management.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Newborn screening detects new cases of SCD annually. 
The median life expectancy has more than doubled for individuals with sickle 
cell anemia. Healthcare providers are now in an era of increased routine 
screening, assessment, and management of chronic complications from this illness 
not previously seen in the care of adults with SCD.

The payoff time: a flexible framework to help clinicians decide when patients 
with comorbid disease are not likely to benefit from practice guidelines.

    Med Care. 2009 Jun;47(6):607-9.

BACKGROUND: Practice guidelines rarely consider comorbid illness, and resulting 
overuse of health services may increase costs without conferring benefit.
OBJECTIVE: To individualize a framework for inferring when patients with 
comorbid illness are not likely to benefit from colorectal cancer screening 
guidelines.
METHODS: We modified the "payoff time" framework (the minimum time until a 
guideline's cumulative benefits exceed its cumulative harms) to increase its 
applicability to a wide range of primary care patients. We show how it may 
inform colorectal (CR) cancer screening decisions for 3 typical patients in 
general practice for whom CR screening would be recommended by current 
guidelines: (1) 60-year-old man with diabetes, congestive heart failure, lung 
disease, stroke, and substantial frailty; (2) 60-year-old woman with diabetes 
and obesity, without other comorbidity or frailty; and (3) 50-year-old woman 
with inflammatory bowel disease.
RESULTS: For patient 1, the payoff time for CR screening (minimum time until 
benefits exceed harms) is 7.3 years, and for patient 2, the payoff time for CR 
screening is 5.4 years. Evidence is insufficient to estimate the payoff time for 
patient 3. Because patient 1's estimated life expectancy is 3.7 years (less than 
his payoff time), he is unlikely to benefit from CR screening. Because patient 
2's estimated life expectancy exceeds 10 years (greater than her payoff time), 
she may benefit from CR screening. Because evidence is insufficient to estimate 
the payoff time for patient 3, the payoff time framework does not inform 
decision making.
CONCLUSION: The payoff time framework may identify patients for whom particular 
clinical guidelines are unlikely to confer benefit, and has the potential to 
decrease unnecessary health care.

Modeling ranking, time trade-off, and visual analog scale values for EQ-5D 
health states: a review and comparison of methods.

BACKGROUND: There is rising interest in eliciting health state valuations using 
rankings. Due to their relative simplicity, ordinal measurement methods may 
offer an attractive practical alternative to cardinal methods, such as time 
trade-off (TTO) and visual analog scale (VAS). In this article, we explore 
alternative models for estimating cardinal health state values from rank 
responses in a unique multicountry database. We highlight an estimation 
challenge pertaining to health states just below perfect health (the "nonoptimal 
gap") and propose an analytic solution to ameliorate this problem.
METHODS: Using a standardized protocol developed by the EuroQol Group, rank, 
VAS, and TTO responses were collected for 43 health states in 8 countries: 
Slovenia, Argentina, Denmark, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, and 
United States, yielding a sample of 179,431 state responses from 11,483 
subjects. States were described using the EQ-5D system, which allows for 3 
different possible levels on 5 different dimensions of health. We estimated 
conditional logit and probit regression models for rank responses. The 
regressions included 17 health state attribute variables reflecting specific 
levels on each dimension and counts of different levels across dimensions. This 
flexible specification accommodates previously published valuation models, such 
as models applied in the United Kingdom and United States. In addition to 
fitting standard conditional logit and probit models, which assume equal 
variance across health states (homoscedasticity), we examined a heteroscedastic 
probit model that assumes no variance for the 2 points anchoring the scale 
("optimal health" and "dead") and relaxes the equal-variance assumption for all 
other states. Rank-based predictions for the 243 unique states defined by the 
EQ-5D system were compared with predictions from conventional linear models 
fitted to TTO and VAS responses.
RESULTS: By construction, the TTO and VAS models assume no variance around the 
anchoring states of optimal health and dead. Mimicking this assumption in the 
probit rank models helps dissolve the nonoptimal gap. For all other states, 
variances in TTO and VAS were negatively associated with mean values, which 
contradict the assumption of homoscedasticity. Estimated health state values 
from the heteroscedastic probit model for the ranking data were highly 
correlated with predictions from both TTO and VAS models for the 243 EQ-5D 
states. Between VAS and rank-based estimates, Lin's rho, a measure of agreement, 
was over 0.98 with a mean absolute difference of 0.028. Corresponding measures 
of agreement between rank and TTO estimates were 0.96 and 0.12, which is similar 
to the agreement between VAS and TTO.
CONCLUSIONS: Rank-based valuation techniques, which offer advantages of 
flexibility, generalizability, and ease of administration, may be attractive 
substitutes for TTO and VAS in the measurement of societal values for health 
outcomes.

Despite the tremendous efforts undertaken by the government of Mali, health 
indicators for morbidity and mortality are still high. The global mortality rate 
of 13 per thousand and the low life expectancy are the main enhancing factors 
for such phenomenon. This study was undertaken in public, private and 
Para-public and community health structures as well as confessional and 
faith-based health organizations in commune II of the district of Bamako. Our 
evaluation was based on the Avedis Donavedian method for health services 
quality. It was a transversal study based on nursery care in the structures 
above cited. The procedures for this study consisted of passive observance of 
nursery care with retrospective collection of data on the technical practices of 
the health workers in the services offered. The results showed a higher deficit 
in term of incomplete technical practice, physical and psychic respect of 
patients in faith-based organizations than in other health structures. There 
were no written guidelines for preventing nosocomial infections, injections 
security, management of waste and hazards, prevention and treatment of wounds. 
There was a lack of adapted sterilization materials in most of the CSCOM and 
private structures. Most of the injections and treatment of wounds were done by 
assistant nurses and midwives. Moreover, the utilization rate of nonsterile 
syringes and pins between 5.3 and 13.6% in the population studied. In 
conclusion, there is no security in nursery care in most of the health 
structures of the Commune II in the district of Bamako.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the lifetime potential benefits and cost-effectiveness 
of using 64 multidetector-row computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) as 
a noninvasive imaging modality for patients at risk for coronary artery disease 
(CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision and cost-effective analysis using a Markov model 
was performed to compare 4 strategies: (1) no examination, (2) routine coronary 
angiography (CAG), (3) CTCA, or (4) medication without CAG or CTCA in persons at 
risk for stable CAD. Compared with the no examination and no treatment 
strategies, CTCA gained 0.551 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$15,581 (in 2007) per QALY. 
Routine CAG gained 0.012 QALYs compared with the CTCA strategy, with an ICER of 
US$445,276 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Using CTCA as the first-line examination for 60-year-old men at 
risk for stable CAD achieved gains of QALY comparable to that of routine CAG, 
but at a lower cost.

COPD.

OBJECTIVE: To review published evidence regarding the cost effectiveness of 
multi-component COPD programs and to illustrate how potentially cost effective 
programs can be identified.
METHODS: Systematic search of Medline and Cochrane databases for evaluations of 
multi-component disease management or chronic care programs for adults with 
COPD, describing process, intermediate, and end results of care. Data were 
independently extracted by two reviewers and descriptively summarized.
RESULTS: Twenty articles describing 17 unique COPD programs were included. There 
is little evidence for significant improvements in process and intermediate 
outcomes, except for increased provision of patient self-management education 
and improved disease-specific knowledge. Overall, the COPD programs generate end 
results equivalent to usual care, but programs containing >or=3 components show 
lower relative risks for hospitalization. There is limited scope for programs to 
break-even or save money.
CONCLUSION: Identifying cost effective multi-component COPD programs remains a 
challenge due to scarce methodologically sound studies that demonstrate 
significant improvements on process, intermediate and end results of care. 
Estimations of potential cost effectiveness of specific programs illustrated in 
this paper can, in the absence of 'perfect data', support timely decision-making 
regarding these programs. Nevertheless, well-designed health economic studies 
are needed to decrease the current decision uncertainty.

Life expectancy and years of life lost in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 
findings from the NHANES III Follow-up Study.

RATIONALE: Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) causes increased mortality in the general population. But life 
expectancy and the years of life lost have not been reported.
OBJECTIVES: To quantify mortality, examine how it varies with age, sex, and 
other risk factors, and determine how life expectancy is affected.
METHODS: We constructed mortality models using the Third National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey, adjusting for age, sex, race, and major medical 
conditions. We used these to compute life expectancy and the years of life lost.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary function testing classified patients as 
having Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 0, 1, 2, 3 or 
4 COPD or restriction. COPD is associated with only a modest reduction in life 
expectancy for never smokers, but with a very large reduction for current and 
former smokers. At age 65, the reductions in male life expectancy for stage 1, 
stage 2, and stages 3 or 4 disease in current smokers are 0.3 years, 2.2 years, 
and 5.8 years. These are in addition to the 3.5 years lost due to smoking. In 
former smokers the reductions are 1.4 years and 5.6 years for stage 2 and stages 
3 or 4 disease, and in never smokers they are 0.7 and 1.3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with COPD have an increased risk of mortality compared to 
those who do not, with consequent reduction in life expectancy. The effect is 
most marked in current smokers, and this is further reason for smokers to quit.

Income, health, and well-being around the world: evidence from the Gallup World 
Poll.

University, Princeton, New Jersey and National Bureau of Economic Research,

During 2006, the Gallup Organization conducted a World Poll that used an 
identical questionnaire for national samples of adults from 132 countries. I 
analyze the data on life satisfaction and on health satisfaction and look at 
their relationships with national income, age, and life-expectancy. Average life 
satisfaction is strongly related to per capita national income; each doubling of 
income is associated with a near one point increase in life satisfaction on a 
scale from 0 to 10. Unlike most previous findings, the effect holds across the 
range of international incomes; if anything, it is slightly stronger among rich 
countries. Conditional on national income, recent economic growth makes people 
less satisfied with their lives, improvements in life-expectancy make them more 
satisfied, but life-expectancy itself has little effect. In most countries, 
except the richest, older people are less satisfied with their lives. National 
income moderates the effects of aging on self-reported health, and the decline 
in health satisfaction with age is much stronger in poor countries than in rich 
countries. In line with earlier findings, people in much of Eastern Europe and 
in the countries of the former Soviet Union are particularly dissatisfied with 
their lives and with their health, and older people in those countries are much 
less satisfied with their lives and with their health than are younger people. 
HIV prevalence in Africa has little effect on Africans’ life or health 
satisfaction; the fraction of Kenyans who are satisfied with their personal 
health is the same as the fraction of Britons and higher than the fraction of 
Americans. The US ranks 88th out of 120 countries in the fraction of people who 
have confidence in their healthcare system, and has a lower score than countries 
such as India, Iran, Malawi, Afghanistan or Angola . While the strong 
relationship between life-satisfaction and income gives some credence to the 
measures, as do the low levels of life and health satisfaction in Eastern Europe 
and the countries of the former Soviet Union, the lack of correlations between 
life and health satisfaction and health measures shows that self-assessed life 
or health evaluations cannot be regarded as useful summary indicators of human 
welfare in international comparisons.
