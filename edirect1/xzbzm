BACKGROUND: There is a debate in the health economics literature concerning the 
most appropriate way of applying Amartya Sen's capability approach in economic 
evaluation studies. Some suggest that quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) alone 
are adequate while others argue that this approach is too narrow and that direct 
measures of capability wellbeing provide a more extensive application of Sen's 
paradigm.
OBJECTIVE: This paper empirically explores whether QALYs provide a good proxy 
for individual capabilities.
METHODS: Data is taken from a multinational cross-sectional survey of 
individuals with seven health conditions (asthma, arthritis, cancer, depression, 
diabetes, hearing loss, heart disease) and a healthy population. Each individual 
completed the ICECAP-A measure of capability wellbeing for adults and six health 
utility instruments that are used to generate QALYs, including EQ-5D and SF-6D. 
Primary analysis examines how well health utility instruments can explain 
variation in the ICECAP-A using ordinary least squares regression.
RESULTS: The findings show that all seven health conditions have a negative 
association on overall capability as measured by the ICECAP-A index. Inclusion 
of health utility instruments into separate regressions improves the predictive 
power of capability but on average, explains less than half of the variation in 
capability wellbeing. Individuals with arthritis appear to be less inhibited in 
terms of capability losses when accounting for health utility, yet those who 
have depression record significant reductions in capability relative to the 
healthy population even after accounting for the most commonly used health 
utility instruments.
CONCLUSION: The study therefore casts doubt on the ability of QALYs to act as a 
reliable proxy measure of individuals' capability.

BACKGROUND: People with disabilities tend to be at risk for secondary 
conditions. There is a need for comprehensive disability and health databases, 
including geographic information systems to evaluate trends in health, 
functioning, and employment.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated county levels in morbidity and mortality across the 
Southeastern United States using spatial regression, examining 2015 trends in 
accordance with Healthy People 2020 objectives.
METHODS: We merged 2015 National County Health Rankings and the 2015 Social 
Security Administration's Report on SSDI Beneficiaries, all for n = 1387 
Southeastern U.S. county units. We used GeoDa to regress health and disability 
multivariable models for the dependent variable, age-adjusted Years of Potential 
Life Lost (YPLL) per 100,000 population.
RESULTS: The principal Health/Demographic multivariable model of factors 
impacting YPLL yielded an adjusted R2 = 0.743 (F = 188.3, p < 0.001) with 
percentage physically inactive, preventable hospital stays, percentage 
diabetics, and low college attendance figuring prominently. A 
Socioeconomic/Demographic multivariable model impacting YPLL yielded R2 = 0.631 
(F = 156.0, p < 0.001), with disability and percentage unemployment being major 
associated variables.
CONCLUSIONS: For the Southeastern U.S., counties with higher prevalence of SSDI 
disability workers correlated with significantly higher YPLL and poorer health 
outcomes. The research augments CDC Disability and Health GIS systems to measure 
Healthy People 2020 outcomes for persons with disabilities nationwide. Spatial 
regression represents a robust approach for improved analysis of geographic data 
for population health measures.

Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder caused by a point 
mutation that renders hemoglobin susceptible to polymerization when 
deoxygenated, affects millions of people worldwide. Manifestations of SCD 
include chronic hemolytic anemia, inflammation, painful vaso-occlusive crises, 
multisystem organ damage, and reduced life expectancy. Part of SCD 
pathophysiology is the excessive formation of intracellular reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) in SCD red blood cells (RBCs), which accelerates their hemolysis. 
Normal RBC precursors eliminate their mitochondria during the terminal 
differentiation process. Strikingly, we observed an increased percentage of RBCs 
retaining mitochondria in SCD patient blood samples compared with healthy 
individuals. In addition, using an experimental SCD mouse model, we demonstrate 
that excessive levels of ROS in SCD are associated with this abnormal 
mitochondrial retention. Interestingly, the LSD1 inhibitor, RN-1, and the 
mitophagy-inducing agent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, 
sirolimus, increased RBC lifespan and reduced ROS accumulation in parallel with 
reducing mitochondria-retaining RBCs in the SCD mouse model. Furthermore, gene 
expression analysis of SCD mice treated with RN-1 showed increased expression of 
mitophagy genes. Our findings suggest that reduction of mitochondria-retaining 
RBCs may provide a new therapeutic approach to preventing excessive ROS in SCD.

Life begins at 60: Identifying the social support needs of African American 
women aging with HIV.

Warren-Jeanpiere L, Dillaway H, Hamilton P, Young M, Goparaju L.

HIV chronicity has resulted in increased life expectancy for many African 
American women who acquired the disease during the epidemic's peak years. As 
these women live longer and age, their social support needs may increase. Five 
focus groups were conducted in Washington, DC with 23 HIV-positive African 
American women aged 52-65 to explore women's perceptions about how aging and HIV 
chronicity affects their social support needs. Participants were recruited from 
the longitudinal Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) participant pool. A 
constant comparison approach was applied during data analysis. Participants 
reported needing increased social support, especially emotional support from 
health care providers, family, and HIV-positive peers. The importance of 
providers and HIV-positive peers was discussed most frequently relative to 
meeting these needs. Health care providers in particular may need to increase 
their provision of emotional support when devising treatment plans to meet the 
social support needs of older HIV-positive African American women.

The effects of three concentrations (0.2%, 1% and 3%) of rosemary oil (RO) on 
the freshness indicators, oxidative stability, fatty acid and biogenic amine 
(BA) contents of minced rainbow trout muscle (MTM) were investigated after 
different periods of storage (three and nine days) at 4 ± 1 °C. Moreover, the 
terpene and sesquiterpene contents in the treated MTM were also measured. RO 
treatment improves the pH, oxidative stability of the lipids and the FA profile, 
which resulted in a significant extension of MTM shelf-life. Storage time 
influenced all freshness indicators, with the exception of yellowness and 
chroma. Treatment with RO had a positive effect, leading to low BA content, 
especially putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine and histamine. Differences in BA 
were also found to be due to storage time, with the exception of spermidine, 
which was not influenced by time. Moreover, the presence of the terpenoid 
fraction of RO in MTM improved the quality of this ready-to-cook fish food.

O₂ sensors were used to non-destructively monitor O₂ levels in commercially 
packed pre-cooked, convenience modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) foods. A 
substantial level of O₂ (>15%) was present in packs resulting in a shorter than 
expected shelf-life, where the primary spoilage mechanism was found to be mould. 
Various combinations of vacuum (0-0.6 MPa) and gas flush (0.02-0.03 MPa) (30% 
CO₂/70% N₂) settings were assessed as treatments that result in the desired 
shelf-life (28 days). This was achieved using the combined treatment of vacuum 
0.35 MPa and gas flush 0.02 MPa which resulted in a reduction of 6%-9% O2 in all 
three samples (battered sausages (BS), bacon slices (BA), and meat and potato 
pies (PP)). Reduced O₂ levels reflect the microbial quality of products, which 
has been successfully reduced. Duplicate samples of all product packs were 
produced using ethanol emitters (EE) to see if shelf-life could be further 
extended. Results showed a further improvement in shelf-life to 35 days. Sensory 
analysis showed that ethanol flavour and aroma was not perceived by panellists 
in two of the three products assessed. This study demonstrates how smart 
packaging technologies, both intelligent and active, can be used to assist in 
the modification of conventional packaging systems in order to enhance product 
quality and safety and through the extension of product shelf-life.

Background. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer with a historically dire prognosis. We 
sought to calculate life expectancies for patients with pleural or peritoneal 
mesothelioma, both at time of diagnosis and several years later, and to examine 
whether survival has improved in recent years. Methods. Data on 10,258 pleural 
and 1,229 peritoneal patients from the SEER US national cancer database, 
1973-2011, were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. 
Results. The major factors related to survival were age, sex, stage, grade, 
histology, and treatment. Survival improved only modestly over the study period: 
0.5% per year for pleural and 2% for peritoneal. Conclusions. Life expectancies 
were markedly reduced from normal, even amongst 5-year survivors with the most 
favorable characteristics and treatment options.

OBJECTIVES: We analysed differences in healthy life expectancy at age 50 (HLE50) 
between migrants and non-migrants in Belgium , the Netherlands, and England and 
Wales, and their trends over time between 2001 and 2011 in the latter two 
countries.
METHODS: Population, mortality and health data were derived from registers, 
census or surveys. HLE50 and the share of remaining healthy life years were 
calculated for non-migrants, western and non-western migrants by sex. We applied 
decomposition techniques to answer whether differences in HLE50 between origin 
groups and changes in HLE50 over time were attributable to either differences in 
mortality or health.
RESULTS: In all three countries, older (non-western) migrants could expect to 
live less years in good health than older non-migrants. Differences in HLE50 
between migrants and non-migrants diminished over time in the Netherlands, but 
they increased in England and Wales. General health, rather than mortality, 
mainly explained (trends in) inequalities in healthy life expectancy between 
migrants and non-migrants.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions aimed at reducing the health and mortality 
inequalities between older migrants and non-migrants should focus on prevention, 
and target especially non-western migrants.

PURPOSE: Sesamin, a polyphenolic compound found in sesame seeds, has been 
reported to exert a variety of beneficial health effects. We have previously 
reported that sesamin increases the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. In this 
study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the longevity effect 
of sesamin in C. elegans.
METHODS: Starting from three days of age, Caenorhabditis elegans animals were 
fed a standard diet alone or supplemented with sesamin. A C. elegans genome 
array was used to perform a comprehensive expression analysis. Genes that showed 
differential expression were validated using real-time PCR. Mutant or 
RNAi-treated animals were fed sesamin, and the lifespan was determined to 
identify the genes involved in the longevity effects of sesamin.
RESULTS: The microarray analysis revealed that endoplasmic reticulum unfolded 
protein response-related genes, which have been reported to show decreased 
expression under conditions of SIR-2.1/Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) overexpression, were 
downregulated in animals supplemented with sesamin. Sesamin failed to extend the 
lifespan of sir-2.1 knockdown animals and of sir-2.1 loss-of-function mutants. 
Sesamin was also ineffective in bec-1 RNAi-treated animals; bec-1 is a key 
regulator of autophagy, and is necessary for longevity induced by sir-2.1 
overexpression. Furthermore, the heterozygotic mutation of daf-15, which encodes 
the target of rapamycin (TOR)-binding partner Raptor, abolished lifespan 
extension by sesamin. Moreover, sesamin did not prolong the lifespan of 
loss-of-function mutants of aak-2, which encodes the AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK).
CONCLUSIONS: Sesamin extends the lifespan of C. elegans through several dietary 
restriction-related signaling pathways, including processes requiring SIRT1, 
TOR, and AMPK.

We report the case of a patient with acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis 
and he suffered an atraumatic splenic rupture. Splenic rupture not associated 
with trauma is a rare entity that can occurs in normal spleen (spontaneous) or 
damaged spleen (pathological). This entity may be associated with local 
inflammatory processes, such as pancreatitis. Ultrasound is a non-invasive 
technique which is used in unstable patients. CT is useful for making a 
diagnosis of extension in patients with hemodynamic stability. Atraumatic 
splenic rupture as a complication of chronic pancreatitis is an unusual disease 
that requires a high index of suspicion which allows us an early diagnosis 
because it is a treatable entity that compromises the patient's life.

Diseases caused by southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) and rice 
ragged stunt virus (RRSV) considerably decrease grain yield. Therefore, 
determining rice cultivars with high resistance to SRBSDV and RRSV is necessary. 
In this study, rice cultivars with high resistance to SRBSDV and RRSV were 
evaluated through field trials in Shidian and Mangshi county, Yunnan province, 
China. SYBR Green I-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) analysis was used to quantitatively detect virus gene expression 
levels in different rice varieties. The following parameters were applied to 
evaluate rice resistance: acre yield (A.Y.), incidence of infected plants 
(I.I.P.), virus load (V.L.), disease index (D.I.), and insect quantity (I.Q.) 
per 100 clusters. Zhongzheyou1 (Z1) and Liangyou2186 (L2186) were considered the 
most suitable varieties with integrated higher A.Y., lower I.I.P., V.L., D.I. 
and I.Q.
FEATURES: In order to investigate the mechanism of rice resistance, comparative 
label-free shotgun liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
proteomic approaches were applied to comprehensively describe the proteomics of 
rice varieties' SRBSDV tolerance. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-related 
proteins in Z1 and L2186 may result in the superior resistance of these 
varieties compared with Fengyouxiangzhan (FYXZ).

BACKGROUND: We set out to estimate net survival trends for 10 common cancers in 
279 cancer registry populations in 67 countries around the world, as part of the 
CONCORD-2 study. Net survival can be interpreted as the proportion of cancer 
patients who survive up to a given time, after eliminating the impact of 
mortality from other causes (background mortality). Background mortality varies 
widely between populations and over time. It was therefore necessary to 
construct robust life tables that accurately reflected the background mortality 
in each of the registry populations.
METHODS: Life tables of all-cause mortality rates by single year of age and sex 
were constructed by calendar year for each population and, when possible, by 
racial or ethnic sub-groups. We used three different approaches, based on the 
type of mortality data available from each registry. With death and population 
counts, we adopted a flexible multivariable modelling approach. With unsmoothed 
mortality rates, we used the Ewbank relational method. Where no data were 
available from the registry or a national statistical office, we used the 
abridged UN Population Division life tables and interpolated these using the 
Elandt-Johnson method. We also investigated the impact of using state- and 
race-specific life tables versus national race-specific life tables on estimates 
of net survival from four adult cancers in the United States (US).
RESULTS: We constructed 6,514 life tables covering 327 populations. Wide 
variations in life expectancy at birth and mortality by age were observed, even 
within countries. During 1995-99, life expectancy was lowest in Nigeria and 
highest in Japan, ranging from 47 to 84 years among females and 46 to 78 years 
among males. During 2005-09, life expectancy was lowest in Lesotho and again 
highest in Japan, ranging from 45 to 86 years among females and 45 to 80 years 
among males. For the US, estimates of net survival differed by up to 4% if 
background mortality was fully controlled with state- and race-specific life 
tables, rather than with national race-specific life tables.
CONCLUSIONS: Background mortality varies worldwide. This emphasises the 
importance of using population-specific life tables for geographic and 
international comparisons of net survival.

The interest in the induction of secondary tumours following radiotherapy has 
greatly increased as developments in detecting and treating the primary tumours 
have improved the life expectancy of cancer patients. However, most of the 
knowledge on the current levels of risk comes from patients treated many decades 
ago. As developments of irradiation techniques take place at a much faster pace 
than the progression of the carcinogenesis process, the earlier results could 
not be easily extrapolated to modern treatments. Indeed, the patterns of 
irradiation from historically-used orthovoltage radiotherapy and from 
contemporary techniques like conformal radiotherapy with megavoltage radiation, 
intensity modulated radiation therapy with photons or with particles are quite 
different. Furthermore, the increased interest in individualised treatment 
options raises the question of evaluating and ranking the different treatment 
plan options from the point of view of the risk for cancer induction, in 
parallel with the quantification of other long-term effects. It is therefore 
inevitable that models for risk assessment will have to be used to complement 
the knowledge from epidemiological studies and to make predictions for newer 
forms of treatment for which clinical evidence is not yet available. This work 
reviews the mathematical models that could be used to predict the risk of 
secondary cancers from radiotherapy-relevant dose levels, as well as the 
approaches and factors that have to be taken into account when including these 
models in the clinical evaluation process. These include the effects of 
heterogeneous irradiation, secondary particles production, imaging techniques, 
interpatient variability and other confounding factors.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) often causes disabling pain that impairs 
a patient's quality of life. Surgical treatment is recommended for patients who 
do not respond to conservative treatments lasting more than 6 months. The 
purpose of this study is to present results after the use of an interlaminar 
dynamic spacer for CLBP.
METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients with CLBP irresponsive to more than 6 
months of conservative treatment into the present study. Included patients 
underwent an interlaminar dynamic spacer insertion without direct decompression. 
We assessed radiographic parameters and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
data included visual analog scale back/leg pain and Oswestry Disability Index 
scores. Substantial clinical benefit achievement was assessed.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (average age, 47.8 years; 21 female) were 
included. The mean preoperative symptom duration was 29.6 months. Surgeries 
involved 1-level (n = 18) and 2-levels (n = 17) procedures. Operative levels 
included L4-5 (n = 8), L5-S1 (n = 10), L3-4-5 (n-2), and L4-5-S1 (n = 15). The 
average follow-up period was 16.6 months. After the procedure, all radiographic 
parameters (including disc height, segmental extension angle, and foraminal 
area) improved significantly. All preoperative HRQoL parameters improved 
significantly at the final follow-up. Substantial clinical benefit achievement 
was observed in 75.8% of the cases on the Oswestry Disability Index, and in 
72.7% and 84.8% of the cases on the visual analog scale back and leg pain, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: An interlaminar dynamic spacer significantly improves HRQoL scores 
in patients with CLBP who do not respond to conservative treatment. Although 
encouraging, these results should be confirmed with studies assessing a larger 
cohort and a longer follow-up.

Fetal health stagnation: Have health conditions in utero improved in the United 
States and Western and Northern Europe over the past 150 years?

Kingdom. Electronic address: e.b.schneider@lse.ac.uk.

Many empirical studies have shown that health conditions in utero can have long 
lasting consequences for health across the life course. However, despite this 
evidence, there is no clear consensus about how fetal health has changed in the 
very long run. This paper analyses historical birth weights and perinatal 
mortality rates to construct a coherent picture of how health conditions in 
utero have changed over the past 150 years. In short, the evidence suggests that 
fetal health has been relatively stagnant. Limited evidence on birth weights 
shows that they had already reached their current levels in North America and 
Northern and Western Europe by the late nineteenth century, and they have 
changed very little in between. Perinatal mortality rates have fallen 
dramatically since the late 1930s, but this decline was mainly caused by 
improvements in intrapartum treatments after the introduction of Sulfa drugs and 
antibiotics. Thus, the health benefits associated with the perinatal mortality 
decline were concentrated among those at risk and did not influence the 
population at large. Finding stagnant fetal health during a period when many 
other indicators of health improved dramatically is provocative and suggests two 
conclusions: either fetal health did not improve or the indicators used to 
measure fetal health, indicators still widely used today, may not accurately 
capture all aspects of health in utero. If fetal health has been stagnant, then 
better conditions in utero cannot explain cohort improvements in life expectancy 
over the twentieth century. If the indicators of fetal health are problematic, 
then researchers must move beyond birth weight and perinatal mortality to 
understand how developmental plasticity based on the prenatal environment 
influences later life health.

Collective cell movement is one of the strategies for achieving the complex 
shapes of tissues and organs. In this process, multiple cells within a group 
held together by cell-cell adhesion acquire mobility and move together in the 
same direction. In some well-studied models of collective cell movement, the 
mobility depends strongly on traction generated at the leading edge by cells 
located at the front. However, recent advances in live-imaging techniques have 
led to the discovery of other types of collective cell movement lacking a 
leading edge or even a free edge at the front, in a diverse array of 
morphological events, including tubule elongation, epithelial sheet extension, 
and tissue rotation. We herein review some of the developmental events that are 
organized by collective cell movement and attempt to elucidate the underlying 
cellular and molecular mechanisms, which include membrane protrusions, guidance 
cues, cell intercalation, and planer cell polarity, or chirality pathways.

Adapted Version of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 
(EWGSOP) Criteria.

Food Technology (INTA) - University of Chile, El Líbano 5524, Casilla 138-11, 
Santiago, Chile, E-mail: calbala@uchile.cl.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of mass and skeletal muscle 
strength and has serious consequences on older people's health. The Chilean 
older population has a high life-expectancy, but the prevalence of functional 
dependence is also high.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in Chilean older adults and 
its relationship with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: 1,006 non-disabled, community-dwelling subjects aged 60 years or 
older living in Santiago.
MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometric measurements, handgrip strength, physical 
performance tests, and dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry (DXA) scan were 
performed. Sarcopenia was defined using the algorithm of the European Working 
Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). Muscle mass was measured with DXA 
scan; skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and hand dynamometry were defined with 
cut-off points obtained for the Chilean population. For a 3m walking speed we 
used the cut-off point of the EWGSOP definition. Nutritional status and obesity 
were defined according to World Health Organization standards. Association 
between sarcopenia and age, gender, BMI and lean/fat mass ratio was estimated by 
logistic regression models.
RESULTS: The prevalence of sarcopenia was 19.1% (95%CI: 16.8%-21.8%), similar in 
men and women. There was an increasing trend of sarcopenia by age group and a 
decreasing trend with nutritional status. After logistic regression, sarcopenia 
was positively associated with age (OR=1.10; 95%CI:1.06-1.15) and falls 
(OR=1.83; 95%CI:1.07-3.15) and negatively associated with overweight (OR=0.31; 
95%CI:0.16-0.59), obesity (OR=0.02; 95%CI:0.004-0.11), lean mass/fat mass ratio 
(OR=0.69; 95%CI:0.48-0.9997), knee height (OR=0.78; 95%CI:0.68-0.89) and calf 
circumference (OR=0.87; 95%CI:0.77-0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: The total prevalence of sarcopenia was 19.1% increasing with age 
reaching 39.6% in people of 80 or more years of age. A negative association of 
sarcopenia with overweight, obesity and lean/fat mass ratio was observed. 
Although the high prevalence of obesity (35.9%), only 2% of obese people were 
sarcopenic.

Radiological Examinations in Pediatric Age.

Siciliano R(1).

Author information:

Catanzaro, Italy.

Diagnostic radiology imaging is an essential tool for adequate clinical 
investigation of pathological processes and the drafting of a personalized 
therapy plan. However, in recent years, there has been a substantial increase of 
requests, mainly due to technological advances but also to social and cultural 
reasons, not always based on the principle of the diagnostic justification. The 
progress of recent years in the field of diagnostic radiology has made available 
to the physician a variety of sophisticated radiological examinations, which are 
not always used rationally and appropriately. The theme is of paramount 
importance, particularly in childhood or adolescence, characterized by elevated 
radiosensitivity (high cell turnover) and longer life expectancy; therefore, 
children exposed to ionizing radiation are theoretically subject to a higher 
risk of carcinogenesis compared to the general population. For these reasons the 
young patients should have greater protection and examinations must respect 
stringent appropriateness criteria. Far from underestimating the important 
diagnostic and therapeutic benefits that these procedures provide, the use of 
ionizing radiations must minimize the radiation-related risk in accordance with 
the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable), key principle of modern 
radiation protection.

The cranberry fruitworm (Acrobasis vaccinii Riley), sparganothis fruitworm 
(Sparganothis sulfureana Clemens), and blackheaded fireworm (Rhopobota naevana 
Hübner) are historically significant pests of cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon 
Aiton) in the Upper Midwest (Wisconsin), USA. Their respective natural histories 
are well documented but correlations between developmental benchmarks (e.g., 
larval eclosion) and degree-day accruals are not yet known. Treatment timings 
are critical to the optimization of any given control tactic, and degree-day 
accrual facilitates optimization by quantifying the developmental status of pest 
populations. When key developmental benchmarks in the pest life cycle are linked 
to degree-days, real-time weather data can be used to predict precise treatment 
timings. Here, we provide the degree-day accumulations associated with discrete 
biological events (i.e., initiation of flight and peak flight) for the three 
most consistent moth pests of cranberries in Wisconsin. Moths were trapped each 
spring and summer from 2003 to 2011. To characterize flight dynamics and average 
timing of flight initiation, pheromone-baited trap-catch data were tallied for 
all three pest species within each of seven growing seasons. These flight 
dynamics were then associated with the corresponding degree-day accumulations 
generated using the cranberry plant's developmental thresholds. Finally, models 
were fit to the data in order to determine the peak flight of each species. The 
initiation of the spring flight among all three moth species was highly 
synchronous, aiding in the timing of control tactics; however, there were 
substantial differences in the timing of peak flight among the moth species. 
Characterization of the relationship between temperature and pest development 
allows pest management professionals to target specific life stages, improving 
the efficacy of any given pest control tactic.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate change in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease and 
the economic burden associated with comprehensive treatment of the chronic 
HCV-infected Medicaid population.
STUDY DESIGN: Decision-analytic Markov model.
METHODS: Treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV were followed over 
a lifetime horizon from the third-party payer perspective. Patients entered the 
model insured under Medicaid and were treated under state-specific restrictions 
by Metavir fibrosis stage (base case) or all treated (all-patient strategy) with 
an approved all-oral regimen (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir [LDV/SOF] for 8 weeks or 12 
weeks, depending on cirrhosis status, viral load, and state-specific LDV/SOF 
restrictions). Untreated patients were assumed to age into Medicare at 65 years, 
where they were treated with LDV/SOF without restriction by fibrotic stage.
RESULTS: The sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of the current Medicaid 
LDV/SOF restriction strategy was 75.2% versus 95.9% if all LDV/SOF-eligible 
patients were treated under Medicaid. Treating all eligible Medicaid patients 
with LDV/SOF, regardless of fibrotic stage, was projected to result in 36,752 
fewer cases of cirrhosis; 1739 fewer liver transplants; 8169 fewer cases of 
hepatocellular carcinoma; 16,173 fewer HCV-related deaths; 0.84 additional 
life-years per patient; and 1.03 additional quality-adjusted life-years per 
patient. Treating all Medicaid patients with chronic HCV using LDV/SOF resulted 
in a 39.4% ($3.8 billion) savings and decreased the proportion of total costs 
attributable to downstream costs of care to 18.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: A "treat all" strategy in a Medicaid population resulted in 
superior SVRs, substantial reductions in downstream negative clinical outcomes, 
and considerable cost savings. Current restrictive state policies regarding HCV 
treatment in Medicaid populations must be reassessed in light of these data.

[Does the sidedness determine the first line treatment of irresectable 
metastatic colorectal cancer?].

INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Median life expectancy of non-resectable metastatic 
colorectal cancer may surpass three years. However, several points of the 
treatment strategy are subject of ongoing debate. Optimal sequence of targeted 
agents is not elucidated either. Based on retrospective analyses of six clinical 
studies and a metaanalysis, the superiority of anti-EGFR agents such as 
cetuximab and panitumumab over anti-VEGF bevacizumab has been proposed in the 
treatment of left sided tumours.
METHOD: The results of the six major clinical trials were analysed. 
Insufficiencies of the meta-analysis are pointed: the lack of homogeneity among 
control groups, the omission of later lines of therapy, the inconsistency 
between progression free and overall survival benefit and the high proportion of 
excluded patients.
RESULTS: The trials confirm the worse prognosis of right sided versus left sided 
colorectal cancers.
CONCLUSION: To date the data are not strong enough to support the preference of 
any of the available targeted agents at the first line setting in the treatment 
of left sided metastatic RAS and BRAF wild type colorectal cancers. Several 
trials suggest that anti-EGFR treatment has no additional benefit as compared to 
chemotherapy alone in the treatment of right-sided tumours. Orv. Hetil., 2017,
