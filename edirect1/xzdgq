Objective: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of ginkgolide plus 
aspirin compared with placebo plus aspirin treatment of ischemic stroke. 
Background: Stroke is the leading cause of death and long-term disability in 
China, with high incidence, high mortality, and heavy disease burden. In 
addition to Western medicines, Chinese clinical guidelines for diagnosis and 
treatment of acute ischemic stroke recommend application of Chinese patent 
medicines. Ginkgolide injection is commonly used in the clinical treatment of 
stroke in China to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis. The 
economy of ginkgolide injection needs to be evaluated. Methods: A Markov model 
was constructed consisting of four disease states: no significant disability, 
disability, stroke recurrence, and death. Therapeutic data were taken from the 
Ginkgolide in Ischemic Stroke Patients with Large Artery Atherosclerosis (GISAA) 
study. Utilities and transition probabilities were extracted from the 
literature. Cost data were obtained from the China Health Statistics Yearbook 
and hospital record survey. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) of 13 years of cycles (calculated by average age of subjects and Chinese 
life expectancy) were calculated through TreeAge Pro11 software. The 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set as the Chinese per capita Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019, CN¥70,892/QALY. The results were analyzed by 
single factor and probability sensitivity analyses. Results: Ginkgolide plus 
aspirin had a higher expected per-patient cost than placebo plus aspirin but a 
higher QALYs. Compared with placebo plus aspirin, ginkgolide plus aspirin 
produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CN¥14,866.06/QALY, which is 
below the WTP threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested the 
acceptability of ginkgolide plus aspirin was higher than that of placebo plus 
aspirin. Conclusions: The present cost-effectiveness analysis showed that 
addition of ginkgolides to conventional treatment is cost-effective at a 
threshold the Chinese per capita GDP.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
fruquintinib compared to regorafenib as third-line treatment for patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in China.
METHODS: A three-state Markov model with monthly cycle was constructed to 
estimate lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of fruquintinib 
versus regorafenib as third-line treatment for patients with mCRC from Chinese 
health care perspective. Survival analysis was applied to calculate transition 
probabilities using the data from the clinical trials FRESCO and CONCUR, which 
were also the data sources accessing probabilities of adverse events. Background 
mortality rate and drug costs were derived from government published data. Costs 
for medical services were obtained from real-world data and published 
literatures. Utilities applied to calculate the quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were obtained from literature review. One-way sensitivity analysis and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis were adopted to verify the robustness of the 
results.
RESULTS: Fruquintinib provided 0.74 QALYs at a cost of CNY 151,058 (USD 22,888), 
whereas regorafenib provided 0.79 QALYs at a cost of CNY 226,657 (USD 32,224). 
Compared to fruquintinib, the ICER of regorafenib was CNY 1,529,197/QALY (USD 
231,697/QALY) from Chinese health care perspective, which was above the triple 
GDP per capita of China in 2019 (CNY 212,676) (USD 32,224) as the threshold to 
define the cost-effectiveness. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the results 
were generally robust. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated the probability that 
fruquintinib was more cost-effective was 100% when the threshold was the triple 
GDP per capita of China.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to regorafenib, fruquintinib, which leads to forego about 
0.05 QALYs and save about CNY 75,599 (USD 11,454), is a cost-effective choice as 
the third-line treatment for patients with mCRC in China.

This article reviews some key strands of demographic research on past trends in 
human longevity and explores possible future trends in life expectancy at birth. 
Demographic data on age-specific mortality are used to estimate life expectancy, 
and validated data on exceptional life spans are used to study the maximum 
length of life. In the countries doing best each year, life expectancy started 
to increase around 1840 at a pace of almost 2.5 y per decade. This trend has 
continued until the present. Contrary to classical evolutionary theories of 
senescence and contrary to the predictions of many experts, the frontier of 
survival is advancing to higher ages. Furthermore, individual life spans are 
becoming more equal, reducing inequalities, with octogenarians and nonagenarians 
accounting for most deaths in countries with the highest life expectancy. If the 
current pace of progress in life expectancy continues, most children born this 
millennium will celebrate their 100th birthday. Considerable uncertainty, 
however, clouds forecasts: Life expectancy and maximum life span might increase 
very little if at all, or longevity might rise much faster than in the past. 
Substantial progress has been made over the past three decades in deepening 
understanding of how long humans have lived and how long they might live. The 
social, economic, health, cultural, and political consequences of further 
increases in longevity are so significant that the development of more powerful 
methods of forecasting is a priority.

Half-life extension strategies to reduce the intravitreal dosing frequency of 
biomolecules for the treatment of retinal neovascular diseases are attracting 
increasing interest. This study investigated ocular and systemic 
pharmacokinetics of the trivalent nanobody BI-X (with affinity to VEGF, Ang-2 
and human albumin) in cynomolgus monkeys after intravitreal injection. BI-X 
concentrations were measured in serial samples of plasma, vitreous humor, 
aqueous humor and retina. Ocular pharmacokinetics of BI-X exhibited two phases. 
Initially up to 2-4 weeks after dosing, BI-X concentrations in vitreal, aqueous 
humor and retina declined with half-lives of around 3 days, which is comparable 
to macromolecules with a similar molecular weight. Thereafter, only vitreal 
concentrations were measurable, with a terminal half-life of 13.2 days, which is 
considerably longer than expected based on the BI-X molecular weight or 
hydrodynamic radius. It is hypothesized that binding of BI-X to low levels of 
intraocular albumin resulted in this half-life extension. BI-X was detectable in 
plasma up to 10 weeks post-dosing. Plasma pharmacokinetics of BI-X exhibited a 
similar biphasic disposition profile to the vitreous body, with a terminal 
half-life of 11.8 days, thus reflecting input kinetics from the eye. In 
conclusion, an important half-life extension principle based on vitreal albumin 
binding could be confirmed in a primate model, and the data obtained can 
potentially be translated to humans taking into account the differing vitreal 
albumin concentrations.

Circular RNAs are produced from back-splicing of exons of precursor mRNAs 
(pre-mRNAs). The sequences of exons in circular RNAs are identical to their 
linear cognate mRNAs, but the circular format may confer constraints on their 
folding and conformation, leading to potentially different functions from their 
linear RNA cognates. Here, we describe experimental and computational steps that 
optimize the selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and 
mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP) to probe circular RNA secondary structure at 
single-nucleotide resolution in living cells.

From pain patient to junkie: An economic theory of painkiller consumption and 
its impact on wellbeing and longevity.

In this paper, I propose a life cycle model of painkiller consumption that 
combines the theory of health deficit accumulation with the theory of addiction. 
Chronic pain is conceptualized as a persistent negative shock to lifetime 
utility that can be treated by pain relief medication. Individuals treated with 
opioid pain relievers (OPR) develop addiction, which increases their demand for 
opioids and reduces their welfare and life expectancy through side effects and 
potential overdose. I calibrate the model for a benchmark American and 
investigate the comparative dynamics of alternative drug characteristics, pain 
intensities, and ages of onsets of pain as well as their implications for 
welfare and life expectancy. Computational experiments are used to identify 
fully rational and imperfectly rational addiction behavior. Fully rational 
addicts reduce OPR use when new information about the addictive potential of 
these drugs arrives. Imperfectly rational addicts further develop their 
addiction and switch to illicit opioid use. Likewise, a discontinued 
prescription helps fully rational addicts to quit quickly, while it induces 
imperfectly rational individuals to take up heroin. I also discuss treatment of 
OPR addiction and the use of opioids in palliative care.

The implications of changing education distributions for life expectancy 
gradients.

Recent research has proposed that shifting education distributions across 
cohorts are influencing estimates of educational gradients in mortality. We use 
data from the United States and Finland covering four decades to explore this 
assertion. We base our analysis around our new finding: a negative logarithmic 
relationship between relative education and relative mortality. This 
relationship holds across multiple age groups, both sexes, two very different 
countries, and time periods spanning four decades. The inequality parameters 
from this model indicate increasing relative mortality differentials over time. 
We use these findings to develop a method that allows us to compute life 
expectancy for any given segment of the education distribution (e.g., education 
quintiles). We apply this method to Finnish and American data to compute life 
expectancy gradients that are adjusted for changes in the education 
distribution. In Finland, these distribution-adjusted education differentials in 
life expectancy between the top and bottom education quintiles have increased by 
two years for men, and remained stable for women between 1971 and 2010. Similar 
distribution-adjusted estimates for the U.S. suggest that educational 
disparities in life expectancy increased by 3.3 years for non-Hispanic white men 
and 3.0 years for non-Hispanic white women between the 1980s and 2000s. For men 
and women, respectively, these differentials between the top and bottom 
education quintiles are smaller than the differentials between the top and 
bottom education categories by 18% and 39% in the U.S. and by 39% and 100% in 
Finland. Had the relative inequality parameters of mortality governing the 
Finnish and U.S. populations remained constant at their earliest period values, 
the difference in life expectancy between the top and bottom education quintiles 
would - because of overall mortality reductions - have declined moderately. The 
findings suggest that educational expansion may bias estimates of trends in 
educational differences in life expectancy upwards.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) have reduced life 
expectancy compared with the general population. Diabetes is a contributor to 
this disparity, with higher prevalence and poorer outcomes in people with SMI.
AIM: To determine the impact of SMI on healthcare processes and outcomes for 
people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective, observational, matched, nested, case-control 
study conducted in England using patient records from the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics.
METHOD: A range of healthcare processes (primary care consultations, physical 
health checks, and metabolic measurements) and outcomes (prevalence and 
hospitalisation for cardiovascular disease [CVD], and mortality risk) were 
compared for 2192 people with SMI and T2DM (cases) with 7773 people who had 
diabetes alone (controls). Sociodemographics, comorbidity, and medication 
prescription were covariates in regression models.
RESULTS: When compared with results for participants with T2DM only, SMI was 
associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.919, 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.602 to 2.300) and CVD-specific mortality (HR 
2.242, 95% CI = 1.547 to 3.250), higher primary care physician consultation 
rates (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.149, 95% CI = 1.111 to 1.188), more-frequent 
checks of blood pressure (IRR 1.024, 95% CI = 1.003 to 1.046) and cholesterol 
(IRR 1.038, 95% CI = 1.019 to 1.058), lower prevalence of angina (odds ratio 
0.671, 95% CI = 0.450 to 1.001), more emergency admissions for angina (IRR 
1.532, 95% CI = 1.069 to 2.195), and fewer elective admissions for ischaemic 
heart disease (IRR 0.682, 95% CI = 0.508 to 0.915).
CONCLUSION: Monitoring of metabolic measurements was comparable for people with 
T2DM who did, and did not, have SMI. Increased mortality rates observed in 
people with SMI may be attributable to underdiagnosis of CVD and delays in 
treatment.

AIMS: To provide the first systematic analysis of the burden and underlying 
causes of heart failure (HF) in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected detailed information on prevalence, years 
lived with disability (YLDs), and underlying causes of HF from the Global Burden 
of Disease study 2017. Numbers and age-standardized rates of HF prevalence and 
YLDs were compared by age, sex, socio-demographic index (SDI), and location. The 
proportions of HF age-standardized prevalence rates due to 23 underlying causes 
were also presented. Globally, the age-standardized prevalence and YLD rates of 
HF in 2017 were 831.0 and 128.2 per 100 000 people, a decrease of -7.2% and 
-0.9% from 1990, respectively. Nevertheless, the absolute numbers of HF 
prevalent cases and YLDs have increased by 91.9% and 106.0% from 1990, 
respectively. There is significant geographic and socio-demographic variation in 
the levels and trends of HF burden from 1990 to 2017. Among all causes of HF, 
ischaemic heart disease accounted for the highest proportion (26.5%) of 
age-standardized prevalence rate of HF in 2017, followed by hypertensive heart 
disease (26.2%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23.4%).
CONCLUSION: HF remains a serious public health problem worldwide, with 
increasing age-standardized prevalence and YLD rates in countries with 
relatively low SDI. More geo-specific strategies aimed at preventing underlying 
causes and improving medical care for HF are warranted to reduce the future 
burden of this condition.

Risk of Hospital Readmission among Older Patients Discharged from the 
Rehabilitation Unit in a Rural Community Hospital: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Rehabilitation for hospitalized older people can improve their independence for 
performing activities of daily living (ADL), but determining its appropriateness 
can be challenging because of inherent limitations in their ADL and short life 
expectancy. Thus, we aimed to clarify the benefit of rehabilitation among older 
Japanese patients. We retrospectively evaluated consecutive older patients (age 
> 65 years) admitted to the rehabilitation unit of a rural community hospital 
between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome measure was 
readmission for acute conditions. Of the 732 patients evaluated, 311 patients 
(42.5%) were readmitted. Readmission was significantly associated with body mass 
index (BMI) (p < 0.001), dependent condition (p < 0.001), higher cognitive 
domain scores in the functional independence measure (FIM) (p = 0.019), and 
polypharmacy (p = 0.026). The most frequent cause of readmission was 
pyelonephritis (11.9%), followed by pneumonia (10.9%), compression fracture 
(10.6%), heat stroke (8.4%), and cerebral stroke (8.0%). In conclusion, older 
Japanese patients discharged from rehabilitation units have lower readmission 
rates than those previously reported. Thus, better nutritional control, a 
multidisciplinary approach to the management of cognitive dysfunction, and a 
decrease in polypharmacy could be associated with improved outcomes among 
discharged older patients.

The influence of the preharvest application of chitosan on physicochemical 
properties and changes in gene expression of 'Garmrok' kiwifruit during 
postharvest cold storage (0 °C; RH 90-95%; 90 days) was investigated. Preharvest 
treatment of chitosan increased the fruit weight but had no significant effect 
on fruit size. The chitosan treatment suppressed the ethylene production and 
respiration rate of kiwifruit during the cold storage. The reduction of ethylene 
production of chitosan-treated kiwifruit was accompanied with the suppressed 
expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes. Moreover, preharvest application of 
chitosan diminished weight loss and delayed the changes in physicochemical 
properties that include firmness, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, 
total sugars, total acids, total phenols, and total lignin. As a result, the 
preharvest application of chitosan delayed the maturation and ripening of fruit. 
Expression of genes related to cell wall modification was down-regulated during 
the early maturation (ripening) period, while those related to gene expression 
for lignin metabolism were up-regulated at the later stages of ripening. These 
results demonstrate that the preharvest application of chitosan maintained the 
fruit quality and extends the postharvest life of 'Garmrok' kiwifruit, possibly 
through the modulation of genes related to ethylene biosynthesis, cell wall 
modification, and lignin metabolism.

Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) characterized by 
lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids in a wide variety of cytotypes, 
including endothelial cells (ECs). FD patients experience a significantly 
reduced life expectancy compared to the general population; therefore, the 
association with a premature aging process would be plausible. To assess this 
hypothesis, miR-126-3p, a senescence-associated microRNA (SA-miRNAs), was 
considered as an aging biomarker. The levels of miR-126-3p contained in small 
extracellular vesicles (sEVs), with about 130 nm of diameter, were measured in 
FD patients and healthy subjects divided into age classes, in vitro, in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) "young" and undergoing replicative 
senescence, through a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach. We 
confirmed that, in vivo, circulating miR-126 levels physiologically increase 
with age. In vitro, miR-126 augments in HUVECs underwent replicative senescence. 
We observed that FD patients are characterized by higher miR-126-3p levels in 
sEVs, compared to age-matched healthy subjects. We also explored, in vitro, the 
effect on ECs of glycosphingolipids that are typically accumulated in FD 
patients. We observed that FD storage substances induced in HUVECs premature 
senescence and increased of miR-126-3p levels. This study reinforces the 
hypothesis that FD may aggravate the normal aging process.

BACKGROUND: Breast milk is considered the optimal source of nutrition during 
infancy. Although the vitamin D concentration in human breast milk is generally 
considered poor for infants, vitamin D in breast milk is an important source for 
exclusively breastfed infants. Increases in vitamin D insufficiency and 
deficiency in lactating mothers may reduce vitamin D concentrations in breast 
milk. This study aimed to compare vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) 
concentrations in breast milk collected in 1989 and 2016-2017 and simultaneously 
analyze them with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); the 
association between the lifestyle of recent lactating mothers (2016-2017) and 
vitamin D status in human breast milk was also evaluated.
METHOD: Lactating mothers were recruited from three regions of Japan in 1989 (n 
= 72) and 2016-2017 (n = 90), and milk from 3-4 months was collected in summer 
and winter. The samples were strictly sealed and stored at -80℃ until 
measurement. Breast milk vitamin D and 25OHD concentrations were analyzed by 
LC-MS/MS. Vitamin D intake, sun exposure, and sunscreen use of the lactating 
mothers in 2016-2017 were assessed.
RESULTS: Both vitamin D and 25OHD concentrations in breast milk were higher in 
the summer regardless of the survey year. Significantly lower vitamin D and 
25OHD concentrations were observed in 2016-2017 compared with 1989 in summer, 
but no survey year difference was observed in winter. The stepwise multiple 
regression analyses identified season, daily outdoor activity, and suntan in the 
last 12 months as independent factors associated with vitamin D3 concentrations.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that low vitamin D status in recent lactating 
mothers may have decreased vitamin D and 25OHD concentrations in breast milk 
compared with the 1980s. These results are helpful for developing public health 
strategies to improve vitamin D status in lactating mothers and infants.

The associations among early childhood caries (ECC), socioeconomic status, and 
sugar consumption are of the utmost importance, due to their potential policy 
implications. The purpose of this study was to identify trends in ECC burden in 
children under 5 years old among European Union (EU) member states over time and 
to evaluate the relationship with its risk factors. Global Burden of Disease 
2019 data were analyzed to estimate the burden of ECC over time, specifically 
incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for children under 
5 years old. Four ecological variables with a potential effect on YLDs for ECC 
were used to investigate the association between 2014 and 2017. The YLDs rate 
was consistently higher among Eastern EU countries over time. Univariate models 
showed a positive significant association between at-risk-of-poverty rate and 
YLDs rate, while GDP per capita and urbanization were inversely associated with 
YLDs rate. In the multivariate analysis, sugar consumption, GDP per capita and 
urbanization showed significant association with YLDs rate. After stratification 
by region, association remained significant only in the Eastern EU countries 
between GDP, urbanization, and YLDs rate, while sugar consumption and 
at-risk-of-poverty rate had no significant impact on YLDs rates. This study 
found increasing ECC burden in the EU. The complexity of the problem indicates 
the need for innovative and personalized policy approaches to tackle the 
disease.

Prostate cancer incidence in young men has increased. Patients diagnosed at an 
earlier age are likely to have aggressive prostate cancer and treatment 
decisions are continuing to be weighted by patient age and life expectancy. 
Identification of age-associated gene-expression signatures hold great potential 
to augment current and future treatment modalities. To investigate age-specific 
tumor associated gene signatures and their potential biomarkers for disease 
aggressiveness, this study was designed and stratified into well and poorly 
differentiated tumor types of young (42-58 years) and old (66-73 years) prostate 
cancer patients. The differentially expressed genes related to tumor-normal 
differences between non-familial prostate cancer patients were identified and 
several genes uniquely associated with the age and tumor differentiation are 
markedly polarized. Overexpressed genes known to be associated with somatic 
genomic alterations was predominantly found in young men, such as TMPRESS2-ERG 
and c-MYC. On the other hand, old men have mostly down-regulated gene 
expressions indicating the loss of protective genes and reduced cell mediated 
immunity indicated by decreased HLA-A and HLA-B expression. The normalization 
for the benign signatures between the age groups indicates a significant age and 
tumor dependent heterogeneity exists among the patients with a great potential 
for age-specific and tumor differentiation-based therapeutic stratification of 
prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review will be to identify the characteristics 
(eg, type, duration, and provider) of family-oriented interventions in long-term 
care residential settings. The authors will also identify which outcomes are 
reported in the literature when implementing family-oriented interventions.
INTRODUCTION: An array of family-oriented interventions in long-term care 
residential settings exist. Given the heterogeneity of current literature, 
mapping characteristics and intended outcomes of family-oriented interventions 
is an essential step to inform how best to support families of patients in 
long-term care residential settings.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will consider studies describing family-oriented 
interventions for families of elderly patients in long-term care residential 
settings, with no exclusion based on country, gender, or comorbidities. 
Interventions that address any family-related issue, such as quality of life, 
psychological burden, and family involvement in patient care, are eligible for 
inclusion. Studies will be excluded if the patients are cared for at their own 
homes or institutionalized care is provided on a temporary basis. Quantitative, 
qualitative, and mixed method study designs will be considered for inclusion.
METHODS: A scoping review will be conducted using the JBI methodological 
approach. Seven databases will be systematically searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, 
Scopus, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews including Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, 
OpenGrey, and the Grey Literature Report. Citations will be screened against the 
inclusion criteria by two reviewers independently. Relevant data will be 
extracted from the included studies, and will be synthesized, summarized, and 
reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Findings will be published in a 
peer-reviewed journal.

Biodegradable films reinforced with bio-nanomaterials are a solution for 
developing active packaging systems, shelf-life extension and protection of 
environment against conventional packaging. This study aimed to characterize the 
biocompatible chitosan (CS) films formulated with nano-liposomal garlic 
essential oil (NLGEO) and assess the physicho-mechanical, morphology properties 
and also microbial and chemical changes in chicken fillets during storage time 
at 4 °C. NLGEO was obtained by thin-layer hydration-sonication method using 
glycerol and tween 80 as plasticizer and emulsifier, respectively. Different 
levels (0, 0.5, 1 and 2%) of NLGEO with average size of ~101 nm were added into 
the chitosan matrix and films fabricated by casting method. The average size, 
polydispersity index and zeta potential were ~101 nm, 0.127 and -7.23, 
respectively. Control samples showed higher values for pH, total volatile 
nitrogen (TVN), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 
(TBARS), and microbial count including total viable count (TVC), coliforms, 
Staphylococcus aureus and psychrotroph bacteria than treated samples. The films 
with higher NLGEO content represented stronger inhibitory effects. The 
incorporation of NLGEO improved the mechanical properties and water resistance 
of active films. Microstructure analysis also showed a nearly smooth surface 
morphology and homogenous structure with a good dispersion for NLGEO films. 
Significant synergistic effects in chemical and bacterial preservation of 
chicken fillet samples were observed by NLGEO films. The optimal mechanical and 
barrier properties of chitosan-NLGEO films introduced it a potential active 
packaging to extend the shelf life of chicken fillet.

Almost no research has examined factors that contribute to mortality risk among 
sexual minority women (SMW). This study capitalizes on a 21-year community-based 
longitudinal study of SMW to examine the association between sexual identity 
disclosure and mortality risk. Forty-nine SMW who were recruited in 2000-01 or 
2010-12 (6.3% of the sample), were confirmed dead by 2019. The mean age at death 
was 56.5 years. We used Cox proportional hazard models to show that SMW who had 
disclosed their sexual identity to 100% of their immediate family members had a 
70% reduction in the risk of mortality compared to SMW who disclosed to less 
than 33% of their immediate family, after adjusting for several sociodemographic 
and health variables. Our results suggest that facilitating acceptance of SMW 
and their ability to disclose their identity may be an important way to improve 
health and life expectancy among SMW.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical deformity (CD) patients have severe disability and poor 
health status. However, little is known about how patients with rigid CD compare 
with those with flexible CD. The main objectives of this study were to 1) assess 
whether patients with rigid CD have worse baseline alignment and therefore 
require more aggressive surgical corrections and 2) determine whether patients 
with rigid CD have similar postoperative outcomes as those with flexible CD.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of a prospective, multicenter CD 
database. Rigid CD was defined as cervical lordosis (CL) change < 10° between 
flexion and extension radiographs, and flexible CD was defined as a CL change ≥ 
10°. Patients with rigid CD were compared with those with flexible CD in terms 
of cervical alignment and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at baseline and 
at multiple postoperative time points. The patients were also compared in terms 
of surgical and intraoperative factors such as operative time, blood loss, and 
number of levels fused.
RESULTS: A total of 127 patients met inclusion criteria (32 with rigid and 95 
with flexible CD, 63.4% of whom were females; mean age 60.8 years; mean BMI 
27.4); 47.2% of cases were revisions. Rigid CD was associated with worse 
preoperative alignment in terms of T1 slope minus CL, T1 slope, C2-7 sagittal 
vertical axis (cSVA), and C2 slope (C2S; all p < 0.05). Postoperatively, 
patients with rigid CD had an increased mean C2S (29.1° vs 22.2°) at 3 months 
and increased cSVA (47.1 mm vs 37.5 mm) at 1 year (p < 0.05) compared with those 
with flexible CD. Patients with rigid CD had more posterior levels fused (9.5 vs 
6.3), fewer anterior levels fused (1 vs 2.0), greater blood loss (1036.7 mL vs 
698.5 mL), more 3-column osteotomies (40.6% vs 12.6%), greater total osteotomy 
grade (6.5 vs 4.5), and mean osteotomy grade per level (3.3 vs 2.1) (p < 0.05 
for all). There were no significant differences in baseline HRQOL scores, the 
rate of distal junctional kyphosis, or major/minor complications between 
patients with rigid and flexible CD. Both rigid and flexible CD patients 
reported significant improvements from baseline to 1 year according to the 
numeric rating scale for the neck (-2.4 and -2.7, respectively), Neck Disability 
Index (-8.4 and -13.3, respectively), modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association 
score (0.1 and 0.6), and EQ-5D (0.01 and 0.05) (p < 0.05). However, HRQOL 
changes from baseline to 1 year did not differ between rigid and flexible CD 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rigid CD have worse baseline cervical malalignment 
compared with those with flexible CD but do not significantly differ in terms of 
baseline disability. Rigid CD was associated with more invasive surgery and more 
aggressive corrections, resulting in increased operative time and blood loss. 
Despite more extensive surgeries, rigid CD patients had equivalent improvements 
in HRQOL compared with flexible CD patients. This study quantifies the 
importance of analyzing flexion-extension images, creating a prognostic tool for 
surgeons planning CD correction, and counseling patients who are considering CD 
surgery.

As life expectancy is increasing, elderly patients are evaluated more frequently 
for resection of benign or malignant pancreatic lesions. However, the impact of 
age on postoperative morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs in octogenarian 
patients (≥80 years) undergoing major pancreatic surgery needs further 
investigation. The clinicopathological data of patients who underwent pancreatic 
surgery between January 2015 and March 2019 in a major hepatopancreatobiliary 
center in Switzerland were assessed. Postoperative outcomes and hospital costs 
of octogenarians and younger patients were compared in univariate and 
multivariate regression analysis. During the study period, 346 patients 
underwent pancreatic resection. Pancreatoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, 
total pancreatectomy, and other procedures were performed in 54%, 20%, 13%, and 
13% of patients, respectively. The major postoperative morbidity rate and 
postoperative mortality rate were 25% and 3.5%, respectively. A total of 39 
patients (11%) were ≥80 years old, and 307 patients were <80 years old. The 
majority of octogenarians suffered from ductal adenocarcinoma, whereas among 
younger patients, other indications for a pancreatic resection were predominant 
(ductal adenocarcinoma 64% vs. 41%, p = 0.006). Age ≥80 was associated with more 
frequent postoperative medical (pulmonary, cardiovascular) and surgical 
(high-grade pancreatic fistula, postoperative hemorrhage) complications. 
Postoperative mortality was significantly higher in octogenarians (15.4% vs. 2%, 
p < 0.0001). This finding may be explained by the higher rate of type C
