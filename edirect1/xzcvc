OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to systematically review published evidence on the 
construct validity, test-retest reliability and responsiveness of generic 
preference-based measures (PBMs) used in East and South-East Asia.
METHODS: This systematic review was guided by the COSMIN guideline. A literature 
search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and PubMed databases up to August 2019 
was conducted for measurement properties validation papers of the EuroQol-5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Form-6 Dimensions (SF-6D), Health Utilities Index 
(HUI), Quality of Well-Being (QWB), 15-Dimensional (15D) and Assessment of 
Quality of Life (AQOL) in East and South-East Asian countries. Included papers 
were disaggregated into individual studies whose results and quality of design 
were rated separately. The population-specific measurement properties (construct 
validity, test-retest reliability and responsiveness) of each PBM were assessed 
separately using relevant studies. The overall methodological quality of the 
studies used in each of the assessments was also rated.
RESULTS: A total of 79 papers containing 1504 studies were included in this 
systematic review. The methodological quality was 'very good' or 'adequate' for 
the majority of the construct validity studies (99%) and responsiveness studies 
(61%), but for only a small portion of the test-retest reliability studies 
(23%). EQ-5D was most widely assessed and was found to have 'sufficient' 
construct validity and responsiveness in many populations, while the SF-6D and 
EuroQol-Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) exhibited 'inconsistent' construct validity 
in some populations. Scarce evidence was available on HUI and QWB, but current 
evidence supported the use of HUI.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a summary of the quality of 
existing generic PBMs in Asian populations. The current evidence supports the 
use of EQ-5D as the preferred choice when a generic PBM is needed, and 
continuous testing of all PBMs in the region.

College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.

BACKGROUND: Differing methodological requirements and decision-making criteria 
are recognised as barriers to transferability of cost-effectiveness analysis 
(CEA) across jurisdictions.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the generic and specific transferability of published 
CEAs of systemic treatments for advanced melanoma to the Irish setting.
METHODS: CEAs of treatments for melanoma were identified by systematic review. 
Transferability to the Irish setting was assessed using the EUnetHTA 
transferability tool for Economic Evaluation. We present a narrative discussion 
comparing the differences in key parameter inputs and the likely impact of these 
differences on the model outcomes and the reimbursement recommendation. 
Transferability is considered within the context of the Irish cost-effectiveness 
threshold, using the net monetary benefit (NMB) framework.
RESULTS: No published CEAs (n = 15) aligned with the Irish reference case for 
CEA. Changes to key parameters were unlikely to change the conclusions of the 
CEA when the cost-effectiveness threshold was considered. Ten studies (19 
pairwise comparisons) were compared with findings by the National Centre for 
Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) using NMB. Without accounting for differences in the 
cost-effectiveness threshold, there was alignment between the study conclusions 
and NCPE recommendations in 73.7% cases. When the Irish cost-effectiveness 
threshold was applied in the estimation of NMB, there was agreement in 89.5% of 
cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Alignment in methodological requirements for CEA is important to 
facilitate joint health technology assessment (HTA) by regional collaborations 
in Europe. When parameter inputs are not exactly aligned, conclusions may still 
be comparable across jurisdictions. For international joint procurement 
initiatives, determining and implementing joint decision rules may be more 
important than trying to align rules regarding methodological and parameter 
inputs.

Mental health is biological health: Why tackling "diseases of the mind" is an 
imperative for biological anthropology in the 21st century.

Washington.

The germ theory of disease and the attendant public health initiatives, 
including sanitation, vaccination, and antibiotic treatment, led to dramatic 
increases in global life expectancy. As the prevalence of infectious disease 
declines, mental disorders are emerging as major contributors to the global 
burden of disease. Scientists understand little about the etiology of mental 
disorders, however, and many of the most popular psychopharmacological 
treatments, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, have only 
moderate-to-weak efficacy in treating symptoms and fail to target biological 
systems that correspond to discrete psychiatric syndromes. Consequently, despite 
dramatic increases in the treatment of some mental disorders, there has been no 
decrease in the prevalence of most mental disorders since accurate record 
keeping began. Many researchers and theorists are therefore endeavoring to 
rethink psychiatry from the ground-up. Anthropology, especially biological 
anthropology, can offer critical theoretical and empirical insights to combat 
mental illness globally. Biological anthropologists are unique in that we take a 
panhuman approach to human health and behavior and are trained to address each 
of Tinbergen's four levels of analysis as well as culture. The field is thus 
exceptionally well-situated to help resolve the mysteries of mental illness by 
integrating biological, evolutionary, and sociocultural perspectives.

We investigate the returns to college attendance in Canada in terms of health 
and mortality reduction. To do so, we first use a dynamic health microsimulation 
model to document how interventions that incentivize college attendance among 
high school graduates may impact their health trajectory, health care 
consumption, and life expectancy. We find large returns both in terms of evity 
(4.1 years additional years at age 51), reduction in the prevalence of various 
health conditions (10-15 percentage points reduction in diabetes and 5 
percentage points for stroke), and health care consumption (27.3% reduction in 
lifetime hospital stays, 19.7 for specialists). We find that education impacts 
mortality mostly by delaying the incidence of health conditions as well as 
providing a survival advantage conditional on having diseases. Second, we 
provide quasi-experimental evidence on the impact of college attendance on 
long-term health outcomes by exploiting the Canadian Veteran's Rehabilitation 
Act, a program targeted towards returning WW-II veterans and which incentivized 
college attendance. The impact on mortality is found to be larger than those 
estimated from the health microsimulation model (hazard ratio of 0.216 compared 
with 0.6 in the simulation model), which suggests substantial returns to college 
education in terms of healthy life extension which we estimate to be 
approximately one million canadian dollars.

Ubiquitin expression protein DNA clone (Hl-UBI) was isolated from Heterodera 
latipons collected from North Jordan. Its sequence of 285 nucleotides was also 
determined and deposited in the GeneBank. The 285-bp open reading frame coded 
for 76-amino acid protein having two domains; the ubiquitin domain and the C 
terminal extension. The first 59 amino acids were predicted with the ubiquitin 
domain with identity percentages of 78% to ubiquitin of H. schachtii, 77% to 
polyubiquitin of Globodera pallida, 74% to ubiquitin of Globodera rostochiensis 
and 72% to ubiquitin of Heterodera glycines. The other domain at the C-terminus, 
containing 17 amino acids, showed no homology to any known protein. Sequence 
analysis showed a calculated encoding amino acids molecular weight of 8.77 kDa, 
theoretical isoelectric point = 4.76, negatively charged residues = 12, 
positively charged residues = 9, extinction coefficient = 1490, estimated 
half-life = 30 h, instability index = 32.51 and grand average of 
hydropathicity = -0.537. The demonstrated subcellular localization analysis of 
cytoplasm, cell nucleus, mitochondrion, cell skeleton and plasma membrane of 
Hl-UBI protein occupied about 52.20, 21.70, 17.40, 4.30 and 4.30%, respectively. 
Sequence, homology and structural analysis confirmed that Hl-UBI gene was highly 
conserved during evolution and belonged to ubiquitin gene family.

INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous dissection of the coronary arteries is relatively rare 
and usually does not affect life expectancy. However specific types have been 
implicated to episodes of sudden cardiac death and myocardial ischemia. The 
recognition of both clinical and imaging characteristics contributes to 
appropriate decision and patient management.
AIM: The aim of the study is the epidemiological and Coronary Angiographic (CA) 
estimation of patients with spontaneous dissection of the coronary arteries, who 
were hospitalized in the cardiology department with Acute Coronary Syndrome or 
were submitted to coronary angiographic examination in the laboratory.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The epidemiological, clinical and angiographic data of 31 
patients who were hospitalized in our department and suffered from spontaneous 
dissection of the coronary vessels were studied retrospectively.
RESULTS: In 31 patients (11 men and 20 women, mean age 52.8+18.6 years) who were 
hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), spontaneous dissection of 
coronary arteries was detected. Precipitating factors were hypertension in 12 
patients (38.71%), dyslipidemia in 13 patients (42%) and smoking in 17 patients 
(54.84%). Among the women, 13 (65%) had a history of hypertension in pregnancy, 
preeclampsia or/and gestational diabetes. In 8 patients, the coronary 
angiography showed multivessel disease, while in 12 patients there were no 
significant lesions in the coronary vessels. Fourteen women (70%) reported a 
history of depression compared to none in men.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of spontaneous dissection of the coronary vessels in 
this sample of patients from northern Greece is similar to that of the other 
centers. The incidence is greater in females with hormonal changes and 
depression. In a large number there were no significant atherosclerotic lesions.

Improvement of gluten-free bread and cake properties using natural 
hydrocolloids: A review.

Salehi F(1).

Author information:

University Hamedan Iran.

The main wheat component responsible for bread and cake quality is gluten. 
Celiac disease is an autoimmune digestive disease that is caused by the 
digestion of gluten, and the only treatment of this disease is a gluten-free 
diet. Various gluten-free formulations (composite and wheatless flours) have 
applied gums (as gluten substitutes) to mimic the viscoelastic properties of 
gluten. In the bakery products, gums have been used to improve dough 
performance, bread and cake characteristics, textural and sensorial quality, and 
extension the products shelf life. This paper reviews the effect of the most 
common and new hydrocolloids (balangu seed, wild sage seed, basil seed, cress 
seed, xanthan, guar, starch carrageenan, methylcellulose, carboxy methyl 
cellulose, hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose, and locust bean gums) on the 
rheological, physicochemical, textural, and quality characteristics of 
gluten-free breads and cakes. Gums affect gelatinization and retrogradation of 
starch through a strong association of amylose with gum, resulting in a decrease 
in the retrogradation of starch. Gums addition increased volume and porosity of 
the breads and cakes and resulted in softer products.

Author information:

Copenhagen, Denmark.

Background: The pension age in Denmark is adjusted in line with projected 
increasing life expectancy without taking health differentials between 
occupational groups into account. The purpose was to study occupational 
disparities in partial life expectancy and health expectancy between the ages of 
50 and 75. Methods: Register data on occupation and mortality were combined with 
data from the Danish part of Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe 
in 2010-2014 (N=3179). Expected lifetime without and with activity limitations 
and without and with long-term illness was estimated by Sullivan's method and 
comparisons made between four occupational groups. Results: We found clear 
differences between occupational groups. Expected lifetime without activity 
limitations between the ages of 50 and 75 was about 4.5 years longer for men and 
women in high skilled white-collar occupations than for men and women in low 
skilled blue-collar occupations. Men in high skilled blue-collar and low skilled 
white-collar occupations could expect 2.3 and 3.8 years shorter lifetimes 
without activity limitations, respectively, than men in high skilled 
white-collar occupations. For women in low skilled white-collar occupations, 
lifetime without activity limitations was 2.6 years shorter than for women in 
high skilled white-collar occupations. Due to few observations, no results were 
obtained for women in the high skilled blue-collar group. The social gradient 
was also significant when health was measured by years without long-term 
illness. Conclusions: The results support implementation of a flexible pension 
scheme to take into account the health differentials between occupational 
groups.

This study aims to define comparability of 2016 statistics between Global Health 
Estimates (GHE) and Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) registries for 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality of the 25 most frequent 
worldwide malignancies. An excellent correlation can be found between the two 
registries for both cancer DALYs (r = 0.988) and mortality (r = 0.993). 
Cancer-related DALYs are substantially equivalent (mean bias, -1.9%; P = 0.603), 
while cancer mortality is modestly but significantly overestimated in GDHx (mean 
bias, 9.1%; P = 0.004). These results suggest that cancer DALYs estimate appear 
almost overlapping between GHE and GHDx registries, while cancer mortality is 
slightly overestimated in GDHx.

Integral membrane proteins mediate a myriad of cellular processes and are the 
target of many therapeutic drugs. Enhancement and extension of the functional 
scope of membrane proteins can be realized by membrane incorporation of 
engineered nanoparticles designed for specific diagnostic and therapeutic 
applications. In contrast to hydrophobic insertion of small amphiphilic 
molecules, delivery and membrane incorporation of particles on the nanometric 
scale poses a crucial barrier for technological development. In this 
perspective, the transformative potential of biomimetic membrane proteins 
(BMPs), current state of the art, and the barriers that need to be overcome in 
order to advance the field are discussed.

[Main methodological approaches to the identification and diagnosis of monogenic 
hereditary diseases and problems in the organization of medical care and unified

In order to optimize economic and organizational technologies for the provision 
of medical care to the population and to increase the effectiveness of 
preventive programs, an analysis of the accumulated morbidity and prevalence of 
monogenic hereditary diseases (MHDs) has been carried out in 13 federal subjects 
of the Russian Federation representing 11 ethnic groups: Russians of 6 regions, 
Tatars, Maris, Chuvashs, Bashkirs, Udmurts, Abazins, Adygeans, Nogays, 
Circassians and Karachays. The study of the population was carried out according 
to the developed protocol of complex genetic and epidemiological studies in the 
Research Center for Medical Genetics, which remains unchanged throughout the 
study. Here we have studied the structure of the genetic load and diversity of 
MHDs depending on the prevalence of diseases and in accordance with the 
classification by organ and system types of disease: neurological, 
ophthalmological, genodermatosis, skeletal, hereditary syndromes, and other 
hereditary pathology (metabolic hereditary diseases, disorders of blood, 
hearing, etc.). It is shown that the maximum number of patients (61.81%) falls 
in the group of frequent forms of MHDs, which differ by federal subjects / 
ethnic groups of the Russian Federation. There are frequent forms of MHDs for 
all populations, and "specific" forms for particular federal subjects of the 
Russian Federation/ethnic groups. Only for a small group of hereditary diseases 
there is treatment. Most of the detected diseases-psychiatric, neurological, 
hematological, and hereditary syndromes-significantly reduce life expectancy. 
Hereditary diseases of the skeleton, eyes, ears and metabolism affect the 
quality of life, adaptation in society and public health. On average, 65% of 
patients are diagnosed with MHDs for the first time. This situation implies 
changes in medical thinking, changes in education and development of both common 
for all regions and specific prevention programs. Thus, fundamental research in 
medicine can improve the quality of medical services and contribute to the 
improvement of public health.

Cervical cancer screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing has been 
incorporated into El Salvador's national guidelines. The feasibility of 
home-based HPV self-collection among women who do not attend screening at the 
clinic (i.e., non-attenders) has been demonstrated, but cost-effectiveness has 
not been evaluated. Using cost and compliance data from El Salvador, we informed 
a mathematical microsimulation model of HPV infection and cervical 
carcinogenesis to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal 
perspective. We estimated the reduction in cervical cancer risk, lifetime cost 
per woman (2017 US$), life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER, 2017 US$ per year of life saved [YLS]) of a program with home-based 
self-collection of HPV (facilitated by health promoters) for the 18% of women 
reluctant to screen at the clinic. The model was calibrated to epidemiologic 
data from El Salvador. We evaluated health and economic outcomes of the 
self-collection intervention for women aged 30 to 59 years, alone and in concert 
with clinic-based HPV provider-collection. Home-based self-collection of HPV was 
projected to reduce population cervical cancer risk by 14% and cost $1210 per 
YLS compared to no screening. An integrated program reaching 99% coverage with 
both provider- and home-based self-collection of HPV reduced cancer risk by 74% 
(compared to no screening), and cost $1210 per YLS compared to 
provider-collection alone. Self-collection facilitated by health promoters is a 
cost-effective strategy for increasing screening uptake in El Salvador.

In the UK, life extending, end-of-life (EoL) treatments are an exception to 
standard cost-per-quality-adjusted life year (QALY) thresholds. This implies 
that greater value is placed on gaining these QALYs, than QALYs gained by the 
majority of other patient groups treated for anything else in the health system, 
even for other EoL contexts (such as quality of life (QoL) improvements alone). 
This paper reports a Person Trade-Off (PTO) study to test whether studies that 
find societal support for prioritising EoL life extensions can be explained by 
the severity, in terms of prospective QALYs loss, of the non-terminal comparator 
scenarios. Eight health scenarios were designed depicting i) QoL improvements 
for non-EoL temporary (T-QoL) and chronic (C-QoL) health problems and ii) QoL 
improvements and life extensions (LEs) for EoL health problems. Preferences were 
elicited from a quota sample of 901 Scottish respondents in 2016 using PTO 
techniques via Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI). Our results indicate 
that there is little evidence to suggest that the severity of non-EoL comparator 
scenarios influence preferences for EoL treatments. Respondents do not appear to 
have a preference for EoL over non-EoL health gains; instead there is some 
indication that non-EoL health gains are preferred, particularly when compared 
to EoL-LE health gains. Comparing between QoL and life extending EoL scenarios, 
our results suggest QoL improvements are preferred to life extensions. Overall, 
results challenge current UK EoL policy which gives additional weight to EoL 
health gains, particularly EoL life extensions in the case of the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL chimeric tyrosine 
kinase, which is derived from the reciprocal translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11). 
BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can provide prolonged overall survival 
in CML patients, resulting in life expectancy nearly to general population, and 
now approximately half of patients who achieved deep molecular response (DMR) 
can sustain durable molecular remission after discontinuation TKIs. However, 
residual leukemic cells still detected in the patients who sustained in 
molecular remission after discontinuation TKIs with the sensitive BCL-ABL1 
transcript detection method. Given the fact that residual leukemic cells can 
exist in these patients, host immune systems can protect the patients to develop 
CML progression derived from residual leukemic cells. The human immune system is 
generally composed by innate and adaptive immune systems, corresponding to their 
functional diversities. Natural killer (NK) cells are major components of the 
innate immune system, while T lymphocytes (T cells) are major components of the 
adaptive immune system, and both NK cell and T cell mediate immune responses 
have an important role in CML. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that 
promote expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), leading to host immune 
suppression, are also important. Although regulation mechanism of these immune 
system has not been fully elucidated, tumor antigen (e.g. Wilms tumor-1), and 
surface receptors (e.g. killer immunoglobulin-like receptor and natural killer 
group 2) on NK cells, are pivotal role in these immune system regulations. 
Hence, we reviewed the current the immunological analysis, especially T cell and 
NK cell immunity in CML.

Cancer is one of the foremost causes of death globally and also the major 
stumbling block of increasing life expectancy. Although the primary treatment of 
surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have greatly reduced the 
mortality of cancer, the survival rate is still low because of the metastasis of 
tumor, a range of adverse drug reactions, and drug resistance. For all this, it 
is relevant to mention that a growing amount of research has shown the 
anticarcinogenic effect of phytochemicals which can modulate the molecular 
pathways and cellular events include apoptosis, cell proliferation, migration, 
and invasion. However, their pharmacological potential is hindered by their low 
water solubility, low stability, poor absorption, and rapid metabolism. In this 
scenario, the development of nanotechnology has created novel formulations to 
maximize the potential use of phytochemicals in anticancer treatment. 
Nanocarriers can enhance the solubility and stability of phytochemicals, prolong 
their half-life in blood and even achieve site-targeting delivery. This review 
summarizes the advances in utilizing nanoparticles in cancer therapy. In 
particular, we introduce several applications of nanoparticles combined with 
apigenin, resveratrol, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 6-gingerol, and 
quercetin in cancer treatment.

Background and objectives: Patients suffering from bone metastasis are at high 
risk for pathological fractures and especially hip fractures. Osteolytic 
metastases can induce a high morbidity rate (i.e., pain, facture risk, mobility 
impairment), and operation on them can be difficult in this frail population 
having a reduced life expectancy. Several medical devices have been investigated 
for the prevention of these pathological hip fractures. Materials and Methods: 
To investigate these solutions, a literature review and a meta-analysis of 
primary studies was performed. Data sources included electronic databases 
(PubMed, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov) from 1990 until 1 January 2019. Titles, 
abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed in order to select only studies 
evaluating the performance of the studied solution to prevent osteoporotic 
and/or pathological hip fracture. The main outcomes were the occurrence of hip 
fracture, pain evaluation (VAS score) and adverse events occurrence (including 
severe adverse events and deaths). All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
cohort studies were considered. A Bayesian cumulative meta-analysis was 
undertaken on the primary studies conducted in patients with bone metastasis. 
Results: A total of 12 primary studies were identified, all were cohort studies 
without a control group, and one compared two devices, and were thereafter 
considered separately. In those 12 samples, 255 patients were included, mean age 
61.7 years. After implantation, the cumulative risk of fracture was 5.5% (95% 
confidence interval, 3.0% to 8.6%), and adverse event occurrence was 17.4% 
(95%CI, 12.6 to 22.8%), with a median follow-up of 10 months. The posterior 
probability of a fracture rate below 5% was 40.3%. Conclusions: The literature 
about medical devices evaluation for preventing hip fractures in metastatic 
patients is poor and mostly based on studies with a limited level of evidence. 
However, this systematic review shows promising results in terms of efficacy and 
tolerance of these devices in patients with bone metastases. This treatment 
strategy requires further investigations.

Gene Networks (GN), have emerged as an useful tool in recent years for the 
analysis of different diseases in the field of biomedicine. In particular, GNs 
have been widely applied for the study and analysis of different types of 
cancer. In this context, Lung carcinoma is among the most common cancer types 
and its short life expectancy is partly due to late diagnosis. For this reason, 
lung cancer biomarkers that can be easily measured are highly demanded in 
biomedical research. In this work, we present an application of gene 
co-expression networks in the modelling of lung cancer gene regulatory networks, 
which ultimately served to the discovery of new biomarkers. For this, a robust 
GN inference was performed from microarray data concomitantly using three 
different co-expression measures. Results identified a major cluster of genes 
involved in SRP-dependent co-translational protein target to membrane, as well 
as a set of 28 genes that were exclusively found in networks generated from 
cancer samples. Amongst potential biomarkers, genes N C K A P 1 L and D M D are 
highlighted due to their implications in a considerable portion of lung and 
bronchus primary carcinomas. These findings demonstrate the potential of GN 
reconstruction in the rational prediction of biomarkers.

PURPOSE: The majority of patients with glaucoma do not take their medications as 
prescribed. Estimates of the cost-utility value of adherence to prescribed 
glaucoma medication are vital to implement potentially effective interventions.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using Monte Carlo microsimulations incorporating a 
series of Markov cycles (10 000 iterations per strategy).
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with glaucoma aged ≥40 years with a full lifetime horizon 
(up to 60 years).
METHODS: The analysis estimated glaucomatous progression on the basis of data 
from the United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study. Participants with glaucoma 
entered the model at age 40 years with a mean deviation in the better-seeing eye 
of -1.4±-1.9 decibels (dB) and -4.3±-3.4 dB in the worse-seeing eye. 
Participants whose glaucoma worsened each year accumulate -0.8 dB loss compared 
with -0.1 dB loss for those who remained stable. Data from the Glaucoma Laser 
Trial and the Tube versus Trabeculectomy Studies were used to assign 
probabilities of worsening disease among treated patients. Claims data 
estimating rates of glaucoma medication adherence over 4 years were used to 
assign probability of adherence. Those with poor adherence were modeled as 
having outcomes similar to the placebo arm of the clinical trials. As patients' 
mean deviation deteriorated, they transitioned between health states from mild 
(≥-6 dB), to moderate (<-6 to ≥-12 dB), to severe glaucoma (<-12 to ≥23 dB), to 
unilateral (<-20 dB) and bilateral blindness. At each health state, patients 
incurred the costs of treatment and established health utilities; ultimately, 
societal costs of low vision and blindness were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of glaucoma 
medication adherence.
RESULTS: Beginning at an initial glaucoma diagnosis at age 40 years, patients 
proceeded to single-eye blindness as early as 19 years among those who were 
nonadherent and 23 years for those remaining adherent. Total healthcare costs 
for adherent patients averaged $62 782 (standard deviation [SD], 34 107), and 
those for nonadherent patients averaged $52 722 (SD, 38 868). Nonadherent 
patients had a mean loss of 0.34 QALYs, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio 
of $29 600 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: At a conservative willingness to pay of $50 000/QALY, there is room 
to expand services to improve patient adherence.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 9-valent human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer in China.
DESIGN: Health economic modelling using the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for 
Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model populated with China-specific data.
SETTING: Individual cervical cancer prevention in China using the 9-valent HPV 
vaccine from the perspective of private sector purchasers in relation to 
receiving other HPV vaccines and not receiving vaccination for 16-year-old girls 
in China who had not been previously infected with HPV.
PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable.
INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination using the 9-valent, the quadrivalent and the bivalent 
vaccines.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental costs per disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) prevented.
RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental costs per DALY prevented were, 
respectively, US$35 000 and US$50 455 compared with the quadrivalent and the 
bivalent vaccines, both of which were above the cost-effective threshold of 
US$25 920/DALY prevented. To be cost-effective in these comparisons, the 
9-valent vaccine should be priced at $550 and $450 for the full doses, 
respectively. To be highly cost-effective, the price thresholds were $435 and 
$335. The incremental costs per DALY prevented in relation to no vaccination was 
US$23 012, making the 9-valent vaccine marginally cost-effective. The results 
were robust in most one-way sensitivity analyses including changing vaccination 
age to 13 and 26 years.
CONCLUSIONS: At the current price, the 9-valent HPV vaccine is not 
cost-effective compared with the quadrivalent and the bivalent vaccines for 
young girls in China who had not been previously infected with HPV. Policymakers 
and clinicians should keep potential vaccine recipients informed about the 
economic profile of the 9-valent vaccine and carefully consider expanding its 
use in China at the current price.

The Chicken as a Model Organism to Study Heart Development.

Wittig JG(1), Münsterberg A(1).

Author information:

United Kingdom.

Heart development is a complex process and begins with the long-range migration 
of cardiac progenitor cells during gastrulation. This culminates in the 
formation of a simple contractile tube with multiple layers, which undergoes 
remodeling into a four-chambered heart. During this morphogenesis, additional 
cell populations become incorporated. It is important to unravel the underlying 
genetic and cellular mechanisms to be able to identify the embryonic origin of 
diseases, including congenital malformations, which impair cardiac function and 
may affect life expectancy or quality. Owing to the evolutionary conservation of 
development, observations made in nonamniote and amniote vertebrate species 
allow us to extrapolate to human. This review will focus on the contributions 
made to a better understanding of heart development through studying avian 
embryos-mainly the chicken but also quail embryos. We will illustrate the 
classic and recent approaches used in the avian system, give an overview of the 
important discoveries made, and summarize the early stages of cardiac 
development up to the establishment of the four-chambered heart.

Older Americans have experienced dramatic gains in life expectancy in recent 
decades, but an emerging literature reveals that these gains are accumulating 
mostly to those at the top of the income distribution. We explore how growing 
inequality in life expectancy affects lifetime benefits from Social Security, 
Medicare, and other programs and how this phenomenon interacts with possible 
program reforms. We first project that life expectancy at age 50 for males in 
the two highest income quintiles will rise by 7 to 8 years between the 1930 and 
1960 birth cohorts, but that the two lowest income quintiles will experience 
little to no increase over that time period. This divergence in life expectancy 
will cause the gap between average lifetime program benefits received by men in 
the highest and lowest quintiles to widen by $130,000 (in $2009) over this 
period. Finally we simulate the effect of Social Security reforms such as 
raising the normal retirement age and changing the benefit formula to see 
whether they mitigate or enhance the reduced progressivity resulting from the 
widening gap in life expectancy.

Spinal cord injury is a global problem. It is a devastating life altering 
condition that is associated with permanent disability and reduced life 
expectancy. Road traffic accident has been described in global literature as the 
commonest aetiology and second to it is falls. Identifying these factors have 
led to development of policies and advocacy to reduce these causes of spinal 
cord injuries. We present three cases of spinal cord injuries from unusual 
aetiologies viz-a-viz an accidental hanging which resulted in a C4 traumatic 
myelopathy Frankel A in a 30-year old artisan, playful neck manipulation in a 
23-year old male student, resulting in Brown-Sequard syndrome, which resolved 
with non-operative spinal cord injury management protocol over six weeks and a 
C4 traumatic myelopathy Frankel D with a 50% anterior listhesis of C4 on C5 in a 
50-year old man who sustained injuries from a choke hold 10 weeks prior to 
presentation. He recovered fully on non-operative management and discharged home 
Frankel E.
