BACKGROUND: Secukinumab has demonstrated significant efficacy with a good safety 
profile through 1 year in plaque psoriasis. Given the chronic nature of this 
disease, long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate psoriasis therapies fully.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term (3-year) efficacy and safety of 
secukinumab in moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
METHODS: Patients completing 52 weeks of secukinumab treatment in the SCULPTURE 
core study entered an extension in which they continued the same double-blind 
regimens. Dosing regimens included a fixed-interval schedule (FI; every 4 weeks) 
and retreatment as needed (RAN), in which patients were withdrawn from 
secukinumab and received placebo until the start of relapse, at which time 
secukinumab every 4 weeks was reinitiated. The study was registered with number 
NCT01640951.
RESULTS: In total 168 patients receiving secukinumab 300 mg FI and 172 receiving 
secukinumab 300 mg RAN entered the extension. Secukinumab 300 mg FI sustained 
high efficacy: at the end of year 3, the proportion of responders achieving ≥ 
90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) was 63·8%, and of 
PASI 100 responders it was 42·6%. The mean absolute PASI remained low (2-4) from 
week 52 to week 152 with 300 mg FI, with approximately two-thirds of patients 
reporting no impact of skin disease on their lives (Dermatology Life Quality 
Index of 0 or 1). Improvements in overall and subscale scores on all 
quality-of-life instruments were well sustained. As in the core study, FI dosing 
was consistently more efficacious than RAN. No new safety signals were 
identified to year 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Secukinumab 300 mg FI sustained high responses and improved quality 
of life with no new safety concerns through 3 years.

AIM: Poverty has often been associated with malnutrition, stunted growth, 
impaired cognitive development and poor earnings. We studied whether these 
associations were found in German men born and raised shortly after World War II 
during severe and long-standing nationwide malnutrition.
METHODS: We analysed German old-age pension payments, as a rough measure of 
lifetime earnings, in German men born from 1932 to 1960 and compared the 
at-risk-of-poverty rates of German men born in 1945-1948 versus 1935-1938 and 
1955-1958.
RESULTS: Substantially fewer women worked during this period and their longer 
life expectancy makes their pension payments difficult to interpret. We 
therefore limited our analysis to men. Men born in the 1930s received the 
highest monthly old-age pensions and these declined slightly in men born from 
1945 to 1948, indicating a minute impairment in work-related income in cohorts 
born shortly after the war. We also found that there was no evidence for 
increased at-risk-of-poverty rates in men born in 1945-1948 versus those born in 
1935-1938 and in 1955-1958.
CONCLUSION: Being born and raised following World War II was associated with a 
minute work and pension impairment that was not visible in the 
at-risk-of-poverty rates. These findings question statements associating early 
childhood nutrition and future lifetime earnings.

Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic genetic condition affecting connective 
tissue. It carries a reduced life expectancy, largely dependent on 
cardiovascular complications. More common cardiac manifestations such as aortic 
dissection and aortic valve incompetence have been widely documented in the 
literature. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), however, has remained poorly 
documented. This article aims at exploring the existing literature on the 
pathophysiology and diagnosis of MVP in patients with Marfan syndrome, defining 
its current management and outlining the future developments surrounding it.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only causal treatment for allergic 
diseases. However, the efficacy of immunotherapy may vary around the world due 
to differences in climate, the nature of aero-allergens and their distribution. 
The aim of this study was to describe the effects of subcutaneous immunotherapy 
(SCIT) in Korean adults with allergic asthma (AA). As a retrospective cohort 
study, we reviewed medical records for 627 patients with AA in Korea who were 
sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) and/or pollens and who underwent SCIT with 
aluminum hydroxide adsorbed allergen extract from 2000 to 2012. Rates of 
remission, defined as no further requirement of maintenance medication, over 
time were determined by means of life tables and extension of survival analysis. 
Herein, 627 asthmatic patients achieved remission within a mean of 4.7 ± 0.2 
years. The cumulative incidence rates of remission from AA were 86.9% upon 
treatment with SCIT. Baseline forced expiratory volume in the first second 
(FEV1) ≥ 80% (hazard ratio [HR], 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79-5.39; 
P < 0.001), and maintenance of immunotherapy for more than 3 years (HR, 1.82; 
95% CI, 1.21-2.72; P = 0.004) were significant predictors of asthma remission 
during SCIT. In 284 patients on SCIT with HDM alone, initial specific 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and 
Dermatophagoides farinae did not show significant difference between remission 
and non-remission group after adjusting demographic variables. In conclusion, 
SCIT was effective and safe treatment modality for patients with AA. Initial 
FEV1 ≥ 80% and immunotherapy more than 3 years were found to be associated with 
favorable clinical responses to SCIT.

Mesquite gum (MG) and nopal mucilage (NM) mixtures were used for 
microencapsulation of lemon essential oil (LEO) by spray drying. Emulsions of 
MG, NM and MG-NM mixtures (25-75, 50-50, 75-25) were evaluated according to the 
droplet size (1.49-9.16 μm), viscosity and zeta potential (-16.07 to -20.13 mV), 
and microcapsules were characterised in particle size (11.9-44.4 μm), 
morphology, volatile oil retention (VOR) (45.9-74.4%), encapsulation efficiency 
(EE) (70.9-90.6%), oxidative stability and thermal analysis. The higher 
concentration of MG led to smaller droplet sizes and lower viscosity in the 
emulsions, and smaller particle sizes with the highest VOR in microcapsules. The 
higher concentration of NM induced to higher viscosity in the emulsions, and 
larger particle sizes with the highest values of EE and oxidative stability in 
microcapsules. This work shows evidence that MG-NM mixtures can have synergic 
effect in desirable characteristics such as retention and shelf life extension 
of LEO in microcapsules.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is associated with a high mortality rate and requires 
emergent evaluation and surgical management. However, patients with chronic 
mesenteric ischemia can undergo either surgical or endovascular 
revascularization. Review of recent medical literature suggests lower rates of 
mortality and complications after endovascular revascularization, but higher 
rates of primary patency after surgical revascularization. The decision 
regarding method of revascularization in patients with chronic mesenteric 
ischemia should be based on the patient's vascular anatomy, comorbidities, and 
life expectancy.

With improved life expectancy and increased use of bioprosthetic heart valves, 
more elderly and frail patients present with degenerative surgical heart valve 
disease. The valve-in-valve procedure is an attractive alternative to a 
conventional open redo procedure. Although it is a novel extension of 
established transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe aortic stenosis 
in a high-risk population, it is gaining momentum worldwide, particularly for 
aortic and mitral positions. Success depends on the operator being familiar with 
emerging transcatheter heart valve technology and morphology as well as that of 
the existing surgical heart valve, patient selection, accurate sizing, an ideal 
implantation position.

Left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with transcatheter-delivered devices is an 
evolving story of compelling randomized data and the potential to dramatically 
reduce the incidence of stroke and improve the quality of life among patients 
with atrial fibrillation. Oral anticoagulation is the standard of care for 
stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation but falls short of providing an 
adequate solution to this common threat when considered from efficacy and safety 
perspectives. The robust series of Watchman device trials has demonstrated the 
Watchman device to provide stroke prevention efficacy similar to that of 
warfarin and by extension provides proof of concept of LAA closure.

BACKGROUND: This paper joins the debate over changes in the role of health 
professionals when applying advance directives to manage the decision-making 
process at the end of life care. Issues in relation to advance directives occur 
in clinical units in Lithuania; however, it remains one of the few countries in 
the European Union (EU) where the discussion on advance directives is not 
included in the health-care policy-making agenda. To encourage the discussion of 
advance directives, a study was designed to examine health professionals' 
understanding and preferences related to advance directives. In addition, the 
study sought to explore the views of health care professionals of the 
application of Advance Directives (AD) in clinical practice in Lithuania.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by interviewing 478 health 
professionals based at major health care centers in Kaunas district, Lithuania. 
The design of the study included the use of a questionnaire developed for this 
study and validated by a pilot study. The collected data were analyzed using 
standard descriptive statistical methods.
RESULTS: The analysis of knowledge about AD revealed some statistically 
significant differences when comparing the respondents' profession and gender. 
The analysis also indicated key emerging themes among respondents including 
tranquility of mind, the longest possible life expectancy and freedom of choice. 
Further, the study findings revealed that more than half of the study 
participants preferred to express their will while alive by using advance 
directives.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings revealed a low level of knowledge on advance 
directives among health professionals. Most health professionals agreed that 
AD's improved end-of-life decision making while the majority of physicians 
appreciated AD as the best tool for sharing responsibilities in clinical 
practice in Lithuania. More physicians than nurses preferred the presence of 
advance directives to support their decision making in end-of-life situations.

AIM: To present percutaneous image-guided screw-mediated osteosynthesis (PIGSMO) 
for fixation of impending fractures (ImF) and non-displaced/mildly displaced 
pathological/insufficient fractures (PF/InF) of the femoral neck in non-surgical 
cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a double-centre single-arm observational study. 
Retrospective review of electronic records identified all oncologic patients who 
had undergone femoral neck PIGSMO. Inclusion criteria were: non-displaced or 
mildly displaced PF/InF, and ImF (Mirels' score ≥8); life expectancy ≥1 month; 
unsuitability for surgical treatment due to sub-optimal clinical fitness, 
refusal of consent, or unacceptable delay to systemic therapy.
RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated (mean age 63.7±13.5 years) due to ImF 
(63.6%, mean Mirels' score 10.1), PF (27.3%) or post-radiation InF (9.1%) under 
CT/fluoroscopy- (36.4%) or CBCT- (63.6%) guidance. Thirty-two screws were 
implanted and cement injection was added in 36.4% cases. Technical success was 
90.9%. No procedure related complications were noted. At 1-month clinical 
follow-up (pain/walking impairment), 63.6% and 27.3% patients reported 
significant and mild improvement, respectively. Imaging follow-up (available in 
63.6% cases) showed no signs of secondary fractures, neither of screws loosening 
at mean 2.8 months. Five patients (45.5%) died after PIGSMO (mean time interval 
3.6 months).
CONCLUSIONS: PIGSMO is technically feasible and safe in cancer patients with 
limited life expectancy; it offers good short-term results. Further prospective 
studies are required to corroborate mid- and to prove long-term efficacy of the 
technique.

Progress In Achieving Health Equity Requires Attention To Root Causes.

Woolf SH(1).

Author information:
(1)Steven H. Woolf (swoolf@vcu.edu) is director of the Center on Society and 
Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond.

Life expectancy and disease rates in the United States differ starkly among 
Americans depending on their demographic characteristics and where they live. 
Although health care systems are taking important steps to reduce inequities, 
meaningful progress requires interventions outside the clinic, in sectors such 
as employment, housing, transportation, and public safety. Inequities exist in 
each of these sectors, and barriers to educational attainment, higher-income 
jobs, and social mobility limit the opportunity of disadvantaged people to 
improve their circumstances. Financial institutions and other stakeholders are 
investing in cross-sector collaborations to remove these barriers and thereby 
strengthen local economies and population health. Meanwhile, recent trends 
suggest the need to widen the lens on health equity, to include not only the 
low-income residents of inner-city neighborhoods but also people in economically 
marginalized rural communities. Widening income inequality and stagnant wages, 
and their alarming health consequences, underscore the need for policies to help 
low-income and middle-class families and improve educational opportunities for 
their children.

Bone is a frequent site of metastases and typically indicates a short-term 
prognosis in cancer patients. Once cancer has spread to the bones it can rarely 
be cured, but often it can still be treated to slow its growth. The majority of 
skeletal metastases are due to breast and prostate cancer. Bone metastasis is 
actually much more common than primary bone cancers, especially in adults. The 
diagnosis is based on signs, symptoms and imaging. New classes of drugs and new 
interventions are given a better quality of life to these patients and improved 
the expectancy of life. It is necessary a multidisciplinary approach to treat 
patients with bone metastasis. In this paper we review the types, clinical 
approach and treatment of bone metastases.

There is a growing interest in the optimizing care of acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS) in young patients, largely owing to their potential for longer life 
expectancy. Herein, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and 
outcome of young ACS patients (e.g. under 60 year old) from a Japanese 
multicenter percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) registry (KiCS-PCI). 
KiCS-PCI registered consecutive ACS patients from 15 institutions, and 1560 
(24.0%) out of 6499 ACS-related PCI involved patients aged <60 years. In this 
group, prevalence of dyslipidemia, smoking and family history of premature 
coronary artery disease (CAD) was higher, while the other classical risk factors 
were lower when compared to the old patients. After adjustment for known 
confounders, presentation with cardiogenic shock (CS) before PCI (OR 32.57, 95% 
CI 12.06-87.97), culprit lesion of LMT (OR 7.53, 95% CI 1.26-44.98), 
multi-vessel disease (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.37-10.63) and higher body mass index (OR 
1.12, 95% CI 1.00-1.24) showed association with higher in-hospital mortality in 
young patients. Multi-vessel disease (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9-8.9) and chronic kidney 
disease (OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.26-5.68) were associated with CS presentation. CS 
presentation was inversely associated with classical risk factors such as 
hypertension (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.96), family history of CAD (OR 0.49, 95% CI 
0.25-0.96), and dyslipidemia (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.71) and culprit lesion of 
RCA (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.94). Overall, ACS in the younger population was 
observed frequently, accounting for a quarter of ACS-related PCI. CS was a 
harbinger for in-hospital mortality in these patients.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare patient-reported outcomes 
(PROs), morbidity, and costs of TLIF vs PLF to determine whether one treatment 
was superior in the setting of single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis.
METHODS: Patients undergoing TLIF or PLF for single-level spondylolisthesis were 
included for retrospective analysis. EQ-5D, ODI, SF-12 MCS/PCS, NRS-BP/LP scores 
were collected at baseline and 24 months after surgery. 90-day post-operative 
complications, revision surgery rates, and satisfaction scores were also 
collected. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare 
payment amounts (direct cost). Patient and caregiver workday losses were 
multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). Total 
cost was used to assess mean total 2-year cost per QALYs gained after surgery.
RESULTS: 62 and 37 patients underwent TLIF and PLF, respectively. Patients in 
the PLF group were older (p < 0.01). No significant differences were seen in 
baseline or 24-month PROs between the two groups. There was a significant 
improvement in all PROs from baseline to 24 months after surgery (p < 0.001). 
Both groups had similar rates of 90-day complications, revision surgery, 
satisfaction, and similar gain in QALYs and cost per QALYs gained. There was no 
significant difference in 24-month direct, indirect, and total cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall costs and health care utilization were similar in both the 
groups. Both TLIF and PLF for single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis 
provide improvement in disability, pain, quality of life, and general health.

Increase in prevalence of obesity has become a worldwide major health problem in 
adults, as well as among children and adolescents. Furthermore, total adiposity 
and truncal subcutaneous fat accumulation during adolescence are positively and 
independently associated with atherosclerosis at adult ages. Centrally 
accumulation of body fat is associated with insulin resistance, whereas 
distribution of body fat in a peripheral pattern is metabolically less 
important. Obesity is associated with a large decrease in life expectancy. The 
effect of extreme obesity on mortality is greater among younger than older 
adults. In this respect, obesity is also associated with increased risk of 
several cancer types. However, up to 30% of obese patients are metabolically 
healthy with insulin sensitivity similar to healthy normal weight individuals, 
lower visceral fat content, and lower intima media thickness of the carotid 
artery than the majority of metabolically "unhealthy" obese patients.Abdominal 
obesity is the most frequently observed component of metabolic syndrome. The 
metabolic syndrome; clustering of abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia 
and hypertension, is a major public health challenge. The average prevalence of 
metabolic syndrome is 31%, and is associated with a two-fold increase in the 
risk of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and a 1.5-fold increase 
in the risk of all-cause mortality.

Obesity is a constantly growing health problem which reduces quality of life and 
life expectancy. Bariatric surgery for obesity is taken into account when all 
other conservative treatment modalities have failed. Comparison of the 
multidisciplinary programs with bariatric surgery regarding to weight loss 
showed that substantial and durable weight reduction have been achieved only 
with bariatric surgical treatments. However, the benefits of weight loss 
following bariatric procedures are still debated regarding the pro-inflammatory 
and metabolic profile of obesity.

A number of suggested measures of life years lost among patients with a given 
disease are reviewed, and some new ones are proposed. The methods are all 
phrased in the framework of a (Markov or non-Markov) illness-death model in 
combination with a population life table. The methods are illustrated using data 
on Danish male patients with bipolar disorder, and some recommendations are 
given. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (MPS1) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder 
caused by a deficiency in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-degrading enzyme 
α-l-iduronidase (IDUA). In affected patients, the systemic accumulation of GAGs 
results in skeletal dysplasia, neurological degeneration, multiple organ 
dysfunction, and early death. Current therapies, including enzyme replacement 
and bone marrow transplant, improve life expectancy but the benefits to skeletal 
and neurological phenotypes are limited. In this study, we tested the 
therapeutic efficacy of liver-directed transplantation of a placental stem cell, 
which possesses multilineage differentiation potential, low immunogenicity, and 
high lysosomal enzyme activity. Unfractionated human amniotic epithelial cells 
(hAECs) were transplanted directly into the liver of immunodeficient Idua 
knockout mouse neonates. The hAECs engraftment was immunohistochemically 
confirmed with anti-human mitochondria staining. Enzyme activity assays 
indicated that hAECs transplantation restored IDUA function in the liver and 
significantly decreased urinary GAG excretion. Histochemical and micro-computed 
tomography analyses revealed reduced GAG deposition in the phalanges joints and 
composition/morphology improvement of cranial and facial bones. Neurological 
assessment in the hAEC treated mice showed significant improvement of 
sensorimotor coordination in the hAEC treated mice compared to untreated mice. 
Results confirm that partial liver cell replacement with placental stem cells 
can provide long-term (>20 weeks) and systemic restoration of enzyme function, 
and lead to significant phenotypic improvement in the MPS1 mouse model. This 
preclinical data indicate that liver-directed placental stem cell 
transplantation may improve skeletal and neurological phenotypes of MPS1 
patients. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:1583-1594.

OBJECTIVE: Approximately 20-30% of all colorectal cancer (CRC) cases may have a 
familial contribution. The family history of CRC can be prominent (e.g., 
hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC)) or more moderate (e.g., familial colorectal 
cancer (FCRC)). For family members at risk, colonoscopic surveillance is a 
well-established method to prevent both HCRC and FCRC, although the evidence for 
the exact procedures of the surveillance is limited. Surveillance can come at a 
high price if individuals are frequently examined, as this may result in 
unnecessary colonoscopies in relation to actual risk for CRC. This study 
analyses the cost-effectiveness of a surveillance programme implemented in the 
Northern Sweden Health Care Region.
METHODS: The study includes 259 individuals prospectively recorded in the 
colonoscopic surveillance programme registry at the Cancer Prevention Clinic, 
Umeå University Hospital. We performed a cost-utility analysis with a 
contrafactual design: we compared observed costs and loss of quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) due to CRC with the surveillance programme to an expected 
outcome without surveillance. The main measure was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between surveillance and non-surveillance. 
Scenario analysis was used to explore uncertainty.
RESULTS: The ICER between surveillance and non-surveillance in the base model 
was 3596€/QALY. The ICER varied from -4620€ in the best-case scenario to 33,779€ 
in the worst-case scenario.
CONCLUSION: Colonoscopic surveillance is a very cost-effective method to prevent 
HCRC and FCRC compared to current thresholds for cost-effectiveness and other 
cancer preventive interventions.

Metabolic Syndrome.

Medicine, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA.

The United States is experiencing its greatest life expectancy ever. 
Nonetheless, the general health of the US population is far from at an all-time 
high. An important contributor to the pandemic of cardiovascular disease is that 
overweight and obesity are also the major determinants of metabolic syndrome, an 
all too common and all too serious clinical and public health challenge. 
Clinicians have traditionally evaluated each of the major risk factors 
contributing to metabolic syndrome on an individual basis. There is evidence, 
however, that the risk factors are more than additive. The overlap of these 
factors in each disease state, resulting in increased atherogenic risks, is 
worth examining as a broader entity rather than separately. While therapeutic 
lifestyle changes (TLCs) should be strongly recommended, clinicians should not 
let the perfect be the enemy of the possible. Evidence-based doses of statins, 
aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor 
blockers should be prescribed as adjuncts, not alternatives, to TLCs. In fact, 
there is cogent evidence that the benefits of these pharmacologic therapies may 
also be at least additive.

Current and future perspectives on the management of polypharmacy.

BACKGROUND: Because of ageing populations, the growth in the number of people 
with multi-morbidity and greater compliance with disease-specific guidelines, 
polypharmacy is becoming increasingly common. Although the correct drug 
treatment in patients with complex medical problems can improve clinical 
outcomes, quality of life and life expectancy, polypharmacy is also associated 
with an increased risk of adverse drug events, some severe enough to result in 
hospital admission and even death. Hence, having systems in place to ensure that 
medications are started only when there is a suitable indication, ensuring 
patients are fully aware of the benefits and complications that may arise from 
their treatment, and reviewing patients regularly to ensure their medication 
regime remains appropriate, are essential.
DISCUSSION: The development and rapid uptake of electronic patient records - 
particularly in primary care settings where the majority of prescribing takes 
place - makes monitoring of patients more straightforward than in the past; and 
allows identification of sub-groups of patients at particularly high risk of 
adverse drug events and complications. It also facilitates 'deprescribing' the 
process by which medications are reviewed and stopped if not clinically 
beneficial. In recent years, we have also seen the development of smartphone 
'apps' to improve communication between patients and healthcare professionals, 
improve people's understanding of their conditions and their treatment, and 
maintain a record of changes made to patient's medication. In the longer term, 
developments such as the introduction of artificial intelligence and clinical 
decision support systems also have the potential to improve prescribing and 
minimise the risks from polypharmacy. Finally, there is considerable scope to 
improve the quality of prescribing and reduce risks from poly-pharmacy using 
non-medical groups such as pharmacists, specialist nurses and physician 
assistants. Polypharmacy has increased in recent decades and will continue to 
increase as populations age and the number of people with multiple long-term 
conditions increases. As with all areas of medicine, the evidence-base in this 
area continues to evolve. Further trials on the impact on patients with 
polypharmacy of new interventions such as technology-based solutions and the use 
of different professional groups are needed to improve the evidence-base in this 
area.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have found associations between ambient fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) and increased mortality risk. However, little 
evidence is available on associations between PM2.5 and years of life lost 
(YLL). We aimed to estimate the YLL due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) mortality related to ambient PM2.5 exposure.
METHODS: A time-series study was conducted based on the data on air pollutants, 
meteorological conditions and 18,472 registered COPD deaths in Ningbo, China, 
2011-2015. The effects of PM2.5 on YLL and daily death of COPD were estimated, 
after controlling long term trend, meteorological index and other confounders.
RESULTS: The impact of PM2.5 on YLL due to COPD lasted for 5 days (lag 0-4). Per 
10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with 0.91 (95%CI: 0.16, 1.66) years 
increase in YLL. The excess YLL of COPD mortality were 8206 years, and 0.38 day 
per person in Ningbo from 2011 to 2015. The exposure-response curve of PM2.5 and 
YLL due to COPD showed a non-linear pattern, with relatively steep at low levels 
and flattened out at higher exposures.. Furthermore, the effects were 
significantly higher in the elderly than those in the younger.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings explored burden of PM2.5 on YLL due to COPD and 
highlight the importance and urgency of ambient PM2.5 pollution control and 
protection of the vulnerable populations.

Controlled release of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds from packaging 
films is of utmost importance for extending the shelf-life of perishable foods. 
This study focused on the mathematical modeling of gallic acid release into an 
aqueous medium from three chitosan films, formulated with grape seed extract 
(GSE) and carvacrol. We quantified the release by HPLC technique during 30days 
at three temperatures (5, 25 and 45°C). The diffusion coefficients, varying with 
temperature according to an Arrhenius-type relationship, and the respective 
activation energies for Film-1 and Film-2 were, respectively [Formula: see text] 
m2s-1 and [Formula: see text] m2s-1, Ea1=58kJmol-1 and Ea2=60kJmol-1 as obtained 
from the Fickian fit. The low concentrations of gallic acid released by Film-3 
could not be detected by HPLC, therefore the respective diffusion coefficient 
was not estimated. This study will help with the development and optimization of 
active packaging (AP) films aiming at improved food preservation and shelf-life 
extension.

We have developed and characterized a novel photoswitchable phospholipid analog 
termed N-nitroBIPS-DPPG. The fluorescence can be switched on and off repeatedly 
with minimal photobleaching by UV or visible light exposure, respectively. The 
rather large photochromic head group is inserted deeply into the interfacial 
membrane region conferring a conical overall lipid shape, preference for a 
positive curvature and only minimal intermembrane transfer. Utilizing the 
switchable NBD fluorescence quenching ability of N-nitroBIPS-DPPG, a detergent 
free intermembrane transfer assay system for NBD modified lipids was 
demonstrated and validated. As NBD quenching can be turned off, total NBD 
associated sample fluorescence can be determined without the need of detergents. 
This not only reduces detergent associated systematic errors, but also 
simplifies assay handling and allows assay extension to detergent insoluble 
lipid species.

BACKGROUND: A global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) is 
underway, yet two key programmatic features are currently still lacking: (1) the 
extension of efforts to all lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic countries, and (2) 
the expansion of geographic coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) within 
countries. For varying levels of scale-up of MDA, we assessed the health 
benefits and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with 
LF eradication, projected the potential savings due to decreased morbidity 
management needs, and estimated potential household productivity gains as a 
result of reduced LF-related morbidity.
METHODS: We extended an LF transmission model to track hydrocele and lymphoedema 
incidence in order to obtain estimates of the disability adjusted life years 
(DALYs) averted due to scaling up MDA over a period of 50 years. We then 
estimated the ICERs and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves associated 
with different rates of MDA scale-up. Health systems savings were estimated by 
considering the averted morbidity, treatment-seeking behaviour and morbidity 
management costs. Gains in worker productivity were estimated by multiplying 
estimated working days lost as a result of morbidity with country-specific 
per-worker agricultural wages.
RESULTS: Our projections indicate that a massive scaling-up of MDA could lead to 
4.38 million incremental DALYs averted over a 50-year time horizon compared to a 
scenario which mirrors current efforts against LF. In comparison to maintaining 
the current rate of progress against LF, massive scaling-up of MDA-pursuing LF
