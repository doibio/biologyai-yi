the training of healthcare professionals, (2) implementation context and 
outcomes, (3) patient outcomes, and (4) effects on interprofessional 
collaboration.
METHODS/DESIGN: A multiphase mixed-methods design will be used for the study. A 
total of 100 patients and 120 healthcare professionals in a specialized oncology 
hospital will be involved. The training outcomes will be documented using a 
questionnaire. Implementation context and outcomes will be explored through 
semi-structured interviews and written questionnaires with healthcare 
professionals and with the training participants and through a content analysis 
of patient files. Patient outcomes will be assessed in a pragmatic non-blinded 
randomized controlled trial and in qualitative interviews with patients and 
caregivers. Trial outcomes are supportive care needs (SCNS-SF34-G), quality of 
life (SeiQol and Fact-L), depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-4), and distress 
(Distress Thermometer). Qualitative semi-structured interviews on patients' 
views will focus on shared decision-making, communication needs, feeling 
empathy, and further utilization of healthcare services. Interprofessional 
collaboration will be explored using the UWE-IP-D before the implementation of 
MCA (t0) and after 3 (t1), 9 (t2), and 12 (t3) months.
DISCUSSION: Using guideline-concordant early palliative care, MCA aims to foster 
patient-centered communication with shared decision-making and facilitation of 
advance care planning including end-of-life decisions, thus increasing patient 
quality of life and decreasing aggressive medical care at the end of life. It is 
assumed that the communication skills training and interprofessional coaching 
will improve the communication behavior of healthcare providers and influence 
team communications and team processes.

BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination has been clinically shown to reduce adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, but the 
economic perspectives can provide important data to make informed decisions. 
This study aimed to perform the economic evaluation of lifelong annual influenza 
vaccination for cardiovascular events and well-established pneumonia prevention.
METHODS: Lifetime costs, life-expectancy, and quality-adjusted live years 
(QALYs) were estimated beyond one-year cycle length of a six-health states 
Markov model condition on whether a hospitalization for ACS, stroke, heart 
failure, pneumonia, no hospitalizations occurred, or death. The comparison of 
three age-groups of 40-49, 50-65, and > 65 years scenario was performed. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NMB) were 
presented as a societal perspective in 2016. The model robustness was determined 
by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The influenza vaccination was cost-effective in all age-groups, by 
dominant ICERs (lower cost with higher effectiveness) which was completely lower 
than acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold of Thailand [160,000 THB (4,466.8 
USD) per QALYs], with a great incremental value of NMB. Especially, the 
50-year-old-and-above scenario was shown as the most benefit at 129,092 THB 
(3,603.9 USD) for each patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The annually additional influenza vaccination to standard treatment 
in ACS was cost-effective in all age-groups, which should be considered in 
clinical practice and health-policy making process.

AIMS: A discussion of how quality-adjusted life years are used to inform 
resource allocation decisions and highlight how assumptions underpinning the 
measurement of quality of life are contrary to the principles of patient-centred 
care.
BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) can provide influential guidance 
for health resource allocation, particularly in the context of a 
budget-constrained public health insurance plan. Most national economic 
guideline bodies recommend that quality-adjusted life year weights for CEA be 
elicited indirectly (public preferences). This has potentially important 
implications for healthcare provision and research, as it discounts the ability 
of a person experiencing an illness to describe how it affects their quality of 
life.
DESIGN: Discussion paper.
DATA SOURCES: Guidelines for the conduct of health economic evaluations, 
influential methodological and theoretical texts, and a review of PubMed 
conducted in April 2017.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses are increasingly interested in leveraging 
methods from health economics to aid in decision-making and advocacy. In this 
analysis, we highlight how taken-for-granted approaches to the measurement of 
quality of life may discount the experience of patients and lead to decisions 
that are contrary to the principles of patient-centred care. Nurses conducting 
or reading research using these methods should consider whether the approach 
used to measure the quality of life are appropriate for the population under 
consideration.
CONCLUSION: Since patient and public health preferences can differ in both 
magnitude and direction, guideline bodies should re-evaluate their partiality 
for public preferences in the reference case.

BACKGROUND: The risk of developing long-term complications of type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) is related to glycaemic control and is reduced by the use of intensive 
insulin treatment regimens: multiple daily injections (MDI) (≥ 4) and continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Despite a lack of evidence that the more 
expensive treatment with CSII is superior to MDI, both treatments are used 
widely within the NHS.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To compare glycaemic control during treatment with CSII and MDI 
and (2) to determine safety and cost-effectiveness of the treatment, and quality 
of life (QoL) of the patients.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, open-label randomised controlled trial with an internal 
pilot and 12-month follow-up with 1 : 1 web-based block randomisation stratified 
by age and centre.
SETTING: Fifteen diabetes clinics in hospitals in England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 7 months to 15 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Continuous subsutaneous insulin infusion or MDI initiated within 
14 days of diagnosis of T1D.
DATA SOURCES: Data were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months using 
paper forms and were entered centrally. Data from glucometers and CSII were 
downloaded. The Health Utilities Index Mark 2 was completed at each visit and 
the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL, diabetes module) was completed 
at 6 and 12 months. Costs were estimated from hospital patient administration 
system data.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration 
at 12 months. The secondary outcomes were (1) HbA1c concentrations of 
< 48 mmol/mol, (2) severe hypoglycaemia, (3) diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), (4) 
T1D- or treatment-related adverse events (AEs), (5) change in body mass index 
and height standard deviation score, (6) insulin requirements, (7) QoL and (8) 
partial remission rate. The economic outcome was the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: A total of 293 participants, with a median age of 9.8 years (minimum 
0.7 years, maximum 16 years), were randomised (CSII, n = 149; MDI, n = 144) 
between May 2011 and January 2015. Primary outcome data were available for 97% 
of participants (CSII, n = 143; MDI, n = 142). At 12 months, age-adjusted least 
mean squares HbA1c concentrations were comparable between groups: CSII, 
60.9 mmol/mol [95% confidence interval (CI) 58.5 to 63.3 mmol/mol]; MDI, 
58.5 mmol/mol (95% CI 56.1 to 60.9 mmol/mol); and the difference of CSII - MDI, 
2.4 mmol/mol (95% CI -0.4 to 5.3 mmol/mol). For HbA1c concentrations of 
< 48 mmol/mol (CSII, 22/143 participants; MDI, 29/142 participants), the 
relative risk was 0.75 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.25), and for partial remission rates 
(CSII, 21/86 participants; MDI, 21/64), the relative risk was 0.74 (95% CI 0.45 
to 1.24). The incidences of severe hypoglycaemia (CSII, 6/144; MDI, 2/149 
participants) and DKA (CSII, 2/144 participants; MDI, 0/149 participants) were 
low. In total, 68 AEs (14 serious) were reported during CSII treatment and 25 
AEs (eight serious) were reported during MDI treatment. Growth outcomes did not 
differ. The reported insulin use was higher with CSII (mean difference 
0.1 unit/kg/day, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.2 unit/kg/day; p = 0.01). QoL was slightly 
higher for those randomised to CSII. From a NHS perspective, CSII was more 
expensive than MDI mean total cost (£1863, 95% CI £1620 to £2137) with no 
additional QALY gains (-0.006 QALYs, 95% CI -0.031 to 0.018 QALYs).
LIMITATIONS: Generalisability beyond 12 months is uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: No clinical benefit of CSII over MDI was identified. CSII is not a 
cost-effective treatment in patients representative of the study population.
FUTURE WORK: Longer-term follow-up is required to determine if clinical outcomes 
diverge after 1 year. A qualitative exploration of patient and professional 
experiences of MDI and CSII should be considered.

The current study aimed to examine the reliability of the conventional and 
functional ratios derived from peak torques (PTs) and those obtained from the 
combination of knee flexors torque at the angle of knee extensors PT. Twenty-six 
male athletes (mean of 24.0±0.7 years) from different sports completed a 
test-to-test variation in isokinetic strength (Biodex, System 3) within a period 
of one week. Anthropometry and body composition assessed by Dual Energy X-ray 
Absorptiometry were also measured. The proposed isokinetic strength ratio 
measurements appeared to be highly reliable: conventional ratio at PT angle 
(intra-class correlation, ICC = 0.98; 95% confidence interval; 95%CI: 0.95 to 
0.99); functional extension ratio at PT angle (ICC = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.96 to 0.99); 
and, functional flexion ratio at PT angle (ICC = 0.95; 95%CI: 0.89 to 0.98). 
Technical error of measurement (TEM) and associated percentage of the 
coefficient of variation (%CV) were as follows: conventional ratio at PT angle 
(TEM = 0.02; %CV = 4.1); functional extension ratio at PT angle (TEM = 0.02; %CV 
= 3.8); and, functional flexion ratio at PT angle (TEM = 0.03; %CV = 3.6). The 
current study demonstrated that the traditional and new obtained simple and 
combined isokinetic indicators seem highly reliable to assess muscle strength 
and function in adult male athletes. A single testing session seems to be 
sufficiently to obtain these isokinetic strength indicators.

The average life expectancy for humans has increased over the last years. 
However, the quality of the later stages of life is low and is considered a 
public health issue of global importance. Late adulthood and the transition into 
the later stage of life occasionally leads to neurodegenerative diseases that 
selectively affect different types of neurons and brain regions, producing motor 
dysfunctions, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disorders that are 
progressive, irreversible, without remission periods, and incurable. 
Huntington's disease (HD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. In the 25 
years since the mutation of the huntingtin (HTT) gene was identified as the 
molecule responsible for this neural disorder, a variety of animal models, 
including the fruit fly, have been used to study the disease. Here, we review 
recent research that used Drosophila as an experimental tool for improving 
knowledge about the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning HD.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental illness have markedly reduced life 
expectancy; cardiometabolic disease is a major cause. Psychiatric hospital 
inpatients have elevated levels of cardiometabolic risk factors and are to a 
high degree dependent of the routines and facilities of the institutions. 
Studies of lifestyle interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in psychiatric 
inpatients are few. The current study aimed at assessing the feasibility and 
effects of a lifestyle intervention including Motivational Interviewing (MI) on 
physical activity levels, cardiometabolic risk status and mental health status 
in psychotic disorder inpatients.
METHODS: Prospective naturalistic intervention study of 83 patients at long term 
inpatient psychosis treatment wards in South-Eastern Norway. Patients were 
assessed 3-6 months prior to, at start and 6 months after a life-style 
intervention program including training of staff in MI, simple changes in 
routines and improvements of facilities for physical exercise. Assessments were 
done by clinical staff and included level of physical activity, motivation, life 
satisfaction, symptom levels (MADRS, AES-C, PANSS, and GAF) as well as 
anthropometric and biochemical markers of cardiometabolic risk. A mixed model 
was applied to analyze change over time.
RESULTS: A total of 88% of patients received MI interventions, with a mean of 
2.5 MI interventions per week per patient. The physical activity level was not 
increased, but activity level was positively associated with motivation and 
negatively associated with positive symptoms. Triglyceride levels and number of 
smokers were significantly reduced and a significant decrease in symptom levels 
was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that a simple, low cost life-style 
intervention program focusing on motivational change is feasible and may reduce 
symptoms and improve lifestyle habits in psychosis patients in long term 
treatment facilities. Similar programs may easily be implemented in other 
psychiatric hospitals.

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are 
widely accepted techniques to eliminate small unresectable colorectal liver 
metastases (CRLM). Although previous studies labelled thermal ablation inferior 
to surgical resection, the apparent selection bias when comparing patients with 
unresectable disease to surgical candidates, the superior safety profile, and 
the competitive overall survival results for the more recent reports mandate the 
setup of a randomized controlled trial. The objective of the COLLISION trial is 
to prove non-inferiority of thermal ablation compared to hepatic resection in 
patients with at least one resectable and ablatable CRLM and no extrahepatic 
disease.
METHODS: In this two-arm, single-blind multi-center phase-III clinical trial, 
six hundred and eighteen patients with at least one CRLM (≤3 cm) will be 
included to undergo either surgical resection or thermal ablation of appointed 
target lesion(s) (≤3 cm). Primary endpoint is OS (overall survival, 
intention-to-treat analysis). Main secondary endpoints are overall disease-free 
survival (DFS), time to progression (TTP), time to local progression (TTLP), 
primary and assisted technique efficacy (PTE, ATE), procedural morbidity and 
mortality, length of hospital stay, assessment of pain and quality of life 
(QoL), cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
DISCUSSION: If thermal ablation proves to be non-inferior in treating lesions 
≤3 cm, a switch in treatment-method may lead to a reduction of the 
post-procedural morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay and incremental 
costs without compromising oncological outcome for patients with CRLM.

BACKGROUND: Sierra Leone is pursuing multiple initiatives to establish 
in-country postgraduate medical education (PGME), as part of national efforts to 
strengthen the health workforce. This paper explored the career preferences of 
junior doctors in Sierra Leone; and the potential benefits and challenges with 
regards to the development of PGME locally.
METHODS: Junior doctors (n = 15) who had graduated from the only medical school 
in Sierra Leone were purposively sampled based on maximum variation (e.g. 
men/women, years of graduation). In-depth interviews were conducted in October 
2013, and digital diaries and two follow-up interviews were used to explore 
their evolving career aspirations until November 2016. Additionally, 16 
semi-structured interviews with key informants were held to gather perspectives 
on the development of PGME locally. Results were thematically analysed.
RESULTS: All junior doctors interviewed intended to pursue PGME with the 
majority wanting primarily a clinical career. Half were interested in also 
gaining a public health qualification. Major factors influencing career 
preferences included: prior exposure, practical (anticipated job content), 
personal considerations (individual interests), financial provision, and 
contextual (aspirations to help address certain health needs). Majority of 
doctors considered West Africa but East and South Africa were also location 
options for clinical PGME. Several preferred to leave the African continent to 
pursue PGME. Factors influencing decision-making on location were: financial 
(scholarships), practical (availability of preferred specialty), reputation 
(positive and negative), and social (children). Key informants viewed the 
potential benefits of expanding PGME in Sierra Leone as: cost-effectiveness 
(compared to overseas specialist training), maintaining service delivery during 
training years, decreasing loss of doctors (some decide not to return after 
gaining their specialist degree abroad), and enhancing quality control and 
academic culture of the local medical school. Major perceived challenges were 
capacity constraints, especially the dearth of specialists required to achieve 
training programme accreditation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided an insight into the career preferences of 
junior doctors in Sierra Leone. It is timely as there is increasing political 
and professional momentum to expand PGME locally. Findings may guide those 
involved in this PGME expansion in terms of how possibly to influence junior 
doctors in their career decision-making.

Total knee arthroplasty is a well established treatment for degenerative joint 
disease, which is also performed as a treatment in younger and middle-aged 
patients who have a significant physical activity and high life expectancy. 
However, complications may occur due to biological responses to wear particles, 
as well as local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions triggered by metal ions 
and particles such as cobalt, chromium and molybdenum. The purpose of the study 
was to perform a highly demanding activities (HDA) knee wear simulation in order 
to compare the wear characteristics and metal ion release barrier function of a 
zirconium nitride (ZrN) coated knee implant, designed for patients with 
suspected metal ion hypersensitivity, against an uncoated knee implant made out 
of CoCrMo. The load profiles were applied for 5 million HDA cycles, which 
represent 15-30 years of in vivo service depending on the activity level of the 
patient. Results showed a significant wear rate reduction for the coated group 
(1.01 ± 0.29 mg/million cycles) in comparison with the uncoated group 
(2.89 ± 1.04 mg/million cycles). The zirconium nitride coating showed no sign of 
scratches nor delamination during the wear simulation, whereas the uncoated 
femurs showed characteristic wear scratches in the articulation areas. 
Furthermore, the metal ion release from the coated implants was reduced up to 
three orders of magnitude in comparison with the uncoated implants. These 
results demonstrate the efficiency of zirconium nitride coated knee implants to 
reduce wear as well as to substantially reduce metal ion release in the knee 
joint.

BACKGROUND: Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma is the second most common cause 
of cancer deaths. It remains challenging to intensify cancer treatment without 
impairing liver function.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the TheraSphere in the Treatment of Patients with 
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (STOP-HCC) study is to examine the 
hypothesis that transarterial radioembolization (TheraSphere yttrium-90 glass 
microspheres) combined with standard first-line treatment with sorafenib will 
improve outcomes over treatment with sorafenib alone in unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma. The STOP-HCC study is the largest international, 
multicenter, prospective study of intra-arterial treatment in combination with 
sorafenib in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we report the study 
design.
METHODS: STOP-HCC is a prospective, phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled 
study conducted across up to 105 sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. 
Eligible adults have unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and a life expectancy 
of at least 12 weeks, 1 or more unidimensional measurable lesions, Child-Pugh 
score 7 points or less, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance 
Status score 1 or lower, and are candidates for treatment with sorafenib. 
Presence of branch portal vein tumor thrombosis is permitted. Patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sorafenib alone or 
transarterial radioembolization followed by sorafenib within 2 to 6 weeks. The 
primary outcome is overall survival. Secondary outcomes are time to progression, 
time to untreatable progression, time to symptomatic progression, tumor 
response, quality of life, and adverse event occurrence. The study is an 
adaptive trial, comprising a group-sequential design with 2 interim analyses 
with 520 patients, and an option to increase the sample size to 700 patients at 
the second interim analysis. The sample size of 520 patients allows for 417 
deaths to give 80% power to detect an increase in median overall survival from 
10.7 months for the sorafenib group (based on the Sorafenib Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Protocol [SHARP] trial) to 14.2 months for the 
transarterial radioembolization+sorafenib group (hazard ratio 0.754) with 
2-sided alpha of .05. The increased sample size of 700 patients allows for 564 
deaths to give 80% power to detect a smaller difference in median overall 
survival from 10.7 months for the sorafenib group to 13.7 months for the 
transarterial radioembolization+sorafenib group (hazard ratio 0.781).
RESULTS: Enrollment for the study completed in September 2017. Results of the 
first and second interim analyses were reviewed by the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee. The recommendation of the committee, at both interim 
analyses, was to continue the study without any changes.
CONCLUSIONS: The STOP-HCC study will contribute toward the establishment of the 
role of combination therapy with transarterial radioembolization and sorafenib 
in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with and without 
branch portal vein tumor thrombosis.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether declines in life expectancy occurred across high 
income countries during 2014-16, to identify the causes of death contributing to 
these declines, and to examine the extent to which these declines were driven by 
shared or differing factors across countries.
DESIGN: Demographic analysis using aggregated data.
SETTING: Vital statistics systems of 18 member countries of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development.
PARTICIPANTS: 18 countries with high quality all cause and cause specific 
mortality data available in 2014-16.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth, 0-65 years, and 65 or more 
years and cause of death contributions to changes in life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: The majority of high income countries in the study experienced declines 
in life expectancy during 2014-15; of the 18 countries, 12 experienced declines 
in life expectancy among women and 11 experienced declines in life expectancy 
among men. The average decline was 0.21 years for women and 0.18 years for men. 
In most countries experiencing declines in life expectancy, these declines were 
predominantly driven by trends in older age (≥65 years) mortality and in deaths 
related to respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, nervous system disease, 
and mental disorders. In the United States, declines in life expectancy were 
more concentrated at younger ages (0-65 years), and drug overdose and other 
external causes of death played important roles in driving these declines.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the countries that experienced declines in life expectancy 
during 2014-15 experienced robust gains in life expectancy during 2015-16 that 
more than compensated for the declines. However, the United Kingdom and the 
United States appear to be experiencing stagnating or continued declines in life 
expectancy, raising questions about future trends in these countries.

Objectives: Airports in the U.S. have gradually been transitioning to automated 
flight systems. These systems generate new flight paths over populated areas. 
While they can improve flight efficiency, the increased noise associated with 
these novel flight patterns potentially pose serious health threats to the 
overflown communities. In this case study, we estimated the monetary benefits 
relative to health losses associated with one significant change in flight 
patterns at LaGuardia Airport, year-round use of "TNNIS Climb", which happened 
in 2012 as a result of flight automation in New York City. Prior to that, the 
use of the TNNIS Climb was limited to the U.S. Open tennis matches. Methods: We 
developed a decision-analytic model using Markov health states to compare the 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained associated with the limited 
use of TNNIS (old status quo) and the year-round use of TNNIS (current status 
quo). The TNNIS Climb increases airplane noise to above 60 decibels (dB) over 
some of the most densely populated areas of the city. We used this increased 
exposure to noise as the basis for estimating ground-level health using data 
from sound monitors. The total costs (including both direct and indirect costs), 
QALYs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated for 
the limited versus the year-round use of the TNNIS Climb. Results: The 
incremental lifetime costs and QALYs per person exposed to noise associated with 
the limited versus the year-round use of TNNIS was $11,288, and 1.13, 
respectively. Therefore, the limited use of TNNIS had an ICER of $10,006/QALY 
gained relative to the year-round of TNNIS. Our analyses were robust to changes 
in assumptions and data inputs. Conclusions: Despite increases in efficiency, 
flight automation systems without a careful assessment of noise might generate 
flight paths over densely populated areas and cause serious health conditions 
for the overflown communities.

Although biopsy is one of the most important methods for diagnosis in diseases, 
there is ambiguity based on the information obtained from the visual inspection 
of tissue slices. Here, we studied the effect of external extension on tissue 
slices from mouse liver with different stages of disease: Healthy normal state, 
Simple steatosis, Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and Hepatocellular carcinoma. We 
found that the cracking pattern of a tissue slice caused by extension can 
provide useful information for distinguishing among the disease states. 
Interestingly, slices with Hepatocellular carcinoma showed a fine roughening on 
the cracking pattern with a characteristic length of the size of cells, which is 
much different than the cracking pattern for slices with non-cancerous 
steatosis, for which the cracks were relatively straight. The significant 
difference in the cracking pattern depending on the disease state is 
attributable to a difference in the strength of cell-cell adhesion, which would 
be very weak under carcinosis. As it is well known that the manner of cell-cell 
adhesion neatly concerns with the symptoms in many diseases, it may be promising 
to apply the proposed methodology to the diagnosis of other diseases.

The Connectivity Map (CMap) is a tool that has been extensively utilized to 
study drug repositioning and side-effect prediction. However, most of these 
analyses rely on signature genes, ignoring the pathways by which those genes are 
regulated, as well as the functional overlap of redundant genes. The present 
study utilized a systems biology approach referred to as Weighted Gene 
Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to dissect the transcriptional profiles 
of CMap and reveal these hidden factors. Seven common modules associated with 
protein binding, extracellular matrix organization and translation were 
identified. Furthermore, drugs were clustered based on module expression to 
infer their mechanism of action (MoA) based on common activity profiles. As an 
extension of this, an example of disease-based module projection to identify 
novel drugs was provided. The analysis developed in the present study may 
provide a novel framework for drug repositioning or discovering MoAs.
