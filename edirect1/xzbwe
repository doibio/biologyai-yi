factors which drive cost-effectiveness for all 28 EU countries (mean per capita 
alcohol consumption, proportion of the population to be screened over a 10-year 
SBI programme; per capita alcohol-attributable mortality; per capita 
alcohol-attributable morbidity; mean cost of an alcohol-related hospitalisation 
and mean SBI-delivery staff cost). Regression analysis was used to fit two 
meta-models estimating net programme costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs) gained, to calculate cost-effectiveness estimates specific to each EU 
country.
RESULTS: Costs are dependent upon the proportion of the population covered by 
the screening programme, the country-specific per capita mortality and morbidity 
rate and the country-specific costs of GP care and hospitalisation. QALYs depend 
on the proportion of the population screened and per capita alcohol consumption. 
Despite large inter-country variability in factor values, SBI programmes are 
likely to be cost-effective in 24 out of 28 EU countries and cost-saving in 50% 
of countries.
CONCLUSION: Implementing national programmes of SBI in primary health care would 
be a cost-effective means of reducing alcohol-attributable morbidity and deaths 
in almost all countries of the EU.

For the majority of patients with end-stage kidney failure (ESKF) replacement of 
excretory renal function by dialysis or transplantation (RRT) can extend life 
and alleviate symptoms. Historically, the availability of RRT has been 
insufficient and this remains the case for much of the world. However, RRT is 
now widely available in healthcare systems of higher income countries. 
Increasing numbers of elderly patients are developing ESKF. RRT in this 
population is largely by dialysis, comorbidity is high and life expectancy 
short. Evidence of effectiveness coupled with the burden of treatment among 
these individuals has raised concerns that health services in high-income 
countries may have moved from an era of unmet need into one of potential 
over-treatment. Alongside the requirement to make treatment more 
patient-centered, this has driven the development of comprehensive conservative 
care as an alternative approach for older comorbid individuals with ESKF, with 
the potential for acceptable symptom control and reduced treatment burden. This 
paper provides a largely UK-perspective on treating ESKF without RRT. Emphasis 
is on the need for high-quality evidence to inform treatment decisions. 
Complexities of defining, delivering and improving treatment of ESKF without 
dialysis care are explored. Quantitative and qualitative evidence are summarized 
and the relationship with palliative and terminal care examined. A framework is 
suggested for classifying management of ESKF and recommendations made to improve 
delivery of nondialysis care in the future. For patients with a poor prognosis, 
such treatment may not result in significantly different survival or quality of 
life when compared with dialysis. There is a key need to generate the best 
possible evidence of person-centered health outcomes associated with the various 
treatment options for ESKF and to present this to patients in a balanced, 
personalized way that allows them to make the treatment decision most 
appropriate for them.

BACKGROUND: The rising cost of healthcare is well documented. The purpose of 
this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of pelvic exenteration (PE).
METHODS: Consecutive patients referred for consideration of PE between 2008 and 
2011 were recruited into a prospective non-randomized study that compared 
quality of life (QoL) between patients who did or did not undergo PE. 
Information on QoL and cost (in Australian dollars, AUD) was collected at 
baseline, during admission and up to 24 months after discharge. QoL data were 
converted into a utility-based measure. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
calculated. Bottom-up costing was performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was calculated per life-year saved and per QALY.
RESULTS: There were 174 patients with sufficient data for analysis. Of these, 
139 underwent PE. R0 was achieved in 78·4 per cent of patients. The survival 
rate at 24 months after PE was 74·8 per cent compared with 43 per cent in those 
without exenteration (P = 0·001). Treatment costs were significantly higher for 
patients who had PE compared with those who did not (mean AUD 137 407 versus 
79 174; P < 0·001). The ICER was AUD 124 147 (95 per cent c.i. 71 585 to 
261 876) per life-year saved and AUD 227 330 (109 974 to 1 100 449) per QALY. 
Curative PE (R0) was found to be more cost-effective than non-curative PE 
(R1/R2), with an ICER of AUD 101 518 (60 105 to 200 428) versus 390 712 (74 368 
to 82 256 739) per life-year saved.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of advanced pelvic cancers is expensive regardless of the 
treatment intent. For a cost difference of only AUD 58 000 (€38 264), PE offers 
a chance of cure, and improves survival and QoL.

The Load Model: an alternative to QALY.

Benson T(1)(2).

Author information:

(2)b University College London, Institute of Health Informatics , London , UK.

BACKGROUND: QALYs are widely used in health economic evaluation, but remain 
controversial, largely because they do not reflect how many people behave in 
practice. This paper presents a new conceptual model (Load Model) and 
illustrates it in comparison with the QALY model.
METHODS: Load is the average annual weight attributed to morbidity and mortality 
over a defined period, using weightings based on preference judgements. 
Morbidity Load is attributed to states of illness, according to their perceived 
severity. When people are in full health, Load is zero (no morbidity). Death is 
treated as an event with negative consequences, incurred in the year following 
death. Deaths may be weighted equally, with a fixed negative weight such as 
-100, or differ according to the context of death. After death, Load is zero. In 
a worked example, we use the standard gamble method to obtain a weighting for an 
illness state, for both Load and QALY models. A judge is indifferent between 
certainty of 1.5 years' illness followed by death, or a 50/50 chance of 1.5 
years' full health or 1-year illness, each followed by death. The weightings 
calculated are applied to a hypothetical life, 72 years in full health followed 
by 3 years with illness then death, using both models. Three other hypothetical 
outcomes are also compared.
RESULTS: For an example life, the relative size of the morbidity component 
compared with the mortality component is much higher in the Load model than in 
the QALY model. When comparing alternative outcomes, there are also substantial 
differences between the two models.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Load model the weight of morbidity, relative to mortality, 
is very different from that in the QALY model. Given the role of the QALYs in 
economic evaluation, the implications of an alternative, which generates very 
different results, warrant further exploration.

Benefits and harms of long-term anticoagulant therapy (AT) after acute pulmonary 
embolism (PE) are poorly known. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
outcome of patients with PE treated with AT for 5 years according to American 
College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines.Patients with both unprovoked and 
secondary PE were consecutively enrolled in a "real life" study. After a 
12-month AT, they continued or stopped the treatment according to ACCP 
guidelines, and were followed-up for 5 years. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, 
recurrence, and fatal recurrence under AT.Of the original consecutive 585 
patients, 471 were included (83 dead, 31 lost during the 1st year). Of these, 
361 (76.6%) continued AT. During 5 years, death occurred in 109 (30.2%) 
patients, with a mortality rate of 8.00 events/100 person-years of follow-up; 
recurrence in 34 (9.4%), with an incidence rate of 2.58 events/person-years; 
fatal recurrence in 13 (3.6%), with an incidence rate of 
0.95 events/person-years. The case fatality rate for recurrence was 38.2%. In 
the subgroup of patients with unprovoked PE, the chance of dying was 
significantly lower (RR 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.53) and the 
tendency to fatal recurrence (not significantly) greater (0.11 events/100 
person-years vs 0.07 events/100 person-years) than in the remaining patients. 
Major bleeding occurred in 5 (1.3%) patients. The case fatality rate for 
bleeding was 14.3%.During 5-year AT, 30% of patients dies, 10% experiences 
recurrences, and 5% has fatal recurrences. According to guidelines, most 
patients need to continue AT; the case fatality rate for bleeding is lower than 
that for recurrence.

INTRODUCTION: Reducing racial health disparities is often stated as a population 
health goal, but specific targets for such improvement are seldom set. It is 
often assumed that improving overall health outcomes will be linked to disparity 
reduction, but this is not necessarily the case.
METHODS: We compared the annual change from 1999 through 2013 in combined-race 
(black and white) mortality with the annual change in absolute and relative 
racial mortality disparities for US states.
RESULTS: Median annual improvement in combined-race mortality was 1.08% per 
year. Annual overall mortality rate reductions ranged from 0.24% per year in 
Oklahoma to 1.83% per year in Maryland. For disparities, the median for the 
black-white absolute gap was 3.60% per year, and the median for the relative 
black-to-white ratio was 1.19% per year. There was no significant correlation 
between the combined-race measure and either the absolute (0.03) or relative 
disparity measure reductions (-0.17).
CONCLUSION: For mortality in US states over a recent period, improvement in the 
population mean and disparity reduction do not usually occur together. The 
disparity reduction rates observed may provide realistic guidance for public and 
private policy makers in setting goals for reducing population health disparity 
and creating investment priorities. As a starting point for discussion, the 
observed national median annual percentage improvement of 1.1 per year combined, 
3.6% per year absolute gap reduction, and 1.2% per year relative gap reduction 
would be modest and reasonable goals.

Allergy is a multisystem disease in children that often occurs with the 
coexistence of diverse clinical manifestations that cause great impact on 
quality of life and academic performance due to sleep disorders arising from the 
disease or treatment, and absenteeism that children may experience. Because of 
the time spent in school, there is a possibility that allergic reactions may 
occur first in these facilities, where a lack of staff knowledge has been found 
regarding how to proceed in allergy crisis situations. Cooperative action among 
health teams, community, parents, and school authorities is essential to ensure 
that the school can prevent, recognize, and ensure quick access to emergency 
services (if needed) and treatment protocols for allergic reactions, thus 
allowing allergic children to be better protected in the school environment, 
which should be considered an extension of the home environment and an important 
arm in proper management to control the disease.

Publisher: La alergia es una enfermedad multisistémica que en los niños se 
presenta a menudo con la coexistencia de diversas manifestaciones clínicas que 
causan gran impacto en la calidad de vida y en el desempeño académico, debido a 
los trastornos del sueño derivados de la misma enfermedad o del tratamiento, así 
como al absentismo al que pueden verse obligados los niños. Debido al tiempo que 
estos pasan en las escuelas existe la posibilidad de que las reacciones 
alérgicas ocurran por primera vez en esas instalaciones, donde se ha comprobado 
la falta de conocimientos del personal sobre cómo proceder en situaciones de 
emergencia por crisis de alergias. La acción cooperativa entre los equipos de 
salud, la comunidad, los padres y las autoridades escolares es esencial para 
asegurar que en la escuela se pueda prevenir, reconocer y garantizar un acceso 
rápido a los servicios de emergencia (en caso sea necesario) y protocolos de 
tratamiento de las reacciones alérgicas, permitiendo así que los niños alérgicos 
estén más protegidos dentro del ambiente escolar, que principalmente en ellos 
debe ser considerado como una extensión del entorno del hogar y un brazo 
importante en la correcta gestión para obtener el control de la enfermedad.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling disease, which 
leads to joint destruction and functional limitations. It diminishes 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and life expectancy. Frailty is a chronic 
inflammatory process related to aging that causes disability and affects HRQoL. 
The presence of comorbidity and polypharmacy are both related to RA severity. 
The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of frailty and comorbidities 
in patients with RA.
METHODS: Based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, we 
studied patients with RA that were seen at the outpatient clinic of the 
Rheumatology Department of a third level hospital. We applied the frailty 
criteria according to the Cardiovascular Health Study. We registered demographic 
data along with comorbidities and polypharmacy, using a cross-sectional, 
observational, and descriptive study design.
RESULTS: Five hundred consecutive RA patients were included, 453 (90.6 %) were 
female.Mean age was 51.3 years and mean disease duration was 13.2 years; 23.4 % 
met frailty criteria. Mean number of comorbidities was 1.59, with systemic 
hypertension and obesity as the most frequent ones (25.2 % and 18.2 %, 
respectively). Polypharmacy was found in 99.6 % and 69.6 % received more than 
five drugs simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty in this study was unexpectedly high and so 
were comorbidities and multiple drug usage. Clinicians should make an early 
detection of signs of frailty and comorbidity in RA patients.

Publisher: Introducción: la artritis reumatoide (AR) es una enfermedad 
inflamatoria crónica que causa daño articular progresivo, y afecta la calidad y 
la esperanza de vida. El síndrome de fragilidad (SF) es un precursor de 
limitaciones y discapacidad. La comorbilidad es un indicador de gravedad. Se 
buscó evaluar la frecuencia de fragilidad y comorbilidad en pacientes con AR. 
Métodos: se evaluaron pacientes consecutivos con AR atendidos en el departamento 
de Reumatología de un hospital de tercer nivel en los que fue posible aplicar 
los criterios para definir fragilidad según el Estudio de Salud Cardiovascular. 
Se registraron datos demográficos, el número de comorbilidades y la presencia de 
polifarmacia con un diseño observacional, descriptivo y transversal. Resultados: 
se analizaron 500 pacientes con AR. Fueron 453 mujeres (90.6 %). La edad 
promedio fue de 51.3 años y el tiempo promedio de evolución de la AR de 13.2 
años. El 23.4 % cumplió con criterios para SF. El promedio de comorbilidades fue 
de 1.59 y las más frecuentes fueron la hipertensión arterial sistémica (25.2 %) 
y la obesidad (18.2 %). Los pacientes tomaban en promedio 5.81 fármacos; el 99.6 
% incurría en polifarmacia y el 69.6 %, en polifarmacia mayor. Conclusiones: 
hubo una prevalencia muy alta de SF, mayor que la esperada en población general; 
asimismo, el número de comorbilidades y la presencia de polifarmacia fueron muy 
frecuentes. Se debe vigilar la aparición de datos clínicos de SF y comorbilidad 
en AR aun en sujetos jóvenes con enfermedad de corta evolución.

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) comprise a heterogeneous family of rare, genetic 
lysosomal storage disorders that result in severe morbidity and reduced life 
expectancy. Emerging treatments for several of these disorders have triggered 
the search for clinically relevant biomarkers and clinical markers associated 
with treatment efficacy in populations and individuals. However, biomedical 
measures do not tell the whole story when characterizing a complex chronic 
disorder such as MPS. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) tools that utilize 
patient reported outcomes to address patient parameters such as symptoms (pain, 
fatigue, psychological health), functioning (activity and limitations), or 
quality of life, have been used to supplement traditional biomedical endpoints. 
Many of these HRQoL tools have demonstrated that quality of life is negatively 
impacted in patients with MPS. There is both the opportunity and need to 
formally standardize and validate HRQoL tools for the different MPS disorders.

memory in mice.

Inflammasomes are the protein assemblies that consist of inflammasome sensors, 
adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like proteins containing a CARD (ASC) and 
inflammasome caspase. Inflammasomes sense multiple danger signals via various 
inflammasome sensors and consequently use caspase to trigger proteolytic 
processing and secretion of IL-1β cytokines. Recent studies have suggested that 
neurons use their own innate immune system to detect danger signals and regulate 
neuronal morphology. Here, we investigate whether inflammasomes, the critical 
components of innate immunity, participate in regulation of neuronal morphology 
and function. Among various sensors, Absent in melanoma 2 (Aim2) expression in 
neurons is most prominent. Adding synthetic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to 
cultured neurons induces IL-1β secretion in an AIM2-dependent manner and 
consequently downregulates dendritic growth but enhances axon extension. The 
results of Aim2 knockout and knockdown show that AIM2 acts cell-autonomously to 
regulate neuronal morphology. Behavioral analyses further reveal that Aim2-/- 
mice exhibit lower locomotor activity, increased anxious behaviors and reduced 
auditory fear memory. In conclusion, our study suggests that AIM2 inflammasomes 
regulate neuronal morphology and influence mouse behaviors.

The place of aspirin in primary prevention remains controversial, with North 
American and European organizations issuing contradictory treatment guidelines. 
More recently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended "initiating 
low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 
10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy 
of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at 
least 10 years." This recommendation reflects increasing evidence for a 
chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other) 
cancer. The intent of this paper is to review the evidence supporting a 
chemopreventive effect of aspirin, discuss its potential mechanism(s) of action, 
and provide a conceptual framework for assessing current guidelines in the light 
of ongoing studies.

BACKGROUND: The new direct-acting anti-virals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection offer higher cure rates, but at a much higher cost than the standard 
interferon-based treatments.
AIM: To identify the cost-effective treatment for patients with HCV infection 
with F3 liver fibrosis who are at high risk of progression to cirrhosis.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model compared the health benefits and costs 
of all currently licensed treatments as single treatments and in sequential 
therapy of up to three lines. Costs were expressed in pound sterling from the 
perspective of the UK National Health Service. Health benefits were expressed in 
quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: Treatment before progression to cirrhosis always offers the most health 
benefits for the least costs. Sequential therapy with multiple treatment lines 
cures over 89% of patients across all HCV genotypes while ensuring a 
cost-effective use of resources. Cost-effective regimes for HCV genotype 1 
patients include first-line oral therapy with sofosbuvir-ledipasvir while 
peginterferon continues to have a role in other genotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effective treatment for HCV can be established using

In the current era of available therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
life expectancy for persons living with HIV (PLWH) nears that of the general 
population. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has become a 
particular burden for PLWH and society at large. PLWH have historically been 
shown to have an excess of cardiovascular risk and subsequent events when 
compared to the general population. Potential explanations include the increased 
prevalence of traditional risk factors, direct inflammatory and immunological 
effects from the HIV virus itself, and metabolic adverse effects of 
anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Over the past few years, there has been building 
evidence that chronic inflammation and immune activation independent of 
virologic suppression contribute significantly to excess ASCVD risk. Although 
independent agents and combination therapies have varying metabolic effects, the 
evidence from major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supports the benefits of 
early initiation of ART. In this review, we will discuss the epidemiology of 
ASCVD in HIV-infected patients compared with the general population, give an 
overview of potential pathogenesis of high-risk plaque in HIV-infected patients, 
discuss different metabolic effects of individual anti-retrovirals, and discuss 
the limitations in current screening models for assessing cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk and future directions for treatment.

Movement rehabilitation by means of physical therapy represents an essential 
tool in the management of gait disturbances induced by Parkinson's disease (PD). 
In this context, the use of rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) has been proven 
useful in improving several spatio-temporal parameters, but concerning its 
effect on gait patterns, scarce information is available from a kinematic 
viewpoint. In this study, we used three-dimensional gait analysis based on 
optoelectronic stereophotogrammetry to investigate the effects of 5 weeks of 
supervised rehabilitation, which included gait training integrated with RAS on 
26 individuals affected by PD (age 70.4 ± 11.1, Hoehn and Yahr 1-3). Gait 
kinematics was assessed before and at the end of the rehabilitation period and 
after a 3-month follow-up, using concise measures (Gait Profile Score and Gait 
Variable Score, GPS and GVS, respectively), which are able to describe the 
deviation from a physiologic gait pattern. The results confirm the effectiveness 
of gait training assisted by RAS in increasing speed and stride length, in 
regularizing cadence and correctly reweighting swing/stance phase duration. 
Moreover, an overall improvement of gait quality was observed, as demonstrated 
by the significant reduction of the GPS value, which was created mainly through 
significant decreases in the GVS score associated with the hip flexion-extension 
movement. Future research should focus on investigating kinematic details to 
better understand the mechanisms underlying gait disturbances in people with PD 
and the effects of RAS, with the aim of finding new or improving current 
rehabilitative treatments.

OBJECTIVES: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a marker for type 2 airway 
inflammation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
and budget impact of FeNO monitoring for management of adult asthma in Spain.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis model was used to evaluate the effect on 
costs of adding FeNO monitoring to asthma management. Over a 1-year period, the 
model estimated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year and 
incremental number of exacerbations avoided when FeNO monitoring was added to 
standard guideline-driven asthma care compared with standard care alone. 
Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were applied to explore 
uncertainty in the model. A budget impact model was used to examine the impact 
of FeNO monitoring on primary care costs across the Spanish health system.
RESULTS: The results showed that adding FeNO to standard asthma care saved 
€62.53 per patient-year in the adult population and improved quality-adjusted 
life years by 0.026 per patient-year. The budget impact analysis revealed a 
potential net yearly saving of €129 million if FeNO monitoring had been used in 
primary care settings in Spain.
CONCLUSIONS: The present economic model shows that adding FeNO to the treatment 
algorithm can considerably reduce costs and improve quality of life when used to 
manage asthma in combination with current treatment guidelines.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of Botox and 
anticholinergic (AC) medications for the management of urgency urinary 
incontinence (UUI).
METHODS: Cost and effectiveness data were analyzed from participants in the 
Anticholinergic versus Botox Comparison randomized trial of daily AC medication 
versus 100 U of intradetrusor Botox injection. Societal costs included the 
following: treatment costs, patient costs, and medical and nonmedical 
utilization during the 6-month trial. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
calculated based on questionnaire-derived utility measures and annualized based 
on data collected at baseline through 6 months. We also estimated the average 
direct costs for each treatment through 9 months - the duration of time when 
approximately half the Botox participants maintained adequate symptom control.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed on the 231 women who completed a 6-month follow-up 
in the Anticholinergic versus Botox Comparison trial (119 AC and 112 Botox). The 
mean reduction in UUI episodes per day was not significantly different per 
group. The cumulative mean direct costs through the first 6 months also were 
similar: $1339 for the AC group and $1266 for the Botox group with AC costs 
exceeding Botox costs after 5 months. Both groups had considerable QALY gains. 
Annualizing the 6-month trial results to a 12-month measure, the AC and Botox 
groups averaged 0.702 and 0.707 QALYs, respectively. Estimates through 9 months 
favored Botox, showing that AC participants incurred a higher cost per month of 
adequate symptoms control ($305) compared with Botox participants ($207).
CONCLUSIONS: Botox and AC medications have similar costs and effectiveness in 
the first 6 months of UUI treatment. If costs and outcomes are considered 
through 9 months, Botox may have significantly lower costs but similar UUI 
symptom control as AC.

OBJECTIVE: Cardiopulmonary manifestations have an important impact on the life 
expectancy of SSc patients. Functional and morphological macrovascular changes 
may appear early before the development of ischaemic symptoms. Several 
non-invasive methods are used in cardiovascular risk assessment. Heterogeneous 
data are available regarding these in SSc. We aimed to perform a systematic 
review and meta-analysis to characterize the importance of atherosclerosis in 
SSc.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify controlled 
studies on carotid intima-media thickness, flow- or nitrate-induced 
vasodilatation (flow-mediated dilatation, nitroglycerine-mediated dilatation), 
pulse wave velocity, augmentation index and ankle-brachial pressure index. 
Outcomes were pooled with the random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies comprising a total of 1292 SSc patients qualified. 
Intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity and ankle-augmentation index were 
higher and flow-mediated dilatation lower in SSc patients [standardized mean 
difference (SMD) 0.65 (95% CI: 0.29, 1.01), 0.62 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.88), 0.96 (95% 
CI: 0.45, 1.47) and -0.68 (95% CI: -1.39, -0.34), respectively, P < 0.01 for 
each]. Nitroglycerine-mediated dilatation and ankle-brachial pressure index were 
lower, but not significantly [SMD: -0.16 (95% CI: -0.50, 0.18) and -0.39 (95% 
CI: -0.91, 0.13), respectively]. Data showed high to moderate inconsistency and 
significant heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis of the SMD and the disease 
duration found a regression coefficient of 0.086, P = 0.014, confirming that 
parameters of the included SSc population may have contributed to the 
heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis of the published observational studies confirms that 
abnormalities attributable to macrovascular involvement are significantly more 
prevalent in SSc patients compared with controls. Considering the increasing 
importance of cardiovascular disease in SSc, a more widespread use of 
cardiovascular risk assessment is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) and leukotriene receptor 
antagonists (LTRA) are the major add-on treatments in older adults with 
persistent asthma when inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) fail to achieve adequate 
asthma control.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of ICS + LABA treatment compared with 
ICS + LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with ICS + LABA treatment versus ICS 
+ LTRA treatment in older adults with asthma in the United States from the 
health system perspective. The HCUPnet 2010 national statistics were used to 
extract the costs associated with asthma and cardiovascular hospitalizations, 
and inpatient mortality associated with these events. Event probabilities were 
predicted using Medicare 2009-2010 claims for older adults with asthma. 
Treatment costs were estimated on the basis of average wholesale drug price 
listings, and utility estimates were extracted from the literature. To account 
for uncertainty, one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The model predicted that, compared with ICS + LTRA treatment, ICS + 
LABA treatment costs $5,823 more while gaining 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $209,090 per 
QALY. Hospitalization probabilities and posthospitalization utilities were the 
most influential parameters in the one-way sensitivity analysis. Probabilistic 
uncertainty analysis using Monte-Carlo simulations showed that the probabilities 
that ICS + LTRA treatment is cost-effective compared with ICS + LABA treatment 
are 77% and 62% at $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY gained willingness-to-pay 
thresholds, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of ICS + LABA treatment is economically 
unfavorable in older adults when compared with LTRA as add-on treatment.

BACKGROUND: Many health care systems claim to incorporate the cost-effectiveness 
criterion in their investment decisions. Information on the system's willingness 
to pay per effectiveness unit, normally measured as quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), however, is not available in most countries. This is partly because of 
the controversy that remains around the use of a cost-effectiveness threshold, 
about what the threshold ought to represent, and about the appropriate 
methodology to arrive at a threshold value.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article was to identify and critically appraise the 
conceptual perspectives and methodologies used to date to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness threshold.
METHODS: We provided an in-depth discussion of different conceptual views and 
undertook a systematic review of empirical analyses. Identified studies were 
categorized into the two main conceptual perspectives that argue that the 
threshold should reflect 1) the value that society places on a QALY and 2) the 
opportunity cost of investment to the system given budget constraints.
RESULTS: These studies showed different underpinning assumptions, strengths, and 
limitations, which are highlighted and discussed. Furthermore, this review 
allowed us to compare the cost-effectiveness threshold estimates derived from 
different types of studies. We found that thresholds based on society's 
valuation of a QALY are generally larger than thresholds resulting from 
estimating the opportunity cost to the health care system.
CONCLUSIONS: This implies that some interventions with positive social net 
benefits, as informed by individuals' preferences, might not be an appropriate 
use of resources under fixed budget constraints.

BACKGOUND: The Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) has been the subject of controversy since 
its inception, with critics arguing that it creates a "backdoor" to the National 
Health Service (NHS), circumventing the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence and its health technology assessment program. Nonetheless, with its 
creation comes a new decision problem, how to best allocate resources among 
cancer drugs.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to estimate CDF's willingness and ability to pay 
for cancer drugs, providing guidance regarding where CDF funds are best spent, 
and determining the number of NHS quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) displaced 
through the existence of the fund.
METHODS: Using CDF utilization figures, cost-per-QALY, and treatment episode 
costs from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence health technology 
assessment reports, the league-table approach was applied to determine 
appropriate cost-effectiveness thresholds to inform the CDF's decision making.
RESULTS: The CDF exhibits a willingness-to-pay value of £223,627 per QALY, with 
74% and 33% of expenditure for drugs with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
of more than £50,000 and more than £90,000, respectively. During 2013-2014, CDF 
expenditure generated 4,677 QALYs, compared with a potential 13,485 if the same 
funds were used as part of routine NHS commissioning, displacing 8,808 QALYs. By 
ring fencing 10%, 25%, and 50% of the CDF budget for the provision of 
unevaluated drugs, cost-effectiveness thresholds of £149,000, £111,400, and 
£68,600 were calculated, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the proposed framework for CDF prioritization would result 
in disinvestment from a number of highly cost-ineffective drugs applicable for 
CDF reimbursement. The present lack of a formal economic evaluation not only 
results in net health losses but also compromises a founding principle of the 
NHS, that of "equal access for equal need."

OBJECTIVE: Aneurysm rupture is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and 
evidence suggests shared risk for both abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and 
intracranial aneurysms (IAs). We hypothesized that screening for AAA in patients 
with known IA is cost-effective.
METHODS: We used a decision tree model to compare costs and outcomes of AAA 
screening vs no screening in a hypothetical cohort of patients with IA. We 
measured expected outcomes using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We performed a Monte Carlo 
simulation and additional sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of ranging 
base case variables on model outcomes and identified thresholds where a decision 
alternative dominated the model (both less expensive and more effective than the 
alternative).
RESULTS: In our base case analysis, screening for AAA provided an additional 
0.17 QALY (2.5-97.5 percentile: 0.11-0.27 QALY) at a saving of $201 (2.5-97.5 
percentile: $-127 to $896). This yielded an ICER of $-1150/QALY (2.5-97.5 
percentile: $-4299 to $6374/QALY), that is, screening saves $1150 per QALY
