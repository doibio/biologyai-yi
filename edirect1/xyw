to estimate the impact of diabetes on life expectancy, health-adjusted life 
expectancy (HALE), and HRQOL.
RESULTS: Life expectancy of people with diabetes was 64.7 and 70.7 years for men 
and women, respectively-12.8 and 12.2 years less than that for men and women 
without diabetes. Diabetes had a large impact on instrumental and basic 
activities of daily living, more so than on functional health. HALE was 58.3 and 
62.7 years, respectively, for men and women-11.9 and 10.7 years less than that 
of men and women without diabetes. Eliminating diabetes would increase Ontario 
life expectancy by 2.8 years for men and 2.6 years for women; HALE would 
increase by 2.7 and 3.2 years for men and women, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of illness from diabetes in Ontario is considerable. 
Efforts to reduce diabetes would likely result in a "compression of morbidity." 
An approach of estimating diabetes burden using linked data sources provides a 
robust approach for the surveillance of diabetes.

Heidelberg-Medical School, Im Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.

Based on a demographic surveillance population from 39 villages in rural Burkina 
Faso, we describe mortality patterns in adults (15-59 years) and older people (> 
or = 60 years), and discuss seasonal trends in mortality. During the study 
period 1993-1998, 589 deaths in adults and 593 deaths in older people were 
recorded from an average adult and older people population of 13 550. The crude 
all-cause mortality rate per 1000 for adults was 7.3 (95 per cent confidence 
interval (CI) 6.7-7.8) and for older people 55.8 (95 percent CI 51.3-60.3). The 
probability of dying before age 60 after reaching age 15 was 34 percent for 
males and 32 percent for females. Malaria and diarrhoea, recorded through verbal 
autopsy, accounted for 21 percent of total deaths in adults and 22 per cent in 
older people. A seasonal trend in mortality for older people with a peak in 
February was identified. The study shows that malaria is an important cause of 
death in adulthood.

Community-based study of the association of high myopia in children with ocular 
and systemic disease.

University, Birmingham, United Kingdom. n.s.logan@aston.ac.uk

PURPOSE: High myopia in childhood is associated with important ocular and 
systemic conditions. However in the UK, high myopia in early childhood is not 
specifically identified in current ophthalmology, optometry, or orthoptic 
protocols for screening, referral, or investigation. An ongoing study in the 
West Midlands, UK, is investigating high myopia presenting to community health 
care clinics with the aim of compiling guidelines for assessment and subsequent 
referral.
METHODS: Children with high myopia were identified from community optometric and 
orthoptic sources and invited for an ophthalmology and optometry examination to 
ascertain possible ocular or systemic disease.
RESULTS: High myopia with no associated ocular or systemic condition was present 
in 15 (56%) of the children. In seven children (25%), associated ocular problems 
were found including unrecognized retinal dystrophies and amblyopia. Systemic 
disorders associated with high myopia were found in five children (19%) and 
included Sticklers syndrome, Weill-Marchesani syndrome, and homocystinuria. In 
one child, the diagnosis made before this study was found to be incorrect, and 
in another child, the results were inconclusive. In two cases, the diagnosis of 
a systemic condition in the child led to the identification of the disease in at 
least one relative.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of ocular and systemic abnormality in 
young children seen in the community. Optometric and ophthalmologic assessment 
of children less than 10 years with myopia > or =5 D is likely to identify 
significant ocular or systemic disease, a proportion of which will respond to 
medical intervention. Detection and prompt referral of these cases by community 
health care services may be expected to prolong vision and possibly life 
expectancy.

Estimating life expectancy and related probabilities in screen-detected breast 
cancer patients with restricted follow-up information.

Issues such as life expectancy after diagnosis, the number of life years gained 
by early diagnosis through screening, the probability of dying from breast 
cancer or of dying from other causes during the lead time period or thereafter 
can be derived from information on complete survival after diagnosis. A method 
is presented to estimate complete survival and relevant outcomes after diagnosis 
of screen-detected cancer when the follow-up period is substantially shorter 
than the maximum follow-up possible. Survival after diagnosis until death from 
breast cancer is modelled as the sum of the lead time (LT) and the post-lead 
time (PLT), where both time periods follow exponential distributions and are 
assumed to be independent. The survival period after diagnosis until death from 
causes other than breast cancer (X) is assumed to follow a Gompertz 
distribution. The survival period after diagnosis until death from any cause (Z) 
is modelled as the minimum of LT+PLT and X. Maximum likelihood methods were then 
used to estimate all parameters of Z. This procedure for obtaining maximum 
likelihood estimates of Z does not need the cause of death (breast cancer or 
other), which is an advantage over most other methods. Especially in older 
patients, it may be difficult or even impossible to ascertain the true cause of 
death. The model was applied to data from the long-term breast cancer screening 
programme in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Complete survival was estimated on the 
basis of survival data on 528 screen-detected breast cancer patients, diagnosed 
in 1975-1997 and with a mean follow-up of 8.9 years. Estimated life expectancy 
ranged between 22.3 and 9.0 years for patients diagnosed at the age of 50 and 79 
years, respectively, that is, 6.1 and 0.7 life years gained by screening. 
Through early diagnosis and treatment, screen-detected patients diagnosed at the 
age of 50 years may have reduced their lifetime risk of dying from breast cancer 
from 79 per cent to 56 per cent; at the age of 79 the reduction of risk is 
reduced from 23 per cent to 13 per cent.

BACKGROUND: Excess lung cancer mortality among the exposed Vermont granite 
workers has been reported. These studies were based on job and tenure 
surrogates, with the potential for misclassification and inability to evaluate 
quantitative exposure-response.
METHODS: Industrial hygiene data collected from 1924 to 1977 was analyzed in 
conjunction with mortality data to examine quantitative exposure-response for 
silica, lung cancer, and other lung diseases. A person-years analysis was 
undertaken by cumulative exposure group, including lagged and unlagged 
tabulations. Poisson models were fitted to untransformed and log transformed 
exposure.
RESULTS: The results indicated a clear relationship of lung cancer, 
tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, non-malignant lung disease, and kidney cancer with 
cumulative exposure. An exposure to 0.05 mg/m(3) from age 20 to 64 was 
associated with a lifetime excess risk of lung cancer for white males of 
27/1,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study of workers exposed almost exclusively to 
silica and no other major occupational confounding exposures indicate a clear 
exposure-response for lung cancer.

Perioperative death in Malaysia: the transition phase from a developing nation 
to a developed one.

This paper examines the surgical pathology associated with perioperative deaths 
in a country that is undergoing the transition from a developing to a developed 
nation status. The data from an ongoing nation-wide perioperative mortality 
study was prospectively collected for the period July 1996 to December 1997 and 
analyzed. The surgical pathology related to perioperative deaths in Malaysia is 
different from other developing and developed countries. While death from trauma 
and the late presentation of surgical conditions are similar to developing 
countries, infective gastrointestinal conditions were rarely encountered. 
Diseases associated with advanced age such as colorectal cancer, peptic ulcer, 
urological diseases and vascular conditions are beginning to emerge. As the 
country races towards a developed nation status, increasing life expectancy and 
changing life-styles are expected to influence the disease pattern. The planning 
of surgical facilities and manpower development must recognize the changes 
taking place.

Author information:
(1)Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California at San 
Diego, San Diego, California 92093-0994, USA. egroessl@ucsd.edu

BACKGROUND: The impact of obesity and associated conditions on health has not 
been assessed in older adults using a generic, utility-based measure of 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study evaluates the relationship 
between body mass index (BMI) and HRQOL scores and gives estimates of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost to overweight, obesity, and associated 
conditions.
METHODS: A total of 1326 adults from the Rancho Bernardo longitudinal cohort 
study, with a mean age of 72 years, completed the Quality of Well-Being Scale 
(QWB), a generic health-related quality of life measure. Height, weight, 
exercise, and smoking status were also assessed. Differences in QWB scores 
between obese adults and those with a normal BMI were used to estimate the QALYs 
lost due to obesity and associated conditions.
RESULTS: Participants were divided into four groups based on BMI: <20 
(underweight); 20 to 24.9 (normal); 25 to 29.9 (overweight); >30 kg/m(2) 
(obese). Analysis of covariance controlling for age, gender, smoking history, 
and exercise showed a significant difference between group means 
(F(7,1310)=30.79; p <0.001). The normal BMI group had the highest QWB score 
(0.709), followed by the underweight (0.698), overweight (0.695), and obese 
(0.663) groups. The QWB score for the obese group was significantly lower than 
that for the normal and overweight groups. An estimated 2.93 million QALYs are 
lost in this country each year from obesity and associated conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Obese older adults tend to have lower HRQOL than those who are 
overweight or of normal BMI. The lower QWB scores associated with obesity 
translate into millions of QALYs lost each year. Being overweight but not obese 
did not have a significant impact on HRQOL in this population.

MC, Olsson CA, McKiernan JM.

and Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, New York 
10032, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the natural history of patients younger than 40 years 
(young patient [YP] group) who are diagnosed with a sporadic renal cortical 
tumor (RCT) and to compare the natural history of these patients with the more 
typical older patient (OP) with RCT.
METHODS: We reviewed our database and identified 34 patients (younger than 40 
years old, median age 35) who underwent surgery for a sporadic RCT. The YP group 
outcomes were compared with 100 patients between 41 and 85 years (median 65). We 
fit a Cox proportional hazards model to examine the relationship between age at 
presentation and recurrence risk.
RESULTS: The median tumor size in the YP group was 3.8 cm (range 0.6 to 19) and 
in the OP group was 5.0 cm (range 0.9 to 22; P = 0.225). Tumors were discovered 
incidentally in 51% and 56% of the YP and OP groups, respectively (P = 0.65). 
The frequency of partial nephrectomy did not differ between the two groups (35% 
YP and 30% OP, P = 0.55). The frequency of malignant histologic subtypes did not 
differ between the groups (P = 0.439). In the YP group, only larger tumor size 
(hazard ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.50, P = 0.034) was 
associated with a statistically significant increased risk of recurrence. Those 
in the YP group were not more or less likely to develop recurrence than those in 
the OP group (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 2.85, P = 
0.72). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 73% and 80% in the YP and OP 
groups, respectively (P = 0.23). The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 
85% and 84% in the YP and OP groups, respectively (P = 0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our study indicate that the natural history of RCTs 
is similar in both younger and older patients. Young patients were neither more 
nor less likely to develop recurrence compared with their older counterparts.

Concurrent chemoradiotherapy for clinical stage T2 bladder cancer: report of a 
single institution.

Peyromaure M(1), Slama J, Beuzeboc P, Ponvert D, DebrÃ© B, Zerbib M.

(1)Department of Urology, Cochin Hospital, Paris, France.

OBJECTIVES: To report our experience with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for 
clinical Stage T2 bladder cancer.
METHODS: From 1996 to 2002, 43 patients were treated with concurrent 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy for clinical Stage T2 bladder cancer. After 
complete bladder transurethral resection, all patients underwent chemotherapy, 
consisting of one daily infusion of cisplatin at a dose of 15 mg/m2 and 
5-fluorouracil at a dose of 400 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 3 (first cycle) and days 15 
to 17 (second cycle). Pelvic irradiation was administered at a dose of 24 Gy, 
using two daily fractions of 3 Gy on days 1, 3, 15, and 17. Random biopsies were 
performed 6 weeks after the end of the first two cycles. Patients with 
persistent invasive tumor underwent cystectomy; others received two additional 
cycles of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 36.3 months (range 3 to 72). Nine patients 
underwent early cystectomy for nonresponse, and 2 patients underwent delayed 
cystectomy. The overall rate of cystectomy was 25.6%. The rate of specific 
survival at 3 and 5 years was 75% and 60%, respectively. The overall rate of 
recurrence-free survival at 3 and 5 years was 63% and 33%, respectively. Two 
factors correlated with patient survival: the presence of carcinoma in situ at 
first resection (P = 0.01) and the response after the first two cycles (half 
dose; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is less effective 
than primary cystectomy for clinical Stage T2 bladder cancer. This treatment may 
be unwarranted in patients with concomitant carcinoma in situ at the first 
resection.

Treatment options for localized prostate cancer: quality-adjusted life years and 
the effects of lead-time.

Author information:

Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, California 92161, USA.

OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to estimate the difference in 
quality-adjusted life-years between conservative management and prostatectomy or 
radiotherapy (RT) by clinical Gleason score (2 to 4, 5 to 6, 7, and 8 to 10) for 
patients aged 55 years and older with clinically localized prostate cancer and 
to adjust for and explore the effects of lead-time. For localized prostate 
cancer, it is not known whether treatment (prostatectomy or RT) results in 
longer quality-adjusted survival than conservative management. Observed survival 
benefits after treatment may be biased by the lead-time resulting from early 
diagnosis with prostate-specific antigen screening.
METHODS: A Markov simulation was developed, and transition probabilities were 
derived from a review of published studies. Utility weights were measured in 
male volunteers older than 60 years. Estimates of disease progression during 
conservative management were adjusted for lead-time. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed on all parameters (including estimates for lead-time).
RESULTS: For Gleason score 2 to 4 cancer, conservative management yielded the 
greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years. For Gleason score 5 to 6 cancer, 
any of the options appeared beneficial, depending on the estimates for disease 
progression. For Gleason score 7 to 10 cancer, prostatectomy and RT resulted in 
more quality-adjusted life-years than conservative management; with a lead-time 
adjustment of greater than 10 years, the outcomes with conservative management 
and prostatectomy were similar. The choice between prostatectomy and RT was 
sensitive to estimates of disease progression after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Conservative management is a reasonable option for Gleason score 2 
to 4 cancer and for some patients with Gleason score 5 to 6 cancer. 
Prostatectomy or RT is recommended for Gleason score 7 to 10 cancer. The 
survival benefits after treatment were not explained by the lead-time alone.

Phase I and clinical pharmacology of a type I and II, 5-alpha-reductase 
inhibitor (LY320236) in prostate cancer: elevation of estradiol as possible 
mechanism of action.

OBJECTIVES: To study the safety, pharmacokinetics, biologic activity, and 
preliminary efficacy of the bispecific 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (LY320236) in 
prostate cancer.
METHODS: Fifty-one patients with recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer were 
sequentially (nonrandomly) assigned in cohorts to receive one of five single 
daily oral doses of LY320236 (10, 50, 150, 250, and 500 mg). Serial evaluations 
included serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenediol glucuronide, 
estradiol, and pharmacokinetics on days 1, 29, and 57. Toxicity assessments, 
x-rays/scans, and blood tests, including serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
determination, were done at regular intervals.
RESULTS: Overall, treatment was well tolerated, with 3 of 51 patients developing 
reversible grade 3-4 toxicity (one diarrhea, two elevated liver enzymes). Peak 
blood levels (2 to 3 hours after drug administration) were greater for doses of 
150 mg or greater compared with less than 150-mg doses with slow accumulation. 
Serum levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenediol 
glucuronide did not change significantly during treatment; however, a 
statistically significant increase occurred in serum estradiol levels in both 
the castration and noncastration groups. One of 26 in the noncastration group 
and 4 (27%) of 15 in the castration group with baseline PSA levels of 5 ng/mL or 
greater had a 50% or greater PSA decline for 4 weeks or longer.
CONCLUSIONS: LY320236 treatment is associated with modest reversible toxicity. 
An elevation of estradiol levels was seen in both castration and noncastration 
groups, although PSA declines were primarily seen in the castration group. The 
absence of cardiovascular toxicity suggests that this agent may be a promising 
alternative to exogenous estrogens in patients with prostate cancer who 
demonstrate evidence of disease progression after initial androgen deprivation 
treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate prospectively the combination of a luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone analog with a somatostatin analog and dexamethasone in 
patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) in a randomized Phase II 
study. HRPC presents a challenging therapeutic problem. Salvage chemotherapy is 
the usual approach at this stage of the disease. The combination of a 
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog with a somatostatin analog and 
dexamethasone has produced objective clinical responses in HRPC.
METHODS: Forty patients with HRPC were randomized to receive one of two 
treatments. Group 1 underwent chemotherapy (estramustine 140 mg three times 
daily and etoposide 100 mg orally for 21 days) and group 2 the combination of a 
somatostatin analog (lanreotide 30 mg intramuscularly every 14 days) and 
dexamethasone (4 mg tapered to 1 mg), in addition to androgen ablation by 
orchiectomy or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog (triptorelin 3.75 
mg intramuscularly every 28 days). The clinical and prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) response, overall survival, time to progression, and toxicity were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The data of 20 patients in group 1 and 18 in group 2 were analyzed. The 
demographic and clinical data were similar in the two groups at study entry. A 
PSA response (decrease of greater than 50%) was observed in 45% of group 1 and 
44% of group 2. The difference was not statistically significant. A partial 
clinical response was observed in 29% and 30% of groups 1 and 2, respectively. 
Again, the difference was not statistically significant. Changes in performance 
status and pain score during treatment were not significantly different in the 
two groups. Hematologic toxicity was more frequent in group 1 (80% of patients), 
and mild diabetes was more frequent in group 2 (22% of patients). The overall 
survival was 18.8 months in group 1 and 18 months in group 2 (not statistically 
significant). The time to progression was 6 versus 4 months and, in the PSA 
responder subgroup, it was 8 versus 7.7 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively 
(neither difference was statistically significant).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our randomized Phase II study indicated that the new 
combination treatment (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog, 
somatostatin analog, and dexamethasone) may be equally effective as salvage 
chemotherapy in patients with HRPC in terms of the clinical and PSA response, 
overall survival, and time to progression. A larger prospective Phase III trial 
is required to confirm our observations.

    BMJ. 2004 Feb 14;328(7436):360-1.

OBJECTIVE: To establish which attributes of conservative treatments for prostate 
cancer are most important to men.
DESIGN: Discrete choice experiment.
SETTING: Two London hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: 129 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer, mean age 70 years; 69 
of 118 (58%) with T stage 1 or 2 cancer at diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Men's preferences for, and trade-offs between, the 
attributes of diarrhoea, hot flushes, ability to maintain an erection, breast 
swelling or tenderness, physical energy, sex drive, life expectancy, and out of 
pocket expenses.
RESULTS: The men's responses to changes in attributes were all statistically 
significant. When asked to assume a starting life expectancy of five years, the 
men were willing to make trade-offs between life expectancy and side effects. On 
average, they were most willing to give up life expectancy to avoid limitations 
in physical energy (mean three months) and least willing to trade life 
expectancy to avoid hot flushes (mean 0.6 months to move from a moderate to mild 
level or from mild to none).
CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer are willing to participate in a relatively 
complex exercise that weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of various 
conservative treatments for their condition. They were willing to trade off some

AIMS: It is known that epileptic seizures can present not only in neurological 
diseases but also in a number of different medical diseases, and are important 
in the prognosis and treatment of the primary disease. The purpose of this study 
is to review a series of patients with epilepsy whose therapy involves a series 
of peculiarities.
DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the treatment of epilepsy in groups of patients with 
the following characteristics: mental disability, cardiovascular disease, 
respiratory disease, liver failure, hepatic porphyrias, liver transplant, kidney 
failure, haemodialysis, kidney transplant, infectious diseases, acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome, diseases of the digestive tract, endocrine diseases, 
preventive antiepileptic therapy, and surgical diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in life expectancy, together with the ensuing growth 
in the number of medical diseases, surgical procedures and pharmacological 
treatments, means that we often have to deal with epileptic seizures in these 
groups of patients. Many of the epileptic seizures presented in these patients 
are generally of the acute symptomatic type; they therefore require no long-term 
antiepileptic treatment and have a good prognosis, once the situation or disease 
that triggers them is righted or treated. When it comes to choosing a possible 
antiepileptic drug for these patients, basically all the pharmacological 
treatments for these medical diseases must be considered. This is because of the 
possible interactions that may reciprocally alter the effectiveness of the two 
types of drugs and, similarly, their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic behaviour 
and preferred choice of pathways.

Will developments in allogeneic transplantation influence treatment of adult 
patients with sickle cell disease?

United Kingdom. suparno@doctors.org.uk

With improvements in the treatment of children with sickle cell disease (SCD), 
there has been a significant increase in the number of patients with SCD in 
adult hematology practice. Quality of life and life expectancy continue to be 
severely compromised in adult patients; hydroxyurea is the only treatment 
currently available that could reduce the severity and frequency of painful 
episodes. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has been offered to 
children with SCD as a curative option. We discuss the implications of new 
developments in the field of allogeneic SCT in the treatment of adult SCD 
patients in light of the experience derived from pediatric transplantation. 
These developments include innovations in the conditioning regimens, GVHD 
prophylaxis, and alternative donor SCT and their possible effect on adult SCD 
patients. Finally, we discuss a nonmyeloablative conditioning protocol for adult 
SCD patients and the eligibility criteria for adult SCD patients undergoing 
allogeneic transplantation.

Tennessee, USA. victoria.marchese@stjude.org

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of physical 
therapy intervention in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
PROCEDURE: Twenty-eight children aged 4-15 years were randomly assigned to an 
intervention or control group. The intervention group received five sessions of 
physical therapy and was instructed to perform an individualized home exercise 
program consisting of ankle dorsiflexion stretching, lower extremity 
strengthening, and aerobic exercise.
RESULTS: After 4 months children who received physical therapy intervention had 
significantly improved ankle dorsiflexion active range of motion and knee 
extension strength (P < 0.01). Differences were not found between the two groups 
for any of the other dependent variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapy intervention for children with ALL receiving 
maintenance chemotherapy improved two body functions important for normal gait. 
Physical therapy programs initiated earlier in treatment and with greater 
emphasis on endurance activities may also improve stamina and quality of life 
(QOL).

OBJECTIVE: To measure parents' and other adults' values for preventing disease 
associated with pneumococcal infection and to evaluate how including these 
values changes the economic appraisal of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
METHODS: Data on preferences and willingness to pay to reduce risk of illness 
were collected for 6 illnesses that are preventable by pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (simple otitis media, complex otitis media, moderate pneumonia, severe 
pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis) and 1 vaccine-related adverse event 
(fever and fussiness after vaccine). Interviews were conducted with 2 groups of 
respondents: 1) parents of children who had experienced 1 or more of the 
outcomes described in the survey (n = 101) and 2) a US community sample (n = 
109). The 30-minute telephone interview used modified time trade-off questions 
and willingness-to-pay questions. Values from the interview were incorporated in 
an existing decision-analytic model that simulated the cost-effectiveness and 
cost-benefit of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a hypothetical cohort of 
newborns.
RESULTS: Among parents, the median amount of time that respondents said that 
they would be willing to trade to avoid diseases ranged from 0 days for otitis 
media to 1 year for severe pneumonia and 2 years for meningitis. Among the US 
community sample, the median amounts of time traded were higher, ranging from 7 
days for otitis media to 3 years for meningitis. Median willingness-to-pay 
amounts varied from 100 dollars to prevent 1 episode of otitis media and 500 
dollars to reduce the risk of meningitis from 21 in 100 000 to 6 in 100 000 and 
were similar between parents and community members. Incorporating time trade-off 
amounts into the existing economic model for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
resulted in cost-effectiveness ratios <10 000 dollars per quality-adjusted life 
year at a vaccine cost of 58 dollars per dose.
CONCLUSIONS: Both parents and community members assign relatively high values to 
preventing meningitis, pneumonia, and complex otitis media. When the value of 
preventing pneumococcal diseases is incorporated into economic analyses, 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has a cost-effectiveness ratio in the range of 
other widely used health interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical 
screening program for untreated amblyopia in 3-year-old children conducted by 
orthoptists in all German kindergartens in the year 2000.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed for which a decision tree was 
combined with a Markov model. Incremental costs and effects during the 
children's remaining lifetime were estimated. The model took into account the 
probability of treatment without screening, age-specific treatment success 
rates, costs of screening and treatment, as well as effects of unilateral and 
bilateral visual impairment caused by amblyopia and other eye diseases coming 
along later in life on quality of life (utility). Model parameter values were 
obtained from a field study of orthoptic screening in kindergarten, from the 
literature, and from expert interviews. Costs were estimated from a third-party 
payer perspective. Uncertainty was assessed by univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (Monte Carlo simulation).
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of orthoptic screening 
was 7397 Euro (euro) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) when costs and 
effects were discounted at 5%. In univariate sensitivity analysis, the ICER was 
sensitive to the uncertainty regarding the utility of unilateral visual 
impairment and to the discount rate for effects; besides uncertainty regarding 
the prevalence of untreated amblyopia, the odds ratio of success of treatment 
when started late, and the probability of treatment without screening had a 
noticeable but much smaller effect. Monte Carlo simulation yielded a 90% 
uncertainty interval for the ICER of 3452 euro/QALY to 72 637 euro/QALY; the 
probability of an ICER <25 000 euro/QALY was 84%.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICER of orthoptic screening seems to fall within a range that 
warrants careful consideration by decision-makers. Much of the uncertainty in 
results comes from the uncertainty regarding the effect of amblyopia on quality 
of life. To reduce this uncertainty, the impact of amblyopia on utility should 
be investigated.

Known as a systemic disease, genetically conditioned, mucoviscidosis or cystic 
fibrosis brings together chronic obstructive bronchopathy, manifested since 
early childhood, chronic bronchial infection especially with pseudomonas or 
staphylococcus aureus, pancreatic impairment and a high clorum ratio in sweats. 
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is inducing the disease, 1 
of 20 caucasians being carriers of this marker. Positive diagnosis is suggested 
when respiratory and digestive symptoms meet fertility disfunction and "salty 
kiss" due to sodium--clorure disorders and confirmed by chest X-ray, spirogram, 
bacteriologic exam of sputum, genetic analysis and positive tests of the 
pancreatic enzymes and sweat's test. As regards therapeutical solutions, besides 
antibiotics required in infectious exacerbation, corticotherapy, kinesitherapy 
and alpha dornasis given in aerosols to improve bronchial mucosa's clearance, 
also substitutes of pancreatic enzymes and hypercaloric diet are to be 
considered. In the last two decades, lung transplant appeared to be as an 
alternative to improve poor prognosis of this disease. Recent studies reported 
that life expectancy in cystic fibrosis will increase from 28 years in the '90s 
to 40 years in the next 20 years.

Sublethal effects of the growth inhibitor, clofentezine, on life-table 
parameters of Tetranychus urticae Koch females treated at different 
developmental stages with a concentration causing >90% mortality were 
investigated. Females which survived treatment as 'early' (0-24 h old) eggs 
produced 12% more offspring than the untreated females during the first five 
days of oviposition. This resulted in a significant rise in the intrinsic rate 
of increase (rj): 0.324, compared to 0.299 in the untreated females. This effect 
may be interpreted as hormoligosis. Clofentezine treatment at any other 
developmental stage of T. urticae significantly decreased both longevity and 
fertility of female survivors. Females which survived treatment either as 'late' 
(72-96 h old) eggs or larvae had 2.6 times lower net reproductive rate (R0) than 
the untreated females, and the rj values were significantly lower: 0.242 and 
0.215, respectively (0.285 in the untreated females). Females which survived 
treatment either as protonymphs or deutonymphs had 3.9 times and 6 times lower 
R0, respectively. Corresponding rj values were 0.178 and 0.146, respectively 
(0.247 in the untreated females). The clofentezine treatment at all stages 
influenced the age distribution of survivors. The sublethal effects of 
clofentezine and their impact on T. urticae management are discussed.

Effects of prey mite species on life history of the phytoseiid predators 
Typhlodromalus manihoti and Typhlodromalus aripo.

The effects of prey mite suitability on several demographic characteristics of 
phytoseiid predators and the relationship of these effects to the potential of 
phytoseiid predators to control herbivorous mite populations are well 
documented. Evidence has also accumulated in the last 20 years demonstrating 
that phytoseiid predators utilize herbivorous prey mite-induced plant volatiles 
as olfactory cues in locating their herbivorous mite prey. but less well 
established is the predictability of reproductive success from the ability of 
the predators to utilize olfactory cues to locate their prey, and how these 
processes are related to the success of the predators as biological control 
agents of the herbivorous mite. In this study, we determined in laboratory no 
choice experiments, the development, survivorship and fecundity of the two 
neotropical phytoseiid predators Typhlodromalus manihoti Moraes and T. aripo 
DeLeon when feeding on three herbivorous mites, including the key prey species 
Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar), and the two alternative prey species Oligonychus 
gossypii (Zacher) and Tetranychus urticae (Koch). Intrinsic rate of increase 
(rm) of T. aripo was 2.1 fold higher on M. tanajoa as prey compared with T. 
urticae as prey, while it was almost nil on O. gossypii. For T. manihoti, rm was 
2.3 fold higher on M. tanajoa as prey compared with O. gossypii as prey, while 
reproduction was nil on T. urticae. An independent experiment on odor-related 
prey preference of the two predator species (Gnanvossou et al. 2002) showed that 
T. manihoti and T. aripo preferred odors from M. tanajoa-infested leaves to 
odors from O. gossypii-infested leaves. Moreover, both predator species 
preferred odors from M. tanajoa-infested leaves over those from T. 
urticae-infested leaves. As reported here, life history of the two predatory 
mites matches odor-related prey preference if the key prey species is compared 
to the two inferior prey species. The implications of our findings for the 
persistence of T. manihoti and T. aripo and biological control of M. tanajoa in 
the cassava agroecosystem in Africa are discussed.

OBJECTIVES: Postmenopausal osteoporosis is becoming a major problem for 
healthcare institutions as it has a growing social and economic impact. The 
incidence of osteoporotic fractures is constantly increasing due to the increase 
in life expectancy. The gynaecologist plays an important role in establishing a 
"biological zero" in each perimenopausal patient, and controlling the rate of 
bone loss during postmenopausal period.
RESULTS: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has been widely used for the 
diagnosis and management of osteoporosis and represents a strong risk factor for 
fractures, but it presents several limitations with regards to diagnosis, 
treatment follow-up and differential diagnosis of secondary osteoporosis. In 
these last years quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique has been introduced for 
the evaluation of bone status in postmenopausal women and several in vitro and 
clinical studies have demonstrated the reliability of the examination in terms 
of: reproducibility, evaluation of fracture risk, treatment follow-up, 
differential diagnosis. QUS has proven to be equally capable in the prediction 
of future osteoporosis related fractures in comparison to DXA. Large-scale 
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated the applicability of 
QUS in screening the female population during the climacteric period. QUS 
technique seems to be very efficient in identifying "fast losers", identifying 
subjects at risk for osteoporosis requiring second-level investigation (DXA, 
X-ray), diagnosing secondary osteoporosis.
CONCLUSION: If QUS is used in a systematic and rational manner in clinical 
practice, it is a valid technique for the prevention of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women.

BACKGROUND: In diabetic patients in the Evaluation of Platelet IIb/IIIa 
Inhibitor for Stenting (EPISTENT) trial, abciximab reduced target vessel 
revascularization by approximately 50% compared with placebo. Whether this is a 
result of a lower restenosis rate caused by inhibition of intimal hyperplasia 
remains to be defined.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
abciximab at the time of stent implantation would reduce in-stent intimal 
hyperplasia measured by intravascular ultrasound at 6-month follow-up in type 2 
diabetics. Ninety-six diabetic patients (96 lesions) who underwent elective 
stent implantation for a de novo lesion in a native coronary artery were 
randomly assigned to receive abciximab or no abciximab. In-stent intimal 
hyperplasia volume, expressed as percentage of stent volume, did not differ 
between groups: 41.3+/-21.0% for those treated with abciximab versus 
40.5+/-18.3% for those treated without abciximab (P=0.9). There were also no 
significant differences in angiographic minimal luminal diameter at follow-up 
(1.74+/-0.69 versus 1.66+/-0.63 mm; P=0.5), late loss (1.03+/-0.63 versus 
1.07+/-0.58 mm; P=0.7), restenosis rate (17.8% versus 22.9%; P=0.5), or 
cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac events at 12 months (19.1% versus 
20.4%; P=0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Six-month intravascular ultrasound volumetric analysis showed that 
abciximab, at the time of coronary stent implantation, was not associated with a 
reduction of in-stent intimal hyperplasia in diabetic patients.

Communities (ARIC) Study Investigators.

Canyon, Tex, USA.

BACKGROUND: Whether diabetic patients without a history of myocardial infarction 
(MI) have the same risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events as nondiabetic 
patients with a history of MI remains controversial. We compared risks of CHD 
and stroke events and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetic 
and nondiabetic men and women with and without a history of MI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed a total of 13 790 African American and white 
men and women ages 45 to 64 years who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk 
in Communities study, beginning in 1987 to 1989. There were 634 fatal CHD or 
nonfatal MI events, 312 fatal or nonfatal strokes, and 358 deaths from CVD 
during an average of 9 years of follow-up (125 998 person-years). After 
adjustment for age, sex, race, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities field center, 
and multiple baseline risk factors, patients who had a history of MI without 
diabetes at baseline had 1.9 times the risk of fatal CHD or nonfatal MI (95% CI, 
1.35 to 2.56; P<0.001) compared with diabetic patients without a prior history 
of MI. The nondiabetic patients with MI also had 1.8 times the risk of CVD 
mortality compared with diabetic patients without MI (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.72; 
P=0.003). However, stroke risk was similar between diabetic patients without MI 
and nondiabetic patients with MI (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.79; P=0.87). We 
also observed that nondiabetic patients with MI had a carotid artery wall 
thickness similar to diabetic patients without MI (P=0.77).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients without MI had lower risk of CHD events and 
mortality from CVD compared with nondiabetic patients with MI, but stroke risk 
was similar between these 2 groups.
