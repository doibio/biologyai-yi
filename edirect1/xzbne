BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are major health problems worldwide. This 
protocol describes the HEALTHI (Healthy Eating and Active LifesTyle Health 
Intervention) Program, a 12-week randomised-controlled weight-loss intervention 
that adopts two theory-based intervention techniques, mental imagery and 
implementation intentions, a behaviour-change technique based on planning that 
have been shown to be effective in promoting health-behaviour change in previous 
research. The effectiveness of goal-reminder text messages to augment 
intervention effects will also be tested. The trial will determine the effects 
of a brief, low cost, theory-based weight-loss intervention to improve dietary 
intake and physical activity behaviour and facilitate weight-loss in overweight 
and obese individuals.
METHODS/DESIGN: Overweight or obese participants will be randomly allocated to 
one of three conditions: (1) a psycho-education plus an implementation 
intentions and mental imagery condition; (2) a psycho-education plus an 
implementation intentions and mental imagery condition with text messages; or 
(3) a psycho-education control condition. The intervention will be delivered via 
video presentation to increase the intervention's applicability in multiple 
contexts and keep costs low. We hypothesise that the intervention conditions 
will lead to statistically-significant changes in the primary and secondary 
outcome variables measured at 6 and 12 weeks post-intervention relative to the 
psycho-education control condition after controlling for baseline values. The 
primary outcome variable will be body weight and secondary outcome variables 
will be biomedical (body mass, body fat percentage, muscle mass, waist-hip 
circumference ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density 
lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, blood 
glucose and insulin levels), psychological (quality of life, motivation, risk 
perception, outcome expectancy, intention, action self-efficacy, maintenance 
self-efficacy, goal setting and planning), and behavioural (self-reported diet 
intake, and physical activity involvement) measures. We also expect the 
intervention condition augmented with text messages to lead to statistically 
significant differences in the primary and secondary outcome variables at the 
follow up periods after controlling for baseline values.
DISCUSSION: The planned trial will test the effectiveness of the theory-based 
HEALTHI program intervention to reduce weight and salient psychological, 
biomedical, and behavioural outcomes in overweight and obese adults. The study 
has been designed to maximise applicability to real world settings and could be 
integrated into existing weight management practices.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of Spinal Cord 
Stimulation (SCS) in patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) 
refractory to conventional medical management (CMM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational, multicenter, longitudinal 
ambispective study, where patients with predominant leg pain refractory to CMM 
expecting to receive SCS+CMM were recruited in 9 Italian centers and followed up 
to 24 months after SCS. We collected data on clinical status (pain intensity, 
disability), Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) and on direct and indirect 
costs before (pre-SCS) and after (post-SCS) the SCS intervention. Costs were 
quantified in € 2009, adopting the National Health Service's (NHS), patient and 
societal perspectives. Benefits and costs pre-SCS versus post-SCS were compared 
to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost utility ratios.
RESULTS: 80 patients (40% male, mean age 58 years) were recruited. Between 
baseline and 24 months post-SCS, clinical outcomes and HRQoL significantly 
improved. The EQ-5D utility index increased from 0.421 to 0.630 (p < 0.0001). 
Statistically significant improvement was first observed six months post-SCS. 
Societal costs increased from €6600 (pre-SCS) to €13,200 (post-SCS) per patient 
per year. Accordingly, the cost-utility acceptability curve suggested that if 
decision makers' willingness to pay per Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs) was 
€60,000, SCS implantation would be cost-effective in 80% and 85% of cases, 
according to the NHS's and societal point of views, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in clinical practice, SCS+CMM treatment of 
FBSS patients refractory to CMM provides good value for money. Further research 
is encouraged in the form of larger, long-term studies.

BACKGROUND: There is a need for more studies investigating the outcome of 
implant-supported rehabilitations in patients with systemic disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective clinical study included 721 patients 
with systemic disorders or smoking habits (422 females; 299 males), with an 
average age of 51 years, rehabilitated with 3,998 implants and followed for 3-17 
years (average 8 years). Outcome measures were: implant survival rates 
calculated based on implant function through life tables and using the patient 
(first implant failure censored) and implant as units of analysis; marginal bone 
levels measured at 1, 5, and 10 years; and the incidence of biological 
complications (peri-implant pathology, abscess formation, fistula formation, and 
suppuration).
RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were lost to follow-up (12%). Forty-five patients 
experienced prosthetic failure rendering a 94.3% survival rate. One hundred 
seventy-three implants failed in 98 patients, rendering an 83.5% (patient level) 
and 94.6% (implant level) cumulative survival rate. The average marginal bone 
levels were 1.18 mm, 1.56 mm, and 1.47 mm at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. 
Biological complications occurred in 86 patients (11.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Implant rehabilitations in patients presenting systemic disorders 
or smoking habits are possible with good outcomes. Nevertheless, different 
impacts on implant rehabilitations were registered according to the type of 
systemic disorder.

As value-based insurance design (VBID) programs proliferate, evidence is 
emerging on the impact of VBID. To date, studies have largely measured VBID 
impact on utilization, and a few studies have assessed its impact on quality, 
outcomes, and cost. In this commentary we discuss these domains, summarize 
evidence, and propose the extension of measurement of VBID impact into areas 
including workplace productivity and quality of life, employee and patient 
engagement, and talent attraction and retention. We contend that VBID 
evaluations should consider a broad variety of programmatic dividends on both 
humanistic and health-related outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Physical forces have been widely used to stimulate bone growth in 
fracture repair. Addition of bone growth stimulation to the conservative 
treatment regime is more costly than standard health care. However, it might 
lead to cost-savings due to a reduction of the total amount of working days 
lost. This economic evaluation was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF) compared to standard health care in the 
treatment of acute scaphoid fractures.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was carried out from a societal perspective, 
alongside a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial 
involving five centres in The Netherlands. One hundred and two patients with a 
clinically and radiographically proven fracture of the scaphoid were included in 
the study and randomly allocated to either active bone growth stimulation or 
standard health care, using a placebo. All costs (medical costs and costs due to 
productivity loss) were measured during one year follow up. Functional outcome 
and general health related quality of life were assessed by the EuroQol-5D and 
PRWHE (patient rated wrist and hand evaluation) questionnaires. Utility scores 
were derived from the EuroQol-5D.
RESULTS: The average total number of working days lost was lower in the active 
PEMF group (9.82 days) compared to the placebo group (12.91 days) (p = 0.651). 
Total medical costs of the intervention group (€1594) were significantly higher 
compared to the standard health care (€875). The total amount of mean QALY's 
(quality-adjusted life year) for the active PEMF group was 0.84 and 0.85 for the 
control group. The cost-effectiveness plane shows that the majority of all 
cost-effectiveness ratios fall into the quadrant where PEMF is not only less 
effective in terms of QALY's but also more costly.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the desired effects in terms of 
cost-effectiveness are not met. When comparing the effects of PEMF to standard 
health care in terms of QALY's, PEMF cannot be considered a cost-effective 
treatment for acute fractures of the scaphoid bone.

BACKGROUND: A usually confronted problem in association studies is the 
occurrence of population stratification. In this work, we propose a novel 
framework to consider population matchings in the contexts of genome-wide and 
sequencing association studies. We employ pairwise and groupwise optimal 
case-control matchings and present an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, 
both based on a genetic similarity score matrix. In order to ensure that the 
resulting matches obtained from the matching algorithm capture correctly the 
population structure, we propose and discuss two stratum validation methods. We 
also invent a decisive extension to the Cochran-Armitage Trend test to 
explicitly take into account the particular population structure.
RESULTS: We assess our framework by simulations of genotype data under the null 
hypothesis, to affirm that it correctly controls for the type-1 error rate. By a 
power study we evaluate that structured association testing using our framework 
displays reasonable power. We compare our result with those obtained from a 
logistic regression model with principal component covariates. Using the 
principal components approaches we also find a possible false-positive 
association to Alzheimer's disease, which is neither supported by our new 
methods, nor by the results of a most recent large meta analysis or by a mixed 
model approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Matching methods provide an alternative handling of confounding due 
to population stratification for statistical tests for which covariates are hard 
to model. As a benchmark, we show that our matching framework performs equally 
well to state of the art models on common variants.

OBJECTIVE: Most cancer patients experience the time when a doctor must "break 
the bad news" to them, a time when it is necessary for patients to call upon 
their self-determination to aid in the battle with cancer. The purpose of our 
study was to clarify the percentage of times doctors deliver bad news to 
patients at the end of life in each of four different situations, and to define 
the most common recipients of this bad news. We compare these results for two 
timepoints: 2006 and 2012.
METHODS: The study had a national cross-sectional design consisting of 
self-completed questionnaires sent to all hospitals that provide cancer care. We 
mailed them to hospital directors in January and February of 2012, requesting a 
reply. The results of the same survey in 2006 were employed as a point for 
comparison.
RESULTS: A total of 1224 questionnaires were returned during 2012. 1499 
responses collected in 2006 were employed as reference data. Some hospital 
characteristics had changed over that interval; however, the new data obtained 
were representative for patients being treated in Japanese cancer care 
hospitals. In hospitals with 300-499, there were significant differences between 
2006 and 2012 in the providing information about ("disclosure of cancer 
diagnosis," "therapeutic options for treatment," and "a life-prolonging 
treatment"). In addition, the likelihood of doctors delivering bad news to 
patients and family members (as opposed to family members only) at the end of 
life increased from 2006 to 2012.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Our results suggest that the overall incidence of bad 
news being disclosed has increased, especially in hub medical institutions for 
cancer care. Advanced treatment options or domestic legislation may have 
influenced the frequency or type of bad news.

OBJECTIVES: To improve individual health quality measures, which are associated 
with varying degrees of health benefit, and composite quality metrics, which 
weight individual measures identically.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed a health-weighted composite quality measure 
reflecting the total health benefit conferred by a health plan annually, using 
preventive care as a test case.
METHODS: Using national disease prevalence, we simulated a hypothetical 
insurance panel of individuals aged 25 to 84 years. For each individual, we 
estimated the gain in life expectancy associated with 1 year of health system 
exposure to encourage adherence to major preventive care guidelines, controlling 
for patient characteristics (age, race, gender, comorbidity) and variation in 
individual adherence rates. This personalized gain in life expectancy was used 
to proxy for the amount of health benefit conferred by a health plan annually to 
its members, and formed weights in our health-weighted composite quality 
measure. We aggregated health benefits across the health insurance membership 
panel to analyze total health system performance.
RESULTS: Our composite quality metric gave the highest weights to health plans 
that succeeded in implementing tobacco cessation and weight loss. One year of 
compliance with these goals was associated with 2 to 10 times as much health 
benefit as compliance with easier-to-follow preventive care services, such as 
mammography, aspirin, and antihypertensives. For example, for women aged 55 to 
64 years, successful interventions to encourage weight loss were associated with 
2.1 times the health benefit of blood pressure reduction and 3.9 times the 
health benefit of increasing adherence with screening mammography.
CONCLUSIONS: A single health-weighted quality metric may inform measurement of 
total health system performance.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in a 
nationwide representative sample of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The 
effects of drug-based therapy and risk factors for osteoporotic bone fractures 
on DALY losses were also explored.
METHODS: DALY were estimated based on participant's clinical characteristics and 
Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) data obtained from a cross-sectional, 
epidemiological one-visit study (the GINERISK study). The study enrolled 
postmenopausal women (at least 12-months after their last menstrual period) with 
osteoporosis, above 18-years old, who attended Spanish outpatient Gynaecology 
clinics. HRQoL was assessed using the generic SF-12v2 questionnaire, which was 
used to derive disutility values. Mortality rates were extracted from the 
Spanish national statistics database. Factors explored to be associated with 
DALY losses were examined using ANOVA, ANCOVA and MANCOVA models.
RESULTS: DALY could be computed in 2,782 (67%) out of 4,157 postmenopausal 
women, with a mean (95% CI) age of 61.0 (60.7-61.2) years. Overall individual 
undiscounted DALY per woman were 6.1 (5.9-6.2), resulting to be significantly 
higher in women with severe osteoporosis with prior bone fracture; 7.8 (7.2-8.4) 
compared to osteoporotic women [5.8 (5.6-6.0)] or postmenopausal women with a 
BMD > -2.5 T-score that received a drug-based therapy [6.2 (5.8-6.5)]; F = 27.0 
(P < 0.01). Models explaining the variation in the levels of health based on the 
use of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) or possession of risk 
factors for osteoporotic BF were found (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DALY losses were considerable amongst postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis. Not having a prior bone fracture, being older, using a SERM and 
having less osteoporotic risk factors were all linked to less DALY losses.

BACKGROUND: In the context of an epidemiologic transition in South Africa, in 
which cardiovascular disease is increasing, little is known about the stroke 
burden, particularly morbidity in rural populations. Risk factors for stroke are 
high, with hypertension prevalence of more than 50%. Accurate, up-to-date 
information on disease burden is essential in planning health services for 
stroke management. This study estimates the burden of stroke in rural South 
Africa using the epidemiological parameters of incidence, mortality and 
disability adjusted life year (DALY) metric, a time-based measure that 
incorporates both mortality and morbidity.
METHODS: Data from the Agincourt health and socio-demographic surveillance 
system was utilised to calculate stroke mortality for the period 2007-2011. 
Dismod, an incidence-prevalence-mortality model, was used to estimate incidence 
and duration of disability in Agincourt sub-district and 'mostly rural' 
municipalities of South Africa. Using these values, burden of disease in years 
of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) and DALYs was calculated 
for Agincourt sub-district.
RESULTS: Over 5 years, there were an estimated 842 incident cases of stroke in 
Agincourt sub-district, a crude stroke incidence rate of 244 per 100,000 person 
years. We estimate that 1,070 DALYs are lost due to stroke yearly. Of this, YLDs 
contributed 8.7% (3.5 - 10.5%) in sensitivity analysis). Crude stroke mortality 
was 114 per 100,000 person-years in 2007-11 in Agincourt sub-district. Burden of 
stroke in entire rural South Africa, a population of some 13,000,000 people, was 
high, with an estimated 33, 500 strokes occurring in 2011.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first estimates of stroke burden in terms 
of incidence, and disability in rural South Africa. High YLL and DALYs lost 
amongst the rural populations demand urgent measures for preventing and 
mitigating impacts of stroke. Longitudinal surveillance sites provide a platform 
through which a changing stroke burden can be monitored in rural South Africa.

OBJECTIVES: We estimated smoking-attributable mortality, assessed the impact of 
past smoking on recent mortality, and computed expected future losses in life 
expectancy caused by past and current smoking behavior in Latin America and the 
Caribbean.
METHODS: We used a regression-based procedure to estimate smoking-attributable 
mortality and information for 6 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, 
Mexico, and Uruguay) for the years 1980 through 2009 contained in the Latin 
American Mortality Database (LAMBdA). These countries jointly comprise more than 
two thirds of the adult population in Latin America and the Caribbean and have 
the region's highest rates of smoking prevalence.
RESULTS: During the last 10 years, the impact of smoking was equivalent to 
losses in male (aged ≥ 50 years) life expectancy of about 2 to 6 years. These 
effects are likely to increase, particularly for females, both in the study 
countries and in those that joined the epidemic at later dates.
CONCLUSIONS: Unless innovations in the detection and treatment of chronic 
diseases are introduced soon, continued gains in adult survival in Latin America 
and the Caribbean region may slow down considerably.

Neighborhoods affect health. In 3 adjoining inner-city Cleveland, Ohio, 
neighborhoods, residents have an average life expectancy 15 years less than that 
of a nearby suburb. To address this disparity, a local health funder created the 
2010 to 2013 Francis H. Beam Community Health Fellowship to develop a strategic 
community engagement process to establish a Healthy Eating & Active Living 
(HEAL) culture and lifestyle in the neighborhoods. The fellow developed and 
advanced a model, engaging the community in establishing HEAL options and 
culture. Residents used the model to identify a shared vision for HEAL and 
collaborated with community partners to create and sustain innovative HEAL 
opportunities. This community-led, collaborative model produced high engagement 
levels (15% of targeted 12 000 residents) and tangible improvements in the 
neighborhood's physical, resource, and social environments.

BACKGROUND: Specialized Early Intervention services (SEI) for first episode 
psychosis are shown to be effective for the treatment of positive and negative 
symptoms, medication adherence, rates of relapse, substance abuse disorders, 
functional outcome and quality of life at two-year treatment follow up. However, 
it is also reported that these benefits are not maintained when SEI is not 
sustained. The objective of this trial is to test the efficacy of a 3-year 
extension of a SEI service (following 2 years of SEI prior to randomization) for 
the maintenance and consolidation of therapeutic gains as compared to regular 
care in the community.
METHODS: Following an initial 2 years of SEI, patients are randomized to receive 
either 3-years of continued SEI or regular care. SEI provided at three sites 
within the McGill network of SEI services, using a model of treatment comprised 
of: modified assertive case management; psycho education for families; multiple 
family intervention; cognitive behavioural therapy; and substance abuse 
treatment and monitoring. Blinded research assistants conduct ongoing evaluation 
of the outcome variables every three months. The primary outcome measure is 
remission status measured both as the proportion of patients in complete 
remission and the mean length of remission achieved following randomization 
during the additional three years of follow up. Based on preliminary data, it is 
determined that a total of 212 patients are needed to achieve adequate 
statistical power. Intent to treat with the last observation carried forward 
will be the primary method of statistical analysis.
DISCUSSION: The "critical period" hypothesis posits that there is a five year 
window during which the effects of the nascent psychotic illness can be 
countered and the impact of the disorder on symptomatic and functional outcomes 
can be offset through active and sustained treatment. Providing SEI throughout 
this critical period may solidify the benefits of treatment such that gains may 
be more sustainable over time as compared to intervention delivered for a 
shorter period. Findings from this study will have implications for service 
provision in first episode psychosis.

BACKGROUND: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) incidence in Germany is low, 
but management of contacts to prevent subsequent cases still requires resources. 
Local public health authorities (LHA) advise antibiotic post-exposure 
prophylaxis (PEP) and vaccination to close contacts as defined in national 
guidance. We aimed to audit implementation of recommendations for IMD public 
health management in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, and to estimate 
associated costs.
METHODS: We surveyed all 38 LHAs in Baden-Wuerttemberg to evaluate knowledge of 
national guidance and implementation of IMD contact management using 
standardized questionnaires. For IMD cases notified in 2012, we requested 
numbers of household and other contacts ascertained, including advice given 
regarding PEP and post-exposure vaccination, plus staff time required for their 
management. We estimated costs for advised antibiotics, LHA staff time and 
visits to emergency departments according to published sources. The cost of 
preventing a subsequent case was estimated based on the number of household 
contacts that received PEP per IMD case and on the previous finding that ~284 
household contacts must receive PEP to prevent one subsequent IMD case.
RESULTS: Although LHAs were familiar with national recommendations, they did not 
advise PEP to 4% of household contacts, while 72% and 100% of school and health 
provider contacts, respectively, were advised PEP. Only 25% of household 
contacts of a case with a vaccine-preventable serogroup were advised 
post-exposure vaccination. A mean of 11.0 contacts/IMD case (range 0-51), of 
which 3.6 were household contacts, were recommended PEP. Per IMD case, mean 
costs for LHA staff were estimated at €440.86, for antibiotics at €219.14 and 
for emergency department visits to obtain PEP at €161.70 - a total of 
€821.17/IMD case. Preventing a subsequent IMD case would cost ~ €65,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insight into costs of IMD public health 
management in Germany. We identified marked underuse of post-exposure 
vaccination in household contacts and overuse of PEP in school and health care 
contacts. In view of an estimated 3-6 quality-adjusted life years lost per case 
of IMD, our estimated cost of €65,000 for preventing a subsequent case seems 
justifiable.

BACKGROUND: Retroperitoneal tumors (RTs) develop insidiously and are generally 
seen as large masses, and 50% of RTs are larger than 20 cm at the time of 
diagnosis. In this article, we share our experience of 5 years of surgical 
management of RTs.
METHODS: We evaluated 28 RT cases operated on in three education hospitals in 
Turkey from January 2008 onwards, with regard to patients' demographic 
characteristics, complaints, weight loss figures, the location and size of the 
tumor, blood transfusion, intra-operational time, metastases (in malignant 
cases), additional organ resection, histological grade, local recurrences, 
average life expectancy, and post-operative treatment methods.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 49 years (range, 18 to 78 years). 
Twenty (71.43%) were female, and 8 (28.57%) were male. The primary complaint was 
abdominal pain in 18 patients (64.28%). CT scans were performed in 17 (61%) 
patients, 10 (35.4%) underwent abdominal MR imaging, and 1 (3.6%) underwent both 
abdominal CT and abdominal MR imaging. A mass was palpated in the pelvis 
(suprapubic region) in seven (25%) of the patients during physical examination. 
The largest tumors were detected in the left lumbar area. The mean tumor size 
was 12.78 cm (range, 2 to 30 cm). The mean intra-operational time was 192 min 
(range, 70 to 380 min). The mean hospitalization period was 11 days (range, 8 to 
23 days). Seven (25%) patients were reported to have benign tumors, while 21 
(75%) were reported to have malignant tumors. The most frequently seen malignant 
pathology was liposarcoma (eight cases; 38.09%) followed by leiomyosarcoma (five 
cases; 23.8%) and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (four cases; 19.04%). The 
earliest local recurrence was detected in the 12th month and the latest in the 
28th month. A total of 11 (52.3%) of the total of 21 malignant cases experienced 
local recurrence within 3 years. The 3-year average life expectancy was 85.7% in 
the 18 malignant cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the low response rate of all but two types of RT to 
chemotherapy, the best remaining treatment option is surgery with wide resection 
margins, whereby all macroscopic traces of tumor are removed.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the time to benefit of using flexible sigmoidoscopy for 
colorectal cancer screening.
DESIGN: Survival meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review published in 2013, 
Medline, and Cochrane Library databases.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials comparing screening flexible 
sigmoidoscopy with no screening. Trials with fewer than 100 flexible 
sigmoidoscopy screenings were excluded.
RESULTS: Four studies were eligible (total n = 459,814). They were similar for 
patients' age (50-74 years), length of follow-up (11.2-11.9 years), and relative 
risk for colorectal cancer related mortality (0.69-0.78 with flexible 
sigmoidoscopy screening). For every 1000 people screened at five and 10 years, 
0.3 and 1.2 colorectal cancer related deaths, respectively, were prevented. It 
took 4.3 years (95% confidence interval 2.8 to 5.8) to observe an absolute risk 
reduction of 0.0002 (one colorectal cancer related death prevented for every 
5000 flexible sigmoidoscopy screenings). It took 9.4 years (7.6 to 11.3) to 
observe an absolute risk reduction of 0.001 (one colorectal cancer related death 
prevented for every 1000 flexible sigmoidoscopy screenings).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that screening flexible sigmoidoscopy is most 
appropriate for older adults with a life expectancy greater than approximately 
10 years.

Testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in HIV-infected persons in low 
tuberculosis (TB) incidence areas is often recommended. Using contemporary, 
clinical data, we report the yield and cost-effectiveness of testing all HIV 
attendees, two current UK strategies and no LTBI testing. Economic modelling was 
performed utilising 10-year follow up data from a large HIV clinical cohort. 
Outcomes were numbers of cases of active TB and incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Between 2000 and 2010, 256 people were 
treated for TB/HIV co-infection. 72 (28%) occurred ≥3 months after HIV diagnosis 
and may have been prevented by LTBI testing. Between 2000 and 2005, the 
incremental cost per QALY gained for the British HIV Association (BHIVA) and UK 
National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) strategies, and testing all clinic 
attendees was €6270, €6998 and €33,473, respectively. These rose to €9332, 
€32,564 and €74,067, respectively, between 2005 and 2010. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis suggested that at a threshold of €24,000 per additional 
QALY, the most cost-effective strategies would be NICE or testing all in 
2000-2005 and BHIVA during 2005-2010. Both UK testing regimens missed cases but 
are cost-effective compared with no testing. Using recent data, they all became 
more expensive, suggesting that alternative or more targeted TB testing 
strategies must be considered.

Many countries use the cost-effectiveness thresholds recommended by the World 
Health Organization's Choosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective project 
(WHO-CHOICE) when evaluating health interventions. This project sets the 
threshold for cost-effectiveness as the cost of the intervention per 
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted less than three times the country's 
annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Highly cost-effective 
interventions are defined as meeting a threshold per DALY averted of once the 
annual GDP per capita. We argue that reliance on these thresholds reduces the 
value of cost-effectiveness analyses and makes such analyses too blunt to be 
useful for most decision-making in the field of public health. Use of these 
thresholds has little theoretical justification, skirts the difficult but 
necessary ranking of the relative values of locally-applicable interventions and 
omits any consideration of what is truly affordable. The WHO-CHOICE thresholds 
set such a low bar for cost-effectiveness that very few interventions with 
evidence of efficacy can be ruled out. The thresholds have little value in 
assessing the trade-offs that decision-makers must confront. We present 
alternative approaches for applying cost-effectiveness criteria to choices in 
the allocation of health-care resources.

Publisher: De nombreux pays utilisent les seuils de rentabilité recommandés par 
le projet WHO-CHOICE (Choosing Interventions that are Cost–Effective; en 
français: « choisir des interventions efficaces au meilleur coût ») de 
l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé lors de l'évaluation des interventions 
sanitaires. Ce projet définit le seuil de rentabilité comme étant égal au coût 
de l'intervention par espérance de vie corrigée de l'incapacité (EVCI) évitée 
moins trois fois le produit intérieur brut (PIB) annuel du pays par habitant. 
Les interventions très rentables sont définies comme celles satisfaisant un 
seuil par EVCI évitée égal à une fois le PIB annuel par habitant. Nous soutenons 
que le recours à ces seuils réduit la valeur des analyses de rentabilité et 
qu'il rend ces analyses trop grossières pour qu'elles soient utiles pour la 
prise de décision dans le domaine de la santé publique. L'utilisation de ces 
seuils est peu justifiée théoriquement, contourne le classement difficile mais 
nécessaire des valeurs relatives des interventions applicables localement et 
néglige l'examen de ce qui vraiment abordable. Les seuils de WHO-CHOICE fixent 
une limite de rentabilité si basse que très peu d'interventions présentant des 
preuves d'efficacité peuvent être exclues. Les seuils ont peu de valeur pour 
évaluer les compromis auxquels les décideurs doivent faire face. Nous présentons 
des approches alternatives pour l'application des critères de rentabilité aux 
choix liés à l'allocation des ressources de soins de santé.

Publisher: Numerosos países utilizan los umbrales de rentabilidad recomendados 
por el proyecto Elección de intervenciones rentables de la Organización Mundial 
de la Salud – (WHO-CHOICE) al evaluar las intervenciones de salud. Este proyecto 
establece el umbral de rentabilidad como el coste de la intervención por año de 
vida ajustado por discapacidad (AVAD) evitado, que es tres veces inferior al 
producto interno bruto anual del país (PIB) per cápita. Las intervenciones de 
rentabilidad elevada se definen como el cumplimiento de un umbral por AVAD 
evitado equivalente a una vez el PIB per cápita anual. Se arguye que la 
dependencia de estos umbrales reduce el valor de los análisis de rentabilidad y 
hace que dichos análisis sean demasiado contundentes para que resulten útiles en 
la mayoría de las decisiones en el campo de la salud pública. El uso de estos 
umbrales tiene una justificación teórica insuficiente, elude la clasificación 
difícil pero necesaria de los valores relativos de las intervenciones aplicables 
a nivel local y omite cualquier consideración de lo que es realmente asequible. 
Los umbrales de WHO-CHOICE establecen un límite de rentabilidad tan bajo que son 
muy pocas las intervenciones de eficacia probada que pueden descartarse. Los 
umbrales tienen poco valor a la hora de evaluar las ventajas y desventajas a las 
que los responsables de la toma de decisiones deben enfrentarse. Presentamos 
enfoques alternativos para la aplicación de los criterios de rentabilidad en las 
decisiones acerca de la asignación de los recursos de salud.

Publisher: تستخدم العديد من البلدان عتبات المردودية التي أوصى بها مشروع "اختيار 
التدخلات عالية المردود التابع لمنظمة الصحة العالمية" (WHO-CHOICE) عند تقدير 
التدخلات في مجال الصحة. ويحدد هذا المشروع عتبة المردودية على أنها تكلفة التدخل 
لكل سنة تم تفاديها من سنوات العمر المصححة باحتساب مدد العجز الأقل من ثلاث أضعاف 
الناتج الإجمالي المحلي السنوي للبلد لكل فرد. ويتم تعريف التدخلات عالية المردود 
على أنها تلبية العتبة لكل سنة تم تفاديها من سنوات العمر المصححة باحتساب مدد 
العجز لمرة واحدة من الناتج الإجمالي المحلي السنوي لكل فرد. ونرى أن الاعتماد على 
هذه العتبات يقلل من قيمة تحليلات المردودية ويجعل مثل هذه التحليلات عديمة الفائدة 
في معظم حالات اتخاذ القرار في مجال الصحة العمومية. ويستند استخدام هذه العتبات 
إلى مبرر نظري ضعيف ويتجنب الترتيب الصعب والضروري للقيم النسبية للتدخلات السارية 
على الصعيد المحلي ويغفل النظر عن النهج معقولة التكلفة بالفعل. وتحدد عتبات 
WHO-CHOICE عتبة دنيا للمردودية يمكن على أساسها استبعاد بضعة تدخلات ذات بيِّنات 
على الكفاءة. وتكون للعتبات قيمة قليلة في تقييم عمليات الموازنة التي يتعين على 
متخذي القرار مواجهتها. ونقدم نهجاً بديلة لتطبيق معايير المردودية على الاختيارات

许多国家在评估卫生干预措施时使用世界卫生组织WHO-CHOICE（选择具有成本效益的干预措施项目）推荐的成本效益阈值。该项目将成本效益阈值设定为避免单位残疾调整生命年（DALY）的干预措施的成本低于国家年度人均国内生产总值（GDP）三倍。将极具成本效益的干预措施定义为达到以单倍年度人均国内生产总值避免的单位DALY的成本的阈值。我们主张，对这些阈值的依赖减少了成本效益分析的价值，使这种分析太过生硬，以致于对大多数公共卫生领域的决策来说用处不大。使用这些阈值几乎没有理论依据，绕开了做起来很难但又不得不去做的对当地适用干预措施相对价值排名，忽略了对任何有关什么才真正实惠的考虑。WHO-CHOICE阈值为成本效益设定的门槛这样低，以至于为数不多具有效力证据的干预措施也会被排除在外。阈值在评估决策者必须面对的权衡上价值微乎其微。我们提出了医疗资源分配方面的选择上成本效益标准应用的替代方法。.

Publisher: Во многих странах используются пороговые значения эффективности 
затрат, рекомендованные рабочей программой ВОЗ «Выбор мероприятий, эффективных с 
точки зрения затрат» (WHO-CHOICE), при оценке проводимых мероприятий в области 
здравоохранения. Этот проект устанавливает пороговое значение эффективности 
затрат как стоимость мероприятия на количество предотвращенных лет жизни, 
утраченных в результате инвалидности (ДАЛИ), не превышающая три годовых валовых 
внутренних продукта (ВВП) страны на душу населения. При этом высокоэффективными 
мероприятиями считаются те, которые соответствуют пороговому значению на 
предотвращенное ДАЛИ в размере, не превышающем одного годового ВВП на душу 
населения. Мы утверждаем, что использование этих пороговых значений снижает 
стоимость анализа эффективности затрат и делает подобный анализ поверхностным 
для большинства случаев принятия решений в области общественного 
здравоохранения. Для использования этих пороговых значений не имеется 
достаточных теоретических обоснований, они упускают из виду трудоемкое, но 
необходимое ранжирование относительной стоимости применяемых локально 
мероприятий, а также не рассматривают доступность подобных мероприятий. 
Программой WHO-CHOICE устанавливается такая низкая планка для эффективности 
затрат, что лишь немногие мероприятия с признаками эффективности могут быть 
исключены. Эти пороговые значения не имеют большой ценности в процессе принятия 
компромиссных решений, с которыми приходится иметь дело отвественным лицам. Мы 
предлагаем альтернативные подходы для применения критериев эффективности затрат 
при выборе предпочтительных вариантов в процессе распределения ресурсов 
здравоохранения.
