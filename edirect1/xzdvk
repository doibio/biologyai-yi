estimated disease burden was 30,180 DALYs (95% UI 30,126; 30,242), corresponding 
to 520 DALYs/100,000. The disease burden was higher in the age groups above 
70 years of age, particularly in men. Years of life lost (YLL) contributed with 
more than 99% of total DALYs. The results of the scenario analysis showed that 
defining COVID-19-related fatalities as deaths registered up to 30 days after 
the first positive test led to a lower YLL estimate than when using a 60-days 
window.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 led to a substantial public health impact in Denmark in the 
first full year of the epidemic. Our estimates suggest that it was the the sixth 
most frequent cause of YLL in Denmark in 2020. This impact will be higher when 
including the post-acute consequences of COVID-19 and indirect health outcomes.

This study assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of thiamine (TA) in 
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and also assessed the preservative 
properties of TA in minced beef. TA demonstrated a concentration-dependent 
antimicrobial effect on microbial contaminants. Inhibition zones and MIC from 
the effect of TA on the tested bacterial strains were respectively within the 
ranges 15−20 mm and 62.5−700 µg/mL. TA significantly (p < 0.05) decreased all 
the pro-inflammatory factors [(nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 
TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)] monitored relative to 
LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. TA inhibited the expression of both iNOS and 
COX-2. In minced beef flesh, the growth of Listeria monocytogenes was inhibited 
by TA. TA improved physicochemical and microbiological parameters of stored 
minced beef meat compared to control. Principal component analyses and heat maps 
elucidate the quality of the tested meats.

BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has transformed HIV 
infection from a terminal disease to a manageable chronic health condition, 
extending patients' life expectancy to that of the general population. However, 
the incidence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) has persisted 
despite virological suppression. Patients with HIV display persistent signs of 
immune activation and inflammation despite cART. The arachidonic acid (AA) 
cascade is an important immune response system responsible for both pro- and 
anti-inflammatory processes.
METHODS: Lipidomics, mRNA and Western blotting analysis provide valuable 
insights into the molecular mechanisms surrounding arachidonic acid metabolism 
and the resulting inflammation caused by perturbations thereof.
RESULTS: Here, we report the presence of inflammatory eicosanoids in the brains 
of a transgenic mouse model of NeuroHIV that expresses soluble HIV-1 envelope 
glycoprotein in glial cells (HIVgp120tg mice). Additionally, we report that the 
effect of LTC4S knockout in HIVgp120tg mice resulted in the sexually dimorphic 
transcription of COX- and 5-LOX-related genes. Furthermore, the absence of LTC4S 
suppressed ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling activity in female mice only. The mass 
spectrometry-based lipidomic profiling of these mice reveals beneficial 
alterations to lipids in the brain.
CONCLUSION: Targeting the AA cascade may hold potential in the treatment of 
neuroinflammation observed in NeuroHIV and HANDs.

The improvement in life expectancy, economic conditions, and technological and 
medical progress have radically changed the demographic structure of many 
societies. Since many countries now have an ageing population, by adopting a 
life-course study perspective, this paper aims to explore the needs of older 
adults (over 60), and the currently adult population which will become older in 
the coming decades (50-60 years). In detail, the study investigates the 
lifestyles of the target populations by focusing on two main areas concerning 
health (healthy diet; attitudes towards physical activity) and 
socio-relational-housing and living conditions (social housing, senior 
co-housing in rural environments, etc.). A qualitative study was carried out 
based on 16 in-depth interviews developed over one month (February 2022). The 
conduct of the interviews was supported by the Italian Center for Sensory 
Analysis (CIAS). Emerging from the results, the concept of active ageing is 
perceived by mature and older adults in a positive and optimistic way. The 
sample considered want to re-engage in life, continuing to be active, useful, 
and maintaining their self-esteem, social life and independence. However, 
despite older people's major concerns being preserve their physical abilities 
and social integration, this target group adopts behaviours focused more on 
current well-being rather than worrying too much about how this well-being will 
change as they age.

End-of-life care and the limitation of therapeutic effort are among the most 
controversial aspects of medical practice. Many subjective factors can influence 
decision-making regarding these issues. The Q methodology provides a scientific 
basis for the systematic study of subjectivity by identifying different thought 
patterns. This methodology was performed to find student profiles in 143 
students at Cantabria University (Spain), who will soon deal with difficult 
situations related to this topic. A chi-square test was used to compare 
proportions. We obtained three profiles: the first seeks to ensure quality of 
life and attaches great importance to the patient's wishes; the second 
prioritizes life extension above anything else; the third incorporates the 
economic perspective into medical decision-making. Those who had religious 
beliefs were mostly included in profile 2 (48.8% vs. 7.3% in profile 1 and 43.9% 
in profile 3), and those who considered that their beliefs did not influence 
their ethical principles, were mainly included in profile 3 (48.5% vs. 24.7% in 
profile 1 and 26.8% in profile 2). The different profiles on end-of-life care 
amongst medical students are influenced by personal factors. Increasing the 
clinical experience of students with terminally ill patients would contribute to 
the development of knowledge-based opinion profiles and would avoid reliance on 
personal experiences.

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is one of the most important causes of 
vascular dementia. Immunosenescence and inflammatory response, with the 
involvement of the cerebrovascular system, constitute the basis of this disease. 
Immunosenescence identifies a condition of deterioration of the immune organs 
and consequent dysregulation of the immune response caused by cellular 
senescence, which exposes older adults to a greater vulnerability. A low-grade 
chronic inflammation status also accompanies it without overt infections, an 
"inflammaging" condition. The correlation between immunosenescence and 
inflammaging is fundamental in understanding the pathogenesis of age-related 
CSVD (ArCSVD). The production of inflammatory mediators caused by inflammaging 
promotes cellular senescence and the decrease of the adaptive immune response. 
Vice versa, the depletion of the adaptive immune mechanisms favours the 
stimulation of the innate immune system and the production of inflammatory 
mediators leading to inflammaging. Furthermore, endothelial dysfunction, chronic 
inflammation promoted by senescent innate immune cells, oxidative stress and 
impairment of microglia functions constitute, therefore, the framework within 
which small vessel disease develops: it is a concatenation of molecular events 
that promotes the decline of the central nervous system and cognitive functions 
slowly and progressively. Because the causative molecular mechanisms have not 
yet been fully elucidated, the road of scientific research is stretched in this 
direction, seeking to discover other aberrant processes and ensure therapeutic 
tools able to enhance the life expectancy of people affected by ArCSVD. Although 
the concept of CSVD is broader, this manuscript focuses on describing the 
neurobiological basis and immune system alterations behind cerebral aging. 
Furthermore, the purpose of our work is to detect patients with CSVD at an early 
stage, through the evaluation of precocious MRI changes and serum markers of 
inflammation, to treat untimely risk factors that influence the burden and the 
worsening of the cerebral disease.

Interest in palliative care has increased in recent times, particularly in its 
multidisciplinary approach developed to meet the needs of patients with a 
life-threatening disease and their families. Although the modern concept of 
palliative simultaneous care postulates the adoption of these qualitative 
treatments early on during the life-threatening disease (and potentially just 
after the diagnosis), palliative care is still reserved for patients at the end 
of their life in most of the clinical realities, and thus is consequently 
mistaken for hospice care. Patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
usually experience poor quality of life and decreased survival expectancy and 
thus may benefit from palliative care. Palliative care requires close 
collaboration among multiple health care providers, patients, and their families 
to share the diagnosis, prognosis, realistic treatment goals, and treatment 
decisions. Several approaches, such as conservative management, extracorporeal, 
and peritoneal palliative dialysis, can be attempted to globally meet the needs 
of patients with kidney disease (e.g., physical, social, psychological, or 
spiritual needs). Particularly for frail patients, pharmacologic management or 
peritoneal dialysis may be more appropriate than extracorporeal treatment. 
Extracorporeal dialysis treatment may be disproportionate in these patients and 
associated with a high burden of symptoms correlated with this invasive 
procedure. For those patients undergoing extracorporeal dialysis, individualized 
goal setting and a broader concept of adequacy should be considered as the 
foundations of extracorporeal palliative dialysis. Interestingly, little 
evidence is available on palliative and end of life care for acute kidney injury 
(AKI) patients. In this review, the main variables influencing medical 
decision-making about palliative care in patients with kidney disease are 
described, as well as the different approaches that can fulfill the needs of 
patients with CKD and AKI.

BACKGROUND: Statistical data on the prevalence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of protein-energy malnutrition are 
valuable for health resource planning and policy-making. We aimed to estimate 
protein-energy malnutrition burdens worldwide according to gender, age, and 
sociodemographic index (SDI) between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: Detailed data on protein-energy malnutrition from 1990 to 2019 was 
extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database. The global 
prevalence, deaths, and DALYs attributable to protein-energy malnutrition and 
the corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs) were analyzed.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition increased 
to 14,767,275 cases. The age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) showed an 
increasing trend between 1990 and 2019, while the age-standardized deaths rate 
(ASDR) and age-standardized DALYs rate presented a significantly decreasing 
trend in the same period. Meanwhile, there was a clearly ASPR, ASDR, and 
age-standardized DALYs rate downtrend of the prediction curve when the SDI went 
up.
CONCLUSIONS: PEM still has a relatively serious disease burden in the world, 
especially in children and the elderly. At the same time, this phenomenon will 
be more obvious due to the aging of the world's population. Effective prevention 
measures should be strengthened to continuously improve public health 
conditions.

Under-five years of age is a critical period for children's growth and 
development. Nutritional deficiency during this period is associated with 
wasting, underweight and stunting. We aimed to conduct an epidemiological study 
using data derived from the GBD2019 to found the global distribution and 
changing trends of nutritional deficiencies among children under 5 years old, as 
well as the correlation between social development status and nutritional 
deficiencies. Nutritional deficiencies in children under 5 years has been 
substantially improved in the past decade; however, the progress has been 
unevenly distributed globally. The incidence and DALY rate decreased with the 
increase of socio-demographic index. In 2019, the incidence (51,872.0 per 
100,000) was highest in Central Sub-Saharan Africa and the DALY rate (5597.1 per 
100,000) was the highest in Western Sub-Saharan Africa. Among five subcategories 
of nutritional deficiencies in children under 5 years, vitamin A deficiency 
accounted for the largest proportion of incident cases (100,511,850, 62.1% in 
2019), while the proportion of DALYs caused by protein-energy malnutrition was 
the highest (9,925,276, 62.0%). Nutritional deficiency in some countries remains 
worrisome, for whom policies guarantees and sustained efforts to control 
nutritional deficiencies are urgently needed.

Background: Bony deformities and arthropathies have been noticed in thalassemia 
patients. The aim of this study is to compare the arc of motion and radiological 
parameters of the wrist and patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) between adult 
transfusion-dependent thalassemics and normal subjects. Methods: An 
observational cross-sectional study was done in the department of orthopaedics 
over a period of 2 years where a total of 30 skeletally mature thalassemia major 
patients (group A) were assessed. The data was then compared with the data of 
demographically matched 30 healthy adults (group B). Arc of motion of the 
dominant wrist that included flexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation, 
pronation and supination was measured using a handheld goniometer for both 
groups. Radiographs of the dominant wrist were obtained in both groups and used 
to determine the radial height, radial articular angle and carpal slip. PRWE was 
used to assess the function of the wrist. A p-value of <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Results: Clinical abnormalities at the wrist joint 
were found in 80% of thalassaemia patients. There was a statistically 
significant increase in ulnar deviation, wrist extension and decrease in wrist 
flexion in group A compared to group B. Radiological abnormalities were found in 
100% of thalassaemia patients. All the radiological parameters were 
significantly increased in group A compared to group B. There were no 
differences in PRWE scores between both groups. Conclusion: Clinical and 
radiological changes of wrist joint occur in skeletally mature thalassaemia 
major patients due to shortened ulna compared to healthy adults. This may be due 
to disease itself, bone marrow expansion, osteopenia, drug (chelating agent) or 
iron toxicity. Understanding the changes at the wrist in patients with 
thalassemia major is important to increasing the life expectancy of these 
patients. Level of Evidence: Level IV (Diagnostic).

BACKGROUND: Varroa control is essential for the maintenance of healthy honey bee 
colonies. Overuse of acaricides has led to the evolution of resistance to those 
substances. Studies of the short-term acaricidal effects and safety of various 
lithium (Li) salts recently have been reported. This study examined the 
long-term in vitro and in vivo bee toxicities, short-term motor toxicity to bees 
and long-term anti-Varroa field efficacy of several Li salts.
RESULTS: In an in vitro chronic-toxicity assay, lithium citrate (18.8 mm) was 
the most toxic of the examined salts, followed by lithium lactate (29.5 mm), and 
lithium formate (32.5 mm). In terms of acute locomotor toxicity to bees, all of 
the Li salts were well-tolerated and none of the treatment groups differed from 
the negative control group. In an in vitro survival study, all of the Li 
treatments significantly reduced bee life spans by a factor of 1.8-7.2, as 
compared to the control. In terms of life expectancy, lithium citrate was the 
most toxic salt, with no significant differences noted between lithium formate 
and lithium lactate. In the bee-mortality field study, none of the examined 
treatments differed from the negative control. Amitraz and lithium formate 
exhibited similar acaricide effects, which were significantly different from 
those observed for lithium lactate and the negative control.
CONCLUSION: In light of lithium formate's honey bee safety and efficacy as an 
acaricide, additional sublethal toxicity studies in brood, drones and queens, as 
well as tests aimed at the optimization of administration frequency are 
warranted. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) involve multiple organs including the heart 
and vasculature. Despite novel treatments, patients with ARDs still experience a 
reduced life expectancy, partly caused by the higher prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). This includes CV inflammation, rhythm 
disturbances, perfusion abnormalities (ischaemia/infarction), dysregulation of 
vasoreactivity, myocardial fibrosis, coagulation abnormalities, pulmonary 
hypertension, valvular disease, and side-effects of immunomodulatory therapy. 
Currently, the evaluation of CV involvement in patients with ARDs is based on 
the assessment of cardiac symptoms, coupled with electrocardiography, blood 
testing, and echocardiography. However, CVD may not become overt until late in 
the course of the disease, thus potentially limiting the therapeutic window for 
intervention. More recently, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has allowed 
for the early identification of pathophysiologic structural/functional 
alterations that take place before the onset of clinically overt CVD. CMR allows 
for detailed evaluation of biventricular function together with tissue 
characterization of vessels/myocardium in the same examination, yielding a 
reliable assessment of disease activity that might not be mirrored by blood 
biomarkers and other imaging modalities. Therefore, CMR provides diagnostic 
information that enables timely clinical decision-making and facilitates the 
tailoring of treatment to individual patients. Here we review the role of CMR in 
the early and accurate diagnosis of CVD in patients with ARDs compared with 
other non-invasive imaging modalities. Furthermore, we present a consensus-based 
decision algorithm for when a CMR study could be considered in patients with 
ARDs, together with a standardized study protocol. Lastly, we discuss the 
clinical implications of findings from a CMR examination.

AIMS: We analyzed whether the frequency of adding salt to foods was associated 
with the hazard of premature mortality and life expectancy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 501 379 participants from UK biobank who 
completed the questionnaire on the frequency of adding salt to foods at 
baseline. The information on the frequency of adding salt to foods (do not 
include salt used in cooking) was collected through a touch-screen questionnaire 
at baseline. We found graded relationships between higher frequency of adding 
salt to foods and higher concentrations of spot urinary sodium or estimated 24-h 
sodium excretion. During a median of 9.0 years of follow-up, 18 474 premature 
deaths were documented. The multivariable hazard ratios [95% confidence interval 
(CI)] of all-cause premature mortality across the increasing frequency of adding 
salt to foods were 1.00 (reference), 1.02 (0.99, 1.06), 1.07 (1.02, 1.11), and 
1.28 (1.20, 1.35) (P-trend < 0.001). We found that intakes of fruits and 
vegetables significantly modified the associations between the frequency of 
adding salt to foods and all-cause premature mortality, which were more 
pronounced in participants with low intakes than those with high intakes of 
these foods (P-interaction = 0.02). In addition, compared with the never/rarely 
group, always adding salt to foods was related to 1.50 (95% CI, 0.72-2.30) and 
2.28 (95% CI, 1.66-2.90) years lower life expectancy at the age of 50 years in 
women and men, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that higher frequency of adding salt to foods 
is associated with a higher hazard of all-cause premature mortality and lower 
life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Experimental and epidemiological studies indicate an association 
between exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution and increased risk of 
type 2 diabetes. In view of the high and increasing prevalence of diabetes, we 
aimed to quantify the burden of type 2 diabetes attributable to PM2·5 
originating from ambient and household air pollution.
METHODS: We systematically compiled all relevant cohort and case-control studies 
assessing the effect of exposure to household and ambient fine particulate 
matter (PM2·5) air pollution on type 2 diabetes incidence and mortality. We 
derived an exposure-response curve from the extracted relative risk estimates 
using the MR-BRT (meta-regression-Bayesian, regularised, trimmed) tool. The 
estimated curve was linked to ambient and household PM2·5 exposures from the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019, and estimates 
of the attributable burden (population attributable fractions and rates per 
100 000 population of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years) for 204 
countries from 1990 to 2019 were calculated. We also assessed the role of 
changes in exposure, population size, age, and type 2 diabetes incidence in the 
observed trend in PM2·5-attributable type 2 diabetes burden. All estimates are 
presented with 95% uncertainty intervals.
FINDINGS: In 2019, approximately a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes 
was attributable to PM2·5 exposure, with an estimated 3·78 (95% uncertainty 
interval 2·68-4·83) deaths per 100 000 population and 167 (117-223) 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 000 population. Approximately 
13·4% (9·49-17·5) of deaths and 13·6% (9·73-17·9) of DALYs due to type 2 
diabetes were contributed by ambient PM2·5, and 6·50% (4·22-9·53) of deaths and 
5·92% (3·81-8·64) of DALYs by household air pollution. High burdens, in terms of 
numbers as well as rates, were estimated in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South 
America. Since 1990, the attributable burden has increased by 50%, driven 
largely by population growth and ageing. Globally, the impact of reductions in 
household air pollution was largely offset by increased ambient PM2·5.
INTERPRETATION: Air pollution is a major risk factor for diabetes. We estimated 
that about a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes is attributable PM2·5 
pollution. Air pollution mitigation therefore might have an essential role in 
reducing the global disease burden resulting from type 2 diabetes.

Circular economy (CE) is claimed to be a promising pathway to achieve the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but a reliable metric is needed to 
validate closed-loop strategies by measuring sustainability performances 
together with the degree of circularity. A significant contribution is offered 
by Life Cycle (LC) scholars in terms of methodological advances and operational 
tools for different sectors, also those more complex such as the agro-industrial 
systems that encompass biological and anthropogenic variables at different 
scales. However, to date, LC methodologies have not yet answered how to model 
the complexity of circular pathways. LC evaluations are often modelled for 
cradle-to-grave analyses, while a circularity evaluation would require an 
extension of the system boundaries to more interconnected life cycles, orienting 
towards a cradle-to-cradle perspective. This research gap led us to propose a 
multi-cycle approach with expanded assessment boundaries, including co-products, 
into a cradle-to-cradle perspective, in an attempt to internalize circularity 
impacts. The customized LC framework here proposed is based on the Life Cycle 
Assessment (LCA), the Environmental Life Cycle Costing (ELCC) in terms of 
internal and external costs, and the Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) in 
terms of Psychosocial Risk Factor (PRF) impact pathway. The model is designed to 
be applied to the olive-oil sector, which commonly causes significant impacts by 
generating many by-products whose management is often problematic. Results are 
expected to show that the customized LC framework proposed can better highlight 
the environmental and socioeconomic performances of the system of cycles, 
allowing CE to deliver its promises of sustainability, as the circularity of 
materials per se is a means, not an end in itself.

Cities are sometimes characterized as homogenous with species assemblages 
composed of abundant, generalist species having similar ecological functions. 
Under this assumption, rare species, or species observed infrequently, would 
have especially high conservation value in cities for their potential to 
increase functional diversity. Management to increase the number of rare species 
in cities could be an important conservation strategy in a rapidly urbanizing 
world. However, most studies of species rarity define rarity in relatively 
pristine environments where human management and disturbance is minimized. We 
know little about what species are rare, how many species are rare, and what 
management practices promote rare species in urban environments. Here, we 
identified which plants and species of birds and bees that control pests and 
pollinate crops are rare in urban gardens and assessed how social, biophysical 
factors, and cross-taxonomic comparisons influence rare species richness. We 
found overwhelming numbers of rare species, with more than 50% of plants 
observed classified as rare. Our results highlight the importance of women, 
older individuals, and gardeners who live closer to garden sites in increasing 
the number of rare plants within urban areas. Fewer rare plants were found in 
older gardens and gardens with more bare soil. There were more rare bird species 
in larger gardens and more rare bee species for which canopy cover was higher. 
We also found that in some cases, rarity begets rarity, with positive 
correlations found between the number of rare plants and bee species and between 
bee and bird species. Overall, our results suggest that urban gardens include a 
high number of species existing at low frequency and that social and biophysical 
factors promoting rare, planned biodiversity can cascade down to promote rare, 
associated biodiversity.
