INTRODUCTION: Results-based financing (RBF) is being promoted to increase 
coverage and quality of maternal and perinatal healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa 
(SSA) countries. Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of RBF is limited. We 
assessed the cost-effectiveness within the context of an RBF intervention, 
including performance-based financing and conditional cash transfers, in rural 
Malawi.
METHODS: We used a decision tree model to estimate expected costs and effects of 
RBF compared with status quo care during single pregnancy episodes. RBF effects 
on maternal case fatality rates were modelled based on data from a maternal and 
perinatal programme evaluation in Zambia and Uganda. We obtained complementary 
epidemiological information from the published literature. Service utilisation 
rates for normal and complicated deliveries and associated costs of care were 
based on the RBF intervention in Malawi. Costs were estimated from a societal 
perspective. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per disability 
adjusted life year (DALY) averted, death averted and life-year gained (LYG) and 
conducted sensitivity analyses to how robust results were to variations in key 
model parameters.
RESULTS: Relative to status quo, RBF implied incremental costs of US$1122, 
US$26 220 and US$987 per additional DALY averted, death averted and LYG, 
respectively. The share of non-RBF facilities that provide quality care, life 
expectancy of mothers at time of delivery and the share of births in non-RBF 
facilities strongly influenced cost-effectiveness values. At a willingness to 
pay of US$1485 (3 times Malawi gross domestic product per capita) per DALY 
averted, RBF has a 77% probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: At high thresholds of wiliness-to-pay, RBF is a cost-effective 
intervention to improve quality of maternal and perinatal healthcare and 
outcomes, compared with the non-RBF based approach. More RBF cost-effectiveness 
analyses are needed in the SSA region to complement the few published studies 
and narrow the uncertainties surrounding cost-effectiveness estimates.

Within the mitotic spindle, kinesin motors cross-link and slide overlapping 
microtubules. Some of these motors exhibit off-axis power strokes, but their 
impact on motility and force generation in microtubule overlaps has not been 
investigated. Here, we develop and utilize a three-dimensional in vitro motility 
assay to explore kinesin-14, Ncd, driven sliding of cross-linked microtubules. 
We observe that free microtubules, sliding on suspended microtubules, not only 
rotate around their own axis but also move around the suspended microtubules 
with right-handed helical trajectories. Importantly, the associated torque is 
large enough to cause microtubule twisting and coiling. Further, our technique 
allows us to measure the in situ spatial extension of the motors between 
cross-linked microtubules to be about 20 nm. We argue that the capability of 
microtubule-crosslinking kinesins to cause helical motion of overlapping 
microtubules around each other allows for flexible filament organization, 
roadblock circumvention and torque generation in the mitotic spindle.

INTRODUCTION: Etrolizumab is a next-generation anti-integrin with dual action 
that targets two pathways of inflammation in the gut. A robust phase 3 clinical 
program in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease is ongoing and will 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrolizumab in well-defined patient 
populations in rigorous trials that include direct head-to-head comparisons 
against approved anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (anti-TNF). The 
etrolizumab phase 3 clinical program consists of six randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs; UC: HIBISCUS I and II, GARDENIA, LAUREL, HICKORY; Crohn's disease: 
BERGAMOT) and two open-label extension trials (OLEs; UC: COTTONWOOD; Crohn's 
disease: JUNIPER) evaluating patients with moderately to severely active UC or 
Crohn's disease.
METHODS: In the UC RCTs, patients are randomly assigned according to each 
protocol to receive etrolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab, or placebo. In 
BERGAMOT, patients are randomly assigned to receive etrolizumab 105 mg, 
etrolizumab 210 mg, or placebo. The primary outcomes for the UC RCTs are Mayo 
Clinic score-based clinical response, remission, and clinical remission; for 
BERGAMOT, the co-primary outcomes are clinical remission (based on abdominal 
pain and stool frequency) and endoscopic improvement (based on the Simple 
Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease). The OLEs will primarily assess long-term 
efficacy and safety. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include endoscopy, 
histology, quality of life, and biomarkers at various timepoints.
DISCUSSION: The etrolizumab phase 3 clinical program is the largest and most 
comprehensive in inflammatory bowel disease, enrolling more than 3000 patients. 
The program explores both induction and maintenance regimens. HIBISCUS I and II 
and GARDENIA are among the first head-to-head trials in UC against an anti-TNF 
and are the first registrational trials making that comparison. This program 
will also help address unanswered clinical questions on evaluation of treatment 
effects and treatment selection across a range of patients with varying 
treatment histories using an extensive repository of patient samples and data.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: HIBISCUS I (NCT02163759), HIBISCUS II 
(NCT02171429), GARDENIA (NCT02136069), LAUREL (NCT02165215), HICKORY 
(NCT02100696), COTTONWOOD (NCT02118584), BERGAMOT (NCT02394028), JUNIPER 
(NCT02403323).

OBJECTIVES: The US has among the world's strictest automobile emission 
standards, but it is now loosening them. It is unclear where a nation should 
draw the line between the associated cost burden imposed by regulations and the 
broader societal benefits associated with having cleaner air. Our study examines 
the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of introducing stricter vehicle 
emission standards in France and Italy.
STUDY DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study.
METHODS: We used cost-effectiveness modeling to measure the incremental 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost (Euros) of adopting more stringent 
US vehicle emission standards for PM2.5 in France and Italy.
RESULTS: Adopting Obama era US vehicle emission standards would likely save 
money and lives for both the French and Italian populations. In France, adopting 
US emission standards would save €1000 and increase QALYs by 0.04 per capita. In 
Italy, the stricter standards would save €3000 and increase QALYs by 0.31. The 
results remain robust in both the sensitivity analysis and probabilistic Monte 
Carlo simulation model.
CONCLUSIONS: Adopting more stringent emission standards in France and Italy 
would save money and lives.

The huge resources that had gone into Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
research led to the development of potent antivirals able to suppress viral load 
in the majority of treated patients, thus dramatically increasing the life 
expectancy of people living with HIV. However, life-long treatments could result 
in the emergence of drug-resistant viruses that can progressively reduce the 
number of therapeutic options, facilitating the progression of the disease. In 
this scenario, we previously demonstrated that inhibitors of the human DDX3X 
helicase can represent an innovative approach for the simultaneous treatment of 
HIV and other viral infections such as Hepatitis c virus (HCV). We reported 
herein 6b, a novel DDX3X inhibitor that thanks to its distinct target of action 
is effective against HIV-1 strains resistant to currently approved drugs. Its 
improved in vitro ADME properties allowed us to perform preliminary in vivo 
studies in mice, which highlighted optimal biocompatibility and an improved 
bioavailability. These results represent a significant advancement in the 
development of DDX3X inhibitors as a novel class of broad spectrum and safe 
anti-HIV-1 drugs.

China had made dramatic health gains before its economic reform that began in 
1978 produced rapid economic growth in the ensuing years. Since the economic 
reform, China's income inequality has substantially increased, and health gains 
have stagnated. This article investigates the extent to which China's health 
stagnation may be attributable to the rise in income inequality in China. By 
simulating the improvement in life expectancy that could have resulted if, 
ceteris paribus, income inequality had stayed constant at the lowest level after 
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, we find that the sharply 
increasing income inequality in China has contributed to life loss in China's 
population, about 0.6 years for men and 0.4 years for women. These findings 
suggest that redistribution of income from rich to poor may be one of the most 
important policy levers for improving population health in China.

Effects of vehicle safety design on road traffic deaths, injuries, and public 
health burden in the Latin American region: a modelling study.

BACKGROUND: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to halve global 
traffic deaths by 2020, will not be met by most low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs). In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, traffic 
deaths have remained stable at a high-level despite strong progress in other 
health domains. We evaluated the effects of road safety interventions in LAC and 
estimated the benefits that vehicle design improvements would have in this 
region.
METHODS: In our study done in October, 2018, we used a counterfactual analysis 
to assess the reduction in deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
lost if eight proven vehicle safety technologies were made more widely available 
in LAC countries. We estimated: (1) country-level incidence of traffic injuries, 
(2) the effectiveness of technologies through a systematic literature review, 
(3) the prevalence of car safety technologies, and (4) the lives saved and DALYs 
averted if all cars had these technologies. We characterised uncertainty in 
estimates by reporting the sensitivity of the results to alternative modelling 
assumptions.
FINDINGS: Increasing availability of electronic stability control, which 
includes antilock-brake systems, would have the largest benefits in the LAC 
region, estimated at 19·4% (sensitivity analysis range 8·6-31·1) fewer deaths 
and 17·0% (5·7-29·2) fewer DALYs. Increasing use of seatbelts would reduce 
deaths by 12·1% (9·1-15·5) and DALYs by 12·6% (9·4-16·3). Optimisation for 
side-impacts would result in 6·3% (3·1-6·5) fewer deaths, and improvements to 
vehicle front-end design would result in 6·0% (2·2-10·4) fewer deaths. The 
overall effect of improved vehicle design in the region would be 28·1% 
(12·8-39·2) fewer deaths, and 29·1% (13·5-39·8) fewer DALYs. Other safety 
technologies modelled, including airbag (front and side), side door beam, and 
side structure and padding, have smaller benefits.
INTERPRETATION: Regulating and encouraging the use of proven vehicle safety 
technologies in LMICs would have large gains and needs to be prioritised in the 
SDG agenda for 2030.

PURPOSE: To determine whether a machine learning approach optimizes survival 
estimation for patients with symptomatic bone metastases (SBM), we developed the 
Bone Metastases Ensemble Trees for Survival (BMETS) to predict survival using 27 
prognostic covariates. To establish its relative clinical utility, we compared 
BMETS with 2 simpler Cox regression models used in this setting.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 492 bone sites in 397 patients evaluated for 
palliative radiation therapy (RT) for SBM from January 2007 to January 2013, 
data for 27 clinical variables were collected. These covariates and the primary 
outcome of time from consultation to death were used to build BMETS using random 
survival forests. We then performed Cox regressions as per 2 validated models: 
Chow's 3-item (C-3) and Westhoff's 2-item (W-2) tools. Model performance was 
assessed using cross-validation procedures and measured by time-dependent area 
under the curve (tAUC) for all 3 models. For temporal validation, a separate 
data set comprised of 104 bone sites treated in 85 patients in 2018 was used to 
estimate tAUC from BMETS.
RESULTS: Median survival was 6.4 months. Variable importance was greatest for 
performance status, blood cell counts, recent systemic therapy type, and receipt 
of concurrent nonbone palliative RT. tAUC at 3, 6, and 12 months was 0.83, 0.81, 
and 0.81, respectively, suggesting excellent discrimination of BMETS across 
postconsultation time points. BMETS outperformed simpler models at each time, 
with respective tAUC at each time of 0.78, 0.76, and 0.74 for the C-3 model and 
0.80, 0.78, and 0.77 for the W-2 model. For the temporal validation set, 
respective tAUC was similarly high at 0.86, 0.82, and 0.78.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with SBM, BMETS improved survival predictions versus 
simpler traditional models. Model performance was maintained when applied to a 
temporal validation set. To facilitate clinical use, we developed a web platform 
for data entry and display of BMETS-predicted survival probabilities.

BACKGROUND: Increasing costs put the value of spine surgery under scrutiny. In 
health economics, cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) are used to compare the 
value of competing procedures. However, inconsistent methodology prevents 
standardization and implementation of recommendations. The goal of this study is 
to perform a systematic review of all U.S. CEAs in spine surgery reported to 
date, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and define metrics essential for 
high-quality CEAs.
METHODS: We followed AMSTAR systematic review methods, identifying all U.S. 
spine surgery CEAs reported to March 2019 with a structured, reproducible search 
of PubMed, Embase, and the Tufts CEA Registry.
RESULTS: We identified 40 CEA studies. Twelve (30%) used outcome data from a 
randomized controlled trial. To calculate costs, 22 (55%) used allowed charges 
but costing methods were often unclear or imprecise. Studies applying 
discounting had mean follow-up of 5.92 years compared with 3.00 years for 
studies without. Eleven of 15 (73%) cervical studies compared cervical disc 
arthroplasty with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, finding cervical disc 
arthroplasty to be cost-effective (<$100,000/quality-adjusted life year) for 
1-level and 2-level procedures. Eleven of 25 lumbar studies (44%) compared 
operative with nonoperative interventions for intervertebral disc herniation, 
lumbar stenosis, and lumbar spondylolisthesis. Lumbar studies comparing surgical 
with nonoperative intervention found surgery at least cost-effective for 
intervertebral disc herniation and lumbar stenosis, but cost-effective only for 
lumbar spondylolisthesis at 4 years follow-up. Most studies (70%) lacked 
appropriate sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Costing methodology remains obscure and inconsistent and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results incomparable. The language of 
costing methodology must be standardized and sensitivity analyses of outcome and 
cost inputs mandatory for publication.

BACKGROUND: Long-term survival of hip implants is of increasing relevance due to 
the rising life expectancy. The biomechanical effect of strain shielding as a 
result of implant insertion may lead to bone resorption, thus increasing risk 
for implant loosening and periprosthetic fractures. Patient-specific 
quantification of strain shielding could assist orthopedic surgeons in choosing 
the biomechanically most appropriate prosthesis.
METHODS: Validated quantitative CT-based finite element models of five femurs in 
intact and implanted states were considered to propose a systematic algorithm 
for strain shielding quantification. Three different strain measures were 
investigated and the most appropriate measure for strain shielding 
quantification is recommended. It is used to demonstrate a practical 
femur-specific implant selection among three common designs.
FINDINGS: Strain shielding measures demonstrated similar trends in all Gruen 
zones except zone 1, where the volumetric strain measure differed from von-Mises 
and maximum principal strains. The volumetric strain measure is in better 
agreement with clinical bone resorption records. It is also consistent with the 
biological mechanism of bone remodeling so it is recommended for strain 
shielding quantification. Applying the strain shielding algorithm on three 
different implants for a specific femur suggests that the collared design is 
preferable. Such quantitative biomechanical input is valuable for practical 
patient specific implant selection.
INTERPRETATION: Volumetric strain should be considered for strain shielding 
examination. The presented methodology may potentially enable patient-specific 
pre-operative strain shielding evaluation so to minimize strain shielding. It 
should be further used in a longitudinal study so to correlate between strain 
shielding predictions and clinical bone resorption.

Objectives Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the availability 
and quality of both therapeutic and diagnostic methods, the Belgian authorities 
have decided to launch a procedure for additional evaluation of the performance 
of serological tests offered for sale on the national territory. This has been 
proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and 
clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale 
in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests 
subject to evaluation. Methods A retrospective validation study was conducted 
including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and 
clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first 
commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and 
IgG. Results The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the 
acceptance criteria and provided "real world" analytical and clinical 
performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert 
kit. Comparison between the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 and the ELISA method did not 
reveal any difference between the two techniques in terms of sensitivities and 
specificities regarding the determination of the IgG. Conclusions This study 
reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG 
antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical 
performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important 
rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.

BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a common, serious illness in the elderly, with a poorly 
characterized long-term impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The 
Japanese Goto Epidemiology Study is a prospective, active, population-based 
surveillance study of adults with X-ray/CT scan-confirmed community-onset 
pneumonia, assessing the HRQoL outcome quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We 
report QALY scores and losses among a subset of participants in this study.
METHODS: QALYs were derived from responses to the Japanese version of the 
EuroQol-5D-5L health-state classification instrument at days 0, 7, 15, 30, 90, 
180, and 365 after pneumonia diagnosis from participants enrolled from June 2017 
to May 2018. We used patients as their own controls, calculating comparison 
QALYs by extrapolating EuroQol-5D-5L scores for day -30, accounting for 
mortality and changes in scores with age.
RESULTS: Of 405 participants, 85% were aged ≥65 years, 58% were male, and 69% 
were hospitalized for clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. 
Compliance with interviews by patients or proxies was 100%. Adjusted 
EuroQol-5D-5L scores were 0.759, 0.561, 0.702, and 0.689 at days -30, 0 
(diagnosis), 180, and 365, respectively. Average scores at all time points 
remained below the average day -30 scores (P ≤ .001). Pneumonia resulted in a 
1-year adjusted loss of 0.13 QALYs (~47.5 quality-adjusted days) (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial QALY losses were observed among Japanese adults 
following pneumonia diagnosis, and scores had not returned to prediagnosis 
levels at 1 year postdiagnosis. QALY scores and cumulative losses were 
comparable to those in US adults with chronic heart failure, stroke, or renal 
failure.

Liver-directed therapy should be considered for patients with unresectable liver 
metastases from neuroendocrine tumor if symptomatic or progressing despite 
medical management. Our experience and current literature shows that the bland 
embolization, chemoembolization, and radioembolization are very effective in 
controlling symptoms and disease burden in the liver, and that these 
embolization modalities are similar in terms of efficacy and radiologic 
response. Their safety profiles differ, however, with recent studies suggesting 
an increase in biliary toxicity with drug-eluting bead chemoembolization over 
conventional chemoembolization, and a risk of long-term hepatotoxicity with 
radioembolization. For this reason, we tailor the type of embolotherapy to each 
patient according to their clinical status, symptoms, degree of tumor burden, 
histologic grade, and life expectancy. We do not recommend a "one-size-fits-all" 
approach. Our general strategy is to use bland embolization as first-line 
embolotherapy, and radioembolization for patients with high-grade tumors or who 
have failed other embolotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: Poorer mental health in adulthood is associated with increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease and reduced life expectancy. However, little is known 
of the molecular pathways underpinning this relationship and how early in life 
adverse metabolite profiles relate to self-reported variation in mental health. 
We examined cross-sectional associations between mental health and serum 
metabolites indicative of cardiovascular health, in large Australian 
population-based cohorts at two stages of the life-course.
METHODS: We characterised cross-sectional serum nuclear magnetic resonance 
metabolite profiles of positively and negatively framed mental health in a large 
population-based sample of Australian 11- to 12-year-olds (n = 1172; 51% girls) 
and mid-life adults (n = 1322; mean age 45 years; 87% women). We examined 
multiple standard self-report mental health scales, spanning psychosocial 
health, general well-being, life satisfaction, and health-related quality of 
life. Linear regression was used to investigate the cross-sectional association 
between mental health and each metabolite (n = 73) in children and adults 
separately, unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and 
body mass index.
RESULTS: Better child and adult mental health were associated with lower levels 
of the inflammatory marker glycoprotein acetyls, and a favourable, less 
atherogenic lipid/lipoprotein profile. Patterns of association in children were 
generally weaker than in adults. Associations were generally modest and 
partially attenuated when adjusted for body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, metabolite profiles associated with better child and 
adult mental health closely aligned with those predictive of better 
cardiovascular health in adults. Our findings support previous evidence for the 
likely bidirectional relationship between mental health and cardiovascular 
disease risk, by extending this evidence base to the molecular level and in 
children.

PURPOSE: The loss of muscle functions is a significant health issue among 
dialysis patients. Poor muscle strength negatively affects a patient's mobility, 
independence and quality of life. The aim of the study was to assess the effects 
of an intradialytic resistance training (IRT) on lower extremity muscle 
functions among dialysed patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety patients were allocated into an experimental group 
(n = 57) or control group (CNG) (n = 33) according to the location of the 
dialysis service center. Fifty-eight patients completed the study follow-up. The 
intervention regarded 12-week IRT, while the controls remained physically 
inactive during hemodialysis. In both groups of patients, we assessed lower 
extremity muscle functions by a diagnostics of maximal isometric force generated 
during hip flexion (HF), hip extension (HE), and knee extension (KE) 
contractions at baseline, after the 12-weeks intervention and after a further 
12-weeks follow up.
RESULTS: We found that improvements in HE between baseline and post-intervention 
were significantly larger for the experimental than the CNG (difference 32.0, 
95% CI = 12.3-51.8, p = 0.002). For the other primary outcomes, we found no 
differences between the groups, and neither for the two other indices of muscle 
strength (HF and KE). At 12-weeks follow-up, we found no statistically 
significant differences between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that exercise during dialysis not just 
suppresses adverse effects in muscle strength and functioning, but effectively 
and safely increases lower extremities muscle function in a relatively short 
time.Implications for RehabilitationRegular, progressive, resistance training 
realized during dialysis is well tolerated and safe for exercise interventions 
in hemodialysis patients.A 12-weeks intradialytic resistance training is 
effective in the prevention and clinical management of muscle function loss 
among hemodialysis patients.The range of improvements in muscle functions, 
demonstrated by the assessment of maximal isometric force, varied severely 
during different lower extremity movements of hemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Efforts to enhance professional quality of life (ProQOL) may prove a 
promising area for intervention to reducing workforce jettison and maintaining a 
healthy and resilient workforce necessary for supporting children and families 
in the child welfare system.
OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to describe the relative contributions of 
measures of ProQOL to intent on leaving the workforce among child welfare 
professionals. We also aimed to describe gender differences in ProQOL, intent to 
leave, and associated correlations among child welfare professionals. Such an 
investigation is a critical extension of earlier efforts as women constitute a 
markedly larger proportion of the workforce compared to men and evidence exists 
pointing to gender disparities in helping professionals' work experiences.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Secondary data were used from a survey of child 
welfare professionals across five sites.
METHODS: Univariate and bivariate statistics, hierarchical linear regression, 
and associated z-scores and p-values were used to meet the aforementioned aims.
RESULTS: Burnout accounted for the greatest variation in intent to leave among 
all professionals. However, gender disparities were found for all ProQOL 
measures with the largest difference observed for burnout, an effect more 
pronounced in males. Compassion satisfaction was significantly higher among 
females.
CONCLUSIONS: Burnout shapes intentions to leave for child welfare professionals; 
however, the effects of emotional exhaustion and hopelessness are stronger 
predictors of turnover among male than females in the current sample. 
Organizational strategies to reduce burnout and future research directions are 
discussed.

A decrease in mobility, related to illness, trauma or ageing, negatively affects 
the quality of life of the rapidly growing elderly population. A promising 
solution to maintain this standard of living is powered wearable mobility assist 
devices. Although they have achieved technological breakthroughs in the last 
decade, their overall success is still hindered by their induced physical 
discomfort, which limits their effective and prolonged usage. The aim of this 
study is to achieve a comprehensive characterization of human-machine physical 
interface to further advance the performance of wearable mobility assist 
devices, specifically for the knee joint. This led the research group to design, 
fabricate, and instrument a low-cost modular knee orthosis testing apparatus 
with extension moment assist that allows multiple physical interface adjustment 
parameters. This device was conceived with the objective to conduct human 
testing while introducing design variables and operating parameters to evaluate 
device's performance. Using a force mapping apparatus and a motion capture 
system, the kinetic and the kinematic behaviour of the developed orthosis' 
physical interfaces were acquired. The results demonstrated varied impact on 
performance when introducing key design variables namely interface position, 
interface geometry, interface compliancy, interface hard-shell position, 
interface degree of freedom, and knee extension moment. This study provides an 
in-depth understanding of distinct user-device interface mechanisms and 
permitted an evaluation of optimum orthosis parameters to help further advance 
the state of wearable mobility assist devices.

The rate of in-stent restenosis (ISR) has become increasingly prevalent with the 
exponential growth in stent implantation due to an aging population and a higher 
life expectancy, in addition to the high rates of obesity and diabetes. In this 
prospective, single operator, all-comer study, we sought to analyze the 
performance of ELCA followed by bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) placement 
in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ISR. A total 
of 13 patients had ISR treated with a combination of ELCA and BVS, with 9 
patients having matched OCT pre, post ELCA and post BVS. Mean age was 65 ± 11.22 
and 83% of the patients were male. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were present in 
100% of the patients and smoking and diabetes in 50%. After the procedure, we 
did not detect residual stenosis over 10% in any patient, resulting in a 
technical success of 100%. No patients had MACE during their hospital stay or 
within the next six months, resulting in a procedure success of 100%. The mean 
lumen area increased 0.35 mm2 from pre procedure to post ELCA and 3.58 mm2 from 
post ELCA to post BVS. The final difference, from pre procedure to post BVS, was 
a 3.93 mm2 lumen area gain. The mean lumen diameter increased 0.11 mm from 
baseline to ELCA, 0.95 mm from post laser to BVS implantation and 1.06 mm from 
pre procedure to post BVS. The NIH area reduced 0.48 mm2 from pre to post ELCA, 
1.13mm2 from post ELCA to BVS implantation and 1.61 mm2 from baseline to post 
BVS implantation. We conclude that ELCA is a safe and feasible debulking method 
to approach ISR, with high rates of post-procedural BVS success, within six 
months follow-up.

AIM: To evaluate the U.S. population-level impact of two alternatives for 
initial type 2 diabetes screening [opportunistic random plasma glucose (RPG) > 
6.7 mmol/l and a 1-h 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT) > 8.9 mmol/l] compared 
with American Diabetes Association (ADA)-recommended tests.
METHODS: Using a sample (n = 1471) from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 that represented 145 million U.S. adults 
at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes, we simulated a two-test screening 
process. We compared ADA-recommended screening tests [fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG), 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c ] vs. initial 
screening with opportunistic RPG or GCT (followed by FPG, OGTT or HbA1c ). After 
simulation, participants were entered into an individual-level Monte Carlo-based 
Markov lifetime outcomes model. Primary outcomes were representative number of 
U.S. adults correctly identified with type 2 diabetes, societal lifetime costs 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: In NHANES 2013-2014, 100 individuals had undiagnosed diabetes [weighted 
estimate: 8.4 million, standard error (se): 1.1 million]. Among ADA-recommended 
screening tests, FPG followed by OGTT (FPG-OGTT) was most sensitive, identifying 
35 individuals with undiagnosed diabetes (weighted estimate: 3.2 million, se: 
0.9 million). Four alternative screening strategies performed superior to 
FPG-OGTT, with RPG followed by OGTT being the most sensitive overall, 
identifying 72 individuals with undiagnosed diabetes (weighted estimate: 6.1 
million, se: 1.0 million). There was no increase in average lifetime costs and 
comparable QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial screening using opportunistic RPG or a GCT may identify 
more U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes without increasing societal costs.
