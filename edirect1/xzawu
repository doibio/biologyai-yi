developed unacceptable dairy flavours. In contrast, cuts packaged in foil 
laminate developed floras of lactobacilli that had not caused spoilage after 12 
weeks, and meat colour was much improved by the exclusion of oxygen. Loin cuts 
from a commercial packaging operation were packaged in a shrinkable plastic film 
of low oxygen permeability (30 to 40 cc/m(2)/24 h at 25°C and 90% relative 
humidity), in foil laminate, or in foil laminate after the addition of 5% lactic 
acid solution. For the first 6 weeks, cuts were stored in a commercial chiller 
nominally operating at 0°C; subsequently, they were held in a laboratory chiller 
at -0.5°C. Some cuts packaged in the shrinkable plastic were spoiled after 9 
weeks' storage and all were spoiled at 12 weeks, because of off-flavours 
produced by enterobacteria. All cuts packaged in the foil laminate were very 
acceptable at 9 weeks but most were spoiled by off-flavours at 12 weeks. Most 
cuts treated with lactic acid and packaged in foil laminate were unspoiled after 
12 weeks. The packaging requirements indicated to be necessary for reliable 
extension of the storage life of vacuum packaged lamb are discussed.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is most 
prevalent among adults born from 1945 through 1965, and approximately 50% to 75% 
of infected adults are unaware of their infection.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of birth-cohort screening.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness simulation.
DATA SOURCES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, U.S. Census, 
Medicare reimbursement schedule, and published sources.
TARGET POPULATION: Adults born from 1945 through 1965 with 1 or more visits to a 
primary care provider annually.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal, health care.
INTERVENTION: One-time antibody test of 1945-1965 birth cohort.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of cases that were identified and treated and that 
achieved a sustained viral response; liver disease and death from HCV; medical 
and productivity costs; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with the status quo, birth-cohort 
screening identified 808,580 additional cases of chronic HCV infection at a 
screening cost of $2874 per case identified. Assuming that birth-cohort 
screening was followed by pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN+R) for 
treated patients, screening increased QALYs by 348,800 and costs by $5.5 
billion, for an ICER of $15,700 per QALY gained. Assuming that birth-cohort 
screening was followed by direct-acting antiviral plus PEG-IFN+R treatment for 
treated patients, screening increased QALYs by 532,200 and costs by $19.0 
billion, for an ICER of $35,700 per QALY saved.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER of birth-cohort screening was most 
sensitive to sustained viral response of antiviral therapy, the cost of therapy, 
the discount rate, and the QALY losses assigned to disease states.
LIMITATION: Empirical data on screening and direct-acting antiviral treatment in 
real-world clinical settings are scarce.
CONCLUSION: Birth-cohort screening for HCV in primary care settings was 
cost-effective.

Transitioning from inpatient to outpatient therapy in patients with in-hospital 
hyperglycemia.

Peterson G(1).

Author information:

Transition from inpatient to outpatient care for patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus is an important aspect of patient management for which there is no 
guidance. Intensive glucose lowering with insulin is generally favored for 
seriously ill hospitalized patients, but after discharge, patients often resume 
their prior regimens, which may include an array of oral or injected 
glucose-lowering agents. Factors that should be considered in this transition 
include goals of care/life expectancy, glycated hemoglobin at hospital 
admission, home medications for other illnesses and their potential for 
interactions with antidiabetes treatment, comorbidities, nutritional status, 
physical disabilities, ability to carry out self-monitoring of blood glucose, 
risk for hypoglycemia, contraindications to oral medications, health literacy, 
and financial and other resources. Traditional oral therapies that may be used 
after the patient leaves the hospital include sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase 
inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and metformin. α-Glucosidase inhibitors are 
limited by gastrointestinal adverse events, and thiazolidinediones by fluid 
retention and increased risk for heart failure. Thiazolidinediones also require 
a long period of administration for onset glucose lowering and are not suitable 
for transitioning hospitalized patients who have been receiving insulin to 
outpatient care. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal, cardiac, 
or pulmonary insufficiency. Incretin-based therapies, glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, have limited use in 
hospitals, but may be suitable for the transition to outpatient treatment. The 
most common adverse events with glucagon-like peptide-1 inhibitors involve the 
gastrointestinal system. More formal studies of treatment regimens for patients 
with hyperglycemia leaving the hospital are needed to guide care for this group.

The impact of using different tariffs to value EQ-5D health state descriptions: 
an example from a study of acute cough/lower respiratory tract infections in 
seven countries.

of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK. r.a.oppong@bham.ac.uk

When using the EQ-5D in European cross-national studies, there is no consensus 
over whether the European value set (EVS), country specific value sets (CVS) or 
UK value set (UKVS) should be used. Data on health outcomes were collected in 7 
countries. EQ-5D index scores were generated for each country using all three 
value sets. QALYs gained over 4 weeks based on EQ-5D scores were also generated 
in order to investigate the implications for cost-utility analysis. EQ-5D scores 
obtained using the EVS were similar to values obtained using the CVS and UKVS in 
all countries. CVS-based EQ-5D scores were on average associated with a smaller 
baseline-to-week 4 change/improvement in all countries (except in Wales and 
Belgium) while UKVS-based EQ-5D scores showed the largest improvement over the 
same period for every country. With regards to cost-utility analysis, the 
results suggest that in most countries (with the exception of Belgium and 
Finland), using different tariffs to value EQ-5D would not have made a 
difference to the decisions based on the results of cost-utility analysis.

Application of ultra high pressure (UHP) in starch chemistry.

Kim HS(1), Kim BY, Baik MY.

Author information:
(1)Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, Andong National University, 
Korea.

Ultra high pressure (UHP) processing is an attractive non-thermal technique for 
food treatment and preservation at room temperature, with the potential to 
achieve interesting functional effects. The majority of UHP process applications 
in food systems have focused on shelf-life extension associated with non-thermal 
sterilization and a reduction or increase in enzymatic activity. Only a few 
studies have investigated modifications of structural characteristics and/or 
protein functionalities. Despite the rapid expansion of UHP applications in food 
systems, limited information is available on the effects of UHP on the 
structural and physicochemical properties of starch and/or its chemical 
derivatives included in most processed foods as major ingredients or minor 
additives. Starch and its chemical derivatives are responsible for textural and 
physical properties of food systems, impacting their end-use quality and/or 
shelf-life. This article reviews UHP processes for native (unmodified) starch 
granules and their effects on the physicochemical properties of UHP-treated 
starch. Furthermore, functional roles of UHP in acid-hydrolysis, 
hydroxypropylation, acetylation, and cross-linking reactions of starch granules, 
as well as the physicochemical properties of UHP-assisted starch chemical 
derivatives, are discussed.

Delay to celiac disease diagnosis and its implications for health-related 
quality of life.

Health, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. fredrik.norstrom@epiph.umu.se

BACKGROUND: To determine how the delay in diagnosing celiac disease (CD) has 
developed during recent decades and how this affects the burden of disease in 
terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and also to consider 
differences with respect to sex and age.
METHODS: In collaboration with the Swedish Society for Coeliacs, a questionnaire 
was sent to 1,560 randomly selected members, divided in equal-sized age- and sex 
strata, and 1,031 (66%) responded. HRQoL was measured with the EQ-5D descriptive 
system and was then translated to quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scores. A 
general population survey was used as comparison.
RESULTS: The mean delay to diagnosis from the first symptoms was 9.7 years, and 
from the first doctor visit it was 5.8 years. The delay has been reduced over 
time for some age groups, but is still quite long. The mean QALY score during 
the year prior to initiated treatment was 0.66; it improved after diagnosis and 
treatment to 0.86, and was then better than that of a general population (0.79).
CONCLUSIONS: The delay from first symptoms to CD diagnosis is unacceptably long 
for many persons. Untreated CD results in poor HRQoL, which improves to the 
level of the general population if diagnosed and treated. By shortening the 
diagnostic delay it is possible to reduce this unnecessary burden of disease. 
Increased awareness of CD as a common health problem is needed, and active case 
finding should be intensified. Mass screening for CD might be an option in the 
future.

College, Parel, Mumbai 12, India.

Sheep/goat forequarters procured from freshly slaughtered animals were 
decontaminated with hot water and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, 
Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The 
forequarters were individually spray washed with 2% lactic acid and 1.5% acetic 
+ 1.5% propionic acid combination. Total viable count (TVC) of the treated meat 
samples was reduced by about 0.52 and 1.16 log units with marginal changes in 
colour and odour scores. Inoculated organisms were found to be highly sensitive 
to acid combination treatment as compared to lactic acid alone. Shelf-life of 
acid and acid combination treated samples was increased to 8 and 11 days as 
against 3 days in untreated samples. Carcass washing with acid alone or acid 
combination was found to be suitable for extension of shelf-life and improvement 
in the sensory and microbiological quality of meat.

43100 Parma, Italy.

Antimicrobial packaging, an active packaging concept, can be considered an 
extremely challenging technology that could have a significant impact on 
shelf-life extension and food safety of meat and meat products. Use of 
antimicrobial substances can control the microbial population and target 
specific microorganisms to provide higher safety and quality products. Many 
classes of antimicrobial compounds have been evaluated in film structures, both 
synthetic polymers and edible films: organic acids and their salts, enzymes, 
bacteriocins, and miscellaneous compounds such as triclosan, silver zeolites, 
and fungicides. The characteristics of some antimicrobial packaging systems are 
reviewed in this article. The regulatory status of antimicrobial packaging in EU 
is also examined.

Prion diseases are neurodegenerative conditions caused by misfolding of a normal 
host-encoded prion protein (PrPC) into pathogenic scrapie prion protein (PrPSc). 
In human prion diseases, the M129V prion protein polymorphism is known to confer 
susceptibility to the disease, determines PrPSc conformation and alters 
clinicopathological phenotypes. To date, all clinicopathologically confirmed 
cases of a variant form of Cruetzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) have been 129MM 
homozygotes. There is also predominance of 129MM homozygotes in sporadic CJD 
(sCJD). No information regarding prion disorders is available from Pakistan. 
Although only invasive procedures like brain biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of 
prion disorders, testing a corresponding human population for variation in the 
prion protein gene (PRNP) may provide some insights into the presence of these 
disorders in a locality. The current study therefore aimed at exploring the 
genetic susceptibility of Pakistani population to CJD. A total of 909 unrelated 
individuals including 221 hemophiliacs representing all 4 major provinces of 
Pakistan were screened for M129V polymorphism and insertions or deletions of 
octapeptide repeats (OPRIs/OPRDs) using Polymerase Chain Reaction coupled with 
Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Concordance of the results 
of some PCR-RFLP reactions was also confirmed by dideoxy automated Sanger 
sequencing. The frequencies of M129V alleles (129M and 129V) and genotypes 
(129MM, 129MV and 129VV) were found in all 909 individuals to be 0.7101, 0.2899, 
0.5270, 0.3663 and 0.1067, respectively. Deletion of 1 octapeptide repeat 
(1-OPRD) was detected in heterozygous state in PRNP of 10 individuals and in 
homozygous state in 1 individual. An insertion of 3 octapeptide repeats (3-OPRI) 
was found in 1 individual and an insertion of 1 octapeptide repeat (1-OPRI) in 
two individuals. Both 3-OPRI and 1-OPRI were present in heterozygous state and 
were linked to 129M allele. There were no significant χ2 differences between 
M129V allelic and genotypic frequencies of healthy individuals and hemophiliacs. 
However, M129V allelic and genotypic frequencies differed significantly between 
Pakistani population and East Asian and Western populations. Non-significant χ2 
differences between M129V frequencies of healthy individuals and hemophiliacs 
suggest that individuals manifesting single gene disorders may provide naturally 
randomized samples for studies aiming at surveying the genetic variation. The 
combined excess of 129MM and 129VV homozygosity and the presence of 3-OPRI in 1 
individual imply that Pakistani population is susceptible to prion disorders. 
Cases of prion disorders may exist in Pakistan, albeit at lower annual 
prevalence than other countries where life expectancy is greater than 65 years.

Effect of radiation processing on the shelf-life and safety of some ethnic 
Indian meat products like chicken chilly, mutton shammi kababs and pork salami 
during chilled storage was investigated. Radiation processing resulted in dose 
dependent reduction in microbial counts. A dose of 3 kGy was found to be optimal 
for the shelf-life extension. In all the three irradiated (3 kGy) meat products 
the shelf-life was extended by more than 2 weeks at 0-3 °C compared to the 
corresponding non-irradiated samples. Staphylococcus spp. were completely 
eliminated by irradiation at a dose of 2 kGy. Some increase in lipid 
peroxidation on irradiation was observed as measured by TBA assay but it did not 
affect the sensory attributes of the product.

A combination of low O(2), high CO(2) and very low CO was investigated for 
packaging fresh beef steaks and ground meat. The following atmospheres were 
used: 70% O(2) + 20% CO(2) + 10% N(2) (CMA); 70% O(2) + 20% CO(2) + 9% N(2) + 1% 
CO (HOCO) and 24% O(2) + 50% CO(2) + 25% N(2) + 1% CO (LOCO). Bacterial counts 
showed that LOCO atmosphere greatly reduced psychrotrophic population, so that 
log cfu cm(-2) was under 7.5 at 29 days of storage at 1 °C. All the objective 
measurements related to meat colour (a(∗), hue, Chroma and metmyoglobin 
concentration) revealed that the bright-red colour was more stable in both HOCO 
and LOCO atmospheres, reaching 29 days of storage without appreciable signs of 
oxidation. Sensory analysis confirmed these results.

Fresh beef steaks, either sprayed on the surface with a solution of rosemary and 
vitamin C or not sprayed, were packaged in 70%O(2+)20%CO(2+)10%N(2) and 
displayed at 1±1 °C without illumination or illuminated by a standard 
fluorescent lamp, a low-UV, colour-balanced lamp (Promolux®), or the fluorescent 
lamp with a UV filter. Metmyoglobin formation, lipid oxidation (2-thiobarbituric 
acid reactive substances), instrumental colour (CIE L*, a*, b*), psychrotrophic 
bacterial counts (PCA) and sensory discolouration and off-odour were determined. 
Results showed that the use of the antioxidant mixture of rosemary and vitamin C 
together with the absence of UV radiation significantly reduced the rates of 
metmyoglobin formation and lipid oxidation, as well as microbial growth, and 
extended the display life from about 10 to about 20 days.

Fresh lamb steaks were treated with three different preparations of natural 
antioxidants: one group was packaged with a rosemary active film, the second 
group was packaged with an oregano active film, and the third group was sprayed 
on the meat surface with a rosemary extract before packaging in a high-oxygen 
atmosphere. Samples were stored under illumination at 1±1°C for 13days. 
Metmyoglobin formation, lipid oxidation (TBARS), instrumental colour (CIE a(∗)), 
psychrotrophic bacterial counts (PCA), sensory discolouration and off-odour were 
determined. The use of a rosemary extract, a rosemary active film or an oregano 
active film resulted in enhanced oxidative stability of lamb steaks. Active 
films with oregano were significantly more efficient than those with rosemary, 
exerting an effect similar to that of direct addition of the rosemary extract; 
in fact, they extended fresh odour and colour from 8 to 13days compared to the 
control.

Life expectancy in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is shortened due to 
spontaneous rupture of arteries, the colon and the gravid uterus. Two adolescent 
males with vascular EDS illustrate rapid progression of arterial aneurysms, 
dissections, and rupture. Radiologic imaging played an important role in 
initially diagnosing and monitoring the evolution of arterial involvement. Both 
prophylactic and emergency management remain largely ineffective in this 
connective tissue disorder; however, noninvasive imaging may provide important 
prognostic information.

This study was meant to analyse the relationship between vital statistics and 
life expectancy as measure of population control and welfare of citizenry in 
African countries and lessons Nigeria could draw from it. Thirty-one African 
countries were sampled for the study using data sourced from UNICEF-vital 
statistics (2010). Two hypotheses were tested and it was found that although 
there was negative correlation between demographic variables and life 
expectancy, demographic variables were not predictor of life expectancy. 
Although, environment/preventive health variables were collectively predictors 
of life expectancy, individually they were not. Nigeria should draw lessons on 
reducing under 5 and infant mortality, continuous improvement on water, 
sanitation, expanded programme on immunization and increase use of treated 
mosquito net to improve life expectancy.

Nephrology, Medical University of Silesia, Zabrze, Poland.

BACKGROUND: This study compared the health and economic benefits of saxagliptin 
versus insulin as second-line therapy with either metformin (MET) or 
sulfonylurea (SU) after failure of the respective monotherapies for patients 
with type 2 diabetes in Poland.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was assessed using a previously published 
diabetes model. Disease progression, utilities, and effects of changes in 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, and hypoglycemic events were taken from 
published studies, and Polish sources were used where possible.
RESULTS: MET + saxagliptin reduced severe hypoglycemic complications and weight 
versus MET + insulin, with an incremental benefit of 0.13 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 27,454 
Polish zloty (PLN) ($9,966 U.S.) per QALY gained. SU + saxagliptin showed an 
incremental benefit of 0.14 QALYs and ICER of 24,663 PLN ($8,953 U.S.) per QALY 
gained versus SU + insulin, with reduced incidence of symptomatic and severe 
hypoglycemias. Results were most sensitive to disutilities associated with 
weight gain, hypoglycemia, injection fear, HbA1c changes, threshold for 
switching treatment, and patients' age. Results were robust to various model 
assumptions and inputs. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 100,000 PLN 
($36,300 U.S.) per QALY gained, the probability that saxagliptin is 
cost-effective in these analyses was 74% (MET) and 76% (SU).
CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin in combination with MET or SU is likely to represent a 
cost-effective treatment option in Polish patients with type 2 diabetes failing 
first-line treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Decision-makers in the US may be interested in the applicability to 
their populations of cost-effectiveness results generated from clinical trial 
populations.
METHODS: An economic model estimating the cost-effectiveness of prasugrel plus 
aspirin relative to clopidogrel plus aspirin for patients with acute coronary 
syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was 
developed from a managed care organization (MCO) perspective. The model 
estimated 15-month cardiovascular events or bleeding-related outcomes, life 
expectancy, and costs for patients who received thienopyridine treatment during 
and after a PCI following a diagnosis of ACS. Post-ACS event rates for patients 
treated with clopidogrel were from an MCO. The relative risks of these events 
with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel were from a head-to-head clinical 
trial.
RESULTS: The results of the base-case analysis indicated that, in an MCO 
population, use of prasugrel-based therapy rather than clopidogrel-based therapy 
at current prices resulted in cost-savings and fewer clinical events over the 15 
months after an ACS diagnosis followed by PCI. At possible lower prices for 
generic clopidogrel-based therapy, the cost-effectiveness ratio for 
prasugrel-based therapy compared with clopidogrel-based therapy was between 
$6643 and $13,906 per life-year gained. The results were most sensitive to the 
relative costs of the two treatments and the cost for hospital stays.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the study included lack of follow-up of patients 
disenrolling from the MCO before the end of the 15-month observation period, the 
assumption of equal relative risks of events in an MCO as in the clinical trial, 
and the lack of information on the ratio of cost to charges in the MCO database.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of prasugrel-based therapy compared with clopidogrel-based 
therapy in ACS patients having a PCI resulted in cost-savings at current prices 
and favorable cost-effective ratios at likely generic prices for 
clopidogrel-based therapy because of offsetting savings in the costs of 
rehospitalization.

Proximity to disease and perception of utility: physicians' vs patients' 
assessment of treatment options for ulcerative colitis.

Brown LK(1), Waljee AK, Higgins PD, Waljee JF, Morris AM.

Author information:
(1)University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

BACKGROUND: Physician values regarding the benefit of continued medical therapy 
vs colectomy for moderate ulcerative colitis have not been defined. If 
physicians perceive these states differently than patients, their therapeutic 
recommendations may not align with patient values.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare physician and patient willingness to 
trade life years with moderately active ulcerative colitis vs undergoing 
colectomy.
DESIGN: This survey of physicians' and patients' utility values used 
standardized scenarios for moderately active ulcerative colitis and colectomy.
SETTING: The investigation was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center.
METHODS: Gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, and patients with ulcerative 
colitis who were either living with moderate disease or were postcolectomy 
completed the survey.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Utility values were measured by the use of the time 
trade-off method.
RESULTS: We surveyed 17 physicians, 150 postcolectomy patients, and 69 patients 
with moderate ulcerative colitis. Utility values for ulcerative colitis and 
colectomy states were (0.87, 0.95), (0.86, 0.92), and (0.91, 0.91). On average, 
physicians and postcolectomy patients assessed the utility of life with 
ulcerative colitis more poorly than the postcolectomy state. Patients with 
moderately active ulcerative colitis who had not undergone colectomy viewed both 
health states equally.
LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the physician subject sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients living with moderate ulcerative colitis value the pre- and 
postcolectomy states differently than physicians and postcolectomy patients. 
Recognizing the differences between their own and patients' values may help 
physicians to better counsel patients preoperatively. In addition, exposure to 
postcolectomy patients may help those with moderate disease who are weighing the 
comparative benefits of colectomy.

Critical interactionism: an upstream-downstream approach to health care reform.

Martins DC(1), Burbank PM.

Currently, per capita health care expenditures in the United States are more 
than 20% higher than any other country in the world and more than twice the 
average expenditure for European countries, yet the United States ranks 37th in 
life expectancy. Clearly, the health care system is not succeeding in improving 
the health of the US population with its focus on illness care for individuals. 
A new theoretical approach, critical interactionism, combines symbolic 
interactionism and critical social theory to provide a guide for addressing 
health care problems from both an upstream and downstream approach. Concepts of 
meaning from symbolic interactionism and emancipation from critical perspective 
move across system levels to inform and reform health care for individuals, 
organizations, and societies. This provides a powerful approach for health care 
reform, moving back and forth between the micro and macro levels. Areas of 
application to nursing practice with several examples (patients with obesity; 
patients who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; workplace bullying and 
errors), nursing education, and research are also discussed.

Modelling the cost-effectiveness of electric stimulation therapy in non-healing 
venous leg ulcers.

Taylor RR(1), Sladkevicius E, Guest JF.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of using electric stimulation (ES) 
therapy (Accel-Heal) plus dressings and compression bandaging compared with 
dressings and compression bandaging alone in treating chronic, non-healing 
venous leg ulcers (VLUs) of >6 months' duration from the perspective of the 
National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.
METHOD: A 5-month Markov model was constructed, depicting the management of a 
chronic, non-healing VLU of >6 months' duration. The model considers the 
decision by a clinician to continue with a patient's previous care plan 
(comprising dressings and compression bandaging) or treating with ES therapy 
plus dressings and compression bandaging. The model was used to estimate the 
relative cost-effectiveness of ES therapy at 2008-2009 prices.
RESULTS: According to the model, 38% of VLUs are expected to heal within 5 
months after starting ES therapy, with a further 57% expected to improve. This 
improvement in clinical outcome is expected to lead to a 6% health gain of 0.017 
QALYs (from 0.299 to 0.316 QALYs) over 5 months. The model also showed that 
using ES therapy instead of continuing with a patient's previous care plan is 
expected to reduce the NHS cost of managing them by 15%, from £880 to £749, due 
in part to a 27% reduction in the requirement for nurse visits (from mean 49.0 
to 35.9 visits per patient) over the first 5 months after the start of 
treatment. Hence, use of ES therapy was found to be a dominant treatment 
(improved outcome for less cost).
CONCLUSION: Within the model's limitations, use of ES therapy potentially 
affords the NHS a cost-effective treatment, compared with patients remaining on 
their previous care plan in managing chronic, non-healing VLUs of >6 months' 
duration. However, this is dependant on the number of ES therapy units per 
treatment, the unit cost of the device, and the number of nurse visits required 
to manage patients in clinical practice.

[Psychological support for patients with muscular dystrophy].

[Article in Japanese]

The life expectancy of patients with muscular dystrophy has increased in recent 
while their challenges of activity of daily living persist. Therefore, 
psychological support is crucial for patients with muscular dystrophy and their 
family members and caregivers. We have carried out several studies to explore 
appropriate psychological support for these patients. Individual counseling was 
effective to support the mental health of patients with muscular dystrophy; 
however counseling settings should be changed adapted to the physical conditions 
of patients. A short-term support group for family members was helpful for 
sharing information and concerns about child rearing. A case conference 
including physicians, nurses, caseworkers and clinical psychologists was held 
concerning a decreased patient. Combined case conferences with medical staff 
reduce psychological stress for staff and prevent from burnout syndrome. 
Research on how to explain the illness to boys with muscular dystrophy started 
in 2009. Interviews with adult patients revealed that they had wanted to know 
about their illness while they were young children. Half of their parents had 
hoped that their children would recognize the diagnosis by seeing friends with 
muscular dystrophy during hospitalization. Some of the parents explained the 
diagnosis to their children directly during childhood, hoping to battle the 
illness together. In 2010, we studied the attitudes of pediatric neurologists 
toward explaining the muscular dystrophy diagnosis to children. Seventy percent 
of respondents answered that patients should be told about their illness. Many 
of them desired the opportunity to be trained in appropriate ways to tell 
children about the diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Infertility is an important health issue, but only a small fraction 
of the affected population receives treatment in Brazil, because it is not 
covered by the government or private health insurance plans. We developed a 
generational accounting-based mathematical model to assess the direct economic 
result of creating a citizen through IVF in different economic scenarios, and 
the potential economic benefit generated by the individual and his/her future 
offspring.
METHODS: A mathematical model analyzes the revenues and expenses of an 
IVF-conceived individual over his lifetime. We calculated the net present value 
(NPV) of an IVF-conceived citizen, and this value corresponds to the fiscal 
contribution to the government by an individual, from birth through his 
predicted life expectancy. The calculation used discount rates of 4.0 and 7.0% 
to depreciate the money value by time.
RESULTS: A 4.0% discount rate represents the most favorable economic scenario in 
Brazil, and it results in an NPV of US$ 61 428. A 7.0% discount rate represents 
a less favorable economic reality, and it results in a debit of U$ 563, but this 
debt may be compensated by his/her future offspring.
CONCLUSIONS: The fiscal contribution generated by each IVF-conceived citizen can 
justify an initial government investment in infertility treatment. Poor economic 
times in Brazil can sometimes result in a fiscal debt from each new 
IVF-conceived child, but this initial expenditure may be compensated by the 
fiscal contribution in the next generation.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy with resection of the splenic artery and splenectomy for 
pancreatic double cancers after total gastrectomy. Preservation of the 
pancreatic function via the blood supply from the posterior epiploic artery: 
report of a case.

The patient was a 56-year-old man who had previously undergone a total 
gastrectomy without splenectomy, and was diagnosed with pancreatic head and body 
cancers and primary solitary lung cancer. The pancreas body tumor invaded the 
origin of the splenic artery, and if the origin of the splenic artery were 
resected there would be no blood flow to the pancreas tail, resulting in a need 
for total pancreatectomy. However, we focused on the posterior epiploic artery 
(PEA), which is a less well known blood supply from the mesocolon to pancreatic 
body and tail, and planned to preserve the pancreatic tail as long as the 
resected margin of the pancreas was not malignant, considering his limited life 
expectancy. We performed a pancreaticoduodenectomy with resection of the origin 
of the splenic artery and splenectomy, preserving the pancreatic tail and PEA. 
The patient has been free from insulin therapy for blood sugar control, and has 
been well for 10 months after the surgery.

BACKGROUND: Person-years analysis is a fundamental tool of occupational 
epidemiology. A life table analysis system (LTAS), previously developed by the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, was limited by its 
platform and analysis and reporting capabilities. We describe the updating of 
LTAS for the Windows operating system (LTAS.NET) with improved properties.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS: A group of epidemiologists, programmers, and 
statisticians developed software, platform, and computing requirements. 
Statistical methods include the use of (indirectly) standardized mortality 
ratios, (directly) standardized rate ratios, confidence intervals, and P values 
based on the normal approximation and exact Poisson methods, and a trend 
estimator for linear exposure-response associations.
SOFTWARE FEATURES: We show examples using LTAS.NET to stratify and analyze 
multiple fixed and time-dependent variables. Data import, stratification, and 
reporting options are highly flexible. Users may export stratified data for 
Poisson regression modeling.
CONCLUSIONS: LTAS.NET incorporates improvements that will facilitate more 
complex person-years analysis of occupational cohort data.

BACKGROUND: Canadian First Nations, the largest of the Aboriginal groups in 
Canada, have had lower cancer incidence and mortality rates than non-Aboriginal 
populations in the past. This pattern is changing with increased life 
expectancy, a growing population, and a poor social environment that influences 
risk behaviors, metabolic conditions, and disparities in screening uptake. These 
factors alone do not fully explain differences in cancer risk between 
populations, as genetic susceptibility and environmental factors also have 
significant influence. However, genetics and environment are difficult to 
modify. This study compared modifiable behavioral risk factors and 
metabolic-associated conditions for men and women, and cancer screening 
practices of women, between First Nations living on-reserve and a non-First 
Nations Manitoba rural population (Canada).
METHODS: The study used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey and the 
Manitoba First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey to examine smoking, 
binge drinking, metabolic conditions, physical activity, fruit/vegetable 
consumption, and cancer-screening practices.
RESULTS: First Nations on-reserve had significantly higher rates of smoking (P < 
0.001), binge drinking (P < 0.001), obesity (P < 0.001) and diabetes (P < 
0.001), and less leisure-time physical activity (P = 0.029), and consumption of 
fruits and vegetables (P < 0.001). Sex differences were also apparent. In 
addition, First Nations women reported significantly less uptake of mammography 
screening (P < 0.001) but similar rates for cervical cancer screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this retrospective study, the future 
cancer burden is expected to be high in the First Nations on-reserve population. 
Interventions, utilizing existing and new health and social authorities, and 
long-term institutional partnerships, are required to combat cancer risk 
disparities, while governments address economic disparities.

Age of pension eligibility, gains in life expectancy, and social policy.

[Article in English, French]

Denton FT, Spencer BG.

Canadians are living longer and retiring younger. When combined with the aging 
of the baby-boom generation, that means that the “inactive” portion of the 
population is increasing and there are concerns about possibly large increases 
in the burden of support on those who are younger. We model the impact of 
continued future gains in life expectancy on the size of the population that 
receives public pension benefits. We pay special attention to possible increases 
in the age of eligibility and the pension contribution rate that would maintain 
the publicly financed component of the retirement income security system.
