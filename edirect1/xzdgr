pancreatic fistula (13% vs. 5%), resulting more frequently in postoperative 
hemorrhage (18% vs. 5%, p = 0.002) among patients ≥80 years old. In the 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, patient age ≥80 years predicted 
postoperative mortality independently of the tumor entity and surgical technique 
(p = 0.013, OR 6.71, 95% CI [1.5-30.3]). Increased major postoperative morbidity 
was responsible for lower cost recovery in octogenarians (94% vs. 102%, p = 
0.046). In conclusion, patient age ≥80 years is associated with increased 
postoperative medical and surgical morbidity after major pancreatic surgery 
leading to lower cost recovery and a lower chance for successful resuscitation 
in patients requiring revisional surgery for postoperative hemorrhage and/or 
pancreatic fistula. In octogenarian patients suffering from pancreatic tumors, 
careful selection, and thorough prehabilitation is crucial to achieve the best 
postoperative and long-term oncologic outcomes.

Malaria is one of the health problems in West Southeast Maluku Regency, with 
Annual Parasite Incidence (API) is 15‰. There are not many surveys to studies 
conducted on vectors of malaria. This research aims to know the habitat, species 
of Anopheles sp., and know the malaria vector species in West Southeast Maluku 
area. This research was conducted between March - May 2016 in Alusi and Waturu 
villages. The method of collection was by man landing collections and 
examination on circum sporozoite protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) technique. Result of research was obtained the samples of An. 
flavirostris is 2 265 mosquitoes and An. barbirostris is 32 mosquitoes, with the 
biting activity was found to reach its peak at 19.00p.m-23.00 p.m. having 
characteristics of exophilic, exophagic and antrophophilic. The life expectancy 
of Anopheles sp. in nature is 62-77% with the life span of Anopheles sp. in the 
nature is below 2-4 days. Anopheles flavirostris and An. barbirostris positively 
contain the circum sporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum and 
Plasmodium vivax.

BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an ultra-rare, progressive, 
genetic disease leading to impaired lysosomal function and neurodegeneration 
causing serious morbidity and shortened life expectancy. The Niemann-Pick type C 
Clinical Severity Scale (NPCCSS) is a 17 domain, disease-specific, 
clinician-reported outcome measure of disease severity and progression. An 
abbreviated 5-domain NPCCSS scale has been developed (measuring Ambulation, 
Swallow, Cognition, Speech, and Fine Motor Skills) and the scale reliability has 
been established. Additional psychometric properties and meaningful change of 
the scale need, however, to be assessed.
METHODS: Mixed method studies were conducted to ascertain which NPCCSS domains 
were most important, as well as to explore meaningful change: 1) surveys in 
caregivers/patients (n = 49) and 2) interviews with clinicians (n = 5) as well 
as caregivers/patients (n = 28). Clinical trial data (n = 43) assessed construct 
validity and meaningful change through an anchor-based approach.
RESULTS: Domains identified as most important by clinicians, caregivers, and 
patients (independent of current age, age of onset, and disease severity) were 
Ambulation, Swallow, Cognition, Speech, and Fine Motor Skills, indicating 
content validity of the 5-domain NPCCSS. Criterion validity was shown with the 
5-domain NPCCSS being highly correlated with the 17-item NPCCSS total score 
(excluding hearing domains), r2 = 0.97. Convergent validity was demonstrated 
against the 9 Hole Peg Test, r2 = 0.65 (n = 31 patients), and the Scale for 
Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), r2 = 0.86 (n = 49 patients). Any change 
was seen as meaningful by patients/caregivers across domains. Meaningful change 
using trial data and interviews with NPC experts (n = 5) and patients/caregivers 
(n = 28) suggested that a 1-category change on a domain is equivalent to 1-point 
change or greater in the 5-domain NPCCSS total score.
CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative and quantitative data support content and construct 
validity of the 5-domain NPCCSS score as a valid endpoint in NPC trials. A 
1-category change on any domain is equivalent to 1-point change or greater in 
the 5 domain NPCCSS total score, representing a clinically meaningful transition 
and reflecting loss of complex function and increased disability. Trial

BACKGROUND: Non-infectious retinal disease, even in the HAART era, continues to 
be one of the most common diagnoses in patients with HIV, with prevalences of up 
to 27% of cases. This study aims to characterize the association between 
demographic variables and their role. as a risk factor for the development of 
non-opportunistic non-infectious retinal disease in patients with HIV/AIDS 
METHODS: An integrative review of the literature was carried out according to 
Arksey O'Malley's approach, based on the PICO methodology and following the 
preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 
recommendations; An exhaustive search was carried out in databases of articles 
that were filtered using established criteria, with their extraction and 
analysis carried out qualitatively.
RESULTS: Ocular manifestations from any cause develop from 35 years of age in 
patients with HIV/AIDS, with the highest risk for age-related macular 
degeneration over the fourth decade of life and for the development of 
neuroretinal disorder on the fifth decade of life; some studies report a slight 
tendency to diagnose macular degeneration in women and those who acquired AIDS 
through sexual contact; data contrasted with increased risk for diagnosing 
neuroretinal disorder in homosexual men who also use intravenous drugs, possibly 
due to oversampling in studies; non-Hispanic whites and African Americans were 
the races most commonly affected by neuroretinal disease; the means between the 
11.3 to 14.5 years elapsed since the HIV diagnosis were more frequently 
associated with cognitive impairment and both in those with high or low CD4 
counts, and in patients with high or low viral loads, neuroretinal disease 
without Statistically significant differences. Adherence and early initiation of 
HAART had a modest impact on the development of neuroretinal disease.
DISCUSSION: Even in the HAART era, non-infectious neuroretinal disease and 
cytomegalovirus retinitis remain the most frequent ocular diagnoses, however, 
different studies argue an increase in age-related non-infectious retinal 
diseases in patients with HIV, theories that are may explain by the increase in 
life expectancy, the metabolic effects of HAART itself or the generalized 
pro-inflammatory state in this group of patients, it is essential to recognize 
this new diagnostic challenge in order to direct preventive efforts through the 
use of cost-effective sociodemographic risk predictors towards that 
technological tools for diagnosis and treatment can be targeted.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV/AIDS patients who present at the ophthalmological consultation 
with the suggested sociodemographic predictors have a high risk of visual 
impairment due to non-infectious retinopathy, therefore prevention, diagnosis 
and treatment efforts directed at these diseases should be increased.

PURPOSE: Altered movement complexity, indicative of system dysfunction, has been 
demonstrated with increased running velocity and neuromuscular fatigue. The 
critical velocity (CV) denotes a metabolic and neuromuscular fatigue threshold. 
It remains unclear whether changes to complexity during running are coupled with 
the exercise intensity domain in which it is performed. The purpose of this 
study was to examine whether movement variability and complexity differ 
exclusively above the CV intensity during running.
METHODS: Ten endurance-trained participants ran at 95%, 100%, 105% and 115% CV 
for 20 min or to task failure, whichever occurred first. Movement at the hip, 
knee, and ankle were sampled throughout using 3D motion analysis. Complexity of 
kinematics in the first and last 30 s were quantified using sample entropy 
(SampEn) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA-α). Variability was determined 
using standard deviation (SD).
RESULTS: SampEn decreased during all trials in knee flexion/extension and it 
increased in hip internal/external rotation, whilst DFA-α increased in knee 
internal/external rotation. SD of ankle plantar/dorsiflexion and 
inversion/eversion, knee internal/external rotation, and hip flexion/extension 
and abduction/adduction increased during trials. Hip flexion/extension SampEn 
values were lowest below CV. DFA-α was lower at higher velocities compared to 
velocities below CV in ankle plantar/dorsiflexion, hip flexion/extension, hip 
adduction/abduction, hip internal/external rotation. In hip flexion/extension SD 
was highest at 115% CV.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes to kinematic complexity over time are consistent between 
heavy and severe intensity domains. The findings suggest running above CV 
results in increased movement complexity and variability, particularly at the 
hip, during treadmill running.

The causes and consequences of aging have always been a concern. In recent 
studies, changes in the stress response capacity of cells during aging were 
quantitatively analyzed. It was found that aging was accompanied by a decline in 
response capacity. When the response capacity decreased to a critical value, 
which we assumed was the internal noise level, the cell soon died. To survive, 
the response capacity should be, at minimum, sufficiently strong to resist 
intracellular noise. Here, we discuss the role of stress response capacity in 
aging and conjecture that lifespan might be extended by enhancing stress 
response capacity.

Robin sequence is characterized by mandibular retrognathia, airway obstruction, 
and glossoptosis; 80%-90% also have a cleft palate. Various treatment approaches 
exist, and although controlled studies are rare, objective assessment of 
treatment outcomes that address the leading clinical issues, namely obstructive 
sleep apnea and failure to thrive, are essential. Sleep-disordered breathing may 
be detected using cardiorespiratory polygraphy or polysomnography. Pulse 
oximetry alone may miss infants with frequent obstructive apneas, yet no 
intermittent hypoxia. Among conservative treatment options, the Tubingen Palatal 
Plate with a velar extension shifting the tongue base forward is the only 
approach that corrects the underlying anatomy and that has undergone appropriate 
evaluation. Of the surgical treatment options, which are not necessarily the 
first line of therapy, mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) is effective 
and has been most extensively adopted. Notwithstanding, it is puzzling that MDO 
is frequently used in some countries, yet hardly ever in others, despite similar 
tracheostomy rates. Thus, prospective multicenter studies with side-by-side 
comparisons aimed at identifying an optimal treatment paradigm for this 
potentially life-threatening condition are urgently needed.

AIMS: Veno-arterial (VA) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for 
post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS) after adult cardiac surgery is 
associated with satisfactory hospital survival. However, data on long-term 
survival of these critically ill patients are scarce.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2010 and March 2018, 665 consecutive 
patients received VA-ECMO for PCS at 17 cardiac surgery centres and herein we 
evaluated their 5-year survival. The mean follow-up of this cohort was 
1.7 ± 2.7 years (for hospital survivors, 4.6 ± 2.5 years). In this cohort, 240 
(36.1%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Five-year survival of all 
patients was 27.7%. The PC-ECMO score was predictive of 5-year survival in these 
patients (0 point, 50.9%; 1 point, 44.9%; 2 points, 40.0%; 3 points, 34.7%; 4 
points, 21.0%; 5 points, 17.6%; ≥6 points, 10.7%; P < 0.0001). Age was among 
factors independently associated with late survival, patients >70 years old 
having a remarkably poor 5-year survival (<60 years: 39.2%; 60-69 years: 29.9%; 
70-79 years: 12.3%; ≥80 years: 13.0%, P < 0.0001). Implantation of a ventricular 
assist device or heart transplant was performed in 3.2% of patients and their 
5-year survival was 42.9% (for heart transplant, 63.6%).
CONCLUSION: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for PCS is 
associated with satisfactory 5-year survival in young patients without critical 
pre-ECMO conditions. The use of VA-ECMO for PCS in patients >70 years should be 
considered only after a judicious scrutiny of patient's life expectancy. Future 
studies should evaluate whether satisfactory mid-term survival of these patients 
translates into a good functional outcome.

DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this expert review is to describe the role of 
medications for the chemoprevention of colorectal neoplasia. Neoplasia is 
defined as precancerous lesions (e.g., adenoma and sessile serrated lesion) or 
cancer. The scope of this review excludes dietary factors and high-risk 
individuals with hereditary syndromes or inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: The best practice advice statements are based on a review of the 
literature to provide practical advice. A formal systematic review and rating of 
the quality of evidence or strength of recommendation were not performed. BEST 
PRACTICE ADVICE 1: In individuals at average risk for CRC who are (1) younger 
than 70 years with a life expectancy of at least 10 years, (2) have a 10-year 
cardiovascular disease risk of at least 10%, and (3) not at high risk for 
bleeding, clinicians should use low-dose aspirin to reduce CRC incidence and 
mortality. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In individuals with a history of CRC, 
clinicians should consider using aspirin to prevent recurrent colorectal 
neoplasia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: In individuals at average risk for CRC, 
clinicians should not use non-aspirin NSAIDs to prevent colorectal neoplasia 
because of a substantial risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse 
events. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: In individuals with type 2 diabetes, clinicians 
may consider using metformin to prevent colorectal neoplasia. BEST PRACTICE 
ADVICE 5: In individuals with CRC and type 2 diabetes, clinicians may consider 
using metformin to reduce mortality. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Clinicians should 
not use calcium or vitamin D (alone or together) to prevent colorectal 
neoplasia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Clinicians should not use folic acid to 
prevent colorectal neoplasia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In individuals at average 
risk for CRC, clinicians should not use statins to prevent colorectal neoplasia. 
BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: In individuals with a history of CRC, clinicians should 
not use statins to reduce mortality.

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of mechanical vibration 
on postharvest quality and volatile compounds in blueberries (Vaccinium spp. 
Berkeley). Ethylene production, respiratory rate, firmness, decay incidence, 
soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acid content (TAC), flavonoid content, 
total phenols content (TPC), enzyme activity and volatile compounds of blueberry 
fruit were determined. Results showed that mechanical vibration resulted in the 
increase of ethylene production, respiratory rate, decay incidence and the 
decrease of firmness, enzyme activity, SSC, TAC, flavonoid content, TPC in 
blueberries comparing with the control. Moreover, mechanical vibration improved 
the relative content of alcohols and decreased the relative content of esters in 
comparison with the control group. In conclusion, the effect of transport 
vibration on blueberry quality was conspicuous. The quality of blueberry fruit 
gradually decreased with the extension of vibration time during the 
transportation, which seriously reduced storage life and commodity value of 
blueberries.

PURPOSE: To adapt the management of prostate malignancy in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: In according to the recommendations of the European Association of 
Urology, we have developed practical additional document on the treatment of 
prostate cancer.
RESULTS: Low-Risk Group Watchful Waiting should be offered to patients >75 years 
old, with a limited life expectancy and unfit for local treatment. In Active 
Surveillance (AS) patients re-biopsy, PSA evaluation and visits should be 
deferred for up to 6 months, preferring non-invasive multiparametric-MRI. The 
active treatment should be delayed for 6-12 months. Intermediate-Risk Group AS 
should be offered in favorable-risk patients. Short-course neoadjuvant androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with ultra-hypo-fractionation radiotherapy 
should be used in unfavorable-risk patients. High-Risk Group Neoadjuvant ADT 
combined with moderate hypofractionation should be preferred. Whole-pelvis 
irradiation should be offered to patients with positive lymph nodes in locally 
advanced setting. ADT should be initiated if PSA doubling time is < 12 months in 
radio-recurrent patients, as well as in low priority/low volume of metastatic 
hormone sensitive prostate cancer. If radiotherapy cannot be delayed, 
hypo-fractionated regimens should be preferred. In high priority class 
metastatic disease, treatment with androgen receptor-targeted agents should be 
offered. When palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastasis is required, 
single fraction of 8 Gy should be offered.
CONCLUSIONS: In Covid-19 Era, the challenge should concern a correct management 
of the oncologic patient, reducing the risk of spreading the virus without 
worsening tumor prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of embelin (EMB) on 
various epileptic models and related brain inflammation.
METHODS: Male Swiss albino mice were administered EMB (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/p.o.) 
in acute and chronic study for 7 days and 35 days, respectively. Acute study 
included increasing current electroshock (ICES) and pentylenetetrazol 
(PTZ)-induced seizure test. Step-down latency (SDL) and forced swim test (FST) 
were performed to evaluate cognitive functions and depression-like behavior, 
respectively. Chronic study included PTZ-induced kindling. Levels of 
inflammatory biomarkers, namely interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-1 
receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), were estimated in the hippocampus and cortex of the 
kindled brains by ELISA technique. Further, neurotransmitters (NTs), namely 
gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and dopamine, were estimated by using 
validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method followed by 
ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC).
RESULTS: Embelin (EMB) treatment increased the seizure threshold to hind limb 
extension (HLE) in the ICES test and decreased the seizure scores in the 
kindling experiment. Significantly low levels of IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-6, and TNF-α 
were observed in the hippocampus of PTZ + EMB (10 and 20 mg/kg)-treated groups 
compared with PTZ+ vehicle-treated group. Significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, 
IL-6, and TNF-α compared with PTZ+ vehicle-treated group were observed in the 
cortex of PTZ + EMB (10 and 20 mg/kg)-treated groups, while IL-1β levels were 
found to be significantly lower only in the cortex of PTZ + EMB 
(20 mg/kg)-treated group. Increased levels of dopamine and GABA and decreased 
levels of glutamate in both hippocampus and cortex were observed in 
EMB + PTZ-treated groups compared with vehicle + PTZ-treated group. Latency of 
step down was found to be increased and immobility time in FST was decreased in 
EMB + PTZ groups compared with vehicle + PTZ group.
CONCLUSION: Embelin suppressed epileptogenesis in the kindled mice via 
neurochemical modulation of neurotransmitters and inhibiting the inflammatory 
pathway. Further, EMB was also observed to be protecting the kindled animals 
from cognition and depression-like behavior.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), compared with 
an arteriovenous graft (AVG), is associated with longer initial catheter 
dependence after starting hemodialysis (HD) but longer access survival and lower 
long-term catheter dependence. The extent of these potential long-term benefits 
in elderly patients is unknown. We assessed catheter dependence after AVF or AVG 
placement among elderly patients who initiated HD without a permanent access in 
place.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients≥67 years of age identified in the US Renal Data 
System who had a first AVF (n=14,532) or AVG (n=3,391) placed within 1 year 
after HD initiation between May 2012 and May 2017.
EXPOSURE: AVF versus AVG placement in the first year of HD.
OUTCOME: Catheter dependence after AVF or AVG placement assessed using CROWNWeb 
data.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Generalized estimating equations and negative binomial 
regression for catheter use over time and Cox proportional hazards models for 
mortality.
RESULTS: Creation of an AVF versus AVG placement was associated with greater 
catheter dependence at 1 month (95.6% vs 92.5%) and 3 months (82.8% vs 41.2%), 
but lower catheter dependence at 12 months (14.2% vs 15.8%) and 36 months (8.2% 
vs 15.0%). Creation of an AVF, however, remained significantly associated with 
greater cumulative catheter-dependent days (80.1 vs 54.6 days per person-year) 
and a lower proportion of catheter-free survival time (78.1% vs 85.1%) after 3 
years of follow-up.
LIMITATIONS: Potential for unmeasured confounding and analyses limited to 
elderly patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Creation of an AVF was associated with significantly greater 
cumulative catheter dependence than placement of an AVG in an elderly population 
initiating HD without a permanent access. As the long-term benefits in terms of 
catheter dependence of an AVF are not realized in many elderly patients, 
specific patient characteristics should be considered when making decisions 
regarding vascular access.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is considered to be the 
fourth 90 of UNAIDS 90-90-90 target to monitor the effects of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART has significantly increased the life 
expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, the impact of 
chronic infection on HRQoL remains unclear, while factors influencing the HRQoL 
may vary from one country to another. The current study aimed to assess HRQoL 
and its associated factors among PLWHA receiving ART in Pakistan.
METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among PLWHA attending 
an ART centre of a tertiary care hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan. HRQoL was 
assessed using a validated Urdu version of EuroQol 5 dimensions 3 level 
(EQ-5D-3L) and its Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS).
RESULTS: Of the 602 patients included in the analyses, 59.5% (n = 358) reported 
no impairment in self-care, while 63.1% (n = 380) were extremely 
anxious/depressed. The overall mean EQ-5D utility score and visual analogue 
scale (EQ-VAS) score were 0.388 (SD: 0.41) and 66.20 (SD: 17.22), respectively. 
Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the factors significantly 
associated with HRQoL were: female gender; age  > 50 years; having primary and 
secondary education;  > 1 year since HIV diagnosis; HIV serostatus 
AIDS-converted; higher CD 4 T lymphocytes count; detectable viral load; and 
increased time to ART.
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings have shown that PLWHA in Pakistan adherent to 
ART had a good overall HRQoL, though with significantly higher depression. Some 
of the factors identified are amenable to institution-based interventions while 
mitigating depression to enhance the HRQoL of PLWHA in Pakistan. The HRQoL 
determined in this study could be useful for future economic evaluation studies 
for ART and in designing future interventions.

Bitterlings, a group of freshwater teleosts, provide a fascinating example among 
vertebrates of the evolution of brood parasitism. Their eggs are laid inside the 
gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts where they develop as brood 
parasites. Studies of the embryonic development of bitterlings are crucial in 
deciphering the evolution of their distinct early life-history. Here, we have 
studied 255 embryos and larvae of the rosy bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus) using 
in vitro fertilization and X-ray microtomography (microCT). We describe 11 
pre-hatching and 13 post-hatching developmental stages spanning the first 
14 days of development, from fertilization to the free-swimming stage. In 
contrast to previous developmental studies of various bitterling species, the 
staging system we describe is character-based and therefore more compatible with 
the widely-used stages described for zebrafish. Our bitterling data provide new 
insights into to the polarity of the chorion, and into notochord vacuolization 
and yolk sac extension in relation to body straightening. This study represents 
the first application of microCT scanning to bitterling development and provides 
one of the most detailed systematic descriptions of development in any teleost. 
Our staging series will be an important tool for heterochrony analysis and other 
comparative studies of teleost development, and may provide insight into the 
co-evolution of brood parasitism.

AIM: The research sheds light on the challenges and limitations of Spanish and 
Italian hospital design by looking at the gaps between education and practice.
BACKGROUND: Hospital design plays an important role in providing high-quality 
and cost-effective facilities for any healthcare system. Spain and Italy face 
contemporary challenges (i.e., elderly population, staff retention, and obsolete 
healthcare facilities) and have similar issues of life expectancy, health 
expenditure, hospital beds provision, and decentralized tax-financed healthcare 
systems.
METHOD: A cross-sectional, mixed-method study was used. This involved two 
different data collection strategies and analysis for each area of 
investigation: (i) education and (ii) practice. For the former, educational 
programs were reviewed via a web search; for the latter, an online survey of 53 
architectural/engineering offices involved in hospital design was conducted.
RESULTS: Hospital design education is limited to 0/58 in Spanish and 2/60 
courses in Italian universities, although each country offers three postgraduate 
courses. The practitioners' survey shows that even though their offices have a 
long history of healthcare design, only 48% in Spain and 60% in Italy have 
received specific university training. Office staff lack employees with medical 
backgrounds, which hinders any partnership between health and design fields 
either for design practice or the education fields. Laws, national regulations, 
technical guidelines, and previous experience are the most useful information 
sources, while international scientific publications appear underused by 
practitioners.
CONCLUSIONS: Italian and Spanish healthcare architecture could be improved by 
promoting multidisciplinary teams (in practice and education) and improving the 
education offer by tailoring it to national needs.

This study investigated the effects of custom-fitted compression garments (CG) 
worn during recovery over a multi-day training camp in elite judo players 
(judoka). A single blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 11 elite 
judoka, using a two-way crossover design. Two three-day training camps were 
completed in CG and placebo conditions in a random order. Changes in performance 
and physiological markers were compared between conditions. Judoka were assessed 
before training for (maximal) isometric knee extension and grip strength, 
countermovement jump performance and bench-press velocity, alongside soreness, 
limb circumferences, plasma creatine kinase activity (CK) and perceived 
bruising. Measurements were repeated after 12, 36 and 43 h of training, 
whereupon judoka rated the effectiveness of each intervention. Knee extension 
and bench-press performance demonstrated significant familiarization 
(p < 0.001), and were excluded from subsequent analysis. Jump performance was 
unaffected by training (p > 0.05). Grip strength declined throughout training 
(p < 0.001), with peak decrements of -9.7% indicating mild muscle damage. 
Increases in bruising, CK and soreness demonstrated highly variable, if 
significant (p < 0.001) responses. Although CG were perceived as significantly 
more effective than placebo for recovery (p = 0.046), no effects were observed 
for any other outcome (p > 0.05). Compression conferred no statistically 
significant impact upon recovery markers in elite judoka throughout training. 
Muscle damage responses were inconsistent in this population. Individual 
athletes would be advised to monitor habitually-used performance measures while 
using CG to ascertain whether perceptual benefits translate into enhanced 
recovery.HighlightsCompression garments were perceived as more effective for

The United Nations estimates that the world's population will reach 8.5 billion 
by 2030, and the populations of most countries are expected to grow older. This 
is case for many developed countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, 
Canada, the United States of America, and member states of the European Union. 
Older cohorts will comprise a larger proportion of overall populations, driven 
in part by our increases in life expectancy. An ageing population poses 
challenges for governments; notably, older people tend to have multiple, chronic 
health conditions which can place a burden of health budgets. At the same time, 
we are witnessing a shift in how we respond to the health needs of our 
populations, with global drug policy acknowledging that some substances are 
contributing to increased morbidity and mortality (e.g. opioids) while others 
may have beneficial therapeutic effects (e.g. psylocibin, cannabis). There is 
general agreement that as men age their levels of testosterone decrease, and 
there is some evidence to suggest that there have been population-level declines 
in testosterone which are not associated with age. Anecdotally, testosterone is 
accessed by men seeking to self-medicate in the belief that they are 
experiencing low testosterone levels. There has also been a rise in anti-ageing 
clinics in the United States, providing access to testosterone replacement 
therapy (TRT). The non-medical use of testosterone can result in a number of 
adverse health events, including complications from the use of black market or 
underground products. Placing testosterone under a new prescribing regime may 
address some of these concerns, but is society ready for this change, and if so, 
what would this regime look like? This paper will explore the issue of how 
society responds to enhancement for longevity, or how we increasingly use 
pharmaceuticals to address and prevent illness, with a specific focus on 
testosterone and testosterone deficiency.

Cycles of Gender Convergence and Divergence in Drug Overdose Mortality.

Ho JY(1).

Gerontology and Department of Sociology, University of Southern California, Los 
Angeles, CA 90089-0191.

The United States is 25 years into a large-scale drug overdose epidemic, yet its 
consequences for gender differences remain largely unexplored. This study finds 
that drug overdose mortality increased seven- and fivefold for men and women, 
respectively; accounts for 0.8-year (men) and 0.4-year (women) deficits in life 
expectancy at birth in 2017; and has made an increasing contribution (from 1 
percent to 17 percent) to women's life expectancy advantage at the prime adult 
ages between 1990 and 2017. I document a distinctive cyclicality to sex 
differences in drug overdose. During the epidemic's early stages - the heyday of 
prescription opioids - gender differences narrowed, but once the epidemic 
transitioned to illicit drugs in 2010, gender differences widened again. This 
pattern holds across racial/ethnic groups, and in fact may be even stronger 
among Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks than among non-Hispanic Whites. That we 
observe this gender dynamic across racial/ethnic groups is surprising since very 
different trends in drug overdose mortality have been observed for Whites versus 
other groups. The contemporary epidemic is a case of dynamic change in gender 
differences, and the differential mortality risks experienced by men and women 
reflect gendered social norms, attitudes towards risk, and patterns of 
diffusion.

RATIONALE: The recently discovered meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) have been 
proposed to be the missing link between the immune and the central nervous 
system. The role of mLVs in modulating the neuro-immune response following a 
traumatic brain injury (TBI), however, has not been analyzed. Parenchymal T 
lymphocyte infiltration has been previously reported as part of secondary events 
after TBI, suggestive of an adaptive neuro-immune response. The phenotype of 
these cells has remained mostly uncharacterized. In this study, we identified 
subpopulations of T cells infiltrating the perilesional areas 30 days 
post-injury (an early-chronic time point). Furthermore, we analyzed how the lack 
of mLVs affects the magnitude and the type of T cell response in the brain after 
TBI.
METHODS: TBI was induced in K14-VEGFR3-Ig transgenic (TG) mice or in their 
littermate controls (WT; wild type), applying a controlled cortical impact 
(CCI). One month after TBI, T cells were isolated from cortical areas 
ipsilateral or contralateral to the trauma and from the spleen, then 
characterized by flow cytometry. Lesion size in each animal was evaluated by 
MRI.
RESULTS: In both WT and TG-CCI mice, we found a prominent T cell infiltration in 
the brain confined to the perilesional cortex and hippocampus. The majority of 
infiltrating T cells were cytotoxic CD8+ expressing a CD44hiCD69+ phenotype, 
suggesting that these are effector resident memory T cells. K14-VEGFR3-Ig mice 
showed a significant reduction of infiltrating CD4+ T lymphocytes, suggesting 
that mLVs could be involved in establishing a proper neuro-immune response. 
Extension of the lesion (measured as lesion volume from MRI) did not differ 
between the genotypes. Finally, TBI did not relate to alterations in peripheral 
circulating T cells, as assessed one month after injury.
