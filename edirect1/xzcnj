METHODS: Utilizing the Inpatient Databases of the Healthcare Cost & Utilization 
Project spanning 2008-2013, we identified all adult recipients of KTxp by 
procedural codes and recipients who are HIV+ve by ICD-9 codes. We extracted 
demographic, clinical, and resource utilization variables and compared 
recipients who are HIV+ve with those who are HIV-negative (HIV-ve). We then 
performed descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis using logistic 
regression to assess the effect of HIV on clinical and utilization outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 104,137 patients had kidney transplants during the study 
period. Of the total, 605 patients were HIV+ve. Infections rates were similar 
among patients who were HIV+ve and HIV-ve (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, confidence 
interval [CI] 0.58-2.40; P = .652). In-hospital mortality rates were also 
similar (OR 0.83, CI 0.18-3.69; P = .80). Hospital charges for patients who were 
HIV+ve were no different from patients who were HIV-ve ($195,099 ± 1074 vs 
$186,567 ± 9558; P = .38).
CONCLUSION: Clinical and fiscal outcomes are comparable among patients who are 
HIV+ve and HIV-ve during transplant hospitalization.

OBJECTIVES: Cost data for pediatric heart transplantation are scarce. We 
examined hospital cost of the national pediatric heart transplantation program 
in Australia and assessed factors associated with increased costs.
METHODS: The hospital cost of all children who underwent heart transplantation 
at a national referral center between January 2003 and June 2015 and were 
followed more than 1 year was retrospectively analyzed. Lifetime follow-up costs 
were adjusted for quality of life and projected to life expectancy. All costs 
were reported in 2016 US dollars.
RESULTS: Of 70 children who underwent heart transplantation in the study period, 
61 were followed more than 1 year after transplantation (mean, 4.3 ± 2.5 years). 
Mean cost of primary heart transplantation was $278,480 (95% confidence 
interval, 219,282-337,679) and did not change over time. Pretransplant 
mechanical circulatory support was required in 36% (22/61) of children. On 
multivariable analysis, greater admission costs were associated with ventricular 
assist device and pretransplant length of stay. Mean annual follow-up cost after 
discharge was $55,823 (95% confidence interval, 47,631-64,015) in the first year 
and $12,119 (95% confidence interval, 8578-15,661) thereafter. Increased 
first-year follow-up costs were associated with endomyocardial biopsies and 
length of readmissions. Cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained varied from 
$29,161 to $44,481 on sensitivity analysis. Freedom from treated rejections was 
65.5% at 1 year, 63.2% at 3 years, and 59.5% at 5 years. Endomyocardial biopsies 
contributed to 52% of first-year follow-up costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary pediatric heart transplantation in Australia is 
cost-effective for long-term survivors, even for those supported by ventricular 
assist device. Surveillance endomyocardial biopsy was a major contributor to 
post-transplantation costs. Selective targeting of surveillance biopsies may be 
cost-saving.

The effects of interstitial lung disease (ILD) create a significant burden on 
patients, unsettling almost every domain of their lives, disrupting their 
physical and emotional well-being and impairing their quality of life (QoL). 
Because many ILDs are incurable, and there are limited reliably-effective, 
life-prolonging treatment options available, the focus of many therapeutic 
interventions has been on improving or maintaining how patients with ILD feel 
and function, and by extension, their QoL. Such patient-centred outcomes are 
best assessed by patients themselves through tools that capture their 
perceptions, which inherently incorporate their values and judgements. These 
patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) can be used to assess an array of 
constructs affected by a disease or the interventions implemented to treat it. 
Here, we review the impact of ILD that may present with a progressive-fibrosing 
phenotype on patients' lives and examine how PROs have been used to measure that 
impact and the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Studies show that the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) continues 
post-discharge in nonsurgical patients with acute medical illness. Betrixaban is 
the first anticoagulant approved in the United States (US) for VTE prophylaxis 
extending beyond hospitalization.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to establish whether betrixaban for VTE prophylaxis in 
nonsurgical patients with acute medical illness at risk of VTE in the US is 
cost-effective compared with enoxaparin.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted, estimating the cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with betrixaban (35-42 days) compared 
with enoxaparin (6-14 days) from a US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. 
A decision tree (DT) estimated primary VTE events, thrombotic events, and 
treatment complications in the first 3 months based on data from the phase III 
Acute Medically Ill VTE Prevention with Extended Duration Betrixaban study. A 
Markov model estimated recurrent events and long-term complication risks from 
published literature. EuroQoL-5 Dimensions utility data and costs inflated to 
2017 US dollars (US$) were from published literature. Results were discounted at 
3.0% per annum. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Betrixaban dominated enoxaparin, with savings of US$784 and increased 
QALYs of 0.017 per patient. In addition, betrixaban dominated enoxaparin across 
all sensitivity analyses, but was most sensitive to utilities and DT 
probabilities. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that 
betrixaban was more cost-effective than enoxaparin at all willingness-to-pay 
thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Betrixaban can be considered cost-effective for nonsurgical patients 
with acute medical illness at risk of VTE, requiring longer VTE prophylaxis from 
hospitalization through post-discharge.

BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study is to assess the performance of the 
global health system, emphasising the contribution of people's happiness to 
health system efficiency across countries. Technical efficiency (TE) scores are 
estimated using the output-oriented variable returns to scale (VRS) data 
envelopment analysis (DEA) model based on the input measures: health 
expenditure, labour, hospital beds and education, and the output measures: 
healthy life expectancy and inverse mortality index. The efficiency scores are 
regressed against three explanatory variables: happiness index, population 
density, and healthcare share of gross domestic product (GDP). The analysis 
involved 121 selected countries using double bootstrap DEA as proposed by Simar, 
L., Wilson, P.W J Econ 136:1‑34, 2007.
RESULTS: The bootstrap truncated regression indicates that happiness is one of 
the factors that contributes significantly to health system efficiency. The 
study also revealed that the selected health systems perform well, on average, 
in terms of population density and healthcare share of GDP.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to improving the economic standard of living, 
policy-makers should also consider ways to increase the happiness and well-being 
of society. Policies focusing on well-being and happiness can lead to improved 
well-being and improved health outcomes, which may ultimately reduce the 
healthcare burden and enhance healthcare performance.

There is a lack of clarity in terms of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
comparisons across different outpatient (OPD) follow-up patterns in discharged 
patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In this study, adult patients hospitalised 
for BD treatment (n = 1,591) were identified from the National Health Insurance 
Research Database in Taiwan. With survival as the effectiveness measure and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the utility measure, a cost-effectiveness 
and cost-utility analysis was conducted over the 3-year follow-up period by 
post-discharge frequency of OPD visits. Compared to those making 1-7, 8-12 and 
18 or more OPD visits, BD patients making 13-17 OPD visits within the first year 
after discharge had the lowest psychiatric and total healthcare costs over the 
follow-up period. With survival status as the effectiveness outcome, making 
13-17 OPD visits was more likely to be the cost-effective option, as revealed by 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Cost-utility analysis demonstrated that 
having 13-17 OPD visits was probably the more cost-effective option when 
considering QALYs; for instance, if society was willing to pay NTD1.5 million 
for one additional QALY, there was a 75.2% (psychiatric costs) to 77.4% (total 
costs) likelihood that 13-17 OPD visits was the most cost-effective option. In 
conclusion, post-discharge OPD appointments with a frequency of 13-17 visits 
within the first year were associated with lower psychiatric and total 
healthcare costs in the subsequent 3 years. Having an adequate outpatient 
follow-up frequency was likely to be cost-effective in the management of 
discharged patients with BD in this real-world setting.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance is a significant issue, particularly for patients 
with advanced terminal illness. Currently, there are no practice-based 
recommended approaches for managing sleep and circadian disruptions in this 
population. To address this gap, a cross-sectional focus group study was 
performed engaging 32 staff members at four hospices/end-of-life programs in 
three demographically diverse counties in New York State.
METHODS: Participants responded to structured open-ended questions. Responses 
were transcribed and subjected to qualitative content analysis. The themes and 
recommendations for improved practice that emerged were tabulated using Atlas TI 
qualitative software.
RESULTS: This report details the experiences of hospice and end-of-life care 
staff in managing sleep and circadian disruptions affecting patients and 
analyzes their recommendations for improving care. Caregivers involved in the 
study described potential interventions that would improve sleep and reduce 
circadian disruptions. They particularly highlighted a need for improved 
evaluation and monitoring systems, as well as sleep education programs for both 
formal and informal caregivers.
CONCLUSIONS: The voiced experiences of frontline hospice and end-of-life 
caregivers confirmed that disruption in sleep and circadian rhythms is a common 
issue for their patients and is not effectively addressed in current research 
and practice. The caregivers' recommendations focused on management strategies 
and underscored the need for well-tested interventions to promote sleep in 
patients receiving end-of-life care. Additional research is needed to examine 
the effectiveness of systematic programs that can be easily integrated into the 
end-of-life care process to attenuate sleep disturbances.

Indonesia is a rapidly growing middle-income country with 262 million 
inhabitants from more than 300 ethnic and 730 language groups spread over 17 744 
islands, and presents unique challenges for health systems and universal health 
coverage (UHC). From 1960 to 2001, the centralised health system of Indonesia 
made gains as medical care infrastructure grew from virtually no primary health 
centres to 20 900 centres. Life expectancy improved from 48 to 69 years, infant 
mortality decreased from 76 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 23 per 1000, and the 
total fertility rate decreased from 5·61 to 2·11. However, gains across the 
country were starkly uneven with major health gaps, such as the stagnant 
maternal mortality of around 300 deaths per 100 000 livebirths, and minimal 
change in neonatal mortality. The centralised one size fits all approach did not 
address the complexity and diversity in population density and dispersion across 
islands, diets, diseases, local living styles, health beliefs, human 
development, and community participation. Decentralisation of governance to 354 
districts in 2001, and currently 514 districts, further increased health system 
heterogeneity and exacerbated equity gaps. The novel UHC system introduced in 
2014 focused on accommodating diversity with flexible and adaptive 
implementation features and quick evidence-driven decisions based on changing 
needs. The UHC system grew rapidly and covers 203 million people, the largest 
single-payer scheme in the world, and has improved health equity and service 
access. With early success, challenges have emerged, such as the so-called 
missing-middle group, a term used to designate the smaller number of people who 
have enrolled in UHC in wealth quintiles Q2-Q3 than in other quintiles, and the 
low UHC coverage of children from birth to age 4 years. Moreover, high costs for 
non-communicable diseases warrant new features for prevention and promotion of 
healthy lifestyles, and investment in a robust integrated digital 
health-information system for front-line health workers is crucial for impact 
and sustainability. This Review describes the innovative UHC initiative of 
Indonesia along with the future roadmap required to meet sustainable development 
goals by 2030.

Oscillatory flows of actomyosin play a key role in the migration of single cells 
in culture and in collective cell movements in Drosophila embryos. In vertebrate 
embryos undergoing convergent extension (CE), the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) 
pathway drives the elongation of the body axis and shapes the central nervous 
system, and mutations of the PCP genes predispose humans to various 
malformations including neural tube defects. However, the spatiotemporal 
patterns of oscillatory actomyosin contractions during vertebrate CE and how 
they are controlled by the PCP signaling remain unknown. Here, we address these 
outstanding issues using a combination of in vivo imaging and mathematical 
modeling. We find that effective execution of CE requires alternative 
oscillations of cortical actomyosin across cell membranes of neighboring cells 
within an optimal frequency range. Intriguingly, temporal and spatial clustering 
of the core PCP protein Prickle 2 (Pk2) is correlated to submembranous 
accumulations of F-actin, and depletion of Pk2 perturbs the oscillation of 
actomyosin contractions. These findings shed light on the significance of 
temporal regulation of actomyosin contraction by the PCP pathway during CE, in 
addition to its well-studied spatial aspects.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis increases the risk 
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After a sustained virologic response (SVR) 
to anti-HCV therapy, the risk of HCC is reduced but not eliminated. Recent 
developments in antiviral therapy have increased rates of SVR markedly. 
Guidelines recommend indefinite biannual ultrasound surveillance after SVR for 
patients with advanced fibrosis before treatment. Surveillance for HCC is cost 
effective before anti-HCV treatment; we investigated whether it remains so after 
SVR.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
biannual or annual HCC ultrasound surveillance vs no surveillance in 50-year-old 
patients with advanced fibrosis after an SVR to anti-HCV therapy. Parameter 
values were obtained from publications and expert opinions. Primary outcomes 
were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: With a constant 0.5% annual incidence of HCC, biannual and annual 
surveillance resulted in ICERs of $106,792 and $72,105 per QALY, respectively, 
with high false-positive rates. When surveillance was limited to patients with 
cirrhosis, but not F3 fibrosis, biannual surveillance likely was cost effective, 
with ICERs of $48,729 and $43,229 per QALY after treatment with interferon and 
direct-acting antiviral agents, respectively. In patients with F3 fibrosis, the 
incidence of HCC was 0.3% to 0.4% per year, leading to an ICER of $188,157 per 
QALY for biannual surveillance. If HCC incidence increases with age, 
surveillance becomes more cost effective but remains below willingness-to-pay 
thresholds only for patients with cirrhosis or with pretreatment aspartate 
aminotransferase to platelet ratio index greater than 2.0 or FIB-4 measurements 
greater than 3.25. Sensitivity analyses identified HCC incidence and transition 
rate to symptomatic disease without surveillance as factors that affect cost 
effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model, we found HCC surveillance after an SVR to HCV 
treatment to be cost effective for patients with cirrhosis, but not for patients 
with F3 fibrosis.

The landscape pattern will affect the sediment transport process. The cluster of 
ponds is a common landscape, which has traditionally been used for irrigation in 
the hilly area of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). However, little is known 
about how the landscape elements temporally changed over the past decades and if 
the ponds can be applied to function in balancing watershed sediments against 
soil erosion. The Jinglingxi watershed, covering 20.5 km2, was selected as the 
study area. The changes in pond number, surface area, and drainage catchment 
were analyzed with aid of high-resolution typographical map and unmanned aerial 
vehicles imagery. The spatial WaTEM/SEDEM model was developed to simulate 
watershed soil erosion and sediment deposition under the absence and presence of 
water bodies scenarios. Results from different simulation scenarios were 
compared and revealed the trapping effects of the multi-pond system. From 1983 
to 2016, the number and total area of ponds roughly doubled. The density reached 
30 ponds/km2. From 1983 to 2016, the total drainage area of ponds increased from 
13.22% to 35.4% of the whole watershed. The sediments deposited at the bottom of 
ponds can indicate the past specific sediment yield (SSY) in drainage 
catchments. Our results suggest that the multi-pond system not only reduce 
watershed sediment export but also alter the sediment deposition in different 
land uses. The reduced sediments export is expected to prolong the service life 
of downstream reservoirs at the expectancy of ponds' storage capacities. The 
ecological compensation from downstream reservoirs' revenues to upstream regions 
should be established to drive dredging actions for the upstream ponds.

Increasing human life expectancy has posed increasing challenges for healthcare 
systems. As people age, they become more susceptible to chronic diseases, with 
an increasing burden of multimorbidity, and the associated polypharmacy. 
Accumulating evidence from work with laboratory animals has shown that ageing is 
a malleable process that can be ameliorated by genetic and environmental 
interventions. Drugs that modulate the ageing process may delay or even prevent 
the incidence of multiple diseases of ageing. To identify novel, anti-ageing 
drugs, several studies have developed computational drug-repurposing strategies. 
We review published studies showing the potential of current drugs to modulate 
ageing. Future studies should integrate current knowledge with multi-omics, 
health records, and drug safety data to predict drugs that can improve health in 
late life.

Spinal cord injury is a disabling disorder, worldwide spread, with important 
consequences on functioning and health conditions and impacts on physical, 
psychological, and social well-being. The consequences are related to the lesion 
itself and to other complications related to the lesion. In the last decades, 
there have been an increasing of the mean ages of onset and also an increase in 
life expectancy after the lesion. So, differently from the past, people with 
spinal cord injury can age after the lesion. Taking into account the need to 
share data and information about specific disabling conditions and their 
relationship with ageing, this paper aims to discuss some issues from recent 
literature on the relationship between aging and disability in the spinal cord 
injury, according to a narrative review approach. A narrative review of the 
literature on ageing and spinal cord injury was undertaken. Search was based on 
the following electronic databases: PubMed/Medline and Ovid/PsychINFO. A 
combination of the following keywords was used: (1) "ageing" or "aging" and (2) 
"spinal cord injury" or "spinal cord lesion" and (3) disability. Data on 
consequences of the lesion in the life of aging people, secondary health 
conditions, life expectancy, participation, and quality of life are discussed. 
Then, a brief discussion of clinical issues and the role of interventions aimed 
to promote wellbeing, health, quality of life, and participation of people with 
spinal cord injury is proposed.

BACKGROUND: The world is experiencing the biggest wave of urban growth in 
history. The association between urbanization and health at the global level, as 
well as the role of air pollution, has not been studied. We aimed to examine the 
effect of urbanization on global health and the role of air pollution.
METHODS: Unbalanced panel data comprising 3, 093 observations of 163 countries 
for 1990-2012 from the World Bank database was used. An infinite distributed lag 
model was applied to estimate the contemporary and long-term effects of 
urbanization on health outcomes measured by mortality, under-five mortality, 
infant mortality, life expectancy at birth(all; female; and male).
RESULTS: Urbanization was positively related to global health in the short term 
and long term. In the short run, 1% increase in urbanization was associated with 
reduced mortality, under-five mortality, and infant mortality of 0.05%, 0.04%, 
and 0.04%, respectively, as well as increased life expectancy of 0.01 year. The 
effects of urbanization were stronger for high-income countries. However, air 
pollution undermined the positive impacts of urbanization on health.
CONCLUSION: Although urbanization leads to improved global health, air pollution 
undermines the positive effects of urbanization on health. Developing 
sustainable urbanization practices is crucial for addressing the challenges of 
pollution caused by urbanization.

Population ageing measured through a fixed old-age threshold like 60+ or 65+ 
ignores the other important dimensions of ageing. There has been changes among 
the older persons in multiple dimensions that corresponds to quantity of life 
years lived as well as the quality of life. The existing multi-dimensional 
measures also consider the characteristics within a fixed old-age threshold 
framework which does not account for significant improvements in life expectancy 
over the years. We propose a new Multidimensional Old Age Threshold (MOAT) 
measure that accommodates different dimensions of quantity and quality of older 
persons. We achieve this through a modified framework of the Characteristic 
Approach. Our measure incorporates a forward-looking approach to measure ageing 
and specifies an old-age threshold for different countries after accounting for 
different dimensions of life expectancy, health and human capital. This method 
is more suitable for comparison across countries with distinct demographic and 
health achievements. The empirical application of our method using selected 
countries from Europe and Asia shows that the relative performance of countries 
differs in terms of MOAT in comparison to estimates based on existing measures, 
primarily due to the inclusion of the quality dimensions. Countries that have 
better performance in life expectancy, health and human capital have higher 
values of MOAT and a lower 'burden' of older persons in a cross-country 
perspective in comparison to the existing measures.

OBJECTIVE: Add-on cannabidiol (CBD) significantly reduced seizures associated 
with Dravet syndrome (DS) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial: GWPCARE1 Part B (NCT02091375). Patients who completed GWPCARE1 Part A 
(NCT02091206) or Part B, or a second placebo-controlled trial, GWPCARE2 
(NCT02224703), were invited to enroll in a long-term open-label extension trial, 
GWPCARE5 (NCT02224573). We present an interim analysis of the safety, efficacy, 
and patient-reported outcomes from GWPCARE5.
METHODS: Patients received a pharmaceutical formulation of highly purified CBD 
in oral solution (100 mg/mL), titrated from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg/d over a 2-week 
period, with their existing medications. Based on response and tolerance, CBD 
could be reduced or increased up to 30 mg/kg/d.
RESULTS: By November 2016, a total of 278 patients had completed the original 
randomized trials, and 264 (95%) enrolled in this open-label extension. Median 
treatment duration was 274 days (range 1-512) with a mean modal dose of 21 
mg/kg/d, and patients received a median of 3 concomitant antiepileptic 
medications. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 93.2% of patients and were mostly 
mild (36.7%) or moderate (39.0%). Commonly reported AEs were diarrhea (34.5%), 
pyrexia (27.3%), decreased appetite (25.4%), and somnolence (24.6%). Seventeen 
patients (6.4%) discontinued due to AEs. Twenty-two of the 128 patients from 
GWPCARE1 (17.2%), all taking valproic acid, had liver transaminase elevations ≥3 
times the upper limit of normal. In patients from GWPCARE1 Part B, the median 
reduction from baseline in monthly seizure frequency assessed in 12-week periods 
up to week 48 ranged from 38% to 44% for convulsive seizures and 39% to 51% for 
total seizures. After 48 weeks of treatment, 85% of patients/caregivers reported 
improvement in the patient's overall condition on the Subject/Caregiver Global 
Impression of Change scale.
SIGNIFICANCE: This trial shows that long-term CBD treatment had an acceptable 
safety profile and led to sustained, clinically meaningful reductions in seizure 
frequency in patients with treatment-resistant DS.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is more prevalent in 
men than women and this disparity cannot be fully explained by known risk 
factors. Recent studies have shown that loss of Y chromosome (LoY) confers an 
increased risk of solid cancer and reduces life expectancy in men.
METHODS: Using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we 
investigated the prevalence of LoY and its association with clinicopathological 
features in male HNSCC.
RESULTS: LoY was detectable in around 25% of male HNSCC. Men with human 
papillomavirus-negative tumors exhibiting LoY experienced significantly worse 
overall survival than those with no LoY. Moreover, LoY tumors exhibited 
overexpression of genes involved in redox processes, including genes previously 
implicated in resistance to both radiotherapy and cisplatin-based 
chemotherapeutics.
CONCLUSION: LoY may be an indicator of poor prognosis in male HNSCC that is 
linked to the overexpression of genes associated with resistance to standard 
care therapies.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with 
poor prognosis and limited options for treatment. Life expectancy after 
diagnosis is short; the currently available treatments are not well tolerated 
and have limited clinical benefit. There is a clear unmet clinical need for the 
development of new treatments. In this study, ultrasmall, 2 nm gold core 
nanoparticles (MidaCore) conjugated with the potent maytansine analogue DM1 
(MTC-100038) were assessed as a systemic nanomedicine for the treatment of 
hepatocellular carcinoma. The platform improved overall tolerability of DM1, 
permitting ∼3-fold higher levels of drug to be administered compared to free 
drug. Dose for dose, MTC-100038 also facilitated delivery of ∼2.0-fold higher ( 
p = 0.039) levels of DM1 to the tumor compared to free DM1. MTC-100038 produced 
significant efficacy (tumor growth index ∼102%; p = <0.0001), in several murine 
xenograft models of HCC, and was superior to both free DM1 and the current 
standard of care, sorafenib. Furthermore, MTC-100038 displayed potent (nM) in 
vitro activity in various HCC primary patient derived cell lines and across 
various other different cancer cell types. These data demonstrate the potential 
of MidaCore nanoparticles to enhance tumor delivery of cytotoxic drugs and 
indicate MTC-100038 is worthy of further investigation as a potential treatment 
for HCC and other cancer types.

Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. Email: ksaika@ncc.go.jp

Background: Together with such high-quality approaches as randomized controlled 
trials and large-scale cohort studies, simulation models are often employed to 
evaluate the effect of cancer screening methods and decide on their 
appropriateness. This study aimed to evaluate all effects of gastric cancer 
screening that have been assessed using simulation models, including 
cost-effectiveness, mortality reduction, and early-stage detection. Methods: We 
performed a systematic review using PubMed and Web of Science. We evaluated the 
effect of screening related to cost, such as incremental cost-effectiveness and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; we also separately assessed effects other 
than cost, such as quality-adjusted life-years, number of deaths prevented, 
life-years saved, relative risk of mortality from gastric cancer, life 
expectancy, and incidence reduction. The methods targeted for evaluation were 
Helicobacter pylori testing or endoscopy. Results: We identified 19 studies 
dealing with simulation models in gastric cancer screenings: 14 examined H. 
pylori screening and 7 focused on endoscopy. Among those studies, two assessed 
both H. pylori and endoscopy screening. Most of the studies adopted a Markov 
model, and all the studies evaluated cost-effectiveness. Of the 14 H. pylori 
screening studies, 13 demonstrated cost-effectiveness and 11 also showed good 
results other than cost-effectiveness, such as extension of life-years and 
increase in early-stage detection. In three of the five endoscopy studies, the 
target population was patients; all five studies obtained good results for 
cost-effectiveness and four observed good results other than for 
cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: In this study, we showed that the H. pylori 
screening test was cost-effective in terms of simulation model investigations. 
However, the H. pylori screening test should not ordinarily be recommended since 
there is insufficient evidence that it reduces gastric cancer mortality. In 
Japan, simulation modeling should be employed to plan for cancer control, and 
the appropriate use of simulation models should be examined for future use.
