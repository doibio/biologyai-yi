Safety-relevant gait situations (walking on stairs and slopes, walking 
backwards, walking with small steps, simulated perturbations of swing phase 
extension) were investigated in a motion analysis laboratory with six unilateral 
transfemoral amputees using two different microprocessor-controlled prosthetic 
knee joints (Rheo Knee XC, C-Leg). A randomized crossover design was chosen. The 
study results imply that the performance and safety potential of a 
microprocessor-controlled knee joint can be associated with the individual 
control algorithms and the technological concepts that are implemented to 
generate motion resistances for controlling flexion and extension movements. 
When walking with small steps, advantages of the "default swing" concept used in 
the Rheo Knee XC were identified due to a highly reproducible swing phase 
release. However, when walking backwards, this concept may lead to an 
uncontrolled knee flexion which partly resulted in falls. When walking down 
stairs, walking on slopes or while recovering from a stumble after perturbations 
of the swing phase extension, the C-Leg demonstrated a reliable prosthetic side 
load-bearing capacity resulting in reduced loading on the residual body. In 
contrast, the Rheo Knee XC required increased compensatory movements of the 
remaining locomotor system in order to compensate for reduced load-bearing and 
safety reserves.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder that is associated with 
serious comorbidities with a negative impact on quality of life, life expectancy 
and health costs. As OSA is related to obesity and is associated with sleep 
disruption, increased inflammation and oxidative stress, it is not surprising 
that OSA has an impact on the secretion of multiple hormones and is implicated 
in the development of many endocrine conditions. On the other hand, many 
endocrine conditions that can affect obesity and/or upper airways anatomy and 
stability have been implicated in the development or worsening of OSA. This 
bidirectional relationship between OSA and the endocrine system has been 
increasingly recognised in experimental and epidemiological studies and there 
are an increasing number of studies examining the effects of OSA treatment on 
endocrine conditions and vice versa. In this review article, we will critically 
appraise and describe the impact of OSA on the endocrine system including 
obesity, dysglycaemia, the pituitary, the thyroid, the adrenals, the 
reproductive system and the bones. In each section, we will assess whether a 
bidirectional relationship exists, and we will describe the potential underlying 
mechanisms. We have focused more on recent studies and randomised controlled 
trials where available and attempted to provide the information within clinical 
context and relevance.

Saeki-ku, Hiroshima, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have identified the risk of polypharmacy, but 
physiological evidence and methods of evaluation in these studies were poor. The 
relationship between polypharmacy and heart rate variability in older adults 
remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between polypharmacy in older 
adults, including atomic bomb survivors, and heart rate variability.
METHODS: We surveyed 56 older adults who did not need nursing care assistance in 
the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Survivors Recuperation Center. Chronic diseases, types 
of medication, and lifestyle were assessed, and heart rate variability at rest 
was measured. We calculated heart rate variability indices including standard 
deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN), total power (TP), and very 
low frequency (VLF) and analyzed the relationship between the number of daily 
medication types and heart rate variability indices in older adults. The 
differences in heart rate variability indices were analyzed using six 
medications as a cut-off point.
RESULTS: Participants included 36 atomic bomb survivors and 20 non-atomic bomb 
survivors. The mean number of medication types was 3.6±3.4 (mean±standard 
deviation). SDNN, TP, and VLF decreased with an increased number of medications 
in all participants (P<0.01). When the standard of polypharmacy was set to more 
than six types of medications, SDNN, TP, and VLF were significantly lower in 
older adults who took six or more medications. Additionally, the mean number of 
medication types among atomic bomb survivors was higher than that of non-atomic 
bomb survivors (P = 0.008). The SDNN was significantly lower when atomic bomb 
survivors took six or more medications (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that a lower heart rate variability in older adults, 
including atomic bomb survivors, is associated with polypharmacy. We showed 
physiological evidence of the influence of polypharmacy, which may be important 
for the healthy life expectancy and prognosis in older adults.

Factors that can influence the survival rates of coral snakes (Micrurus 
corallinus) for antivenom production.

Envenoming and deaths resulting from snakebites are a particularly important 
public health problem in rural tropical areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, 
and New Guinea. In 2015, The Lancet highlighted snake-bite envenoming as a 
neglected tropical disease and urged the world to increase antivenom production. 
In Brazil, around 20,000 snakebites occur per year affecting mostly agricultural 
workers and children, of which 1% is caused by coral snakes (Micrurus sp.). 
Although human envenoming by coral snakes is relatively rare due to their 
semifossorial habits and nonaggressive behavior, they are always considered 
severe due to the neurotoxic, myotoxic, hemorrhagic, and cardiovascular actions 
of their venom, which is highly toxic when compared to the venom of other 
Brazilian venomous snakes as Bothrops sp. (pit vipers), Crotalus sp. 
(rattlesnakes), and Lachesis sp. (bushmasters). The production of antivenom 
serum is an important public health issue worldwide and the maintenance of 
venomous snakes in captivity essential to obtain high-quality venom. Though more 
than 30 species of Brazilian coral snakes exist, the specific antivenom serum 
produced with the venom of two species, Micrurus corallinus and M. frontalis, is 
able to neutralize the accidents caused by the genus in general. M. corallinus 
is considered a difficult species to maintain in captivity and concerned about 
this difficulty the Laboratory of Herpetology (LH) at Instituto Butantan, over 
the last 10 yr, has given special attention to its maintenance in captivity. In 
more than 20 yr of maintenance, LH has made some changes to improve Micrurus 
captive husbandry and welfare. The objective of this study was to verify the 
factors influencing the survival rates of coral snakes in captivity through data 
generated from 289 M. corallinus from the LH snake facility in the last 10 yr. 
We observed that survival rates increased significantly with the improvement of 
nutritional adequacy that included freezing food items before offering them to 
coral snakes, as well as the development of a new pasty diet to force-feed 
anorexic animals. Another important factor responsible for increasing life 
expectancy was the shift of the cage's substrate from Sphagnum to bark in 2010, 
aiding in the eradication of Blister Disease, which used to be responsible for 
the death of several coral snakes in previous years.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease (BoD) using disability-adjusted life years (DALY) 
is a useful summary measure of population health and estimates are provided for 
Ireland annually. We hypothesized that BoD may be used as a predictor of frailty 
prevalence.
AIM: To examine the correlation between frailty measured by the accumulation of 
deficits (frailty index, FI) and Fried frailty phenotype (FFP) classifications 
and BoD, in an Irish context.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional secondary analysis.
METHODS: Data were obtained from waves two and three of The Survey of Health, 
Ageing and Retirement in Europe for Irish adults aged ≥65 in 2007. Frailty was 
defined by a 70-item FI and the FFP. Years lived with disability (YLD), years of 
life lost (YLL) and DALY were calculated using adapted equations from the World 
Health Organization and, where possible, disability weights, sequelae and 
durations as in the Global BoD (GBD) project (2016).
RESULTS: Of 1035 participants, 442 were ≥65 years. Mean DALY were significantly 
higher in those identified as frail (FI: 3.31, P < 0.0001, n = 406; FFP: 2.46, P 
= 0.005, n = 319). For the FI, stronger correlation was found for DALY (r = 
0.5431, P < 0.0001) than for age (r = 0.275, P < 0.0001). Controlling for 
confounders, DALY were an independent predictor of frailty when measured with 
the FI (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10-1.24) but not with the FFP (OR 1.079, 95%% CI 
1.00-1.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty correlates significantly with DALY, and more so with the FI 
than the FFP, reaffirming that these measures are different constructs. GBD data 
could represent a predictor of population-level frailty estimates, facilitating 
improved comparisons.

Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating Agency, Republic of Korea.

AIMS: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of 
telemonitoring for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials and CINAHL up to September 2018. We selected randomised 
controlled trials comparing telemonitoring and control groups for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease management. Two reviewers independently examined 
articles based on eligibility, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. 
The Cochrane tool was applied for assessing the risk of bias. The 95% confidence 
interval was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 28 randomised controlled trials were included. Meta-analysis 
revealed that there were no variables showing a statistically significant 
difference between telemonitoring and control groups. Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease exacerbation rate (six studies) was not different between two 
groups (risk ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.31-1.42). Subgroup analysis 
showed that telemonitoring reduced exacerbation rates when the intervention 
continued for longer than six months or pulmonary function was monitored. No 
differences between groups were noticed for mortality (seven studies, risk ratio 
0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.60-1.34). Similarly, no differences between 
groups were observed in the patient-reported outcomes (St George's Respiratory 
Questionnaire, Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire-Dyspnea score) and for 
health service utilization (length of hospital stay, number of hospital 
admissions, number of emergency room visits).
CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 
unlikely to result in statistically significant improvements in health outcomes. 
However, our novel finding was that at least six months of intervention duration 
and monitoring of pulmonary function play roles in activating the effects of 
telemonitoring.

BACKGROUND: The loss of mobility during aging impacts independence and leads to 
further disability, morbidity, and reduced life expectancy. Our objective was to 
examine the feasibility and safety of conducting a randomized controlled trial 
of yoga for older adults at risk for mobility limitations.
METHODS: Sedentary older adults (n = 46; age 60-89) were recruited and 
randomized to either yoga or a health education comparison group. Yoga sessions 
(60-min) occurred 2x weekly, and 90-min health education sessions occurred 
weekly, for 10 weeks. The primary outcomes were recruitment rate, intervention 
attendance, and retention at assessments. Adverse event rates and participant 
satisfaction were also measured. Physical performance measures of gait, balance, 
and strength and self-report outcome measures were administered at baseline and 
10-weeks.
RESULTS: Recruitment lasted 6 months. Retention of participants at the 10-week 
follow-up was high (89% - performance measures; 98% - self-report 
questionnaires). Attendance was good with 82% of yoga and 74% of health 
education participants attending at least 50% of the sessions. No serious 
adverse events were reported. Patient satisfaction with the interventions was 
high. The mean effect size for the physical performance measures was 0.35 with 
some over 0.50. The mean effect size for self-report outcome measures was 0.36.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that it is feasible to conduct a larger RCT of 
yoga for sedentary older adults at risk for mobility problems. The yoga and 
comparison interventions were safe, well accepted, and well attended. Effect 
sizes suggest yoga may have important benefits for this population and should be 
studied further.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) impact a woman's 
life expectancy and her ability to participate in medical decision-making about 
breast cancer screening, necessitating the involvement of family caregivers. 
Making decisions about mammography screening for women with ADRD is stressful. 
There are no data that suggest that breast cancer screening helps women with 
ADRD live longer or better. Decision aids may improve the quality of 
decision-making about mammography for ADRD patients and may inform family 
caregivers about the risks, benefits, and need for decision-making around 
mammography screening.
METHODS/DESIGN: The Decisions about Cancer Screening in Alzheimer's Disease 
(DECAD) trial, a randomized controlled clinical trial, will enroll 426 dyads of 
older women with ADRD (≥75 years) and a family caregiver from clinics and 
primary-care practices in Indiana to test a novel, evidence-based decision aid. 
This decision aid includes information about the impact of ADRD on life 
expectancy, the benefit of mammograms, and the impact on the quality of life for 
older women with ADRD. Dyads will be randomized to receive the decision aid or 
active control information about home safety. This trial will examine the effect 
on the caregiver's decisional conflict (primary outcome) and the caregiver's 
decision-making self-efficacy (secondary outcome). A second follow-up at 
15 months will include a brief, semi-structured interview with the caregiver 
regarding the patient's experience with mammograms and decision-making about 
mammograms. At the same time, a review of the patient's electronic medical 
record (EMR) will look at discussions about mammography with their primary-care 
physician and mammogram orders, receipt, results, and burden (e.g., additional 
diagnostic procedures due to false-positive results, identification of an 
abnormality on the screening exam but further work-up declined, and 
identification of a clinically unimportant cancer). A third follow-up at 
24 months will extract EMR data on mammogram orders, occurrences, results, and 
the burden of mammograms.
DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that caregivers who receive the decision aid will 
have lower levels of decisional conflict and higher levels of decision-making 
self-efficacy compared to the control group. We also hypothesize that the DECAD 
decision aid will reduce mammography use among older women with ADRD.

ABSTACT: BACKGROUND: Many men diagnosed with prostate cancer are active 
surveillance (AS) candidates. However, AS may be associated with increased risk 
of disease progression and metastasis due to delayed therapy. Genomic 
classifiers, e.g., Decipher, may allow better risk-stratify newly diagnosed 
prostate cancers for AS.
METHODS: Decipher was initially assessed in a prospective cohort of 
prostatectomies to explore the correlation with clinically meaningful biologic 
characteristics and then assessed in diagnostic biopsies from a retrospective 
multicenter cohort of 266 men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
very low/low and favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. Decipher and 
Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) were compared as predictors of 
adverse pathology (AP) for which there is universal agreement that patients with 
long life-expectancy are not suitable candidates for AS (primary pattern 4 or 5, 
advanced local stage [pT3b or greater] or lymph node involvement).
RESULTS: Decipher from prostatectomies was significantly associated with adverse 
pathologic features (p-values < 0.001). Decipher from the 266 diagnostic 
biopsies (64.7% NCCN-very-low/low and 35.3% favorable-intermediate) was an 
independent predictor of AP (odds ratio 1.29 per 10% increase, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.03-1.61, p-value 0.025) when adjusting for CAPRA. CAPRA area 
under curve (AUC) was 0.57, (95% CI 0.47-0.68). Adding Decipher to CAPRA 
increased the AUC to 0.65 (95% CI 0.58-0.70). NPV, which determines the degree 
of confidence in the absence of AP for patients, was 91% (95% CI 87-94%) and 96% 
(95% CI 90-99%) for Decipher thresholds of 0.45 and 0.2, respectively. Using a 
threshold of 0.2, Decipher was a significant predictor of AP when adjusting for 
CAPRA (p-value 0.016).
CONCLUSION: Decipher can be applied to prostate biopsies from NCCN-very-low/low 
and favorable-intermediate risk patients to predict absence of adverse 
pathologic features. These patients are predicted to be good candidates for 
active surveillance.

Evidence indicating Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL) delivers significant 
improvement in symptomatic BPH with low morbidity is based on subjects with 
lateral lobe (LL) enlargement only. MedLift was an FDA IDE extension of the 
L.I.F.T. randomized study designed to examine safety and efficacy of PUL for 
treatment of obstructive middle lobes (OML). Inclusion criteria for this 
non-randomized cohort were identical to the L.I.F.T. randomized study, except 
for requiring an OML: ≥ 50 years of age, IPSS ≥ 13, and Qmax ≤ 12 ml/s. Primary 
endpoint analysis quantified improvement in IPSS over baseline and rate of 
post-procedure serious complications. Quantification of symptom relief, quality 
of life, flow rate, and sexual function occurred through 12 months. Outcomes 
were compared to historical L.I.F.T LL results and were combined to demonstrate 
the full effectiveness of PUL. Of the 71 screened subjects, 45 were enrolled. At 
1, 3, 6, and 12 months, mean IPSS improved from baseline at least 13.5 points 
(p < 0.0001). Quality of life and BPHII were similarly improved (>60% and >70%, 
respectively at 3, 6, and 12 months, p < 0.0001). Mean Qmax improvement ranged 
from 90 to 129% (p < 0.0001). At 1 month, 86% (CI 73-94%) reported ≥70 on the 
Quality of Recovery scale, 80% (CI 66-89%) reported being "much" or "very much 
better," and 89% (CI 76-95%) would recommend the procedure. Compared to LL 
subjects, OML subjects' symptoms improved at least as much at every time point 
(OML range 13.5-15.9, LL range 9.9-11.1, p ≤ 0.01). On combining OML with LL 
data, >70% (range CI 63-81%) of subjects demonstrated ≥ 8 point improvement in 
IPSS through 12 months. Analysis of the combined dataset indicates ≥ 40% (CI 
30-51%) of sexually active men improved the minimal clinically important 
difference in erectile function through 12 months. Prostates, including those 
with middle lobe obstruction, can be treated with the PUL procedure safely and 
effectively.

PURPOSE: Gynaecological cancer management in older people represents a current 
challenge. Therefore, in the present paper, we aimed to gather all the evidence 
reported in the literature concerning gynecological cancers in the elderly, 
illustrating the state of art and the future perspectives.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, IBECS, BIOSIS, Web of Science, SCOPUS and Grey literature 
(Google Scholar; British Library) from January 1952 to May 2017, using the terms 
"ovarian cancer", "endometrial cancer", "cervical cancer", "gynecological 
cancers" combined with 'elderly', 'cancer', 'clinical trial' and 'geriatric 
assessment'.
RESULTS: The search identified 81 citations, of which 65 were potentially 
relevant after initial evaluation and met the criteria for inclusion and were 
analyzed. We divided all included studies into three different issue: 
"Endometrial cancer", "Ovarian cancer" and "Cervical cancer".
CONCLUSIONS: The present literature review shows that, in spite of the higher 
burden of comorbidities, elderly patients can also benefit from standard 
treatment to manage their gynecological cancers. It is important to overcome the 
common habit of undertreating the elderly patients because they are more fragile 
and with a lower life expectancy than their younger counterpart. Further trials 
with elderly women are warranted.

Cost of Cancer: Healthcare Expenditures and Economic Impact.

Jönsson B(1).

(1), Stockholm, Sweden. Bengt.Jonsson@hhs.se.

Healthcare expenditures for cancer account for a low share of total healthcare 
expenditures, compared to the relative burden of the disease. The share has also 
not changed very much over the last decades. Cost for cancer drugs has increased 
as a share of total expenditures, but this has been offset by a reduction of 
inpatient hospital care for cancer. Accounting for the cost of cancer should not 
be limited to healthcare expenditures. Resources are also used for public and 
private care of cancer patients outside the healthcare sector, for example for 
palliative care. Informal care by family and friends is an important complement 
to professional care, and estimates indicate that this amounts to between half 
and one-third of the costs of formal care. Indirect costs related to the loss of 
production for persons with cancer are estimated to be of the same magnitude as 
the direct healthcare expenditures. Indirect costs related to premature 
mortality dominate the estimate of indirect costs, but those costs have declined 
over time, despite increasing incomes, due to the reduction in mortality due to 
cancer in the economically active age groups. Estimates of indirect costs due to 
morbidity are uncertain and vary significantly between published studies. A full 
accounting of the costs of cancer should include an estimate of the health 
burden of cancer. Loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) can be 
measured and valued based on the willingness to pay for a QALY. Such estimates 
are possible to derive from decisions about allocating resources for cancer. 
There are few estimates of these costs, but available studies indicate that the 
intangible costs of lost QALY are by far the dominating cost of cancer. The 
value for policy-making of costs of cancer estimates increases when results with 
consistent methods and data are available that allow comparisons between 
countries and over time. The evidence about the cost of cancer is still limited, 
but when current scientific progress produces an increasing number of new 
options for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, studies of the cost of cancer 
become increasingly important to inform decisions about resource allocation.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal 
aortic aneurysm (AAA) is less invasive than open surgery, but may be associated 
with important complications. Patients receiving EVAR require long-term 
surveillance to detect abnormalities and direct treatments. Computed tomography 
angiography (CTA) has been the most common imaging modality adopted for EVAR 
surveillance, but it is associated with repeated radiation exposure and the risk 
of contrast-related nephropathy. Colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) and, more 
recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) have been suggested as possible, 
safer, alternatives to CTA.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
imaging strategies, using either CDU or CEU alone or in conjunction with plain 
radiography, compared with CTA for EVAR surveillance.
DATA SOURCES: Major electronic databases were searched, including MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, Science Citation Index, Scopus' Articles-in-Press, Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of 
Effects (DARE) and NHS Economic Evaluation Database from 1996 onwards. We also 
searched for relevant ongoing studies and conference proceedings. The final 
searches were undertaken in September 2016.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and 
cohort studies of patients with AAAs who were receiving surveillance using CTA, 
CDU and CEU with or without plain radiography. Three reviewers were involved in 
the study selection, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment. We developed a 
Markov model based on five surveillance strategies: (1) annual CTA; (2) annual 
CDU; (3) annual CEU; (4) CDU together with CTA at 1 year, followed by CDU on an 
annual basis; and (5) CEU together with CTA at 1 year, followed by CEU on an 
annual basis. All of these strategies also considered plain radiography on an 
annual basis.
RESULTS: We identified two non-randomised comparative studies and 25 cohort 
studies of interventions, and nine systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy. 
Overall, the proportion of patients who required reintervention ranged from 1.1% 
(mean follow-up of 24 months) to 23.8% (mean follow-up of 32 months). 
Reintervention was mainly required for patients with thrombosis and types I-III 
endoleaks. All-cause mortality ranged from 2.7% (mean follow-up of 24 months) to 
42% (mean follow-up of 54.8 months). Aneurysm-related mortality occurred in < 1% 
of the participants. Strategies based on early and mid-term CTA and/or CDU and 
long-term CDU surveillance were broadly comparable with those based on a 
combination of CTA and CDU throughout the follow-up period in terms of clinical 
complications, reinterventions and mortality. The economic evaluation showed 
that a CDU-based strategy generated lower expected costs and higher 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALYs) than a CTA-based strategy and has a 63% 
probability of being cost-effective at a £30,000 willingness-to-pay-per-QALY 
threshold. A CEU-based strategy generated more QALYs, but at higher costs, and 
became cost-effective only for high-risk patient groups.
LIMITATIONS: Most studies were rated as being at a high or moderate risk of 
bias. No studies compared CDU with CEU. Substantial clinical heterogeneity 
precluded a formal synthesis of results. The economic model was hindered by a 
lack of suitable data.
CONCLUSIONS: Current surveillance practice is very heterogeneous. CDU may be a 
safe and cost-effective alternative to CTA, with CTA being reserved for 
abnormal/inconclusive CDU cases.
FUTURE WORK: Research is needed to validate the safety of modified, 
more-targeted surveillance protocols based on the use of CDU and CEU. The role 
of radiography for surveillance after EVAR requires clarification.

IMPORTANCE: In early 2018, durvalumab became the first immunotherapy to be 
approved for adjuvant treatment of patients with unresectable stage III 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose cancer has not progressed after 
definitive chemoradiotherapy. However, the cost-effectiveness and potential 
economic implications of using this high-priced therapy in this indication are 
unknown to date.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the cost-effectiveness and potential budgetary 
consequences of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation therapy 
after chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC in the context of the US health care 
system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A decision analytic microsimulation model was 
developed in an academic medical setting to compare the following 2 
postchemoradiotherapy strategies: all patients receive no consolidation therapy 
until progression vs all patients receive durvalumab consolidation therapy until 
progression or for a maximum of 1 year. The potential budgetary consequence was 
calculated by applying the proportion of patients with NSCLC who were diagnosed 
in stage III and received chemoradiotherapy to the projected number of annual 
new cases for 2018 to 2022 to find total eligible patients and then multiplied 
by the mean difference in annual cost between the strategies over this 5-year 
period. Simulated conditions were matched to those of the PACIFIC phase 3 
randomized clinical trial and reasonable treatment strategies for metastatic 
NSCLC. All simulated patients begin disease free after having received radical 
treatment with chemoradiotherapy and are followed up as they progress to 
metastatic disease first-line treatment, metastatic disease second-line 
treatment, end-stage progressive disease, and death.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome of this study was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation 
therapy, given as aggregate cost of treatment per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained.
RESULTS: Among 2 million simulated patients, durvalumab consolidation therapy 
was cost-effective compared with no consolidation therapy at a $100 000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year willingness-to-pay threshold, with an estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $67 421 per quality-adjusted life-year, 
and would contribute an additional $768 million to national cancer spending in 
year 1. The annual budgetary consequence would then decrease to $241 million in 
year 5.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Durvalumab consolidation therapy represents an 
indication where expensive immunotherapies can be cost-effective. Treating with 
immunotherapy earlier in the course of cancer progression can provide 
significant value, despite having a substantial budgetary consequence.

IMPORTANCE: Across many countries, a rapid escalation of the incidence of 
thyroid cancer has been observed, a surge that nonetheless underestimates the 
true extent of the disease. Most thyroid cancers now diagnosed comprise small, 
low-risk cancers that are incidentally found and are unlikely to cause harm. In 
many ways, prostate cancer similarly harbors a well-behaved subclinical 
reservoir, a long natural history, and superlative outcomes that have made 
active surveillance the de facto guideline recommendation for low-risk disease. 
This review highlights the parallels and differences between prostate cancer and 
thyroid cancer regarding screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and 
considerations for active surveillance.
OBSERVATIONS: Prostate cancer and thyroid cancer have undergone recalibrated, 
de-escalatory shifts to counter changing epidemiologic landscapes. The US 
Preventive Services Task Force has issued cautionary recommendations on 
screening via prostate-specific antigen testing or neck ultrasonography, while 
the thresholds to performing biopsy have increased. Comparable changes to cancer 
terminology and staging have also helped alleviate patient anxiety and minimize 
pressure for overtreatment. Long-term, randomized prospective clinical trials 
for prostate cancer have established active surveillance as a first-line 
treatment approach for properly stratified low-risk patients, while 
observational trials for thyroid cancer have also made strides in defining risk 
and eligibility for surgery. Caveats requiring deeper investigation include 
aggressive disease in older patients, underestimation of the extent of the 
disease, and patient-physician bias in shared decision making. For prostate 
cancer, survival may not improve and function will likely worsen after 
intervention; for thyroid cancer, patients are younger, surgery is safer, and 
the bar for surveillance will likely be higher.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite similarities in biological indolence between 
low-risk prostate and thyroid malignant neoplasms, key distinctions in life 
expectancy and treatment sequelae may ultimately confer somewhat disparate 
management paradigms for the 2 diseases. Nevertheless, the experience forged by 
prostate cancer trials serves as a model for thyroid cancer management, 
potentially reshaping the perception of active surveillance into a credible, 
valuable treatment modality.

Peptide hormone relaxin-2, a member of the insulin family of peptides, plays a 
key role in hemodynamics and renal function and has shown preclinical efficacy 
in multiple disease models, including acute heart failure, fibrosis, 
preeclampsia, and corneal wound healing. Recently, serelaxin, a recombinant 
version of relaxin-2, has been studied in a large phase 3 clinical trial 
(RELAX-AHF-2) for acute decompensated heart failure patients with disappointing 
outcome. The poor in vivo half-life of relaxin-2 may have limited its 
therapeutic efficacy and long-term cardiovascular benefit. Herein, we have 
developed a semisynthetic methodology and generated potent, fatty 
acid-conjugated relaxin analogs with long-acting pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in 
rodents. The enhanced PK properties translated into improved and long-lasting 
pharmacodynamic effect in pubic ligament elongation (PLE) studies. The resultant 
novel relaxin analog, R9-13, represents the first long-acting relaxin-2 analog 
and could potentially improve the clinical efficacy and outcome for this 
important peptide hormone. This semisynthetic methodology could also be applied 
to other cysteine-rich peptides and proteins for half-life extension.

BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, chronic, progressive, granulomatous 
disease. Sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary hypertension is a well described, but 
not common, complication of sarcoidosis. In small scale studies, it has been 
previously described as manifestation of advanced disease and was found to be 
associated increased morbidity and mortality. This study sought to assess the 
long-term prognostic significance of sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary 
hypertension (SAPH) by using data obtained from a large population-based 
registry which contains longitudinal follow-up data.
METHODS: Utilizing the records of the largest healthcare provider in Israel, we 
extracted a cohort consisting of sarcoidosis patients and age-and-sex matched 
controls. Dates of sarcoidosis registration, pulmonary hypertension and death, 
as well as anthropometric information and medical comorbidities, were extracted 
from the database. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to find 
variables associated with pulmonary hypertension. Cox proportional hazards 
method and log-rank test were used for survival analysis.
RESULTS: The cohort included 3993 sarcoidosis patients and 19,856 controls. 
Pulmonary hypertension was observed among 269 sarcoidosis patients (6.74%) vs. 
400 controls (2.01%). Sarcoidosis was found as independently associated with 
pulmonary hypertension (OR 3.17). After a mean follow-up of 7.49 years (median 
7.24, maximum 17.88 years), 710 (17.8%) of the sarcoidosis patients and 2121 
(10.7%) of the controls had died. Both sarcoidosis and pulmonary hypertension 
were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause 
mortality (HR 1.82 and HR 2.31, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: SAPH is associated with a poor prognosis. Proper screening methods 
may assess whether early identification and treatment improve life expectancy.
