Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in 
the elderly population, with a higher prevalence in men, independent of race and 
social class; it affects approximately 1.5 to 2.0% of the elderly population 
over 60 years and 4% for those over 80 years of age. PD is caused by the 
necrosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which is the brain 
region responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), 
resulting in its decrease in the synaptic cleft. The monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) 
degrades dopamine, promoting the glutamate accumulation and oxidative stress 
with the release of free radicals, causing excitotoxicity. The PD symptoms are 
progressive physical limitations such as rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, 
postural instability and disability in functional performance. Considering that 
there are no laboratory tests, biomarkers or imaging studies to confirm the 
disease, the diagnosis of PD is made by analyzing the motor features. There is 
no cure for PD, and the pharmacological treatment consists of a dopaminergic 
supplement with levodopa, COMT inhibitors, anticholinergics agents, dopaminergic 
agonists, and inhibitors of MAO-B, which basically aims to control the symptoms, 
enabling better functional mobility and increasing life expectancy of the 
treated PD patients. Due to the importance and increasing prevalence of PD in 
the world, this study reviews information on the pathophysiology, symptomatology 
as well as the most current and relevant treatments of PD patients.

BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a serious antimicrobial 
resistant threat in the healthcare setting. We assessed the cost-effectiveness 
of VRE screening and isolation for patients at high-risk for colonisation on a 
general medicine ward compared to no VRE screening and isolation from the 
healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model using local data and VRE 
literature, to simulate a 20-bed general medicine ward at a tertiary-care 
hospital with up to 1000 admissions, approximating 1 year. Primary outcomes were 
accrued over the patient's lifetime, discounted at 1.5%, and included expected 
health outcomes (VRE colonisations, VRE infections, VRE-related bacteremia, and 
deaths subsequent to VRE infection), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
healthcare costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) and scenario analyses were conducted to assess 
parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: In our base-case analysis, VRE screening and isolation prevented six 
healthcare-associated VRE colonisations per 1000 admissions (6/1000), 0.6/1000 
VRE-related infections, 0.2/1000 VRE-related bacteremia, and 0.1/1000 deaths 
subsequent to VRE infection. VRE screening and isolation accrued 0.0142 
incremental QALYs at an incremental cost of $112, affording an ICER of $7850 per 
QALY. VRE screening and isolation practice was more likely to be cost-effective 
(> 50%) at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY. Stochasticity 
(randomness) had a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: VRE screening and isolation can be cost-effective in majority of 
model simulations at commonly used cost-effectiveness thresholds, and is likely 
economically attractive in general medicine settings. Our findings strengthen 
the understanding of VRE prevention strategies and are of importance to hospital 
program planners and infection prevention and control.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) affects almost everyone at least once in their 
lifetime. Various meta-analyses show promising effects on pain reduction for 
conventional exercise. However, the lack of time and, especially for pain 
patients, a fear of movement ("kinesiophobia") as well as functional limitations 
often oppose participation in such activities. In contrast, the advantage of 
novel training technologies like whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) lies 
particularly in a joint-friendly, time-effective, and highly customized training 
protocol and might be an alternative option for LBP patients. A meta-analysis of 
individual patient data and a comparison of WB-EMS against a passive control 
group confirmed the proof principle. Thus, the aim of this randomized controlled 
trial is to compare WB-EMS with a recognized back-strengthening exercise 
protocol to determine the corresponding effects on chronic, nonspecific LBP in 
people suffering from this.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This randomized, controlled multicenter study is focused 
on novel and time-effective training technologies and LBP. In this contribution, 
the focus is primarily on the comparison of WB-EMS against a comparable 
conventional exercise training (CT). One hundred ten nonspecific chronic LBP 
patients, 40-70 years old, were randomly allocated to the intervention arms 
(WB-EMS: 55 vs. CT: 55). Both groups completed a 12-week program (WB-EMS: 
1 × 20 min/week vs. CT: 1 × 45 min/week) specifically dedicated to LBP. The 
selection of the content of the active control group was based on the principles 
of WB-EMS training, which uses electrical stimulation to train mainly strength 
and stabilization in a very short time. Exercises were similar in all groups, 
with the focus on strengthening and stabilizing the trunk. Outcome measures were 
assessed by a four-week pain diary (before and during the last four weeks of 
intervention) as well as an isometric maximum strength measurement of the trunk 
muscles at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention. Primary study endpoint 
was average pain intensity at the lumbar spine. Secondary study endpoints were 
maximum isometric strength of the back and the abdominals. The mean pain 
intensity of LBP decreased significantly in both groups (WB-EMS: -22.3 ± 20.9% 
vs. CT: -30.2 ± 43.9%; p < 0.001), however, without significant intergroup 
difference (p=0.160). A similar result was observed for "maximum isometric 
strength of trunk muscles." The increase in back strength (WB-EMS: 15.6 ± 24.9% 
vs. CT: 23.0 ± 30.9%) was highly significant in both groups (p=0.001), and 
similar changes were observed for the trunk flexors (WB-EMS: 17.6 ± 24.8% vs. 
CT: 18.1 ± 24.8%). Also, at the secondary endpoint, no significant difference in 
pairwise comparison was observed in both cases (extension: p=0.297; flexion: 
p=0.707).
CONCLUSION: In summary, both, WB-EMS and conventional back-strengthening 
protocol are comparably effective in reducing nonspecific chronic LBP in this 
dedicated cohort. The result is particularly positive in terms of time 
effectiveness and offers an adequate alternative for people with limited time 
resources or other barriers to conventional training methods.

Aims: This article aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban in 
comparison to warfarin for stroke prevention in Japanese patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), from a public healthcare payer's 
perspective.Materials and methods: Baseline event risks were obtained from the 
J-ROCKET AF trial and the treatment effect data were taken from a network 
meta-analysis. The other model inputs were extracted from the literature and 
official Japanese sources. The outcomes included the number of ischaemic 
strokes, myocardial infarctions, systemic embolisms and bleedings avoided, 
life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental costs and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The scenario analysis considered 
treatment effect data from the same network meta-analysis.Results: In comparison 
with warfarin, rivaroxaban was estimated to avoid 0.284 ischaemic strokes per 
patient, to increase the number of QALYs by 0.535 per patient and to decrease 
the total costs by ¥118,892 (€1,011.11) per patient (1 JPY = 0.00850638 EUR; 
XE.com, 7 October 2019). Consequently, rivaroxaban treatment was found to be 
dominant compared to warfarin. In the scenario analysis, the ICER of rivaroxaban 
versus warfarin was ¥2,873,499 (€24,446.42) per QALY.Limitations: The various 
sources of data used resulted in the heterogeneity of the cost-effectiveness 
analysis results. Although, rivaroxaban was cost-effective in the majority of 
cases.Conclusion: Rivaroxaban is cost-effective against warfarin for stroke 
prevention in Japanese patients with NVAF, giving the payer WTP of 5,000,000 
JPY.

OBJECTIVES: In contrast with other developed nations, life expectancy is 
decreasing in the United States, in part due to increasing mortality from 
alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Up-to-date estimates of ALD mortality 
are necessary for setting public health priorities to reverse this concerning 
trend. We therefore aimed to assess current (2017) estimates of ALD mortality 
and temporal trends from 1999 to 2017.
METHODS: Using national data from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, we analyzed stratified ALD mortality rates between 1999 and 2017. We 
determined the age-adjusted death rates, stratified by sex and categorized by 
age, race/ethnicity, urbanization, and census region. We also identified 
statistically significant changes in the annual rate difference (ARD), annual 
percentage change (APC), and average APC in ALD mortality.
RESULTS: In 2017, mortality from ALD was higher than any other year since 1999 
with age-adjusted rates of 13.1 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
12.9-13.3) in men and 5.6 per 100,000 (95% CI 5.4-5.7) in women. Mortality was 
highest among men and women who were middle aged, Native American, and from 
rural areas. Since 2006, ALD mortality has increased in almost every age group 
and race with the exception of non-Hispanic black men. Absolute increases in 
mortality rates have been particularly pronounced in Native American women 
(2005-2017 ARD 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-0.9), non-Hispanic/white men (2006-2017 ARD 0.4, 
95% CI 0.3-0.4), and non-Hispanic/white women (2013-2017 ARD 0.4, 95% CI 
0.3-0.5).
DISCUSSION: Mortality from ALD is increasing over time in most demographic 
groups. Increased effort is needed to develop targeted public health strategies 
to address high and increasing ALD mortality.

Surgery, University of Ottawa.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the economic impact of 
complete decongestive therapy and lymphovenous bypass in the management of upper 
extremity lymphedema.
METHODS: Economics were modeled for a patient with breast cancer-related 
lymphedema undergoing three different clinical pathways: (1) complete 
decongestive therapy alone; (2) lymphovenous bypass no longer requiring ongoing 
complete decongestive therapy; or (3) lymphovenous bypass requiring ongoing 
complete decongestive therapy. Activity-based cost analysis identified costs 
incurred with complete decongestive therapy and lymphovenous bypass. Costs were 
retrieved from supplier price lists, physician fee schedules, lymphedema 
therapists, and literature reviews. The net present value of all costs incurred 
for each clinical pathway were calculated.
RESULTS: The estimated net present value of all costs for a patient with breast 
cancer-related lymphedema undergoing treatment were as follows: (1) complete 
decongestive therapy alone ($30,400); (2) lymphovenous bypass no longer 
requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($15,000); or (3) lymphovenous 
bypass requiring ongoing complete decongestive therapy ($42,100). The expected 
net present value of all costs for lymphovenous bypass was $26,800, which was 
comparable to that of complete decongestive therapy alone. Sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that the expected net present value of lymphovenous bypass was 
dependent on the patient's life expectancy, number of bypass anastomoses, and 
likelihood of discontinuing complete decongestive therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphedema has substantial ongoing costs irrespective of the 
treatment modality. The cost of lymphovenous bypass appears comparable to that 
of complete decongestive therapy alone-the surgical costs of lymphovenous bypass 
are offset by the savings from discontinued ongoing therapy. Despite its 
limitations as a theoretical economic model, this study provides insight into 
the potential economic impact of lymphovenous bypass.

Diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors have been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of several chronic diseases, but also in a lower total mortality 
and longer life expectancy. One of the mechanisms in which diet can reduce the 
risk of disease is with regard to its impact on telomeres. Telomere length (TL) 
is highly correlated to chronological age and metabolic status. Individuals with 
shorter telomeres are at higher risk of chronic diseases and mortality. Diet may 
influence TL by several mechanisms such as regulating oxidative stress and 
inflammation or modulating epigenetic reactions. The present systematic review 
aims to examine the results from epidemiologic and clinical trials conducted in 
humans evaluating the role of nutrients, food groups, and dietary patterns on 
TL. We also discuss the possible mechanisms of action that influence this 
process, with the perspective that TL could be a novel biomarker indicating the 
risk of metabolic disturbances and age-related diseases. The available evidence 
suggests that some antioxidant nutrients, the consumption of fruits and 
vegetables, and Mediterranean diet are mainly associated with longer telomeres. 
However, most of the evidence is based on high heterogenic observational studies 
and very few randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Therefore, the associations 
summarized in the present review need to be confirmed with larger prospective 
cohort studies and better-designed RCTs.

Erratum in
    Brain. 2020 Feb 1;143(2):e16.

Ohtahara syndrome, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with a suppression 
burst EEG pattern, is an aetiologically heterogeneous condition starting in the 
first weeks or months of life with intractable seizures and profound 
developmental disability. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified biallelic 
DMXL2 mutations in three sibling pairs with Ohtahara syndrome, belonging to 
three unrelated families. Siblings in Family 1 were compound heterozygous for 
the c.5135C>T (p.Ala1712Val) missense substitution and the c.4478C>G 
(p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution; in Family 2 were homozygous for the 
c.4478C>A (p.Ser1493*) nonsense substitution and in Family 3 were homozygous for 
the c.7518-1G>A (p.Trp2507Argfs*4) substitution. The severe developmental and 
epileptic encephalopathy manifested from the first day of life and was 
associated with deafness, mild peripheral polyneuropathy and dysmorphic 
features. Early brain MRI investigations in the first months of life revealed 
thin corpus callosum with brain hypomyelination in all. Follow-up MRI scans in 
three patients revealed progressive moderate brain shrinkage with 
leukoencephalopathy. Five patients died within the first 9 years of life and 
none achieved developmental, communicative or motor skills following birth. 
These clinical findings are consistent with a developmental brain disorder that 
begins in the prenatal brain, prevents neural connections from reaching the 
expected stages at birth, and follows a progressive course. DMXL2 is highly 
expressed in the brain and at synaptic terminals, regulates v-ATPase assembly 
and activity and participates in intracellular signalling pathways; however, its 
functional role is far from complete elucidation. Expression analysis in 
patient-derived skin fibroblasts demonstrated absence of the DMXL2 protein, 
revealing a loss of function phenotype. Patients' fibroblasts also exhibited an 
increased LysoTracker® signal associated with decreased endolysosomal markers 
and degradative processes. Defective endolysosomal homeostasis was accompanied 
by impaired autophagy, revealed by lower LC3II signal, accumulation of 
polyubiquitinated proteins, and autophagy receptor p62, with morphological 
alterations of the autolysosomal structures on electron microscopy. Altered 
lysosomal homeostasis and defective autophagy were recapitulated in 
Dmxl2-silenced mouse hippocampal neurons, which exhibited impaired neurite 
elongation and synaptic loss. Impaired lysosomal function and autophagy caused 
by biallelic DMXL2 mutations affect neuronal development and synapse formation 
and result in Ohtahara syndrome with profound developmental impairment and 
reduced life expectancy.

Rationale: Recent tuberculosis treatment trials failed to show that some 4-month 
(4m) regimens were noninferior to conventional 6-month (6m) regimens for a 
composite clinical outcome. Novel shortened regimens may still have important 
clinical and economic benefits in populations with high loss to follow-up (LTFU) 
and in subgroups such as people with human immunodeficiency virus.Objectives: To 
identify scenarios in which a novel 4m regimen would be preferred to a 
conventional 6m regimen for treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis in people 
with human immunodeficiency virus in South Africa, in terms of short-term and 
long-term clinical and economic outcomes.Methods: We used the Cost-Effectiveness 
of Preventing AIDS Complications-International microsimulation model to project 
outcomes modeled on participants in the OFLOTUB trial. For calibration purposes, 
we did a base case analysis by applying trial-informed parameters for the 4m/6m 
regimens, including monthly LTFU during treatment (0.68%/0.83%), average monthly 
tuberculosis recurrence (0.65%/0.31%), and monthly drug costs (U.S. dollars 
[USD]25.90/3.70). We then evaluated different scenarios and 4m regimen 
characteristics, varying key parameters, including LTFU (informed by 
observational cohort data), recurrence, and cost. We projected outcomes, 
including 2-year mortality and life expectancy. We conducted a 
cost-effectiveness analysis, evaluating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of a 4m versus 6m regimen.Results: In the base case model analysis, risk of the 
composite unfavorable outcome in the 4m/6m groups was 19.8%/15.9%, similar to 
the trial; projected life expectancies were 22.1/22.3 years. In analyses of 
alternative scenarios and 4m regimen characteristics, a 4m regimen yielded lower 
risk of the composite unfavorable outcome than the conventional 6m regimen if 
LTFU increased to greater than 3.5%/mo or if average recurrence after a 4m 
regimen decreased to less than 0.45%/mo, and it yielded higher life expectancy 
if LTFU was greater than 3.5%/mo or if recurrence was less than 0.5%/mo. A 4m 
regimen was not cost-effective in the base case but became cost-effective 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <USD940/yr of life saved) in two-way 
sensitivity analysis; for example, if LTFU was greater than or equal to 5.3%/mo 
and either average recurrence was less than or equal to 0.5%/mo or drug cost was 
less than or equal to USD15/mo.Conclusions: A novel shortened tuberculosis 
treatment regimen could improve outcomes such as survival despite conferring a 
higher recurrence risk, particularly in settings where LTFU is higher than that 
seen in recent trials.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an updated overview of prognostic models in 
advanced cancer and highlight the role of prognostic calculators.
RECENT FINDINGS: In the advanced cancer setting, many important healthcare 
decisions are driven by a patient's prognosis. However, there is much 
uncertainty in formulating prognosis, particularly in the era of novel cancer 
therapeutics. Multiple prognostic models have been validated for patients seen 
by palliative care and have a life expectancy of a few months or less, such as 
the Palliative Performance Scale, Palliative Prognostic Score, Palliative 
Prognostic Index, Objective Prognostic Score, and Prognosis in Palliative Care 
Study Predictor. However, these models are seldom used in clinical practice 
because of challenges related to limited accuracy when applied individually and 
difficulties with model selection, computation, and interpretation. Online 
prognostic calculators emerge as tools to facilitate knowledge translation by 
overcoming the above challenges. For example, www.predictsurvival.com provides 
the output for seven prognostic indexes simultaneously based on 11 variables.
SUMMARY: Prognostic models and prognostic websites are currently available to 
augment prognostication in the advanced cancer setting. Further studies are 
needed to examine their impact on prognostic accuracy, confidence, and clinical 
outcomes.

In contrast to earlier studies which have used modelling to perform 
cost-effectiveness analysis, this study links data from a randomised controlled 
trial with register data from nationwide registries to reveal new evidence on 
costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of organised mass prostate-cancer 
screening based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Cost-effectiveness 
analyses were conducted with individual-level data on health-care costs from 
comprehensive registers and register data on real-world effectiveness from the 
two arms of the Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer 
(FinRSPC), following 80,149 men from 1996 through 2015. The study examines 
cost-effectiveness in terms of overall mortality and, in addition, in terms of 
diagnosed men's mortality from prostate cancer and mortality with but not from 
prostate cancer. Neither arm of the FinRSPC was clearly more cost-effective in 
analysis in terms of overall mortality. Organised screening in the FinRSPC could 
be considered cost-effective in terms of deaths from prostate cancer: averting 
just over one death per 1000 men screened. However, even with an estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of below 20,000€ per death avoided, this 
result should not be considered in isolation. This is because mass screening in 
this trial also resulted in increases in death with, but not from, prostate 
cancer: with over five additional deaths per 1000 men screened. Analysis of 
real-world data from the FinRSPC reveals new evidence of the comparative 
effectiveness of PSA-based screening after 20 years of follow-up, suggesting the 
possibility of higher mortality, as well as higher healthcare costs, for 
screening-arm men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer but who do not 
die from it. These findings should be corroborated or contradicted by similar 
analyses using data from other trials, in order to reveal if more diagnosed men 
have also died in the screening arms of other trials of mass screening for 
prostate cancer.

Failure to awaken from general anesthesia due to infratentorial hemorrhage after 
cervical spine surgery: A case report.

Author information:

Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea.

RATIONALE: Emergence is not simply the reverse process of induction. Many 
dynamic situations could occur in this period by distinct neurobiology as recent 
studies indicated. Herein we report a rare case of failure of emergence from 
general anesthesia after cervical spine surgery.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Despite the perioperative vital signs and laboratory results 
were unremarkable, the patient could not recover his mental status and 
spontaneous breathing during emergence. 20 minutes after cessation of anesthetic 
drug administration, his blood pressure suddenly began to decrease requiring 
transfusion and vasopressor.
DIAGNOSIS: After thorough inspection of intraoperative alterations of 
hemodynamic and metabolic values, which showed no significant changes except 
possible signs of delayed volume loss, cerebrovascular bleeding was most 
suspected as the cause of the event. Computed tomography was performed and 
infratentorial hemorrhage after cervical spine surgery was checked.
INTERVENTIONS: Decompression operation was required for removing the hemorrhage. 
However, the patient's family refused further management considering his limited 
life expectancy.
OUTCOMES: The patient expired on postoperative day 5.
LESSONS: Failure to awaken is a relatively rare event. It could be confused with 
simple delayed emergence, which is often caused by residual drug effect. 
However, when it occurs, the result could be devastating. Therefore, appropriate 
recognition and prompt response are required to decrease the mortality and 
morbidity of the patient.

The past two centuries have witnessed an unprecedented rise in human life 
expectancy. Sustaining longer lives with reduced periods of disability will 
require an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ageing, and genetics is 
a powerful tool for identifying these mechanisms. Large-scale genome-wide 
association studies have recently identified many loci that influence key human 
ageing traits, including lifespan. Multi-trait loci have been linked with 
several age-related diseases, suggesting shared ageing influences. Mutations 
that drive accelerated ageing in prototypical progeria syndromes in humans point 
to an important role for genome maintenance and stability. Together, these 
different strands of genetic research are highlighting pathways for the 
discovery of anti-ageing interventions that may be applicable in humans.

BACKGROUND: Despite our inability to accurately predict survival in many cancer 
patients, a life expectancy of at least 3 mo is historically necessary to be 
considered for surgical treatment of spinal metastases.
OBJECTIVE: To compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients 
surviving <3 mo after surgical treatment to patients surviving >3 mo to assess 
the validity of this inclusion criteria.
METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for spinal metastases between August 
2013 and May 2017 were retrospectively identified from an international cohort 
study. HRQOL was evaluated using generic and disease-specific outcome tools at 
baseline and at 6 and 12 wk postsurgery. The primary outcome was the HRQOL at 6 
wk post-treatment measured by the Spine Oncology Study Group Outcomes 
Questionnaire (SOSGOQ).
RESULTS: A total of 253 patients were included: 40 patients died within the 
first 3 mo after surgery and 213 patients survived more than 3 mo. Patients 
surviving <3 mo after surgery presented with lower baseline performance status. 
Adjusted analyses for baseline performance status did not reveal a significant 
difference in HRQOL between both groups at 6 wk post-treatment. No significant 
difference in patient satisfaction at 6 wk with regard to their treatment could 
be detected between both groups.
CONCLUSION: When controlled for baseline performance status, quality of life 6 
wk after surgery for spinal metastasis is independent of survival. To optimize 
improvement in HRQOL for this patient population, baseline performance status 
should take priority over expected survival in the surgical decision-making 
process.

[What is recommended in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia?].

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a malignant transformation and 
proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells that cause a replacement of normal 
hematopoiesis. Diagnostic workup for AML includes cytogenetic analysis and 
mutational screening covering frequently mutated genes in AML. The genetic 
analysis is required for risk stratification and treatment decisions. Very 
recently, three novel drugs have been approved for patients who can be 
intensively treated: a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (midostaurin) for patients with 
FLT3 mutations, a liposomal formulation of chemotherapy (CPX) for patients with 
features of secondary AML, and a CD33 antibody-drug conjugate 
(gemtuzumab-ozogamicin) for AML with CD33 expression. Allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation remains an important treatment strategy for patients with 
intermediate- or high-risk AML and for patients with relapsed AML. For elderly 
patients who cannot undergo intensive treatment, demethylating agents are the 
treatment of choice. The aim is to prolong life expectancy with acceptable 
quality of life. In recent clinical trials, novel drugs have shown promising 
results in this patient population. Some of these drugs have already been 
approved in the US. Among these drugs are the Bcl‑2 inhibitor venetoclax, which 
is already approved in Germany for chronic lymphatic leukemia, as well as 
IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors (the latter for patients with IDH1/IDH2 mutated AML). Acute 
promyelocytic leukemia represents a special type of AML that should be treated 
with a combination of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide leading to 
excellent outcome.

OBJECTIVES: To calculate lifetime risks of cancer diagnosis and cancer-specific 
death, adjusted for competing mortality, and to compare these estimates with the 
corresponding risks published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 
(AIHW).
DESIGN, SETTING: Analysis of publicly available annual AIHW data on age-specific 
cancer incidence and mortality - for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate 
cancer, melanoma of the skin, and lung cancer - and all-cause mortality in 
Australia, 1982-2013.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime risks of cancer diagnosis and mortality (to age 85), 
adjusted for competing mortality.
RESULTS: During 1982-2013, AIHW estimates were consistently higher than our 
competing mortality-adjusted estimates of lifetime risks of diagnosis and death 
for all five cancers. Differences between AIHW and adjusted estimates declined 
with time for breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer 
(for men only), but remained steady for lung cancer (women only) and melanoma of 
the skin. In 2013, the respective estimated lifetime risks of diagnosis (AIHW 
and adjusted) were 12.7% and 12.1% for breast cancer, 18.7% and 16.2% for 
prostate cancer, 9.0% and 7.0% (men) and 6.4% and 5.5% (women) for colorectal 
cancer, 7.5% and 6.0% (men) and 4.4% and 4.0% (women) for melanoma of the skin, 
and 7.6% and 5.8% (men) and 4.5% and 3.9% (women) for lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: The method employed in Australia to calculate the lifetime risks of 
cancer diagnosis and mortality overestimates these risks, especially for men.

BACKGROUND: Chronological skin aging causes the modification of genetic material 
through enzymes and proteins changes. The process reduces cellular 
proliferation, along with loss of tissue elasticity, reduced ability to regulate 
aqueous exchanges, and inefficient tissue replication. Appearance is negatively 
affected by cumulative changes in coloration, texture, and elasticity over time. 
The increase in the population's average life expectancy boosts the search for 
cosmetic therapies that can delay aging, mostly for the noninvasive modalities. 
Among the various options, radiofrequency therapy is a technique that can help 
reduce the effects of skin aging.
AIM: Therefore, this study aims to review clinical evidence provided by 
scientific literature on the benefits of using radiofrequency therapy in 
reducing skin aging effects.
METHODS: A review of the literature concerning skin aging, characteristics of 
radiofrequency therapy, and radiofrequency therapy in the treatment of skin 
laxity and mechanism of action was conducted using PubMed.
RESULTS: The included studies have suggested that the mechanism of 
radiofrequency action is heating the dermis while preserving the epidermis. This 
heating causes immediate collagen denaturation, which is followed by the 
formation of new collagen, naturally providing skin tightening and greater 
elasticity.
CONCLUSION: Even when used as single therapeutic modality, radiofrequency seems 
to meet the expectations in reducing the effects of skin aging.

Early Biological Aging and Fetal Exposure to High and Low Ambient Temperature: A 
Birth Cohort Study.

Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Although studies have provided estimates of premature mortality to 
either heat or cold in adult populations, and fetal exposure to ambient 
temperature may be associated with life expectancy, the effects of temperature 
on aging in early life have not yet been studied. Telomere length (TL) is a 
marker of biological aging, and a short TL at birth may predict lifespan and 
disease susceptibility later in life.
OBJECTIVES: We studied to what extent prenatal ambient temperature exposure is 
associated with newborn TL.
METHODS: In the ENVIRONAGE (ENVIRonmental influence ON early AGEing) birth 
cohort in Flanders, Belgium, we measured cord blood and placental TL in 1,103 
mother-newborn pairs (singletons with  ≥ 36 wk of gestation) using a 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. We associated 
newborn TL with average weekly exposure to ambient temperature using distributed 
lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) while controlling for potential confounders. 
Double-threshold DLNMs were used to estimate cold and heat thresholds and the 
linear associations between temperature and TL below the cold threshold and 
above the heat threshold.
RESULTS: Prenatal temperature exposure above the heat threshold (19.5°C) was 
associated with shorter cord blood TL. The association with a 1°C increase in 
temperature was strongest at week 36 of gestation and resulted in a 3.29% [95% 
confidence interval (CI): - 4.67, - 1.88] shorter cord blood TL. Consistently, 
prenatal temperature exposure below the cold threshold (5.0°C) was associated 
with longer cord blood TL. The association with a 1°C decrease in temperature 
was strongest at week 10 of gestation with 0.72% (95% CI: 0.46, 0.97) longer 
cord blood TL.
DISCUSSION: Our study supports potential effects of prenatal temperature 
exposure on longevity and disease susceptibility later in life. Future climate 
scenarios might jeopardize the potential molecular longevity of future 
generations from birth onward. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5153.

The IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (www.guidetopharmacology.org) is an 
open-access, expert-curated database of molecular interactions between ligands 
and their targets. We describe significant updates made over the seven releases 
during the last two years. The database is notably enhanced through the 
continued linking of relevant pharmacology with key immunological data types as 
part of the IUPHAR Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY 
(www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org) and by a major new extension, the IUPHAR/MMV 
Guide to Malaria PHARMACOLOGY (www.guidetomalariapharmacology.org). The latter 
has been constructed in partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, an 
organization dedicated to identifying, developing and delivering new 
antimalarial therapies that are both effective and affordable. This is in 
response to the global challenge of over 200 million cases of malaria and 400 
000 deaths worldwide, with the majority in the WHO Africa Region. It provides 
new pharmacological content, including molecular targets in the malaria
