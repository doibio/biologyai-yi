BACKGROUND: Lixisenatide is a potent, selective and short-acting once daily 
prandial glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist which lowers glycohemoglobin 
and body weight by clinically significant amounts in patients with type 2 
diabetes treated with basal insulin, with limited risk of hypoglycemia.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of lixisenatide versus bolus 
insulin, both in combination with basal insulin, in patients with type 2 
diabetes in Norway.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model, a non-product-specific and validated 
simulation model, was used to make clinical and cost projections. Transition 
probabilities, risk adjustments and the progression of complication risk factors 
were derived from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, supplemented with Norwegian 
data. Patients were assumed to receive combination treatment with basal insulin, 
lixisenatide or bolus insulin therapy for 3 years, followed by intensification 
of a basal-bolus insulin regimen for their remaining lifetime. Simulated 
healthcare costs, taken from the public payer perspective, were derived from 
microcosting and diagnosis related groups, discounted at 4% per annum and 
reported in Norwegian krone (NOK). Productivity costs were also captured based 
on extractions from the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration. Health state 
utilities were derived from a systematic literature review. Sensitivity and 
scenario analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Lixisenatide in combination with basal insulin was associated with 
increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and reduced lifetime healthcare 
costs compared to bolus insulin in combination with basal insulin in patients 
with Type 2 diabetes, and can be considered dominant. The net monetary benefit 
of lixisenatide versus bolus insulin was NOK 39,369 per patient. Results were 
sensitive to discounting, the application of excess body weight associated 
disutility and uncertainty surrounding the changes in HbA1c.
CONCLUSIONS: Lixisenatide may be considered an economically efficient therapy in 
combination with basal insulin in the Norwegian setting, due to cost savings, 
weight loss and associated gains in health-related quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Improvements in life expectancy have fuelled debates about the 
statutory retirement age in many European countries. This article contributes to 
this debate by investigating how changes in disability may influence both 
employment outcomes and disability-free life expectancy.
METHODS: We used data from the European Community Household Panel to estimate 
the impact of disability incidence on labour supply by country using propensity 
score techniques. In a second step, we translated the estimated effects of 
disability incidence into effects on working life expectancy as well as 
disability-free life expectancy using multi-state life tables.
RESULTS: Results from the matching analysis show that individuals who become 
disabled are more likely to leave the labour market. However, the size of the 
effect is much weaker than a simple descriptive analysis suggests and varies by 
country. A 10% decrease in disability incidence results in increases in 
disability-free life expectancy and working life expectancy of respectively 0.6 
and 0.07 years on average.
CONCLUSION: A large part of the differences in employment between disabled and 
non-disabled individuals is not due to a causal effect of disability on 
employment. Policies that reduce disability incidence increase disability-free 
life expectancy but have only a limited impact on working life expectancy.

Incorporating Peplau's Theory of Interpersonal Relations to Promote Holistic 
Communication Between Older Adults and Nursing Students.

Deane WH(1), Fain JA(2).

Author information:

With the increased life expectancy, older adults will interact with multiple 
health care providers to manage acute and chronic conditions. These interactions 
include nursing students who use various health care settings to meet the 
clinical practicum requirements of their programs. Nursing faculty are charged 
with facilitating students' learning throughout the program from basic human 
needs, to holistic communication, to advanced medical surgical concepts. Despite 
educating students on holistic communication, there remains a lack of a reliable 
framework to undertake the task of teaching holistic communication skills. 
Nursing students preparing to function as licensed practitioners need to develop 
appropriate knowledge to holistically care for older adults. The purpose of this 
article is to examine Hildegard Peplau's interpersonal relations theory as a 
framework to assist nursing students to understand holistic communication skills 
during their encounters with older adults. Peplau's theory provides nursing a 
useful set of three interlocking and oftentimes overlapping working phases for 
nurses' interaction with patients in the form of the nurse-patient relationship. 
Nursing education could adopt the three phases of Peplau's interpersonal 
relations theory to educate students on holistically communicating with older 
adults.

dermatolog.pl@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: Skin self-examination (SSE) may facilitate early diagnosis of 
melanoma at a potentially curable stage. Little data are available concerning 
the SSE frequency and knowledge about the symptoms of melanoma in non-patient 
populations. The aim of our study was to assess the performance of skin 
self-examination, recognition of potential melanoma symptoms as well as behavior 
related to sun exposure among web users in Poland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among readers of a 
scientific portal. Invited respondents were asked to complete an online 
questionnaire. Finally, statistical analysis was conducted on 4,919 surveys 
towards potential clinical signs of melanoma and SSE performance.
RESULTS: Approximately 60% of respondents had ever performed SSE in their life. 
Only 18.4% declared performance on a regular, monthly, basis. Factors promoting 
this activity were established to be bigger place of residence, higher education 
and sensitive skin phototype, higher level of knowledge concerning melanoma, 
safe tanning rules and, especially, past surgical excision of naevi. Declared 
longer use of tanning beds was linked to understanding better the importance of 
clinical features of melanoma. Awareness of hazardous behavior during sunbathing 
is associated with the attempts to change them.
CONCLUSIONS: Regular SSE is not a common practice, whilst the knowledge about 
the clinical features of melanoma is varied. Therefore, constant pressure should 
be put on promotion of regular skin self-examination and teaching its proper 
techniques, including familiarity with the ABCD (asymmetry; border; color; 
diameter) rule and its extension of "EFG" (elevated, firm, progressive growth) 
criteria.

Quality of Care and Service Expansion for HIV Care and Treatment.

Moore CB(1), Ciaraldi E.

The last two decades have seen exceptional development of antiretroviral 
treatment programs throughout the world. Over 14 million persons are accessing 
antiretroviral treatment (ART) treatment as of early 2015, and life expectancy 
has risen markedly in the most-affected populations. However, large patient 
numbers threaten to overwhelm already over-burdened health care systems and 
retention in care remains suboptimal. Developing innovative strategies to 
alleviate these burdens and retain patients in care remains a challenge. 
Furthermore, despite this expansion, large populations of HIV-infected persons 
remain undiagnosed and are unwilling or unable to access care and treatment 
programs. Marginalized and high-risk populations are particularly in danger of 
remaining outside of care and are also disproportionately affected by HIV. To 
reverse the trend and "fast track" our way out of the epidemic, ambitious 
treatment targets are required, and a concerted effort has to be made to engage 
these populations into care, initiate ART, and attain viral suppression.

Analytical methods appropriate for health economic assessments of transfusion 
safety interventions have not previously been described in ways that facilitate 
their use. Within the context of risk-based decision-making (RBDM), health 
economics can be important for optimizing decisions among competing 
interventions. The objective of this review is to address key considerations and 
limitations of current methods as they apply to blood safety. Because a 
voluntary blood supply is an example of a public good, analyses should be 
conducted from the societal perspective when possible. Two primary study designs 
are recommended for most blood safety intervention assessments: budget impact 
analysis (BIA), which measures the cost to implement an intervention both to the 
blood operator but also in a broader context, and cost-utility analysis (CUA), 
which measures the ratio between costs and health gain achieved, in terms of 
reduced morbidity and mortality, by use of an intervention. These analyses often 
have important limitations because data that reflect specific aspects, for 
example, blood recipient population characteristics or complication rates, are 
not available. Sensitivity analyses play an important role. The impact of 
various uncertain factors can be studied conjointly in probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses. The use of BIA and CUA together provides a comprehensive assessment of 
the costs and benefits from implementing (or not) specific interventions. RBDM 
is multifaceted and impacts a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Gathering and 
analyzing health economic evidence as part of the RBDM process enhances the 
quality, completeness, and transparency of decision-making.

226. Financing Population Health Improvement: Workshop Summary.

Roundtable on Population Health Improvement; Board on Population Health and 
Public Health Practice; Institute of Medicine.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2015 Jan 6.

Despite spending far more on medical care than any other nation and despite 
having seen a century of unparalleled improvement in population health and 
longevity, the United States has fallen behind many of its global counterparts 
and competitors in such health outcomes as overall life expectancy and rates of 
preventable diseases and injuries. A fundamental but often overlooked driver of 
the imbalance between spending and outcomes is the nation's inadequate 
investment in non-clinical strategies that promote health and prevent disease 
and injury population-wide, strategies that fall under the rubric of "population 
health." Given that it is unlikely that government funding for governmental 
public health agencies, whether at the local, state, or federal levels, will see 
significant and sustained increases, there is interest in finding creative 
sources of funding for initiatives to improve population health, both through 
the work of public health agencies and through the contributions of other 
sectors, including nonhealth entities. Financing Population Health Improvement 
is the summary of a workshop convened by the Institute of Medicine Roundtable on 
Population Health Improvement in February 2014 to explore the range of resources 
that might be available to provide a secure funding stream for non-clinical 
actions to enhance health. Presenters and participants discussed the range of 
potential resources (e.g., financial, human, and community) explored topics 
related to financial resources. This report discusses return on investment, the 
value of investing in population-based interventions, and possible sources of 
funding to improve population health.

School of Population Health, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

BACKGROUND: A number of studies have been conducted to estimate willingness to 
pay (WTP) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in patients or general 
population for various diseases. However, there has not been any systematic 
review summarizing the relationship between WTP per QALY and cost-effectiveness 
(CE) threshold based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review willingness-to-pay per 
quality-adjusted-life-year (WTP per QALY) literature, to compare WTP per QALY 
with Cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold recommended by WHO, and to determine 
potential influencing factors.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psyinfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Center of Research Dissemination (CRD), and 
EconLit from inception through 15 July 2014. To be included, studies have to 
estimate WTP per QALY in health-related issues using stated preference method. 
Two investigators independently reviewed each abstract, completed full-text 
reviews, and extracted information for included studies. We compared WTP per 
QALY to GDP per capita, analyzed, and summarized potential influencing factors.
RESULTS: Out of 3,914 articles founded, 14 studies were included. Most studies 
(92.85%) used contingent valuation method, while only one study used discrete 
choice experiments. Sample size varied from 104 to 21,896 persons. The ratio 
between WTP per QALY and GDP per capita varied widely from 0.05 to 5.40, 
depending on scenario outcomes (e.g., whether it extended/saved life or improved 
quality of life), severity of hypothetical scenarios, duration of scenario, and 
source of funding. The average ratio of WTP per QALY and GDP per capita for 
extending life or saving life (2.03) was significantly higher than the average 
for improving quality of life (0.59) with the mean difference of 1.43 (95% CI, 
1.81 to 1.06).
CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides an overview summary of all studies 
estimating WTP per QALY studies. The variation of ratio of WTP per QALY and GDP 
per capita depended on several factors may prompt discussions on the CE 
threshold policy. Our research work provides a foundation for defining future 
direction of decision criteria for an evidence-informed decision making system.

Wheelchair ergonomic hand drive mechanism use improves wrist mechanics 
associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.

Zukowski LA, Roper JA, Shechtman O, Otzel DM, Hovis PW, Tillman MD.

Among conventional manual wheelchair (CMW) users, 49% to 63% experience carpal 
tunnel syndrome (CTS) that is likely induced by large forces transmitted through 
the wrist and extreme wrist orientations. The ergonomic hand drive mechanism 
(EHDM) tested in this study has been shown to utilize a more neutral wrist 
orientation. This study evaluates the use of an EHDM in terms of wrist 
orientations that may predispose individuals to CTS. Eleven adult full-time CMW 
users with spinal cord injury participated. Motion data were captured as 
participants propelled across a flat surface, completing five trials in a CMW 
and five trials in the same CMW fitted with the EHDM. Average angular wrist 
orientations were compared between the two propulsion styles. Use of the EHDM 
resulted in reduced wrist extension and ulnar deviation. The shift to more 
neutral wrist orientations observed with EHDM use may reduce median nerve 
compression.

[Study on biological characteristics of cypermethrin-resistant and -susceptible 
strains of Aedes albopictus at different temperatures].

[Article in Chinese]

Huang XD, Cheng P, Zhao JX, Dai YH, Liu HM, Gong MQ, Kou JX.

OBJECTIVE: To study the biological characteristics of cypermethrin-resistance 
strain and -susceptible strain of Aedes albopictus under different controlled 
temperatures in the laboratory.
METHODS: The two strains were raised at three different temperatures, 20, 25 
degrees C and 28 degrees C respectively, and the biological characteristics of 
the two mosquito strains, such as reproduction, development and life expectancy, 
were observed and recorded in the laboratory.
RESULTS: The life expectancy of both strains became shorter as the temperature 
raised, and the resistant strain(69.37% ± 0.01%, 77.04% ± 0.07%) lived shorter 
than the susceptible strain(85.24% ± 0.03%, 88.23% ± 0.05%)in average. Under 25 
degrees C, the hatching rate of resistant strain decreased by 25.88%, and the 
pupation rate decreased by 11.18%. In the three temperatures, all the life 
expectancy expanded as the temperature went up, the periods for the susceptible 
strain were 19.75 ± 0.10, 23.65 ± 0.07 d and 25.08 ± 0.08 d under 28, 25 degrees 
C and 20 degrees C. While life expectancy for the resistant strain decreased to 
17.21 ± 0.09, 20.95 ± 0.09, 22.58 ± 0.10 d. Under the same temperature, the 
development timing of the resistance strain was longer than that of the 
susceptible strain, and the period was the longest under 28 degrees C (156.2 h, 
137.1 h). In the three temperatures, all the development periods expanded as the 
temperature went up, the susceptible and resistant larvae developed 137.1 d and 
163.3 d, 247.7 d and 156.2 d, 182.3 d and 263.2 d under 28, 25 degrees C and 20 
degrees C. The differences show statistic significance (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The resistance of A. albopictus to cypermethrin results in the 
decrease of adaptability to the environment change and the disadvantage of 
reproduction at different temperatures.

The use of virtual world-based cardiac rehabilitation to encourage healthy 
lifestyle choices among cardiac patients: intervention development and pilot 
study protocol.

United States.

BACKGROUND: Despite proven benefits through the secondary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and reduction of mortality, cardiac rehabilitation 
(CR) remains underutilized in cardiac patients. Underserved populations most 
affected by CVD including rural residents, low socioeconomic status patients, 
and racial/ethnic minorities have the lowest participation rates due to access 
barriers. Internet-and mobile-based lifestyle interventions have emerged as 
potential modalities to complement and increase accessibility to CR. An 
outpatient CR program using virtual world technology may provide an effective 
alternative to conventional CR by overcoming patient access limitations such as 
geographics, work schedule constraints, and transportation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the research protocol of a 
two-phased, pilot study that will assess the feasibility (Phase 1) and 
comparative effectiveness (Phase 2) of a virtual world-based (Second Life) CR 
program as an extension of a conventional CR program in achieving healthy 
behavioral change among post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and post-percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) patients. We hypothesize that virtual world CR users 
will improve behaviors (physical activity, diet, and smoking) to a greater 
degree than conventional CR participants.
METHODS: In Phase 1, we will recruit at least 10 patients enrolled in outpatient 
CR who were recently hospitalized for an ACS (unstable angina, ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) 
or who recently underwent elective PCI at Mayo Clinic Hospital, Rochester Campus 
in Rochester, MN with at least one modifiable, lifestyle risk factor target 
(sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, and current smoking). Recruited patients 
will participate in a 12-week, virtual world health education program which will 
provide feedback on the feasibility, usability, and design of the intervention. 
During Phase 2, we will conduct a 2-arm, parallel group, single-center, 
randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to 
adjunct virtual world-based CR with conventional CR or conventional CR only. The 
primary outcome is a composite including at least one of the following (1) at 
least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, (2) daily consumption of five 
or more fruits and vegetables, and (3) smoking cessation. Patients will be 
assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months.
RESULTS: The Phase 1 feasibility study is currently open for recruitment which 
will be followed by the Phase 2 RCT. The anticipated completion date for the 
study is May 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: While research on the use of virtual world technology in health 
programs is in its infancy, it offers unique advantages over current Web-based 
health interventions including social interactivity and active learning. It also 
increases accessibility to vulnerable populations who have higher burdens of 
CVD. This study will yield results on the effectiveness of a virtual world-based 
CR program as an innovative platform to influence healthy lifestyle behavior and 
self-efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a condition characterised by the 
presence of visual hallucinations, mainly complex, in patients with significant 
vision loss and without cognitive impairment. The rise in CBS cases is due to an 
increased life expectancy and to the development of age-related pathologies such 
as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We herein analyse the main characteristics present in 45 
patients diagnosed with CBS at the Neuro-ophthalmology Unit in Hospital Clinico 
San Carlos. The patients were referred from the macular pathology, glaucoma and 
ocular surface units, as well as from AE, where they were diagnosed with CBS and 
later confirmed at the Multidisciplinary Unit formed by the ophthalmology, 
neurology and psychiatry services of the hospital.
RESULTS: Women (66.66%) over 80 constituted 68.88% of the patients and mainly 
had AMD (37.77%). The most prevalent hallucinations described by the patients 
were of people and faces (35.55%), in colour (66.66%), in movement (80%), had 
developed over a period of 6 to 12 months (26.66%), had a frequency of 3 
episodes per day (35.55%) and lasted between 3 to 5 minutes (35.55%).
CONCLUSIONS: CBS is a complex disorder that requires a multidisciplinary 
approach from neurologists, psychiatrists, general practitioners and 
ophthalmologists. New studies are needed in order to understand its clinical 
presentation and behaviour, and thus improve its management.

hospital. Resultados. El 66,66% eran mujeres, de mas de 80 anos (68,88%), 
principalmente con degeneracion macular asociada a la edad (37,77%). Las 
alucinaciones que los pacientes presentaban con mas frecuencia eran personas y 
caras (35,55%), en color (66,66%), en movimiento (80%), con un tiempo de 
evolucion de 6-12 meses (26,66%), frecuencia de tres episodios al dia (35,55%) y 
de 3-5 minutos de duracion (35,55%). Conclusiones. El SCB es un complejo 
sindrome cuya incidencia se esta incrementando en nuestras consultas y que 
precisa un abordaje multidisciplinar entre oftalmologos, neurologos y 
psiquiatras para evitar diagnosticos erroneos y proporcionar un tratamiento 
adecuado. Son necesarios nuevos estudios para un conocimiento mas profundo y 
adecuado del SCB.

The impact of a healthy lifestyle on Disability-Adjusted Life Years: a 
prospective cohort study.

May AM, Struijk EA, Fransen HP, Onland-Moret NC, de Wit GA, Boer JM, van der 
Schouw YT, Hoekstra J, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Peeters PH, Beulens JW.

BACKGROUND: The association between single health behaviours and incidence of 
and premature mortality from major chronic diseases, including myocardial 
infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and cancer, has been demonstrated 
thoroughly. However, the association of several healthy behaviours with 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), which is a measure for total health 
combining Years Lost due to Disability and the Years of Life Lost due to 
premature mortality, has not been studied yet.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 33,066 healthy men and 
women aged 20 to 70 years recruited into the EPIC-NL study during 1993 to 1997. 
Participants' smoking status, BMI, physical activity, and adherence to a 
Mediterranean-style diet (excluding alcohol) were investigated separately and 
combined into a simple health behaviour score ranging from 0 to 4. Participants 
were followed until the end of 2007 for occurrence of and mortality from the 
most important chronic diseases. The association between lifestyle (separate 
lifestyle factors and a simple health behaviour score) and DALYs were adjusted 
for relevant confounders.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 12.4 years, 6,647 disease incidences and 
1,482 deaths were documented. Non-smoking, low BMI (BMI <25), being physically 
active, and adherence to a Mediterranean diet were all associated with a 
significantly lower disease burden. Persons adhering to all four healthy 
lifestyle characteristics lived a minimum of 2 years longer in good health 
(DALYs: -2.13; 95% CI: -2.65 to -1.62) than persons with none. Due to our 
non-extinct cohort, the total number of DALYs, and consequently the estimates, 
is underestimated. Therefore, true lifetime health benefits of a healthy 
lifestyle will be even larger.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-smoking, a low BMI, being physically active, and adherence to a 
Mediterranean diet were associated with a lower disease burden. Each additional 
healthy lifestyle factor contributed to a longer life in good health.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a critical social and health issue, adversely impacting 
life expectancy, quality of life, and mental health. Minorities are 
disproportionately impacted by obesity with African Americans experiencing the 
highest prevalence among minority groups.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if a lifestyle program that 
integrated chair exercises, nutrition and educational counseling, and scripture 
readings would help under-served obese African American women make lifestyle 
changes that would positively impact their quality of life, especially mental 
health.
METHODS: A repeated measures intervention study was conducted (24-weeks). Weeks 
1-12 involved meeting twice a week for a total of 4h with participants engaged 
in chair exercises, educational counseling, and scripture readings. During weeks 
13-24, the participants were "on their own" but were encouraged to exercise and 
eat healthy. Focus groups were held at 12 and 24-weeks. Participants were 
recruited from a nurse managed center and a primary care clinic for the 
uninsured. Mental health data were collected at baseline, 12, and 24-weeks. The 
Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Version 2 (SF-36v2) was used to measure 
changes in mental health. Higher scores indicate better perceived health status. 
Group scores less than 47 indicate impaired functioning.
FINDINGS: 55 women had complete data for all three data collection points, with 
a mean age of 50 and a mean BMI of 41.2. Repeated ANOVAs detected significant 
differences on the mental component summary of the SF-36v2: this score improved 
from baseline (M=44.1) to 12-weeks (M=50.7) but decreased at 24-weeks (M=47.9) 
(p=.000). The four domains (vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental 
health) were also significantly different over the three data collection points.
IMPLICATIONS: The findings have significant implications for psychiatric nurses 
in terms of education, clinical practice, and future research. The study 
contributed to the participants' mental health through the various group 
activities including scripture readings, socialization with "like minded" women 
and structured exercises. These findings offer psychiatric nurses additional 
tools for effective care.

BACKGROUND: Foam sclerotherapy (foam) and endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) have 
emerged as alternative treatments to surgery for patients with varicose veins, 
but uncertainty exists regarding their effectiveness in the medium to longer 
term.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of foam, 
EVLA and surgery for the treatment of varicose veins.
DESIGN: A parallel-group randomised controlled trial (RCT) without blinding, and 
economic modelling evaluation.
SETTING: Eleven UK specialist vascular centres.
PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred and ninety-eight patients with primary varicose 
veins (foam, n = 292; surgery, n = 294; EVLA, n = 212).
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised between all three treatment options 
(eight centres) or between foam and surgery (three centres).
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-specific [Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire 
(AVVQ)] and generic [European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Form 
questionnaire-36 items (SF-36) physical and mental component scores] quality of 
life (QoL) at 6 months. Cost-effectiveness as cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained.
SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life at 6 weeks; residual varicose veins; 
Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS); complication rates; return to normal 
activity; truncal vein ablation rates; and costs.
RESULTS: The results appear generalisable in that participants' baseline 
characteristics (apart from a lower-than-expected proportion of females) and 
post-treatment improvement in outcomes were comparable with those in other RCTs. 
The health gain achieved in the AVVQ with foam was significantly lower than with 
surgery at 6 months [effect size -1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.97 to 
-0.50; p = 0.006], but was similar to that achieved with EVLA. The health gain 
in SF-36 mental component score for foam was worse than that for EVLA (effect 
size 1.54, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.06; p = 0.048) but similar to that for surgery. 
There were no differences in EQ-5D or SF-36 component scores in the surgery 
versus foam or surgery versus EVLA comparisons at 6 months. The trial-based 
cost-effectiveness analysis showed that, at 6 months, foam had the highest 
probability of being considered cost-effective at a ceiling willingness-to-pay 
ratio of £20,000 per QALY. EVLA was found to cost £26,107 per QALY gained versus 
foam, and was less costly and generated slightly more QALYs than surgery. Markov 
modelling using trial costs and the limited recurrence data available suggested 
that, at 5 years, EVLA had the highest probability (≈ 79%) of being 
cost-effective at conventional thresholds, followed by foam (≈ 17%) and surgery 
(≈ 5%). With regard to secondary outcomes, health gains at 6 weeks (p < 0.005) 
were greater for EVLA than for foam (EQ-5D, p = 0.004). There were fewer 
procedural complications in the EVLA group (1%) than after foam (7%) and surgery 
(8%) (p < 0.001). Participants returned to a wide range of behaviours more 
quickly following foam or EVLA than following surgery (p < 0.05). There were no 
differences in VCSS between the three treatments. Truncal ablation rates were 
higher for surgery (p < 0.001) and EVLA (p < 0.001) than for foam, and were 
similar for surgery and EVLA.
CONCLUSIONS: Considerations of both the 6-month clinical outcomes and the 
estimated 5-year cost-effectiveness suggest that EVLA should be considered as 
the treatment of choice for suitable patients.
FUTURE WORK: Five-year trial results are currently being evaluated to compare 
the cost-effectiveness of foam, surgery and EVLA, and to determine the 
recurrence rates following each treatment. This trial has highlighted the need 
for long-term outcome data from RCTs on QoL, recurrence rates and costs for foam 
sclerotherapy and other endovenous techniques compared against each other and 
against surgery.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common form of inherited retinal 
degeneration, is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and can appear as 
syndromic or non-syndromic. Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS IIIC) is a 
lethal disorder, caused by mutations in the heparan-alpha-glucosaminide 
N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT) gene and characterized by progressive neurological 
deterioration, with retinal degeneration as a prominent feature. We identified 
HGSNAT mutations in six patients with non-syndromic RP. Whole exome sequencing 
(WES) in an Ashkenazi Jewish Israeli RP patient revealed a novel homozygous 
HGSNAT variant, c.370A>T, which leads to partial skipping of exon 3. Screening 
of 66 Ashkenazi RP index cases revealed an additional family with two siblings 
homozygous for c.370A>T. WES in three Dutch siblings with RP revealed a complex 
HGSNAT variant, c.[398G>C; 1843G>A] on one allele, and c.1843G>A on the other 
allele. HGSNAT activity levels in blood leukocytes of patients were reduced 
compared with healthy controls, but usually higher than those in MPS IIIC 
patients. All patients were diagnosed with non-syndromic RP and did not exhibit 
neurological deterioration, or any phenotypic features consistent with MPS IIIC. 
Furthermore, four of the patients were over 60 years old, exceeding by far the 
life expectancy of MPS IIIC patients. HGSNAT is highly expressed in the mouse 
retina, and we hypothesize that the retina requires higher HGSNAT activity to 
maintain proper function, compared with other tissues associated with MPS IIIC, 
such as the brain. This report broadens the spectrum of phenotypes associated 
with HGSNAT mutations and highlights the critical function of HGSNAT in the 
human retina.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the three causes of death that has had 
the highest increase in the last 20 years. The increasing CKD burden occurs in 
the context of lack of access of most of the world population to adequate 
healthcare and an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of CKD. However, 
CKD is not homogeneously distributed. CKD hotspots are defined as countries, 
region, communities or ethnicities with higher than average incidence of CKD. 
Analysis of CKD hotspots has the potential to provide valuable insights into the 
pathogenesis of kidney disease and to improve the life expectancy of the 
affected communities. Examples include ethnicities such as African Americans in 
the USA or Aboriginals in Australia, regions such as certain Balkan valleys or 
Central America and even groups of people sharing common activities or interests 
such as young women trying to lose weight in Belgium. The study of these CKD 
hotspots has identified underlying genetic factors, such as ApoL1 gene variants, 
environmental toxins, such as aristolochic acid and socioeconomic factors 
leading to nutritional deprivation and inflammation/infection. The CKD hotspots 
series of CKJ reviews will explore the epidemiology and causes in CKD hotspots, 
beginning with Australian Aboriginals in this issue. An online map of CKD 
hotspots around the world will feature the reviewed hotspots, highlighting known 
or suspected causes as well as ongoing projects to unravel the cause and 
providing a directory of public health officials, physicians and basic 
scientists involved in these efforts. Since the high prevalence of CKD in a 
particular region or population may only be known to local physicians, we 
encourage readers to propose further CKD hotspots to be reviewed.

In this study we provide the first comprehensive map of DNA conformational 
flexibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae complete genome. Flexibility plays a key 
role in DNA supercoiling and DNA/protein binding, regulating DNA transcription, 
replication or repair. Specific interest in flexibility analysis concerns its 
relationship with human genome instability. Enrichment in flexible sequences has 
been detected in unstable regions of human genome defined fragile sites, where 
genes map and carry frequent deletions and rearrangements in cancer. Flexible 
sequences have been suggested to be the determinants of fragile gene proneness 
to breakage; however, their actual role and properties remain elusive. Our in 
silico analysis carried out genome-wide via the StabFlex algorithm, shows the 
conserved presence of highly flexible regions in budding yeast genome as well as 
in genomes of other Saccharomyces sensu stricto species. Flexibile peaks in S. 
cerevisiae identify 175 ORFs mapping on their 3'UTR, a region affecting mRNA 
translation, localization and stability. (TA)n repeats of different extension 
shape the central structure of peaks and co-localize with polyadenylation 
efficiency element (EE) signals. ORFs with flexible peaks share common features. 
Transcripts are characterized by decreased half-life: this is considered 
peculiar of genes involved in regulatory systems with high turnover; 
consistently, their function affects biological processes such as cell cycle 
regulation or stress response. Our findings support the functional importance of 
flexibility peaks, suggesting that the flexible sequence may be derived by an 
expansion of canonical TAYRTA polyadenylation efficiency element. The flexible 
(TA)n repeat amplification could be the outcome of an evolutionary 
neofunctionalization leading to a differential 3'-end processing and expression 
regulation in genes with peculiar function. Our study provides a new support to 
the functional role of flexibility in genomes and a strategy for its 
characterization inside human fragile sites.

Myelofibrosis (MF), including primary, post-essential thrombocythemia and 
post-polycythemia vera MF, associates with a reduced quality of life and 
shortened life expectancy. Dysregulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is prominent, even in 
the absence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Therefore, all symptomatic MF patients 
may potentially derive benefit from JAK inhibitors. Despite the efficacy of JAK 
inhibitors in controlling signs and symptoms of MF, they do not eradicate the 
disease. Therefore, JAK inhibitors are currently being tested in combination 
with other novel therapies, a strategy which may be more effective in reducing 
disease burden, either by overcoming JAK inhibitor resistance or targeting 
additional mechanisms of pathogenesis. Additional targets include modulators of 
epigenetic regulation, pathways that work downstream from JAK/STAT (i.e. 
mammalian target of rapamycin/AKT/phosphoinositide 3-kinase) heat shock protein 
90, hedgehog signaling, pro-fibrotic factors, abnormal megakaryocytes and 
telomerase. In this review, we discuss novel MF therapeutic strategies.

Breast cancer screening for women with Down syndrome: lessons learned.

Chicoine B, Roth M, Chicoine L, Sulo S.

This study examined mammogram reports of women with Down syndrome (DS) treated 
in the largest medical facility specifically serving adults with DS in the 
United States. Records of 684 women and results of 993 mammograms were reviewed, 
including 902 screening and 93 diagnostic mammograms. Only 2 (0.7%) women had a 
diagnosis of breast cancer. This study found a low rate of breast cancer among 
women with DS, a finding which is consistent with previous studies. The 
financial cost per finding was high, the benefit of the mammograms questionable, 
and the potential for harm greater. With less than 1% of the women with DS in 
this study developing breast cancer, further discussion is recommended to assess 
whether mammography is a beneficial, cost-effective part of health maintenance 
for women with DS.

Long-term Cost-effectiveness of Statin Treatment for Primary Prevention of 
Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly.

Healthcare Group, 3 Fusionopolis Link, #03-08 Nexus@one-north, Singapore,

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of statins for 
primary prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in the elderly in 
Singapore.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate the lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) of statin treatment in those aged 65 years and older without a history 
of stroke or MI from the perspective of Singapore's healthcare system, using 
elderly-specific clinical data and local costs from hospital databases. A 
lifetime horizon was used and all costs and health outcomes were discounted at 
3% annually.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, statin treatment prevented an additional 
four strokes and eight MIs among 1,000 "healthy" elderly individuals compared 
with no treatment. Statin treatment resulted in a QALY gain of 0.26 and 
additional costs of SGD 11,314 per person, yielding an ICER of SGD 43,925 (USD 
33,495) per QALY gained. The results were sensitive to statin effectiveness, 
particularly statins' effect on all-cause mortality, and cost of statin 
medication. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability 
of statin treatment being cost-effective was 72% at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of SGD 65,000 (USD 49,546) per QALY gained. Shortening the time 
horizon from lifetime to 10 years (simulating limited life expectancy) 
considerably increased the ICER to SGD 291,313 (USD 167,171) per QALY. Female 
gender and younger age were also associated with higher ICERs owing to a lower 
baseline risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and higher costs to manage events 
in these subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in the elderly 
was cost-effective. However, treatment warrants re-evaluation when the prognosis 
of the individual is considered less than ten years; other goals may take 
precedence over CVD prevention.

In Germany there are 16 million people with a migration background, one in five 
of the total population. There are relatively few migrant mortality studies in
