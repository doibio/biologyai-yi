The objective of this study was to determine the impact of beef production 
systems utilizing additive combinations of growth promotant technologies on 
animal and carcass performance and environmental outcomes. Crossbred steer 
calves (n =120) were stratified by birth date, birth weight, and dam age and 
assigned randomly to one of four treatments: 1) no technology (NT; control), 2) 
antibiotic treated (ANT; NT plus therapeutic antibiotics and monensin and 
tylosin), 3) implant treated (IMP; ANT plus a series of 3 implants, and 4) 
beta-agonist treated (BA; IMP plus ractopamine-HCl for the last 30 d prior to 
harvest). Weaned steers were fed in confinement (dry lot) and finished in an 
individual feeding system to collect performance data. At harvest, standard 
carcass measures were collected and the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) Yield Grade and Quality Grade were determined. Information from the 
cow-calf, growing, and finishing phases were used to simulate production systems 
using the USDA Integrated Farm System Model, which included a partial life cycle 
assessment of cattle production for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fossil 
energy use, water use, and reactive N loss. Body weight in suckling, growing, 
and finishing phases as well as hot carcass weight was greater (P < 0.05) for 
steers that received implants (IMP and BA) than non-implanted steers (NT and 
ANT). The average daily gain was greater (P < 0.05) for steers that received 
implants (IMP and BA) than non-implanted steers during the suckling and 
finishing phases, but no difference (P = 0.232) was detected during the growing 
phase. Dry matter intake and gain:feed were greater (P < 0.05) for steers that 
received implants than non-implanted steers during the finishing phase. Steers 
that received implants responded (P < 0.05) with a larger loin muscle area, less 
kidney pelvic and heart fat, advanced carcass maturity, reduced marbling scores, 
and a greater percentage of carcasses in the lower third of the USDA Choice 
grade. This was offset by a lower percentage of USDA Prime grading carcasses 
compared with steers receiving no implants. Treatments did not influence (P > 
0.05) USDA Yield grade. The life cycle assessment revealed that IMP and BA 
treatments reduced GHG emissions, energy use, water use, and reactive nitrogen 
loss compared to NT and ANT. These data indicate that growth promoting 
technologies increase carcass yield while concomitantly reducing carcass quality 
and environmental impacts.

Romosozumab is a novel bone-building drug that reduces fracture risk. This 
health economic analysis indicates that sequential romosozumab-to-alendronate 
can be a cost-effective treatment option for postmenopausal women with severe 
osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.
PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequential treatment with 
romosozumab followed by alendronate ("romosozumab-to-alendronate") compared with 
alendronate alone in patients with severe osteoporosis at high risk of fracture 
in Sweden.
METHODS: A microsimulation model with a Markov structure was used to simulate 
fractures, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), for women treated 
with romosozumab-to-alendronate or alendronate alone. Patients aged 74 years 
with a recent major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) were followed from the start of 
treatment until the age of 100 years or death. Treatment with romosozumab for 
12 months was followed by alendronate for up to 48 months or alendronate alone 
with a maximum treatment duration of 60 months. The analysis had a societal 
perspective. Efficacy of romosozumab and alendronate were derived from phase III 
randomized controlled trials. Resource use and unit costs were collected from 
the literature. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with QALYs as effectiveness measures.
RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that sequential 
romosozumab-to-alendronate treatment was associated with 0.089 additional QALYs 
at an additional cost of €3002 compared to alendronate alone, resulting in an 
ICER of €33,732. At a Swedish reference willingness-to-pay per QALY of €60,000, 
romosozumab-to-alendronate had a 97.9% probability of being cost-effective 
against alendronate alone. The results were most sensitive to time horizon, 
persistence assumptions, patient age, and treatment efficacy.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that sequential 
romosozumab-to-alendronate can be a cost-effective treatment option for 
postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review evidence regarding the association between bipolar 
disorder and schizophrenia, henceforth referred to as severe mental disorders 
(SMD), and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, its mechanisms, and the 
interventions to reduce this burden.
RECENT FINDINGS: Much of the loss in life expectancy in people with SMD remains 
driven by cardiovascular mortality. Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are 
associated with negative cardio-metabolic outcomes, but large inter-individual 
differences are observed, and not treating SMD might be associated with even 
greater cardiovascular mortality. Classical modifiable cardiovascular risk 
factors remained inadequately screened and, once identified, too seldom treated 
in people with SMD. After a myocardial infarction, aggressive tertiary 
prevention may be as effective in people with SMD as in the general population 
but is less prescribed. Reduced healthcare quality and increased prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors may not fully explain the excess cardiovascular 
mortality associated with SMDs, which themselves should be considered risk 
factors in risk calculators. Hazardous health behaviors, the cardio-metabolic 
adverse effects of medications, and a reduced access to quality healthcare 
remain priority targets for intervention.

BACKGROUND: As Nigeria prepares to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, the Gavi board 
has approved the extension of the transition period for the country until 2028. 
The current position of the country on Gavi's funding profile calls for a 
pragmatic step in planning and implementation so that sustainability at the 
fully self-financing phase will be feasible.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to inform the decisions of the country's health 
policymakers on the costs, benefits, and implications of the introduction of 
rotavirus vaccine.
METHODS: This study was an economic evaluation using a simulation-based Markov 
model. It compared four approaches: 'no vaccination' and vaccination with 
ROTARIX, ROTAVAC, or ROTASIIL. Ten cohorts from the year 2021 to 2030 were used 
in the analysis. Primary measures were the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Future costs and outcomes were 
discounted to 2019 values.
RESULTS: The adjusted vaccine cost of ROTARIX was the highest, followed by 
ROTAVAC and ROTASIIL, whereas the immunization delivery cost was in the reverse 
order. All the vaccines were very cost effective, with ROTARIX being the optimal 
choice for the 10-year period, having a BCR of 27 and an ICER of $US100 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 71-130)/disability-adjusted life-year averted. Adopting 
ROTARIX was the optimal choice from 2021 to 2027, whereas ROTAVAC was optimal 
from 2028 to 2030. The net budget impact of the programme was $US76.9 million 
for the 10-year period. The opportunity cost of a late introduction was about 
$US8 million per annum from 2021 to 2028.
CONCLUSIONS: The rotavirus vaccine ROTARIX should be implemented in Nigeria at 
the earliest opportunity. A switch to ROTAVAC should be considered from the year 
2028. Cost-minimization measures are imperative to ensure the sustainability of 
the programme after the transition out of Gavi support.

A basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hey2 is expressed in the 
ventricular myocardium and endocardium of mouse embryos, and Hey2 null mice die 
perinatally showing ventricular septal defect, dysplastic tricuspid valve and 
hypoplastic right ventricle. In order to understand region-specific roles of 
Hey2 during cardiac morphogenesis, we generated Hey2 conditional knockout (cKO) 
mice using Mef2c-AHF-Cre, which was active in the anterior part of the second 
heart field and the right ventricle and outflow tract of the heart. Hey2 cKO 
neonates reproduced three anomalies commonly observed in Hey2 null mice. An 
earliest morphological defect was the lack of right ventricular extension along 
the apico-basal axis at midgestational stages. Underdevelopment of the right 
ventricle was present in all cKO neonates including those without apparent 
atresia of right-sided atrioventricular connection. RNA sequencing analysis of 
cKO embryos identified that the gene expression of a non-chamber T-box factor 
Tbx2 was ectopically induced in the chamber myocardium of the right ventricle. 
Consistently, mRNA expression of the Mycn transcription factor, which was a cell 
cycle regulator transcriptionally repressed by Tbx2, was down regulated, and the 
number of S-phase cells was significantly decreased in the right ventricle of 
cKO heart. These results suggest that Hey2 plays an important role in right 
ventricle development during cardiac morphogenesis, at least in part, through 
mitigating Tbx2-dependent inhibition of Mycn expression.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether physiotherapist-led exercise intervention and 
US-guided subacromial CS injection is cost-effective when compared with standard 
advice and exercise leaflet and unguided injection in patients with subacromial 
pain (impingement) syndrome.
METHODS: An incremental cost-utility analysis using patient responses to the 
five-level EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire was undertaken from a healthcare 
perspective alongside a 2 × 2 factorial randomized trial with 256 participants 
over a 12-month follow-up period. Uncertainty was explored through the use of 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis indicated that physiotherapist-led exercise 
was associated with an incremental cost of £155.99 (95% CI 69.02, 241.93) and 
0.031 (95% CI -0.01, 0.07) additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £5031 per QALY gained and an 85% 
chance of being cost-effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained 
compared with the advice and exercise leaflet. US-guided injection was 
associated with an incremental cost of £15.89 (95% CI -59.36, 109.86) and 0.024 
(95% CI -0.02, 0.07) additional QALYs, an ICER of £662 per QALY gained and a 83% 
chance of being cost-effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained 
compared with unguided injection.
CONCLUSION: Physiotherapist-led exercise was cost-effective compared with the 
advice and exercise leaflet, and US-guided injection was cost-effective when 
compared with unguided injection.

A novel cost-effectiveness model framework was developed to incorporate the 
elevated fracture risk associated with a recent fracture and to allow sequential 
osteoporosis therapies to be evaluated. Treating patients with severe 
osteoporosis after a recent fracture with a bone-forming agent followed by 
antiresorptive therapy can be cost-effective compared with antiresorptive 
therapy alone. Incorporating these novel technical attributes in economic 
evaluations can support appropriate policy and reimbursement decision-making.
PURPOSE: To develop a cost-effectiveness model accommodating increased fracture 
risk after a recent fracture and treatment sequencing.
METHODS: A micro-simulation cost-utility model was developed to accommodate both 
treatment sequencing and increased risk with recent fracture. The risk of 
fracture was estimated and simulated using the FRAX® algorithms combined with 
Swedish registry data on imminent fracture relative risk. In the base-case 
cost-effectiveness analysis, a sequential treatment starting with a bone-forming 
agent for 12 months followed by an antiresorptive agent for 48 months initiated 
immediately after a major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) in a 70-year-old woman 
with a T-score of 2.5 or less was compared to an antiresorptive treatment alone 
for 60 months. The model was populated with data relevant for a UK population 
reflecting a personal social service perspective.
RESULTS: The cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the 
base-case setting was estimated at £34,584. Sensitivity analyses revealed the 
sequential treatment to be cost-saving compared with administering a 
bone-forming treatment alone. Without simulating an elevated fracture risk 
immediately after a recent fracture, the cost per QALY changed from £34,584 to 
£62,184.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating imminent fracture risk in economic evaluations has a 
significant impact on the cost-effectiveness when evaluating fracture prevention 
treatments in patients with osteoporosis who sustained a recent fracture. 
Bone-forming treatment followed by antiresorptive therapy can be cost-effective 
compared to antiresorptive therapy alone depending on treatment acquisition 
costs.

Vaccination is successfully advanced to control several fatal diseases and 
improve human life expectancy. However, additional innovations are required in 
this field because there are no effective vaccines to prevent some infectious 
diseases. The shift from the attenuated or inactivated pathogens to safer but 
less immunogenic protein or peptide antigens has led to a search for effective 
antigen delivery carriers that can function as both antigen vehicles and 
intrinsic adjuvants. Among these carriers, self-assembled nanoparticles (SANPs) 
have shown great potential to be the best representative. For the nanoscale and 
multiple presentation of antigens, with accurate control over size, geometry, 
and functionality, these nanoparticles are assembled spontaneously and mimic 
pathogens, resulting in enhanced antigen presentation and increased cellular and 
humoral immunity responses. In addition, they may be applied through needle-free 
routes due to their adhesive ability, which gives them a great future in 
vaccination applications. This review provides an overview of various SANPs and 
their applications in prophylactic vaccines.

Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line Versus Second-Line Use of Daratumumab in Older, 
Transplant-Ineligible Patients With Multiple Myeloma.

PURPOSE: The MAIA trial found that addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone (DRd) significantly prolonged progression-free survival in 
transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, compared 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd). However, daratumumab is a costly 
treatment and is administered indefinitely until disease progression. Therefore, 
it is unclear whether it is cost-effective to use daratumumab in the first-line 
setting compared with reserving its use until later lines of therapy.
METHODS: We created a Markov model to compare healthcare costs and clinical 
outcomes of transplant-ineligible patients treated with daratumumab in the 
first-line setting compared with a strategy of reserving daratumumab until the 
second-line. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using 
parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated for first-line daratumumab versus second-line daratumumab from a US 
payer perspective.
RESULTS: First-line daratumumab was associated with an improvement of 0.52 QALYs 
and 0.66 discounted life-years compared with second-line daratumumab. While both 
treatment strategies were associated with considerable lifetime expenditures 
($1,434,937 v $1,112,101 in US dollars), an incremental cost of $322,836 for 
first-line daratumumab led to an ICER of $618,018 per QALY. The cost of 
daratumumab would need to be decreased by 67% for first-line daratumumab to be 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Using daratumumab in the first-line setting for 
transplant-ineligible patients may not be cost-effective under current pricing. 
Delaying daratumumab until subsequent lines of therapy may be a reasonable 
strategy to limit healthcare costs without significantly compromising clinical 
outcomes. Mature overall survival data are necessary to more fully evaluate 
cost-effectiveness in this setting.

Wireless sex toys are new technologies that enable sexual partners to connect 
remotely across long distances. Promoted as enhancing intimacy and pleasure as 
part of a healthy sex life, these devices buttress a 'sex for health' discourse 
which relies on the collection of intimate data purportedly used to improve 
current and subsequent teledildonics models. This article draws on two case 
studies of sex toys developed by leading sex-tech/teledildonic companies 
Lovense® and Kiiroo® to examine how the relationship between data and sexual 
subjectivity is being transformed through these emerging technologies. Applying 
concepts from new materialism, and extending the work of Faustino [(2018). 
Rebooting an old script by new means: Teledildonics-the technological return to 
the 'coital imperative'. Sexuality & Culture, 22, 243-257]', we explore how 
sexual practices, intimacy and pleasure become 'datafied' through these sensory 
technologies. Inspired by the concept of the 'sexuality-assemblage', we pose 
teledildonic-enhanced sex as a 'sexuotechnical-assemblage', a term that 
highlights the uniquely technological dimensions of sex in the age of 
teledildonics. Approaching these devices as sexuotechnical-assemblages 
highlights the generative role of data as lubricants of long-distance intimacy, 
and central actors in the (re)making of sexual subjects, and by extension, 
'healthy' sexuality.

This article is a discussion between two former colleagues and longstanding 
friends about the lived experience of illness and disability. In January 2013, 
Kirsten Harley, a promising early career sociologist was diagnosed with motor 
neurone disease (MND), a degenerative neurological condition with a typical life 
expectancy of 2-3 years. In this article, which is part interview and part 
shared reflection, we consider how Kirsten's knowledge of sociology has shaped 
her responses to the illness. We 'discuss' the process of meaning making, health 
system navigation, interactions with health professionals, advocacy, becoming a 
'passive activist', the role of technology and what we, as sociologists, might 
learn from a life so dramatically changed.

Screening of drug targets is critical to understand the mechanism of action of 
the drug. The aim of this study is to screen the drug-resistant target proteins 
of the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) by using chemical proteomics and to 
further study the interaction between MTX and its target protein in vitro and in 
vivo according to the principle of the increasing thermal stability of the 
target protein after binding with the drug molecule. The results showed that 21 
drug resistance related proteins of MTX including phosphoglycerate kinase 1 
(PGK1) were detected by quantitative proteomics. The expression of PGK1 
increased with the prolongation of incubation time of MTX, indicating PGK1 
protein is affected by MTX time dependently in cells. Further the results of the 
study on the interaction between MTX and PGK1 in vitro and in vivo using 
cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) showed that the level of PGK1 in 
MTX-treated groups was higher than that in the control group under the 
stimulation of higher temperature conditions, indicating that PGK1 has direct 
interactions with MTX. The present study provided the data and theoretical 
support for the study of the resistant target proteins of MTX and a novel point 
for the extension application of MTX.

PURPOSE: To report long-term outcome of fractionated stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) for painful spinal metastases.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter phase 2 
clinical trial enrolled 57 patients with 63 painful, unirradiated spinal 
metastases between March 2012 and July 2015. Patients were treated with 48.5 Gy 
in 10 SBRT fractions (long life expectancy [Mizumoto score ≤4]) or 35 Gy in 5 
SBRT fractions (intermediate life expectancy [Mizumoto score 5-9]). Pain 
response was defined as pain improvement of a minimum of 2 points on a visual 
analog scale, and net pain relief was defined as the sum of time with pain 
response (complete and partial) divided by the overall follow-up time.
RESULTS: All 57 patients received treatment per protocol; 32 and 25 patients 
were treated with 10- and 5-fraction SBRT, respectively. The median follow-up of 
living patients was 60 months (range, 33-74 months). Of evaluable patients, 82% 
had complete or partial pain response (responders) at 3 months' follow-up 
(primary endpoint), and pain response remained stable over 5 years. Net pain 
relief was 74% (95% CI, 65%-80%). Overall survival rates of 1, 3, and 5 years 
were 59.6% (95% CI, 47%-72%), 33.3% (95% CI, 21%-46%), and 21% (95% CI, 
10%-32%), respectively. Freedom from local spinal-metastasis progression was 82% 
at the last imaging follow-up. Late grade-3 toxicity was limited to pain in 2 
patients (nonresponders). There were no cases of myelopathy. SBRT resulted in 
long-term improvements of all dimensions of the 5-level EuroQol 5-Dimension 
Questionnaire except anxiety/depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Fractionated SBRT achieved durable pain response and improved 
quality of life at minimum late toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the leading 
contributors to disease burden. However, little is known about the spatial and 
temporal trends of the disease burden attributable to PM2.5 in the three major 
economies in East Asia. We aimed to estimate the patterns and temporal 
variations of the disease burden attributable to PM2.5 in China, Japan, and 
South Korea from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We obtained data on disease burden attributable to PM2.5 from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017. We retrieved the numbers and 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) rate (ASDR) of disease attributable to PM2.5 by age, sex, 
socio-demographic index (SDI), and country. We used percentage change and 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) to assess the trends of ASMR and ASDR 
attributable to PM2.5 between 1990 and 2017. We further calculated the 
contribution of population growth, population aging, and changes in mortality or 
DALYs rate to the net changes in total deaths and DALYs associated with PM2.5.
RESULTS: We found considerable differences in the disease burden attributable to 
PM2.5 in China, Japan, and South Korea. In 2017, the ASMR and ASDR of disease 
attributable to PM2.5 in China were 49.37 (95% UI: 41.18, 57.5) per 100,000 
population and 1065.9 (95% UI: 891.28, 1237.38) per 100,000 population, 
respectively, which was about four times higher than that of Japan and twice 
higher than that of South Korea. Regardless of country, the ASMR and ASDR were 
more pronounced among elders and males. From 1990 to 2017, the declines in ASMR 
and ASDR were more pronounced in Japan and South Korea than in China. The 
changes in PM2.5 associated total deaths and DALYs between 1990 and 2017 were 
the combined effects of population aging, population growth, and changes in 
mortality or DALY rate, resulting in a net increase in total deaths and DALYs in 
China but little changes in Japan and South Korea.
CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5 still contributed to significant disease burdens in 2017, 
although age-standardized disease burden has declined from 1990 to 2017. There 
has been an increasing trend in total deaths and DALYs in China, which was 
primarily driven by population aging.

High-Pressure Inactivation of Enzymes: A Review on Its Recent Applications on 
Fruit Purees and Juices.

In the last 2 decades high-pressure processing (HPP) has established itself as 
one of the most suitable nonthermal technologies applied to fruit products for 
the extension of shelf-life. Several oxidative and pectic enzymes are 
responsible for deterioration in color, flavor, and texture in fruit purees and 
juices (FP&J). The effect of HPP on the activities of polyphenoloxidase, 
peroxidase, β-glucosidase, pectinmethylesterase, polygalacturonase, 
lipoxygenase, amylase, and hydroperoxide lyase specific to FP&J have been 
studied by several researchers. In most of the cases, partial inactivation of 
the target enzymes was possible under the experimental domain, although their 
pressure sensitivity largely depended on the origin and their microenvironmental 
condition. The variable sensitivity of different enzymes also reflects on their 
kinetics. Several empirical models have been established to describe the 
kinetics of an enzyme specific to a FP&J. The scientific literature in the last 
decade illustrating the effects of HPP on enzymes in FP&J, enzymatic action on 
those products, mechanism of enzyme inactivation during high pressure, their 
inactivation kinetics, and several intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing 
the efficacy of HPP is critically reviewed in this article. In addition, process 
optimization of HPP targeting specific enzymes is of great interest from an 
industrial approach. This review will give a fair idea about the target enzymes 
specific to FP&J and the optimum conditions needed to achieve sufficient 
inactivation during HPP treatment.

Differences in How 12- and 24-Month-Olds Interpret the Gaze of Adults.

Moore C(1), Povinelli DJ(2).

This study examined the hypothesis that toddlers interpret an adult's head turn 
as evidence that the adult was looking at something, whereas younger infants 
interpret gaze based on an expectancy that an interesting object will be present 
on the side to which the adult has turned. Infants of 12 months and toddlers of 
24 months were first shown that an adult head turn to the side predicted the 
activation of a remote-controlled toy on that side of the room. After this 
connection had been demonstrated, participants were assigned to 2 conditions. In 
the head turn condition the toys were removed but the adult continued to produce 
head turns to the side. In the toy condition the adult stopped turning but the 
toys continued to be activated when the participant turned toward them. Results 
showed that, compared to 12-month-olds, 24-month-olds were more likely to 
continue to turn to the side when the adult continued to turn even though there 
was no longer anything of interest to see. In contrast, compared to 
24-month-olds, 12-month-olds were, if anything, more likely to continue to turn 
to the side in the condition in which the adult stopped turning. The latter 
result was replicated in a condition in which the activation of the toy was not 
contingent on the child's own head turn. These results imply that the meaning of 
gaze following may change significantly over the 2nd year of life. For 
12-month-olds, gaze is a useful predictor of where interesting sights may occur. 
In contrast, for 24-month-olds, gaze may be a signal that the adult is looking 
at something.

A Systematic Review of Sociodemographic, Macroeconomic, and Health Resources 
Factors on Life Expectancy.

Wirayuda AAB(1), Chan MF(1).

Author information:
(1)Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.

This review was aimed at systematically synthesizing and appraising the existing 
literature of sociodemographic, macroeconomic, and health resources factors on 
life expectancy. A systematic literature search of English databases, that is, 
PubMed/MEDLINE were scrutinized for exploring sociodemographic, macroeconomic, 
and health resources factors on life expectancy. The literature search was 
conducted in January 2020, covering a total of 46 articles from 2004 to 2019 met 
the review criteria, which were fully discussed subsequently. Among 
sociodemographic factors, infant mortality rate, literacy rate, education level, 
socioeconomic status, population growth, and gender inequality have a 
significant impact on life expectancy. Gross domestic product, Gini, income 
level, unemployment rate, and inflation rate are the main macroeconomic factors 
that significantly correlated with life expectancy. Among various health care 
resources, health care facilities, the number of the health care profession, 
public health expenditure, death rates, smoking rate, pollution, and 
vaccinations had a significant correlation with life expectancy. The systematic 
review showed general conformity of different studies, with a significant 
association between life expectancy and factors comprising several 
sociodemographic, macroeconomic, and various health care variables. This review 
found that only one study examined factors affecting life expectancy in Arabic 
countries. More studies on this region to fill this research gap were highly 
recommended.

The impact of pharmaceutical innovation on the longevity and hospitalization of 
New Zealand cancer patients, 1998-2017.

Lichtenberg FR(1).

Author information:

National Bureau of Economic Research, and CESifo Columbia University, New York, 
NY, USA.

BACKGROUND: We investigate whether the cancer sites that experienced more 
pharmaceutical innovation in New Zealand had larger subsequent declines in 
premature mortality and hospitalization rates and larger subsequent increases in 
5-year survival rates, controlling for changes in incidence.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We estimate the effects of the number of WHO ATC5 
chemical substances and ATC4 chemical subgroups approved on the number of years 
of potential life lost before ages 85, 75, 65, 5-year relative survival rates, 
and the number of inpatient hospital discharges, by estimating 
difference-in-differences (2-way fixed-effects) models using aggregate 
longitudinal data on 23 cancer sites.
RESULTS: Substances/subgroups approved during 1985-2001 reduced the number of 
years of potential life lost before age 85 (YPLL85) in 2017 by 67%. Those 
substances/subgroups reduced YPLL75 and YPLL65 in 2017 by similar percentages. 
The odds of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis are significantly 
positively related to the number of substances previously approved.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost per life-year before age 85 gained in 2017 from previous 
drug approvals did not exceed 1719 USD. The WHO considers interventions whose 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained is less than per capita GDP to be 
highly cost-effective; New Zealand's per capita GDP in 2017 was 42,260 USD. 
capita GDP in 2017 was 42,260 USD.
EXPERT OPINION: Pharmaceutical innovation-the introduction and use of new 
drugs-substantially increased cancer survival rates in New Zealand, and 
substantially reduced premature (before ages 85, 75, and 65) cancer mortality 
there during the period 1998-2017. Moreover, overall the new cancer drugs were 
highly costeffective. The drugs approved during 1985-2001 are estimated to have 
reduced the number of years of potential life lost before age 85 in 2017 by 
244,876. Even if previous drug approvals increased the cost of hospital 
discharges and other medical costs, the cost per life-year before age 85 gained 
in 2017 from those approvals could not have exceeded 1719 USD.

BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
cabazitaxel versus abiraterone or enzalutamide in patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with docetaxel 
who had progression within 12 months while receiving an alternative inhibitor 
(abiraterone or enzalutamide) from a US payer's perspective.
METHODS: To conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis, a Markov decision model was 
established. Three health states (progression-free survival (PFS), progressive 
disease (PD) and death) were included, and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was regarded as the primary endpoint. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold was set at $100,000.00/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and 
discounted rates were set at 3% annually. Efficacy data were derived from the 
CARD trial and Weibull distribution curves were modeled to fit the survival 
curves. The robustness of the analysis was tested with a series of one-way 
sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Overall, the incremental effectiveness and cost of cabazitaxel versus 
androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitors (ASTIs) were 0.16 QALYs and $49,487.03, 
respectively, which yielded an ICER of $309,293.94/QALY. Our model was mostly 
sensitive to the duration of PFS in the cabazitaxel group, cost of cabazitaxel 
and utility of the PFS state. At a WTP threshold of $100,000.00/QALY, 
cabazitaxel was the dominant strategy in 0% of the simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Cabazitaxel is unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment option 
compared with ASTIs in patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel who 
had progression within 12 months while receiving ASTIs.

Copenhagen, Ejegodvej 63, DK-4800 Nykøbing Falster, Copenhagen, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Lolland-Falster is a rural area of Denmark, where the life 
expectancy is presently almost six years lower than in the rich capital suburbs. 
To determine the origin of this disparity, we analysed changes in mortality 
during 50 years in Lolland-Falster.
METHODS: Annual population number and number of deaths at municipality level 
were retrieved from StatBank Denmark and from Statistics Denmark publications, 
1968-2017. For 1974-2017, life expectancy at birth by sex and 5-year calendar 
period was calculated. From 1968 to 2017, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for 
all-cause mortality was calculated by sex, 5-year calendar period and 
municipality, with Denmark as standard and including 95% confidence intervals 
(CI).
RESULTS: In 1968-2017, life expectancy in Lolland-Falster increased, but less so 
than in the rest of Denmark. Fifty years ago, Lolland-Falster had a mortality 
similar to the rest of Denmark. The increasing mortality disparity developed 
gradually starting in the late 1980s, earlier in Lolland municipality (western 
part) than in Guldborgsund municipality (eastern part), and earlier for men than 
for women. By 2013-2017, the SMR had reached 1.25 (95% CI 1.19-1.31) for men in 
the western part, and 1.11 (95% CI 1.08-1.16) for women in the eastern part. 
Increasing mortality disparity was particularly seen in people aged 20-69 years.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report on increasing geographical 
segregation in all-cause mortality in a Nordic welfare state. Development of the 
mortality disparity between Lolland-Falster and the rest of Denmark followed 
changes in agriculture, industrial company closure, a shipyard close-down, 
administrative centralisation, and a decreasing population size.
