Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but fatal disease. Current 
treatments increase life expectancy but have limited impact on the progressive 
pulmonary vascular remodelling that drives PAH. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is 
increased within serum and lesions of patients with idiopathic PAH and is a 
mitogen and migratory stimulus for pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells 
(PASMCs). Here, we report that the pro-proliferative and migratory phenotype in 
PASMCs stimulated with OPG is mediated via the Fas receptor and that treatment 
with a human antibody targeting OPG can attenuate pulmonary vascular remodelling 
associated with PAH in multiple rodent models of early and late treatment. We 
also demonstrate that the therapeutic efficacy of the anti-OPG antibody approach 
in the presence of standard of care vasodilator therapy is mediated by a 
reduction in pulmonary vascular remodelling. Targeting OPG with a therapeutic 
antibody is a potential treatment strategy in PAH.

With advances in medical care, many women with genetic conditions previously 
known to decrease life expectancy are reaching childbearing age. Thus, it is 
important to understand the management of patients in the preconception, 
antepartum, and postpartum periods as they pose a unique challenge to the 
obstetrician. Most rare disorders lack well-established clinical guidelines for 
management in pregnancy. Existing data stem from case reports, case series, and 
expert opinion. We aim to summarize these recommendations and develop a clinical 
reference for managing reproductive age women with these conditions. We review 
recommendations for women with inborn errors in metabolism, connective tissue 
disorders, skeletal dysplasia, and selected single gene disorders. In all cases, 
it is crucial to employ a multidisciplinary team to optimize care for patients 
with rare disease before, during, and immediately after their pregnancies. The 
emphasis on expert consensus recommendations in the guidance of obstetric care 
is a signal that more studies are needed to determine best practices.

Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are invasive mosquito species with geographic 
ranges that have oscillated within Florida since their presence was first 
documented. Local transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses serves 
as evidence of the public health importance of these two species. It is 
important to have detailed knowledge of their distribution to aid in mosquito 
control efforts and understand the risk of arbovirus transmission to humans. 
Through a partnership involving the University of Florida Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences Cooperative Extension Service and the Florida Medical 
Entomology Laboratory; the Florida Department of Health; and mosquito control 
agencies throughout Florida, a container mosquito surveillance program involving 
all life stages was launched in the summer of 2016 to detect the presence of Ae. 
aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Results from this survey were mapped to provide a 
picture of the current known distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in 
Florida. Aedes aegypti and/or Ae. albopictus were detected in the 56 counties 
that were part of the survey. Only Aedes albopictus was detected in 26 counties, 
primarily in the panhandle region of Florida. The results of this work 
underscore the importance of maintaining container mosquito surveillance in a 
state where chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses are present and where there is 
continued risk for exotic arbovirus introductions.

BACKGROUND: Identification and prevention of mobility limitations in older 
adults is important to reduce adverse health outcomes. The Life-Space Assessment 
(LSA) provides a single measure of mobility including environmental and social 
resources of the older adult. Availability of the LSA for non-English speaking 
countries is still sparse. Therefore, we translated the LSA into Danish and 
performed a content validity analysis of the translation in older adults with 
mobility limitations.
METHODS: After translation into Danish, the Danish version (LSA-DK) was content 
validated using cognitive interviewing in older mobility limited adults (+ 65) 
from an outpatient rehabilitation center (n = 12), medical wards at a university 
hospital (n = 11), and an assisted living facility (n = 7). The interviews were 
transcribed and analyzed according to the four stages of the Information 
Processing Model. Based on the analyses, recommendations for changes to the 
LSA-DK and to the manual were made and presented to the developers of the LSA.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached on the LSA-DK. Thirty cognitive interviews were 
carried out. A wide range of sources of error primarily related to the 
comprehension, memory and decision process were identified. The frequency and 
type of error sources were most prevalent among assisted living facility 
informants and included difficulties in defining the geographical extension of 
neighborhood, town and outside town. The results led to adaptations to the 
questionnaire and manual to support implementation of the LSA-DK in clinical 
practice.
CONCLUSIONS: The Life-Space Assessment was translated into Danish and content 
validated based on cognitive interviews. Adaptations were made to support that 
the Danish version can be implemented in clinical practice and used in the 
assessment of mobility in older Danish adults.

Compared With Those Without Sickle Cell Disease.

IMPORTANCE: Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have reduced life 
expectancy; however, there are limited data available on lifetime income in 
patients with SCD.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and 
income differences between a US cohort of patients with SCD and an age-, sex-, 
and race/ethnicity-matched cohort without SCD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort simulation modeling was used to (1) 
build a prevalent SCD cohort and a matched non-SCD cohort, (2) identify utility 
weights for quality-adjusted life expectancy, (3) calculate average expected 
annual personal income, and (4) model life expectancy, quality-adjusted life 
expectancy, and lifetime incomes for SCD and matched non-SCD cohorts. Data 
sources included the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National 
Newborn Screening Information System, and published literature. The target 
population was individuals with SCD, the time horizon was lifetime, and the 
perspective was societal. Model data were collected from November 29, 2017, to 
March 21, 2018, and the analysis was performed from April 28 to December 3, 
2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, 
and projected lifetime income.
RESULTS: The estimated prevalent population for the SCD cohort was 87 328 (95% 
uncertainty interval, 79 344-101 398); 998 were male and 952 were female. 
Projected life expectancy for the SCD cohort was 54 years vs 76 years for the 
matched non-SCD cohort; quality-adjusted life expectancy was 33 years vs 67 
years, respectively. Projected lifetime income was $1 227 000 for an individual 
with SCD and $1 922 000 for a matched individual without SCD, reflecting a lost 
income of $695 000 owing to the 22-year difference in life expectancy. One study 
limitation is that the higher estimates of life expectancy yielded conservative 
estimates of lost life-years and income. The analysis only considered the value 
of lost personal income owing to premature mortality and did not consider direct 
medical costs or other societal costs associated with excess morbidity (eg, lost 
workdays for disability, time spent in the hospital). The model was most 
sensitive to changes in income levels and mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulated cohort modeling study, SCD had 
societal consequences beyond medical costs in terms of reduced life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime earnings. These results 
underscore the need for disease-modifying therapies to improve the underlying 
morbidity and mortality associated with SCD.

BACKGROUND: Poor engagement in postpartum maternal HIV care is a challenge 
worldwide and contributes to adverse maternal outcomes and vertical 
transmission. Our objective was to project the clinical and economic impact of 
integrated postpartum maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) and pediatric care 
in South Africa.
METHODS: Using the CEPAC computer simulation models, parameterized with data 
from the Maternal and Child Health-Antiretroviral Therapy (MCH-ART) randomized 
controlled trial, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of integrated postpartum 
care for women initiating ART in pregnancy and their children. We compared two 
strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC) referral to local clinics after delivery 
for separate standard ART services for women and pediatric care for infants, and 
2) the MCH-ART intervention (MCH-ART) of co-located maternal/pediatric care 
integrated in Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services throughout breastfeeding. 
Trial-derived inputs included: 12-month maternal retention in care and virologic 
suppression (SOC: 49%, MCH-ART: 67%), breastfeeding duration (SOC: 6 months, 
MCH-ART: 8 months), and postpartum healthcare costs for mother-infant pairs 
(SOC: $50, MCH-ART: $69). Outcomes included pediatric HIV infections, maternal 
and infant life expectancy (LE), lifetime HIV-related per-person costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; ICER <US$903/YLS considered 
"cost-effective").
RESULTS: Compared to SOC, MCH-ART increased maternal LE (SOC: 25.26 years, 
MCH-ART: 26.20 years) and lifetime costs (SOC: $9,912, MCH-ART: $10,207; 
discounted). Projected pediatric outcomes for all HIV-exposed children were 
similar between arms, although undiscounted LE for HIV-infected children was 
shorter in SOC (SOC: 23.13 years, MCH-ART: 23.40 years). Combining discounted 
maternal and pediatric outcomes, the ICER was $599/YLS.
CONCLUSION: Co-located maternal HIV and pediatric care, integrated in MCH 
services throughout breastfeeding, is a cost-effective strategy to improve 
maternal and pediatric outcomes and should be implemented in South Africa.

The polysaccharide fraction of Bletilla ochracea (BOP) was isolated from its 
tubers, and purified by DEAE-52 Cellulose and Sephadex G-200 column 
chromatography. The structural features of BOP were analyzed by GC-MS, HPLP, 
FT-IR, methylation and NMR. The average molecular weight of BOP was 
approximately 4.9 × 105 Da, and the monosaccharide composition was 7.88:2.12 mix 
of mannose and glucose. The FT-IR and NMR analyses revealed the following 
linkage: 
[→(4-β-D-Man-1)4 → (4-β-D-Glc-1)2 → 4-2-O-acetyl-β-D-Man-1 → 4-β-D-Man-1 → 4-3-O-acetyl-β-D-Man-1 → 4-2-O-acetyl-β-D-Man-1→]. 
Although BOP had no effect on the proliferation rate of CT26 colon carcinoma 
cells, it significantly inhibited tumor xenograft growth in vivo by stimulating 
CD4+ T cell expansion in the spleen of the tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, 
BOP is a potent immunomodulatory agent that can be considered for anti-tumor 
therapy.

PURPOSE: Mortality rate for septic shock, despite advancements in knowledge and 
treatment, remains high. Treatment includes administration of broad-spectrum 
antibiotics and stabilization of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) with 
intravenous fluid resuscitation. Fluid-refractory shock warrants vasopressor 
initiation. There is a paucity of evidence regarding the timing of vasopressor 
initiation and its effect on patient outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-centered, cohort study 
included patients with septic shock from January 2017 to July 2017. Time from 
initial hypotension to vasopressor initiation was measured for each patient. The 
primary outcome was 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: Of 530 patients screened,119 patients were included. There were no 
differences in baseline patient characteristics. Thirty-day mortality was higher 
in patients who received vasopressors after 6 h (51.1% vs 25%, p < .01). 
Patients who received vasopressors within the first 6 h had more 
vasopressor-free hours at 72 h (34.5 h vs 13.1, p = .03) and shorter time to MAP 
of 65 mmHg (1.5 h vs 3.0, p < .01).
CONCLUSION: Vasopressor initiation after 6 h from shock recognition is 
associated with a significant increase in 30-day mortality. Vasopressor 
administration within 6 h was associated with shorter time to achievement of MAP 
goals and higher vasopressor-free hours within the first 72 h.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical deformity (CD) is difficult to define due to the high 
variability in normal cervical alignment based on postural- and 
thoracolumbar-driven changes to cervical alignment. The purpose of this study 
was to identify whether patterns of sagittal deformity could be established 
based on neutral and dynamic alignment, as shown on radiographs.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of a prospective, multicenter 
database of CD patients who underwent surgery from 2013 to 2015. Their 
radiographs were reviewed by 12 individuals using a consensus-based method to 
identify severe sagittal CD. Radiographic parameters correlating with 
health-related quality of life were introduced in a two-step cluster analysis (a 
combination of hierarchical cluster and k-means cluster) to identify patterns of 
sagittal deformity. A comparison of lateral and lateral extension radiographs 
between clusters was performed using an ANOVA in a post hoc analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 75 patients were identified as having severe CD due to 
sagittal malalignment, and they formed the basis of this study. Their mean age 
was 64 years, their body mass index was 29 kg/m2, and 66% were female. There 
were significant correlations between focal alignment/flexibility of maximum 
kyphosis, cervical lordosis, and thoracic slope minus cervical lordosis (TS-CL) 
flexibility (r = 0.27, 0.31, and -0.36, respectively). Cluster analysis revealed 
3 distinct groups based on alignment and flexibility. Group 1 (a pattern 
involving a flat neck with lack of compensation) had a large TS-CL mismatch 
despite flexibility in cervical lordosis; group 2 (a pattern involving focal 
deformity) had focal kyphosis between 2 adjacent levels but no large regional 
cervical kyphosis under the setting of a low T1 slope (T1S); and group 3 (a 
pattern involving a cervicothoracic deformity) had a very large T1S with a 
compensatory hyperlordosis of the cervical spine.
CONCLUSIONS: Three distinct patterns of CD were identified in this cohort: flat 
neck, focal deformity, and cervicothoracic deformity. One key element to 
understanding the difference between these groups was the alignment seen on 
extension radiographs. This information is a first step in developing a 
classification system that can guide the surgical treatment for CD and the 
choice of fusion level.

OnobotulintoxinA (OBT-A) is a treatment option for Chronic Migraine (CM). It 
works on central sensitization and pain but its mode of action is still unknown. 
To observe how OBT-A treatment works on single migraine attacks, this paper 
covers an over-6-month observation period through self-reported smartphone 
application data. This was an observational, open-label cohort study conducted 
on 34 CM patients under OBT-A treatment, selected between December 2016 and 
December 2017, who agreed to download a smartphone headache diary application 
(Aid Diary) according to the study instructions. The analysis was conducted 
using the smartphone application data reports on allodynia, intensity and 
extension of pain, and vegetative symptoms. We analysed a total of 707 records 
of single migraine attacks reported by compliant users (n = 34) in real-time. 
OBT-A significantly reduced allodynia, the number of vegetative symptoms, pain 
extension and intensity in single migraine attacks. Pain intensity was 
correlated with pain extension. In single migraine attacks, OBT-A improved 
symptoms of central sensitization. This action could be exerted by modulating 
nociceptive transmission and reducing the burden of single migraine episodes and 
improving the overall quality of life.

Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

In the United States, one out of every 500 African American children have sickle 
cell disease (SCD), and SCD affects approximately 100,000 Americans. Significant 
advances in the treatment of this monogenetic disorder have failed to 
substantially extend the life expectancy of adults with SCD over the past two 
decades. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only 
curative option for patients with SCD. While human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
matched sibling HSCT has been successful, its availability is extremely limited. 
This review summarizes various conditioning regimens that are currently 
available. We explore recent efforts to expand the availability of allogeneic 
HSCT, including matched unrelated, umbilical cord blood, and haploidentical stem 
cell sources. We consider the use of nonmyeloablative conditioning and 
haploidentical donor sources as emerging strategies to expand transplant 
availability, particularly for SCD patients with complications and comorbidities 
who can undergo neither matched related transplant nor myeloablative 
conditioning. Finally, we show that improved conditioning agents have improved 
success rates not only in the HLA-matched sibling setting but also alternative 
donor settings.

In our previous study, we produced α-keto acids by using an L-amino acid 
deaminase PmiLAAD (wide-type) from Proteus mirabilis, however, the catalytic 
efficiency was low due to its low substrate affinity. In this study, protein 
engineering of PmiLAAD was performed to improve the α-keto acid production. 
PmiLAAD was engineered by iterative CASTing to improve its catalytic 
performance. The four mutant PmiLAAD-SAVS (PmiLAAD-Phe93Ser-Pro186Ala- 
Met394Val-Phe184Ser) with 6.6 -fold higher specific activity compared with that 
of wild-type PmiLAAD has been obtained by high-throughput screening. Comparative 
kinetics analysis showed that the four mutant PmiLAAD-SAVS had a higher 
substrate-binding affinity and catalytic efficiency than that of PmiLAAD 
wild-type. The Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values of the PmiLAAD(SAVS) variant was 
better (-42.7%, 75.11%, and 85.79%, respectively) than the corresponding values 
of PmiLAAD wild type. Finally, the whole cell biocatalyst E. 
coli-pETDuet-1-PmiLAAD(SAVS) has been applied to α-keto acids production. The 
conversion rate of L-phenylalanine reached 99% by whole-cell biocatalyst E. 
coli-pETDuet-1-PmiLAAD(SAVS). The conversion of (D/L)-4-phenylalanine was 
reached 49.5% after 7 h by whole-cell biocatalyst E. 
coli-pETDuet-1-PmiLAAD(SAVS), while the conversion of E. coli-pETDuet-1-PmiLAAD 
(wild type) was only 18% after an extension of the reaction time (24 h). This 
study has developed a robust whole-cell E. coli biocatalyst for α-keto acids 
production by protein engineering, and this strategy may be useful for the 
construction of other biotransformation biocatalysts.

Sugar reduction in bakery products: Current strategies and sourdough technology 
as a potential novel approach.

The world is facing a big problem of non-communicable diseases, such as obesity, 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. An excessive sugar consumption is 
considered as a main factor, which triggers these diseases. The two main sources 
of sugar in processed products on the market are sugar-sweetened beverages and 
sweet bakery products. Sugar reduction is challenging, especially in baked 
goods, since it interacts significantly with all ingredients. These interactions 
cause an increase in gelatinization temperature, a delay in gluten network 
development, an increase or decrease in yeast activity depending on the sugar 
concentration, as well as an enhancement of emulsification. Reflecting the 
molecular interactions on the product quality characteristics of different types 
of baked goods, sugar also contributes to browning reactions and extension of 
microbial shelf life. During cake preparation, sugar supports the batter 
aeration which results in the typical soft cake crumb. Furthermore, it 
contributes to the spreading process of biscuits during baking and enhances 
surface cracking due to recrystallization. Sugar reduction requires the 
development of different strategies; Two well-known strategies are the 
replacement of added sugar by the combination of bulking agents and 
high-intensive sweeteners, or by sweet bulking ingredients, such as polyols. The 
in-situ production of polyols to enhance sweetness, and exopolysaccharides to 
improve texture, in a sourdough system shows high potential as sugar 
replacement. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and 
Leuconostoc citreum are high mannitol producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 
strains with yields of 70-98% and Leuconostoc oenos was found to produce 
erythritol. Furthermore, the yeast strain Candida milleri isolated from 
sourdough produces xylitol in the presence of xylose. Exopolysaccharides 
produced by LAB and/or yeasts are known to improve the texture and structure of 
bakery products and, thus, have high potential as natural functional ingredients 
to compensate quality loss in sweet bakery goods.

The objective of this study was to determine the long-term (>1 year) 
electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical outcomes of patients without significant 
changes in their electrocardiogram after transcatheter aortic valve implantation 
(TAVI; including patients with pre-existing ECG abnormalities). Among 772 
consecutive patients who underwent TAVI in our institution, 397 patients (51%) 
without new ECG changes were included. TAVI patients were divided into 2 groups 
according to the presence of pre-existing ECG-conduction disturbances (ECG-CD: 
140 patients, non-ECG-CD: 257 patients). Clinical follow-up (median: 35 [22 to 
57] months) was complete in all patients but 5 (1.2%), and ECG data were 
available in 291 patients (84.3% of patients at risk) at a median of 29 (20 to 
50) months. In the non-ECG-CD group, most patients (79.8%) remained without 
significant ECG changes at follow-up, and 16.9% developed first-degree 
atrioventricular block and/or bundle branch block over time. The rate of 
permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation at follow-up was 3.5% (1.1%/year) in the 
non-ECG-CD group versus 15.7% (5.5%/year) in the ECG-CD group (p <0.001). The 
presence of pre-existing CD was an independent predictor of PPM at follow-up 
(hazard ratio [HR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.15 to 10.16, p <0.001). 
The ECG-CD group exhibited a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization 
(non-ECG-CD: 25%, ECG-CD: 29%, log-rank p = 0.01), but not mortality 
(non-ECG-CD: 50%, ECG-CD: 46%, log-rank p = 0.60) at 5-year follow-up. In 
conclusion, the ECG remained unchanged in most TAVI recipients without new 
postprocedural CD. Pre-existing ECG-CD was associated with an increased risk of 
PPM and heart failure hospitalization at long-term follow-up. These results 
provide reassuring data in the era of TAVI expanding toward candidates with a 
longer life expectancy, and highlight the importance of a closer follow-up of 
those patients with pre-existing ECG-CDs.

177Lu-PSMA-617 is a radioligand with high affinity for prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA), enabling targeted β-irradiation of prostate cancer. We 
have previously reported favorable activity with low toxicity in a prospective 
phase II trial involving 30 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer. We now report their longer-term outcomes, including a 20-patient 
extension cohort and outcomes of subsequent systemic treatments after completion 
of trial therapy. Methods: Fifty patients with PSMA-avid metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer who had progressed after standard therapies 
received up to 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA every 6 wk. Endpoints included 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2), 
toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03), imaging 
response, patient-reported health-related quality of life, progression-free 
survival, and overall survival. We also describe, as a novel finding, outcomes 
of men who subsequently progressed and had further systemic therapies, including 
177Lu-PSMA. Results: Seventy-five men were screened to identify 50 patients 
eligible for treatment. Adverse prognostic features of the cohort included short 
median PSA doubling time (2.3 mo) and extensive prior treatment, including prior 
docetaxel (84%), cabazitaxel (48%), and abiraterone or enzalutamide (92%). The 
mean administered radioactivity was 7.5 GBq/cycle. A PSA decline of at least 50% 
was achieved in 32 of 50 patients (64%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 50%-77%), 
including 22 patients (44%; 95% CI, 30%-59%) with at least an 80% decrease. Of 
27 patients with measurable soft-tissue disease, 15 (56%) achieved an objective 
response by RECIST 1.1. The most common toxicities attributed to 177Lu-PSMA were 
self-limiting G1-G2 dry mouth (66%), transient G1-G2 nausea (48%), G3-G4 
thrombocytopenia (10%), and G3 anemia (10%). Brief Pain Inventory severity and 
interference scores decreased at all time points, including at the 3-mo 
follow-up, with a decrease of -1.2 (95% CI, -0.5 to -1.9; P = 0.001) and -1.0 
(95% CI, -0.2 to -0.18; P = 0.013), respectively. At a median follow-up of 31.4 
mo, median overall survival was 13.3 mo (95% CI, 10.5-18.7 mo), with a 
significantly longer survival of 18.4 mo (95% CI, 13.8-23.8 mo) in patients 
achieving a PSA decline of at least 50%. At progression after prior response, 
further 177Lu-PSMA was administered to 15 (30%) patients (median of 2 cycles 
commencing 359 d from enrollment), with a PSA decline of at least 50% in 11 
patients (73%). Four of 21 patients (19%) receiving other systemic therapies on 
progression experienced a PSA decline of at least 50%. There were no unexpected 
adverse events with 177Lu-PSMA retreatment. Conclusion: This expanded 50-patient 
cohort of men with extensive prior therapy confirms our earlier report of high 
response rates, low toxicity, and improved quality of life with 177Lu-PSMA 
radioligand therapy. On progression, rechallenge 177Lu-PSMA demonstrated higher 
response rates than other systemic therapies.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal research evaluates many different outcomes using multiple 
measures. This can prevent synthesis of trial results in meta-analyses, and 
selected outcomes may not be relevant to former patients, parents and health 
professionals.
OBJECTIVE: To define a core outcome set (COS) for research involving infants 
receiving neonatal care in a high-income setting.
DESIGN: Outcomes reported in neonatal trials and qualitative studies were 
systematically reviewed. Stakeholders were recruited for a three-round 
international Delphi survey. A consensus meeting was held to confirm the final 
COS, based on the survey results.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and fourteen former patients, parents, healthcare 
professionals and researchers took part in the eDelphi survey; 173 completed all 
three rounds. Sixteen stakeholders participated in the consensus meeting.
RESULTS: The literature reviews identified 104 outcomes; these were included in 
round 1. Participants proposed 10 additional outcomes; 114 outcomes were scored 
in rounds 2 and 3. Round 1 scores showed different stakeholder groups 
prioritised contrasting outcomes. Twelve outcomes were included in the final 
COS: survival, sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, brain injury on imaging, 
general gross motor ability, general cognitive ability, quality of life, adverse 
events, visual impairment/blindness, hearing impairment/deafness, retinopathy of 
prematurity and chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A COS for clinical trials and other research studies 
involving infants receiving neonatal care in a high-income setting has been 
identified. This COS for neonatology will help standardise outcome selection in 
clinical trials and ensure these are relevant to those most affected by neonatal 
care.

OBJECTIVE: Screening psoriasis patients for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is 
intended to identify patients at earlier stages of the disease. Early treatment 
is expected to slow disease progression and delay the need for biologic therapy. 
Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening for PsA in 
patients with psoriasis in Canada.
METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) of screening tools for PsA in psoriasis patients. The 
screening tools included the Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Screen, Psoriasis 
Epidemiology Screening Tool, Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation, and 
Early Psoriatic Arthritis Screening Questionnaire (EARP) questionnaires. States 
of health were defined by disability levels as measured by the Health Assessment 
Questionnaire. State transitions were modeled based on annual disease 
progression. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental net monetary 
benefits were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for 
parameter uncertainty and to test model assumptions.
RESULTS: Screening was cost-effective compared to no screening. The EARP tool 
had the lowest total cost ($2,000 per patient per year saved compared to no 
screening) and the highest total QALYs (additional 0.18 per patient compared to 
no screening). The results were most sensitive to test accuracy and the efficacy 
of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). No screening was 
cost-effective (at $50,000 per QALY) relative to screening when DMARDs failed to 
slow disease progression.
CONCLUSION: If early therapy with DMARDs delays biologic treatment, implementing 
screening in patients with psoriasis in Canada is expected to represent a cost 
savings of $220 million per year and improve the quality of life.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that, if 
untreated, can lead to disability and reduce the life expectancy of affected 
patients. Over the last two decades the improvement of knowledge of the 
pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the development of the disease has profoundly 
changed the treatment strategies of RA through the development of 
biotechnological drugs (bDMARDs) directed towards specific pro-inflammatory 
targets involved in the RA network. To date, the therapeutic armamentarium for 
RA includes ten bDMARDs able to produce the depletion B-cells, the blockade of 
three different pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha, 
interleukin-6 and interleukin-1), or the inhibition of T-cell co-stimulation. 
The introduction of these new compounds has dramatically improved outcomes in 
the short and long term, although still a significant proportion of patients are 
unable to reach or maintain the treatment target over time. The identification 
of the fundamental role of Janus kinases in the process of transduction of the 
inflammatory signal within the immune cells has recently provided the 
opportunity to use the new pharmacological class of small molecules for the 
therapy of RA, further increasing the number of treatment options. In this 
review the PROS and CONS of these two drug classes will be discussed, trying to 
provide the evidence currently available to make the right choice based on the 
analysis of the efficacy and safety profile of the different drugs on the market 
and close to marketing.
