increased life expectancy, (2) the continued expansion of surgical indications, 
(3) an increase in difficult surgeries, and (4) the constant emergence and 
application of new implantable biomaterials and other therapies. Thus, there is 
a pressing clinical need to improve the therapy of iatrogenic wounds. However, 
the difficulty in treating these wounds is considerable due to the emergence of 
drug-resistant bacteria, the high number of patients with metabolic diseases, 
and complex complications in patients. In particular, iatrogenic wounds caused 
by surgical site infections due to implantable biomaterials could lead to 
material leakage and conflicts regarding whether to retain or remove the 
implants. This review provides a definition of iatrogenic wounds, describes 
their characteristics, classifies them, and provides information about the 
importance of analyzing iatrogenic wounds. We hope that this review will provide 
useful information for the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic wounds and help 
to reduce their incidence in the future.

BACKGROUND: The gender gap in life expectancy is documented worldwide with lower 
life expectancy in male new-borns. International studies have shown that the 
gender gap in life expectancy varies markedly with gender inequality.
OBJECTIVES: The paper addresses the questions: (1) whether there are 
life-expectancy differences between the federal states and whether the extent of 
gender equality at federal level is associated with (2) gender differences in 
life expectancy and (3) the life expectancy of women and men.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Gender Inequality Index (GII) developed by the United 
Nations Development Project was calculated using data from the federal states. 
Using linear regressions, GII was associated with the gender gap in life 
expectancy as well as with life expectancy in males and females.
RESULTS: The GII varies between 0.065 (Bavaria) and 0.117 
(Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) and the gender gap in life expectancy differs by almost 
two years within Germany. We found a correlation between the gender difference 
in life expectancy and GII (R2 linear = 0.848) as well as between GII and life 
expectancy of male (R2 linear = 0.700), but not female newborns (R2 
linear = 0.102). The association remains if GDP is taken into account as an 
indicator of economic power.
CONCLUSIONS: Gender equality seems to be positively related to the life 
expectancy of men. This can be explained by the reduced importance of male 
gender stereotypes and associated risk behaviors. The requirements for 
gender-differentiated interventions formulated in the Prevention Act 
(Präventionsgesetz) are highly significant.

In addition to sugars, nectar contains multiple nutrient compounds in varying 
concentrations, yet little is known of their effect on the reward properties of 
nectar and the resulting implications for insect behaviour. We examined the 
pre-ingestive responses of honeybees to sucrose solutions containing a mix of 
pollen compounds, the amino acids proline or phenylalanine, or known distasteful 
substances, quinine and salt. We predicted that in taste and learning assays, 
bees would respond positively to the presence of nutrient compounds in a sucrose 
solution. However, bees' proboscis extension responses decreased when their 
antennae were stimulated with pollen- or amino acid-supplemented sucrose 
solutions. Compared to pure sucrose, bees exhibited worse acquisition when 
conditioned to an odour with pollen-supplemented sucrose as the unconditioned 
stimulus. Such learning impairment was also observed with quinine-containing 
sucrose solutions. Our results suggest that bees can use their antennae to 
detect pollen compounds in floral nectars. Depending on the type and 
concentrations of compounds present, this may result in nectar being perceived 
as distasteful by bees, making it less effective in reinforcing the learning of 
floral cues. Such reward devaluation might be adaptive in cases where plants 
benefit from regulating the frequency of bee visitation.

[Diagnostics in very old patients; when to apply it or not in cases of suspected 
malignancy?].

This paper focuses on considerations regarding diagnostics in case of a 
suspected malignancy in a very old or frail patient. The patient's preference 
and life-perspective lie at the core of shared decision-making. From a medical 
point of view, the estimated life-expectancy may be so short that further 
diagnostic testing for a malignancy may only be useful when there are treatable 
symptoms in play. In other cases, prior to diagnostics there may already be a 
suspicion that there will be no feasible oncologic treatment options. From the 
perspective of advance care planning and symptomatic treatment, it can 
nonetheless still be useful to confirm the presence of a malignancy through 
imaging diagnostics. Obtaining tissue for further specification in very old or 
frail patients is only useful when an easily tolerated, yet effective treatment 
is likely or possible, such as endocrine treatment in case of prostate cancer or 
breast cancer.

Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

IMPORTANCE: In October 2018, evolocumab was made available at a reduced annual 
list price of $5850 in the United States. This 60% reduction was aimed at 
improving patient access by lowering patient copays. Shortly thereafter, the 
2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol 
management guideline was released. An updated cost-effectiveness analysis of 
evolocumab in the United States may be therefore of interest to payers and 
prescribers.
OBJECTIVE: To present an updated cost-effectiveness analysis of evolocumab added 
to standard background therapy compared with standard background therapy alone 
in patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 
reflecting the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline definition and using the new evolocumab 
list price.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used the Markov model originally 
used in a previous study by Fonarow et al in 2017. A US societal perspective was 
considered, and a range of baseline cardiovascular event rates were modeled to 
reflect varying risk profiles in clinical practice within patients with very 
high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
EXPOSURES: Addition of evolocumab to standard background therapy, including 
maximally tolerated statin therapy (ie, the maximum intensity of statin therapy 
a patient can safely receive), with or without ezetimibe.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, 
ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death), costs, quality-adjusted life-years, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Evolocumab was associated with both increased costs and improved 
outcomes when added to standard background therapy. Incremental costs ranged 
from $22 228 to $3411, depending on the varying level of risk within the defined 
population. Incremental quality-adjusted life years ranged from 0.39 to 0.44. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $56 655 to $7667 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. For a range of baseline cardiovascular event 
rates in patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below the generally accepted 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. Moreover, the ratios were below the threshold of 
$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained for any baseline rate of 6.9 or 
more events per 100 patient-years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: At its current list price, the addition of evolocumab 
to standard background therapy meets accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds 
across a range of baseline cardiovascular event rates in patients with very 
high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as defined by the 2018 ACC/AHA 
guideline.

BACKGROUND: The staging method for activities of daily living (ADLs) limitations 
developed by Stineman and colleagues that classifies people into five stages can 
reflect severity of activity limitations.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of stages of limitations in ADLs on 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the relative severity of each ADL 
limitation for a large, nationally-representative sample of the U.S. 
community-dwelling older population.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Limited Dataset of the Medicare Health 
Outcomes Survey Cohort 15 (2012 baseline survey, 2014 follow-up survey). We 
included respondents aged ≥65 years (n = 105,473). We estimated expected QALYs 
throughout the remaining lifetime of participants stratified by the ADL 
limitation status and stages of ADL limitations.
RESULTS: Overall, the expected QALYs was 5.6 years. QALYs decreased with 
increasing stages of ADL limitations. The adjusted QALYs for Stage 0 (no 
limitation) participants were 6.8; for Stage I (mild) participants, 3.9; for 
Stage II (moderate) participants, 2.2; for Stage III (severe) participants, 1.8; 
and for Stage IV (complete limitations) participants, 1.5. Differences in QALYs 
occurred between individual ADL items within an ADL stage. In Stage I, for 
example, participants who reported only problems with getting in or out of 
chairs had 6.7 QALYs which was markedly higher than participants who reported 
only problems with walking (3.8 QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional evidence that Stineman's ADL stages 
serve as valid estimates of the overall health of elderly Americans. 
Self-reported ADL status should be routinely collected as a patient-reported 
outcome in the elderly population.

Advances in Tetravirus Research: New Insight Into the Infectious Virus Lifecycle 
and an Expanding Host Range.

Tetraviruses are a group of relatively unknown small RNA viruses with particles 
that display a characteristic T=4 capsid architecture. Tetraviruses are 
classified into three families, the Alphatetraviridae, Permutotetraviridae and 
Carmotetraviridae, according to the divergent characteristics of their 
respective viral replicases. Tetraviruses generally infect the larvae of 
lepidopteran insect species, many of which are important agricultural pests and, 
until recently, were thought to have an unusually narrow host range and tissue 
tropism. The development of experimental systems for studying the viral 
infectious life cycle in tissue culture has permitted the extension of the virus 
host range to mammalian cells and plants. This chapter will review recent 
advances in the understanding of the biology of tetraviruses, highlighting new 
information on the expression and functional characterisation of viral proteins 
and the development of biological systems for elucidating the molecular 
mechanisms of infection, viral replication and host range.

Advanced prostate cancer cells preferentially metastasize to bone by acquiring a 
bone phenotype that allows metastatic cells to thrive in the skeletal 
environment. Identification of factors that promote the expression of ectopic 
bone genes-process known as osteomimicry-leading to tumor progression is crucial 
to prevent and treat metastatic prostate cancer and prolong life expectancy for 
patients. Here, we identify the extracelular matrix protein mindin in the 
secretome of prostate adenocarcinoma cells and show that mindin overexpression 
in human and mouse TRAMP-C1-induced prostate tumors correlates with upregulated 
levels of bone-related genes in the tumorigenic prostate tissues. Moreover, 
mindin silencing decreased osteomimicry in adenocarcinoma cells and in the 
prostate tumor mice model, as well as reduced tumor cell proliferation, 
migration and adhesion to bone cells. Inhibition of the extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) phosphorylation decreased the 
proliferative, migratory and pro-adhesion actions of mindin on prostate tumor 
cells. In addition, conditioned media obtained by crosstalk stimulation of 
either osteocytes or osteoblasts with the secretome of TRAMP-C1 cells promoted 
osteomimicry in prostate tumor cells; an effect inhibited by mindin silencing of 
TRAMP-C1 cells. In vivo, tibiae of primary tumor-bearing mice overexpressed the 
pro-angiogenic and pro-metastattic factor vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in a mindin-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that 
mindin is a novel regulator of osteomimicry in prostate tumors and potentially 
mediates tumor-bone cell crosstalk, suggesting its promising role as a target to 
inhibit bone metastases.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Third-line treatment options for patients with 
chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia include tyrosine kinase inhibitors and 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). The objective of 
this study was to develop a Markov model with a lifetime time horizon to assess 
the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for third-line chronic-phase chronic myeloid 
leukemia vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, 
bosutinib) or alloHSCT from the public healthcare system perspective in Germany, 
Sweden, and Canada.
METHODS: Clinical outcomes were derived from the literature, and from 
patient-level data (phase II PACE trial) for ponatinib. Resource use included 
drugs, alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; 
costs were based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
calculated using chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an 
international time-trade-off study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per 
annum for Germany and Sweden, and 5% for Canada.
RESULTS: Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any second-generation 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly owing to 
better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, 
and $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in 
Germany, while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT 
in Sweden and Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib may improve outcomes (mainly because of higher response 
rates and longer response durations) at an acceptable cost level compared with 
other third-line treatment options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in 
Germany, Sweden, and Canada; however, the lack of an indirect comparison is a 
limitation of our study.

INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists represent a 
class of treatments for type 2 diabetes that offer multifactorial benefits, 
including glycemic control, weight loss and low hypoglycemia risk. Once-weekly 
semaglutide is a novel GLP-1 analog that has been associated with improved 
glycemic control and reduced body mass index (BMI) versus once-weekly GLP-1 
receptor agonist dulaglutide in SUSTAIN 7, which is reimbursed in patients with 
a BMI > 35 kg/m2 in Slovakia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg versus 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg in Slovakia.
METHODS: Clinical and cost outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using 
the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment 
effects were based on the sub-group of patients with a BMI > 35 kg/m2 in SUSTAIN 
7. Patients were modeled to receive once-weekly semaglutide or dulaglutide for 
3 years, after which treatment was intensified to basal insulin. Treatment 
effects associated with once-weekly semaglutide and dulaglutide were maintained 
for the first 3 years before HbA1c increased to 7.0% and BMI reverted to 
baseline. Costs were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective in Slovakia 
and expressed in euros (EUR). Utilities relating to quality of life were taken 
from published sources.
RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with 
improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 
0.07 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, versus dulaglutide 
1.5 mg. Lifetime medical costs were similar, with cost savings of EUR 20 and 
EUR 140 per patient with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively, 
versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Both doses of once-weekly semaglutide were therefore 
considered dominant versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg.
CONCLUSION: Both doses of once-weekly semaglutide represent cost-saving 
treatment options versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg for obese patients with type 2 
diabetes in Slovakia.

Cholestatic liver diseases encompass a broad spectrum of pathologies, with the 
core injury occurring at the level of cholangiocytes and progressing to hepatic 
fibrosis and liver dysfunction. Primary biliary cholangitis and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis are the most significant progressive cholangiopathies in 
adults. Although rare, they commonly evolve to liver failure and need for liver 
transplantation. Despite recent advances in the basic knowledge of these 
cholangiopathies, the pathogenesis is still elusive. Targeted treatments to 
prevent disease progression and to preclude malignancy are not yet available. 
This review will address the general clinical features of both diseases, analyze 
their commonalities and differences, and provide a state-of-the art overview of 
the currently available therapeutics.

A Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Patellar Tendon, Hamstring Tendon, and 
Double-Bundle ACL Reconstructions: Patient-Reported and Clinical Outcomes at 
5-Year Follow-up.

BACKGROUND: This randomized clinical trial evaluated the 5-year, 
disease-specific quality-of-life outcomes of patients treated for anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency with use of a patellar tendon, single-bundle 
quadruple-stranded hamstring, or double-bundle hamstring reconstruction.
METHODS: Patients (n = 110 per group; 183 male; 14 to 50 years of age) were 
randomly allocated to anatomically positioned ACL reconstruction with use of a 
patellar tendon graft (patellar tendon group; mean age, 28.7 years), 
quadruple-stranded hamstring tendon construct (hamstring tendon group; mean age, 
28.5 years), or double-bundle hamstring tendon construct (double-bundle group; 
mean age, 28.3 years). Computer-generated allocation with varied block 
randomization was performed intraoperatively. The 5-year primary outcome measure 
was the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Quality of Life (ACL-QOL) score, and 
secondary outcome measures included the International Knee Documentation 
Committee (IKDC) subjective score and objective grades, pivot shift assessment, 
range of motion, kneeling pain, Tegner activity scale, Cincinnati Occupational 
Rating Scale, complete traumatic reruptures, partial traumatic tears, total 
traumatic reinjuries, and atraumatic graft failures.
RESULTS: Three hundred and fifteen patients (95%) completed the 5-year follow-up 
(4 withdrawals, and 11 lost to follow-up). ACL-QOL scores increased 
significantly from baseline for all groups (p < 0.0001), but mean scores at 5 
years did not differ among the groups (p = 0.548): mean (and standard deviation) 
of 82.5 ± 17.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.0 to 86.0) for patellar tendon, 
83.9 ± 18.2 (95% CI, 80.3 to 87.4) for hamstring tendon, and 81.1 ± 19.3 (95% 
CI, 77.4 to 84.8) for double-bundle. The proportions of patients at 5 years with 
a pivot shift grade of ≥2 (12% for patellar tendon, 16% for hamstring tendon, 
and 22% for double-bundle; p = 0.149) and with normal and nearly normal knees 
per IKDC grade (87%, 82%, and 75% for the 3 groups, respectively; p = 0.093) 
trended in favor of patellar tendon reconstruction. No differences were seen for 
the IKDC subjective scores, knee range of motion including passive extension 
deficits, the single leg hop test, Cincinnati Occupational Rating scores, and 
Tegner activity levels. Kneeling pain was more common with patellar tendon 
reconstruction (10% of patients compared with 4% for hamstring tendon and 2% for 
double-bundle; p = 0.029). For hamstring tendon and double-bundle 
reconstructions, there were trends toward more complete traumatic reruptures (4% 
for patellar tendon, 10% for hamstring tendon, and 10% for double-bundle; p = 
0.145) and partial traumatic tears (0%, 5%, and 6%, respectively; p = 0.059), 
with significantly fewer combined traumatic reinjuries in the patellar tendon 
group (4 patients compared with 16 for hamstring tendon and 17 for 
double-bundle; p = 0.010). Atraumatic graft failure (pivot shift grade of ≥2) 
was found for 10% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, we found no significant difference in the 
quality-of-life outcome among the patellar tendon, hamstring tendon, and 
double-bundle techniques for ACL reconstruction. Significantly more patients in 
the hamstring tendon and double-bundle groups experienced traumatic graft 
reinjury compared with the patellar tendon group. There was a trend toward a 
higher percentage with normal and nearly normal IKDC grades in the patellar 
tendon group compared with hamstring tendon and double-bundle groups.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether exclusive breastfeeding 
or exclusive formula feeding is more cost-effective when a Canadian mother with 
HIV is adherent to antiretroviral therapy and has full virologic suppression.
DESIGN: Current Canadian guidelines recommend that mothers with HIV practice 
exclusive formula feeding. This contradicts the updated World Health 
Organization (WHO) guidelines which recommend that mothers with HIV should 
breastfeed for ≥12 months while receiving support for antiretroviral therapy 
adherence. Due to the economic and health risks and benefits associated with 
each modality, there remains expert disagreement on whether the WHO 
recommendations should be adopted in high-income countries.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and 
effectiveness (i.e., infant's quality-adjusted life years) of a hypothetical 
group of 1,000,000 initially healthy, HIV-negative infants, if the mother with 
HIV was on antiretroviral therapy with full virologic suppression and either 
exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive formula feeding. The model was developed 
from the economic perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health, taking into 
account direct costs associated with infant feeding modality as well as related 
indirect costs born out of the child's lifetime health outcomes. Uncertainties 
related to model parameters were evaluated using one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In comparison to exclusive formula feeding, exclusive breastfeeding was 
the dominant feeding modality (i.e., less costly and more effective) yielding 
cost-savings of $13,812 per additional quality-adjusted life year gained. 
Neither one-way nor probabilistic sensitivity analyses altered the conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risk of HIV transmission, exclusive breastfeeding was 
more cost-effective than exclusive formula feeding. These findings merit review 
of current infant feeding guidelines for mothers with HIV living in high-income 
countries.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Arterial hypertension is the leading preventable cause of 
cardiovascular disease worldwide. Effective European programs aiming to improve 
awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension are lacking.
RECENT FINDINGS: Europe is heading the statistics for hypertension prevalence 
and cardiovascular disease. On the one hand this predominance reflects the 
increasing life expectancy in European population, whereas on the other hand, it 
can be attributed to the sedentary lifestyle and the nutritional habits of 
wealthy societies. Despite its economic power, Europe also ranges among the 
regions with the lowest rates of hypertension awareness and control worldwide.
SUMMARY: The present study discusses the influence of medical inertia, 
insufficient patient education, contradictory recommendations from the European 
and independent national societies, the need for hypertension programs, as well 
as differences in health policies in Europe as potential factors that may 
contribute to this discrepancy.

Animal source foods (ASF) such as dairy, eggs, fish and meat are an important 
source of high-quality nutrients. Lack of ASF in diets can result in 
developmental disorders including stunting, anemia, poor cognitive and motor 
development. ASF are more effective in preventing stunting than other foods and 
promoting ASF consumption in low- and middle-income countries could help improve 
health, particularly among pregnant women and young children. Production and 
consumption of ASF are, however, also associated with potential food safety 
risks. Strengthening of food control systems, informed by quantitative 
assessments of the disease burden associated with ASF is necessary to meet 
global nutrition goals. We present the human disease burden associated with 13 
pathogens (bacteria and parasites) in ASF, based on an analysis of global burden 
of foodborne disease (FBD) estimates of the WHO Foodborne Disease Burden 
Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). The FBD burden of these pathogens was 
combined with estimates of the proportion of disease transmitted by eight main 
groups of ASF. Uncertainty in all estimates was accounted for by Monte Carlo 
simulation. In 2010, the global burden of ASF was 168 (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI 137-219) Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population, 
which is approximately 35% of the estimated total burden of FBD. Main pathogens 
contributing to this burden included non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Taenia 
solium, and Campylobacter spp. The proportion of FBD burden associated with ASF 
varied considerably between subregions and between countries within subregions. 
Likewise, the contribution of different pathogens and ASF groups varied strongly 
between subregions. Pathogens with a localized distribution included T. solium 
and fishborne trematodes. Pathogens with a global distribution included 
non-typhoidal S. enterica, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and 
Mycobacterium bovis. Control methods exist for many hazards associated with ASF, 
and their implementation is linked to economic development and effective food 
safety systems.

BACKGROUND: HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are produced in India at low 
cost. However, concerns surrounding reinfection and budgetary impact limit 
treatment scale-up in India. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budgetary 
impact of HCV treatment in India, including reinfection.
METHODS: A closed cohort Markov model of HCV disease progression, treatment, and 
reinfection was parameterized. We compared treatment by fibrosis stage (F2-F4 or 
F0-F4) to no treatment from a health care payer perspective. Costs (2017 USD$, 
based on India-specific data) and health utilities (in quality-adjusted life 
years, QALYs) were attached to each health state. We assumed DAAs with 90% 
sustained viral response at $900/treatment and 1%/year reinfection, varied in 
the sensitivity analysis from 0.1-15%. We deemed the intervention cost-effective 
if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) fell below India's per capita 
GDP ($1,709). We assessed the budgetary impact of treating all diagnosed 
individuals.
RESULTS: HCV treatment for diagnosed F2-F4 individuals was cost-saving (net 
costs -$2,881 and net QALYs 3.18/person treated; negative ICER) compared to no 
treatment. HCV treatment remained cost-saving with reinfection rates of 
15%/year. Treating all diagnosed individuals was likely cost-effective compared 
to delay until F2 (mean ICER $1,586/QALY gained, 67% of simulations falling 
under the $1,709 threshold) with 1%/year reinfection. For all scenarios, annual 
retesting for reinfection was more cost-effective than the current policy 
(one-time retest). Treating all diagnosed individuals and reinfections results 
in net costs of $445-1,334 million over 5 years (<0.25% of total health care 
expenditure over 5 years), and cost-savings within 14 years.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV treatment was highly cost-effective in India, despite 
reinfection. Annual retesting for reinfection was cost-effective, supporting a 
policy change towards more frequent retesting. A comprehensive HCV treatment 
scale-up plan is warranted in India.

Due to epidemiological and social changes related to the increase in the average 
life expectancy, hospital users are characterized by elderly chronic and 
comorbid patients who require recurrent hospitalizations often with disability 
outcomes. In this framework, an innovative clinical and management 
hospitalization model is the adequate answer to systematically promote the 
patient independence. Main features are interdisciplinary and integrated care 
pathways facing both disease and disability biologically and functionally 
diagnosed by ICD and ICF. The definition, personalization of pathways/protocols 
and outcome evaluation represent the foundations of this new model for patient 
care. The digitalization of hospital clinical data and medical knowledge make 
the model feasible and fitting the recent WHO guideline: recommendations on 
digital interventions for health system strengthening.

Publisher: A causa dei cambiamenti epidemiologici e della società legati 
all’aumento della aspettativa di vita i pazienti che afferiscono in ospedale 
sono generalmente più anziani, cronici e comorbidi e richiedono frequenti 
re-ospedalizzazioni spesso con esiti disabilitanti. In questo contesto un nuovo 
modello di ospedalizzazione innovativo sia dal punto di vista clinico che di 
management sembra essere la risposta adeguata per promuovere sistematicamente 
l’autonomia del paziente. Caratteristiche principali del modello sono 
l’interdisciplinarietà e percorsi di cura integrati che affrontino la malattia e 
la disabilità valutate con le classificazioni ICD e ICF. Le basi fondanti di 
questo nuovo modello di cura sono la definizione e la personalizzazione dei 
percorsi diagnostico terapeutici assistenziali (PDTA). La digitalizzazione dei 
dati clinici ospedalieri ricavati dai percorsi/protocolli rendono fattibile il 
modello e si allineano con le recenti line guida dell’OMS sulla digitalizzazione 
degli interventi nel rafforzare i sistemi sanitari.

Foodborne pathogens and occupational hazards are two primary safety concerns for 
U.S. beef slaughterhouses. The anthropogenic environmental impacts due to 
intensive resource use and pollution also exert threats to human health. 
Quantifying human health impacts from various sources remain a grand 
sustainability challenge for U.S. beef industry. We develop a framework to 
systematically estimate and compare human health impacts associated with U.S. 
beef foodborne illnesses from major pathogens and environmental impacts and 
occupational hazards from U.S. beef slaughtering on a common metric, 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Foodborne illnesses and occupational 
hazards are estimated by synthesizing published data and methodologies while 
environmental impacts are quantified using life cycle assessment. In spite of 
inherent uncertainties in estimation, results show that the environmental 
impacts and occupational hazards from beef slaughtering are of same magnitude 
with foodborne illnesses from beef consumption on human health. Salmonella and 
Clostridium perfringens contribute 51% and 28%, respectively, to the beef 
foodborne DALY; Global warming and fine particulate matter formation, due to 
electricity and natural gas use, are primary drivers for environmental DALY, 
accounting 62% and 28%, respectively. Occupational DALY is on average lower than 
environmental DALY from beef slaughtering and foodborne DALY. The impact of new 
food safety interventions that use additional resources to improve food safety 
should be considered jointly with environmental impacts and occupational hazards 
to avoid unintended shifts and net increase of human health impacts. The 
methodology and results from this study provide a new perspective on reforms of 
the U.S. food safety regulations building toward sustainability in the food 
processing industry.

BACKGROUND:  Patients with genetic aortic syndromes such as Marfan or 
Loeys-Dietz syndrome have a decreased life expectancy due to the risk of aortic 
dissection and rupture. Imaging plays an important role in the acute setting but 
also in the initial diagnosis and image-based monitoring. In this article, we 
provide an overview of the most common genetic aortic syndromes and recommended 
imaging strategies. Furthermore, we highlight modern imaging methods allowing 
for the quantification of hemodynamic changes in aortic disease.
METHOD:  This is a narrative review article on genetic aortic syndromes and 
recommended imaging strategies, where we take into account expert opinions and 
standard-of-care practices from our own center.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:  Radiological imaging plays a key role in the initial 
diagnosis and surveillance of patients with genetic aortic syndromes. 
Radiologists contribute significantly to the multi-disciplinary setting of 
genetic aortic syndromes with knowledge of special features and recommended 
imaging methods. Accurate measurement of the aorta is crucial, particularly in 
terms of diameter-based surgical treatment algorithms. Modern imaging methods 
like 4D-flow MRI and pulse wave velocity have a potential to further improve 
individualized risk stratification in patients with genetic aortic syndromes.
KEY POINTS:   · The risk for cardiovascular complications such as acute aortic 
syndrome is increased in patients with genetic aortic syndromes.. · Recommended 
time intervals between image-based monitoring depend on the underlying aortic 
disease.. · CT-angiography should be used only in the acute setting.. · 
Non-contrast MR-angiography is adequate for screening and image-based monitoring 
of patients with genetic aortic syndromes..

Publisher: HINTERGRUND:  Genetische Aortenerkrankungen wie das Marfan- oder 
Loeys-Dietz-Syndrom umfassen ein relativ kleines, jedoch wichtiges 
kardiovaskuläres Patientenkollektiv. Die betroffenen Patienten unterscheiden 
sich durch diverse Phänotypen, haben jedoch alle bereits in jungem Alter ein 
sehr hohes Risiko für ein akutes Aortensyndrom. Sowohl in der Akutsituation als 
auch im Rahmen der Vorsorge ist die Schnittbildgebung unverzichtbar. In diesem 
Übersichtsartikel stellen wir die häufigsten genetischen Aortenerkrankungen und 
die für sie empfohlene Bildgebung vor. Darüber hinaus geben wir einen Ausblick 
auf moderne Methoden zur Erfassung der Hämodynamik bei Aortenerkrankungen.
METHODE:  Diese Übersichtsarbeit basiert auf der Kombination publizierter 
Expertenmeinungen sowie den klinischen Standards unseres auf Aortenerkrankungen 
spezialisierten Zentrums.
ERGEBNISSE UND SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN:  Die radiologische Bildgebung ist zentraler 
Bestandteil der initialen Diagnosestellung und Verlaufskontrolle genetischer 
Aortenerkrankungen und unterscheidet sich in Abhängigkeit der Grunderkrankung. 
Durch Kenntnis der Besonderheiten genetischer Aortenerkrankungen und der 
empfohlenen Bildgebungstechniken trägt der Radiologe wesentlich zur optimalen 
Patientenbetreuung bei. Die genaue Vermessung der Aortendiameter beeinflusst 
maßgeblich den interdisziplinären Beschluss eines prophylaktischen chirurgischen 
Aortenersatzes. Moderne Bildgebungstechniken wie die 4D-Fluss-MRT und die 
Pulswellengeschwindigkeit haben das Potenzial, die individualisierte 
Risikostratifizierung bei Patienten mit genetischen Aortenerkrankungen zu 
verbessern.
KERNAUSSAGEN:   · Patienten mit genetischen Aortenerkrankungen haben bereits in 
jungem Alter ein erhöhtes Risiko für vaskuläre Komplikationen wie das akute 
Aortensyndrom.. · Die Schnittbildgebung ist sowohl in der Akutsituation als auch 
im Rahmen der Vorsorge unverzichtbar.. · Die empfohlenen Zeitabstände und die 
Zielorgane für bildgebende Verlaufsuntersuchungen unterscheiden sich in 
Abhängigkeit von der Aggressivität der genetischen Aortenerkrankung.. · Die 
CT-Angiografie sollte nur in der Akutsituation oder in der präoperativen bzw. 
präinterventionellen Therapieplanung eingesetzt werden.. · Im Rahmen der 
Vorsorge empfiehlt sich die native MR-Angiografie der Aorta..

BACKGROUND: Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) often develop 
scoliosis that progresses rapidly after loss of ambulation. Management of 
scoliosis is crucial because it affects both life expectancy and quality of life 
of patients with DMD. Spinal orthosis attempts to prevent or delay scoliosis 
using spinal support at three points of the controlling mechanism; the curve 
should be flattened by the pressure. Therefore, it is assumed that spine 
flexibility could be a significant influencing factor for the effectiveness of 
braces. Hence, we attempted to investigate the flexibility of scoliosis in 
non-ambulant patients with DMD.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 273 boys who were genetically 
identified as having DMD, and finally, 50 boys with serial records of 
radiographs after loss of ambulation were finally enrolled. And among them, only 
31 patients developed scoliosis. Spine radiographs in sitting and supine 
positions were also reviewed to obtain Cobb angle, curve flexibility, and pelvic 
obliquity. Flexibilities (%) were calculated by the difference in angles between 
the sitting and supine positions divided by the angle at the sitting position, 
multiplied by 100.
RESULTS: Among 31 boys who had scoliosis, all but 2 boys with curves went 
through a sequential course of 1) no scoliosis, 2) nonstructural scoliosis, when 
scoliosis was only measurable in the sitting position, and 3) structural 
scoliosis, when scoliosis was also detectable in the supine position. 
Flexibility decreased each year after detection of scoliosis in those who 
developed scoliosis the first year, from 75.5 ± 5.0% to 57.1 ± 10.5% and to 
49.1 ± 10.0% (mean ± standard deviation). Spinal flexibility was significantly 
correlated with curve magnitude of scoliosis in both sitting and supine position 
(p < 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a period of fully reducible curve in DMD patients at the 
initial stage of scoliosis. Afterward, as spinal curve progresses, flexibility 
decreases over time. To detect the scoliosis when the curve is fully reducible, 
scoliosis curve in DMD patients should be evaluated dynamically, including
