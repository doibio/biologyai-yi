The relationship of mitochondrial DNA mutations to aging is still debated. Most 
mtDNA mutations are recessive: there are multiple copies per cell and mutation 
needs to clonally expand to cause respiratory deficiency. Overall mtDNA mutant 
loads are low, so effects of mutations are limited to critical areas where 
mutations locally reach high fractions. This includes respiratory chain 
deficient zones in muscle fibers, respiratory-deficient crypts in colon, and 
massive expansions of deleted mtDNA in substantia nigra neurons. mtDNA "mutator" 
mouse with increased rate of mtDNA mutations is a useful model, although rates 
and distribution of mutations may significantly deviate from what is observed in 
human aging. Comparison of species with different longevity reveals intriguing 
longevity-related traits in mtDNA sequence, although their significance is yet 
to be evaluated. The impact of somatic mtDNA mutations rapidly increases with 
age, so their importance is expected to grow as human life expectancy increases.

Bronchoanastomotic and bronchoplastic resections in pulmonary malignancy 
retrospective study 2000 - 2009.

Rus O, Motaş C, Motaş N, Achim D, Horvat T; -.

Bronchial resections are surgical procedures in which bronchial continuity is 
interrupted, followed by reconstruction of resected ends through terminal 
anastomosis or various forms of plastic procedures. The purpose of these 
interventions is to preserve functional lung parenchyma. These procedures are 
indicated in tumors with central location as an alternative to pneumonectomies, 
serving to preserve maximum functional lung parenchyma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We considered bronchoanastomotic and bronchoplastic 
procedures performed in our clinic over the period 2000-2009, for malignancy. 
There were 52 bronchoanastomotic resections and 9 bronchoplastic resections of 
which we analysed 40 bronchoanastomotic resections and 4 bronchoplastic 
resections (44 cases) ± associated resection. We excluded cases with 
non-malignant pathology or those with incomplete data at the beginning of the 
study.
RESULTS: The importance of the main factors involved in relation with survival 
was calculated. We considered the type of surgery performed, histological type, 
TNM stage, and characteristics of the study group (age, sex). We found 
statistically significant correlations between survival and histopathology of 
malignancy with a better survival for lung carcinoids, especially for typical 
carcinoid tumors. TNM stage did not significantly influence survival, but N2 
nodal involvement,according to the statistics, shows a poor prognosis. Age is 
another statistical significant factor correlated with post operative life 
expectancy, patients over 65 years old having a worse postoperative survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In the corresponding lung malignant pathology, bronchoanastomotic 
bronchoplastic resections are indicated,but one must take into account the 
patient's age before submission to surgery, the histopathologic type and N2 
nodal involvement.

OBJECTIVE: With subspecialty surgical care often unavailable to poor patients in 
developing countries, short-term brigades have filled a portion of the gap. We 
prospectively assessed the cost effectiveness of a pediatric neurosurgical 
brigade to Guatemala City, Guatemala.
METHODS: Data were collected on a weeklong annual pediatric neurosurgical 
brigade to Guatemala. Disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted were the 
metric of surgical effectiveness. Cost data included brigade expenses, as well 
as all costs incurred by the local health care system and patient families.
RESULTS: During the mission, 17 pediatric neurosurgical interventions were 
performed. Conditions these patients suffered would result in 382 total DALYs. 
Using conservative values of surgical effectiveness, procedures performed 
averted 138.1 DALYs. Although all operative and postoperative costs were covered 
by the visiting surgical team, patients spent an average of $226 in U.S. dollars 
for preoperative workup, travel, food/lodging, and lost wages (range, $36-$538). 
The local health care system absorbed a total cost of $12,910. Complete mission 
costs were $53,152, for a cost effectiveness of $385 per DALY averted.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating cost 
effectiveness of a short-term neurosurgical brigade. Although surgical 
intervention is acknowledged as playing a crucial role in global health, 
subspecialty surgical care is still broadly perceived as a luxury. Although 
providing care through local surgeons is undeniably more efficient than bringing 
in foreign medical teams, such care is not universally available. This study 
argues that volunteer neurosurgical teams can provide high complexity care with 
a competitive cost-effective profile.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine if the use of 
Active Therapeutic Movement Version 2 (ATM2) device and home exercises using the 
Mulligan's mobilization-with-movement concept by subjects with scoliosis would 
result in postural improvement and to document any changes in trunk range of 
motion and quality of life.
METHODS: Forty-three subjects between the ages of 12 to 75 years were recruited 
for the study. Each subject underwent a low back evaluation along with specific 
measurements for their scoliosis. Subjects participated in a 4-week 
intervention, 2 times a week consisting of treatment utilizing the ATM2 and were 
also given a home exercise program to mimic the specific movement(s) they 
performed on the ATM2. Photographic assessment of posture was taken before and 
after the intervention. Subjects were surveyed during the initial assessment and 
again at the final intervention using the following outcome measures: Fear 
Avoidance Belief Questionnaire, Short-Form Health Survey-36, Oswestry Disability 
Index, and a Numeric Pain Rating Scale.
RESULTS: Results were significant for most of the variables measured. Subjects 
gained improvement in spinal ranges of motion for all directions except for 
flexion and extension (most subjects had reference range of flexion and 
extension at the beginning of the study). Most subjects had improved pelvic 
alignment after the intervention. Before and after photographs demonstrated 
improved posture. Subjective measurements of pain, disability, and quality of 
life improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this preliminary study showed improvement for selected 
variables. The use of ATM2 and home exercises using the Mulligan's 
mobilization-with-movement concept by subjects with scoliosis appears to be a 
potentially viable conservative treatment alternative to address various 
findings associated with scoliosis, including posture improvement.

BACKGROUND: Non-invasive quantification of lower limb alignment using navigation 
technology is now possible throughout knee flexion owing to software 
developments. We report the precision and accuracy of a non-invasive system 
measuring mechanical alignment of the lower limb including coronal stress 
testing of the knee.
METHODS: Twelve cadaveric limbs were tested with a commercial invasive 
navigation system against the non-invasive system. Coronal mechanical 
femorotibial (MFT) alignment was measured with no stress, then 15 Nm varus and 
valgus applied moments. Measurements were recorded at 10° intervals from 
extension to 90° flexion. At each flexion interval, coefficient of repeatability 
(CR) tested precision within each system, and limits of agreement (LOA) tested 
agreement between the two systems. Limits for CR & LOA were set at 3° based on 
requirements for surgical planning and evaluation.
RESULTS: Precision was acceptable throughout flexion in all conditions of stress 
using the invasive system (CR ≤ 1.9°). Precision was acceptable using the 
non-invasive system from extension to 50° flexion (CR ≤ 2.4°), beyond which 
precision was unacceptable (> 3.4°). With no coronal stress applied, agreement 
remained acceptable from extension to 40° (LOA ≤ 2.4°), and when 15 Nm varus or 
valgus stress was applied agreement was acceptable from extension to 30° (LOA ≤ 
2.9°). Higher angles of knee flexion had a negative impact on precision and 
accuracy.
CONCLUSION & CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The non-invasive system provides reliable 
quantitative data in-vitro on coronal MFT alignment and laxity in the range 
relevant to assessment of collateral ligament injury, pre-operative planning of 
arthroplasty and flexion instability following arthroplasty. In-vivo validation 
should be performed.

The influence of smoking, sedentary lifestyle and obesity on cognitive 
impairment-free life expectancy.

Anstey KJ, Kingston A, Kiely KM, Luszcz MA, Mitchell P, Jagger C.

BACKGROUND: Smoking, sedentary lifestyle and obesity are risk factors for 
mortality and dementia. However, their impact on cognitive impairment-free life 
expectancy (CIFLE)has not previously been estimated.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the DYNOPTA dataset which was derived by 
harmonizing and pooling common measures from five longitudinal ageing studies. 
Participants for whom the Mini-Mental State Examination was available were 
included (N¼8111,48.6% men). Data on education, sex, body mass index, smoking 
and sedentary lifestyle were collected and mortality data were obtained from 
Government Records via data linkage.Total life expectancy (LE), CIFLE and years 
spent with cognitive impairment (CILE)were estimated for each risk factor and 
total burden of risk factors.
RESULTS: CILE was approximately 2 years for men and 3 years for women, 
regardless of age. For men and women respectively, reduced LE associated with 
smoking was 3.82and 5.88 years, associated with obesity was 0.62 and 1.72 years 
and associated with being sedentary was 2.50 and 2.89 years. Absence of each 
risk factor was associated with longer LE and CIFLE, but also longer CILE for 
smoking in women and being sedentary in both sexes. Compared with participants 
with no risk factors, those with 2þ had shorter CIFLE of up to 3.5 years 
depending on gender and education level.
CONCLUSIONS: Population level reductions in smoking, sedentary lifestyle and 
obesity increase longevity and number of years lived without cognitive 
impairment. Years lived with cognitive impairment may also increase.

The honeybee Apis mellifera has major ecological and economic importance. We 
analyze patterns of genetic variation at 8.3 million SNPs, identified by 
sequencing 140 honeybee genomes from a worldwide sample of 14 populations at a 
combined total depth of 634×. These data provide insight into the evolutionary 
history and genetic basis of local adaptation in this species. We find evidence 
that population sizes have fluctuated greatly, mirroring historical fluctuations 
in climate, although contemporary populations have high genetic diversity, 
indicating the absence of domestication bottlenecks. Levels of genetic variation 
are strongly shaped by natural selection and are highly correlated with patterns 
of gene expression and DNA methylation. We identify genomic signatures of local 
adaptation, which are enriched in genes expressed in workers and in immune 
system- and sperm motility-related genes that might underlie geographic 
variation in reproduction, dispersal and disease resistance. This study provides 
a framework for future investigations into responses to pathogens and climate 
change in honeybees.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal inherited autosomal recessive disease 
in Caucasians, affecting approximately one out of every 2,000 births. Survival 
of patients with cystic fibrosis has significantly improved due to advances in 
respiratory and nutritional care, and their current average life expectancy is 
30-40 years. Development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is a comorbidity 
that increases with age and may reach a prevalence up to 50% in adults. Its 
development is associated to impaired lung function and nutritional status, and 
early diagnosis and treatment are therefore essential to improve quality of life 
and performance status. Insulin therapy for diabetes and other early 
carbohydrate metabolism disorders may improve lung function and nutritional 
status of patients with cystic fibrosis.

PURPOSE: Tolvaptan is clinically effective in increasing serum sodium 
concentrations for patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. 
Appropriate treatment of hyponatremia may reduce the risk of death, hospital 
resource utilization, and economic burden. The aim of this study was to estimate 
the cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan treatment in patients who need to be 
hospitalized for treatment and monitoring of euvolemic or hypervolemic 
hyponatremia.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to assess the clinical and 
economic impact of tolvaptan compared with placebo during a 1-month treatment 
period. The probabilities, utility weights, resource utilization, and costs in 
the model were derived from clinical trials, survey research, and the Korean 
National Health Insurance database. Cost analysis was performed from the 
perspective of the South Korean health care setting in 2012 Korean won (KRW). 
The model outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed to identify the 
cost-effectiveness in case of tolvaptan treatment only for patients with marked 
hyponatremia. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed on key model parameters and assumptions.
FINDINGS: The total cost per patient was KRW 1,826,771 for tolvaptan treatment 
and KRW 2,281,926 for placebo. The quality-adjusted life-years for treatment 
with and without tolvaptan were 0.0481 and 0.0446, respectively. The base-case 
analysis revealed that tolvaptan was a more effective and less expensive 
strategy compared with placebo. In the subgroup analysis, this trend was more 
apparent in case of tolvaptan treatment only for patients with marked 
hyponatremia. The robustness of the results was confirmed by using deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
IMPLICATIONS: This cost-effectiveness analysis found that the use of tolvaptan 
was less expensive and more effective than treatment without tolvaptan in 
patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

PURPOSE: In the EASIE (Evaluation of Insulin Glargine Versus Sitagliptin in 
Insulin-Naïve Patients) trial, insulin glargine found a significant reduction in 
glycosylated hemoglobin compared with sitagliptin in patients with type 2 
diabetes who are inadequately controlled with metformin. The objective of this 
study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of insulin glargine compared with 
sitagliptin in type 2 diabetes patients, from the perspective of the publicly 
funded Canadian health care system.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model, a standard Markov structure and Monte 
Carlo simulation model, was used. The model used a lifetime horizon to capture 
the long-term complications associated with type 2 diabetes. The efficacy of 
insulin glargine and sitagliptin in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin reduction 
and corresponding rates of hypoglycemia were obtained from the EASIE trial. 
Health utility and cost data were obtained from recently published Canadian 
publications. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
FINDINGS: In the lifetime base-case analysis, treatment with insulin glargine 
resulted in cost savings of $1434 CAD in 2012 and a gain of 0.08 
quality-adjusted life years per patient. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
found the robustness of the base-case analysis, with 88% probability of insulin 
glargine being dominant (ie, cost savings and more quality-adjusted life years).
IMPLICATIONS: Insulin glargine is a clinically superior and cost-effective 
alternative to sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately 
controlled with metformin.

Controversies associated with the evaluation of elderly men with localized 
prostate cancer when considering radical prostatectomy.

The incidence of prostate cancer in Japan is increasing due to both the spread 
of screening and the rapid aging of the population. Most of this increase is 
expected to be attributable to the increase in the elderly male population. The 
management of various types of cancers in elderly patients is of growing 
interest, but several problems are encountered when evaluating elderly patients 
with localized prostate cancer, especially when radical prostatectomy (RP) is 
under consideration. First, life expectancy, health status, lifestyle, and 
available treatment modalities differ between regions, countries, and 
individuals, which potentially affects the choice of treatment options by both 
physicians and patients. Second, life expectancy is key when considering 
indications for RP. Many tools are available for predicting life expectancy, but 
their utilization varies greatly among physicians. Third, the malignant 
potential of latent or incidentally detected prostate cancer in Japanese men 
might be higher than those in other countries, and elderly men with prostate 
cancer are likely to have high-risk or locally advanced tumors, which may in 
turn support the more frequent use of radical treatments in elderly men. Fourth, 
patients treated with RP are likely to have fewer and less severe comorbidities 
than those treated with other treatments, which would complicate the comparison 
of outcomes. Fifth, the balance between survival benefits and adverse effects is 
an important influence on indications for RP. If robot-assisted laparoscopic RP 
can reduce the risk of adverse effects, indications for RP could be altered. 
Sixth, although several general health status screening tools such as the 
Geriatric 8 are available, no screening tools specialized for localized or 
Japanese prostate cancer patients exist. In conclusion, further study is needed 
to clarify the management of elderly Japanese patients with localized prostate 
cancer, because prostate cancer often requires different considerations to other 
types of cancer.

This two-year study is the first attempt to analyse the ecological effects of 
breakwater systems on soft-bottom assemblages along the North Tyrrhenian coast. 
Differently from previous studies focusing on infauna of on-shore and off-shore 
sides, we compared the assemblages inhabiting the surrounding soft-bottoms not 
directly protected by the breakwaters, defining our sampling stations at varying 
distances from the breakwaters and at constant distance from the coast. Data 
collected revealed that abundance, species richness and M-AMBI ecological 
quality differed between northern and southern sides, and were related to 
distance from structures. Multivariate analyses of relationships between 
assemblages and abiotic characteristics support this hypothesis. The extension 
of these effects, that resulted to be weak and limited to a restricted area, 
could be a consequence of coastal current on local hydrodynamics. This study 
provides novel and critical information for the management of the coastal 
defence infrastructure spreading along the western coast of Italy.

Cystic fibrosis is characterised by chronic polymicrobial infection and 
inflammation in the airways of patients. Antibiotic treatment regimens, 
targeting recognised pathogens, have substantially contributed to increased life 
expectancy of patients with this disease. Although the emergence of 
antimicrobial resistance and selection of highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial 
strains is of major concern, the clinical relevance in cystic fibrosis is yet to 
be defined. Resistance has been identified in recognised cystic fibrosis 
pathogens and in other bacteria (eg, Prevotella and Streptococcus spp) detected 
in the airway microbiota, but their role in the pathophysiology of infection and 
inflammation in chronic lung disease is unclear. Increased antibiotic resistance 
in cystic fibrosis might be attributed to a range of complex factors including 
horizontal gene transfer, hypoxia, and biofilm formation. Strategies to manage 
antimicrobial resistance consist of new antibiotics or localised delivery of 
antimicrobial agents, iron sequestration, inhibition of quorum-sensing, and 
resistome analysis. Determination of the contributions of every bacterial 
species to lung health or disease in cystic fibrosis might also have an 
important role in the management of antibiotic resistance.

Disruption of the growth hormone (GH) axis promotes longevity and delays aging. 
In contrast, GH over-expression may lead to accelerated aging and shorter life. 
Calorie restriction (CR) improves insulin sensitivity and may extend lifespan. 
Long-lived Ames dwarf (df/df) mice have additional extension of longevity when 
subjected to 30% CR. The aim of the study was to assess effects of CR or GH 
replacement therapy separately and as a combined (CR+GH) treatment in 
GH-deficient df/df and normal mice, on selected metabolic parameters (e.g., 
insulin, glucose, cholesterol), insulin signaling components (e.g., insulin 
receptor [IR] β-subunit, phosphorylated form of IR [IR pY1158], protein kinase C 
ζ/λ [p-PKCζ/λ] and mTOR [p-mTOR]), transcription factor p-CREB, and components 
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (p-ERK1/2, p-p38), 
responsible for cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. CR decreased 
plasma levels of insulin, glucose, cholesterol and leptin, and increased hepatic 
IR β-subunit and IR pY1158 levels as well as IR, IRS-1 and GLUT-2 gene 
expression compared to ad libitum feeding, showing a significant beneficial diet 
intervention effect. Moreover, hepatic protein levels of p-PKCζ/λ, p-mTOR and 
p-p38 decreased, and p-CREB increased in CR mice. On the contrary, GH increased 
levels of glucose, cholesterol and leptin in plasma, and p-mTOR or p-p38 in 
livers, and decreased plasma adiponectin and hepatic IR β-subunit compared to 
saline treatment. There were no GH effects on adiponectin in N mice. Moreover, 
GH replacement therapy did not affect IR, IRS-1 and GLUT-2 gene expression. GH 
treatment abolishes the beneficial effects of CR; it may suggest an important 
role of GH-IGF1 axis in mediating the CR action. Suppressed somatotrophic 
signaling seems to predominate over GH replacement therapy in the context of the 
examined parameters and signaling pathways.

Cost-effectiveness of a randomized trial to treat depression among Latinos.

Alliance-Harvard Medical School. 120 Beacon Street, 4th floor, Somerville, MA

BACKGROUND: Rising mental health costs have brought with them the pressing need 
to identify cost-effective treatments. Identifying cost-effective treatments for 
depression among Latinos is particularly relevant given substantial disparities 
in access to depression treatment for Latinos compared to non-Latino whites.
AIMS: The goal of this paper is to (i) compare the cost-effectiveness of 
telephone and face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression to 
usual care received in primary care; (ii) compare the cost-effectiveness of 
telephone CBT directly to face-to-face CBT.
METHODS: As part of a randomized trial study, primary care patients with 
depression were randomized into three groups: usual care, telephone CBT and 
face-to-face CBT. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) between 
respective groups are computed by dividing the incremental difference in mental 
health care costs by the incremental difference in mental health outcomes. 
Mental health care costs are computed as the sum of intervention costs (cost of 
administering sessions) and non-intervention costs (cost of mental health 
services used that are not part of the intervention). Prices for different types 
of mental health services are taken from the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey. Mental health costs are estimated using two-part models. Mental health 
outcomes are measured by two depression scales: Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ-9) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), and are estimated using multiple 
linear regression models. The standard errors for ICERs are computed using 1000 
bootstrapped samples and the delta method.
RESULTS: Each CBT intervention group is significantly more costly compared to 
usual care in terms of mental health care costs. Face-to-face CBT patients cost 
USD732 more than usual care, and phone CBT patients cost USD237 more than usual 
care. In terms of effectiveness, both intervention groups are associated with 
significantly reduced (improved) scores in PHQ9 and HSCL compared to usual care. 
Comparing the phone therapy directly to the same treatment offered face-to-face, 
we find that phone CBT is significantly less costly (by USD501) and more 
cost-effective than face-to-face when effectiveness is measured by improvement 
in PHQ9 scores. Specifically, for the phone CBT group, one score reduction in 
PHQ9 costs USD634 less than face-to-face.
DISCUSSION: One limitation is that we observe the mental health service use of 
patients for only four months. Phone CBT might potentially lead to substantial 
savings or even cost-offset in the long-run. Additional studies with long-run 
service use data are needed to establish these findings.
IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH POLICY: The finding that phone-based intervention is able 
to improve the depressive symptoms of patients just as effectively as 
face-to-face by spending less is crucial for policy makers and health 
institutions looking to adopt cost-effective depression treatments.

Hormone-brain-aging relationships, broadly reactive with imidazole-containing 
dipeptides: targeting of telomere attrition as an aging biomarker and dynamic 
telomerase activity flirting.

Babizhayev MA, Vishnyakova KS, Yegorov YE.

It has been documented that telomere-associated cellular senescence may 
contribute to certain age-related disorders, and telomere length (TL) may be an 
informative biomarker of healthy aging. Hormone-brain-aging behavior-modulated 
telomere dynamics and changes in telomerase activity are consistent elements of 
cellular alterations associated with changes in proliferative state, and these 
processes are consequently considered as the new therapeutic drug targets for 
physiological control with advanced drug delivery and nutritional formulations. 
We raise and support a therapeutic concept of using nonhydrolyzed forms of 
naturally occurring neuron-specific imidazole dipeptide-based compounds 
carnosine and carcinine, making it clinically possible that slowing down the 
rate of telomere shortening could slow down the human aging process in specific 
tissues where proliferative senescence is known to occur, with the demonstrated 
evidence of telomere shortening that appeared to be a hallmark of oxidative 
stress and disease. Carnosine released from skeletal muscle during exercise may 
be transported into the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) histamine 
neurons and hydrolyzed. The resulting L-histidine may subsequently be converted 
into histamine, which could be responsible for the effects of carnosine on 
neurotransmission and hormone-like antiaging physiological function. The 
preliminary longitudinal studies of elderly individuals suggest that longer 
telomeres are associated with better survival, and an advanced oral nutritional 
support with nonhydrolyzed carnosine (or carcinine and patented compositions 
thereof) is a useful therapeutic tool for a critical TL maintenance that may 
fundamentally be applied in the treatment of age-related sight-threatening eye 
disorders, prolonged life expectancy, increased survival and chronological age 
of an organism in health control, smoking behavior, and disease. "Our pleasures 
were simple-they included survival." -Dwight D. Eisenhower, 34th President of 
the United States, 1953-1961.

[Article in Croatian]

Merkler M, Pećin I, Simić I, Muacević-Katanec D, Sućur N, Reiner Z.

Early diagnosis and management of patients with Fabry disease (FD) requires a 
multidisciplinary approach of several different experts. The aim of this 
document is to provide health care professionals with guidelines for management 
of adult patients with Fabry disease. These guidelines were produced by the 
staff of the Division of Metabolic Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, 
University Hospital Center Zagreb, which is the Referral Expert Center for Rare 
and Metabolic Diseases of the Ministry of Health, Republic of Croatia. The first 
guidelines ever published in Croatia concerning a rare metabolic disease are 
presented. This document provides a short summary on Fabry disease, how to 
diagnose Fabry disease, management of patients with this disease, follow-up of 
the patients, and gives recommendations on therapy and genetic testing.

The wobbly status of ketolides: where do we stand?

Ketolides are erythromycin A derivatives with a keto group replacing the 
cladinose sugar and an aryl-alkyl group attached to the lactone macrocycle. The 
aryl-alkyl extension broadens its antibacterial spectrum to include all 
pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): Streptococcus 
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis as well as atypical 
pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila). 
Ketolides have extensive tissue distribution, favorable pharmacokinetics (oral, 
once-a-day) and useful anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory properties. Hence, 
they were considered attractive additions to established oral antibacterials 
(quinolones, β-lactams, second-generation macrolides) for mild-to-moderate CAP. 
The first ketolide to be approved, Sanofi-Aventis' telithromycin (RU 66647, HMR 
3647, Ketek®), had tainted clinical development, controversial FDA approval and 
subsequent restrictions due to rare, irreversible hepatotoxicity that included 
deaths. Three additional ketolides progressed to non-inferiority clinical trials 
vis-à-vis clarithromycin for CAP. Abbott's cethromycin (ABT-773), acquired by 
Polymedix and subsequently by Advanced Life Sciences, completed Phase III 
trials, but its New Drug Application was denied by the FDA in 2009. Enanta's 
modithromycin (EDP-420), originally codeveloped with Shionogi (S-013420) and 
subsequently by Shionogi alone, is currently in Phase II in Japan. Optimer's 
solithromycin (OP-1068), acquired by Cempra (CEM-101), is currently in Phase 
III. Until this hepatotoxicity issue is resolved, ketolides are unlikely to 
replace established antibacterials for CAP, or lipoglycopeptides and 
oxazolidinones for gram-positive infections.

BACKGROUND: Prior economic analysis that compared the 12-gene assay to published 
patterns of care predicted the assay would improve outcomes while lowering 
medical costs for stage II, T3, mismatch-repair-proficient (MMR-P) colon cancer 
patients. This study assessed the validity of those findings with real-world 
adjuvant chemotherapy (aCT) recommendations from the US third-party payer 
perspective.
METHODS: Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for stage 
II, T3, MMR-P colon cancer patients using guideline-compliant, state-transition 
probability estimation methods in a Markov model. A study of 141 patients from 
17 sites in the Mayo Clinic Cancer Research Consortium provided aCT 
recommendations before and after knowledge of the 12-gene assay results. 
Progression and adverse events data with aCT regimens were based on published 
literature. Drug and administration costs for aCT were obtained from 2014 
Medicare Fee Schedule. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the drivers and robustness 
of the primary outcomes.
RESULTS: After receiving the 12-gene assay results, physician recommendations in 
favor of aCT decreased 22 %; fluoropyrimidine monotherapy and FOLFOX 
recommendations each declined 11 %. Average per-patient drugs, administration, 
and adverse events costs decreased $US2,339, $US733, and $US3,211, respectively. 
Average total direct medical costs decreased $US991. Average patient well-being 
improved by 0.114 QALYs. Savings are expected to persist even if the cost of 
oxaliplatin drops by >75 % due to generic substitution.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that real-world changes in aCT 
recommendations due to the 12-gene assay are likely to reduce direct medical 
costs and improve well-being for stage II, T3, MMR-P colon cancer patients.

Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney 
transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients renal 
transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality of life in 
comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal transplantation in 
recipients older than 65years are inferior to those observed in younger adults, 
death with functioning graft representing a major cause of failure. Therefore, 
the selection of aged patients is of paramount importance. Apart from the 
routine clinical and biological investigations, three aspects have been 
relatively neglected by the transplant community and may require a careful 
analysis in elderly candidates to transplantation: the presence and degree of 
frailty, the presence of comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. 
Although there are rapid and simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in 
the elderly, there is no clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient should 
be accepted or not. With advanced age the prevalence and severity of 
cardiovascular events and other diseases tend to increase. The use of combined 
age-comorbidity indices may be helpful to identify patients at high risk of 
mortality. Another critical point is the poor unintentional adherence to 
treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and mild cognitive impairment. These 
drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high number of pills to take and by 
changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A careful screening of the 
presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and poor compliance to treatment is 
highly recommended before admitting older candidates to the waiting list for 
transplantation.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The prognostic value of myocardium deformation 
measurements in chronic heart failure (CHF) is still poorly addressed. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation of left ventricular (LV) 
global longitudinal strain (GLS) with clinical and prognostic indicators in 
patients with CHF and systolic dysfunction.
METHODS: Ambulatory patients with CHF and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% were 
studied by two-dimensional and Doppler transthoracic echocardiogram with 
assessment of GLS. An indication of prognostic status was obtained by the 
Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) prognostic estimates for life expectancy.
RESULTS: We included 54 CHF patients (mean age 55±12 years; 80% male). GLS was 
significantly correlated with NYHA functional class (r=0.41, p=0.002), BNP 
levels (r=0.47, p=0.001), LVEF (r=-0.69, p<0.001) and LV end-diastolic pressure, 
assessed by E/e' ratio (r=0.35, p<0.014) and left atrial maximal volume index 
(r=0.57, p<0.001). A significant correlation was found between GLS and SHFM 
prognostic estimates for life expectancy (r=-0.41, p=0.002). The multivariate 
logistic regression analysis showed that GLS independently predicted an 
estimated life expectancy <10 years (OR 2.614 [95% CI 1.010-6.763]). The 
corresponding area under the ROC curve was 0.802 (0.653-0.951) and the best 
obtained threshold was -9.5 (80% sensitivity, 65% specificity, p=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: GLS was strongly associated with a higher disease severity status 
and predicted a lower prognostic estimate for life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: The safety and efficacy of adalimumab for patients with moderately 
to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) has been reported up to week 52 from 
the placebo-controlled trials ULTRA (Ulcerative Colitis Long-Term Remission and 
Maintenance with Adalimumab) 1 and 2. Up to 4 years of data for 
adalimumab-treated patients from ULTRA 1, 2, and the open-label extension ULTRA 
3 are presented.
METHODS: Remission per partial Mayo score, remission per Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score, and mucosal healing rates were assessed in 
adalimumab-randomized patients from ULTRA 1 and 2 up to week 208. 
Corticosteroid-free remission was assessed in adalimumab-randomized patients who 
used corticosteroids at lead-in study baseline. Maintenance of remission per 
partial Mayo score and mucosal healing was assessed in patients who entered 
ULTRA 3 in remission per full Mayo score and with mucosal healing, respectively. 
As observed, last observation carried forward (LOCF) and nonresponder imputation 
(NRI) were used to report efficacy. Adverse events were reported for any 
adalimumab-treated patient.
RESULTS: A total of 600/1,094 patients enrolled in ULTRA 1 or 2 were randomized 
to receive adalimumab and included in the intent-to-treat analyses of the 
studies. Of these, 199 patients remained on adalimumab after 4 years of 
follow-up. Rates of remission per partial Mayo score, remission per IBDQ score, 
mucosal healing, and corticosteroid discontinuation at week 208 were 24.7%, 
26.3%, 27.7% (NRI), and 59.2% (observed), respectively. Of the patients who were 
followed up in ULTRA 3 (588/1,094), a total of 360 patients remained on 
adalimumab 3 years later. Remission per partial Mayo score and mucosal healing 
after ULTRA 1 or 2 to year 3 of ULTRA 3 were maintained by 63.6% and 59.9% of 
patients, respectively (NRI). Adverse event rates were stable over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Remission, mucosal healing, and improved quality of life were 
maintained in patients with moderately to severely active UC with long-term 
adalimumab therapy, for up to 4 years. No new safety signals were reported.

Disease burdens from environmental tobacco smoke in Korean adults.

Heo S(1), Lee JT.

Author information:
(1)a Department of Public Health Science , Graduate School, Korea University , 
Seoul , Republic of Korea.

In this study, we estimated the disease burdens attributable to environmental 
tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in Korean adults in 2010 and analyzed the trend of 
that from 2005 to 2010. We obtained information on the study population from the 
2010 Cause of Death Statistic and estimated the ETS-attributable fraction using 
data from the Korean Community Health Survey and the Korean National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey. The numbers of ETS-attributable deaths in female 
and male non-smokers were estimated to be 4.1 and 69.6% of the numbers of deaths 
attributable to current smoke, respectively. The deaths attributable to ETS were 
larger in female than in male non-smokers (710 vs. 420). The ETS-attributable 
deaths increased slightly in 2005-2008 but decreased in 2009-2010. The number of 
potential years of life lost from ETS was 9077.24 years in 2010. If there were 
no exposure to ETS in adult non-smokers, we would expect to see 1130 fewer 
deaths (9.9% of the deaths from current smoke). The results suggest that ETS 
poses considerable disease burdens for non-smokers, especially women, in Korea.

Author information:
(1)St Mark's Hospital and Academic Institute, Harrow, Middlesex, UK.

AIM: This systematic review aimed to assess the use of patient preference in 
colorectal cancer treatment. Eliciting patient preference is important for 
shared decision-making in colorectal cancer treatment. The introduction of newer 
treatments, which balance quality of life and overall survival, makes this an 
important future focus.
METHOD: A systematic search strategy of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and 
the Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews was undertaken to obtain relevant 
articles. Information regarding the type of patients included, preference 
instruments, study settings, outcomes and limitations was extracted.
RESULTS: The eight articles comprising this review each described an empirical
