BACKGROUND: With the change of life and work style, more middle-aged and elderly 
individuals are suffering from neck pain. In China, traditional Chinese 
exercises (TCEs) are widely used in the management of neck pain, such as Tai 
Chi, Qigong, Yijinjing, Baduanjin, Liuzijue, and Five-animal exercises. However, 
the evidence of TCEs for neck pain maintains controversial. Therefore, the 
current systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effects of TCEs on pain 
and disability of middle-aged and elderly patients with neck pain.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in six electronic 
databases from their inception to January 2022 for randomized controlled trials 
of TCEs for neck pain. The methodological quality of the included studies was 
assessed by PEDro scale. The subgroup analysis was conducted based on different 
TCEs. The I 2 statistic was applied to assess the heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in our review, which were conducted in 
China, United States, and Germany between 2003 and 2021. Most (86%) of them 
exceeded the cut off score 6. TCEs included Baduanjin, Yijinjing, Tai Chi, 
Qigong, and Five-animal exercises. The aggregated results indicated that TCEs 
showed positive complementary effects in relieving pain (SMD, 1.12; 95% CI, 
0.78-1.45; p < 0.00001), especially Baduanjin exercises. Baduanjin exercises 
also showed beneficial complementary effects in improving flexion (SMD, 0.65; 
95% CI, 0.28-1.03; p = 0.0006) and extension (SMD, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.12-1.19; p = 
0.02) of the neck. In addition, the aggregated results indicated that TCEs alone 
showed beneficial effects in improving disability (SMD, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.40-1.08; 
p < 0.0001) and relieving pain (SMD, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.50-1.13; p < 0.00001) 
compared with waiting list. The follow-up effects of TCEs were still 
insufficient.
CONCLUSION: There was the positive evidence to support the clinical use of TCEs, 
as a complementary therapy, for middle-aged and elderly patients with neck pain, 
especially Baduanjin exercises. However, the evidence supporting the effects of 
TCEs alone for the middle-aged and elderly patients with neck pain was limited 
due to the small sample size.

In context of the climate change, major abiotic stresses faced by plants include 
salt stress and drought stress. Though, plants have similar physiological 
mechanisms to cope with these salt and drought stresses. The physiological and 
biochemical response of native plants to the combined application of salinity 
and drought stresses are still not well-understood. Thus, to investigate the 
combined effect of salinity and drought stresses, an experiment was conducted on 
Salsola imbricata with four levels of salinity and four drought intensities 
under the arid climatic conditions. The experiment was conducted in a randomized 
complete block design with a split-plot arrangement replicated three times. S. 
imbricata had been found resistant to different levels of individual and 
combined salt and drought stresses. S. imbricata survived till the end of the 
experiment. Salt and water stress did not show any significant effects on shoot 
weight, shoot length, and root length. The drought stress affected the 
photosynthetic rate, ion uptake and leaf water potential. However, salt stress 
helped to counter this effect of drought stress. Thus, drought stress did not 
affect plant growth, photosynthesis rate, and ion uptake when combined with salt 
stress. Increased Na+ and Cl- uptake under the salt stress helped in osmotic 
adjustment. Therefore, the leaf water potential (LWP) decreased with increasing 
the salt stress from 5 dSm-1 until 15 dSm-1 and increased again at 20 dSm-1. At 
lower salt stress, ABA and proline content declined with increasing the drought 
stress. However, at higher salt stress, ABA content increased with increasing 
the drought stress. In conclusion, the salt stress had been found to have a 
protective role to drought stress for S. imbricata. S. imbricata utilized 
inorganic ion for osmotic adjustment at lower salinity stress but also 
accumulate the organic solutes to balance the osmotic pressure of the ions in 
the vacuole under combined stress conditions. Due to the physical lush green 
appearance and less maintenance requirements, S. imbricata can be recommended as 
a native substitute in landscaping under the salt and drought stresses 
conditions.

Poststroke and traumatic elbow injuries are the most common cause of elbow 
stiffness, which results in loss of functional range of motion (ROM). Various 
studies support early mobilization of the elbow joint after injury or after 
surgery to reduce risks of elbow stiffness development. After hospitalization, 
patients are required to follow a long-term rehabilitation program during home 
recovery. Still, most patients do not adhere to their clinical therapy schedule 
due to either rehabilitation cost, social obligations, negligence, or lack of 
inspiration. Moreover, the numbers of therapists and assessment equipment are 
insufficient. This study introduces a smart elbow brace (SEB) as a home-based 
rehabilitation device that reduces regular in-patient rehabilitation costs and 
therapist workload and motivates patients to comply with the rehabilitation 
program that enhances the achievement of rehabilitation goals. Our device has 
two active degrees of freedom (2-DoF) that allow extension, flexion, pronation, 
and supination elbow motions. An extra sliding joint between forearm and wrist 
is added, which helps dump forces concentration at the elbow joint during 
extension-flexion movement. Mechanical design requirements, motion-tracking 
systems, and serious game development are described. The feasibility of a 
proposed SEB device is tested with five healthy subjects playing developed 
serious games with the device. The results show that subjects can attain maximum 
and minimum angles of flexion-extension and pronation-supination motion designed 
for elbow stiffness rehabilitation. The SEB device will be beneficial and be 
used at home as a complementary tool to support elbow stiffness rehabilitation 
during long-term home recovery.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review examining the effect of exercise and 
rehabilitation in people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).
DATA SOURCES: The following databases were systematically searched: MEDLINE, 
MEDLINE In-Process/ePubs, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health. The final 
time point captured by the search is November 27, 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: Eligible study designs included case-control, case-series, 
prospective cohort, retrospective cohort, and intervention studies of structured 
exercise or rehabilitation interventions. Eligible populations included adults 
(18 years or older) with EDS (all subtypes) and hypermobility spectrum 
disorders. The search was restricted to articles published in English.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Risk of bias 
was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale for 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies of 
Interventions (ROBINS-I) for non-RCTs. Reporting quality of RCTs was assessed 
using the Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials statement with the 
harms extension. Reporting was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The search yielded 10 eligible studies including 330 
participants. The study designs included 5 RCTs, 1 cohort, 2 single-arm 
interventions, 1 retrospective, and 1 feasibility study. All studies showed some 
improvement in a physical and/or psychological outcome after the intervention 
period. One adverse event (nonserious) potentially related to the intervention 
was reported. Of the 5 RCTs, 2 were rated as high quality with low risk of bias 
using PEDro, and the majority of non-RCTs were rated as critical risk of bias by 
ROBINS-I.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that exercise and rehabilitation may be 
beneficial for various physical and psychological outcomes. Adequately powered 
and rigorous RCTs of exercise and rehabilitation interventions for people with 
EDS are needed.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM), which 
significantly increases the risk of mortality, is increasing globally. However, 
the role of healthy lifestyle in the secondary prevention of CMM is unclear.
METHODS: In total, 290,795 participants with CMM, which was defined as 
coexistence of at least two of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), 
coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke (ST), and those without these four 
diseases at baseline were derived from UK Biobank. The associations between 
specific CMM patterns and mortality, and that between healthy lifestyle 
(including physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and vegetable and 
fruit consumption) and mortality in patients with specific CMM patterns were 
calculated using the flexible parametric Royston-Parmar proportion-hazard model. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated.
RESULTS: During a median 12.3-year follow up period, 15,537 (5.3%) deaths 
occurred. Compared with participants without cardiometabolic diseases, the HRs 
for all-cause mortality were 1.54 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30, 1.82] in 
participants with HTN + DM, 1.84 (95% CI: 1.59, 2.12) in those with HTN + CHD, 
1.89 (95% CI: 1.46, 2.45) in those with HTN + ST, and 2.89 (95% CI: 2.28, 3.67) 
in those with HTN + DM + CHD. At the age of 45 years, non-current smoking was 
associated with an increase in life expectancy by 3.72, 6.95, 6.75, and 4.86 
years for participants with HTN + DM, HTN + CHD, HTN + ST, and HTN + DM + CHD, 
respectively. A corresponding increase by 2.03, 1.95, 2.99, and 1.88 years, 
respectively, was observed in participants with regular physical activity. 
Non-/moderate alcohol consumption and adequate fruit/vegetable consumption were 
not significantly associated with life expectancy in patients with specific CMM 
patterns.
CONCLUSION: Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was associated with an increased risk 
of mortality. Regular physical activity and non-current smoking can increase 
life expectancy in patients with specific CMM patterns.

In China, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was accounted for a 
quarter of the global COPD population and has become a large economic burden. 
However, the comprehensive picture of the COPD burden, which could inform health 
policy, is not readily available for all of the provinces of China. Here, we 
aimed to describe the burden of COPD in China, providing an up-to-date and 
comprehensive analysis at the national and provincial levels, and time trends 
from 1990 to 2019. Following the methodology framework and general analytical 
strategies used in the GBD 2019, we analyzed the incidence, prevalence, 
mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability 
(YLDs), and years with life lost (YLLs) attributable to COPD across China and 
the corresponding time trends from 1990 to 2019, stratified by age and province. 
In order to quantify the secular trends of the burden of COPD, the estimated 
annual percentage changes were calculated by the linear regression model of 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) and calendar years. We also presented the 
contribution of risk factors to COPD-related mortality and DALYs. The 
association between COPD burden and socio-demographic index (SDI) were also 
evaluated. From 1990 to 2019, the incidence and prevalence numbers of COPD 
increased by 61.2 and 67.8%, respectively, whereas the number of deaths and 
DALYs owing to COPD decreased. The ASRs of COPD burden, including incidence, 
prevalence, mortality, DALYs, YLDs, and YLLs continuously decreased from 1990 to 
2019. The crude rates of COPD burden dramatically increased with age and reached 
a peak in the older than 95 years age group. In 2019, the leading risk factor 
for COPD mortality and DALYs was tobacco use in the whole population, but 
ambient particulate matter pollution was the most significant risk factor in 
females. At the provincial level, the ASRs of COPD burden was significantly 
associated with the SDIs, with the highest ASRs in the western provinces with 
low SDIs. Collectively, our study indicated that COPD remains an important 
public health problem in China. Geographically targeted considerations should be 
developed to enhance COPD health and reduce the COPD burden throughout China and 
in specific provinces.

Currently, edible films have been increasingly explored to solve muscle food 
spoilage during storage, especially through the incorporation of plant extracts 
to develop edible packaging materials. Natural polymers matrices with plant 
extracts are befitting for fabricating edible films by casting methods. In the 
films system, the structure and physicochemical properties were strengthened via 
chemical interactions between active molecules in plant extracts and the 
reactive groups in the polymer chain. The antibacterial and antioxidant 
properties were dramatically reinforced through both physical and chemical 
actions of the plant extracts. Additionally, edible films imbedded with 
color-rich plant extracts could be considered as potential sensitive indicators 
to monitor the spoilage degree of muscle foods in response to change in gas or 
temperature. Furthermore, these films could increase sensory acceptability, 
improve quality and prolong the shelf life of muscle foods. In this article, the 
types, preparation methods and reinforcing properties of the edible films with 
plant extracts were discussed. Also, the applications of these films were 
summarized on quality maintenance and shelf-life extension and intelligent 
monitoring in muscle foods. Finally, a novel technology for film preparation 
achieving high-stability and sustained release of active compounds will become 
an underlying trend for application in muscle food packaging.

The haem enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) catalyses the rate-limiting 
step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism and plays an essential 
role in immunity, neuronal function, and ageing. Expression of IDO1 in cancer 
cells results in the suppression of an immune response, and therefore IDO1 
inhibitors have been developed for use in anti-cancer immunotherapy. Here, we 
report an extension of our previously described highly efficient haem-binding 
1,2,3-triazole and 1,2,4-triazole inhibitor series, the best compound having 
both enzymatic and cellular IC50 values of 34 nM. We provide enzymatic 
inhibition data for almost 100 new compounds and X-ray diffraction data for one 
compound in complex with IDO1. Structural and computational studies explain the 
dramatic drop in activity upon extension to pocket B, which has been observed in 
diverse haem-binding inhibitor scaffolds. Our data provides important insights 
for future IDO1 inhibitor design.

Down Syndrome: A Review of Key Perioperative Implications.

Hines CB, Simmons SA.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in humans that is 
compatible with life. This syndrome occurs when there is an extra copy of the 
21st chromosome. Down syndrome is associated with numerous comorbidities that 
can pose challenges for the perioperative nurse caring for a patient with DS 
undergoing surgery. These challenges can affect the patient assessment, 
communication with the patient, and patient safety (eg, preventing 
complications). As the life expectancy of people with DS has increased, so too 
have the chances that perioperative nurses will care for a patient with this 
disorder. This article reviews the pathophysiology of DS, discusses common 
comorbidities that may directly affect perioperative care, and reviews an 
exemplar case study that demonstrates how personnel with knowledge of DS can 
positively influence surgical team decision making for these patients in the 
perioperative setting.

Clinical case of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy manifested with lactic acidosis 
and stroke-like episodes was presented. The patient diagnosis was performed in 
childhood, based on clinical manifestation, and was confirmed with molecular 
genetic test (mutation m.3243A>G in gene MT-TL1 was revealed). Appropriate 
patient management required united efforts of different medical specialists with 
simultaneous administration of different drugs, modulating intracellular energy 
production. Due to contemporary medical science achievements, life expectancy of 
patients with mitochondrial diseases increases, and in age 18 such patients 
should be treated by adult-practice physicians. Due to such pathology rare 
incidence the adult-practice medical practitioners are insufficiently informed 
about principles of mitochondrial disease treatment, that has negative influence 
on patients condition.

современной науки продолжительность жизни больных с митохондриальными 
заболеваниями увеличилась, по достижении 18 лет они переходят к неврологам, 
работающим со взрослыми пациентами. В связи с редкой встречаемостью заболевания 
у взрослых осведомленность о принципах ведения таких больных недостаточная, что 
негативным образом сказывается на состоянии пациентов.

In February 2022, rust-like lesions were observed on commercial sugarcane 
cultivar N76 in the North Coast area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa 
(29°23'45.95"S; 31°10'3.91"E). Moderate to severe leaf symptoms were present 
throughout the 0.2 ha field that was planted in August 2021. The symptoms 
differed from those of the two sugarcane rusts commonly observed in South 
Africa, namely, brown rust (Puccinia melanocephala H. & P. Sydow) and tawny rust 
(Macruropyxis fulva L.A. Martin, S.A. McFarl. and L.A. Castl.) (Martin et al., 
2017). Similar symptoms were subsequently observed on several additional 
cultivars in other regions of the industry. Up to five leaves were collected 
from each contaminated field and examined under a dissecting microscope. 
Uredinial lesions were orange-brown, cinnamon-brown to red-brown in colour and 
were 0.5 to 5 × 0.2 to 0.5 mm. Uredinia within the lesions were 300 to 820 × 28 
to 40 μm, mainly hypophyllous although epiphyllous uredinia were occasionally 
observed on severely infected leaves. Uredinia were ellipsoid to fusiform in 
shape. Urediniospores were transferred to microscope slides and examined at 400x 
magnification. The urediniospores were morphologically similar to Puccinia 
kuehnii E. J. Butler, causal agent of sugarcane orange rust (Glynn et al., 
2010). They were orange to cinnamon-brown in colour, mostly obovoid to pyriform 
in shape and moderately echinulate. They were variable in size (25 to 55 × 22 to 
27 μm), most with obvious apical thickening of up to 10 μm. Inconspicuous 
paraphyses were occasionally present but no telia or teliospores were observed. 
Identity of the pathogen was confirmed using primers Pk2-F and Pk1-R, targeting 
the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) region (Glynn et al., 2010). 
The 384-bp sequence (GenBank Accession no: ON329808) matched 100% with P. 
kuehnii submissions on Genbank and was distinct from those of P. melanocephala 
and M. fulva. Rust symptoms observed on cultivar Co301 in South Africa from 1941 
were previously reported to be caused by P. kuehnii (Gorter, 1977; Crous et al., 
2000). However, the pathogen was later correctly identified as P. melanocephala 
(Bailey, 1979). This is therefore the first report of P. kuehnii infecting 
sugarcane in South Africa, after being detected periodically on a spore trap 
located in Komatipoort, Mpumalanga (25°33'2.83"S 31°57'22.19"E) since 2016. An 
Emergency Response Plan, developed in anticipation of an orange rust incursion 
in South Africa, guided the initial response of the industry. This included the 
application of a fungicide (a.i. azoxystrobin / cyproconazole) pre-emptively 
registered for orange rust on sugarcane in South Africa in infected fields, 
notification of key contacts in southern Africa, and industry-wide surveys to 
determine prevalence and provide an indication of varietal susceptibility. Long 
term management will include screening for varietal resistance and the 
registration of additional fungicides against the disease. Research on the 
conditions favouring infection will allow the inclusion of orange rust in the 
local sugarcane rust forecasting model, while trials to assess the effect on 
yield will provide an indication of the impact of the disease on production.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) differences within and between states by 
race/ethnicity have not been examined.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate LE for selected race/ethnicity groups in states from 1990 
to 2019.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional time-series analysis.
SETTING: United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Deidentified death records and Census data were used to construct 
regression models with smoothed time series of mortality from 1990 to 2019.
MEASUREMENTS: LE at birth, by sex and year, for subgroups of people reporting 
Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, or non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Disparities in LE across states were 8.0 years for females and 12.2 
years for males in 1990 and 7.9 years for females and 7.8 years for males in 
2019. When race/ethnicity groups were accounted for, disparities across states 
were 20.7 years for females and 24.5 years for males in 1990, decreasing to 18.5 
years for females and 23.7 years for males in 2019. Disparities across states 
increased within each race/ethnicity group between 1990 and 2019, with the 
largest increase for non-Hispanic White males and the smallest for Hispanic 
females. The disparity between race/ethnicity groups within states decreased for 
most of the 23 states with estimates for all 3 groups but increased for females 
in 7 states and males in 5 states.
LIMITATION: Because of small sample size, LE was not estimated for 37 of 153 
state-race/ethnicity groups.
CONCLUSION: Disparity in LE across states was greater when race/ethnicity groups 
were considered. Disparities across all state-race/ethnicity groups in general 
have decreased over the past 3 decades. Within each race/ethnicity group, 
disparities across states have increased. Although racial/ethnic disparities 
decreased in most of the 23 states for which LE was estimated for all 3 groups, 
they increased for females in 7 states and males in 5 states.

INTRODUCTION: The goals of individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use 
disorder (AUD) are typically quantified as abstinent or nonabstinent (e.g., 
moderate drinking) goals. However, treatment goals can vary over time and be 
influenced by life circumstances. This study aims to identify predictors of 
treatment goal change and direction of change from baseline to six-month 
follow-up among individuals seeking treatment for AUD.
METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of data from the Relapse Replication 
and Extension Project. The study included participants who completed assessments 
at baseline and six-month follow-up in the analysis (n = 441). We used decision 
trees to examine 111 potential predictors of treatment goal change. The study 
cross-validated results using random forests. The team examined changes in goal 
between baseline and follow-up (Decision Tree 1) and quantified them as being 
toward or away from a complete abstinence goal (Decision Tree 2).
RESULTS: Nearly 50 % of the sample changed their treatment goal from baseline to 
6 months, and 68.7 % changed from a nonabstinence goal toward a complete 
abstinence goal. The study identified seven unique predictors of goal change. 
The most common predictors of changing a treatment goal were number of recent 
treatment sessions prior to enrolling in the study, other substance use, 
negative affect, anxiety, social support, and baseline drinks per drinking day. 
Participants with a greater number of recent treatment sessions and who sought 
social support were most likely to change their goal. Additionally, individuals 
with more substance use tended to change away from complete abstinence goals. 
Cross-validation supported baseline drinks per drinking day, social support, 
baseline maximum blood alcohol concentration (BAC), lifetime tobacco use, 
baseline average BAC, lifetime cocaine use, Inventory of Drinking Situations 
total score, and Situational Confidence Questionnaire average score as important 
predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified seven unique predictors of treatment goal 
change while in AUD treatment. Prior treatment, drinking to cope, and social 
support were most associated with goal changes. This information can inform 
providers who seek to understand factors associated with treatment goal 
selection and changes in goals during treatment.

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to summarize key methods for estimating years of 
life lost (YLL), highlighting their differences and how they can be implemented 
in current software, and applies them in a real-world example.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We investigated the common YLL methods: (1) Years of 
potential life lost (YPLL); (2) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) approach; (3) 
Life tables; (4) Poisson regression; and (5) Flexible parametric Royston-Parmar 
regression. We used data from UK Biobank and multimorbidity as our example.
RESULTS: For the YPLL and GBD method, the analytical procedures allow only to 
quantify the average YLL within each group (with and without multimorbidity) 
and, from them, their difference; conversely, for the other methods both the 
remaining life expectancy within each group and the YLL could be estimated. At 
65 years, the YLL in those with vs. without multimorbidity was 1.8, 1.2, and 
2.7 years using the life tables approach and the Poisson, and Royston-Parmar 
regression, respectively; corresponding values were -0.73 and -0.05 years for 
YPLL and using the GBD approach.
CONCLUSION: While deciding among different methods to estimate YLL, researchers 
should consider the purpose of the research, the type of available data, and the 
flexibility of the model.

BACKGROUND: Due to demographic changes and higher life expectancy especially in 
industrial nations, the number of liver resections in patients ≥70 years is 
rising. It is known that older age is associated with higher postoperative 
morbidity and mortality after surgery under general anesthesia. The aim of this 
analysis is to compare the postoperative outcome after liver resections for 
malignancies in patients aged below and above 70 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively collected electronic database of 1034 
liver resections between January 2013 and December 2019 was retrospectively 
analyzed. Comparative analysis of patients <70 and ≥ 70 years receiving liver 
resections for malignancies included 889 operations in 703 patients. Analysis of 
postoperative outcome and uni- and multivariate analyses of associated risk 
factors were performed.
RESULTS: Median age of the whole cohort was 65 years (range 18-87 years). 
N = 582 liver resections (65.7%) were performed in patients <70 years with 42.8% 
major hepatectomies and n = 307 (34.3%) liver resections in patients ≥70 years 
with 50.5% major hepatectomies (p = 0.034). Relevant postoperative morbidity of 
the whole cohort was 27.9%. The 30-day mortality was 3.9% and re-operation rate 
14.8%. Patients ≥70 years had significantly higher postoperative morbidity and 
mortality rates than patients <70 years. Major resections, longer operating 
time, need of intraoperative transfusions of blood products as well as 
biliodigestive anastomosis (BDA) and inferior vena cava (IVC) resection were 
independent risk factors for worse postoperative outcome.
CONCLUSION: Liver resections in patients ≥70 years are associated with a worse 
postoperative course after. Parenchyma sparing resections should be preferred in 
those patients.

BACKGROUND: More than a third of the 65,000 people living with kidney failure in 
the UK attend a dialysis unit 2-5 times a week to have their blood cleaned for 
3-5 h. In haemodialysis (HD), toxins are removed by diffusion, which can be 
enhanced using a high-flux dialyser. This can be augmented with convection, as 
occurs in haemodiafiltration (HDF), and improved outcomes have been reported in 
people who are able to achieve high volumes of convection. This study compares 
the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF compared with high-flux 
HD in the treatment of kidney failure.
METHODS: This is a UK-based, multi-centre, non-blinded randomised controlled 
trial. Adult patients already receiving HD or HDF will be randomised 1:1 to 
high-volume HDF (aiming for 21+ L of substitution fluid adjusted for body 
surface area) or high-flux HD. Exclusion criteria include lack of capacity to 
consent, life expectancy less than 3 months, on HD/HDF for less than 4 weeks, 
planned living kidney donor transplant or home dialysis scheduled within 3 
months, prior intolerance of HDF and not suitable for high-volume HDF for other 
clinical reasons. The primary outcome is a composite of non-cancer mortality or 
hospital admission with a cardiovascular event or infection during follow-up 
(minimum 32 months, maximum 91 months) determined from routine data. Secondary 
outcomes include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular- and infection-related 
morbidity and mortality, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and 
environmental impact. Baseline data will be collected by research personnel 
on-site. Follow-up data will be collected by linkage to routine healthcare 
databases - Hospital Episode Statistics, Civil Registration, Public Health 
England and the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) in England, and equivalent databases in 
Scotland and Wales, as necessary - and centrally administered patient-completed 
questionnaires. In addition, research personnel on-site will monitor for adverse 
events and collect data on adherence to the protocol (monthly during recruitment 
and quarterly during follow-up).
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence of the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of HD as compared to HDF for adults with kidney failure 
in-centre HD or HDF. It will inform management for this patient group in the UK 
and internationally.

Nanoscience paves the new way for the development of bio-based food packaging. 
Recently, research on bio-nanocomposite packaging has gained momentum, driven by 
consumers' pursuits of food quality and the reduction of resource waste. This is 
mainly attributable to its excellent biogradability, non-toxicity, consumer 
friendliness and its potential for functional properties that contribute to 
extending the shelf life of foods. Bio-nanocomposite packaging materials can be 
prepared by incorporating nano-sized additives into biopolymeric matrices. The 
review investigates how dimensional qualities of nanofillers affect functional 
properties, rather than just the biopolymer matrix as a whole. The features of 
various nanofillers were first introduced in this review. As a result, the 
functional variations amongst nanofillers of different dimensions were 
emphasized. After that, some concrete applications, the main obstacles and 
solutions were discussed in detail. Finally, a clear perspective and prospect 
for the future manufacturing and research directions of biological 
nanocomposites prepared for active packaging were presented.
