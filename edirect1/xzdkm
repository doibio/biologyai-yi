Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most common and frequently 
diagnosed malignant tumor of the pancreas with few treatment options and poor 
life expectancy. Despite the advances in the surgical field, 40% of the patients 
are diagnosed with locally advanced disease which is not suitable for surgery. 
Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) has been described as a new 'weapon' in the 
multimodal treatment of PDAC, representing a cytoreductive procedure which must 
be completed with radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy. A systematic research was 
carried out utilizing the PubMed database in regards to this subject, to 
evaluate the role of RFA in PDAC management. Abstracts, letters-to-the-editor 
and non-English language manuscripts were excluded. The literature showed that 
RFA can be used in open and laparoscopic surgery but it is also feasible for 
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS-guided RFA) or percutaneous approach. Even though we 
found optimistic and encouraging reports on overall survival (OS), randomized 
studies are still required to corroborate these findings. Our review research 
underline that surgical resection remains the only radical treatment option, RFA 
being a safe and feasible technique reserved for unresectable, non-metastatic 
pancreatic tumors. Its combination with oncological treatment can improve the OS 
of these patients.

The growing detection of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) is paralleled 
by an increase in surgical procedures. Due to the frequent indolent nature, 
cost, and risk of surgery, active surveillance (AS) and ultrasound-guided 
minimally invasive treatments (MITs) are in suitable cases of incidental PTMC 
proposed as alternatives to thyroidectomy. Surgery and radioiodine are the 
established treatments for relapsing cervical differentiated thyroid carcinoma 
(DTC) metastases. But radioiodine refractoriness, risk of surgical 
complications, adverse influence on quality of life, or declining repeat surgery 
have led to AS and MIT being considered as alternatives for slow-growing DTC 
nodal metastases. Also, for distant radioiodine-refractory metastases not 
amenable to surgery, MIT is proposed as part of a multimodality therapeutic 
approach. The European Thyroid Association and the Cardiovascular and 
Interventional Radiological Society of Europe commissioned these guidelines for 
the appropriate use of MIT. Based on a systematic PubMed search, an 
evidence-based approach was applied, and both knowledge and practical experience 
of the panelists were incorporated to develop the manuscript and the specific 
recommendations. We recommend that when weighing between surgery, radioiodine, 
AS, or MIT for DTC, a multidisciplinary team including members with expertise in 
interventional radiology assess the demographic, clinical, histological, and 
imaging characteristics for appropriate selection of patients eligible for MIT. 
Consider TA in low-risk PTMC patients who are at surgical risk, have short life 
expectancy, relevant comorbidities, or are unwilling to undergo surgery or AS. 
As laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, and microwave ablation are similarly 
safe and effective thermal ablation (TA) techniques, the choice should be based 
on the specific competences and resources of the centers. Use of ethanol 
ablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound is not recommended for PTMC 
treatment. Consider MIT as an alternative to surgical neck dissection in 
patients with radioiodine refractory cervical recurrences who are at surgical 
risk or decline further surgery. Factors that favor MIT are previous neck 
dissection, presence of surgical complications, small size metastases, and <4 
involved latero-cervical lymph nodes. Consider TA among treatment options in 
patients with unresectable oligometastatic or oligoprogressive distant 
metastases to achieve local tumor control or pain palliation. Consider TA, in 
combination with bone consolidation and external beam radiation therapy, as a 
treatment option for painful bone metastases not amenable to other established 
treatments.

In this assay, 3' RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA 3' Ends) followed by PE 
(primer extension), abbreviated as 3' RACE-PE is used to identify the mRNA 3' 
ends. The following protocol describes the amplification of the mRNA 3' ends at 
the galactose operon in E. coli and the corresponding visualization of the PCR 
products through PE. In PE, the definite primer is 5' end-labeled using [γ-(32) 
P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, which anneals to the specific DNA molecules 
within the PCR product of the 3' RACE. The conventional PE can only be used to 
locate the 5' end of an mRNA transcript since reverse transcriptase (RTase) 
polymerizes only in the 5' → 3' direction. Thus, Taq polymerase is used instead 
of RTase, PCR is performed. Therefore, we are able to locate the 3' end of the 
mRNA using this assay. The relative amount of the 3' end can be directly 
visualized and quantified by way of separating DNA products in a denaturing 8% 
urea-PAGE (Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) gel. The exact position of the 3' 
ends can be sequenced by comparison of these final DNA products with the 
corresponding DNA sequencing ladder.

As life expectancy increases, frailty and cognitive impairment have become major 
factors influencing healthy aging in elderly individuals. Frailty is a 
complicated clinical condition characterized by decreased physiological reserve 
and multisystem abnormalities. Cognitive frailty is a subtype of frailty that 
has aroused widespread concern among the scientific community and public health 
organizations. We herein review the pathogenesis of cognitive frailty, such as 
chronic inflammatory response, immunological hypofunction, imbalanced oxidative 
stress, reduced regenerative function, endocrine dysfunction, and energy 
metabolism disorder. Although existing interventions show some therapeutic 
effects, they do not meet the current clinical needs. To date, studies using 
stem cell technology for treating age-related diseases have achieved remarkable 
success. This suggests the possibility of applying stem cell treatment to 
cognitive frailty. We analyzed stem cell-based strategies for targeting 
anti-inflammation, antioxidation, regeneration, and immunoregulation using 
mesenchymal stem cells, as well as potential therapeutic targets for cognitive 
frailty. Based on this investigation, we propose a highly effective and low-cost 
stem cell-based replacement strategy. However, there is a lack of comprehensive 
research on the prospect of stem cell transplantation for improving cognitive 
frailty. In this review, we aim to provide the scientific background and a 
theoretical basis for testing cell therapy in future research.

UK Biobank (UKB) is a forward-looking epidemiological project with over 500, 000 
people aged 40 to 69, whose image extension project plans to re-invite 100, 000 
participants from UKB to perform multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging. 
Large-scale multimodal neuroimaging combined with large amounts of phenotypic 
and genetic data provides great resources to conduct brain health-related 
research. This article provides an in-depth overview of UKB in the field of 
neuroimaging. Firstly, neuroimage collection and imaging-derived phenotypes are 
summarized. Secondly, typical studies of UKB in neuroimaging areas are 
introduced, which include cardiovascular risk factors, regulatory factors, brain 
age prediction, normality, successful and morbid brain aging, environmental and 
genetic factors, cognitive ability and gender. Lastly, the open challenges and 
future directions of UKB are discussed. This article has the potential to open 
up a new research field for the prevention and treatment of neurological 
diseases.

The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV infection from a 
deadly disease to a manageable chronic condition. The life expectancy of people 
living with HIV has been prolonged dramatically. Therefore, health systems are 
now confronted with new challenges, with ever-increasing number of newly 
diagnosed cases, fuelling the pool of existing patients, with many comorbidities 
and requiring hospital admissions. Are health systems prepared to handle large 
and increasing numbers of people with HIV? We developed a HIV-Management Support 
System (MSS) to support service evaluation and management using simulation by 
capturing individual patient's pathways within HIV services in the United 
Kingdom. Two scenarios were tested: (1) the impact of increasing the number of 
diagnosed cases in steps of 5% on human resources and (2) the impact of treating 
all patients with ART on hospital admissions. A 5% increase in newly diagnosed 
HIV cases increases human resource requirements between 4% and 8%, whereas the 
impact of treating all HIV patients with ART on hospital admissions is far 
greater. HIV services are under intense pressure and managing patient and 
service needs are far more important than ever, hence the development of our HIV 
MSS is timely, to support better planning of services. Note that the HIV 
simulation model presented in this study is the first of its kind.

PURPOSE: EQ-5D and PROMIS-29 are both concise, generic measures of 
patient-reported outcomes accompanied by preference weights that allow the 
estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Both instruments are 
candidates for use in economic evaluation. However, they have different features 
in terms of the domains selected to measure respondents' self-perceived health 
and the characteristics of (and methods used to obtain) the preference weights. 
It is important to understand the relationship between the instruments and the 
implications of choosing either for the evidence used in decision-making. This 
literature review aimed to synthesise existing evidence on the relationship 
between PROMIS-29 (and measures based on it, such as PROMIS-29+2) and EQ-5D 
(both EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L).
METHODS: A literature review was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science to 
identify studies investigating the relationship between PROMIS-29 and 
EQ-5D-based instruments.
RESULTS: The literature search identified 95 unique studies, of which nine 
studies met the inclusion criteria, i.e. compared both instruments. Six studies 
examined the relationship between PROMIS-29 and EQ-5D-5L. Three main types of 
relationship have been examined in the nine studies: (a) comparing PROMIS-29 and 
EQ-5D as descriptive systems; (b) mapping PROMIS-29 domains to EQ-5D utilities; 
and (c) comparing and transforming PROMIS-29 utilities to EQ-5D utilities.
CONCLUSION: This review has highlighted the lack of evidence regarding the 
relationship between PROMIS-29 and EQ-5D. The impact of choosing either 
instrument on the evidence used in cost-effectiveness analysis is currently 
unclear. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between the 
two instruments.

OBJECTIVE: Since 2016, bevacizumab has been widely used to treat metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Indonesia. Nevertheless, the high cost of 
bevacizumab has raised the question of whether the therapy is considered 
cost-effective and should be included in the national health insurance system. 
This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab plus 
chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for the treatment of mCRC patients.
METHODS: A Markov model was applied using the perspective of the Indonesian 
healthcare system to assess cost-effectiveness. The health outcomes were 
expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) using the validated 
EuroQoL-5D-5L instrument. Data for medical costs were collected from hospital 
billings in four hospitals located in three different cities in Indonesia. 
Meanwhile, data for utility were obtained from interviewing 90 patients who came 
to the hospital. We compared those mCRC patients who received chemotherapy alone 
either with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI, versus patients who received the addition of 
bevacizumab.
RESULTS: With the perspective of societal, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of adding bevacizumab was USD 49,312 per QALY gained using 
secondary data and USD 28,446 per QALY using real world data.
CONCLUSION: Using either a healthcare or societal perspective, the addition of 
bevacizumab for mCRC treatment was considered not cost-effective.

The oomycete Albugo candida causes white rust of Brassicaceae, including 
vegetable and oilseed crops, and wild relatives such as Arabidopsis thaliana. 
Novel White Rust Resistance (WRR) genes from Arabidopsis enable new insights 
into plant/parasite co-evolution. WRR4A from Arabidopsis accession Columbia 
(Col-0) provides resistance to many but not all white rust races, and encodes a 
nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptor. Col-0 WRR4A resistance 
is broken by AcEx1, an isolate of A. candida. We identified an allele of WRR4A 
in Arabidopsis accession Øystese-0 (Oy-0) and other accessions that confers full 
resistance to AcEx1. WRR4AOy-0 carries a C-terminal extension required for 
recognition of AcEx1, but reduces recognition of several effectors recognized by 
the WRR4ACol-0 allele. WRR4AOy-0 confers full resistance to AcEx1 when expressed 
in the oilseed crop Camelina sativa.

Objectives: To determine whether children with neuromuscular disorders using 
long-term noninvasive ventilation (NIV), continuous or bilevel positive airway 
pressure, have improved health outcomes compared with alternative treatment 
strategies. Data Sources: This systematic review is an extension of a scoping 
review. The search strategy used Medical Subject Headings and free-text terms 
for "child" and "noninvasive ventilation." Studies of humans from 1990 onward 
were searched in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (Ebsco), Cochrane Library 
(Wiley), and PubMed. The results were reviewed for articles reporting on 
neuromuscular disorders and health outcomes including mortality, 
hospitalization, quality of life, lung function, sleep study parameters, and 
healthcare costs. Data Extraction: Extracted data included study design, study 
duration, sample size, age, type of NIV, follow-up period, primary disease, and 
primary and secondary outcome measures. Studies were grouped by primary disease 
into three groups: spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and 
other/multiple neuromuscular diseases. Data Synthesis: A total of 50 articles 
including 1,412 children across 36 different neuromuscular disorders are 
included in the review. Mortality is lower for children using long-term NIV 
compared with supportive care across all neuromuscular disease types. Overall, 
mortality does not differ when comparing the use of NIV with invasive mechanical 
ventilation, though heterogeneity suggests that mortality with NIV is higher for 
spinal muscular atrophy type 1 and lower for other/multiple neuromuscular 
diseases. The impact of long-term NIV on hospitalization rate differed by 
neuromuscular disease type with lower rates compared with supportive care but 
higher rates compared with supportive care use for spinal muscular atrophy type 
1, and lower rates compared with before NIV for other/multiple neuromuscular 
diseases. Overall, lung function was unaltered and sleep study parameters were 
improved from baseline by long-term NIV use. There are few data to assess the 
impact of long-term NIV use on quality of life and healthcare costs. 
Conclusions: Long-term NIV for children provides benefit for mortality, 
hospitalizations, and sleep study parameters for some sub-groups of children 
with neuromuscular disorders. High risk of bias and low study quality preclude 
strong conclusions.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that transcarotid artery 
revascularization (TCAR) has comparable outcomes to the surgical gold standard, 
carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, few studies have analyzed the cost of 
TCAR, and no study has evaluated its cost-effectiveness. The purpose of this 
study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing TCAR with CEA for 
carotid artery stenosis.
METHODS: We built a Markov microsimulation using transition probabilities and 
utilities from existing literature for symptomatic patients undergoing TCAR or 
CEA. Costs were derived from literature then converted to 2019 dollars. The 
model included six health states with monthly cycle lengths: surgery, death, 
alive after surgery, alive after myocardial infarction, alive after stroke, and 
alive after stroke and death. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were analyzed over a 5-year period. 
One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
study the impact of parameter variability on cost effectiveness.
RESULTS: For symptomatic patients, CEA cost $7821 for 2.85 QALYs, whereas TCAR 
cost $19154 for 2.92 QALYs, leading to an ICER of $152,229 per QALY gained in 
the TCAR arm. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our model was most 
sensitive to probability of restenosis, costs of TCAR, and costs of CEA. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated TCAR would be considered 
cost-effective in 49% of iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that, although 5-year costs for TCAR were greater 
than CEA, TCAR afforded greater QALYs than CEA. TCAR became cost-effective at 
6 years of follow-up.

Peak alpha frequency (PAF) reduces during cutaneous pain, but no studies have 
investigated PAF during movement-related muscle pain. Whether high-pain 
sensitive (HPS) individuals exhibit a more pronounced PAF response to pain than 
low-pain sensitive (LPS) individuals is unclear. As a pain model, twenty-four 
participants received nerve growth factor injections into a wrist extensor 
muscle at Day 0, Day 2, and Day 4. At Day 4, a subgroup of twelve participants 
also undertook eccentric wrist exercise to induce additional pain. Pain 
numerical rating scale (NRS) scores and electroencephalography were recorded at 
Day 0 (before injection), Day 4, and Day 6 for 3 minutes (eyes closed) with 
wrist at rest (Resting-state) and extension (Contraction-state). The average 
pain NRS scores in contraction-state across Days were used to divide 
participants into HPS (NRS-scores≥2) and LPS groups. PAF was calculated by 
frequency decomposition of electroencephalographic recordings. Compared with Day 
0, contraction NRS-scores only increased in HPS-group at Day 4 and Day 6 (P < 
.001). PAF in Contraction-state decreased in both groups at Day 6 compared with 
Day 0 (P = .011). Across days, HPS-group showed faster PAF than LPS-group during 
Resting-state and Contraction-state (P < .04). Average pain NRS-scores across 
days during Contraction-states correlated with PAF at Day 0 (P = .012). Pain 
NRS-scores were associated with PAF during Contraction-state at Day 4 and Day 6 
(P < .05). PERSPECTIVE: PAF was slowed during long-lasting movement-related pain 
in both groups, suggesting a widespread change in cortical excitability 
independent of the pain sensitivity. Moreover, HPS individuals showed faster PAF 
than LPS individuals during muscle pain, which may reflect a different 
cognitive, emotional, or attentional response to muscle pain among individuals.
