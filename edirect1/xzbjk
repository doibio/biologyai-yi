OBJECTIVES: Poor agreement between preference-based health-related 
quality-of-life instruments has been widely reported across patient and 
community-based samples. This study compares index scores generated from 
contemporaneous EQ-5D (3-level version) and SF-6D (SF-36 version) responses 
using scoring algorithms derived from independently-conducted Australian 
population-representative discrete choice experiments (DCEs), providing the 
first comparative analysis of health state valuations using the same method of 
valuation across the full value sets.
METHODS: EQ-5D and SF-6D responses from seven patient data sets were transformed 
into health state valuations using published DCE-derived scoring algorithms. The 
empirical comparative evaluation consisted of graphical illustration of the 
location and spread of index scores, reporting of basic descriptive statistics, 
exploration of between-measure differences in mean index scores, and analysis of 
agreement.
RESULTS: Compared with previously published findings regarding the comparability 
of "conventional" EQ-5D and SF-6D index scores, health state valuations from the 
DCE-derived scoring procedures showed that agreement between scores remained 
"fair" (intraclass correlation coefficient values across the seven data sets 
ranged from 0.375 to 0.615). Mean SF-6D scores were significantly lower than the 
respective mean EQ-5D score across all patient groups (mean difference for the 
whole sample = 0.253).
CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of disagreement previously reported between EQ-5D and 
SF-6D index scores is not ameliorated through the application of DCE-derived 
value sets; sizeable discrepancies remain. These findings suggest that 
differences between EQ-5D and SF-6D index scores persist because of their 
respective descriptive systems. Further research is required to explore the 
implications of variations in the descriptive systems of preference-based 
instruments.

OBJECTIVE: To generate a Chinese general population-based three-level EuroQol 
five-dimensios (EQ-5D-3L) social value set using the time trade-off method.
METHODS: The study sample was drawn from five cities in China: Beijing, 
Guangzhou, Shenyang, Chengdu, and Nanjing, using a quota sampling method. 
Utility values for a subset of 97 health states defined by the EQ-5D-3L 
descriptive system were directly elicited from the study sample using a modified 
Measurement and Valuation of Health protocol, with each respondent valuing 13 of 
the health states. The utility values for all 243 EQ-5D-3L health states were 
estimated on the basis of econometric models at both individual and aggregate 
levels. Various linear regression models using different model specifications 
were examined to determine the best model using predefined model selection 
criteria.
RESULTS: The N3 model based on ordinary least square regression at the aggregate 
level yielded the best model fit, with a mean absolute error of 0.020, 7 and 0 
states for which prediction errors were greater than 0.05 and 0.10, 
respectively, in absolute magnitude. This model passed tests for model 
misspecification (F = 2.7; P = 0.0509, Ramsey Regression Equation Specification 
Error Test), heteroskedasticity (χ(2) = 0.97; P = 0.3254, 
Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test), and normality of the residuals (χ(2) = 1.285; 
P = 0.5259, Jarque-Bera test). The range of the predicted values (-0.149 to 
0.887) was similar to those estimated in other countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully developed Chinese utility values for 
EQ-5D-3L health states using the time trade-off method. It is the first attempt 
ever to develop a standardized instrument for quantifying quality-adjusted 
life-years in China.

We propose a Leslie matrix model for the population dynamics of Sicyopterus 
lagocephalus in La Réunion. In order to capture both the amphidromous and the 
seasonal natures of the species' life history the model has four stages 
(sea+three river sites) and is cyclical with a 12 month period. Baseline 
parameters (age-specific fecundity, spatial dispersion patterns and survival 
rates) were chosen in such a way that the dominant eigenvalue of the 
year-on-year projection matrix is 1. Large uncertainties on the parameter values 
preclude the use of the model for management purpose. A sensitivity/uncertainty 
analysis sheds light on the parameters that cause much of the output to vary and 
that are poorly known: the life expectancy in rivers and the mortality both at 
river mouths and during the drift of larvae to sea. The aim is to help 
policymakers and researchers prioritize data acquisition efforts. The ultimate 
goal is a sustainable management of Sicyopterus lagocephalus in La Réunion.

PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were (1) to construct a theoretical Markov 
decision model to compare the total remaining quality-adjusted life-years 
following either arthroscopic management (AM) or total shoulder arthroplasty 
(TSA) for the treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis and (2) to determine the 
possible effects of age on the preferred treatment strategy.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed to compare AM and TSA in 
patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis. The rates of surgical complications, 
revision surgery, and death were derived from the literature and analyzed. The 
principal outcome measure was the mean total remaining quality-adjusted 
life-years after each treatment strategy. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
for age at the initial procedure, utilities, and transition probabilities.
RESULTS: This theoretical decision model showed that AM was the preferred 
strategy for patients younger than 47 years, TSA was the preferred strategy for 
patients older than 66 years, and both treatment strategies were reasonable for 
patients aged between 47 and 66 years. The model was highly sensitive to age at 
the index surgery, utilities of wellness states, survivorship, and the 
probability of failure after either AM or TSA.
CONCLUSIONS: According to this theoretical decision model, AM was the preferred 
treatment strategy for patients younger than 47 years, primary TSA was the 
preferred treatment strategy for patients older than 66 years, and both 
treatment options were reasonable for patients aged between 47 and 66 years.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, economic and decision analysis.

Lifespan among individuals ranges widely in organisms from yeast to mammals, 
even in an isogenic cohort born in a nearly uniform environment. Needless to 
say, genetic and environmental factors are essential for aging and lifespan, but 
in addition, a third factor or the existence of a stochastic element must be 
reflected in aging and lifespan. An essential point is that lifespan or aging is 
an unpredictable phenomenon. The present study focuses on elucidating the 
biophysical and biological meanings of healthspan that latently indwells a 
stochastic nature. To perform this purpose, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 
served as a model animal. C. elegans fed a healthy food had an extended 
healthspan as compared to those fed a conventional diet. Then, utilizing this 
phenomenon, we clarified a mechanism of healthspan extension by measuring the 
single-worm ATP and estimating the ATP noise (or the variability of the ATP 
content) among individual worms and by quantitatively analyzing biodemographic 
data with the lifespan equation that was derived from a fluctuation theory.

OBJECTIVE: Pain and depression are prevalent and treatable symptoms among 
patients with cancer, yet they are often undetected and undertreated. The 
Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial demonstrated that telecare 
management can improve pain and depression outcomes. This article investigates 
the incremental cost effectiveness of the INCPAD intervention.
METHODS: The INCPAD trial was conducted in 16 community-based urban and rural 
oncology practices in Indiana. Of the 405 participants, 202 were randomized to 
the intervention group and 203 to the usual-care group. Intervention costs were 
determined, and effectiveness outcomes were depression-free days and 
quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: The intervention group was associated with a yearly increase of 60.3 
depression-free days (S.E. = 15.4; P < 0.01) and an increase of between 0.033 
and 0.066 quality-adjusted life years compared to the usual care group. Total 
cost of the intervention per patient was US$1189, which included physician, 
nurse care manager and automated monitoring set-up and maintenance costs. 
Incremental cost per depression-free day was US$19.72, which yields a range of 
US$18,018 to US$36,035 per quality-adjusted life year when converted to that 
metric. When measured directly, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life 
year ranged from US$10,826 based on the modified EQ-5D to US$73,286.92 based on 
the SF-12.
CONCLUSION: Centralized telecare management, coupled with automated symptom 
monitoring, appears to be a cost effective intervention for managing pain and 
depression in cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: A large proportion of dementia cases are still undiagnosed. Although 
early dementia care has been hypothesized to benefit both patients and families, 
evidence-based benefits are lacking. Thus, investigating the benefits for newly 
demented persons according to their recourse to care in the "real life" appears 
critical.
METHODS: We examined the relation between initial care recourse care and 
demented individuals' survival in a large cohort of incident dementia cases 
screened in a prospective population-based cohort, the Three-City Study. We 
assessed recourse to care for cognitive complaint at the early beginning of 
dementia when incident cases were screened. We classified patients in three 
categories: no care recourse, general practitioner consultation or specialist 
consultation. We used proportional hazard regression models to test the 
association between recourse to care and mortality, adjusting on 
socio-demographical and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-three incident dementia participants were 
screened at the 2 year or 4 year follow-up. One third of the incident demented 
individuals had not consulted a physician for cognitive problems. Eighty-six 
(34.0%) individuals had reported a cognitive problem only to their general 
practitioner (GP) and 80 (31.6%) had consulted a specialist. Mean duration of 
follow-up after incident dementia was 5.1 years, during which 146 participants 
died. After adjustment on potential confounders, participants who had consulted 
a specialist early in the disease course presented a poorer survival than those 
who did not consult any physician (hazard ratio = 1.64, 95% confidence interval 
1.03-2.62). There was a trend but no significant differential survival profile 
between participants who complained to their GP and those without any care 
recourse.
CONCLUSION: Neither recourse to a specialist nor recourse to GP improve survival 
of new dementia cases. Those who had consulted a specialist early in the disease 
course even reported a worse life expectancy than those who did not.

Chronic kidney disease remains one of the main risk factors of cardiovascular 
disease. However, patients with kidney transplantation have better life 
expectancy and better quality of life compared with patients on dialysis. In 
patients with a well-functioning graft, the main cause of death is 
cardiovascular in origin. Metabolic pathways have complex effects on arterial 
function that can be monitored by conventional ultrasonography and with the 
assessment of arterial stiffness by oscillometric non-invasive technique. 
Forty-one primer cadaver kidney-transplanted patient were involved in a 3-year 
longitudinal clinical trial (21 female, 20 male; average age, 40.16 ± 12.56 
years). Arterial stiffness parameters referring to rigidity of the arterial wall 
(pulse wave velocity [PWV], augmentation index, and pulse pressure) were 
investigated. Correlation between stiffness, and laboratory parameters (serum 
creatinine, urea, hemoglobin, albumin, cholesterine, triglycerides, transferrin, 
uric acid, glomerular filtration rate, and C-reactive protein) were analyzed. A 
non-invasive oscillometric method--Tensiomed Arteriograph--was applied to assess 
the arterial stiffness parameters. Statistical analysis was performed with the 
use of Statistica for Windows, version 8.0. A value of P < .05 was considered 
statistically significant for all statistical tests. We found a positive 
correlation between PWV and left ventricular wall thickness and a negative 
correlation between PWV and ejection fraction. We also found a positive 
significant correlation between serum level of transferrin and PWV. There was 
simultaneous significant progression concerning PWV and carotid artery sclerosis 
in a 3-year follow-up. There was no fatal cardiovascular event during the study 
period among our patients. All of our patients involved in this study are still 
alive. Our findings suggest that arterial stiffness monitoring is a reliable 
method to assess global cardiovascular risk among kidney-transplanted patients. 
The oscillometric method is convenient, fast, painless technique to monitor 
arterial function, which, in the case of pathological findings, proposes more 
frequent cardiovascular control.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate our experience with total arterial 
revascularization and compare it with the traditional approach of a single 
internal thoracic artery supplemented by saphenous veins.
METHODS: From 1995 to 2010, 6059 patients with triple-vessel coronary artery 
disease underwent primary isolated coronary artery bypass grafting at 8 centers. 
A study cohort of 3774 patients was formed, with 2988 (79%) undergoing total 
arterial revascularization and 786 (21%) receiving only saphenous veins to 
supplement a single in situ internal thoracic artery. In the total arterial 
revascularization group, bilateral internal thoracic arteries were used in 1079 
patients (36%) and at least 1 radial artery was used in 2916 patients (97%). 
Propensity score matching was used for risk adjustment.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing total arterial revascularization were younger 
(65.0±10.4 years vs 71.3±7.9 years, P<.001) and less likely to have diabetes, 
cerebrovascular disease, recent myocardial infarction, and severe left 
ventricular impairment. At 15 years, patients who underwent total arterial 
revascularization experienced superior unadjusted survival (62%±1.1% vs 
35%±1.9%, P<.001). Multivariable Cox regression in the entire study cohort 
showed the total arterial group had improved survival with a hazard ratio of 
0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.90; P<.001). After propensity score 
matching yielded 384 patient pairs, patients who underwent total arterial 
revascularization showed improved survival at 15 years than patients who 
underwent single arterial revascularization (54%±3.3% vs 41%±3.0%, P=.0004).
CONCLUSIONS: This large multicenter study suggests that a strategy of total 
arterial revascularization is associated with improved long-term survival 
compared with the use of only a single arterial and saphenous vein grafts. Total 
arterial revascularization should be encouraged in patients with a reasonable 
life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Invasive Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) disease is a low 
incidence but severe infection (mean annual incidence 0.19/100,000/year, case 
fatality 11%, major long-term sequelae 10%) in Ontario, Canada. This study 
assesses the cost-effectiveness of a novel MenB vaccine from the Ontario 
healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model of invasive MenB disease based on high quality 
local data and data from the literature was developed. A 4-dose vaccination 
schedule, 97% coverage, 90% effectiveness, 66% strain coverage, 10-year duration 
of protection, and vaccine cost of C$75/dose were assumed. A hypothetical 
Ontario birth cohort (n=150,000) was simulated to estimate expected lifetime 
health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs, discounted at 
5%.
RESULTS: A MenB infant vaccination program is expected to prevent 4.6 invasive 
MenB disease cases over the lifetime of an Ontario birth cohort, equivalent to 
10 QALYs gained. The estimated program cost of C$46.6 million per cohort 
(including C$318,383 for treatment of vaccine-associated adverse events) were 
not offset by healthcare cost savings of C$150,522 from preventing MenB cases, 
resulting in an incremental cost of C$4.76 million per QALY gained. Sensitivity 
analyses showed the findings to be robust.
CONCLUSIONS: An infant MenB vaccination program significantly exceeds commonly 
used cost-effectiveness thresholds and thus is unlikely to be considered 
economically attractive in Ontario and comparable jurisdictions.

BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that two doses of HPV vaccines may be as 
protective as three doses in the short-term. We estimated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of two- and three-dose schedules of girls-only and girls & 
boys HPV vaccination programmes in Canada.
METHODS: We used HPV-ADVISE, an individual-based transmission-dynamic model of 
multi-type HPV infection and diseases (anogenital warts, and cancers of the 
cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis and oropharynx). We conducted the analysis 
from the health payer perspective, with a 70-year time horizon and 3% discount 
rate, and performed extensive sensitivity analyses, including duration of 
vaccine protection and vaccine cost.
FINDINGS: Assuming 80% coverage and a vaccine cost per dose of $85, two-dose 
girls-only vaccination (vs. no vaccination) produced cost/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY)-gained varying between $7900-24,300. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of giving the third dose to girls (vs. two doses) was 
below $40,000/QALY-gained when: (i) three doses provide longer protection than 
two doses and (ii) two-dose protection was shorter than 30 years. Vaccinating 
boys (with two or three doses) was not cost-effective (vs. girls-only 
vaccination) under most scenarios investigated.
INTERPRETATION: Two-dose HPV vaccination is likely to be cost-effective if its 
duration of protection is at least 10 years. A third dose of HPV vaccine is 
unlikely to be cost-effective if two-dose duration of protection is longer than 
30 years. Finally, two-dose girls & boys HPV vaccination is unlikely to be 
cost-effective unless the cost per dose for boys is substantially lower than the 
cost for girls.

OBJECTIVES: The burden of epilepsy, in terms of both morbidity and mortality, is 
likely to vary depending on the etiology (primary [genetic/unknown] vs. 
secondary [structural/metabolic]) and with the use of antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs). We estimated the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and modeled the 
remission rates of active convulsive epilepsy (ACE) using epidemiologic data 
collected over the last decade in rural Kilifi, Kenya.
METHODS: We used measures of prevalence, incidence, and mortality to model the 
remission of epilepsy using disease-modeling software (DisMod II). DALYs were 
calculated as the sum of Years Lost to Disability (YLD) and Years of Life Lost 
(YLL) due to premature death using the prevalence approach, with disability 
weights (DWs) from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. DALYs were 
calculated with R statistical software with the associated uncertainty intervals 
(UIs) computed by bootstrapping.
RESULTS: A total of 1,005 (95% UI 797-1,213) DALYs were lost to ACE, which is 
433 (95% UI 393-469) DALYs lost per 100,000 people. Twenty-six percent 
(113/100,000/year, 95% UI 106-117) of the DALYs were due to YLD and 74% 
(320/100,000/year, 95% UI 248-416) to YLL. Primary epilepsy accounted for fewer 
DALYs than secondary epilepsy (98 vs. 334 DALYs per 100,000 people). Those 
taking AEDs contributed fewer DALYs than those not taking AEDs (167 vs. 266 
DALYs per 100,000 people). The proportion of people with ACE in remission per 
year was estimated at 11.0% in males and 12.0% in females, with highest rates in 
the 0-5 year age group.
SIGNIFICANCE: The DALYs for ACE are high in rural Kenya, but less than the 
estimates of 2010 GBD study. Three-fourths of DALYs resulted from secondary 
epilepsy. Use of AEDs was associated with 40% reduction of DALYs. Improving 
adherence to AEDs may reduce the burden of epilepsy in this area.

hypopharyngeal cancer: balancing the benefit of efficacy and functional 
preservation.

The 5-year overall survival (OS) of loco-regionally advanced laryngeal and 
hypopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-LHC) has declined over the past two decades 
following the wide application of non-surgical approaches. We aimed to define 
the new role of open surgery combined with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the 
treatment of LA-LHC for improving survival while maintaining a functional 
larynx. In the current study, 90 LA-LHC patients treated with open surgery 
followed by postoperative RT/CRT in our institute from May 2005 to December 2012 
were retrospectively analyzed. OS, disease-free survival (DFS), loco-regional 
failure-free survival (LRFFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were 
calculated, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Functional larynx preservation 
results were evaluated according to the head and neck quality of life (QoL) 
Scale. With a median follow-up period of 37 months, the 3- and 5-year OS, DFS, 
LRFFS and DMFS were 71.3, 63.7, 85.9, 73.7 and 55.9, 53.0, 81.6, 71.9 %, 
respectively. Vascular embolism and extracapsular extension (ECE) of the lymph 
nodes were prognostic factors for poorer OS (p = 0.045 and 0.046, respectively). 
Vascular embolism was the only prognostic factor for poorer DMFS (p = 0.005). 
Patients who underwent a conservative partial laryngectomy (CPL) experienced a 
higher QoL in the domains of speech, swallowing and emotion. Functional larynx 
preservation was achieved in 36/45 patients (80 %) who received CPL. The results 
of our study demonstrated that CPL followed by adequate adjuvant therapy could 
achieve superior oncological results compared with non-surgical approaches in 
LA-LHC patients while also maintaining satisfactory functional larynx in a 
majority of patients.

BACKGROUND: Mortality in patients in psychiatric hospitals is reported to be two 
to three times as high as in the general population. In Tunisia, we do not have 
any figures on mortality and causes of death in psychiatric inpatients.
AIM: The aim of our study was to assess the mortality rate in a psychiatric 
hospital in comparison to the mortality rate in the general population, to 
determine the patients' profile, and to identify the causes and risk factors for 
these deaths.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive and comparative study. We 
examined the records of all patients who died during their stay in the different 
wards of psychiatry at the Razi Hospital in Tunis. We also scrutinized reports 
of autopsies in the Forensic Medicine unit at Charles-Nicolle Hospital in Tunis 
over a period of eleven years from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2010. We 
conducted a descriptive study to calculate the standardized mortality ratio 
(SMR) aiming to highlight any existing excess mortality among the psychiatric 
inpatients compared to the general population. This ratio was obtained by 
dividing the observed number of deaths by the expected number of deaths. In the 
analytical study, our sample was compared to a control population made-up of 
randomly selected living patients among those admitted to the Razi hospital in 
2010. This study allowed us to investigate the risk factors for premature 
mortality in psychiatric inpatients.
RESULTS: The average rate of mortality was two deaths per 1000 inpatients per 
year. Twenty-four percent (24%) of deaths involved institutionalized patients. 
Compared to the general population, premature mortality was noted among patients 
aged less than 40 (SMR=1.9). The older the patients were, the closer to 1 the 
SMR was. The average age at death was 51.38 years; 65% of patients were male, 
60% had a low socio-economic level, 54% had a comorbid medical condition. 
Forty-two percent (42%) of deceased patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia 
with the paranoid form being the most prevalent (44%), 13% had bipolar disorder, 
22% had psycho-organic disorders (mental retardation, dementia, delirium). 
Antipsychotics were the most prescribed psychotropic drugs. High doses were 
used. Forty percent of cases (40%) consisted of sudden deaths. A cause for death 
was identified in 80% of cases. In 92% of cases, the death was classified as 
being "natural". Main causes were respiratory (26%) and cardiovascular (9%). 
Accidental causes accounted for 8% of deaths. In 20% of cases, the cause 
remained undetermined. Three factors were identified as independent predictors 
of mortality among mental patients: age at death (OR=3.9 among patients older 
than 40), psychiatric diagnosis (OR=2.9 among patients with psychotic or mood 
disorders compared to other diagnoses) and combination of antipsychotic drugs 
(OR=6.09 in patients receiving more than two antipsychotics).
DISCUSSION: Young psychiatric inpatients seem to be at high risk of premature 
death: the SMR in our study was 1.9. It ranged between 2.15 and 6.55 in other 
similar studies. This increased risk mainly concerns non-natural deaths. The 
leading natural cause of death in our population was represented by 
thromboembolic accidents. Such a high thromboembolic risk may be explained by 
the mental illness itself, by physical restraint as well as by antipsychotic 
treatment. Diagnosing medical conditions in psychiatric patients is often a 
daunting task: history of the patient is sometimes unreliable and clinical 
features might be modified by psychotropic agents. Patient-related risk factors 
for premature death include poor socio-economic level, access-to-care 
difficulties, positive family and personal history of mental and/or medical 
disorders, smoking, substance abuse, unhealthy diet and lack of physical 
activity. Moreover, iatrogenic effects of psychotropic drugs (combination of 
antipsychotics was more common in deceased patients than in controls) and 
inadequate medical care in psychiatric hospitals (lack of ECG devices, in 
particular) partly account for such a high mortality.
CONCLUSION: Identifying risk factors for deaths in psychiatric hospitals 
highlights needed changes in psychiatric management strategies taking into 
account the patient's characteristics as well as the drugs' safety profile. 
Further studies with larger samples are needed to better highlight risk factors 
for premature death in psychiatric inpatients. Identifying such risk factors is 
necessary to develop efficient preventive strategies.

Sublethal effects of the beta-blocker sotalol at environmentally relevant 
concentrations on the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum.

Monitoring sublethal effects of pharmaceuticals on nontarget species in aquatic 
environments has become an important topic in ecotoxicology, yet few studies 
have been conducted concerning the effects of beta-blockers on aquatic 
organisms. The present study investigated the effects of the beta-blocker 
sotalol (SOT) at 3 environmentally relevant concentrations on life-history 
traits of the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Based on the 
pharmacodynamic properties of SOT, the authors hypothesized reduced numbers of 
embryos in the brood pouches, decelerated growth of adult snails, and smaller 
size of neonates, but no effect on mortality rates of adults. Contrary to the 
hypothesis, the total number of embryos was significantly higher after 56 d of 
exposure at nominal concentrations of 0.05 µg/L and 1.0 µg/L by 107% and 73%, 
respectively. No differences in embryo numbers were observed at earlier 
time-points. Therefore, the mode of action seems to be an extension of the 
reproductive period rather than an increase of the embryo production. 
Furthermore, our results indicate a hormetic dose-response relationship, because 
no effects were observed at the highest test-concentration (6.5 µg/L). 
Mortality, growth of adult snails, and neonate sizes were not affected by the 
beta-blocker. Given the strong influence on reproduction, the effects of 
sublethal concentrations of SOT and other beta-blockers deserve better 
consideration in ecotoxicological risk assessment.

The scientific quest for lasting youth: prospects for curing aging.

de Magalhães JP(1).

Author information:

University of Liverpool , Liverpool, United Kingdom .

People have always sought eternal life and everlasting youth. Recent 
technological breakthroughs and our growing understanding of aging have given 
strength to the idea that a cure for human aging can eventually be developed. As 
such, it is crucial to debate the long-term goals and potential impact of the 
field. Here, I discuss the scientific prospect of eradicating human aging. I 
argue that curing aging is scientifically possible and not even the most 
challenging enterprise in the biosciences. Developing the means to abolish aging 
is also an ethical endeavor because the goal of biomedical research is to allow 
people to be as healthy as possible for as long as possible. There is no 
evidence, however, that we are near to developing the technologies permitting 
radical life extension. One major difficulty in aging research is the time and 
costs it takes to do experiments and test interventions. I argue that unraveling 
the functioning of the genome and developing predictive computer models of human 
biology and disease are essential to increase the accuracy of medical 
interventions, including in the context of life extension, and exponential 
growth in informatics and genomics capacity might lead to rapid progress. 
Nonetheless, developing the tools for significantly modifying human biology is 
crucial to intervening in a complex process like aging. Yet in spite of advances 
in areas like regenerative medicine and gene therapy, the development of 
clinical applications has been slow and this remains a key hurdle for achieving 
radical life extension in the foreseeable future.

Topoisomerase inhibitors are in common use as chemotherapeutic agents although 
they can display reduced efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant tumours, which have 
inactivated DNA damage response (DDR) genes, such as ATM and TP53. Here, we 
characterise the cellular response to the dual-acting agent, Alchemix (ALX), 
which is a modified anthraquinone that functions as a topoisomerase inhibitor as 
well as an alkylating agent. We show that ALX induces a robust DDR at nano-molar 
concentrations and this is mediated primarily through ATR- and DNA-PK- but not 
ATM-dependent pathways, despite DNA double strand breaks being generated after 
prolonged exposure to the drug. Interestingly, exposure of epithelial tumour 
cell lines to ALX in vitro resulted in potent activation of the G2/M checkpoint, 
which after a prolonged arrest, was bypassed allowing cells to progress into 
mitosis where they ultimately died by mitotic catastrophe. We also observed 
effective killing of lymphoid tumour cell lines in vitro following exposure to 
ALX, although, in contrast, this tended to occur via activation of a 
p53-independent apoptotic pathway. Lastly, we validate the effectiveness of ALX 
as a chemotherapeutic agent in vivo by demonstrating its ability to cause a 
significant reduction in tumour cell growth, irrespective of TP53 status, using 
a mouse leukaemia xenograft model. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 
ALX, through its dual action as an alkylating agent and topoisomerase inhibitor, 
represents a novel anti-cancer agent that could be potentially used clinically 
to treat refractory or relapsed tumours, particularly those harbouring mutations 
in DDR genes.

OBJECTIVES: Climate change influences human health in various ways, and 
quantitative assessments of the effect of climate change on health at national 
level are becoming essential for environmental health management.
STUDY DESIGN: This study quantified the burden of disease attributable to 
climate change in Korea using disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and 
projected how this would change over time.
METHODS: Diseases related to climate change in Korea were selected, and 
meteorological data for each risk factor of climate change were collected. 
Mortality was calculated, and a database of incidence and prevalence was 
established. After measuring the burden of each disease, the total burden of 
disease related to climate change was assessed by multiplying 
population-attributable fractions. Finally, an estimation model for the burden 
of disease was built based on Korean climate data.
RESULTS: The total burden of disease related to climate change in Korea was 6.85 
DALY/1000 population in 2008. Cerebrovascular diseases induced by heat waves 
accounted for 72.1% of the total burden of disease (hypertensive disease 1.82 
DALY/1000 population, ischaemic heart disease 1.56 DALY/1000 population, 
cerebrovascular disease 1.56 DALY/1000 population). According to the estimation 
model, the total burden of disease will be 11.48 DALY/1000 population in 2100, 
which is twice the total burden of disease in 2008.
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantified the burden of disease caused by climate 
change in Korea, and provides valuable information for determining the 
priorities of environmental health policy in East Asian countries with similar 
climates.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in High-risk Infants - an Update on 
Palivizumab Prophylaxis.

Resch B(1).

Graz, Austria; Research Unit for Neonatal Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology, 
Medical University of Graz, Austria.

Morbidity due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease is still high in 
infants and children worldwide during the first two to five years of life. 
Certain categories of high-risk infants with increased morbidity and mortality 
attributed to RSV disease have been identified and are included in national 
recommendations for prophylaxis with the monoclonal RSV antibody palivizumab. 
Most guidelines recommend palivizumab for preterm infants born less than or 
equal to 32 weeks gestational age with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 
those born between 33 and 35 weeks gestational age with additional risk factors, 
and infants and children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart 
disease. Over the last years several rare diseases have been identified 
demonstrating high morbidity associated with RSV disease, thus, extension of 
guidelines for the prophylaxis with palivizumab for these patients with rare 
diseases including children with malignancy, congenital and acquired immune 
deficiency, Down syndrome, neuromuscular impairment, cystic fibrosis, congenital 
diaphragmatic hernia and other severe respiratory disease is increasingly 
discussed. Efficacy of palivizumab prophylaxis is documented by meta-analysis, 
and different economic analyses demonstrate cost-effectiveness of palivizumab 
for the most common indications during the first RSV season.
