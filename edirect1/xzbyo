Time-Series Modeling and Simulation for Comparative Cost-Effective Analysis in 
Cancer Chemotherapy: An Application to Platinum-Based Regimens for Advanced 
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

University.

The purpose of this study was to propose a time-series modeling and simulation 
(M&S) strategy for probabilistic cost-effective analysis in cancer chemotherapy 
using a Monte-Carlo method based on data available from the literature. The 
simulation included the cost for chemotherapy, for pharmaceutical care for 
adverse events (AEs) and other medical costs. As an application example, we 
describe the analysis for the comparison of four regimens, cisplatin plus 
irinotecan, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, cisplatin plus gemcitabine (GP), and 
cisplatin plus vinorelbine, for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The 
factors, drug efficacy explained by overall survival or time to treatment 
failure, frequency and severity of AEs, utility value of AEs to determine QOL, 
the drugs' and other medical costs in Japan, were included in the model. The 
simulation was performed and quality adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. An index, percentage of 
superiority (%SUP) which is the rate of the increased cost vs. QALY-gained plots 
within the area of positive QALY-gained and also below some threshold values of 
the ICER, was calculated as functions of threshold values of the ICER. An M&S 
process was developed, and for the simulation example, the GP regimen was the 
most cost-effective, in case of threshold values of the ICER=&#36;70000/year, 
the %SUP for the GP are more than 50%. We developed an M&S process for 
probabilistic cost-effective analysis, this method would be useful for 
decision-making in choosing a cancer chemotherapy regimen in terms of 
pharmacoeconomic.

Introduction Tinnitus is a symptom that affects mainly the elderly and can 
negatively influence their quality of life. Objective The objective of our study 
is to evaluate the existence of a relationship between the quality of life and 
the impact caused by tinnitus in elderly individuals, considering the age and 
gender variables. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study in elderly people 
of both genders who participate in the extension activities at the university. 
The evaluation was composed of anamnesis and WHOQOL-OLD instruments, to evaluate 
the quality of life, and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) for the evaluation of 
the tinnitus impact. Result We evaluated 36 elderly individuals with an average 
age of 68.6 ± 6.8 years old, 72.2 % of them were women. We verified that most of 
the subjects classified their tinnitus as weak (44.4%) or medium (36.1%). The 
score average in the THI was 20 points, with predominant classification of 
tinnitus impact as negligible (41.7%) or mild (30.6%). In the WHOQOL-OLD, the 
average score was 15.6 ± 1.6 points (total score). The negative correlation 
between the THI score and the WHOQOL-OLD score was found in the sensory domain 
operation and total score. Conclusion The results obtained in the study prove 
that the quality of life of the elderly individuals evaluated is related to a 
discomfort caused by the tinnitus.

BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that care experiences for complex HF patients 
could be improved by simple organizational and process changes, rather than 
complex clinical mechanisms. This survey identifies care gaps and recommends 
simple changes.
METHODS: The study utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods at The 
Ottawa Hospital, Geriatric Medical Unit during a three-month period.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients (average age 85, 12 female) surveyed. Twelve 
participants lived alone. Fourteen lived in own home. Four patients had formal 
home-care services. Fifteen relied on family. Gaps were identified in in-patient 
practice, discharge plan, and discharge summary implementation feedback. Only 
five participants had seen cardiologist or specialist. Half of patients did not 
know if they were on a special HF diet. Participants did not recall receiving 
information on life expectancy but were comfortable discussing EoL care and 
dying. HF-specific management recommendations were mentioned in only 37% of 
discharge summaries to PCPs.
CONCLUSION: The results provide the starting point for a quality assurance and 
process re-engineering program in GMU. Organization change is needed to develop 
and integrate a cardiogeriatric clinical framework to allow the cardiologist, 
geriatrician, and PCP to actively work as a team with the patient/caregiver to 
develop the optimal care plan pre- and post-discharge.

The long-term increase in international health spending sparked concerns about 
sustainability of health care systems but also the impact of such spending and 
the value for money from health spending. The period since 1975 has witnessed an 
increase in per capita health spending in Canada along with improvements in 
health outcomes. This paper is an economic evaluation of health spending in 
Canada-an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of aggregate health spending. 
Estimates of the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) are made for the 
whole 1980-2012 period and for four sub-periods of time-1980-1989; 1989-1998; 
1998-2007 and 2007-2012. This is done for both the general population as well as 
Canadian seniors. Under a medium contribution of health spending to life 
expectancy scenario for the 1980-2012 period, the costs per QALY gained averaged 
$16,977 and $14,968, respectively for the general population and the seniors. 
This suggests that the Canadian health system produces relatively good value for 
money, especially for the seniors. After applying separate adjustments to match 
total health spending in the US and NHS health spending in the UK, we found that 
costs per QALY gained in Canada were generally lower than those found for the 
US, but not for the UK.

Global Warming and Its Health Impact.

Carità", Novara, Italy. arossati@yahoo.com.

Since the mid-19th century, human activities have increased greenhouse gases 
such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere 
that resulted in increased average temperature. The effects of rising 
temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, 
desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced 
fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and 
depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, 
causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, 
malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to 
complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters 
has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, 
a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, 
climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of 
water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation 
of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the 
transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income 
countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change 
in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks 
associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of 
leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. 
Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne 
pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to 
climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a 
cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. 
A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the 
completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in 
the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the 
most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. 
Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because 
rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, 
and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence 
of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of 
geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the 
health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in 
order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.

BACKGROUND: Dressage horses are often asked to work in lengthened paces during 
training and competition, but to date there is limited information about the 
biomechanics of dressage-specific paces. Preliminary work has shown increased 
fetlock extension in extended compared with collected paces, but further 
investigation of the kinematic differences between collected, medium and 
extended trot in dressage horses is warranted.
OBJECTIVES: Investigation of the effect of collected vs. medium/extended trot on 
limb kinematics of dressage horses.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective kinematic evaluation.
METHODS: Twenty clinically sound horses in active dressage training were used. 
Group 1: Ten young horses (≤6 years) were assessed at collected and medium trot 
and Group 2: Ten mature horses (≥9 years) were assessed at collected and 
extended trot. All horses were evaluated on two different surfaces. High speed 
motion capture (240 Hz) was used to determine kinematic variables. Fore- and 
hindlimb angles were measured at mid-stance. Descriptive statistics and mixed 
effect multilevel regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Speed and stride length were reduced and stride duration increased at 
collected compared with medium/extended trot. Lengthened trot (medium/extended 
trot) was associated with increased fetlock extension in both the fore- and 
hindlimbs in both groups of horses. Changes were greater in mature horses 
compared with young horses. Shoulder and carpus angles were associated with 
forelimb fetlock angle. Hock angle was not significantly influenced by pace. 
Surface had no effect on fetlock or hock angles.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: Only 2D motion analysis was carried out. Results may have 
differed in horses with more extreme gait characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Medium/extended trot increases extension of the fore- and hindlimb 
fetlock joints compared with collected trot in both young and mature dressage 
horses, respectively.

BACKGROUND: The use of mesh in prolapse surgery is controversial, leading to a 
number of enquiries into its safety and efficacy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare synthetic non-absorbable mesh inlay, biological graft and 
mesh kit with a standard repair in terms of clinical effectiveness, adverse 
effects, quality of life (QoL), costs and cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN: Two randomised controlled trials within a comprehensive cohort (CC) 
study. Allocation was by a remote web-based randomisation system in a 1 :1 : 1 
ratio (Primary trial) or 1 : 1 : 2 ratio (Secondary trial), and was minimised on 
age, type of prolapse repair planned, need for a concomitant continence 
procedure, need for a concomitant upper vaginal prolapse procedure and surgeon. 
Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to randomisation; participants 
were unblinded if they requested the information. Surgeons were not blinded to 
allocated procedure.
SETTING: Thirty-five UK hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Primary study: 2474 women in the analysis (including 1348 
randomised) having primary anterior or posterior prolapse surgery. Secondary 
study: 398 in the analysis (including 154 randomised) having repeat anterior or 
posterior prolapse surgery. CC3: 215 women having either uterine or vault 
prolapse repair.
INTERVENTIONS: Anterior or posterior repair alone, or with mesh inlay, 
biological graft or mesh kit.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prolapse symptoms [Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score 
(POP-SS)]; prolapse-specific QoL; cost-effectiveness [incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)].
RESULTS: Primary trials: adjusting for baseline and minimisation covariates, 
mean POP-SS was similar for each comparison {standard 5.4 [standard deviation 
(SD) 5.5] vs. mesh 5.5 (SD 5.1), mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) -0.70 to 0.71; standard 5.5 (SD 5.6) vs. graft 5.6 (SD 5.6), MD 
-0.15, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.63}. Serious non-mesh adverse effects rates were 
similar between the groups in year 1 [standard 7.2% vs. mesh 7.8%, risk ratio 
(RR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.72; standard 6.3% vs. graft 9.8%, RR 1.57, 95% CI 
0.95 to 2.59]. There were no statistically significant differences between 
groups in any other outcome measure. The cumulative mesh complication rates over 
2 years were 2 of 430 (0.5%) for standard repair (trial 1), 46 of 435 (10.6%) 
for mesh inlay and 2 of 368 (0.5%) for biological graft. The CC findings were 
comparable. Incremental costs were £363 (95% CI -£32 to £758) and £565 (95% CI 
£180 to £950) for mesh and graft vs. standard, respectively. Incremental QALYs 
were 0.071 (95% CI -0.004 to 0.145) and 0.039 (95% CI -0.041 to 0.120) for mesh 
and graft vs. standard, respectively. A Markov decision model extrapolating 
trial results over 5 years showed standard repair had the highest probability of 
cost-effectiveness, but results were surrounded by considerable uncertainty. 
Secondary trials: there were no statistically significant differences between 
the randomised groups in any outcome measure, but the sample size was too small 
to be conclusive. The cumulative mesh complication rates over 2 years were 7 of 
52 (13.5%) for mesh inlay and 4 of 46 (8.7%) for mesh kit, with no mesh 
exposures for standard repair.
CONCLUSIONS: In women who were having primary repairs, there was evidence of no 
benefit from the use of mesh inlay or biological graft compared with standard 
repair in terms of efficacy, QoL or adverse effects (other than mesh 
complications) in the short term. The Secondary trials were too small to provide 
conclusive results.
LIMITATIONS: Women in the Primary trials included some with a previous repair in 
another compartment. Follow-up is vital to identify any long-term potential 
benefits and serious adverse effects.
FUTURE WORK: Long-term follow-up to at least 6 years after surgery is ongoing to 
identify recurrence rates, need for further prolapse surgery, adverse effects 
and cost-effectiveness.

Left atrial invasion by lung cancer via haematogenous pathways is a relatively 
uncommon but potentially life-threatening event. While several cardiac 
complications of cardiac involvement have been previously described, the 
evolution towards cerebral stroke has been rarely reported. In this case report, 
we describe an atypical case of haematogenous metastatic invasion of the left 
atrium from pulmonary neoplasm extension presenting as an ipsilateral stroke 
whose ASCO classification changed during the clinical management.

Kim MS(1), Kim S(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea.

PURPOSE: Owing to increased life expectancy, the number of elderly patients with 
gastric cancer has increased. This study aimed to identify the outcomes of 
gastric cancer patients aged 80 years or older through comparison of their 
clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and oncologic outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2006 and December 2013, the records of 
478 patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer were retrospectively 
evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups: patients <80 years old (n=446) 
and patients ≥80 years old (n=32).
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, body mass index, length 
of hospital stay, duration of surgery, depth of invasion, nodal metastasis, 
histologic type, or tumor size between the two groups. However, significant 
differences were found for the American Society of Anesthesiologist score and 
the serum albumin level between the two groups. Postoperative morbidity, 
mortality, disease-free survival, and recurrence rate did not differ between 
curatively resected patients in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with gastric cancer, active treatment including 
radical gastrectomy is necessary.

OBJECTIVES: One of the most common head and neck cancers is nasopharynx cancer. 
Knowledge about the incidence and mortality of this disease and its distribution 
in terms of geographical areas is necessary for further study and better 
planning. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of determining the 
incidence and mortality rates of nasopharynx cancer and its relationship with 
the Human Development Index (HDI) in Asia in 2012.
METHODS: The aim of this ecologic study was to assess the correlation between 
age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) and age-specific mortality rate (ASMR) with 
HDI and its components, which include the following: life expectancy at birth, 
mean years of schooling, and gross national income per capita. Data about SIR 
and SMR for every Asian country for 2012 were obtained from the global cancer 
project. We used the correlation bivariate method for the assessment. 
Statistical significance was assumed if p < 0.05. All reported p values are 
two-sided. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 15.0, SPSS 
Inc.).
RESULTS: A total of 68,272 cases (males, 71.02%; females, 28.97%; sex ratio, 
2.45) and 40,530 mortalities (males, 71.63%; females, 28.36%; sex ratio, 2.52) 
were recorded in Asian countries in 2012. The five countries with the highest 
ASIR of nasopharynx cancer were Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, and 
Brunei, and the five countries with the highest ASMR were Indonesia, Vietnam, 
Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei. The correlation between HDI and ASIR was 0.097 
(p = 0.520) [0.105 in men (p = 0.488) and 0.119 in women (p = 0.901)]. The 
correlation between HDI and ASMR was -0.102 (p = 0.502) [-0.072 in men 
(p = 0.633) and -0.224 in women (p = 0.134)].
CONCLUSION: Nasopharynx cancer is native to Southeast Asia. The highest 
incidence and mortality rates are found in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, 
Vietnam, and Brunei. No significant relation was found between the standardized 
incidence and mortality rates of nasopharynx cancer and the HDI components. 
Further studies are recommended in Southeast Asian countries in order to find 
the etiology of cancer, as well as its diagnosis and treatment.

Due to the increasing demographic changes and the fact that cardiovascular 
diseases are still the leading cause of death, the mean chronological age of 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery is steadily increasing. In 2015, 14.8% of 
these patients were aged 80 years and older. This meta-analysis reviewed if and 
under what circumstances elderly patients benefit from cardiac surgical 
procedures without running the risk of limitations in the quality of life and 
high rates of morbidity and mortality. Generally, the chronological age was not 
a risk factor for higher perioperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality 
but the biological age was the critical factor, in particular the associated 
comorbidities of patients and the timing of the surgical procedure in the course 
of the disease. The result is that elective operations resulted in a better 
outcome than operations in a symptomatic or decompensated stage of a disease. 
Compared to patients receiving conventional medicinal therapy, elderly patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery had an improved life expectancy. A significant 
increase in the quality of life could also be identified and was ultimately 
comparable to those of younger patients after cardiac surgery; therefore,

surgery, as long as individually adapted operative techniques are considered.

Esophageal diverticula are comparatively rare. The majority are Zenker's 
diverticula but parabronchial and epiphrenic diverticula can also occur. 
Parabronchial diverticula are of low clinical relevance, whereas Zenker's and 
epiphrenic diverticula both belong to the group of pulsion diverticula and can 
become clinically apparent by dysphagia and regurgitation. Approximately 100 
years after the first surgical treatment, peroral approaches (e.g. stapler 
dissection and flexible endoscopic diverticulotomy) have now achieved a certain 
level of importance. Both approaches are less invasive than the open approach 
but are evidently more prone to recurrences. Accordingly, traditional open 
diverticulectomy with cervical myotomy should be recommended to patients with 
a reasonable life expectancy and an acceptable operative risk. This holds 
particularly true for Brombart stages I-III of the disease, as complete myotomy 
cannot be achieved via the peroral access. The classical surgical treatment of 
epiphrenic diverticula is open or laparoscopic/thoracoscopic diverticulectomy 
with distal myotomy, mostly combined with an anterior partial fundoplication; 
however, the leakage rate is high and several alternative options are currently 
being evaluated.

Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most frequent tumor entities worldwide. The 
treatment of elderly and mostly polymorbid patients is an outstanding challenge 
in view of the demographic change with a continuously aging community. Due to 
the demographic changes the numbers of elderly (>65 years) and very old 
(≥80 years) patients are steadily increasing in surgical cohorts. This has 
resulted in higher morbidity and mortality rates in comparison to younger 
patients, with increased wound healing and cardiovascular complications but with 
comparable numbers of anastomotic insufficiency. Multivariate analysis revealed 
age ≥80 years, higher ASA status and emergency operations as independent risk 
factors for increased in-hospital mortality. With respect to the localization of 
colorectal cancer a shift to the right has been observed with increasing patient 
age. Whether minimally invasive surgical techniques can reduce postoperative 
morbidity and mortality rates in elderly patients requires further evaluation. 
Nevertheless, a reduction of both was reported without compromising the 
oncological result. Elderly patients require individualized treatment 
modalities, which take the extent of comorbidities and personal environment into 
consideration. So far, the cohort of octogenarians has not been adequately 
considered in current guidelines; therefore, geriatric expertise is recommended 
to be able to make a better assessment of benefit-risk ratios, as age itself has 
no impact on the decision for therapy.

BACKGROUND: Access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has decreased 
mortality in HIV-positive people. We aimed to estimate the expected additional 
years of life in HIV-positive Thai people after starting cART through the 
National AIDS Program (NAP), administered by the Thai National Health Security 
Office (NHSO).
METHODS: The NHSO database collects characteristics of all Thai HIV-infected 
patients through the National AIDS Program, including linkage with the National 
Death Registry for vital status. This study included patients aged ≥15 years at 
cART initiation between 2008 and 2014. The abridged life table method was used 
to construct life tables stratified by sex and baseline CD4+ T-cell count. Life 
expectancy was defined as the additional years of life from age at starting 
cART.
RESULTS: 201,688 eligible patients were included in analyses, contributing 
618,837 person-years of follow-up. Median CD4+ T-cell count was 109 cells/mm3 
and median age 37 years. The overall life expectancy after cART initiation at 
age 20 was 25.4 (95% CI, 25.3, 25.6) years and 20.6 (95% CI, 20.5, 20.7) at age 
35 years. Life expectancy at baseline CD4+ T-cell count ≥350 cells/mm3 was 51.9 
(95% CI, 51.0, 52.9) years for age 20 years and 43.2 (95% CI, 42.4, 44.1) years 
for age 35 years, close to life expectancy in the general Thai population.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing life expectancy with higher baseline CD4+ T-cell counts 
supports the guideline recommendations to start cART irrespective of CD4+ T-cell 
count. These results are beneficial to forecast the treatment cost and develop 
health policies for people living with HIV in Thailand and Asia.

PURPOSE: The ocular half-life of intravitreally (IVT) injected drugs is of major 
relevance for the suitability of a drug intended for chronic intraocular 
treatment, as the half-life determines the dosing frequency. Thus, half-life 
extension principles are very attractive as they can reduce the IVT dosing 
frequency. In this study, we investigated the ocular pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
the IVT injected Nanobody® BI-X and whether the noncovalent binding of BI-X to 
vitreous albumin could increase its ocular half-life.
METHODS: Wistar rats were dosed IVT with 3 μg BI-X alone or coadministered with 
human serum albumin (HSA), and the ocular exposure was measured in a pilot 
experiment using whole eye homogenates. New Zealand White rabbits received IVT 
injections of 500 μg BI-X alone or coadministration with HSA. Concentrations of 
BI-X were determined in aqueous humor, vitreous body and plasma and 
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated.
RESULTS: Ocular concentrations of BI-X in rats were about 10- or 3-fold higher 
at 24 and 72 h, respectively, when dosed with HSA. In rabbits, coadministration 
with albumin led to an about 3-fold increased vitreous half-life and an about 
5-fold higher exposure in vitreous humor.
CONCLUSION: As small amounts of albumin are present in the vitreous body of 
healthy human eyes and the albumin concentration is even increased under disease 
conditions like diabetic retinopathy, high affinity binding to albumin may be a 
promising strategy to extend the half-life of IVT injected drugs, allowing for 
longer dosing intervals.

People with severe mental illness (SMI) have reduced life expectancy compared 
with the general population, which can be explained partly by their increased 
risk of diabetes. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the clinical 
effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for 
improving glycaemic control in people with SMI (PROSPERO registration: 
CRD42015015558). A systematic literature search was performed on 30/10/2015 to 
identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with SMI, with or without 
a diagnosis of diabetes that measured fasting blood glucose or glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c). Screening and data extraction were carried out 
independently by two reviewers. We used random effects meta-analysis to estimate 
effectiveness, and subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression to explore 
heterogeneity. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess risk of 
bias. We found 54 eligible RCTs in 4,392 adults (40 pharmacological, 13 
behavioural, one mixed intervention). Data for meta-analysis were available from 
48 RCTs (n = 4052). Both pharmacological (mean difference (MD), -0.11mmol/L; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), [-0.19, -0.02], p = 0.02, n = 2536) and behavioural 
interventions (MD, -0.28mmol//L; 95% CI, [-0.43, -0.12], p<0.001, n = 956) were 
effective in lowering fasting glucose, but not HbA1c (pharmacological MD, 
-0.03%; 95% CI, [-0.12, 0.06], p = 0.52, n = 1515; behavioural MD, 0.18%; 95% 
CI, [-0.07, 0.42], p = 0.16, n = 140) compared with usual care or placebo. In 
subgroup analysis of pharmacological interventions, metformin and antipsychotic 
switching strategies improved HbA1c. Behavioural interventions of longer 
duration and those including repeated physical activity had greater effects on 
fasting glucose than those without these characteristics. Baseline levels of 
fasting glucose explained some of the heterogeneity in behavioural interventions 
but not in pharmacological interventions. Although the strength of the evidence 
is limited by inadequate trial design and reporting and significant 
heterogeneity, there is some evidence that behavioural interventions, 
antipsychotic switching, and metformin can lead to clinically important 
improvements in glycaemic measurements in adults with SMI.

Objective: To assess the disease burden attributable to household air pollution 
in 1990 and 2013 in China. Methods: Based on data from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2013 in China (GBD 2013), we used population attributable 
fractions (PAF) to analyze the burden of different diseases attributable to 
solid-fuel household pollution in 2013 in China(not inclnding HongKang, Macao, 
Taiwan). We compared PAF, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) 
for diseases attributable to solid-fuel household pollution in 31 provinces in 
mainland China in 1990 and 2013, and stratified the burden by age group. The 
estimated world average population during 2000- 2025 was used to calculate 
age-standardized mortality and DALY rates. Results: In 2013, 14.9% of lower 
respiratory infections in children <5, 32.5% of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), 12.0% of ischemic stroke, 14.2% of hemorrhagic stroke, 10.9% of 
ischemic heart disease, and 13.7% of lung cancer were attributable to solid-fuel 
household pollution. In addition, 807 000 deaths were attributable to solid-fuel 
household pollution, including 296 000 from COPD, 169 000 from hemorrhagic 
stroke, 152 000 from ischemic heart disease, 88 000 from ischemic stroke, 75 000 
from lung cancer, and 28 000 from lower respiratory infections in children <5. 
The age-standardized mortality rate from solid-fuel household pollution 
decreased by 59.3% from 158.8/100 000 in 1990 to 64.6/100 000 in 2013. The 
age-standardized mortality rate from solid-fuel household pollution decreased in 
all 31 provinces, with the highest decline observed in Shanghai (96.3%), and 
lowest in Xinjiang (39.9%). In 2013, the age-standardized DALY rate from 
solid-fuel household pollution was highest in Guizhou (2 233.0/100 000) and 
lowest in Shanghai (27.0/100 000). The DALY rate was the highest for the >70 age 
group (7 006.0/100 000). Compared with 1990, the 2013 mortality rate and DALY 
rate from solid-fuel household pollution decreased in all age groups, with the 
highest decline observed in the <5 age group (91.9% and 91.8% , respectively). 
Conclusion: Although the disease burden attributable to household air pollution 
decreased notably between 1990 and 2013, household pollution caused a high 
number of deaths and DALY loss in certain western provinces.

Objective: From the perspective of health economics, to evaluate 23 pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccination programme among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) patient. Methods: In the pilot counties of the project of integrated care 
pathway for COPD patient (Hanbin district of Hanzhong city in Shanxi Province, 
Qianjian district of Qingqing city, Huandao district of Qindao city in Shangdong 
Province, Wen county of Jiaozuo city in Henan Province), information of 
insurance participants of New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCS) was 
collected by local NRCM information system, which included general information 
as well as records of medical care and medical fee. Nonprobability sampling 
method was applied to select a total of 860 objects, who were over 60 years old 
with local household registration, hospitalized within one recent year due to 
COPD acute exacerbation, and without vaccination of 23 voluntary pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine within 3 years. A quasi-experimental design without 
control group was adopted. Objects were vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine from January to December in 2013, then were followed up 
from January in 2014 for one year. Data of effectiveness and medical cost was 
collected by self-designed questionnaire and <EuroQol five dimensions 
questionnaire >(Chinese version). Paired rank sum test applied to test the 
difference of quality of life, number and direct medical cost of treatment 
(including outpatient treatment and hospitalization) due to COPD acute 
exacerbation, one year before and after intervention. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and cost-benefit ratio (CBR) of the programme 
were calculated. Results: By January 2014, eight hundred sixty objects were 
vaccinated. By January 2015, seven hundred eighty eight objects were followed 
up, with 72 cases withdrawed (8.4%). On average, COPD patients reduced 1.12±2.51 
treatments due to acute exacerbation, including 0.28±2.09 outpatient treatments 
and 0.85±1.15 hospitalizations. Total medical cost was saved by 3 610.21 per 
capita yuan, including outpatient cost of 241.41 yuan and hospitalization cost 
of 269.82 yuan; Quality of life was gained by 0.03 QALY gain per capita. The 
ICER was dominant and CBR was 12.00. Conclusion: COPD patients vaccinated with 
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine within one year reduced treatments 
due to acute exacerbation. The vaccination was cost effective and cost saving , 
and we suggest the vaccine should be covered in the public health program or 
health insurance scheme in conditional region.

Objective: To understand the life expectancy (LE) and health life expectancy 
(HALE) of Chinese during 1990-2015. Methods: Using the results of global burden 
of disease study 2015 (GBD 2015), we compared the Chinese LE and HALE in 2015 
with those of other countries and analyzed the differences between LE and HALE 
in Chinese and the changes of LE and HALE during 1990-2015 at both national 
level and provincial level. Results: In 2015, the LE and the HALE of Chinese 
were 76.2 and 68.0 years, 4.4 and 5.2 years higher than the global averages, 
respectively. The LE and HALE were higher in women than in men. The high LE and 
HALE were observed in developed provinces or areas, such as Shanghai, Beijing, 
Hong Kong, Macau, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Tianjin and Guangdong, while the low LE and 
HALE were found in underdeveloped provinces, such as Tibet, Qinghai, Guizhou, 
Xinjiang and Yunnan. Between 1990 and 2015, the LE and HALE of Chinese increased 
substantially by 9.5 and 8.4 years, respectively. The increase of LE was greater 
than that of HALE at both national level and provincial level. Conclusion: LE 
and HALE of Chinese increased substantially from 1990 to 2015, but the 
differences among provinces were obvious.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that 
affects upper and/or lower motor neurons. It usually affects people between the 
ages of 40-70. The average life expectancy is about 3-5 years after diagnosis 
and there is no effective cure available. Identification of variants in more 
than 20 different loci has provided insight into the pathogenic molecular 
mechanisms mediating disease pathogenesis. In this review, we focus on seven 
ALS-causing genes: TDP-43, FUS, C9orf72, VCP, UBQLN2, VAPB and SOD-1, which 
encompass about 90% of the variants causing familial ALS. We examine the 
biological functions of these genes to assess how these pathogenic variants 
contribute to ALS pathogenesis by integrating findings from studies in 
Drosophila melanogaster and mammals. Additionally, we highlight the functional 
and genetic connections between these loci. Altogether, this review reveals that 
the majority of biological studies converge on defects in proteostasis due to 
the mislocalization of TDP-43 and/or altering the function of specific proteins 
mediating or modulating proteasomal degradation.
