Photoperiod is an important factor influencing many biological processes 
including population dynamics of many insect species in temperate zones. To 
determine the population response of Chrysoperla nipponensis under altered 
conditions (high temperature and short photoperiod) and to test whether the 
short photoperiod was suitable for artificial storage, the life table data of 
were collected at 25 °C under a long photoperiod, 15:9 h (L:D), and a short 
photoperiod, 9:15 h (L:D) and analyzed using the age-stage, two-sex life table 
approach. We found that developed faster under long photoperiod than under the 
short photoperiod. The shorter developmental time, higher fecundity, and higher 
proportion of females found during the long photoperiod resulted in higher 
intrinsic and net reproductive rates, but a shorter mean generation time and 
life expectancy compared to those reared during the short photoperiod. 
Individuals reared under the short photoperiod also had a high reproductive 
value. Population projection demonstrated that reared at long photoperiod would 
complete four generations in 150 d, while reared under short photoperiod would 
just be entering the second generation. Our results demonstrated that the 
different fitness values obtained for individuals by varying photoperiod 
lengths, were readily distinguishable when using the age-stage, two-sex life 
table.

Does the pattern of occupational class inequalities in self-reported health 
depend on the choice of survey? A comparative analysis of four surveys and 35 
European countries.

Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

BACKGROUND: Despite increasing overall life expectancy, substantial differences 
in health between socioeconomic groups persist. Research on inequalities in 
health often draws on data from different, single surveys. An important question 
that arises is whether these surveys reflect health and inequalities in the same 
way. When occupational class is utilized, data are often not analysed for women. 
The aim of this study therefore is to investigate whether patterns of 
occupational class inequalities in self-reported health differ across sex and 
country, between four major European surveys.
METHODS: Data on self-reported health and occupational class are taken from the 
European Social Survey (ESS), the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions 
(EU-SILC), the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) and the International 
Social Survey Programme (ISSP). Data from 35 countries for men and women aged 
25–65 years are analysed. Occupational class is measured according to manual and 
non-manual workers. Age-standardized prevalence rates, and prevalence ratios 
(PR) between non-manual and manual workers and likelihood ratio (LR) tests are 
estimated to determine occupational class inequalities in self-rated health in 
Europe.
RESULTS: Results show that prevalence rates of less than good health differ 
noticeably between countries and surveys. Furthermore, occupational class 
inequalities in health differ between countries. In some countries inequalities 
are larger for women than for men. This is especially true in Eastern, Central 
and Baltic European countries. Besides that no regional patterns, consistent 
over all surveys, in inequalities could be detected. Inequalities differed 
significantly between surveys.
CONCLUSION: The magnitude of inequalities in all countries depend on the survey 
used in the analysis. When undertaking a comparative analysis of inequalities in 
health, or other determinants, these differences have to be taken into account, 
as results might differ according to the data source used.

BACKGROUND: Decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) is a life-saving procedure for 
treatment of large malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes. Post-stroke 
epilepsy is an additional burden for these patients, but its incidence and the 
risk factors for its development have been poorly investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence and risk factors for post-stroke seizures 
and post-stroke epilepsy after DHC for treatment of large malignant MCA strokes 
in a cohort of 36 patients.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of 36 patients we report the timing and 
incidence of post-stroke epilepsy. We analyzed if age, sex, vascular risk 
factors, side of ischemia, reperfusion therapy, stroke etiology, extension of 
stroke, hemorrhagic transformation, ECASS scores, National Institutes of Health 
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, or modified Rankin scores were risk factors for 
seizure or epilepsy after DHC for treatment of large MCA strokes.
RESULTS: The mean patient follow-up time was 1,086 days (SD = 1,172). Out of 36 
patients, 9 (25.0%) died before being discharged. After 1 year, a total of 11 
patients (30.6%) had died, but 22 (61.1%) of them had a modified Rankin score 
≤4. Thirteen patients (36.1%) developed seizures within the first week after 
stroke. Seizures occurred in 22 (61.1%) of 36 patients (95% CI = 45.17-77.03%). 
Out of 34 patients who survived the acute period, 19 (55.9%) developed epilepsy 
after MCA infarcts and DHC (95% CI = 39.21-72.59%). In this study, no 
significant differences were observed between the patients who developed 
seizures or epilepsy and those who remained free of seizures or epilepsy 
regarding age, sex, side of stroke, presence of the clinical risk factors 
studied, hemorrhagic transformation, time of craniectomy, and Rankin score after 
1 year of stroke.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of seizures and epilepsy after malignant MCA infarcts 
submitted to DHC might be very high. Seizure might occur precociously in 
patients who are not submitted to anticonvulsant prophylaxis. The large stroke 
volume and the large cortical ischemic area seem to be the main risk factors for 
seizure or epilepsy development in this subtype of stroke. .

OBJECTIVES: India has proclaimed commitment to the goal of Universal Health 
Coverage and Delhi, the National Capital Territory, has increased investment in 
public health and other health services over the past decade. The research 
investigates whether Delhi's increased investment in health over this period is 
associated with a reduction in premature deaths, after the age of 1 year, which 
could have been avoided with better access to effective health care 
interventions (amenable mortality).
STUDY DESIGN: A population-based study of changes in amenable mortality (AM) in 
Delhi over the 2003-2013 period.
METHODS: To calculate AM, a list of International Classification of Disease 
(ICD) codes from the published literature was relied upon. In defining AM in 
India, an upper age limit of 69 years was adopted, rather than the more common 
limit of 74 years. Population estimates and vital statistics were downloaded 
from the Delhi Statistical Handbook. Deaths by cause and age, including medical 
certification, are from the Vital Statistics site of the Delhi Government. To 
age-adjust these data, the direct method was employed, using weights derived 
from the 2010 United Nations world standard population.
RESULTS: The research found that, between 2004 and 2013, the age-adjusted rate 
of AM rose from 0.87 to 1.09. The leading causes of death in both years were 
septicemia and tuberculosis. Maternal mortality is well above the global level 
for middle-income countries.
CONCLUSION: Recent investments in public health and health care and the capacity 
to leverage them to improve access to effective care have not been sufficient to 
overcome the crushing poverty and inequalities within Delhi. Large and growing 
numbers of residents die prematurely each year due to causes that are amenable 
to public health and health care interventions.

BACKGROUND: The impact of prosthetic choices in patients with severe chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) on long-term outcomes has not been well established.
METHODS: The study involved 152 adult patients (61.6±14.1yrs.; 64 females) 
undergoing heart valve surgery who had stage 4 (n=87) or 5 CKD (end-stage; n=65) 
based on Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Guidelines. To reduce the 
impact of selection bias between mechanical (n=92) and bio-prostheses groups 
(n=60), propensity score analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing bioprosthetic replacement were significantly older 
and had poorer left ventricular function compared with those undergoing 
mechanical valve replacements. Early mortality rates were 10.0% in the 
Bio-prostheses group and 9.8% in the Mechanical group (P>0.99). During a median 
duration of 22.1months (Quartile 1-3, 4.7-68.1months; 87.5% complete), 56 
patients died and 12 patients experienced valve-related complications. The 
unadjusted outcomes showed no significant differences in survival (P=0.23) and 
freedom from valve-related events (P=0.17). After adjustment, there was no 
significant difference in survival (Hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.62-1.71; P=0.91), however the bio-prostheses group showed 
significant superior outcomes of freedom from valve-related event (HR, 4.49; 95% 
CI, 1.04-19.45; P=0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: Valve replacement in CKD patients showed very high mortality risks 
and limited life expectancy even in younger individuals. When compared with 
bioprosthetic replacement, mechanical valve replacement showed similar survival 
rate but with greater risks of developing major valve-related complications in 
these patients. Therefore, bioprosthetic replacement may be a more reasonable 
option over mechanical replacement in these high-risk patients.

INTRODUCTION: Binge-eating disorder (BED) was included as its own diagnostic 
entity in the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM-5). An increasing number of treatment studies have been 
published, but an up-to-date comprehensive meta-analysis on diverse treatment 
approaches for BED is lacking. In an updated and extension of a previous 
meta-analysis, the goals of this study are to assess the short-term and 
long-term effectiveness of psychological and medical treatments for BED.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search bibliographic databases and study 
registries, including manual searches for studies published before January 2016. 
The search strategy will include terms relating to binge eating and diverse 
forms of psychological and medical interventions. Language will be restricted to 
English. The studies included will be treatment studies, that is, 
randomised-controlled trials, and non-randomised and non-controlled studies, for 
individuals with BED (DSM-IV or DSM-5), and studies that provided a 
pre-treatment and at least one post-treatment or follow-up assessment of binge 
eating. The primary outcomes will be the number of binge-eating episodes, 
abstinence from binge eating and diagnosis of BED at post-treatment and/or 
follow-up(s), and changes from pre-treatment to post-treatment and/or 
follow-up(s). Likewise, as secondary outcomes, eating disorder and general 
psychopathology, quality of life, and body weight will be analysed and adverse 
events and treatment drop-out will be examined. Study search, selection and data 
extraction, including risk of bias assessment, will be independently performed 
by 2 reviewers and consensus will be sought. Moderator analyses will be 
conducted, and equity aspects will be considered. Sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted to determine the robustness of the results.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this 
meta-analysis. Published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated 
electronically and in print, this meta-analysis will form the basis of the 
renewal of the German evidence-based S3 Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment of 
Eating Disorders, specifically BED.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may slow the 
progression of subcortical ischaemic vascular cognitive impairment (SIVCI) by 
modifying cardiovascular risk factors. Yet the economic consequences relating to 
aerobic training (AT) remain unknown. Therefore, our primary objective was to 
estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained of 
a thrice weekly AT intervention compared with usual care.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis alongside a randomised trial.
SETTING: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: 70 adults (mean age of 74 years, 51% women) who meet the 
diagnostic criteria for mild SIVCI.
INTERVENTION: A 6-month, thrice weekly, progressive aerobic exercise training 
programme compared with usual care (CON; comparator) with a follow-up assessment 
6 months after formal cessation of aerobic exercise training.
MEASUREMENTS: Healthcare resource usage was estimated over the 6-month 
intervention and 6-month follow-up period. Health status (using the EQ-5D-3L) at 
baseline and trial completion and 6-month follow-up was used to calculate QALYs. 
The incremental cost-utility ratio (cost per QALY gained) was calculated.
RESULTS: QALYs were both modestly greater, indicating a health gain. Total 
healthcare costs (ie, 1791±1369 {2015 $CAD} at 6 months) were greater, 
indicating a greater cost for the thrice weekly AT group compared with CON. From 
the Canadian healthcare system perspective, the incremental cost-utility ratios 
for thrice weekly AT were cost-effective compared with CON, when using a 
willingness to pay threshold of $CAD 20 000 per QALY gained or higher.
CONCLUSIONS: AT represents an attractive and potentially cost-effective strategy 
for older adults with mild SIVCI.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) denotes an advanced malignant disease process. 
Most of the MPE are metastatic involvement of the pleura from primary malignancy 
at lung, breast, and other body sites apart from lymphomas. The diagnosis of MPE 
has been traditionally made on cytological examination of pleural fluid and/or 
histological examination of pleural biopsy tissue that still remains the initial 
approach in these cases. There has been tremendous advancement in the diagnosis 
of MPE now a day with techniques i.e. characteristic Ultrasound and computed 
tomography features, image guided biopsies, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography imaging, thoracoscopy with direct biopsy under vision, tumor marker 
studies and immunocytochemical analysis etc., that have made possible an early 
diagnosis of MPE. The management of MPE still remains a challenge to 
pulmonologist and oncologist. Despite having various modalities with better 
tolerance such as pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheters etc., for 
long-term control, all the management approaches remain palliative to improve 
the quality of life and reduce symptoms. While choosing an appropriate 
management intervention, one should consider the clinical status of the patient, 
life expectancy, overall cost, availability and comparative institutional 
outcomes, etc.

PURPOSE: The present study aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of concomitant 
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment in low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (LDASA) 
users at risk of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) adverse effects as compared with 
no PPI co-medication with attention to the age-dependent influence of 
PPI-induced adverse effects.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to compare the strategy of PPI co-medication 
with no PPI co-medication in older LDASA users at risk of UGI adverse effects. 
As PPIs reduce the risk of UGI bleeding and dyspepsia, these risk factors were 
modelled together with PPI adverse effects for LDASA users 60-69, 70-79 (base 
case) and 80 years and older. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were 
calculated as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained per age 
category. Furthermore, a budget impact analysis assessed the expected changes in 
expenditure of the Dutch healthcare system following the adoption of PPI 
co-treatment in all LDASA users potentially at risk of UGI adverse effects.
RESULTS: PPI co-treatment of 70- to 79-year-old LDASA users, as compared with no 
PPI, resulted in incremental costs of €100.51 at incremental effects of 0.007 
QALYs with an ICUR of €14,671/QALY. ICURs for 60- to 69-year-old LDASA users 
were €13,264/QALY and €64,121/QALY for patients 80 years and older. Initiation 
of PPI co-treatment for all Dutch LDASA users of 60 years and older at risk of 
UGI adverse effects but not prescribed a PPI (19%) would have cost €1,280,478 in 
the first year (year 2013 values).
CONCLUSIONS: PPI co-medication in LDASA users at risk of UGI adverse effects is 
generally cost effective. However, this strategy becomes less cost effective 
with higher age, particularly in patients aged 80 years and older, mainly due to 
the increased risks of PPI-induced adverse effects.

BACKGROUND: No study has compared the cost-effectiveness of active treatment 
options for unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours in 
patients who progressed on or are intolerant to prior treatment with imatinib 
and sunitinib. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
regorafenib compared to imatinib rechallenge in this setting in Germany.
METHODS: Hazard ratios for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with 
regorafenib versus imatinib rechallenge were estimated by indirect comparison. A 
state distribution model was used to simulate progression, mortality and 
treatment costs over a lifetime horizon. Drug acquisition costs and utilities 
were derived from clinical trial data and published literature; non-drug costs 
were not included. The outcomes measured were treatment costs, life-years (LYs) 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The indirect comparison suggested that median PFS and OS were longer 
with regorafenib compared to imatinib but results were not statistically 
significant. Regorafenib versus imatinib rechallenge was estimated to have 
hazard ratios of 0.58 (95% CI 0.31-1.11) for PFS and 0.77 (95% CI 0.34-1.77) for 
OS, with substantial uncertainty due to the rarity of the disease and small 
number of patients within the trials. Regorafenib treatment per patient over a 
lifetime horizon provided an additional 0.61 LYs and 0.42 QALYs over imatinib 
rechallenge, with additional direct drug costs of €8,773. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was €21,127 per QALY gained. At a cost-effectiveness 
threshold of €50,000 per QALY, regorafenib had a 67% probability of being 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Based on the currently available clinical data, this analysis 
suggests that regorafenib is cost-effective compared with imatinib rechallenge 
in Germany.

INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy, couples with at least one partner 
afflicted with HIV are more commonly pursuing the opportunity to have biologic 
offspring. Currently, there are no universally accepted recommendations 
regarding first line reproductive treatments for HIV serodiscordant couples 
lacking a history of infertility. We strongly believe that fertility care 
intervention should be the first line treatment, when affordably accessible, 
over natural conception for HIV serodiscordant couples to achieve pregnancy in a 
safe and efficacious manner.
DISCUSSION: In the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, in combination 
with timed intercourse and pre-exposure prophylaxis for the HIV negative 
partner, some members of the medical community are arguing in favour of natural 
conception as a means of achieving pregnancy in this patient population. In our 
opinion, laboratory assisted fertility methods, including intrauterine 
insemination, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection with 
semen washing should be the first line treatment recommendation for HIV 
serodiscordant couples desiring pregnancy for the following reasons: (1) 
abundance of evidence in the medical literature supporting the safety profile 
and efficacy of fertility care intervention in couples with HIV; paucity of data 
addressing safety of natural conception in comparison to fertility intervention 
techniques (2) unknown public health impact of promoting natural conception as a 
safe means of achieving pregnancy (3) ethical implications: patients should be 
offered the available and accessible treatment option posing the lowest possible 
known risk to the uninfected partner.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that physician assisted fertility care, when affordably 
accessible, should be the treatment of choice over natural conception. While the 
preliminary data on natural conception in couples using highly active 
anti-retroviral therapy/pre-exposure prophylaxis/timed intercourse appears 
promising, we believe that this approach should be limited to patients in 
resource poor settings where more sophisticated measures do not exist or for 
patients that simply cannot afford subspecialty care. There are likely to be 
unknown psychological and behavioural factors impacted by promoting natural 
conception and diminishing the importance of safe sex practices. Additionally, 
it is our moral obligation to patients to offer the affordably accessible 
treatment interventions that pose the least known risk when considering 
reproductive options.

Obesity is a major public health issue, with a prevalence of 4 to 28% for men 
and 6.2 to 36.5% for women in Europe (from 2003 to 2008). Morbid obesity is 
frequently associated with metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, and dyslipidemia, reducing life expectancy and quality. In the 
absence of any effective noninvasive treatments, bariatric surgery is a valuable 
therapeutic option for patients with morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) >40 
kg/m2), leading to long-term, sustained weight loss and improvements in 
metabolic complications. However, the underlying cellular and molecular 
mechanisms sustaining the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery are not yet 
fully understood. Due to the numerous genetically-modified strains available, 
the mouse model is the most convenient animal model to explore the molecular 
mechanisms behind the pleiotropic beneficial effects of bariatric surgeries. 
Here, we detailed the optimized healthcare methods and surgical protocols in 
mice for the two most widely-used bariatric surgeries: the sleeve gastrectomy 
and the modified Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the therapeutic effects of bariatric surgeries offers the promise of 
identifying new therapeutics targets.

Aptamers are an attractive molecular medicine that offers high target 
specificity. Nucleic acid-based aptamers, however, are prone to nuclease 
degradation and rapid renal excretion that require blood circulatory half-life 
extension enabling technologies. The long circulatory half-life, predominately 
facilitated by engagement with the cellular recycling neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn), and ligand transport properties of albumin promote it as an attractive 
candidate to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of aptamers. This study 
investigates the effect of Cys34 site-selective covalent attachment of a factor 
IXa anticoagulant aptamer on aptamer functionality and human FcRn (hFcRn) 
engagement using recombinant human albumin (rHA) of either a wild type (WT) or 
an engineered human FcRn high binding variant (HB). Albumin-aptamer conjugates, 
connected covalently through a heterobifunctional succinimidyl 
4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate linker, were successfully 
prepared and purified by high performance liquid chromatography as confirmed by 
gel electrophoresis band-shift analysis and matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time of flight. Minimal reduction (∼25%) in activity of 
WT-linked aptamer to that of aptamer alone was found using an anticoagulant 
activity assay measuring temporal levels of activated partial thrombin. Covalent 
albumin-aptamer conjugation, however, substantially compromized binding to 
hFcRn, to 10% affinity of that of non-conjugated WT, determined by biolayer 
interferometry. Binding could be rescued by aptamer conjugation to recombinant 
albumin engineered for higher FcRn affinity (HB) that exhibited an 8-fold 
affinity compared to WT alone. This work describes a novel albumin-based aptamer 
delivery system whose hFcRn binding can be increased using a HB engineered 
albumin.

BACKGROUND: New cancer biomarkers are being discovered at a rapid pace; however, 
these tests vary in their predictive performance characteristics, and it is 
unclear how best to use them.
METHODS: We investigated 2-stage biomarker-based screening strategies in the 
context of prostate cancer using a partially observable Markov model to simulate 
patients' progression through prostate cancer states to mortality from prostate 
cancer or other causes. Patients were screened every 2 years from ages 55 to 69. 
If the patient's serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was over a specified 
threshold in the first stage, a second stage biomarker test was administered. We 
evaluated design characteristics for these 2-stage strategies using 7 newly 
discovered biomarkers as examples. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate 
the number of screening biopsies, prostate cancer deaths, and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) per 1000 men.
RESULTS: The all-cancer biomarkers significantly underperformed the high-grade 
cancer biomarkers in terms of QALYs. The screening strategy that used a PSA 
threshold of 2 ng/mL and a second biomarker test with high-grade sensitivity and 
specificity of 0.86 and 0.62, respectively, maximized QALYs. This strategy 
resulted in a prostate cancer death rate within 1% of using PSA alone with a 
threshold of 2 ng/mL, while reducing the number of biopsies by 20%. Sensitivity 
analysis suggests that the results are robust with respect to variation in model 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-stage biomarker screening strategies using new biomarkers with 
risk thresholds optimized for high-grade cancer detection may increase 
quality-adjusted survival and reduce unnecessary biopsies.

PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) in the diagnosis 
and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan compared with 
extracellular contrast media-enhanced MRI (ECCM-MRI) and contrast media-enhanced 
computed tomography (CE-CT) scanning.
METHODS: A 6-stage Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime direct costs 
and clinical outcomes associated with EOB-MRI. Diagnostic sensitivity and 
specificity, along with clinical data on HCC survival, recurrence, treatment 
patterns, costs, and health state utility values, were derived from 
predominantly Japanese publications. Parameters unavailable from publications 
were estimated in a Delphi panel of Japanese clinical experts who also confirmed 
the structure and overall approach of the model. Sensitivity analyses, including 
one-way, probabilistic, and scenario analyses, were conducted to account for 
uncertainty in the results.
FINDINGS: Over a lifetime horizon, EOB-MRI was associated with lower direct 
costs (¥2,174,869) and generated a greater number of quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) (9.502) than either ECCM-MRI (¥2,365,421, 9.303 QALYs) or CE-CT 
(¥2,482,608, 9.215 QALYs). EOB-MRI was superior to the other diagnostic 
strategies considered, and this finding was robust over sensitivity and scenario 
analyses. A majority of the direct costs associated with HCC in Japan were found 
to be costs of treatment. The model results revealed the superior 
cost-effectiveness of the EOB-MRI diagnostic strategy compared with ECCM-MRI and 
CE-CT.
IMPLICATIONS: EOB-MRI could be the first-choice imaging modality for medical 
care of HCC among patients with hepatitis or liver cirrhosis in Japan. 
Widespread implementation of EOB-MRI could reduce health care expenditures, 
particularly downstream treatment costs, associated with HCC.

Chitinase is used to degrade chitin in insect cuticles and the peritrophic 
matrix. In this study, the full-length cDNA sequence of a Cht gene (SfCht7) was 
identified and characterized from the white-black planthopper, Sogatella 
furcifera. The SfCht7 cDNA was 3148bp, contained an open reading frame of 2877bp 
and encoded 958 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 107.9kDa. 
Homology analysis indicated that SfCht7 has typical chitinase features include a 
chitin-binding domain, two catalytic domains and a signal peptide region. 
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that SfCht7 belonged to the group III 
chitinases. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that SfCht7 was highly 
expressed before molting. After injecting SfCht7 double-stranded RNA in the 
nymph stage, insects exhibited phenotypes of difficulty in molting and wing 
development. A lethal phenotype was that nymph bodies exuviated from the head 
but the old cuticle did not detach completely from the body. Another lethal 
phenotype was that elongated distal wing pads of fifth-instar nymphs with 
junctions between the thorax and abdomen in the treatment group that were 
thinner than in the control group, giving a "wasp-waisted" appearance. In 
another phenotype that was not lethal, nymphs exuviated and old cuticles 
detached completely from the body, but the wings of adults did not stretch 
normally.

OBJECTIVE: To examine long-term retention rate, clinical outcomes, cost-utility 
and cost-effectiveness of the Ketogenic Diet (KD) compared with care as usual 
(CAU) in children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy from a societal 
perspective.
METHODS: Participants were randomized into a KD or CAU group. Seizure frequency, 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs), side-effects, seizure severity, health care 
costs, production losses, patient and family costs were assessed at baseline and 
during 16-months of follow-up. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
(i.e. cost per QALY and cost per responder) and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves are presented.
RESULTS: 48 children were included in the analyses of this study (26 from KD 
group). In total, 58% of the KD group completed the follow-up of 16 months; 11 
dropped-out for various reasons. At 16 months, 35% of the KD participants had a 
seizure reduction≥50% from baseline, compared with 18% of the CAU participants. 
Mean costs per patient in the CAU group were €53,367 (extrapolated) compared to 
€61,019 per patient in the KD group, resulting in an ICER of €46,564 per 
responder. Cost per QALY rose well above any acceptable ceiling ratio. At 
4-months' follow-up, the KD group showed significantly more gastro-intestinal 
problems compared to the CAU group. At 16 months, the KD group reported fewer 
problems compared to CAU. Furthermore, 46.2% of the KD group reported a decrease 
in severity of their worst seizure compared to 32% of the CAU group.
CONCLUSION: The KD group resulted in more responders and showed greater 
improvement on seizure severity. Furthermore, the KD did not lead to worsening 
of side-effects other than gastro-intestinal problems (only at 4 months' 
follow-up). However, as only a minimal difference in QALYs was found between the 
KD group and the CAU group, the resulting cost per QALY ratios were 
inconclusive.

Stroke affects both men and women of all ages, although the condition is more 
common among the elderly. Stroke occurs at an older age among women than among 
men; although the incidence is lower among women than among men, as women have a 
longer life expectancy their lifetime risk is slightly higher. Ischemic stroke 
is the most common type of stroke; and reperfusion treatment is possible if the 
patient reaches hospital early enough. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are 
time-sensitive treatments - the earlier they are initiated the better is the 
chance of a positive outcome. It is therefore important to identify a stroke as 
soon as possible. Medical personnel can readily identify typical stroke symptoms 
but the presentation of non-traditional stroke symptoms, such as impaired 
consciousness and altered mental status, is often associated with a significant 
delay in the identification of stroke and thus delay in or inability to provide 
treatment. Non-traditional stroke symptoms are reported to be more common in 
women, who are thereby at risk of delayed recognition of stroke and treatment 
delay.
