METHODS: Our sample included respondents ages 25-66 to the 1979-2015 PSID with 
mortality follow-up through age 68 and year 2017. To address healthy-worker 
bias, we used the parametric g-formula. First, we estimated how a scenario 
setting all (versus none) of respondents' employed-person-years to union-member 
employed-person-years would have affected mortality incidence. Next, we examined 
gender, racial, and educational effect modification. Finally, we estimated how 
racial and educational mortality inequities would have changed if 
union-membership prevalence had remained at 1979 (vs. 2015) levels throughout 
follow-up.
RESULTS: In the full sample (respondents = 23,022, observations = 146,681), the 
union scenario was associated with lower mortality incidence than the nonunion 
scenario (RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.80, 0.99; RD per 1,000 = -19, 95% CI = -37, -1). 
This protective association generally held across subgroups, although it was 
stronger among the more-educated. However, we found little evidence mortality 
inequities would have lessened if union membership had remained at 1979 levels.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this was the first individual-level US-based 
study with repeated union-membership measurements to analyze the union-mortality 
relationship. We estimated a protective union-mortality association, but found 
little evidence declining union density has exacerbated mortality inequities; 
importantly, we did not incorporate contextual-level effects. See video abstract

    Epidemiology. 2020 Sep;31(5):745-754.

Previous research based on the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 
has argued that the prevalence of cognitive impairment has declined in recent 
years in the United States. A recent article published in Epidemiology by Hale 
et al., however, suggests this finding is biased by unmeasured panel 
conditioning (improvement in cognitive scores resulting from repeat assessment). 
After adjusting for test number, Hale and colleagues found that the prevalence 
of cognitive impairment had actually increased between 1996 and 2014. In this 
commentary, we argue that simply adjusting for test number is not an appropriate 
way to handle panel conditioning in this instance because it fails to account 
for selective attrition (the tendency for cognitively high-functioning 
respondents to remain in the sample for a longer time). We reanalyze HRS data 
using models that simultaneously adjust for panel conditioning and selective 
attrition. Contrary to Hale et al., we find that the prevalence of cognitive 
impairment has indeed declined in the United States in recent decades.

York, New York, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have a life expectancy that is 
nearly equivalent to the general population, and thus are facing health 
conditions associated with normal aging as well as long-term HIV infection. 
End-organ disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and 
solid organ transplantation (SOT) may be a viable option for many PLWH. We 
review the history and recent updates in SOT in PLWH, specifically focusing on 
HIV-to-HIV transplantation.
RECENT FINDINGS: Following promising data out of South Africa and to expand the 
donor pool, the United States passed the HIV Organ Procurement Equity (HOPE) 
Act, allowing for HIV-to-HIV SOT. Preliminary data to date, especially in 
HIV-to-HIV kidney transplantation, suggest overall excellent patient and graft 
survival outcomes with no HIV breakthrough infection.
SUMMARY: Preliminary HIV D+R+ SOT data to date suggest promising patient 
outcomes and no significant adverse events to recipients or living donors. This 
is an important step in expanding the donor pool and increasing opportunity for 
SOT in PLWH.

Seismic international events, such as world wars and pandemics, have a global 
impact on healthcare that continues well beyond the duration of the event. 
Following the Spanish flu in 1918-1919 there was a baby boom, life expectancy 
increased, and socialized healthcare systems began to be established. In 1948, 
following the second world war, the NHS was established. The changes to 
healthcare that we will see following the Covid-19 pandemic will become apparent 
over the next few years but it is clear that models of care have already changed 
significantly and are unlikely to return to previous established pathways. In 
particular, remote care delivery has become established as a viable choice for 
people living with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Patients with refractory angina (RA) have poor quality of life and 
new therapies are needed. XC001 is a novel adenoviral vector expressing multiple 
isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoting an enhanced 
local angiogenic effect.
METHODS: The Epicardial Delivery of XC001 Gene Therapy for Refractory Angina 
Coronary Treatment (EXACT) trial is a 6-month (with 6-month extension) phase 
1/2, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of XC001 in 
patients with RA. The trial will enroll 33 patients in an initial (n = 12) 
ascending dose-escalation phase (1 × 109, 1 × 1010, 4 × 1010, and 1 × 1011 viral 
particles), followed by phase 2 (n = 21) assessing the highest tolerated dose. 
Patients must have stable Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class II-IV 
angina on maximally tolerated medical therapy without options for conventional 
revascularization, demonstrable ischemia on stress testing, and angina limiting 
exercise tolerance. XC001 will be delivered directly to ischemic myocardium via 
surgical transthoracic epicardial access. The primary outcome is safety via 
adverse event monitoring through 6 months. Efficacy assessments include 
difference from baseline to month 6 in time to 1 mm of ST segment depression, 
time to angina, and total exercise duration; myocardial blood flow at rest, and 
stress and coronary flow reserve by positron emission tomography; quality of 
life; CCS functional class; and angina frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: The EXACT trial will determine whether direct intramyocardial 
administration of XC001 in patients with RA is safe and evaluate its effect on 
exercise tolerance, myocardial perfusion, angina and physical activity, 
informing future clinical investigation.

The objective of this study was to analyze the efficiency of the killed vaccine 
against nervous necrosis virus on Acipenser stellutus. Heat inactivated VNN 
vaccine was administrated in 7 g juveniles of Acipenser stellutus as a 
laboratory model and it was included in three different adjuvants that were used 
as injection and immersion forms with different doses. Ten groups consisting of 
30 A. stellutus fish in each group (group 1-4 with 3 replications, others with 
no replicate) were divided totally into 18 aquariums. Two steps of vaccination 
were done with a one-month interval and after that, all treatments and control 
groups were challenged by the virulent VNN virus. The mortality rate of 
immersion and injection groups were 12.9% and 19.8% respectively, compared to 
100% mortality in the control group. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry 
findings were evaluated. According to the mortality rate one month after 
challenging, a low range mortality of 12.5% was seen in group 2 with no 
pathological lesion and negative IHC test in the brain and eye tissues, whereas 
100% of the control group (unvaccinated group) died with severe vacuolation in 
the brain and eye tissues and also positive IHC test. The correlation assay 
between these results concluded that the immersion form with 75% of 
aquatic-specific Montanide IMS 1312 Seppic adjuvant made better immunization 
with no pathological sign or forming the complex of antigen-antibody in IHC 
assay. These findings are important because of the impossibility of injection in 
the larval stage and also due to the occurrence of the disease in the first 
stage of sturgeon life which could cause high mortality in susceptible fish in 
the larval stage.

Retinoblastoma: A Major Review.

Complex, Bangladesh; E-mail: dr.somaroy2020@gmail.com.

Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor with an incidence of 
1: 16,000 to 18,000 live birth and represents 11% of cancer that develop in the 
first year of life. Retinoblastoma may be unilateral (60%) or bilateral (40%). 
Bilateral cases always heritable and median age of diagnosis is 1 year. 
Unilateral cases are mostly non heritable but 15% can be heritable and median 
age of presentation is 2 years. All children with heritable form carry mutation 
in RB1 gene. Though most frequent symptoms during diagnosis are leucocoria and 
strabismus, can present as most severe form in under developed countries. 
Diagnosis is made by fundus examination. Ultrasonography and imaging (CT, MRI) 
contribute both in diagnosis and assessment of extension of diseases. The aim of 
treatment is to save the child first, followed by globe and vision salvage. 
Treatment depends on laterality, size, location and extent of tumor. The main 
prognosis depends on early detection of tumor and treating the child by 
multidisciplinary team approach. Due to advancement in treatment modalities for 
the last two decade the survival rate of retinoblastoma has increased. But long 
term follow up is mandatory for retinoblastoma survivor as there is risk for 
development of second cancers in later life. Proper genetic screening and 
genetic counseling can help parents and patients in their adulthood to 
understand the disease properly.

This study explores potential associations between the methylation of 
promoter-associated CpG sites of the toll-like receptor (TLR)-family, plasma 
levels of pro-inflammatory proteins and depressive symptoms in young female 
psychiatric patients. Ratings of depressive symptoms and blood samples were 
obtained from 92 young women seeking psychiatric care. Methylation of 32 
promoter-associated CpG sites in TLR1 to TLR10 was analysed using the Illumina 
Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Expression levels of 91 inflammatory 
proteins were determined by proximity extension assay. Statistical correlations 
between depressive state, TLR1-10 methylation and inflammatory proteins were 
investigated. Four additional cohorts were studied to evaluate the 
generalizability of the findings. In the discovery cohort, methylation grade of 
cg05429895 (TLR4) in blood was inversely correlated with depressive symptoms 
score in young adults. After correction for multiple testing, plasma levels of 
macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (MIP-1β/CCL4) were associated with both TLR4 
methylation and depressive symptom severity. A similar inverse association 
between TLR4 methylation in blood and affective symptoms score was also found in 
a cohort of 148 both males and females (<40 years of age) from the Danish Twin 
Registry. These findings were not, however, replicated in three other external 
cohorts; which differed from the first two cohorts by a higher age and mixed 
ethnicities, thus limiting the generalizability of our findings. However, TLR4 
methylation inversely correlated with TLR4 mRNA expression in the Danish Twin 
Study indicating a functional significance of methylation at this particular 
CpG. Higher depression scores in young Scandinavian adults was associated with 
decreased methylation of TLR4 in blood.

BACKGROUND: The Parkinson's disease (PD) patient population, with an already 
reduced life expectancy, is rendered particularly vulnerable by the Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
OBJECTIVES: We determined the risk factors that increase the risk of death in 
patients with Parkinson's disease who are infected by SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of PD admitted to Montefiore Hospital (Bronx, 
New York) and tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Retrospective review of 
electronic medical records confirmed the diagnosis; patients were classified by 
severity of PD. PD severity, demographic, socioeconomic factors, and 
co-morbidities were correlated with mortality rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: We identified 162 patients meeting criteria; chart review confirmed a 
diagnosis of PD in 70 patients. Of the 70 patients, 53 were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 and 17 were negative. PD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a 
higher mortality rate (35.8%) compared to PD patients without the infection 
(5.9%, P = 0.028). PD patients older than 70 years of age, those with advanced 
Parkinson's disease, those with reductions in their medications, and 
non-Hispanics (largely comprised of Black/African- Americans) had a 
statistically significant higher mortality rate, if infected.
CONCLUSIONS: PD did not increase mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection when 
age was controlled. However, certain unalterable factors (advanced disease and 
age greater than 70 years) and alterable ones (reductions in PD medications) 
placed PD patients at increased risk for mortality. Also several socioeconomic 
factors contributed to mortality, for example, non-Hispanic patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection fared worse, likely driven by poorer outcomes in the 
Black/African-American cohort.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of persistent organic 
pollutants (POPs) used as flame retardants in the products utilized in 
day-to-day life. Their bioaccumulation, low volatility, and high persistence in 
the environment have led to their global spread even to remote and distant 
regions. The present study identifies gaps in the investigation of the 
neurotoxic potential of PBDEs, their effects on brain development, 
toxicokinetic, and their potential as a carcinogen. In India, to date, only 
human breast milk was assessed for levels of PBDEs, and it is suggested that 
other human tissues can also be explored. No data on the reproductive toxicity 
of PBDEs are reported from Indian cohorts. Long-range transport and deposition 
of PBDEs in colder regions necessitates monitoring of Himalayan regions in 
India. An inventory of PBDEs is required to be made for addressing the worrisome 
situation of the unregulated import of E-waste from the developed countries in 
India. The study also emphasizes providing guidelines for the articulation of 
policies regarding sound surveillance and management of PBDE production, 
consumption, and release in the Indian context. It is recommended that a 
separate cell for monitoring and follow-up of PBDEs should be established in 
India. Also, the development of better alternatives and environment-friendly 
remediation technologies for PBDEs is the need of the hour.

BACKGROUND: Considered globally, prostate cancer is a disease of the aging male 
that increases in prevalence with exposure to screening and diagnostic testing, 
and which requires a population with the health and longevity to encounter it. 
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset is an aggregation of worldwide 
registries and health data systems that reports global and regional assessment 
of disease impact.
METHODS: Using the GBD database, 1171 worldwide registries and health 
registration systems from 1990 to 2016 were aggregated for prostate cancer 
disease codes and outcomes. Disease-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated 
and segregated by sociodemographic index (SDI) quintile, and compared to other 
urologic diseases and tuberculosis (TB).
RESULTS: Prostate cancer exerts a burden of disease that is vastly higher in the 
top quintile of SDI. The three lowest SDI quintiles represent the majority of 
global population but are currently less impacted by prostate cancer. 
Conversely, TB has its highest impact on the lowest SDI levels, although these 
rates are declining.
CONCLUSIONS: As a global disease, prostate cancer predominantly affects high SDI 
men who enjoy a longer life expectancy in which to suffer from this disease and 
a greater exposure to screening and diagnosis. As lower SDI men are elevated in 
health and income, reallocation of DALYs will occur, and a greater burden of 
prostate cancer can be expected. These epidemiologic trends have great 
implications for the allocation of resources, as the population of men affected 
by prostate cancer outpaces urologic workforce growth.

Future life expectancy in Europe taking into account the impact of smoking, 
obesity, and alcohol.

Groningen, The Hague, Netherlands.

Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.

Introduction: In Europe, women can expect to live on average 82 years and men 75 
years. Forecasting how life expectancy will develop in the future is essential 
for society. Most forecasts rely on a mechanical extrapolation of past mortality 
trends, which leads to unreliable outcomes because of temporal fluctuations in 
the past trends due to lifestyle 'epidemics'. Methods: We project life 
expectancy for 18 European countries by taking into account the impact of 
smoking, obesity, and alcohol on mortality, and the mortality experiences of 
forerunner populations. Results: We project that life expectancy in these 18 
countries will increase from, on average, 83.4 years for women and 78.3 years 
for men in 2014 to 92.8 years for women and 90.5 years for men in 2065. Compared 
to others (Lee-Carter, Eurostat, United Nations), we project higher future life 
expectancy values and more realistic differences between countries and sexes. 
Conclusions: Our results imply longer individual lifespans, and more elderly in 
society. Funding: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) (grant 
no. 452-13-001).

Plain Language Summary: On average, in Europe, men can currently expect to live 
till the age of 75 and women until they are 82. But what will their lifespans be 
in the next decades? Reliable answers to this question are essential to help 
governments plan for future health care and social security costs. While medical 
improvements are likely to further extend lifespans, lifestyle factors can 
result in temporal distortions of this trend. Yet, most estimates of future life 
expectancy fail to consider changing lifestyles, as they only use past mortality 
trends in their calculations. This can make these projections unreliable: for 
example, increases in smoking rates among Northern and Western European men led 
to stagnating male life expectancies in the 1950s and 1960s, but these picked up 
again after smoking declined. The same pattern is showing for women, except it 
is lagging as they took up smoking later than men. Based simply on the 
extrapolation of past mortality trends, current projection models fail to 
consider the past and predicted modifications of life expectancy trends prompted 
by changing rates of health behaviours – such as increases followed by 
(anticipated) declines in alcohol consumption and obesity rates, similar to what 
was observed with smoking. To produce a more reliable forecast, Janssen et al. 
incorporated trends in smoking, obesity, and alcohol use into life expectancy 
projections for 18 European countries. The predictions suggest that life 
expectancy for women in these countries will increase from 83.4 years in 2014 to 
92.8 years in 2065. For men, it will also go up, from 78.3 to 90.5 years. In the 
future, this integrative approach may help to track the effects of 
health-behaviour related prevention policies on life expectancy, and allow 
scientists to account for changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 
meantime, these estimates are higher than those obtained using more traditional 
methods; they suggest that communities should start to adjust to the possibility 
of longer individual lifespans, and of larger numbers of elderly people in 
society.

The aim of the study was to estimate the percentage of Medicare patients needing 
coronary access for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary 
angiography following aortic valve replacement (AVR). Indications for TAVR have 
expanded to include younger and low-risk patients, raising the question of 
coronary access for future procedures. Medicare patients <80 years old with an 
AVR between 2011 and 2018 were included. Time-to-event analyses were conducted 
using Cox hazard models to estimate risk of coronary access up to 7 years after 
AVR. Model adjustments included age, sex, race, region, comorbidity, concomitant 
CABG, and smoking. A total of 13,469 Medicare patients (mean age 70.6) met 
inclusion criteria. Models estimated that 2.5% of patients at 1-year post-index 
and 17% at over 7 years would need coronary access. For patients who had SAVR 
(with or without CABG), estimates for coronary access were similar and over 15% 
after 6.5 years. For TAVR patients, with a previous PCI, 28% at 4.5 years 
required coronary access, which was higher than TAVR patients without a previous 
PCI. SAVR patients with and without CAD at baseline were similar; however, TAVR 
patients with CAD had a 22% rate of coronary access versus 7% for those without 
at 3 years. Approximately half of patients who needed coronary access returned 
to the same hospital as their initial AVR. Coronary access is required in a 
substantial portion of AVR patients especially those with PCI or a history of 
CAD undergoing TAVR. The need for coronary access may increase as transcatheter 
AVR becomes accessible to younger patients with a longer life expectancy.

AIM: To evaluate the individual use and predictive value of focused 
echocardiography, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), invasive arterial blood 
pressure (BP) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) in children.
METHODS: This scoping review was undertaken as part of the continuous evidence 
evaluation process of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation 
(ILCOR) and based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL 
and EMBASE were searched from the last ILCOR reviews until September 2020. We 
included all published studies evaluating the effect of echocardiography, EtCO2, 
BP or NIRS guided CPR on clinical outcomes and quality of CPR.
RESULTS: We identified eight observational studies, including 288 children. Two 
case series reported the use of echocardiography, one in detecting pulmonary 
emboli, the second in cardiac standstill, where contractility was regained with 
the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The two studies describing EtCO2 
were ambivalent regarding the association between mean values and any outcomes. 
Mean diastolic BP was associated with increased survival and favourable 
neurological outcome, but not with new substantive morbidity in two studies 
describing an overlapping population. NIRS values reflected changes in EtCO2 and 
cerebral blood volume index in two studies, with lower values in patients who 
did not achieve return of circulation.
CONCLUSION: Although there seems some beneficial effect of these intra-arrest 
variables, higher quality paediatric studies are needed to evaluate whether 
echocardiography, EtCO2, BP or NIRS guided CPR could improve outcomes.

Borders, Immigrants, And Health.

[No authors listed]

There are roughly 45 million immigrants living in the United States. People from 
Mexico account for 25% of all US immigrants, although the demography of the 
immigrant population continues to change. Migration patterns along the US 
southern border are especially dynamic. Immigration and other policies affect 
the health of people on both sides of the US-Mexico border. Many factors, 
including citizenship status, geographic location, and language, influence 
immigrant health and contribute to disparities in life expectancy, health care 
access, and participation in safety-net programs.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of 
branded and authorized generic (AG) celecoxib for chronic pain patients with 
osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and low back pain (LBP), using 
real-world cost information for loxoprofen and pharmacotherapy for 
gastrointestinal bleeding.
METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis was performed as a long-term 
simulation using the Markov model from the Japanese public healthcare payer's 
perspective. The analysis was conducted using loxoprofen with real-world 
weighted price by branded/generic distribution (hereinafter, loxoprofen with 
weighted price) as a comparator. In the model, we simulated the prognosis of 
patients with chronic pain by OA, RA, and LBP treated with loxoprofen or 
celecoxib, over a lifetime period.
RESULTS: A cost-increase of 129,688 JPY (1,245.00 USD) for branded celecoxib and 
a cost-reduction of 6,268 JPY (60.17 USD) for AG celecoxib were recognized per 
patient in lifetime horizon, compared to loxoprofen with weighted price. No case 
was recognized to reverse the results of cost-saving by AG celecoxib in one-way 
sensitivity analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of branded 
celecoxib attained 5,403,667 JPY/QALY (51,875.20 USD/QALY), compared to 
loxoprofen with the weighted price.
CONCLUSION: The current cost-effectiveness analysis for AG celecoxib revealed 
its good value for costs, considering the patients' future risk of 
gastrointestinal injury; also, the impact on costs due to AG celecoxib against 
loxoprofen will be small. It implies that the disadvantage of AG celecoxib being 
slightly more expensive than generic loxoprofen could be offset by the good 
cost-effectiveness during the prognosis.

There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic interventions against 
SARS-CoV-2, including new variants that continue to arise. Neutralizing 
monoclonal antibodies have shown promise in clinical studies. We investigated 
the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of two potent monoclonal antibodies, 
C135-LS and C144-LS that carry half-life extension mutations, in the rhesus 
macaque model of COVID-19. Twelve young adult macaques (three groups of four 
animals) were inoculated intranasally and intra-tracheally with a high dose of 
SARS-CoV-2 and 24 hours later, treated intravenously with a high (40 mg/kg) or 
low (12 mg/kg) dose of the C135-LS and C144-LS antibody combination, or a 
control monoclonal antibody. Animals were monitored for 7 days. Compared to the 
control animals, animals treated with either dose of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 
antibodies showed similarly improved clinical scores, lower levels of virus 
replication in upper and lower respiratory tract, and significantly reduced 
interstitial pneumonia, as measured by comprehensive lung histology. In 
conclusion, this study provides proof-of-concept in support of further clinical 
development of these monoclonal antibodies against COVID-19 during early 
infection.

BACKGROUND: how long older individuals prefer to live given hypothetical adverse 
changes in health and living conditions has been insufficiently studied.
OBJECTIVES: the objective of this study is to investigate the relationship 
between six adverse health and living conditions and preferred life expectancy 
(PLE) after the age of 60 years.
DESIGN: cross-sectional face-to-face interviews.
SETTING: population-based sample.
PARTICIPANTS: 825 community dwellers aged 60 years and older in Norway.
METHODS: logistic regression models were used to analyse PLE, measured with a 
single question: 'If you could choose freely, until what age would you wish to 
live?' The impact on PLE of several hypothetical scenarios, such as being 
diagnosed with dementia, spousal death, becoming a burden, poverty, loneliness 
and chronic pain was analysed by age, sex, education, marital status, cognitive 
function, self-reported loneliness and chronic pain.
RESULTS: average PLE was 91.4 years (95% CI 90.9, 92.0), and there was no 
difference between men and women, but those at older ages had higher PLE than 
those at younger ages. The scenarios that had the strongest negative effects on 
PLE were dementia, followed by chronic pain, being a burden to society, 
loneliness, poverty and losing one's spouse. PLE among singles was not affected 
by the prospect of feeling lonely. The higher educated had lower PLE for 
dementia and chronic pain.
CONCLUSION: among Norwegians 60+, the desire to live into advanced ages is 
significantly reduced by hypothetical adverse life scenarios, with the strongest 
effect caused by dementia and chronic pain.

OBJECTIVE: This investigation estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
high-intensity training (HIT) compared with conventional physical therapy in 
individuals with subacute stroke, based on the additional personnel required to 
deliver the therapy.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a pilot study and subsequent randomized 
controlled trial.
SETTING: Outpatient laboratory setting.
PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from individuals with locomotor impairments 
1-6 months poststroke (N=44) who participated in HIT (n=27) or conventional 
physical therapy (n=17).
INTERVENTIONS: Individuals performing HIT practiced walking tasks in variable 
contexts (stairs, overground, treadmill) while targeting up to 80% maximum heart 
rate reserve. Individuals performing conventional therapy practiced 
impairment-based and functional tasks at lower intensities (<40% heart rate 
reserve).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs were assessed based on personnel use with 
availability of similar equipment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were calculated for quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) derived from the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 questionnaire 
and gains in self-selected speeds (SSSs).
RESULTS: Personnel costs were higher after HIT (mean, $1420±234) vs conventional 
therapy (mean, $1111±219), although between-group differences in QALYs (0.05 
QALYs; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0-0.10 QALYs) and SSS (0.20 m/s; 95% CI, 
0.05-0.35 m/s) favored HIT. ICERs were $6180 (95% CI, -$96,364 to $123,211) per 
QALY and $155 (95% CI, 38-242) for a 0.1 m/s gain in SSS.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional personnel to support HIT are relatively inexpensive but 
can add substantial effectiveness to subacute rehabilitation. Future research 
should evaluate patient factors that increase the likelihood of improvement to 
maximize the cost-effectiveness of treatment post stroke.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) was once a disease of childhood because of a limited 
life expectancy. Due to medical advances, it is now common for people with SCD 
to live into adulthood. Funding and resources for adults with SCD, however, 
remain limited. Adult patients would benefit from increased access to medical 
care, mental health care services, and workforce development. The Indiana Sickle 
Cell Consortium, a group of medical providers and community-based organizations, 
worked closely with people living with SCD and their family members to create a 
campaign advocating for state funding for programs for adults with SCD. This 
campaign culminated with the passage of a bill that provides $250,000 in funding 
for program development for adults with SCD. The bill also directs the Indiana 
Department of Health to carry out a needs assessment for people with SCD in 
Indiana. However, continued efforts are needed to reduce health disparities for 
people with SCD. The Indiana Sickle Cell Consortium will continue advocacy 
efforts in future legislative cycles and bring attention to the health 
inequities that affect people with SCD.

This RCT and mixed-methods study examined the difference between two groups 
receiving the following interventions: (1) brief manual standardized stress 
acupuncture (MSSA) combined with an abbreviated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 
(ACBT) versus (2) ACBT alone. Three study aims: Aim (1): Insomnia Severity Index 
(ISI) and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were analyzed using 
descriptive summaries, linear regression, and reliable change index (RCI). Aim 
(2): Journal entries were analyzed using content analysis. Aim (3): Acupuncture 
Expectancy Scale (AES) scores were analyzed using paired t-test and RCI. Aim 
(1): Both groups demonstrated similar improvements in the ISI scores (p = .480). 
Aim (2): The ACBT/MSSA group reported greater benefits in sleep and in other 
life areas including mental, physical, and social functioning. Aim (3): The AES 
showed that 21.6% had a clinically meaningful increase in expectations in the 
effect of acupuncture for stress (p = .965). The study was registered in 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04031365) at
