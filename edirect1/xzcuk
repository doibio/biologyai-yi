Cytoreductive Surgery With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, Part I: 
Introduction and Indications.

Dunn D.

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
(HIPEC) is used to treat peritoneal carcinomatosis, which often is secondary to 
gastrointestinal and ovarian cancers. During CRS, the surgeon resects cancerous 
tumors from the peritoneal cavity. During HIPEC, a chemotherapy agent is 
introduced into a solution that flows in and out of catheters in the abdominal 
cavity for approximately 90 minutes. The chemoperfusate is heated to 42° C 
(107.6° F), which kills cancer cells but is nonthreatening to normal cells. A 
primary goal of combining CRS with HIPEC is to apply targeted regional 
chemotherapy directly to the peritoneum to destroy residual micrometastatic 
disease while the tumor burden is minimal and before cancer cells become 
entrapped by the body's wound-healing processes. Although HIPEC usually is not 
curative, it can extend a patient's life expectancy three to five years. This is 
the first article in a two-part discussion of CRS with HIPEC.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a significant health problem in 
the industrialised world, currently increasing in developing countries. 
Understanding the global burden of IBD is important to tackle increasing disease 
occurrence.
AIM: To investigate the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2017 Study Database 
summarising and critically evaluating the global burden of IBD METHODS: We 
presented age-standardised prevalence estimates, disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) and its components: years lived with disability (YLDs) and years of life 
lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality. We reported these measures from 1990 to 
2017 and stratified by region, socio-demographic index (SDI), gender and age 
group.
RESULTS: The latest IBD prevalence and burden estimates varied widely across 
regions, and were particularly elevated in high-SDI countries. Despite an 
increasing prevalence from 1990 to 2017 (+6%), the IBD burden decreased (DALYs 
-12%). This decrease was driven by IBD-associated premature mortality (YLLs 
-26%). This measure represented a high share of disease burden in low-SDI 
countries (86% of DALYs), whereas disability constituted the predominant 
component in high-SDI countries (71%) in 2017. Disease burden decreased 
particularly in children (DALYs -39% and YLLs -52%). In the last 10 years, 
however, prevalence plateaued in middle- to high-SDI countries and steeply 
increased in low-SDI countries.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight significant improvements in IBD care in 
the last three decades, particularly in children. The global burden of IBD and 
premature mortality have progressively decreased. The increase in disease 
frequency observed in developing countries is worrying, especially considering 
the high associated premature mortality in these areas.

Kong, China.

BACKGROUND: There is a foreseeable trend that life expectancy is on the rise in 
many parts of the world. More and more patients will present with colorectal 
cancer at extreme old age and advanced age is a well-known risk factor for 
adverse outcomes after surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
outcomes of colorectal cancer surgery in patients aged 90 or above.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients aged 90 or above who 
underwent operations for colorectal cancer between January 1996 and December 
2015 was performed. The primary outcomes were the complications rate, 30-day and 
180-day mortality rates.
RESULTS: A total of 57 patients were included in the analysis. The majority of 
them were women (64.9%). The median age was 92 years. Most of the surgery was of 
curative intent (77.2%), performed under elective setting (57.9%) and with open 
approach (78.9%). 36.8% of patients had postoperative complications, with 
pneumonia being the commonest. The 30-day and 180-day mortality rate was 7 and 
31.6% respectively. History of ischemic heart disease and surgery under 
emergency setting were predictors of postoperative complications. Pneumonia, 
preoperative leukocytosis and Charlson comorbidity score ≥ 9 were predictors of 
180-day mortality. The one and two-year survival rate for elective surgery was 
69.7 and 54.5% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes of colorectal cancer surgery for nonagenarians could be 
favorable in a selected group of patients. Future study on better risk profiling 
and ways to improve outcomes is warranted.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between group exercise membership, 
social network characteristics, and general state anxiety in a sample of college 
students. Participants: 490 undergraduates from a private university in the 
southern US participated in the study. Methods: An egocentric network analysis 
was conducted to test whether demographic variables, leisure-time physical 
activity, group exercise membership, flourishing scores, and network variables 
were related to anxiety. Results: Regression analyses (R2 = .174, F = 7.650, p < 
.0001) suggest group exercise membership (β = -.105, p = .034) and flourishing 
scores (β = -.342, p < .0001) were related to lower anxiety scores, while being 
a racial/ethnic minority (β = .094, p = .036), and having personal networks 
composed of more people who exercise often (β = .100, p = .025), were related to 
higher anxiety scores in this sample. Conclusions: Findings suggest a connection 
between group exercise membership, activity habits of peers, and anxiety. 
Encouraging group exercise participation could be an effective way of combating 
anxiety for college students.

INTRODUCTION: In addition to their high mortality rates, road traffic collisions 
(RTC) are considered a burden within those who do survive. In Africa, injuries 
related to RTC have been identified as the 10th most common cause of 
disability-adjusted life years lost for all ages and categories. Moreover, 
non-fatal RTC are the biggest cause associated with the burden of 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) in Africa. Despite this, the epidemiology of MSD 
related to non-fatal RTC within this region is still unknown.The objective of 
this review is to identify and summarise available data regarding the 
prevalence, incidence and patterns of MSD resulting from non-fatal RTC in 
Africa.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review of observational epidemiological 
studies will be conducted. On October 2019, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, 
PsycINFO, Web of Science, Global Health and African Journals OnLine will be 
searched for literature that is in English and published between 1990 and 2018. 
Two reviewers (MY ad TG) will independently screen results and extract the data, 
with a third reviewer (FF) resolving any discrepancies through discussion. 
Additionally, two reviewers (MY and TG) will independently assess the quality of 
the eligible studies using the US National Institutes of Health National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tool.Within the eligible studies, 
data on citation, methods and results will be extracted. Extracted data will be 
analysed using a narrative synthesis. Findings will be presented in tables, with 
the main outcomes being prevalence, incidence and disease pattern of MSD and 
determinants of non-fatal RTC. The final systematic review will be conducted as 
per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guideline.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As individual patients will not be involved in this 
study, no ethical approval will be sought. Findings from this review will be 
disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and relevant conferences.

Reflections on the ISPOR Special Task Force on U.S. Value Frameworks: 
Implications of a Health Economics Approach for Managed Care Pharmacy.

In 2016, The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research 
(ISPOR) formed a special task force (STF) to review approaches and methods to 
support the definition and use of high-quality U.S. value frameworks. As the 
leadership group of that initiative, we present our perspective, focusing on 
implications for the managed care pharmacy community. Our reflections are 
organized by 9 key observations and conclude with a summary recommendation. We 
begin by emphasizing the importance of distinguishing among "perspectives" and 
"decision contexts." Possible perspectives include patient, payer, provider, 
health care sector, and societal. Decision contexts range from formulary 
inclusion to guideline development to clinical shared decision making, and 
multiple perspectives can be taken on each of these decisions. The STF focused 
on value in the context of including a new medicine in a formulary and, thus, 
health plan, using a health economics approach that compares marginal benefit 
(gross value) and marginal (opportunity) cost, yielding the net value. Health 
care is unique compared with other markets. While economists often use market 
purchases as indicators of value, they also recognize that this does not work 
well in health care, since most patent-protected drugs are covered by insurance. 
To assess the likely health and economic impact, health economists often employ 
cost-effectiveness analysis, using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), a 
metric that combines mortality and morbidity into a single preference-based 
index. We strongly endorse the STF's recommendation that payers should use the 
cost-per-QALY metric as a starting point. However, like the STF, and many of 
those stakeholders who provided input, we recognize that this metric has some 
limitations in theory and in practice. Nonetheless, the cost-per-QALY metric is 
a pragmatic tool that can be augmented to address some of its limitations by 
integrating other elements of value, particularly those related to uncertainty, 
such as financial risk protection, health risk protection, the value of hope, 
real option value, and the value of knowing. The resulting adjusted ratio can be 
compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold or combined in a measure of net 
monetary benefit. Alternatively, the array of elements can be valued using 
multi-criteria decision analysis. We end with the key recommendation that 
further development and testing of these promising approaches is needed to 
improve the deliberative process of health technology assessment. DISCLOSURES:

OBJECTIVES: As a person's age increases and his/her health status declines, new 
challenges arise that may lead physicians to consider deprescribing statins. We 
aimed to provide insight into recommendations available in international 
cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines regarding discontinuation of statin 
treatment applicable to older adults.
DESIGN: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EMCARE, and the websites of 
guideline development organizations and online guideline repositories for 
cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines aimed at the general population. We 
selected all guidelines with recommendations (instructions and suggestions) on 
discontinuation of statin treatment applicable to older adults, published 
between January 2009 and April 2019. In addition, we performed a synthesis of 
information from all other recommendations for older adults regarding statin 
treatment. Methodological quality of the included guidelines was appraised using 
the appraisal of guidelines for research & evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.
RESULTS: Eighteen international guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention 
in the general adult population provided recommendations for statin 
discontinuation that were applicable to older adults. We identified three groups 
of instructions for statin discontinuation related to statin intolerance, and 
none was specifically aimed at older adults. Three guidelines also included 
suggestions to consider statin discontinuation in patients with poor health 
status. Of the 18 guidelines included, 16 made recommendations regarding statin 
treatment in older adults, although details on how to implement these 
recommendations in practice were not provided.
CONCLUSION: Current international cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines 
provide little specific guidance for physicians who are considering statin 
discontinuation in older adults in the context of declining health status and 
short life expectancy. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:417-425, 2020.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, but 
access is often restricted due to costs and limited availability of trained 
therapists. Blending online and face-to-face CBT for depression might improve 
cost-effectiveness and treatment availability.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to examine the costs and effectiveness of 
blended CBT compared with standard CBT for depressed patients in specialized 
mental health care to guide further research and development of blended CBT.
METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to blended CBT (n=53) or standard CBT 
(n=49). Blended CBT consisted of 10 weekly face-to-face sessions and 9 Web-based 
sessions. Standard CBT consisted of 15 to 20 weekly face-to-face sessions. At 
baseline and 10, 20, and 30 weeks after start of treatment, self-assessed 
depression severity, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were 
measured. Clinicians, blinded to treatment allocation, assessed psychopathology 
at all time points. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Uncertainty 
intervals around cost and effect estimates were estimated with 5000 Monte Carlo 
simulations.
RESULTS: Blended CBT treatment duration was mean 19.0 (SD 12.6) weeks versus 
mean 33.2 (SD 23.0) weeks in standard CBT (P<.001). No significant differences 
were found between groups for depressive episodes (risk difference [RD] 0.06, 
95% CI -0.05 to 0.19), response to treatment (RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.15), 
and QALYs (mean difference 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04). Mean societal costs for 
blended CBT were €1183 higher than standard CBT. This difference was not 
significant (95% CI -399 to 2765). Blended CBT had a probability of being 
cost-effective compared with standard CBT of 0.02 per extra QALY and 0.37 for an 
additional treatment response, at a ceiling ratio of €25,000. For health care 
providers, mean costs for blended CBT were €176 lower than standard CBT. This 
difference was not significant (95% CI -659 to 343). At €0 per additional unit 
of effect, the probability of blended CBT being cost-effective compared with 
standard CBT was 0.75. The probability increased to 0.88 at a ceiling ratio of 
€5000 for an added treatment response, and to 0.85 at €10,000 per QALY gained. 
For avoiding new depressive episodes, blended CBT was deemed not cost-effective 
compared with standard CBT because the increase in costs was associated with 
negative effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that blended CBT might be a promising way to 
engage depressed patients in specialized mental health care. Compared with 
standard CBT, blended CBT was not considered cost-effective from a societal 
perspective but had an acceptable probability of being cost-effective from the 
health care provider perspective. Results should be carefully interpreted due to 
the small sample size. Further research in larger replication studies focused on 
optimizing the clinical effects of blended CBT and its budget impact is 
warranted.

INTRODUCTION: The constant increase in life expectancy for over 170 years is one 
of the biggest achievements of modern society. In Germany the probability of an 
80-year-old person becoming 100 years old has increased by a factor of 20 since 
the 1950s. This fact has various implications for the clinical routine and 
therapeutic guidelines. In addition to the quantitative factors (e.g. 
complications, recurrence rate), the quality of life (QoL) as a patient-centered 
subjective factor should be taken into consideration in the treatment options 
for hernia repair. To compare heterogeneous cohorts of patients regarding the 
QoL, a standardization based on representative reference values is absolutely 
essential.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on data from the follow-up of 310 
patients who underwent inguinal hernia repair at the surgery department of the 
University Hospital Rostock. The preoperative clinical examination of the 
patients and a questionnaire were supplemented by a postal follow-up survey 
postoperatively at a median of 20 months (follow-up rate 66%). Patient pain 
level was assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and health-unspecific QoL by 
the EQ-5D questionnaire. Standardization of the EQ-5D was based on a survey on a 
normative German reference population.
RESULTS: Analysis of the patients in the various treatment arms showed 
significant differences in age composition and health states (American Society 
of Anesthesologists, ASA scores) of the patient cohorts. A comparison of the QoL 
between the two mesh-based procedures, the transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) 
procedure and the Lichtenstein procedure, showed that complete recovery is 
possible after 6 months. A slight decrease in the QoL of the Lichtenstein cohort 
patients was ascertainable, which can be explained by the method and the higher 
age of the group. Taking the differences in age of the two groups into account 
led to a change of the QoL outcome.
CONCLUSION: The concept of QoL is currently becoming increasingly more important 
in the assessment of treatment procedures. When comparing several therapeutic 
procedures, a standardization must be undertaken to take the heterogeneity of 
patient cohorts into consideration. Analogous to the relative survival in cancer 
epidemiology, the measured QoL scores should be put in the relationship to the 
age and sex-specific reference of the general population in order to demonstrate 
the actual effect of the disease in question and its treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac metastasis from renal cell carcinoma is an exceptional 
event, particularly when there is lack of inferior vena cava involvement. Only a 
few cases have been reported worldwide so far.
CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a case of a 58-year-old man diagnosed with 
isolated right ventricular metastasis of renal cell carcinoma in the absence of 
direct inferior vena cava extension, who underwent surgical tumor resection 
using cardiopulmonary bypass.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of the cardiac mass with an understanding of the 
pathology is needed to prevent sudden death from acute heart failure or tumor 
embolism and improve the patient's quality of life.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major and steadily increasing global 
health challenge as the most common primary liver malignancy and leading cause 
of death in cirrhotic patients. The only hope for curative treatment or 
significant increase in life expectancy is early detection. Once patients have 
progressed towards end-stage HCC, effective treatment options are extremely 
limited on the background of a very high degree of heterogeneity in clinical 
presentation and outcome. Experimental chronic liver injury and cancer have been 
used extensively to mimic the human disease. In particular, mouse studies have 
advanced the field due to the ability to easily manipulate the mouse genome and 
transcriptome for mechanistic evaluations. In addition, they offer the 
opportunity to screen new therapeutic strategies cost-effectively and in quick 
high-throughput, large-scale formats. The most commonly used mouse models in HCC 
research can be categorized as chemotoxic, diet-induced, and genetically 
engineered models. It is important to note that no particular model mimics all 
features of a given HCC etiology or histological subtype, and each model poses 
advantages and disadvantages that need to be carefully considered.

Changes to the maternal inflammatory milieu may be a mechanism through which 
maternal psychosocial stress is transmitted to the fetus. Research investigating 
a limited number of immune markers may miss important signals. We take a 
proteomics approach to investigate maternal lifetime stress and 92 biomarkers of 
immune system status. Participants were enrolled in an urban, dual-site (Boston, 
n = 301 and New York City, n = 110) pregnancy cohort. We measured maternal 
lifetime history of stress and trauma using the validated Life Stressor 
Checklist-Revised (LSC-R). We measured a panel of 92 immune-related proteins in 
mid-pregnancy serum using proximity extension assay technology. We leveraged the 
dual-site study design to perform variable selection and inference within the 
cohort. First, we used LASSO to select immune markers related to maternal stress 
among Boston mothers. Then, we performed OLS regression to examine associations 
between maternal stress and LASSO-selected proteins among New York City mothers. 
LASSO regression selected 19 immune proteins with non-null coefficients (CCL11, 
CCL23, CD244, CST5, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL10, CX3CL1, FGF-23, IL-5, IL-7, IL-10, 
IL-17C, MCP-2, MMP-1, SLAMF1, ST1A1, TNF-β, and TWEAK). Of these, only the 
chemotactic cytokine CX3CL1 (i.e. fractalkine) was significantly associated with 
maternal stress among the validation sample (percent change in LSC-R score per 
1% increase in relative fractalkine expression: 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 
0.19, 1.28). Expanding research suggests fractalkine plays an important role in 
many aspects of pregnancy and fetal development and is stress-sensitive. We 
found that maternal lifetime history of stress and trauma was significantly 
associated with elevated serum fractalkine levels during pregnancy.

The WHO Global Patient Safety Challenge: Medication Without Harm recognises 
medication-related harm (MRH) as a global public health issue. Increased 
life-expectancy coupled with multimorbidity and polypharmacy leads to an 
increased incidence of MRH, especially in older adults: at a cost of 
approximately £400 million to the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Harm 
from medicines has long been recognised by geriatricians, and strategies have 
been developed to mitigate harm. In general, these have focused on the 
challenges of polypharmacy and appropriateness of medicines, but impact on the 
quality of life, clinical and economic outcomes has been variable and often 
disappointing. The problem of MRH in older adults will continue to grow unless a 
new approach is adopted. Emerging evidence suggests that we need to take a 
broader approach as described in our conceptual model, where well-recognised 
physiological changes are incorporated, as well as other rarely considered 
psychosocial issues that influences MRH. Parallels may be drawn between this 
approach and the management of geriatric syndromes. We propose there must be a 
greater emphasis on MRH, and it, of itself, should be considered as a geriatric 
syndrome, to bring the spotlight onto the problem and to send a clear signal 
from geriatric experts that this is an important issue that needs to be 
addressed using a co-ordinated and tailored approach across health and social 
care boundaries. This requires a more proactive approach to monitor and review 
the medicines of older adults in response to their changing need.

Cost-effectiveness of teduglutide in adult patients with short bowel syndrome: 
Markov modeling using traditional cost-effectiveness criteria.

BACKGROUND: Adults with short bowel syndrome have a high mortality and 
significant morbidity due to unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation that 
necessitate chronic use of parenteral nutrition (PN). Teduglutide is a novel 
therapy that promotes intestinal adaptation to improve rehabilitation but with a 
price >$400,000/y.
OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using 
teduglutide in US adult patients with short bowel syndrome.
METHODS: A Markov model evaluated the costs (in US dollars) and effectiveness 
(in quality-adjusted life years, or QALYs) of treatment compared with no 
teduglutide use, with a presumed starting age of 40 y. Parameters were obtained 
from published data or estimation. The primary effect modeled was the increased 
likelihood of reduced PN days per week when using teduglutide, leading to 
greater quality of life and lower PN costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed 
on all model parameters.
RESULTS: In the base scenario, teduglutide cost $949,910/QALY gained. In 1-way 
sensitivity analyses, only reducing teduglutide cost decreased the cost/QALY 
gained to below the typical threshold of $100,000/QALY gained. Specifically, 
teduglutide cost would need to be reduced by >65% for it to reach the threshold 
value. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis favored no teduglutide use in 80% of 
iterations at a $100,000/QALY threshold. However, teduglutide therapy was 
cost-saving in 13% of model iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Teduglutide does not meet a traditional cost-effectiveness 
threshold as treatment for PN reduction in adult patients with short bowel 
syndrome compared with standard intestinal rehabilitation. Subpopulations that 
demonstrate maximum benefit could be cost-saving, and complete nonuse could lead 
to financial loss. Teduglutide becomes economically reasonable only if its cost 
is substantially reduced.

BACKGROUND: To compare estimated costs and health outcomes of lifestyle 
interventions for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in women who had 
gestational diabetes.
METHODS: An age-specific Markov model was applied comparing costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of three alternatives: 'doing nothing'; an 
annual reminder system (ARS) with an awareness campaign ('ARS-awareness'); and 
an ARS with an intensive lifestyle intervention ('ARS-ILS'). A healthcare payer 
perspective was adopted, the time horizon was 30 years and the setting was 
Flanders (Belgium). Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: 'ARS-awareness' was extendedly dominated. Per 10 000 participants, 
'ARS-ILS' cost €13 210 256 more and gained 496 QALYs compared with 'doing 
nothing' (26 632 €/QALY), with a 63% probability of being cost effective, given 
a cost effectiveness threshold of 35 000 €/QALY. A scenario analysis showed that 
'ARS-ILS' for 15 years only offered to women with prediabetes (compared with 
'doing nothing') has an 89.5% likelihood of being dominant.
CONCLUSIONS: 'ARS-ILS' may be the preferred intervention. However, the 
probability of being cost effective was low. Based on further scenario analyses, 
we recommend healthcare decision makers to consider the application of a more 
intensive alternative, focused on the highest risk profiles and with a shorter 
intervention duration.

Markov models are often used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new 
healthcare interventions but they are sometimes not flexible enough to allow 
accurate modeling or investigation of alternative scenarios and policies. A 
Markov model previously demonstrated that a one-off invitation to screening for 
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) for men aged 65 y in the UK and subsequent 
follow-up of identified AAAs was likely to be highly cost-effective at 
thresholds commonly adopted in the UK (£20,000 to £30,000 per quality adjusted 
life-year). However, new evidence has emerged and the decision problem has 
evolved to include exploration of the circumstances under which AAA screening 
may be cost-effective, which the Markov model is not easily able to address. A 
new model to handle this more complex decision problem was needed, and the case 
of AAA screening thus provides an illustration of the relative merits of Markov 
models and discrete event simulation (DES) models. An individual-level DES model 
was built using the R programming language to reflect possible events and 
pathways of individuals invited to screening v. those not invited. The model was 
validated against key events and cost-effectiveness, as observed in a large, 
randomized trial. Different screening protocol scenarios were investigated to 
demonstrate the flexibility of the DES. The case of AAA screening highlights the 
benefits of DES, particularly in the context of screening studies.

BACKGROUND: Data to inform evidence-based policy of human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccine delivery strategies in low- and middle-income countries are limited. We 
examined the cost-effectiveness of campaign compared with routine delivery 
strategies of adolescent female HPV vaccination in Uganda.
METHODS: We used a multiple modeling approach that captured HPV transmission, 
cervical carcinogenesis, and population demographics to project health and 
economic outcomes associated with HPV vaccination. Costs included vaccination 
and operational costs and cervical cancer costs over the lifetimes of the 
current female population in Uganda. Health outcomes included number of cervical 
cancer cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., cost per DALY averted) were calculated and 
compared against gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
RESULTS: Compared with routine HPV vaccination of 9-year-old girls at 70% 
coverage, campaign vaccination yielded greater health benefits if campaigns 
occurred frequently and targeted a wide age range. Campaign delivery strategies 
were both less costly and more effective than routine HPV vaccination. Campaign 
vaccination of 9- to 30-year-old girls/women at a 3-year frequency (40% 
coverage) was considered cost-effective compared with the GDP per capita 
threshold for Uganda ($674 in U.S. 2015 dollars).
CONCLUSIONS: We projected that campaign HPV vaccination would provide 
substantial population health benefits compared with routine vaccination. 
Expanding the target age range of campaign vaccination up to age 30 years may be 
an efficient strategy, depending on the achievable coverage level and campaign 
frequency.
IMPACT: In settings where routine health systems infrastructure may be limited, 
reaching adolescent populations with a campaign delivery strategy may be an 
efficient use of resources.

The existing molecular cloning methods are often limited by the availability of 
suitable restriction sites. It is still a challenge for simultaneous cloning of 
multiple fragments into different sites of a single vector. Here we developed a 
novel method named improved overlap extension PCR (IOEP) for restriction enzyme 
independent cloning of large fragments. The addition of primers enables IOEP to 
exponentially amplify the overlap extension product, thus greatly improves the 
amplification efficiency of large fragments. Moreover, coupled with the benefit 
of T4 DNA polymerase to improve cloning efficiency, our method can be used to 
simultaneously insert, delete and replace multiple DNA fragments at different 
sites.

Extraordinary advances in medicine and public health have contributed to 
increasing life expectancy worldwide. However, health span-"healthy aging"-has 
paradoxically lagged to parallel this increase. Consequently, aging-associated 
illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease and aging frailty, are having a growing 
impact on patients, their families, and entire health-care systems. Typically, 
such disorders have been treated as isolated disease entities. However, the 
inextricable links between aging-associated disorders and the aging process 
itself have become increasingly recognized, leading to formation of the field of 
geroscience. The geroscience concept is that treating the aging process itself 
should lead to treatment and prevention of aging-related disorders. However, the 
aging process is complex, dictated by highly interrelated pleiotropic processes. 
As such, therapeutics with pleiotropic mechanisms of action (either alone, or as 
part of combinatorial strategies) will be required for preventing and treating 
both aging and related disorders. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have multiple 
mechanisms of action that make these highly promising geroscience therapeutic 
candidates. These cells have a high safety profile for clinical use, are 
amenable to allogeneic use since tissue-type matching is not required, and can 
have sustained activity after transplantation. Herein, we review preclinical and 
clinical data supporting the utility of allogeneic MSCs as a geroscience 
therapeutic candidate.

Super-enhancers (SEs) are critical for the transcriptional regulation of gene 
expression. We developed the super-enhancer archive version 3.0 (SEA v. 3.0, 
http://sea.edbc.org) to extend SE research. SEA v. 3.0 provides the most 
comprehensive archive to date, consisting of 164 545 super-enhancers. Of these, 
80 549 are newly identified from 266 cell types/tissues/diseases using an 
optimized computational strategy, and 52 have been experimentally confirmed with 
manually curated references. We now support super-enhancers in 11 species 
including 7 new species (zebrafish, chicken, chimp, rhesus, sheep, Xenopus 
tropicalis and stickleback). To facilitate super-enhancer functional analysis, 
we added several new regulatory datasets including 3 361 785 typical enhancers, 
chromatin interactions, SNPs, transcription factor binding sites and SpCas9 
target sites. We also updated or developed new criteria query, genome 
visualization and analysis tools for the archive. This includes a tool based on 
Shannon Entropy to evaluate SE cell type specificity, a new genome browser that 
enables the visualization of SE spatial interactions based on Hi-C data, and an 
enhanced enrichment analysis interface that provides online enrichment analyses 
of SE related genes. SEA v. 3.0 provides a comprehensive database of all 
available SE information across multiple species, and will facilitate 
super-enhancer research, especially as related to development and disease.
