Urate oxidase is a key enzyme in purine metabolism and catalyzes the oxidation 
of uric acid to allantoin. It is used to treat hyperuricemia and gout, and also 
in a diagnostic kit. In this study, error-prone polymerase chain reaction and 
staggered extension process was used to generate a mutant urate oxidase with 
improved enzyme activity from Bacillus subtilis. After several rounds of 
mutagenesis and screening, two mutants 6E9 and 8E279 were obtained which 
exhibited 2.99 and 3.43 times higher catalytic efficiency, respectively. They 
also exhibited lower optimal reaction temperature and higher thermo-stability. 
D44V, Q268R and K285Q were identified as the three most beneficial amino acid 
substitutions introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. D44V/Q268R, which was 
obtained through random combination of the three mutants, displayed the highest 
catalytic activity. The Km, kcat/Km and enzyme activity of D44V/Q268R increased 
by 68%, 83% and 129% respectively, compared with that of wild-type urate 
oxidase. Structural modeling indicated that mutations far from the active site 
can have significant effects on activity. For many of them, the underlying 
mechanisms are still difficult to explain from the static structural model. We 
also compared the effects of the same set of single point mutations on the wild 
type and on the final mutant. The results indicate strong effects of epistasis, 
which may imply that the mutations affect catalysis through influences on 
protein dynamics besides equilibrium structures.

The economic cost of tobacco use is well documented in high-income countries. It 
has been measured in relatively fewer low-and middle-income countries, and much 
less in sub-Saharan Africa despite the longstanding recognition of significant 
current and future health risk to people attributed by tobacco use in this 
region. This article fills this gap by estimating the economic cost of tobacco 
use in Uganda, a low-income country in sub-Saharan Africa. This study estimates 
the economic cost of tobacco use in Uganda using the cost-of-illnesses approach 
based on data collected from a survey of patients and caregivers in four major 
service centers in Mulago National Referral Hospital, namely, Uganda Cancer 
Institute, Uganda Heart Institute, Chest Clinic and Diabetic Clinic, key 
informant interviews and secondary sources for the year 2014. The total direct 
health care and non-health care cost of tobacco-related illnesses in Uganda was 
USD 41.56 million. The total indirect morbidity and mortality costs from the 
loss of productivity due to tobacco-related illnesses were USD 11.91 million and 
USD 73.01 million, respectively. The direct and indirect costs of tobacco use 
added up to USD 126.48 million, which is equivalent to 0.5% of GDP, a proportion 
comparable to the estimated health cost of tobacco use in other countries. The 
total health care cost of tobacco-related illnesses constitutes 2.3% of the 
national health care account which is already over-burdened with the cost of 
infectious diseases, limited medical personnel and infrastructure. In addition, 
tobacco-related illnesses heavily reduce life expectancy of tobacco users and 
ultimately their economic productivity. The cost of tobacco-related illnesses in 
Uganda far outweighs the benefits of employment and tax revenue generated from 
the tobacco sector. Stronger tobacco control measures need to be undertaken to 
reduce the disease and economic burden of tobacco use in this country.

Biological aging measures have been proposed as proxies for extension of healthy 
life span in trials of geroprotective therapies that aim to slow aging. Several 
methods to measure biological aging show promise but it is not known if these 
methods are sensitive to changes caused by geroprotective therapy. We conducted 
analysis of two proposed methods to quantify biological aging using data from a 
recently concluded trial of an established geroprotector, caloric restriction. 
We obtained data from the National Institute on Aging CALERIE randomized trial 
through its public-access biobank (https://calerie.duke.edu/). The CALERIE trial 
randomized N = 220 nonobese adults to 25% caloric restriction (n = 145; 11.7% 
caloric restriction was achieved, on average) or to maintain current diet (n = 
75) for 2 years. We analyzed biomarker data collected at baseline, 12-, and 
24-month follow-up assessments. We applied published biomarker algorithms to 
these data to calculate two biological age measures, Klemera-Doubal Method 
Biological Age and homeostatic dysregulation. Intent-to-treat analysis using 
mixed-effects growth models of within-person change over time tested if caloric 
restriction slowed increase in measures of biological aging across follow-up. 
Analyses of both measures indicated caloric restriction slowed biological aging. 
Weight loss did not account for the observed effects. Results suggest future 
directions for testing of geroprotective therapies in humans.

OBJECTIVE: Omalizumab add-on to standard-of-care therapy has proven to be 
efficacious in severe asthma patients for whom exacerbations cannot be 
controlled otherwise. Moreover, evidence from different healthcare settings 
suggests reduced healthcare resource utilization with omalizumab. Based on these 
findings, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the addition of 
omalizumab to standard-of-care therapy in patients with uncontrolled severe 
allergic asthma in a Brazilian healthcare setting.
METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted using Brazil-specific 
unit costs to compare the costs and outcomes of the addition of omalizumab to 
standard-of-care therapy vs standard-of-care therapy alone. Model inputs were 
largely based on the eXpeRience study. Costs and health outcomes were calculated 
for lifetime-years and were annually discounted at 5%. Both one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: An additional cost of R$280,400 for 5.20 additional quality-adjusted 
life-years was estimated with the addition of omalizumab to standard-of-care 
therapy, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R$53,890. 
One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that discount rates, standard-of-care 
therapy exacerbation rates, and exacerbation-related mortality rates had the 
largest impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
LIMITATIONS: Assumptions of lifetime treatment adherence and rate of future 
exacerbations, independent of previous events, might affect the findings. The 
lack of Brazilian patients in the eXpeRience study may affect the findings, 
although sample size and baseline characteristics suggest that the modeled 
population closely resembles Brazilian severe allergic asthma patients.
CONCLUSION: Results indicate that omalizumab as an add-on therapy is more 
cost-effective than standard-of-care therapy alone for Brazilian patients with 
uncontrolled severe allergic asthma, based on the World Health Organization's 
cost-effectiveness threshold of up to 3-times the gross domestic product.

AIMS: An increase in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among 
gram-negative pathogens has been noted recently. A challenge in empiric 
treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) is identifying initial 
appropriate antibiotic therapy, which is associated with reduced length of stay 
and mortality compared with inappropriate therapy. The objective of this study 
was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole 
compared with piperacillin/tazobactam (commonly used in this indication) in the 
treatment of patients with cIAI in UK hospitals.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Monte Carlo simulation model was used to compare 
costs (antibiotic and hospitalization costs) and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) of patients infected with gram-negative cIAI and treated empirically 
with either ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole or piperacillin/tazobactam. 
Bacterial isolates were randomly drawn from the Program to Assess 
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database, a surveillance database 
of non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from patients in the UK infected 
with gram-negative pathogens. Susceptibility to initial empiric therapy was 
based on the measured susceptibilities reported in the PACTS database.
RESULTS: Ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole was cost-effective when compared 
with piperacillin/tazobactam, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of £4,350/QALY and 0.36 hospitalization days/patient saved. Costs in the 
ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole arm were £2,576/patient, compared with 
£2,168/patient in the piperacillin/tazobactam arm. The 
ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole arm experienced a greater number of QALYs 
than the piperacillin/tazobactam arm (14.31/patient vs 14.21/patient, 
respectively). Ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole remained cost-effective in 
one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic models can help to identify the appropriate choice of 
empiric therapy for the treatment of cIAI. Results indicated that empiric use of 
ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole is cost-effective vs 
piperacillin/tazobactam in UK patients with cIAI at risk of resistant infection. 
This will be valuable to commissioners and clinicians to aid decision-making on 
the targeting of resources for appropriate antibiotic therapy under the premise 
of antimicrobial stewardship.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors have to deal with a wide range of physical 
symptoms, psychological, social and existential concerns, and lifestyle issues 
related to cancer and its treatment. Therefore, it is essential that they have 
access to optimal supportive care services. The eHealth self-management 
application Oncokompas was developed to support cancer survivors with where they 
need to turn to for advice and guidance, as well as to increase their knowledge 
on the availability of optimal support. A randomised controlled trial will be 
conducted to assess the efficacy, cost-utility and reach of Oncokompas as an 
eHealth self-management application compared with care as usual among cancer 
survivors.
METHODS/DESIGN: Adult cancer survivors diagnosed with breast, colorectal or head 
and neck cancer or lymphoma who are at 3 months to 5 years since curative 
treatment will be included. In total, 544 cancer survivors will be randomly 
assigned to the intervention group or a wait-list control group. The primary 
outcome measure is patient activation. Secondary outcome measures include 
self-efficacy, personal control, perceived patient-physician interaction, need 
for supportive care, mental adjustment to cancer and health-related quality of 
life. Furthermore, cost-utility outcomes will be assessed. Reach is defined as 
the percentage of cancer survivors who get access to Oncokompas within the 
context of this trial. Questionnaires will be administered at baseline, 
post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.
DISCUSSION: In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and cost-utility of 
Oncokompas among cancer survivors, as well as the reach of Oncokompas. These are 
essential first steps in the translation of research into practice and 
contribute to sustainable adoption, implementation and maintenance of an 
evidence-based Oncokompas.

BACKGROUND: Childhood mortality has remained a major challenge to public health 
amongst families in Nigeria and other developing countries. The menace of 
incessant childhood mortality has been a major concern and this calls for 
studies to generate new scientific evidence to determine its prevalence and 
explore predisposing factors associated with it in Nigeria.
METHOD: Data was obtained from Nigeria DHS, 2013. The study outcome variable was 
the total number of children lost by male partners and female partners 
respectively who were married. The difference between the numbers of child 
births and the number of living children was used to determine the number of 
children lost. Study variables were obtained for 8658 couples captured in the 
data set. Descriptive statistics were computed to examine the presence of 
over-dispersion and zero occurrences. Data were analysed using STATA Software 
version 12.0. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression analysis was 
carried out to determine the factors associated with childhood mortality. 
Results of ZINB were reported in terms of IRR and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: The age (mean ± std.) of male and female participants were 36.88 ± 7.37 
and 28.59 ± 7.30 respectively. The data showed that 30.8% women reported loss of 
children and 37.3% men reported the same problem. The study revealed age 
(years), region, residence, education, wealth index, age at first birth and 
religion of father and mother as factors associated with childhood mortality. In 
terms of education, secondary and tertiary educated fathers exhibited 3.8% and 
12.1% lower risk of childhood mortality respectively than non-educated fathers. 
The results showed that the risk of childhood mortality are 26.7%, 39.7 and 
45.9% lower among the mothers having primary, secondary and tertiary education 
respectively than those with no formal education. The mothers living in rural 
areas experienced 28.3% increase in childhood mortality than those in urban 
areas, while the fathers in rural areas experienced 33.5% increase in childhood 
mortality than the urban areas. The risk of childhood mortality was 
significantly lower in middle, richer and richest (11.1%, 37.5 and 49%) economic 
quintiles respectively when compared to the risk of childhood mortality with 
female spouse who are poorest. Similar results were obtained for the fathers, 
with reduction in the incidence-rate ratio of 3.3%, 20.2 and 28.7% for middle, 
richer and richest economic quintiles respectively, compared to the poorest 
status. Furthermore, region and religion were found to be significant factors 
associated with childhood mortality in Nigeria.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that age, region, residence, education, 
wealth index, age at first birth and religion of fathers and mothers are key 
determinants associated with childhood mortality. The correlation between 
childhood mortality and fathers' and mothers' ages were found to increase the 
incidence of the outcome for every unit increase in age. The converse was 
however, true for age at first birth which was also statistically significant. 
The implication of this study is that policy makers and stakeholders in health 
care should provide for improved living standards to achieve good life 
expectancy meeting SDG3.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is considered the gold 
standard in bariatric surgery, achieving durable long-term weight loss with 
improvement of obesity-related comorbidities. Lately, the laparoscopic mini 
gastric bypass (LMGB) has gained worldwide popularity with similar results to 
LRYGB in terms of weight loss and comorbidity resolution. However, there is a 
lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing LMGB and LRYGB. This 
article describes the design and protocol of a randomized controlled trial 
comparing the outcomes of these two bariatric procedures.
METHODS/DESIGN: The trial is designed as a single center, randomized, patient 
and observer blinded trial. The relevant ethics committee has approved the trial 
protocol. To demonstrate that LMGB is not inferior to LRYGB in terms of excess 
weight loss (EWL) the study is conducted as a non-inferiority trial with the 
sample-size calculations performed accordingly. EWL 12 months after surgery is 
the primary endpoint, whereas 3-year EWL, morbidity, mortality, remission of 
obesity related comorbidities, quality of life (QOL) and hormonal and lipid 
profile changes are secondary endpoints. Eighty patients, 18 years or older and 
with a body mass index (BMI) between 35 and 50 kg/m2 who meet the Swiss 
guidelines for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity will be randomized. The 
endpoints and baseline measurements will be assessed pre-surgery, peri-surgery 
and post-surgery (fixed follow up measurements are at discharge and at the time 
points 6 weeks and 12 and 36 months postoperatively).
DISCUSSION: With its 3-year follow up time, this RCT will provide important data 
on the impact of LMGB and LRYGB on EWL, remission of comorbidities, QOL and 
hormonal and lipid profile changes.

The management of inherited coagulation disorders such as hemophilia A and B has 
witnessed dramatic progresses since the last few decades of the last century. 
Accordingly, persons with hemophilia (PWH) now enjoy a life expectancy at birth 
not different from that of males in the general population, at least in high 
income countries. Nowadays, a substantial proportion of PWH are aging, like 
their peers in the general population. This outstanding progress is accompanied 
by problems that are in part similar to those of any old person (multiple 
concomitant diseases and the resulting intake of multiple drugs other than those 
specific for hemophilia treatment). In addition, older PWH suffer from the 
consequences of the comorbidities that developed when their treatment was at the 
same time poorly available and unsafe. Typical hemophilia comorbidities affect 
the musculoskeletal system following joint and muscle bleeds, but also the liver 
and kidney are often impaired due to previous bloodborne infections such as 
viral hepatitis and HIV. Thus, the comorbidities of hemophilia superimposed on 
the multimorbidity and polypharmacy associated with aging create peculiar 
problems in the current management of these patients, that demand the 
coordinated holistic intervention of internists, geriatricians and clinical 
pharmacologists in addition to the care traditionally provided by pediatricians 
and hematologists.

The results of the Placement of AoRtic TraNscathetER Valves (PARTNER) 2 trial 
established the feasibility of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for 
intermediate surgical risk patients. The expansion of TAVR into the low-risk 
patient population will largely depend on its durability outcomes due to the 
high life expectancy in low-risk patients. Long-term follow-up results from 
low-risk clinical trials will take several years to be reported. Given this, we 
performed a systematic review of current long-term data to provide further 
insights into TAVR durability and long-term patient survival. We searched 
MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, BIOSIS, and major conference abstracts for TAVR 
studies with follow-up of at least 4 years. Abstracts were retrieved and 
independently reviewed for eligibility. Final studies were selected irrespective 
of the type of TAVR valve, route of vascular access, or surgical risk profile. A 
total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. We reviewed data from these 
studies with emphasis on long-term survival and echocardiographic findings.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of corneal collagen crosslinking 
(CXL) for progressive keratoconus from the healthcare payer's perspective.
DESIGN: A probabilistic Markov-type model using data from published clinical 
trials and cohort studies.
PARTICIPANTS: Two identical cohorts, each comprising 1000 virtual patients with 
progressive bilateral keratoconus, were modeled; one cohort underwent CXL and 
the other cohort received no intervention.
METHODS: Both cohorts were modeled and evaluated annually over a lifetime. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total cost, disease progression, and the 
probability of corneal transplantation, graft failure, or both were calculated 
based on data from published trials and cohort studies. These outcomes were 
compared between the 2 cohorts. In our base scenario, the stabilizing effect of 
CXL was assumed to be 10 years; however, longer durations also were analyzed. 
One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the 
outcomes.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as 
euros per QALY.
RESULTS: Assuming a 10-year effect of CXL, the ICER was €54 384/QALY 
($59 822/QALY). When we adjusted the effect of CXL to a lifelong stabilizing 
effect, the ICER decreased to €10 149/QALY ($11 163/QALY). Other sensitivity and 
scenario analyses that had a relevant impact on ICER included the discount rate, 
visual acuity before CXL, and healthcare costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Corneal collagen crosslinking for progressive keratoconus is cost 
effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times the current gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita. Moreover, a longer stabilizing effect of CXL 
increases cost effectiveness. If CXL had a stabilizing effect on keratoconus of 
15 years or longer, then the ICER would be less than the 1 × GDP per capita 
threshold and thus very cost effective.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a measure of systemic 
inflammation that appears prognostic in localized and advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). Increased systemic inflammation portends a poorer prognosis 
in cancer patients. We hypothesized that low NLR at diagnosis is associated with 
improved overall survival (OS) in locally advanced NSCLC (LANSCLC) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records from 276 patients with stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC 
treated with definitive chemoradiation with or without surgery between 2000 and 
2010 with adequate data were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographic data 
and pretreatment peripheral blood absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were 
collected. Patients were grouped into quartiles based on NLR. OS was estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare mortality 
between groups. A linear test-for-trend was used for the NLR quartile groups. 
The Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: The NLR was prognostic for OS (p < .0001). Median survival in months 
(95% confidence interval) for the first, second, third, and fourth quartile 
groups of the population distribution of NLR were 27 (19-36), 28 (22-34), 22 
(12-31), and 10 (8-12), respectively. NLR remained prognostic for OS after 
adjusting for race, sex, stage, performance status, and chemoradiotherapy 
approach (p = .004).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, our series is the largest to demonstrate that 
baseline NLR is a significant prognostic indicator in LANSCLC patients who 
received definitive chemoradiation with or without surgery. As an indicator of 
inflammatory response, it should be explored as a potential predictive marker in 
the context of immunotherapy and radiation therapy.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio measured at the time of 
diagnosis was associated with improved overall survival in 276 patients with 
stage IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive 
chemoradiation with or without surgery. To our knowledge, our series is the 
largest to demonstrate that baseline neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is a 
significant prognostic indicator in locally advanced NSCLC patients who received 
definitive chemoradiation with or without surgery. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio 
is an inexpensive biomarker that may be easily utilized by clinicians at the 
time of locally advanced NSCLC diagnosis to help predict life expectancy.

摘要 背景. 中性粒细胞‐淋巴细胞比值（NLR）是全身炎症的衡量指标, 
而后者在局部晚期非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）中具有预后作用。癌症患者全身炎症增加意味着预后较差。我们假设局部晚期NSCLC（LANSCLC）患者诊断时NLR较低与总生存期（OS）改善相关。 
患者和方法. 
我们回顾性分析了2000年至2010年期间接受确定性放化疗联合或不联合手术治疗且具有充分数据的276例IIIA期和IIIB期NSCLC患者的记录。采集基线人口统计学数据和治疗前外周血中性粒细胞和淋巴细胞绝对计数。根据NLR四分位数对患者进行分组。采用Kaplan‐Meier法估计OS。采用时序检验比较各组的死亡率。采用线性趋势检验分析各个NLR四分位数组。使用Cox比例风险模型进行多变量分析。 
结果. 
NLR是OS的预后指标（p<0.0001）。NLR人群分布的第一、二、三和四四分位数组的中位生存期（95%置信区间）分别为27（19‐36）、28（22‐34）、22（12‐31）和10（8‐12）个月。校正人种、性别、分期、体力状态和放化疗方法后, 
NLR仍然是OS的预后指标（p=0.004）。 结论. 据我们所知, 
本研究是规模最大的证明基线NLR是接受过确定性放化疗联合或不联合手术治疗的LANSCLC患者的显著预后指标的研究。NLR是炎症反应的指标, 
应将其作为免疫治疗和放射治疗的潜在预测标志物进行探索。The Oncologist 2017;22:737–742 
对临床实践的提示：在276例接受过确定性放化疗联合或不联合手术治疗的IIIA期和IIIB期NSCLC患者中, 
诊断时测定的中性粒细胞‐淋巴细胞比值与总生存期改善相关。据我们所知, 
本研究是规模最大的证明基线中性粒细胞‐淋巴细胞比值是接受过确定性放化疗联合或不联合手术治疗的局部晚期NSCLC患者的显著预后指标的研究。临床医生在诊断局部晚期NSCLC时可使用中性粒细胞‐淋巴细胞比值作为生物标志物, 
该方法成本低廉且简单易行, 可帮助预测预期寿命。

University, Republic of Korea.

[Purpose] Although lung capacity in the elderly is affected by age, little 
research has been performed studying decreasing lung capacity in relation to 
increasing life expectancy. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 
increased life span on the lung capacity of women. [Subjects and Methods] The 
subjects of this study were 55 healthy elderly women over 60 years of age who 
were living in Busan. Subjects were classified in the following age categories: 
60s, 70s and 80s. For the pulmonary function test, a spirometry (Pony FX, COSMED 
Inc., Italy) was used. The item for measurement of pulmonary function in elderly 
women was maximum-effort expiratory spirogram (MES). The pulmonary function test 
was performed 3 times, and its mean value was used for analysis. [Results] Among 
items of maximum-effort expiratory spirogram, a significant difference according 
to age was demonstrated in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 
second, peak expiratory flow, maximum expiratory flow 75%, maximum expiratory 
flow 50%, and inspiratory capacity. [Conclusion] According to this study, lung 
capacity decreases remarkably as age increases. In conclusion, a continuous 
exercise program beginning at an early age is essential to prevent decrease in 
lung capacity as age progresses.

AIM: To assess liver fibrosis (LF) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcoholic 
liver disease (ALD), estimate health outcomes and costs of new noninvasive 
testing strategies.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate LF progression in HCV and ALD 
for a cohort of 40-year-old men with abnormal levels of transaminases. Three 
different testing alternatives were studied: a single liver biopsy; annual 
Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF™) followed by liver stiffness measurement (LSM) 
imaging as a confirmation test if the ELF test is positive; and annual ELF test 
without LSM. The analysis was performed from the perspective of a university 
hospital in Spain. Clinical data were obtained from published literature. Costs 
were sourced from administrative databases of the hospital. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In HCV patients, annual sequential ELF test/LSM and annual ELF test 
alone prevented respectively 12.9 and 13.3 liver fibrosis-related deaths per 100 
persons tested, compared to biopsy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were respectively €13400 and €11500 per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). In ALD, fibrosis-related deaths decreased by 11.7 and 22.1 per 100 
persons tested respectively with sequential ELF test/LSM and annual ELF test 
alone. ICERs were €280 and €190 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The use of the ELF test with or without a confirmation LSM are 
cost-effective options compared to a single liver biopsy for testing liver 
fibrosis in HCV and ALD patients in Spain.

Stable coronary artery disease (CAD) is a clinical entity of great 
epidemiological importance. It is becoming increasingly common due to the longer 
life expectancy, being strictly related to age and to advances in diagnostic 
techniques and pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Stable CAD 
encompasses a variety of clinical and anatomic presentations, making the 
identification of its clinical and anatomical features challenging. Therapeutic 
interventions should be defined on an individual basis according to the 
patient's risk profile. To this aim, management flow charts have been reviewed 
based on sustainability and appropriateness derived from recent evidence. 
Special emphasis has been placed on non-pharmacological interventions, stressing 
the importance of lifestyle changes, including smoking cessation, regular 
physical activity, and diet. Adherence to therapy as an emerging risk factor is 
also discussed.

The majority of patients with bile duct cancer are diagnosed with clinically 
advanced disease. Most of these patients have a short life expectancy and are 
treated with palliative aim. Most patients present with locally advanced or 
metastatic disease, which is not amenable to surgical resection, resulting in 
poor survival. Adjuvant or definitive radiotherapy, with or without 
chemotherapy, is therefore used in many centers worldwide for better local 
control, and with the expectation that it will have a favorable effect on 
survival. However, the lack of appropriate prospective trials, as well as the 
small size of the published series and their retrospective nature, has produced 
insufficient evidence for the best treatment for these patients. Intraluminal 
brachytherapy is an important component in the multimodality approach to bile 
duct cancers. The objective of this treatment is to deliver a high local dose of 
radiation to the tumor while sparing surrounding healthy tissues. The treatment 
can be safely adapted for right and left hepatic duct, and for common bile duct 
lesions. Brachytherapy plays a limited but specific role in definitive treatment 
with curative intent in selected cases of early disease, as well as in the 
postoperative treatment of small residual disease. Depending on the location of 
the lesion, in some cases, brachytherapy is a treatment of choice. Clinical 
indications, different techniques, results, and complications are discussed in 
this work.

Cancer in older people has become an increasingly common problem due to the 
prolonged life expectancy of the general population. Cancer treatment is 
challenging but it can be more difficult in geriatric population. Aging is 
associated with progressive reduction of the body's functional capacity and 
increased prevalence of chronic diseases. As a result, cancer treatment could 
cause higher prevalence of serious side effects. In the literature there are 
only sparse studies about treatment modalities in geriatric gastric cancer 
patients, therefore our aim was to review the literature concerning this topic 
and reach a sound conclusion.

Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, 610072, People's Republic of China.

PURPOSE: With the increase in life expectancy, the use of laparoscopic surgery 
in elderly patients with colon cancer is gaining interest. The aim of this study 
was to identify the impact of laparoscopic surgery on elderly patients with 
colon cancer in comparison with open surgery. In addition, we evaluated the role 
of surgery in elderly patients with colon cancer by assessing long-term 
outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 203 colon cancer patients 
aged ≥75 years who underwent radical surgery by either laparoscopy or open 
surgery from January 2009 to January 2015. Patient characteristics, short-term 
outcomes, and follow-up data were compared. Radical laparoscopic surgery was 
performed in 109 patients and 94 patients underwent open surgery.
RESULTS: Laparoscopic surgery was accompanied with significantly less blood 
loss, lower analgesic consumption, shorter time to first flatus and soft diet, 
and shorter postoperative hospital stay compared with open surgery. The 5-year 
overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were similar between 
the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that OS and DFS were influenced 
only by TNM stage.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery in older patients for colon cancer can be 
safely performed and maintains the advantage of being minimally invasive.

Aim Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac 
event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and 
the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over 
time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve 
participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness. Methods and results We 
randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac 
rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring 
guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar 
between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group ( p = 0.02). 
Physical fitness improved at discharge ( p < 0.01) and at one-year follow-up ( 
p < 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based 
p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change 
during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). 
Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based 
group (€437 per patient, 95% confidence interval -562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a 
societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of €3160 per 
patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval 
-460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective 
varied between 97% and 75% (willingness-to-pay of €0 and €100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-years, respectively). Conclusion We found no differences 
between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based 
training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality 
of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient 
satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. 
We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as 
an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk 
patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.

The forward skating start is a fundamental skill for male and female ice hockey 
players. However, performance differences by athlete's sex cannot be fully 
explained by physiological variables; hence, other factors such as skating 
technique warrant examination. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the body movement kinematics of ice hockey skating starts between elite 
male and female ice hockey participants. Male (n = 9) and female (n = 10) elite 
ice hockey players performed five forward skating start accelerations. An 
18-camera motion capture system placed on the arena ice surface captured 
full-body kinematics during the first seven skating start steps within 
15 meters. Males' maximum skating speeds were greater than females. Skating 
technique sex differences were noted: in particular, females presented ~10° 
lower hip abduction throughout skating stance as well as ~10° greater knee 
extension at initial ice stance contact, conspicuously followed by a brief 
cessation in knee extension at the moment of ice contact, not evident in male 
skaters. Further study is warranted to explain why these skating technique 
differences exist in relation to factors such as differences in training, 
equipment, performance level, and anthropometrics.
