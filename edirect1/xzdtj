In the future, tuberculosis (TB) will place a heavy burden on the aging 
population in Korea. To prepare for this crisis, it is important to analyze the 
disease burden trend of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) and 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Measuring disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) and economic burden on MDR-TB patients can help reduce the 
incidence of TB. Accordingly, in this study, we measured the DALYs and economic 
burden on DS-TB and MDR-TB patients in 2014-2017 using a combination of National 
Health Insurance claims data, Annual Report on the Notified TB data, and 
Statistics Korea's mortality data. The incidence-based DALY approach implemented 
involved the summation of years of life lost and years lived with disability. 
For measuring economic burden, direct and indirect costs incurred by patients 
were totaled. From 2014 to 2017, DALYs per 100,000 people with DS-TB were 56, 
49, 46, and 40, respectively, and DALYs per 100,000 people with MDR-TB were 3, 
2, 2, and 2, respectively. The economic burden for the DS-TB population from 
2014 to 2017 was $143.89 million, $136.36 million, $122.85 million, and $116.62 
million, respectively, while that for MDR-TB was $413.44 million, $380.25 
million, $376.46 million and $408.14 million, respectively. The results showed a 
decreasing trend in DALYs and economic burden for DS-TB, whereas MDR-TB was 
still found to be burdensome without a specific trend. With respect to age, the 
economic burden for both DS-TB and MDR-TB was higher among men than among women 
till ≤ 79 years. Conversely, the economic burden for women aged ≥80 years was 
higher as compared to their male counterparts. In conclusion, the incidence and 
spread of TB in all areas of society must be suppressed through intensive 
management of MDR-TB in the older population. We hope that the national TB 
management project will proceed efficiently when the infectious disease 
management system is biased to one side due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: Kosovo has the lowest life expectancy in the Balkans. Primary 
healthcare (PHC) plays an essential role in non-communicable disease (NCD) 
prevention. We described primary, secondary and tertiary prevention indicators 
in Kosovo and assessed their association with depressive symptoms.
METHODS: PHC users (n = 977) from the Kosovo NCD cohort baseline study were 
included. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Depressive Anxiety Stress 
Scale-21. Cross-sectional associations between depressive symptoms and 
prevention indicators were quantified with mixed logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Poor nutrition (85%), physical inactivity (70%), obesity (53%), and 
smoking (21%) were common NCD risk factors. Many cases of hypertension (19%), 
diabetes (16%) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (45%) remained 
undetected by a PHC professional. Uncontrolled hypertension (28%), diabetes 
(79%), and COPD (76%) were also common. Depressive symptoms were positively 
associated with physical inactivity (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.05 per 1-point 
increase in DASS-21) and undetected COPD (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.00-1.15), but 
inversely with undetected diabetes (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Continued attention and tailored modifications to primary, 
secondary and tertiary prevention in Kosovo are needed to narrow the Balkan 
health gap.

CONTEXT: Whether biochemical remission normalizes life expectancy in Cushing's 
disease (CD) patients remains unclear. Previous studies evaluating mortality in 
CD are limited by using the expected number of deaths in the background 
population instead of the actual number in matched controls.
OBJECTIVE AND SETTING: To study mortality by time-to-event analysis in an 
unselected nationwide CD patient cohort.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal data from the Swedish Pituitary Register 
of 371 patients diagnosed with CD from 1991 to 2018 and information from the 
Swedish Cause of Death Register were evaluated. Four controls per patient 
(n = 1484) matched at the diagnosis date by age, sex, and residential area were 
included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and causes of death.
RESULTS: The median diagnosis age was 44 years (interquartile range 32-56), and 
the median follow-up was 10.6 years (5.7-18.0). At the 1-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 
20-year follow-ups, the remission rates were 80%, 92%, 96%, 91%, and 97%, 
respectively. Overall mortality was increased in CD patients compared with 
matched controls [hazard ratio (HR) 2.1 (95% CI 1.5-2.8)]. The HRs were 1.5 
(1.02-2.2) for patients in remission at the last follow-up (n = 303), 1.7 
(1.03-2.8) for those in remission after a single pituitary surgery (n = 177), 
and 5.6 (2.7-11.6) for those not in remission (n = 31). Cardiovascular diseases 
(32/66) and infections (12/66) were overrepresented causes of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was increased in CD patients despite biochemical 
remission compared to matched controls. The study highlights the importance of 
careful comorbidity monitoring, regardless of remission status.

With the rapid development of curricula, a large number of studies are emerging 
to assist in the development of curricula. But in an information society, in the 
face of rapid learning and increased life expectancy, students face the pressure 
not to forget; the mental health status as a result of our curricula is closely 
related to our learning. The research and application of the integration 
algorithm plays an important role in the analysis of the mental health education 
system. The purpose of this work is to study the application analysis algorithm 
in the students' context. This work applies the integration analysis algorithm 
to students' mental health analysis and identifies students' mental health 
problems using the integration analysis algorithm so that students are well 
informed and guided. Based on the system engineering method, using the data 
mining clustering method, a detailed analysis and research on the mental health 
of college students is done. In this work, a method of student behavior analysis 
and statistical tools are used to collect mental health data to find common 
features of different groups of students, in order to better visualize and 
investigate the mental health of these students on a scientific basis. The 
results of this study are as follows: a general analysis algorithm application 
on the analysis of students' mental health education system allows for an 
effective understanding of scientific data. FCM and FCM algorithms based on the 
density of information entropy characteristics were used to investigate the 
effect of mental health factors on the results of the study and the practicality 
of the algorithm used, which provided an effective method for the prevention of 
student mental problems. Assisting the school in formulating corresponding new 
methods of early prevention and intervention of college students' psychological 
disorders will create a good and healthy atmosphere for college students' study 
and life. The research results provide a reliable basis for managing and 
cultivating students.

Toe-walking characterizes several neuromuscular conditions and is associated 
with a reduction in gait stability and efficiency, as well as in life quality. 
The optimal choice of treatment depends on a correct understanding of the 
underlying pathology and on the individual biomechanics of walking. The 
objective of this study was to describe gait deviations occurring in a cohort of 
healthy adult subjects when mimicking a unilateral toe-walking pattern compared 
to their normal heel-to-toe gait pattern. The focus was to characterize the 
functional adaptations of the major lower-limb muscles which are required in 
order to toe walk. Musculoskeletal modeling was used to estimate the required 
muscle contributions to the joint sagittal moments. The support moment, defined 
as the sum of the sagittal extensive moments at the ankle, knee, and hip joints, 
was used to evaluate the overall muscular effort necessary to maintain stance 
limb stability and prevent the collapse of the knee. Compared to a normal 
heel-to-toe gait pattern, toe-walking was characterized by significantly 
different lower-limb kinematics and kinetics. The altered kinetic demands at 
each joint translated into different necessary moment contributions from most 
muscles. In particular, an earlier and prolonged ankle plantarflexion 
contribution was required from the soleus and gastrocnemius during most of the 
stance phase. The hip extensors had to provide a higher extensive moment during 
loading response, while a significantly higher knee extension contribution from 
the vasti was necessary during mid-stance. Compensatory muscular activations are 
therefore functionally required at every joint level in order to toe walk. A 
higher support moment during toe-walking indicates an overall higher muscular 
effort necessary to maintain stance limb stability and prevent the collapse of 
the knee. Higher muscular demands during gait may lead to fatigue, pain, and 
reduced quality of life. Toe-walking is indeed associated with significantly 
larger muscle forces exerted by the quadriceps to the patella and prolonged 
force transmission through the Achilles tendon during stance phase. Optimal 
treatment options should therefore account for muscular demands and potential 
overloads associated with specific compensatory mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacist-facilitated medicines review services have been 
postulated as a way to address current inequities in health outcomes between 
Māori and non-Māori. These interventions have been shown internationally to 
improve the appropriate use of medicines but remain underutilised in Aotearoa 
New Zealand (NZ). By reviewing the literature and engaging with key 
stakeholders, we developed an intervention, which included collaborative 
goal-setting, education and medicines optimisation, for testing in a feasibility 
study.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility (recruitment, intervention delivery, and 
data collection methods) of a pharmacist-facilitated medicines review 
intervention for Māori older adults, and proposed intervention outcomes.
METHODS: This study was reported in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement: 
extension to randomised controlled pilot and feasibility trials and the 
Consolidated criteria for strengthening reporting of health research involving 
indigenous peoples: the CONSIDER statement. Participant eligibility criteria 
were: Māori; aged 55-plus; community-dwelling; enrolled in a general practice in 
Waitematā District Health Board (Auckland, NZ). Consented participants engaged 
in a medicines education component (participant and pharmacist) and an optional 
medicines optimisation component (participant, pharmacist and prescriber). 
Outcomes measures included: the feasibility of data collection tools and 
methods, time taken to conduct the intervention and research processes; 
medicines knowledge, medicines appropriateness and quality of life (QoL); 
pharmacist recommendations and prescriber acceptance rate.
RESULTS: Seventeen consented participants took part in the intervention from 
December 2019-March 2020 with the majority (n = 12) recruited through general 
practice mail-outs. Data collection was feasible using the predetermined outcome 
measure tools and was complete for all patient participants. Pharmacist 
intervention delivery was feasible. A mean of 9.5 recommendations were made per 
participant with a prescriber acceptance rate of 95%. These included 
non-medicine-related recommendations.
CONCLUSION: The feasibility testing of pharmacist-facilitated medicines review 
intervention developed for (and with) community-dwelling Māori older adults 
allows for intervention refinement and can be utilised for further studies 
relating to pharmacist services in primary care.

With the recent climate warming, tundra ecotones are facing a progressive 
acceleration of spring snowpack melting and extension of the growing season, 
with evident consequences to vegetation. Along with summer temperature, winter 
precipitation has been recently recognised as a crucial factor for tundra shrub 
growth and physiology. However, gaps of knowledge still exist on long-living 
plant responses to different snowpack duration, especially on how intra-specific 
and year-to-year variability together with multiple functional trait adjustments 
could influence the long-term responses. To fill this gap, we conducted a 3 
years snow manipulation experiment above the Alpine treeline on the typical 
tundra species Juniperus communis, the conifer with the widest distributional 
range in the north emisphere. We tested shoot elongation, leaf area, stomatal 
density, leaf dry weight and leaf non-structural carbohydrate content of plants 
subjected to anticipated, natural and postponed snowpack duration. Anticipated 
snowpack melting enhanced new shoot elongation and increased stomatal density. 
However, plants under prolonged snow cover seemed to compensate for the shorter 
growing period, likely increasing carbon allocation to growth. In fact, these 
latter showed larger needles and low starch content at the beginning of the 
growing season. Variability between treatments slightly decreased over time, 
suggesting a progressive acclimation of juniper to new conditions. In the 
context of future warming scenarios, our results support the hypothesis of shrub 
biomass increase within the tundra biome. Yet, the picture is still far from 
being complete and further research should focus on transient and fading effects 
of changing conditions in the long term.

Stroke severely affects the quality of life, specifically in walking 
independently. Thus, it is crucial to understand the impaired gait pattern. This 
gait pattern has been widely investigated when walking on a level treadmill. 
However, knowledge about the gait pattern when walking on inclines is scarce. 
Therefore, this study attempted to fulfill this knowledge gap. In this study, 15 
stroke survivors and 15 age/height/weight healthy controls were recruited. The 
participants were instructed to walk on three different inclines: 0°, 3°, and 
6°. The participants were required to walk on each incline for 2 min and needed 
to complete each incline two times. The dependent variables were the peak values 
for ankle/knee/hip joint angles and the respective variability of these peak 
values. The results showed that an increment of the incline significantly 
increased the peak of the hip flexion and the peak of the knee flexion but did 
not affect the peak values of the ankle joints in the paretic leg in these 
stroke survivors. In comparison with the healthy controls, lower hip extension, 
lower hip flexion, lower knee flexion, and lower ankle plantar flexion were 
observed in stroke survivors. A clinical application of this work might assist 
the physical therapists in building an effective treadmill training protocol.

Nearly 40% of the advanced cancer patients will present brain metastases during 
the course of their disease, with a 2-year life expectancy of less than 10%. 
Immune system impairment, including the modulation of both STAT3 and PD-L1, is 
one of the hallmarks of brain metastases. Liquid biopsy could offer several 
advantages in brain metastases management, such as the possibility of 
noninvasive dynamic monitoring. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recently 
proposed as novel biomarkers especially useful in liquid biopsy due to their 
secretion in biofluids and their role in cell communication during tumor 
progression. The main aim of this work was to characterize the size and protein 
cargo of plasma circulating EVs in patients with solid tumors and their 
correlation with newly diagnosed brain metastases, in addition to their 
association with other relevant clinical variables. We analyzed circulating EVs 
in the plasma of 123 patients: 42 patients with brain metastases, 50 without 
brain metastases and 31 healthy controls. Patients with newly diagnosed brain 
metastases had a lower number of circulating EVs in the plasma and a higher 
protein concentration in small EVs (sEVs) compared to patients without brain 
metastases and healthy controls. Interestingly, melanoma patients with brain 
metastases presented decreased STAT3 activation and increased PD-L1 levels in 
circulating sEVs compared to patients without central nervous system metastases. 
Decreased STAT3 activation and increased PD-L1 in plasma circulating sEVs 
identify melanoma patients with brain metastasis.

Ribeiro Asa Norte, Brasilia, Brazil.

As a form of functional diversity, spinal cord injury expressed by tetraplegia 
is one of the most serious events that can impact people, affecting their family 
and socioeconomic life. The type of care relationship established in these cases 
will be essential for preserving autonomy. The objective of this study was to 
understand how care relationships influence the autonomy of people with 
tetraplegia and the dynamics that trigger practices of autonomy violation, 
maintenance and promotion. This research is inspired by problematization as a 
methodology using the Arch of Maguerez as an analytical approach strategy that 
enables an engagement between empirical and theoretical data. Some models of 
care relationships identified in this study either promote or violate autonomy: 
the protectionist model, based on the biomedical interpretation model of 
disability and the bodily impediments caused by spinal cord injury; the 
participatory model, involving the patient's interest in adapting to their new 
condition of family and community life, seeking to understand the practical 
aspects of daily life; the sharing model, in which the complicity and 
understanding of new forms of bodily expression allow the caregiver to be almost 
an extension of the tetraplegic person's body; the delegate model, which occurs 
in relationships with professional caregivers; and the emancipatory model, which 
seeks to empower the patient, highlight potentialities, and encourage autonomy. 
The key components of these conceptual care models guided the elaboration of 
hypotheses for intervention with the objective of maintaining and promoting the 
autonomy of people with tetraplegia through supported care.

The molecular mechanisms of aging and life expectancy have been studied in model 
organisms with short lifespans. However, long-lived species may provide insights 
into successful strategies for healthy aging, potentially opening the door for 
novel therapeutic interventions in age-related diseases. Notably, naked 
mole-rats, the longest-lived rodent, present attenuated aging phenotypes 
compared with mice. Their resistance toward oxidative stress has been proposed 
as one hallmark of their healthy aging, suggesting their ability to maintain 
cell homeostasis, specifically their protein homeostasis. To identify the 
general principles behind their protein homeostasis robustness, we compared the 
aggregation propensity and mutation tolerance of naked mole-rat and mouse 
orthologous proteins. Our analysis showed no proteome-wide differential effects 
in aggregation propensity and mutation tolerance between these species, but 
several subsets of proteins with a significant difference in aggregation 
propensity. We found an enrichment of proteins with higher aggregation 
propensity in naked mole-rat, and these are functionally involved in the 
inflammasome complex and nucleic acid binding. On the other hand, proteins with 
lower aggregation propensity in naked mole-rat have a significantly higher 
mutation tolerance compared with the rest of the proteins. Among them, we 
identified proteins known to be associated with neurodegenerative and 
age-related diseases. These findings highlight the intriguing hypothesis about 
the capacity of the naked mole-rat proteome to delay aging through its proteomic 
intrinsic architecture.

OBJECTIVES: Abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MRI) was introduced to reduce both 
examination and image reading times and to improve cost-effectiveness of breast 
cancer screening. The aim of this model-based economic study was to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness of full protocol breast MRI (FB-MRI) vs. AB-MRI in screening 
women with dense breast tissue for breast cancer.
METHODS: Decision analysis and a Markov model were designed to model the 
cumulative costs and effects of biennial screening in terms of quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) from a US healthcare system perspective. Model input 
parameters for a cohort of women with dense breast tissue were adopted from 
recent literature. The impact of varying AB-MRI costs per examination as well as 
specificity on the resulting cost-effectiveness was modeled within deterministic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: At an assumed cost per examination of $ 263 for AB-MRI (84% of the cost 
of a FB-MRI examination), the discounted cumulative costs of both MR-based 
strategies accounted comparably. Reducing the costs of AB-MRI below $ 259 (82% 
of the cost of a FB-MRI examination, respectively), the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of FB-MRI exceeded the willingness to pay threshold and 
the AB-MRI-strategy should be considered preferable in terms of 
cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings indicate that AB-MRI may be considered 
cost-effective compared to FB-MRI for screening women with dense breast tissue 
for breast cancer, as long as the costs per examination do not exceed 82% of the 
cost of a FB-MRI examination.
KEY POINTS: • Cost-effectiveness of abbreviated breast MRI is affected by 
reductions in specificity and resulting false positive findings and increased 
recall rates. • Abbreviated breast MRI may be cost-effective up to a cost per 
examination of 82% of the cost of a full protocol examination. • Abbreviated 
breast MRI could be an economically preferable alternative to full protocol 
breast MRI in screening women with dense breast tissue.

pH-dependent antigen binding has proven useful in engineering next-generation 
therapeutics specifically via antibody recycling technology. This technology 
allows for half-life extension, thereby lowering the amount and frequency of 
dosing of therapeutics. Cell sorting, coupled with display techniques, has been 
used extensively for the selection of high-affinity binders. Herein, we describe 
a cell sorting methodology utilizing yeast surface display for selection of 
binding proteins with strong binding at physiological pH and weak to no binding 
at acidic pH. This methodology can be readily applied to engineer proteins 
and/or antibodies that do not have pH-dependent binding or for selection of de 
novo pH-dependent binders using library-based methods.

Adolescents are tasked with navigating competing priorities, including whether 
to marry, have children, pursue a job/career, go to college, and contribute to 
society. The developmental task of building expectations for the future is 
especially complex for Cambodian adolescents living within a society that 
strongly prioritizes family obligations yet increasingly provides educational 
and professional opportunities. The current study, guided by Seginer's (2003) 
future orientation model, applied latent profile analysis (LPA) to explore 
patterns of Cambodian adolescents' (N = 580, 64% female, Mage = 15.85) future 
expectations across key life domains and predictors of those patterns. LPA 
identified four profiles: Low Expectancy (low expectations across all domains; 
12%), Family Focused (high expectations to get married and have children; 31%), 
Professional/Service Focused (high expectations across education, employment, 
and societal contribution domains; 27%), and High Expectancy (high expectations 
across all domains; 30%). Females were more likely than males to be in the 
Professional/Service Focused than High Expectancy profile. Adolescents with 
greater internal locus of control and family obligation were less likely to be 
in the Low Expectancy and Family Focused than High Expectancy profile, whereas 
adolescents in higher grade levels were more likely to be in the Family Focused 
than High Expectancy profile. Adolescents with closer relationships with mothers 
were less likely to be in the Professional/Service Focused than High Expectancy 
profile; adolescents with closer relationships with fathers were more likely to 
be in the Professional/Service Focused than High and Low Expectancy profiles. 
Findings elucidate configurations of adolescents' future expectations, and 
factors distinguishing among adolescents with different configurations.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) describes heterogeneous population of patients with 
a mean pulmonary arterial pressure >20 mm Hg. Rarely, PH presents as a primary 
disorder but is more commonly part of a complex phenotype associated with 
comorbidities. Regardless of the cause, PH reduces life expectancy and impacts 
quality of life. The current clinical classification divides PH into 1 of 5 
diagnostic groups to assign treatment. There are currently no pharmacological 
cures for any form of PH. Animal models are essential to help decipher the 
molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, to assign genotype-phenotype 
relationships to help identify new therapeutic targets, and for clinical 
translation to assess the mechanism of action and putative efficacy of new 
therapies. However, limitations inherent of all animal models of disease limit 
the ability of any single model to fully recapitulate complex human disease. 
Within the PH community, we are often critical of animal models due to the 
perceived low success upon clinical translation of new drugs. In this review, we 
describe the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of existing animal 
models developed to gain insight into the molecular and pathological mechanisms 
and test new therapeutics, focusing on adult forms of PH from groups 1 to 3. We 
also discuss areas of improvement for animal models with approaches combining 
several hits to better reflect the clinical situation and elevate their 
translational value.

Cholera is a life-threatening diarrheal disease caused by the human pathogenic 
bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Regulatory elements are essential for bacterial 
transition between the natural aquatic environment and the human host. One of 
them is the alternative sigma factor RpoS and its anti-sigma factor RssB. 
Regulation principles seem to be conserved among RpoS/RssB interaction modes 
between V. cholerae and Enterobacteriaceae species, however the associated input 
and output pathways seem different. In Escherichia coli, RpoS/RssB is important 
for the activation of an emergency program to increase persistence and survival. 
Whereas, it activates motility and chemotaxis in V. cholerae, used strategically 
to escape from starvation conditions. We characterised a starvation-induced 
interaction model showing a negative feedback loop between RpoS and RssB 
expression. We showed by genotypic and phenotypic analysis that rssB influences 
motility, growth behaviour, colonization fitness, and post-infectious survival. 
Furthermore, we found that RssB itself is a substrate for proteolysis and a 
critical Asp mutation was identified and characterised to influence rssB 
phenotypes and their interaction with RpoS. In summary, we present novel 
information about the regulatory interaction between RpoS and RssB being active 
under in vivo colonization conditions and mark an extension to the feedback 
regulation circuit, showing that RssB is a substrate for proteolysis.

OBJECTIVES: Recently, updated data from KEYNOTE-048 revealed that pembrolizumab 
with or without chemotherapy could improve progression-free survival (PFS)2 
compared with cetuximab plus chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov structure was conducted to evaluate the cost and 
effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
vs. cetuximab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of recurrent or 
metastatic HNSCC from the United States payer's perspective. Total cost, health 
outcomes, and incremental cost-effective ratios (ICERs) were estimated. 
Additional analyses were conducted in the total population and in two different 
programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive scores (CPSs) (≥1 
and ≥ 20) population. Sensitivity analysis were used to test the stability of 
the model.
RESULTS: When compared with cetuximab plus chemotherapy, the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy strategy was dominated by lower cost and better efficacy in all 
three populations. The incremental costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) 
yielded by pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with cetuximab plus 
chemotherapy were $16016.88 and 0.11 in the total population, and $24467.47 and 
0.18 and $30448.46 and 0.20 in the populations with a PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 and 
CPS ≥ 20, respectively, leading to ICERs of $147876.14, $134237.84, and 
$153660.78 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy are cost-effective strategies compared with cetuximab plus 
chemotherapy when the value of willingness-to-pay (WTP) was $150000 per QALY for 
the total and PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 populations with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.

Shifts in wellbeing and health occur as we age. As life expectancy increases, 
maintenance of wellbeing and health becomes increasingly important. Nutrients 
found in beef are associated with outcomes of wellbeing such as physical and 
cognitive function, lean body mass, and mood in older adults and individuals 
with chronic disease. However, it is unclear how beef and nutrients found in 
beef impact wellbeing in healthy adults ≥50 years of age. This study 
systematically reviewed evidence linking the intake of beef and nutrients found 
in beef to markers of wellbeing in healthy adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of 
Science were searched up to August 31, 2021 for eligible randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs). Nutrients included in the analysis were beef, red meat, dietary 
protein, essential amino acids, branched chain amino acids, tryptophan, 
arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, zinc, 
and iron. We identified nine RCTs with results from 55 measurements of markers 
of wellbeing. An overall positive effect was found of beef and beef's nutrients 
on wellbeing. There was an overall positive effect of amino acids and protein on 
wellbeing, with no effect of arginine, vitamin B-12, leucine, and zinc. Physical 
function was also influenced by beef and nutrients found in beef. Eight of the 
studies found focused on specific nutrients found in beef, and not beef itself 
in older adults with one or more chronic diseases. This study identified a need 
for further research regarding the effect of beef and nutrients found in beef on 
defined functional outcomes of wellbeing in healthy adults ≥50 years of age.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative, progressive disorder 
conditioned by a mutation in the HTT gene. Its progression is dependent on the 
causative mutation extension. Caregivers of individuals affected by HD, most 
often patients' relatives, are burdened with the care. This study aims to assess 
the caregivers' burden cross-sectionally and longitudinally and look for 
biological and clinical patients-related burdening factors. In total, 144 
caregiver-patient pairs observed annually for up to 8 years were included in the 
study. In all of the patients, demographic data were collected, Unified 
Huntington&amp;apos;s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) assessments were conducted, 
and disease burden (DB) was calculated when caregivers were assessed in 
Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI). Caregivers' burden measured in CBI at the 
first visit reached 18.7 ± 18.4 scores. Longitudinal observation showed no 
evidence for any discrepancy between clinical progression measured in UHDRS, nor 
biological progression measured in DB and the caregivers' burden progression 
measured in CBI. Caregivers were burdened mostly by patients' dependence and a 
discrepancy between reality and life expectations. This study indicates factors 
to be addressed to reduce caregivers' burden. Strict relation between 
caregivers' burden and biological and clinical progression denies conception of 
overloaded with care tasks or adaptation to the burden.
