INTRODUCTION: Many patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) present with acute 
exacerbations needing hospital admission. Treatment includes intravenous 
steroids but up to 40% of patients do not respond and require emergency 
colectomy. Mortality following emergency colectomy has fallen, but 10% of 
patients still die within 3 months of surgery. Infliximab and ciclosporin, both 
immunosuppressive drugs, offer hope for treating steroid-resistant UC as there 
is evidence of their short-term effectiveness. As there is little long-term 
evidence, this pragmatic randomised trial, known as Comparison Of iNfliximab and 
ciclosporin in STeroid Resistant Ulcerative Colitis: a Trial (CONSTRUCT), aims 
to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of infliximab and ciclosporin for 
steroid-resistant UC.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Between May 2010 and February 2013, 52 UK centres 
recruited 270 patients admitted with acute severe UC who failed to respond to 
intravenous steroids but did not need surgery. We allocated them at random in 
equal proportions between infliximab and ciclosporin.The primary clinical 
outcome measure is quality-adjusted survival, that is survival weighted by 
Crohn's and Colitis Questionnaire (CCQ) participants' scores, analysed by Cox 
regression. Secondary outcome measures include: the CCQ-an extension of the 
validated but community-focused UK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire 
(IBDQ) to include patients with acute severe colitis and stoma; two general 
quality of life measures-EQ-5D and SF-12; mortality; survival weighted by EQ-5D; 
emergency and planned colectomies; readmissions; incidence of adverse events 
including malignancies, serious infections and renal disorders; disease 
activity; National Health Service (NHS) costs and patient-borne costs. 
Interviews investigate participants' views on therapies for acute severe UC and 
healthcare professionals' views on the two drugs and their administration.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Research Ethics Committee for Wales has given 
ethical approval (Ref. 08/MRE09/42); each participating Trust or Health Board 
has given NHS Reseach & Development approval. We plan to present trial findings 
at international and national conferences and publish in high-impact 
peer-reviewed journals.

OBJECT: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis is critical to the efficient 
allocation of health care resources; however, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for adult spinal deformity 
(ASD) has eluded the literature, due in part to inherent empirical difficulties 
when comparing surgical and nonsurgical patients. Using observed preoperative 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients who later underwent surgery, 
this study builds a statistical model to predict hypothetical quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) without surgical treatment. The analysis compares predicted 
QALYs to observed postoperative QALYs and forms the resulting ICER.
METHODS: This was a single-center (Baylor Scoliosis Center) retrospective 
analysis of consecutive patients undergoing primary surgery for ASD. Total costs 
(expressed in 2010 dollars) incurred by the hospital for each episode of 
surgical care were collected from administrative data and QALYs were calculated 
from the 6-dimensional Short-Form Health Survey, each discounted at 3.5% per 
year. Regression analysis was used to predict hypothetical QALYs without surgery 
based on preoperative longitudinal data for 124 crossover surgical patients with 
similar diagnoses, baseline HRQOL, age, and sex compared with the surgical 
cohort. Results were projected through 10-year follow-up, and the 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) was estimated using nonparametric 
bootstrap methods.
RESULTS: Three-year follow-up was available for 120 (66%) of 181 eligible 
patients, who were predominantly female (89%) with average age of 50. With 
discounting, total costs averaged $125,407, including readmissions, with average 
QALYs of 1.93 at 3-year follow-up. Average QALYs without surgery were predicted 
to be 1.6 after 3 years. At 3- and 5-year follow-up, the ICER was $375,000 and 
$198,000, respectively. Projecting through 10-year follow-up, the ICER was 
$80,000. The 10-year CEAC revealed a 40% probability that the ICER was $80,000 
or less, a 90% probability that the ICER was $90,000 or less, and a 100% 
probability that the ICER was less than $100,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the WHO's suggested upper threshold for cost-effectiveness 
(3 times per capita GDP, or $140,000 in 2010 dollars), the analysis reveals that 
surgical treatment for ASD is cost-effective after a 10-year period based on 
predicted deterioration in HRQOL without surgery. The ICER well exceeds the WHO 
threshold at earlier follow-up intervals, highlighting the importance of the 
durability of surgical treatment in assessing the value of surgical 
intervention. Due to the study's methodology, the results are dependent on the 
predicted deterioration in HRQOL without surgery. As such, the results may not 
extend to patients whose HRQOL would remain steady without surgery. Future 
research should therefore pursue a direct comparison of QALYs for surgical and 
nonsurgical patients to better understand the cost-effectiveness of surgery for 
the average ASD patient.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of testing pregnant women with 
hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive) for hepatitis B e 
antigen (HBeAg) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and administering maternal 
antiviral prophylaxis if indicated, to decrease breakthrough perinatal HBV 
transmission from the U.S. health care perspective.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed for a 2010 birth cohort of 4 
million neonates to estimate the cost-effectiveness of two strategies: testing 
HBsAg-positive pregnant women for 1) HBeAg or 2) HBV load. Maternal antiviral 
prophylaxis is given from 28 weeks of gestation through 4 weeks postpartum when 
HBeAg is positive or HBV load is high (10 copies/mL or greater). These 
strategies were compared with the current recommendation. All neonates born to 
HBsAg-positive women received recommended active-passive immunoprophylaxis. 
Effects were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and all costs were 
in 2010 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: The HBeAg testing strategy saved $3.3 million and 3,080 QALYs and 
prevented 486 chronic HBV infections compared with the current recommendation. 
The HBV load testing strategy cost $3 million more than current recommendation, 
saved 2,080 QALYs, and prevented 324 chronic infections with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,583 per QALY saved compared with the current 
recommendations. The results remained robust over a wide range of assumptions.
CONCLUSION: Testing HBsAg-positive pregnant women for HBeAg or HBV load followed 
by maternal antiviral prophylaxis if HBeAg-positive or high viral load to reduce 
perinatal hepatitis B transmission in the United States is cost-effective.

Cationic liposomes are broadly used as non-viral vectors to deliver genetic 
materials that can be used to treat various diseases including cancer. To 
circumvent problems associated with cationic liposome-mediated delivery systems 
such as low transfection efficiency and serum-induced inhibition, 
cholesterol-based cationic lipids have been synthesized that resist the effects 
of serum. The introduction of an ether-type linkage and extension of the 
aminopropyl head group on the cholesterol backbone increased the transfection 
efficiency and DNA binding affinity compared to a carbamoyl-type linkage and a 
mono aminopropyl head group, respectively. Under optimal conditions, each 
liposome formulation showed higher transfection efficiency in AGS and Huh-7 
cells than commercially available cationic liposomes, particularly in the 
presence of serum. The following molecular structures were found to have a 
positive effect on transfection properties: (i) extended aminopropyl head groups 
for a strong binding affinity to plasmid DNA; (ii) an ether linkage that favors 
electrostatic binding to plasmid DNA; and (iii) a cholesterol backbone for serum 
resistance.

Highly sensitive electrochemical aptasensor based on a ligase-assisted 
exonuclease III-catalyzed degradation reaction.

In this paper, we have proposed a new electrochemical aptasensor based on a 
novel ligase-assisted Exo III-catalyzed degradation reaction (LAECDR), which 
consists of DNA ligase-catalyzed ligation of thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) with 
an extension strand (E-strand) and Exo III-catalyzed selective degradation of 
probe DNA, by using an improved target-induced strand displacement strategy. As 
a result of LAECDR, methylene blue (MB)-labeled mononucleotides can be released 
from the 3'-terminal of probe DNA and captured by cucurbit[7]uril-functionalized 
electrode to induce noticeable electrochemical response. Nevertheless, in the 
presence of the target protein, thrombin, the TBA that is partially 
complementary to probe DNA is preferentially binding with the target protein, 
thereby inhibiting LAECDR from taking place. The remaining intact probe DNA will 
prevent the terminal-attached MB from approaching to the electrode surface due 
to strong electrostatic repulsion, so the electrochemical response will be 
changed by thrombin. By tracing the electrochemical response of adsorbed MB, our 
aptasensor can exhibit high sensitivity for thrombin detection with a wide 
linear range from 100 fM to 1 nM and an extremely low detection limit of 33 fM, 
which can also easily distinguish thrombin in the complex serum samples with 
high specificity. Therefore, our aptasensor might have great potential in 
clinical applications in the future.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the burden of a disease implies the simultaneous 
quantification of the impact of early mortality and the health problems that 
affect the individual's quality of life, and this evaluation can be particularly 
important in a disease such as AIDS that has become a long-term disease. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the burden of disease due to AIDS in the 
Brazilian Southern State of Santa Catarina.
METHODS: An ecological designed study was performed using death and AIDS 
notifications data for 2009. The disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were 
estimated by the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and the years lived with 
disability (YLD). The YLL was estimated as the difference between the life 
expectancy from birth and the age at death with the application of a discount 
rate of 3% per year. The YLD was estimated as the product of the Burden of 
Disease Study's weight for AIDS of 0.167 and its average duration of 108 months 
in Brazil for the incident cases. The YLL, YLD and DALY rates were calculated 
per 100,000 inhabitants by sex and age groups.
RESULTS: There were 2034 notified cases and 689 deaths due to AIDS reported. 
There were 15,756.5 YLLs estimated, resulting in 257.5 YLLs/100,000 inhabitants, 
and 4554.1 YLDs were estimated, resulting in 74.4 YLDs/100,000 inhabitants. The 
DALY was estimated at 20,310.6, with a rate of 331.9 DALYs/100,000 inhabitants. 
The highest rates were observed in males in the age groups 30-44 and 45-59 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of AIDS was high and was observed mainly in adults, with 
a predominance in males.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relationship between operative care for 
breast cancer at for-profit hospitals and subsequent use of adjuvant radiation 
therapy (RT). Among Medicare beneficiaries, we examined whether hospital 
ownership status is associated with the use of breast brachytherapy--a newer and 
more expensive modality--as well as overall RT.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of female Medicare beneficiaries who 
received breast-conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer in 2008 and 2009. 
We assessed the relationship between hospital ownership and receipt of 
brachytherapy or overall RT by using hierarchical generalized linear models.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 35,118 women, 8.0% of whom had 
breast-conserving operations at for-profit hospitals. Among patients who 
received RT, those who underwent operation at for-profit hospitals were more 
likely to receive brachytherapy (20.2%) than patients treated at not-for-profit 
hospitals (15.2%; odds ratio [OR] for for-profit versus not-for-profit: 1.50; 
95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.23-1.84; P < .001). Among women aged 66-79 
years, there was no relationship between hospital ownership status and overall 
use of RT. Among women ages 80-94 years of age--the group least likely to 
benefit from RT due to shorter life expectancy--undergoing breast-conserving 
operations at a for-profit hospital was associated with greater overall use of 
RT (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.45, P = .03) and brachytherapy use (OR 1.66; 95% CI 
1.18-2.34, P = .003).
CONCLUSION: Operative care at for-profit hospitals was associated with increased 
use of the newer and more expensive RT modality, brachytherapy. Among the oldest 
women who are least likely to benefit from RT, operative care at a for-profit 
hospital was associated with greater overall use of RT, with this difference 
largely driven by the use of brachytherapy.

PURPOSE: To assess the impact on visual function of community glaucoma screening 
in an African American population using spectral-domain optical coherence 
tomography (SD-OCT).
METHODS: Using a Monte Carlo microsimulation model with a 10-year time horizon, 
we analyzed the efficacy of SD-OCT screening on visual field outcomes in a 
population of African Americans who are not otherwise seeking office-based care. 
Outcomes included classification of visual field severity, quality-adjusted life 
years, and direct health care costs.
RESULTS: Assuming a 60% follow-up rate, screening decreased the prevalence of 
undiagnosed glaucoma from 75% to 38%, and decreased the prevalence of severe 
visual field loss in patients with glaucoma from 29.1% to 23.9%. Conversely, 
screening increased the prevalence of mild visual field loss in patients with 
glaucoma from 9.2% to 18.7%. From initial screening through confirmatory eye 
examination, the screening program ("screen only") cost $98 per screened 
individual, and $2561 per new diagnosis of glaucoma. When considering the costs 
of initial screening though the resultant treatment, the screening program 
("screen and treat") had an average annual cost of $79 and $2138, respectively, 
over a 10-year time period. The cost of one quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained by screening, including management and treatment, in comparison with 
opportunistic case finding, ranged from $46,416 to $67,813.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that community SD-OCT screening in an African 
American population will minimize glaucoma-related visual morbidity. Ideally, 
strategies to maximize treatment efficacy through improved medication adherence 
and improved compliance with follow-up should be identified and implemented 
before instituting a screening program.

Drug pricing and control of health expenditures: a comparison between a 
proportional decision rule and a cost-per-QALY rule.

Gandjour A(1).

Author information:
(1)Frankfurt School of Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Germany, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in 
Health Care (IQWiG) makes recommendations for reimbursement prices of drugs on 
the basis of a proportional relationship between costs and health benefits. This 
paper analyzed the potential of IQWiG's decision rule to control health 
expenditures and used a cost-per-quality-adjusted life year (QALY) rule as a 
comparison.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted, and a theoretical model of health 
expenditure growth was built.
RESULTS: The literature search shows that the median incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of German cost-effectiveness analyses was â¬7650 per 
QALY gained, thus yielding a much lower threshold cost-effectiveness ratio for 
IQWiG's rule than an absolute rule at â¬30â000 per QALY. The theoretical model 
shows that IQWiG's rule is able to contain the long-term growth of health 
expenditures under the conservative assumption that future health increases at a 
constant absolute rate and that the threshold incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio increases at a smaller rate than health expenditures. In contrast, an 
absolute rule offers the potential for manufacturers to raise drug prices in 
response to the threshold, thus resulting in an initial spike in expenditures.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that IQWiG's proportional rule will lead to lower 
drug prices and a slower growth of health expenditures than an absolute 
cost-effectiveness threshold at â¬30â000 per QALY. This finding is surprising as 
IQWiG's rule-in contrast to a cost-per-QALY rule-does not start from a fixed 
budget.

Gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding are serious complications of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Although administration of antibiotics and 
Toll-like receptor 4 knockdown mitigate NSAID-induced enteropathy, the molecular 
mechanism of these effects is poorly understood. Intestinal hyperpermeability is 
speculated to trigger the initial damage due to NSAID use. Transient receptor 
potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a nonselective cation channel expressed 
throughout the gastrointestinal tract epithelium that is activated by 
temperature, extension, and chemicals such as 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid 
(5,6-EET). The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of TRPV4 
in NSAID-induced intestinal damage. TRPV4 mRNA and protein expression was 
confirmed by RT-PCR and immunochemistry, respectively, in mouse and human 
tissues while TRPV4 channel activity of the intestinal cell line IEC-6 was 
assessed by Ca(2+)-imaging analysis. TRPV4 activators or the NSAID indomethacin 
significantly decreased transepithelial resistance (TER) in IEC-6 cells, and 
indomethacin-induced TER decreases were inhibited by specific TRPV4 inhibitors 
or small-interfering RNA TRPV4 knockdown, as well as by the epoxygenase 
inhibitor N-(methylsulfonyl)-2-(2-propynyloxy)-benzenehexanamide, which 
decreased 5,6-EET levels. In TRPV4 knockout mice, indomethacin-induced 
intestinal damage was significantly reduced compared with WT mice. Taken 
together, these results show that TRPV4 activation in the intestinal epithelium 
caused epithelial hyperpermeability in response to NSAID-induced arachidonic 
acid metabolites and contributed to NSAID-induced intestinal damage. Thus, TRPV4 
could be a promising new therapeutic target for the prevention of NSAID-induced 
intestinal damage.

Patients with hemophilia because of limited lifespan rarely undergo cardiac 
surgery. Due to improved healthcare and management in these patients, the life 
expectancy is increasing. Nevertheless, surgical intervention is a new challenge 
in patients with hemophilia, particularly very old patients. We describe an old 
patient with hemophilia A, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.

Annual MRI and mammography is recommended for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers to 
reduce breast cancer mortality. Less intensive screening is advised â¥60 years, 
although effectiveness is unknown. We identified BRCA1/2 mutation carriers 
without bilateral mastectomy before age 60 to determine for whom screening â¥60 
is relevant, in the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic and HEBON: a nationwide 
prospective cohort study. Furthermore, we compared tumour stage at breast cancer 
diagnosis between different screening strategies in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers 
â¥60. Tumours >2 cm, positive lymph nodes, or distant metastases at detection 
were defined as "unfavourable." Of 548 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers â¥60 years in 
2012, 395 (72%) did not have bilateral mastectomy before the age of 60. Of these 
395, 224 (57%) had a history of breast or other invasive carcinoma. In 136 
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, we compared 148 breast cancers (including interval 
cancers) detected â¥60, of which 84 (57%) were first breast cancers. With 
biennial mammography 53% (30/57) of carcinomas were detected in unfavourable 
stage, compared to 21% (12/56) with annual mammography (adjusted odds ratio: 
4Â·07, 95% confidence interval [1.79-9.28], pâ=â0.001). With biennial screening 
40% of breast cancers were interval cancers, compared to 20% with annual 
screening (pâ=â0.016). Results remained significant for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation 
carriers, and first breast cancers separately. Over 70% of 60-year old BRCA1/2 
mutation carriers remain at risk for breast cancer, of which half has prior 
cancers. When life expectancy is good, continuation of annual breast cancer 
screening of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers â¥60 is worthwhile.

PET has been used to examine changes in neurotransmitter concentrations in the 
living brain. Pioneering PET studies on the dopamine system have used D2 and D3 
receptor (D2/D3) antagonists such as (11)C-raclopride. However, more recently 
developed agonist radioligands have shown enhanced sensitivity to endogenous 
dopamine. A limitation of available agonist radioligands is that they 
incorporate the short-lived radioisotope (11)C. In the current study, we 
developed the (18)F-labeled D2/D3 receptor agonist 
(R)-(-)-2-(18)F-fluoroethoxy-N-n-propylnorapomorphine ((18)F-MCL-524).
METHODS: In total, 10 PET measurements were conducted on 5 cynomolgus monkeys. 
Initially, the binding of (18)F-MCL-524 was compared with that of (11)C-MNPA in 
3 monkeys. Second, the specificity of (18)F-MCL-524 binding was examined in 
pretreatment studies using raclopride (1.0 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg). 
Third, a preliminary kinetic analysis was performed using the 
radiometabolite-corrected arterial input function of the baseline studies. 
Finally, 2 whole-body PET measurements were conducted to evaluate 
biodistribution and radiation dosimetry after intravenous injection of 
(18)F-MCL-524.
RESULTS: (18)F-MCL-524 entered the brain and provided striatum-to-cerebellum 
ratios suitable for reliable quantification of receptor binding using the 
multilinear reference tissue model. Mean striatal nondisplaceable binding 
potential (BPND) values were 2.0 after injection of (18)F-MCL-524 and 1.4 after 
(11)C-MNPA. The ratio of the BPND values of (18)F-MCL-524 and (11)C-MNPA was 1.5 
across striatal subregions. After administration of raclopride and 
d-amphetamine, the (18)F-MCL-524 BPND values were reduced by 89% and 56%, 
respectively. Preliminary kinetic analysis demonstrated that BPND values 
obtained with the 1-tissue- and 2-tissue-compartment models were similar to 
values obtained with the multilinear reference tissue model. Estimated radiation 
doses were highest for gallbladder (0.27 mSv/MBq), upper large intestine (0.19 
mSv/MBq), and small intestine (0.17 mSv/MBq). The estimated effective dose was 
0.035 mSv/MBq.
CONCLUSION: The (18)F-labeled agonist (18)F-MCL-524 appears suitable for 
quantification of D2/D3 receptor binding in vivo, and the results encourage 
extension to human studies. The longer half-life of (18)F makes (18)F-MCL-524 
attractive for studies on modulation of the dopamine concentration-for example, 
in combination with simultaneous measurement of changes in 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal using bimodal PET/functional MRI.

Epilepsy in the elderly: Special considerations and challenges.

Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.

The elderly are generally defined as those over 60 or 65 years old, but they are 
a heterogeneous group and may be subdivided into categories based on age and 
health status. The incidence of epilepsy is highest in the elderly. With a 
progressive increase in life expectancy, this is the fastest growing segment of 
patients with epilepsy. Older patients most often have focal seizures, with less 
prominent auras and automatisms, and longer duration of postictal confusion 
compared to younger patients. Status epilepticus is common and has a high 
mortality. The most common specific etiology is cerebrovascular disease, but the 
cause remains unknown in many patients. Diagnosis can be challenging because of 
several patient-related, physician-related and investigation-related factors. 
Over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis are common. Treatment is complicated by the 
presence of physiological changes related to aging, co-morbidities and cognitive 
problems as well as concerns regarding drug interactions and medication 
adherence. Seizures can be controlled in most patients with low doses of a 
single anti-epileptic drug (AED). Tolerability is an important factor in 
selection of an AED, as elderly patients tend to be highly sensitive to side 
effects. Drug-resistant epilepsy is uncommon. Epilepsy surgery, especially 
temporal lobectomy, can be performed in older patients with good results. More 
studies addressing the pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy in this age 
group, and greater inclusion of the elderly in clinical trials, as well as 
development of comprehensive care models are needed to provide optimal care to 
these patients.

Rotifers as models for the biology of aging.

Snell TW(1).

30332-0230, USA.

It has been two decades since 1993 when research on the biology of rotifer aging 
was last reviewed by Enesco. Much has transpired during this time as rotifer 
biologists have adapted to the "omics" revolution and incorporated these 
techniques into the experimental analysis of rotifers. Rotifers are amenable to 
many of these approaches and getting adequate quantities of DNA, RNA, and 
protein from rotifers is not difficult. Analysis of rotifer genomes, 
transcriptomes, and proteomes is rapidly yielding candidate genes that likely 
regulate a variety of features of rotifer biology. Parallel developments in 
aging biology have recognized the limitations of standard animal models like 
worms and flies and that comparative aging research has essentially ignored a 
large fraction of animal phylogeny in the lophotrochozoans. As experimentally 
tractable members of this group, rotifers have attracted interest as models of 
aging. In this paper, I review advances over the past 20 years in the biology of 
aging in rotifers, with emphasis on the unique contributions of rotifer models 
for understanding aging. The majority of experimental work has manipulated 
rotifer diet and followed changes in survival and reproductive dynamics like 
mean lifespan, maximum lifespan, reproductive lifespan, and mortality rate 
doubling time. The main dietary manipulation has been some form of caloric 
restriction, withholding food for some period or feeding continuously at low 
levels. There have been comparative studies of several rotifer species, with 
some species responding to caloric restriction with life extension, but others 
not, at least under the tested food regimens. Other aspects of diet are less 
explored, like nutritional properties of different algae species and their 
capacity to extend rotifer lifespan. Several descriptive studies have reported 
many genes involved in rotifer aging by comparing gene expression in young and 
old individuals. Classes of genes up or down-regulated during aging have become 
prime targets for rotifer aging investigations. Alterations of gene expression 
by exposure to specific inhibitors or RNAi knockdown will probably yield 
valuable insights into the cellular mechanisms of rotifer life extension. I 
highlight major experimental contributions in each of these areas and indicate 
opportunities where I believe additional investigation is likely to be 
profitable.

Obesity and metabolic syndrome in association with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes are significant problems that 
contribute to lower life expectancy of patients with schizophrenia. 
Understanding the pharmacological mechanisms of the current antipsychotic 
treatment is clearly the key to the improvement of pharmacotherapy, to avoid or 
to mitigate the metabolic adverse effects.

[The transition of palliative care from the hospital to the ambulatory care of 
the general practitioner: the experience in the canton of Fribourg].

[Article in French]

Zimmermann A, Cantin B, Fournier F, Betticher D.

Thanks to medical progress, the life expectancy of a majority of severely ill 
patients has greatly improved. The fact that these patients will live longer 
with their disease encourages new solutions to respond to the challenges of care 
continuity, coordination, interprofessional and interinstitutional 
collaboration. Palliative care represents a chain management based on the 
involvement of every professional in acute care hospitals, palliative care 
units, nursing homes and private homes. The collaboration among the different 
players as well as their education are essential elements linked to the quality 
of care, to the quality of life for both patients and their relatives.

Obesity and hypertension in the Argentinian population compared to the white 
Hispanic population of the United States.

Hypertension and obesity are two closely related pathologies in clinical 
practice. Currently, about one billion adults worldwide are overweight, and it 
is estimated that, if no serious action is taken to effect profound change, that 
figure will continue to rise throughout this century. Hypertension is also a 
serious public health problem worldwide, one that, along with type 2 diabetes, 
is growing due to increases in both life expectancy and obesity. However, the 
rate of increase varies by population group. For example, in the United States, 
the prevalence of obesity differs quite markedly among the white population of 
European origin, African American individuals, and the Latin American 
population. This disparity exists among other populations as well, such as that 
of Argentina, where obesity is less prevalent than in the United States. This 
significant difference between the Argentinean population and that of American 
whites may be explained by the former population's migratory origin and distinct 
eating habits.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the levels and determinants of switching to any reversible 
modern contraceptive method following intrauterine device (IUD) discontinuation 
due to method-related reasons among women in developing countries.
STUDY DESIGN: We analysed 5-year contraceptive calendar data from 14 Demographic 
and Health Surveys, conducted in 1993-2008 (n=218,092 women; 17,151 women 
contributed a total of 18,485 IUD episodes). Life-table methods were used to 
determine overall and cause-specific probabilities of IUD discontinuation at 12 
months of use. For IUD episodes discontinued due to method-related reasons, the 
probability of switching to another reversible modern method within 3 months was 
estimated, overall and by place of residence, education level, motivation for 
use, age category and wealth tertiles. Country-specific rate ratios (RR) were 
estimated using generalized linear models, and pooled RRs using meta-analyses.
RESULTS: The median duration of uninterrupted IUD use was 37 months. At 12 
months, median probability of discontinuation was 13.2% and median probability 
of discontinuation due to method-related reasons was 8.9%. Within 3 months of 
discontinuation due to method-related reasons, half of the women had switched to 
another reversible modern method, 12% switched to traditional methods, 12% 
became pregnant, and 25% remained at risk for pregnancy. More educated women 
were more likely to switch to another reversible modern method than women with 
primary education or less (pooled RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.10-1.96), as were women in 
the highest wealth tertile (pooled RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.83) and women who were 
limiting births (pooled RR 1.35; 95% CI 1.08-1.68).
CONCLUSION: Delays to switching and switching to less reliable methods following 
IUD discontinuation remain a problem, exposing women to the risk of unwanted 
pregnancy. Family planning programmes should aim to improve quality of services 
through strengthening of counselling and follow-up services to support women's 
continuation of effective methods.
IMPLICATIONS: The risk of unintended pregnancy following IUD discontinuation 
remains high in developing countries. The quality of family planning services 
may be an important factor in switching to alternative modern contraceptive 
methods. Service providers should focus on counselling services and follow-up of 
women to support the continued use of effective methods.

Numerous clinical studies have confirmed that screening women age 40 years and 
older reduces breast cancer mortality by 30% to 50%. Several factors including 
faster breast cancer growth rates and lower breast cancer incidence among 
younger women, as well as shorter life expectancy and more comorbid conditions 
among older women, should also be considered in screening guidelines. Annual 
screening beginning at age 40 years and continuing with no upper age limit, as 
long as a woman has a life expectancy of at least 5 years and no significant 
comorbid conditions, is currently recommended.
