BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer 
worldwide and has significant morbidity and mortality and is increasing in 
incidence. While MM management costs are considerable, specific economic data at 
the country level remain scarce.
OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the burden and cost of MM in Portugal from the 
perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) to support the definition of 
health policies, resource allocation and patient care.
METHODS: Developed by the Portuguese Multiple Myeloma Group, this study 
considers the most recent available data. Burden of disease was measured using 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). The cost of MM was estimated using a 
prevalence-based model that estimated direct costs for the NHS considering all 
costs associated with diagnosis, hospitalizations, surgeries, emergency visits, 
medical appointments, drugs and transportation. Costs were quantified based on 
the diagnosis-related group funding price, except for drug usage, which was 
calculated using the average hospital product stock price.
RESULTS: The burden of disease attributable to MM for 2018 was estimated at 8931 
DALYs: 8570 resulting from premature deaths and 361 from disability. Average 
yearly direct costs per patients with MM amounted to €31,449 (year 2018 values). 
Total direct costs are estimated at €61 million per year.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in MM means that most DALYs are due to years of 
life lost rather than years lost due to disability. This study generates 
comprehensive data on the burden and cost of MM in Portugal and provides updated 
insights into the costs associated with the management of MM.

Sickle cell disease is the most common hemoglobinopathy and affects millions 
worldwide. The disease is associated with severe organ dysfunction, acute and 
chronic pain, and significantly decreased life expectancy. The large body of 
work demonstrating that hemolysis results in rapid consumption of the endogenous 
vasodilator nitric oxide, decreased nitric oxide production, and promotion of 
vaso-occlusion provides the basis for the hypothesis that nitric oxide 
bioavailability is reduced in sickle cell disease and that this deficit plays a 
role in sickle cell disease pain. Despite initial promising results, large 
clinical trials using strategies to increase nitric oxide bioavailability in 
sickle cell disease patients yielded no significant change in duration or 
frequency of acute pain crises. Further, recent investigations showed that 
sickle cell disease patients and mouse models have elevated baseline levels of 
blood nitrite, a reservoir for nitric oxide formation and a product of nitric 
oxide metabolism, regardless of pain phenotype. These conflicting results 
challenge the hypotheses that nitric oxide bioavailability is decreased and that 
it plays a significant role in the pathogenesis in sickle cell disease acute 
pain crises. Conversely, a large body of work demonstrates that nitric oxide, as 
a neurotransmitter, has a complex role in pain neurobiology, contributes to the 
development of central sensitization, and can mediate hyperalgesia in 
inflammatory and neuropathic pain. These results support an alternative 
hypothesis: one proposing that altered nitric oxide signaling may contribute to 
the development of neuropathic and/or inflammatory pain in sickle cell disease 
through its role as a neurotransmitter.

BACKGROUND: Repetitive, functional-based rehabilitation is recommended after 
stroke. However, impaired active digital extension is common after stroke, which 
limits functional-based rehabilitation and recovery. Non-robotic dynamic hand 
orthoses (DHOs) may address this.
OBJECTIVES: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether 
non-robotic DHOs improve upper limb recovery after stroke in comparison to 
i)placebo or no intervention and ii)usual care.
METHODS: We followed PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) assessing upper limb recovery associated with the use of non-robotic DHOs 
in adults after stroke. Outcomes of interest were functional upper limb movement 
and activities of daily living.We performed searches on 27 September 2019 in 10 
bibliographic databases including Cochrane Stroke Groups Specialized Trials 
Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We also searched 
gray literature and citations from included studies.Two reviewers independently 
screened abstracts and full text, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using 
a Cochrane risk of bias tool.
RESULTS: We reviewed 7225 titles and included four studies involving 56 
randomized participants, all with a high risk of bias. A positive effect in 
favor of non-robotic DHOs was observed for two outcomes; upper limb function 
(mean difference (MD) 6.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-12.19 (p = 0.04)) 
and dexterity (MD 2.99, 95% CI 0.39-5.60 (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The results are encouraging but included studies were small with 
high risk of bias meaning there is currently insufficient evidence that 
non-robotic DHOs improve upper limb recovery after stroke.

BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an insidiously progressive and 
debilitating form of arthritis involving the axial skeleton, characterized by 
chronic back pain and progressive spinal stiffness, and lessening of pain and 
stiffness with exercise. Due to subsequent manifestation in different organs, AS 
causes reduction in life expectancy, so early diagnosis and treatment are of 
great importance. No AS cases have been reported in solid-organ transplant 
recipients yet.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease due to 
chronic glomerulonephritis, after allogenic kidney transplantation 25 years 
earlier, with stable, good graft function, treated with chronic 
immunosuppressive therapy based on cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil, and 
prednisone, with no previous history of a connective tissue disease presented 
fever up to 39 °C accompanied by pain localized in sacroiliac region radiating 
to the left lower limb. Detailed diagnostic procedures and x-rays of the lumbar 
spine and of the targeted sacroiliac joints revealed lesions characteristic of 
AS. Sulphasalazine was added to standard immunosuppression regimen with good 
clinical results.
CONCLUSIONS: We report an adult kidney transplant recipient with a new onset of 
AS. The risk of relapse or new onset of inflammatory disease in transplant 
recipients is extremely low due to immunosuppressive therapy following 
transplantation. However, when it occurs, the clinical presentation is commonly 
atypical, often leading to delayed diagnosis.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: The dispatch of Advanced Life Support (ALS) teams in 
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is still a hardly studied aspect of prehospital 
emergency logistics. In 2015, the dispatch algorithm of Emilia Est Emergency 
Operation Centre (EE-EOC) was implemented and the dispatch of ALS teams was 
changed from primary to secondary based on triage of dispatched vehicles for 
high-priority interventions when teams with Immediate Life Support (ILS) skills 
were dispatched.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects on the appropriateness of 
ALS teams' intervention and their employment time, and to compare sensitivity 
and specificity of the algorithm implementation.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective before-after observational study.
SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Primary dispatches managed by EE-EOC involving 
ambulances and/or ALS teams were included. Two groups were created on the basis 
of the years of intervention (2013-2014 versus 2017-2018).
INTERVENTION: A switch from primary to secondary dispatch of ALS teams in case 
of high-priority dispatches managed by ILS teams was implemented.
OUTCOMES: Appropriateness of ALS team intervention, total task time of ALS 
vehicles, and sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were reviewed.
RESULTS: The study included 242,501 emergency calls that generated 56,567 red 
code dispatches. The new algorithm significantly increased global sensitivity 
and specificity of the system in terms of recognition of potential need of ALS 
intervention and the specificity of primary ALS dispatch. The appropriateness of 
ALS intervention was significantly increased; total tasking time per day for ALS 
and the number of critical dispatches without ALS available were reduced.
CONCLUSION: The revision of the dispatch criteria and the extension of the 
two-tiered dispatch for ALS teams significantly increased the appropriateness of 
ALS intervention and reduced both the global tasking time and the number of 
high-priority dispatches without ALS teams available.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an opioid abuse-prevention 
program embedded in the Narcotics Information Management System ("the Network 
System to Prevent Doctor-Shopping for Narcotics") in South Korea.
METHODS: Using a Markov model with a 1-year cycle length and 30-year time 
horizon, we estimated the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of implementing 
an opioid abuse-prevention program in patients prescribed outpatient opioids 
from a Korean healthcare payer's perspective. The model has 6 health states: no 
opioid use, therapeutic opioid use, opioid abuse, overdose, overdose death, and 
all-cause death. Patient characteristics, healthcare costs, and transition 
probabilities were estimated from national population-based data and published 
literature. Age- and sex-specific utilities of the general Korean population 
were used for the no-use state, whereas the other health-state utilities were 
obtained from published studies. Costs (in 2019 US dollars) included the 
expenses of the program, opioids, and overdoses. An annual 5% discount rate was 
applied to the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Parameter 
uncertainties were explored via deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: The program was associated with 2.27 fewer overdoses per 100 000 
person-years, with an ICUR of $227/QALY. The ICURs were generally robust to 
parameter changes, although the program's effect on abuse reduction was the most 
influential parameter. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the 
program reached a 100% probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $900/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The opioid abuse-prevention program appears to be cost-effective in 
South Korea. Mandatory use of the program should be considered to maximize 
clinical and economic benefits of the program.

OBJECTIVES: Metamodeling can address computational challenges within 
decision-analytic modeling studies evaluating many strategies. This article 
illustrates the value of metamodeling for evaluating colorectal cancer screening 
strategies while accounting for colonoscopy capacity constraints.
METHODS: In a traditional approach, the best screening strategy was identified 
from a limited subset of strategies evaluated with the validated Adenoma and 
Serrated pathway to Colorectal CAncer model. In a metamodeling approach, 
metamodels were fitted to this limited subset to evaluate all potentially 
plausible strategies and determine the best overall screening strategy. 
Approaches were compared based on the best screening strategy in life-years 
gained compared with no screening. Metamodel runtime and accuracy was assessed.
RESULTS: The metamodeling approach evaluated >40 000 strategies in <1 minute 
with high accuracy after 1 adaptive sampling step (mean absolute error: 0.0002 
life-years) using 300 samples in total (generation time: 8 days). Findings 
indicated that health outcomes could be improved without requiring additional 
colonoscopy capacity. Obtaining similar insights using the traditional approach 
could require at least 1000 samples (generation time: 28 days). Suggested 
benefits from screening at ages <40 years require adequate validation of the 
underlying Adenoma and Serrated pathway to Colorectal CAncer model before making 
policy recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Metamodeling allows rapid assessment of a vast set of strategies, 
which may lead to identification of more favorable strategies compared to a 
traditional approach. Nevertheless, metamodel validation and identifying 
extrapolation beyond the support of the original decision-analytic model are 
critical to the interpretation of results. The screening strategies identified 
with metamodeling support ongoing discussions on decreasing the starting age of 
colorectal cancer screening.

Cost-Effectiveness of Providing the Depression Care for People With Cancer 
Program to Patients With Prostate Cancer in the United States.

OBJECTIVES: The Depression Care for People with Cancer program (DCPC) is a 
cost-effective depression care model for UK patients with cancer. However, 
DCPC's cost-effectiveness in the United States is unknown, particularly for 
patients with prostate cancer in the United States. This study evaluates the 
health and economic impact of providing DCPC to patients with prostate cancer.
METHODS: DCPC was compared with usual care in a mathematical model that 
simulates depression and its outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of US patients 
with prostate cancer. DCPC was modeled as a sequential combination of universal 
depression screening, post-screening evaluations, and first-line combination 
therapy. Primary outcomes were lifetime direct costs of depression care, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. 
Secondary outcomes included life expectancy, number of depression-free months 
and lifetime depressive episodes, duration of depressive episodes, cumulative 
incidence of depression, lifetime depression diagnoses/misdiagnoses, and the 
cumulative incidence of maintenance therapy for depression. Sensitivity analyses 
were used to examine uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base case, DCPC dominated usual care by offering 0.11 more QALYs 
for $2500 less per patient (from averted misdiagnoses). DCPC also offered 5 
extra depression-free months, shorter depressive episodes, and a lower chance of 
maintenance therapy. DCPC's trade-offs were a higher cumulative incidence of 
depression and more lifetime depressive episodes. Life expectancy was identical 
under usual care and DCPC. Sensitivity analyses indicate that DCPC was almost 
always preferable to usual care.
CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care, DCPC may offer more value to US patients 
with prostate cancer. DCPC should be considered for inclusion in prostate cancer 
survivorship care guidelines.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the national impact and 
cost-effectiveness of the 2018 American College of Physicians (ACP) guidance 
statements compared to the status quo.
METHODS: Survey data from the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination were used to generate a national representative sample of 
individuals with diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the United States. Individuals 
with A1c <6.5% on antidiabetic medications are recommended to deintensify their 
A1c level to 7.0% to 8.0% (group 1); individuals with A1c 6.5% to 8.0% and a 
life expectancy of <10 years are recommended to deintensify their A1c level 
>8.0% (group 2); and individuals with A1c >8.0% and a life expectancy of >10 
years are recommended to intensify their A1c level to 7.0% to 8.0% (group 3). We 
used a Markov-based simulation model to evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness 
of following the ACP recommended A1c level.
RESULTS: 14.41 million (58.1%) persons with diagnosed type 2 diabetes would be 
affected by the new guidance statements. Treatment deintensification would lead 
to a saving of $363 600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) lost for group 1 
and a saving of $118 300 per QALY lost for group 2. Intensifying treatment for 
group 3 would lead to an additional cost of $44 600 per QALY gain. Nationally, 
the implementation of the guidance would add 3.2 million life-years and 1.1 
million QALYs and reduce healthcare costs by $47.7 billion compared to the 
status quo.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing the new ACP guidance statements would affect a large 
number of persons with type 2 diabetes nationally. The new guidance is 
cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) embeds an assumption at odds with 
most economic analysis-that of constant returns to health in the creation of 
happiness (utility). We aim to reconcile it with the bulk of economic theory.
METHODS: We generalize the traditional CEA approach, allow diminishing returns 
to health, and align CEA with the rest of the health economics literature.
RESULTS: This simple change has far-reaching implications for the practice of 
CEA. First, optimal cost-effectiveness thresholds should systematically rise for 
more severe diseases and fall for milder ones. We provide formulae for 
estimating how these thresholds vary with health-related quality of life (QoL) 
in the sick state. Practitioners can also use our approach to account for 
treatment outcome uncertainty. Holding average benefits fixed, risk-averse 
consumers value interventions more when they reduce outcome uncertainty 
('insurance value') and/or when they provide a chance at positively skewed 
outcomes ('value of hope'). Finally, we provide a coherent way to combine 
improvements in QoL and life expectancy (LE) when people have diminishing 
returns to QoL.
CONCLUSION: This new approach obviates the need for increasingly prevalent and 
ad hoc exceptions to CEA for end-of-life care, rare disease, and very severe 
disease (eg, cancer). Our methods also show that the value of improving QoL for 
disabled people is greater than for comparable non-disabled people, thus 
resolving an ongoing and mathematically legitimate objection to CEA raised by 
advocates for disabled people. Our Generalized Risk-Adjusted Cost-Effectiveness 
(GRACE) approach helps align HTA practice with realistic preferences for health 
and risk.

care and research of BC in Nigeria as part of the development of a larger 
national research programme aiming to improve outcomes and care of BC.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will be conducted according to Arksey and 
O'Malley scoping review methodology framework. The following electronic 
databases will be searched: Medline (using the PubMed interface), Ovid Gateway 
(Embase and Ovid), Cochrane library and Open Grey literature. Two independent 
reviewers will screen titles and abstracts and subsequently screen full-text 
studies for inclusion, any lack of consensus will be discussed with a third 
reviewer. Any study providing insight into the epidemiology or treatment pathway 
of BC (RCTs, observations, case series, policy paper) will be included. A data 
chart will be used to extract relevant data from the included studies. Results 
will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews. A consultation process 
will be carried out with a multidisciplinary team of Nigerian healthcare 
professionals, patients and scientists.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed 
publications. By highlighting the key gaps in the literature, this review can 
provide direction for future research and clinical guidelines in Nigeria (and 
other low-income and middle-income countries), where BC is more prevalent due to 
local risk factors and healthcare settings.

INTRODUCTION: A better understanding of the molecular, genetic and immunological 
characteristics of cancer and the introduction of new systemic treatment 
regimens in the last decades, has led to better treatment outcomes and increased 
survival rates for patients with previously short lived cancers. However, there 
is no uniform description to refer to this growing group of patients with 
advanced cancer who now respond to new systemic treatments for longer periods. 
Furthermore, little is known about the unique psychological challenges these 
patients face, living with ongoing uncertainty about the course of their disease 
and life expectancy. The objective of this scoping review is to identify the 
psychological aspects experienced by, and the definitions used to refer to 
patients with advanced cancer receiving lifelong systemic treatment.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will be among the first to summarise 
literature on the psychological issues in the growing group of advanced cancer 
patients undergoing long-term systemic treatment. Articles will be retrieved 
from six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and reviewed for eligibility by two 
investigators independently. Definitions and psychological challenges will be 
extracted and narratively summarised following a descriptive approach. 
Furthermore, results will contribute in providing a uniform definition for this 
patient group, and help to identify knowledge gaps to give direction to further 
research in this field.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval is required. The results of the 
scoping review will be submitted for publication to a scientific journal and 
presented at relevant conferences.

The molecular mechanism underlying photoperiodic response in seasonal breeding 
animals such as the Japanese quail, red jungle fowl, sheep, mouse, and hamster 
involves thyroid-stimulating hormone beta subunit (TSHβ) mRNA expression in the 
pars tuberalis stimulated by the extension in day length. Furthermore, this 
mechanism is regulated by eyes absent 3 (Eya3) in mammals. Even in birds, the 
expression of both TSHβ and EYA3 is induced in the pars tuberalis by the 
extension in day length; however, the relationship between the two genes is 
unknown. To clarify the function of EYA3 in quail photoperiodism, in the present 
study, we performed mRNA structure analysis of the Japanese quail EYA3 mRNA 
using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot 
analysis. The results revealed that there are four types of splice variants 
within regions of exons 7, 8, and 9 of quail EYA3 mRNA. Among the four splice 
variants of quail EYA3, the splice variant containing exon 7 was expressed in 
the pars tuberalis on the first long day, when quails were transferred from the 
short-day condition to the long-day condition. The results indicate that EYA3 
splice variant containing exon 7 is involved in the photoperiodic response of 
the pars tuberalis in the Japanese quail.

Over the past decade, the rise of cancer immunotherapy has coincided with a 
remarkable breakthrough in cancer therapy, which attracted increased interests 
in public. The scientific community clearly showed that the emergence of 
immunotherapy is an inevitable outcome of a holistic approach for cancer 
treatment. It is well established that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
utilizes the principle of homeostasis and balance to adjust the healthy status 
of body. TCM treatment toward cancer has a long history, and the diagnosis and 
treatment of tumors were discussed in the ancient and classical literatures of 
Chinese medicine, such as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon. Precious heritage 
has laid the foundation for the innovation and development of cancer treatment 
with TCM. The modern study indicated that TCM facilitates the treatment of 
cancer and enhances the survival rate and life expectancy of patients. However, 
the pharmacological mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet completely 
understood. In addition, physicians cannot always explain why the TCM treatment 
is effective and the mechanism of action cannot be explained in scientific 
terms. Here, we attempted to provide insights into the development of TCM in the 
treatment and interpret how TCM practitioners treat cancer through six general 
principles of TCM by using modern scientific language and terms based on newly 
discovered evidence.

COVID-19 has resulted in deepened states of crisis and vulnerability for people 
who use drugs throughout Europe and across the world, with social distancing 
measures having far-reaching implications for everyday life. Prolonged periods 
of isolation and solitude are acknowledged within much addiction literature as 
negatively impacting the experiences of those in recovery, while also causing 
harm to active users - many of whom depend on social contact for the purchasing 
and taking of substances, as well as myriad forms of support. Solitude, however, 
is proposed by the authors as inherent within some aspects of substance use, far 
from particular to the current pandemic. Certain forms of substance use engender 
solitary experience, even where use is predicated upon the presence of others. 
Adopting a cross-disciplinary perspective, this paper takes as its focus the 
urgent changes wrought by the pandemic upon everyday life for people who use 
drugs, drawing on recent ethnographic fieldwork with substance users in 
Scotland. Beyond the current crises, the paper proposes solitude, and by 
extension isolation, as an analytical framework for better apprehending lived 
experiences of substance use.

Muscle weakness and fatigue represent frequent disabling symptoms for Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS) patients. We evaluated the effects of an intensive task-oriented 
circuit training (TOCT) on perceived fatigue, muscle strength and changes in 
motor performance fatigability in mildly impaired MS patients. Fifteen MS 
patients performed different functional scales, self-reported questionnaires and 
instrumental evaluations before (T0) and after (T1) TOCT. Strength and 
performance fatigability were analyzed during isometric knee extension and ankle 
dorsiflexion through an isokinetic dinamometer, recording surface EMG signals of 
Vastus Medialis and Tibialis Anterior. The Dinamic Gait Index, Multiple 
Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and Multiple Sclerosis 
Walking Scale-12 significantly improved after training. An increase of exerted 
force during isometric knee extension was observed, whereas no significant 
changes were revealed on mechanical and electrical fatigue. Moreover, the 
improvement in perceived disability after treatment was related to strength 
increase in knee mechanical force output. The TOCT positively modifies perceived 
fatigue, perceived ambulatory function and knee force output in mildly impaired 
MS subjects, suggesting a virtuous circle between strength levels, recovery of 
functional skills and improved quality of life.

Testicular cancer (TC) is the most frequent solid tumor diagnosed in young adult 
males. Although it is a curable tumor, it is frequently associated with 
considerable short-term and long-term morbidity. Both biological and 
psychological stress experienced during cancer therapy may be responsible for 
stimulating molecular processes that induce premature aging and deterioration of 
immune system (immunosenescence) in TC survivors, leading to an increased 
susceptibility to infections, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Immunosenescence 
is a remodeling of immune cell populations with inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio, 
accumulation of highly differentiated memory cells, shrinkage of telomeres, 
shift of T-cell response to Th2 type, and release of pro-inflammatory signals. 
TC survivors exposed to chemotherapy show features of immunological aging, 
including an increase in memory T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and high expression of 
the senescence biomarker p16INK4a in CD3+ lymphocytes. However, the plethora of 
factors involved in the premature aging of TC survivors make the situation more 
complex if we also take into account the psychological stress and hormonal 
changes experienced by patients, as well as the high-dose chemotherapy and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that some individuals may be required to 
undergo. The relatively young age and the long life expectancy of TC patients 
bear witness to the importance of improving quality of life and of alleviating 
long-term side-effects of cancer treatments. Within this context, the present 
review takes an in-depth look at the molecular mechanisms of immunosenescence, 
describing experimental evidence of cancer survivor aging and highlighting the 
interconnected relationship between the many factors modulating the aging of the 
immune system of TC survivors.

Worldwide, typhoid infects 11-20 million people each year. In Pakistan, the 
first extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid was reported in 2016 resulting in 
an epidemic. To curb this battle of typhoid, the Expanded Program for 
Immunization (EPI) of Pakistan requested Global Alliance for Vaccines and 
Immunization (GAVI) for financial assistance. Hence becoming the first country 
to administer the vaccination against typhoid in children through EPI. To 
address the possible risk of endemic, it is needed that WHO and the United 
Nations should recommend all south Asian countries to avail of this golden 
opportunity provided by GAVI. Finally, the addition of typhoid vaccine in 
routine immunization will reduce mortalities, morbidities, health expenditure, 
and increase life expectancy in all low- and middle-income countries.

The burdens of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have fallen 
disproportionately on disadvantaged groups, including the poor and Black, 
Latinx, and Indigenous communities. There is substantial concern that the use of 
existing ICU triage protocols to allocate scarce ventilators and critical care 
resources-most of which are designed to save as many lives as possible-may 
compound these inequities. As governments and health systems revisit their 
triage guidelines in the context of impending resource shortages, scholars have 
advocated a range of alternative allocation strategies, including the use of a 
random lottery to give all patients in need an equal chance of ICU treatment. 
However, both the save-the-most-lives approach and random allocation are 
seriously flawed. In this Perspective, we argue that ICU triage policies should 
simultaneously promote population health outcomes and mitigate health 
inequities. These ethical goals are sometimes in conflict, which will require 
balancing the goals of maximizing the number of lives saved and distributing 
health benefits equitably across society. We recommend three strategies to 
mitigate health inequities during ICU triage: introducing a correction factor 
into patients' triage scores to reduce the impact of baseline structural 
inequities; giving heightened priority to individuals in essential, high-risk 
occupations; and rejecting use of longer-term life expectancy and categorical 
exclusions as allocation criteria. We present a practical triage framework that 
incorporates these strategies and attends to the twin public health goals of 
promoting population health and social justice.

BACKGROUND: Uncemented allograft prosthesis composite (APC) has been applied for 
tumorous bone defect reconstruction in the proximal femur. However, the 
long-term results are rarely reported. This study aimed to evaluate long-term 
outcomes of uncemented APC.
METHODS: Eighteen patients who received uncemented APC reconstruction in the 
proximal femur after tumor resections were retrospectively reviewed.
