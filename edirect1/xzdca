BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With rapid advancements in medicine, technology, and 
nutrition, the future holds the possibility of longer and healthier lives. 
Despite garnering attention from myriad disciplines, psychological perspectives 
on life extension are scarce. In three studies, we addressed this gap by 
exploring key mental characteristics and psychological variables associated with 
simulating an expanded life span and thus an extremely distant future self.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three studies investigated the construal (i.e., 
valence, vividness, and visual perspective) of extremely distant future 
simulations and the extent to which participants felt connected to their future 
selves (i.e., self-continuity). Studies 1 and 2 investigated the characteristics 
of imagery associated with different ages ranging from near the current species 
maximum (e.g., 120, 150) to more highly hypothetical ages (e.g., 201, 501). 
Study 3 probed the mental construal of extreme aging among different populations 
(i.e., life-extension supporters, students, and Mechanical Turk workers). 
Studies also assessed participants' general feelings about the ethicality and 
likelihood of techniques that halt or reverse biological aging to help 
individuals live beyond the current life expectancy.
RESULTS: Participants in all studies reported being able to vividly imagine 
expanded aging scenarios (increased chronological, without biological, and 
aging), but these simulations were characterized by a decreased sense of 
connection to one's future self (i.e., self-continuity) compared to a control 
condition. Temporal distance did not, however, impact ratings of self-continuity 
when comparing experimental conditions (i.e., imagining one's self 120 vs 150 or 
201 vs 501). Curiously, a sense of self-continuity (when simulating oneself well 
beyond the current life expectancy) remained intact for individuals who belonged 
to a community of life-extension supporters. The perceived likelihood and 
ethicality of extended life-span scenarios also varied significantly across 
different populations.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The current work is the first to quantify the 
disconnect between one's current and extremely distant (i.e., beyond the current 
life expectancy) future self. Given the behavioral implications of feeling 
disconnected from one's future self (e.g., failing to save for retirement or 
care for one's own physical health), these findings inform a critical barrier of 
extended life spans and provide insight into potential remedies (e.g., enhancing 
the perceived likelihood of living longer). Theoretical implications of 
hypotheticality and temporal distance, two key dimensions of Construal Level 
Theory, and their impact on the construal and self-continuity associated with 
future simulations are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION: The cancer board system employed at many hospitals and treatment 
centers involves multidisciplinary healthcare teams, including physicians, and 
the timing of treatment generally follows that of a consultation model. Thus, it 
is difficult to detect spinal metastases using the current implementation of the 
cancer board system, which can lead to delays in treatment. A new 
multidisciplinary treatment strategy for patients with metastatic spinal tumors 
was designed, and 745 patients were treated based on this strategy.
METHODS: In the first 5 years using the liaison treatment approach, 745 patients 
were diagnosed with metastatic spinal tumor. Tumors were discovered before a 
skeletal-related event (SRE) in 704 patients and after an SRE in 41 patients. We 
conducted our analysis in two patient groups: those with and without an SRE at 
the time of treatment initiation.
RESULTS: In most patients, the average spinal instability neoplastic score was 
5.2, which indicates that we were able to detect the spinal tumor before a 
significant breakdown of the spinal support system. Ninety-five percent of 
patients were classified according to the Frankel grade classification during 
their initial diagnosis, and many patients initially underwent treatment before 
the onset of paralysis. Of patients with an SRE, 33% were Frankel grade E, 
indicating that approximately half were paralyzed at initial diagnosis. The 
median survival duration was prolonged by approximately 9 months in patients 
without an SRE compared with those with an SRE.
CONCLUSIONS: Orthopedic spine surgeons are responsible for maintaining 
activities of daily living, improving quality of life, and prolonging life 
expectancy in patients with metastatic spinal tumors. The results of this study 
revealed that the liaison treatment system for metastatic spinal tumors has made 
it possible to successfully prevent SREs without neurological deficits and to 
prolong survival.

Demography of Thrips palmi (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) Reared on Brassica oleracea

In order to contrast the fitness of Thrips palmi Karny reared on two of its 
hosts plants, Brassica oleracea L. leaves and Phaseolus vulgaris L. beans, life 
tables were constructed for T. palmi individuals reared on the two hostplants at 
25°C using the age-stage, two-sex life table. The durations of the egg, first 
instar larva, pupa, and total immature stages of T. palmi reared on P. vulgaris 
were significantly longer than those reared on B. oleracea, whereas the adult 
preoviposition period, female adult longevity, and number of oviposition days of 
T. palmi reared on B. oleracea were significantly longer/greater than those on 
P. vulgaris. The fecundity (F) of T. palmi reared on B. oleracea (159.71 
offspring/female) was significantly higher than in females reared on P. vulgaris 
(F = 122.98 offspring/female) despite the higher proportion of female adults 
that emerged on P. vulgaris. Although there were no significant differences in 
the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate (λ), net reproductive rate (R0), 
and mean generation time (T) between the two populations, computer projection 
showed that the T. palmi population will increase faster when reared on B. 
oleracea than on P. vulgaris. Our results demonstrate that population projection 
based on life table data is potentially an important tool in pest management. 
Furthermore, we used the bootstrap technique to demonstrate the variable effect 
that survival rate and fecundity at different ages can have on population 
parameters.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current demographic changes indicate that more people 
will be care-dependent due to increasing life expectancy. Little is known about 
impact of preexisting dependency on stroke outcome after endovascular treatment 
(EVT).
METHODS: We compared prospectively collected baseline and outcome data of 
previously dependent vs. independent stroke patients (prestroke modified Rankin 
Scale score of 3-5 vs. 0-2) treated with EVT. Outcome measures were favorable 
3-month outcome (mRS ≤ 3 for previously dependent and mRS ≤ 2 for independent 
patients, respectively), death and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH).
RESULTS: Among 1247 patients, 84 (6.7%) were dependent before stroke. They were 
older (81 vs. 72 years of age), more often female (61.9% vs. 46%), had a higher 
stroke severity at baseline (NIHSS 18 vs. 15 points), more often history of 
previous stroke (32.9% vs. 9.1%) and more vascular risk factors than independent 
patients. Favorable outcome and mortality were to the disadvantage of 
independent patients (26.2% vs. 44.4% and 46.4% vs. 25.5%, respectively), 
whereas sICH was comparable in both cohorts (4.9% vs. 5%). However, preexisting 
dependency was not associated with clinical outcome and mortality after 
adjusting for outcome predictors (OR 1.076, 95% CI 0.612-1.891; p = 0.799 and OR 
1.267, 95% CI 0.758-2.119; p = 0.367, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the need for careful selection of 
care-dependent stroke patients when considering EVT, given a less favorable 
outcome observed in this cohort. Nonetheless, EVT should not systematically be 
withheld in patients with preexisting disability, since prior dependency does 
not significantly influence outcome.

PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of hospice staff in predicting survival of 
subjects admitted to hospice, exploring the factors considered most helpful by 
the hospice staff to accurately predict survival.
METHODS: Five physicians and 11 nurses were asked to predict survival at 
admission of 827 patients. Actual and predicted survival times were divided into 
≤ 1 week, 2-3 weeks, 4-8 weeks, and ≥ 2 months and the accuracy of the estimates 
was calculated. The staff members were each asked to score 17 clinical variables 
that guided them in predicting survival and we analyzed how these variables 
impacted the accuracy.
RESULTS: Physicians' and nurses' accuracy of survival of the patients was 46% 
and 40% respectively. Survival was underestimated in 20% and 12% and 
overestimated in 34% and 48% of subjects. Both physicians and nurses considered 
metastases, comorbidities, dyspnea, disability, tumor site, neurological 
symptoms, and confusion very important in predicting patients' survival with 
nurses assigning more importance to intestinal symptoms and pain too. All these 
factors, with the addition of cough and/or bronchial secretions, were associated 
with physicians' greater accuracy. In the multivariable models, intestinal 
symptoms and confusion continued to be associated with greater predictive 
accuracy. No factors appreciably raised nurses' accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Some clinical symptoms rated as relevant by the hospice staff could 
be important for predicting survival. However, only intestinal symptoms and 
confusion significantly improved the accuracy of physicians' predictions, 
despite the high prevalence of overestimated survival.

We introduce STAMPS, a pathway-centric web service for the development of 
targeted proteomics assays. STAMPS guides the user by providing several 
intuitive interfaces for a rapid and simplified method design. Applying our 
curated framework to signaling and metabolic pathways, we reduced the average 
assay development time by a factor of ∼150 and revealed that the insulin 
signaling is actively controlled by protein abundance changes in 
insulin-sensitive and -resistance states. Although at the current state STAMPS 
primarily contains mouse data, it was designed for easy extension with 
additional organisms.

Infection with HIV is a chronic condition that requires daily medication to 
suppress viral replication. With appropriate treatment, people living with HIV 
have a life expectancy approaching that of the general population. However, they 
are at increased risk for comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, renal 
disease, type 2 diabetes, neurologic conditions, and cancers, often with worse 
outcomes than in patients without HIV. When they are admitted to critical care 
settings, care considerations, particularly regarding antiretroviral therapy, 
must be addressed. Antiretroviral therapy is critical for successful management 
of HIV infection and should be continued when possible during intensive care 
unit stays. However, many antiretroviral regimens result in drug-drug 
interactions, adverse drug-related events, and secondary complications such as 
insulin resistance and prolonged QT intervals. Critical care nurses have unique 
opportunities to provide safe, unbiased, and compassionate care that promotes 
health for a population of people who have a history of being stigmatized.

BACKGROUND: No economic evaluations exist of free or subsidized ridesharing 
services designed to reduce impaired driving.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects and economics of a 17-weekend program that 
provided rideshare coupons good for free one-way or round trips to/from the 
hospitality zones in Columbus, Ohio, coupled with a modest increase in 
enforcement and a media campaign that used messaging about enforcement to 
promote usage.
METHODS: Web surveys of riders and intercept surveys of foot traffic in the 
hospitality zones yielded data on the reduction in driving after drinking and 
the change in alcohol consumption associated with coupon use. We estimated crash 
changes from trip data using national studies, then confirmed with an ARIMA 
analysis of monthly police crash reports. Costs and output data came from 
program and rideshare company records.
RESULTS: 70.8% of 19,649 responding coupon redeemers said coupon use reduced the 
chance they would drive after drinking. An estimated 1 in 4,310 drink-driving 
trips results in an alcohol-attributable crash, so the coupons prevented an 
estimated 3.2 crashes. Consistent with that minimal change, the ARIMA analysis 
did not detect a drunk-driving crash reduction. Self-reports indicated alcohol 
consumption rose by an average of 0.4 drinks per coupon redeemer, possibly with 
an equal rise among people who rode with the redeemer. The program cost almost 
$650,000 and saved an estimated 1.8 years of healthy life. Across a range of 
discount rates and values for a year of healthy life, it cost $366,000 to 
$791,000 per year of healthy life saved. Its estimated benefit-cost ratio was 
between 0.31 and 0.59, meaning it cost far more than it saved.
CONCLUSIONS: Ridesharing, coupled with a media campaign and increased 
enforcement, was not a cost-effective drunk-driving intervention. Although it 
reduced drink-driving crashes and saved years of healthy life, those savings 
were modest and expensive. Moreover, the self-reported increase in participant 
drinking imposed countervailing risks. Even sensitivity analyses that 
potentially overestimate the benefits and underestimate the costs indicate a 
significant imbalance between program costs and savings. Any funding devoted to 
ridesharing would divert scarce resources from interventions with benefit-cost 
ratios above 1. Thus, our evaluation suggests that governments should not devote 
energy or resources to ridesharing programs if their primary objective is to 
reduce drink-driving or harmful alcohol use.

BACKGROUND: Blood plasma collected at time of surgery is an excellent source of 
patient material for investigations into disease aetiology and for the discovery 
of novel biomarkers. Previous studies on limited sets of proteins and patients 
have indicated that pre-operative fasting and anaesthesia can affect protein 
levels, but this has not been investigated on a larger scale. These effects 
could produce erroneous results in case-control studies if samples are not 
carefully matched.
METHODS: The proximity extension assay (PEA) was used to characterize 983 unique 
proteins in a total of 327 patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 50 
age-matched healthy women. The samples were collected either at time of initial 
diagnosis or before surgery under general anaesthesia.
RESULTS: 421 of the investigated proteins (42.8%) showed statistically 
significant differences in plasma abundance levels comparing samples collected 
at time of diagnosis or just before surgery under anaesthesia.
CONCLUSIONS: The abundance levels of the plasma proteome in samples collected 
before incision, i.e., after short-time fasting and under general anaesthesia 
differs greatly from levels in samples from awake patients. This emphasizes the 
need for careful matching of the pre-analytical conditions of samples collected 
from controls to cases at time of surgery in the discovery as well as clinical 
use of protein biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Older haemodialysis patients accompany a high burden of functional 
impairment, limited life expectancy, and healthcare utilization. This 
meta-analysis aimed to evaluate how various risk factors influenced the 
prognosis of haemodialysis patients in late life, which might contribute to 
decision making by patients and care providers.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched systematically for 
studies evaluating the risk factors for mortality in elderly haemodialysis 
patients. Twenty-eight studies were included in the present systematic review. 
The factors included age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, type of 
vascular access, dialysis initiation time, nutritional status and geriatric 
impairments. Geriatric impairments included frailty, cognitive or functional 
impairment and falls. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were derived.
RESULTS: Functional impairment (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.20-1.75), cognitive 
impairment (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.32-1.62) and falls (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 
1.06-1.23) were significantly and independently associated with increased 
mortality in elderly haemodialysis patients. Low body mass index conferred a 
mortality risk (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.31-1.56) paralleling that of frailty as a 
marker of early death. The results also confirmed that the older (OR = 1.43, 95% 
CI: 1.22-1.68) and sicker (in terms of Charlson comorbidity index) (OR = 1.41, 
95% CI: 1.35-1.50) elderly haemodialysis patients were, the more likely they 
were to die. In addition, increased mortality was associated with early-start 
dialysis (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01-1.37) and with the use of a central venous 
catheter (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.44-1.62).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors influence the risk of mortality in elderly 
patients undergoing haemodialysis. Geriatric impairment is related to poor 
outcome. Functional/cognitive impairment and falls in elderly dialysis patients 
are strongly and independently associated with mortality.

BACKGROUND: Healthy life years have superseded life expectancy (LE) as the most 
important indicator for population health. The most common approach to separate 
the total number of life years into those spent in good and poor health is the 
Sullivan method which incorporates the health dimension to the classic period 
life table, thus transforming the LE indicator into the health expectancy (HE) 
indicator. However, life years derived from a period life table and health 
prevalence derived from survey data are based on different conceptual 
frameworks.
METHOD: We modify the Sullivan method by combining the health prevalence data 
with the conceptually better fitting cross-sectional average length of life 
(CAL). We refer to this alternative HE indicator as the "cross-sectional average 
length of healthy life" (HCAL). We compare results from this alternative 
indicator with the conventional Sullivan approach for nine European countries. 
The analyses are based on EU-SILC data in three empirical applications, 
including the absolute and relative level of healthy life years, changes between 
2008 and 2014, and the extent of the gender gap.
RESULTS: HCAL and conventional HE differ in each of these empirical 
applications. In general, HCAL provides larger gains in healthy life years in 
recent years, but at the same time greater declines in the proportion of healthy 
life years. Regarding the gender gap, HCAL provides a more favourable picture 
for women compared to conventional HE. Nonetheless, the extent of these 
differences between the indicators is only of minor extent.
CONCLUSIONS: Albeit the differences between HE and HCAL are small, we found some 
empirical examples in which the two indicators led to different conclusions. It 
is important to note, however, that the measurement of health and the data 
quality are much more important for the healthy life years indicator than the 
choice of the variant of the Sullivan method. Nonetheless, we suggest to use 
HCAL in addition to HE whenever possible because it widens the spectrum of 
empirical analyses and serves for verification of results based on the highly 
sensitive HE indicator.

INTRODUCTION: We present practical metrics for estimating the expected health 
benefits of specific research proposals. These can be used by research funders, 
researchers and healthcare decision-makers within low-income and middle-income 
countries to support evidence-based research prioritisation.
METHODS: The methods require three key assessments: (1) the current level of 
uncertainty around the endpoints the proposed study will measure; (2) how 
uncertainty impacts on the health benefits and costs of healthcare programmes 
and (3) the health opportunity costs imposed by programme costs. Research is 
valuable because it can improve health by informing the choice of which 
programmes should be implemented. We provide a Microsoft Excel tool to allow 
readers to generate estimates of the health benefits of research studies based 
on these three assessments. The tool can be populated using existing studies, 
existing cost-effectiveness models and expert opinion. Where such evidence is 
not available, the tool can quantify the value of research under different 
assumptions. Estimates of the health benefits of research can be considered 
alongside research costs, and the consequences of delaying implementation until 
research reports, to determine whether research is worthwhile. We illustrate the 
method using a case study of research on HIV self-testing programmes in Malawi. 
This analysis combines data from the literature with outputs from the HIV 
synthesis model.
RESULTS: For this case study, we found a costing study that could be completed 
and inform decision making within 1 year offered the highest health benefits (67 
000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted). Research on outcomes 
improved population health to a lesser extent (12 000 DALYs averted) and only if 
carried out alongside programme implementation.
CONCLUSION: Our work provides a method for estimating the health benefits of 
research in a practical and timely fashion. This can be used to support 
accountable use of research funds.

OBJECTIVE: The S0226 trial demonstrated that the combination of half-dose 
fulvestrant (FUL) and anastrozole (ANA) (F&A) caused a significant improvement 
in overall survival (OS) versus ANA monotherapy for first-line treatment of 
postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer 
(PMW-MBC (HR+)). The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of F&A in the first-line treatment for PMW-MBC (HR+) in 
China.
DESIGN: We constructed a Markov model over a life-time horizon. The clinical 
outcomes and utility data were obtained from published literature. Cost data 
were obtained from official Chinese websites. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to test result uncertainty.
SETTING: Chinese healthcare system perspective.
POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of adult patients presenting with PMW-MBC 
(HR+).
INTERVENTIONS: F&A compared with full-dose FUL and ANAmonotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome of this study was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY).
RESULTS: ANA was estimated to have the lowest cost and minimum life-years. The 
ICER of F&A versus ANA was US$15 665.891/QALY with incremental cost and QALY of 
US$12 401.120 and 0.792, respectively, which was less than the 
willingness-to-pay of US$29 383/QALY. Compared with F&A, FUL yielded a higher 
cost and a shorter lifetime; hence, it was identified as a dominated strategy. 
The univariate sensitivity analysis indicated the price of FUL was the most 
influential factor in our study. The probability that F&A was cost-effective at 
a threshold of US$29 383/QALY in China was 86.5%.
CONCLUSION: F&A is a cost-effective alternative to FUL and ANA monotherapy for 
the first-line treatment of PMW-MBC (HR+) in China. F&A is a promising 
first-line treatment for PMW-MBC (HR+), and more research is needed to evaluate 
the economy of using F&A in other countries.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the global and regional burden of Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV)-attributed malignancies.
DESIGN: An international comparative study based on the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) Study estimates.
SETTING: Global population by age, sex, region, demographic index and time.
METHODS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: The burden of EBV-attributed Burkitt lymphoma 
(BL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gastric 
carcinoma (GC) was estimated in a two-step process. In the first step, the 
fraction of each malignancy attributable to EBV was estimated based on published 
studies; this was then applied to the GBD estimates to determine the global and 
regional incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 
each malignancy by age, sex, geographical region and social demographic index 
(SDI) from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: The combined global incidence of BL, HL, NPC and GC in 2017 was 
1.442 million cases, with over 973 000 deaths. An estimated 265 000 (18%) 
incident cases and 164 000 (17%) deaths were due to the EBV-attributed fraction. 
This is an increase of 36% in incidence and 19% in mortality from 1990. In 2017, 
EBV-attributed malignancies caused 4.604 million DALYs, of which 82% was due to 
NPC and GC alone. The incidence of both of these malignancies was higher in high 
and middle-high SDI regions and peaked in adults aged between 50 and 70 years. 
All four malignancies were more common in males and the highest burden was 
observed in East Asia.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides comprehensive estimates of the burden of 
EBV-attributed BL, HL, NPC and GC. The overall burden of EBV-related 
malignancies is likely to be higher since EBV is aetiologically linked to 
several other malignancies not included in this analysis. Increasing global 
population and life expectancy is expected to further raise this burden in the 
future. The urgency for developing an effective vaccine to prevent these 
malignancies cannot be overstated.

model-based evaluation of long-term cost-effectiveness.

The STarT Back approach comprises subgrouping patients with low back pain (LBP) 
according to the risk of persistent LBP-related disability, with appropriate 
matched treatments. In a 12-month clinical trial and implementation study, this 
stratified care approach was clinically and cost-effective compared with usual, 
nonstratified care. Despite the chronic nature of LBP and associated economic 
burden, model-based economic evaluations in LBP are rare and have shortcomings. 
This study therefore produces a de novo decision model of this stratified care 
approach for LBP management to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness and 
address methodological concerns in LBP modelling. A cost-utility analysis from 
the National Health Service perspective compared stratified care with usual care 
in patients consulting in primary care with nonspecific LBP. A Markov 
state-transition model was constructed where patient prognosis over 10 years was 
dependent on physical function achieved at 12 months. Data from the clinical 
trial and implementation study provided short-term model parameters, with 
extrapolation using 2 cohort studies of usual care in LBP. Base-case results 
indicate this model of stratified care is cost-effective, delivering 0.14 
additional quality-adjusted life years at a cost saving of £135.19 per patient 
over a time horizon of 10 years. Sensitivity analyses indicate the approach is 
likely to be cost-effective in all scenarios and cost saving in most. It is 
likely this stratified care model will help reduce unnecessary healthcare usage 
while improving the patient's quality of life. Although decision-analytic 
modelling is used in many conditions, its use has been underexplored in LBP, and 
this study also addresses associated methodological challenges.

Objective This study investigates the impact of physical workload factors and 
occupational class on working life expectancy (WLE) and working years lost (WYL) 
in a sample of older Finnish workers. Methods A 70% random sample of Finns in 
2004 was linked to a job exposure matrix for physical workload factors and 
register information on occupational class and labor market status until 2014. 
Transitions between being at work, time-restricted work disability, 
unemployment, economic inactivity, disability retirement, retirement and death 
were estimated. A multistate Cox regression model with transition-specific 
covariates was used to estimate the WLE and WYL at age 50 up to 63 years for 
each occupational class and physical workload factor for men and women (N=415 
105). Results At age 50, male and female manual workers had a WLE of 10.13 and 
10.14 years, respectively. Among both genders, manual workers had one year 
shorter WLE at age 50 than upper non-manual employees. This difference was 
largely attributable to unemployment (men: 0.60, women: 0.66 years) and 
disability retirement (men: 0.28, women: 0.29 years). Self-employed persons had 
the highest WLE (11.08 years). Men and women exposed to four or five physical 
workload factors had about one year lower WLE than non-exposed workers. The 
difference was primarily attributable to ill-health-related reasons, including 
disability retirement (men: 0.45 years, women: 0.53 years) and time-restricted 
work disability (men: 0.23, women: 0.33 years). Conclusions Manual workers and 
those exposed to physical workload factors had the lowest WLE. The differences 
in WYL between exposure groups can primarily be explained by ill-health-based 
exit routes.

Sensitive detection of intracellular telomerase activity via double signal 
amplification and ratiometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer.

As an important and universal tumor marker, the reliable and in situ detection 
of intracellular telomerase activity is crucial for cancer diagnosis. Herein, a 
ratiometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method was developed 
for detecting intracellular telomerase activity. It takes full advantage of 
manganese dioxide nanosheets (MnO2NS) that can carry DNA probes with different 
conformations into cells and then completely release the DNA probes via 
decomposition of MnO2NS by intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH). In the 
presence of telomerase, a telomere substrate (TS) could be extended to form long 
telomerase extension products (TEPs), which trigger the cycling strand 
displacement reaction (SDR) between two fluorophore-labeled hairpin DNA probes 
to form lots of DNA duplexes. The close contact of two fluorophores led to an 
effective ratiometric FRET for reliable detection of telomerase activity. 
Fluorescence confocal imaging demonstrated that the activity of telomerase in 
tumor cells was reliably detected. The inhibition of telomerase activity by an 
inhibitor resulted in a decrease in FRET signal. For extracellular detection, 
the FRET ratio (FA/FD) shows a good linear relationship with the number of HeLa 
cells in the range of 20-1000 cells. Therefore, it offers a more facile method 
for reliable and sensitive detection of intracellular telomerase activity.

The proposed method is to do simplification for Digital Elevation Model (DEM), 
which uses a few of original nodes representing the terrain surface while 
maintaining the accuracy. The original DEM nodes are sampled using the Maximal 
Poisson-disk Sampling (MPS), in which, the disk's size of each sample is 
computed on basis of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). MPS can generate 
the hyper-uniformly distributed samples and was taken to do DEM adaptive 
sampling by being combined with the geodesic metric. However, the geodesic 
distance computation is complex and the requirement for memory is high. As such, 
this paper proposes an extension of the classic MPS based method for selecting 
quasi-randomly distributed points from DEM nodes based on the distribution of 
eigenvalues, accounting for surface heterogeneity. To achieve this objective, 
uniform MPS is conducted to sample the DEM nodes by setting the related disk 
radius to be inversely proportional to the local terrain complexity, which is 
defined as an index expressing the local terrain variation. Then, the geodesic 
metric related parameters are implicitly contained in the defined index. As a 
result, more samples are concentrated in the rugged regions, and vice versa. The 
proposed method shows better perfermance, at least the results are comparable 
with the geodesic distance based Poisson disk sampling method. Meanwhile, it 
greatly accelerates the sampling process and reduces the memory cost.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, occurs due to transcriptional changes in 
genetic and epigenetic including numerous genes and proteins. Worldwide, breast 
cancer (BC) is the life-threatening malignancies in women, is characterized by 
the occurrence of more than one molecular alteration. The incidence and 
mortality of BC are growing every day because of the adoption of western living 
standards, metropolitanization, and more life expectancy. Even though many 
modern approaches are available for the detection and treatment of BC, despite 
of these, it remains the topmost cause of death in women. This review highlights 
various approaches, including the importance of clinical, pathological, and 
molecular aspects of BC. Moreover, risk factors, biomarkers, immunotherapy, 
investigational drugs, and their role through tumor targets and immune systems 
have been discussed for management of BC. Furthermore, various targeting 
approaches for tumors through nanocarriers and their clinical trials have been 
elaborated in BC challenges and future perspectives.

PURPOSE: With a median age at diagnosis of 73 years, bladder cancer has the 
highest median age of all cancers. Age alone seems to be an independent risk 
factor for developing the disease with peak age advancing into the range of 85 
years. As demographic changes will lead to an ever more aging population in 
western countries, incidence of advanced age malignancies will rise. We, 
therefore, analyzed a contemporary radical cystectomy (RC) series at a single 
high-volume center on patients undergoing RC for urothelial carcinoma of the 
bladder (UCB). We aim to evaluate the feasibility of RC in the oldest-old 
patient cohort by assessing perioperative complications and long-term outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 1,278 consecutive 
patients who underwent RC for UCB at our tertiary referral center between 2004 
and 2019. A total of 408 patients were aged 75-97 years at the time of RC and 
were further divided into 2 groups: 75-84 years of age (group 1) and ≥85 years 
of age (group 2). Median follow-up was 23 months. Outcome was analyzed using the 
χ2 test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test.
RESULTS: Perioperative Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III complications were seen in 25.1% 
(92/366) of group 1 patients and 35.7% (15/42) of group 2 patients (p = 0.073).
