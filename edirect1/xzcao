BACKGROUND: Even though male-biased parasitism is common in mammals, little 
effort has been made to evaluate whether higher parasitic burden in males 
results in an extra biological cost, and thus a decrease in fitness. Body 
condition impairment and the augmentation of oxidative stress can be used as 
indicators of the cost of parasite infections. Here, we examined relationships 
between gastrointestinal and respiratory helminths, body condition and oxidative 
stress markers (glutathione peroxidase, paraoxonase-1) in 28 Pyrenean chamois 
(Rupicapra p. pyrenaica) sampled in autumn.
RESULTS: Only male chamois showed a reduction in body condition and higher 
oxidative stress due to parasite infection, likely because of the extremely high 
parasite burdens observed in males.
CONCLUSIONS: This study made evident a disparity in the physiological cost of 
multiple parasitism between sexes in a wild mammal, mainly due to parasitic 
richness. Because of the similar life expectancy in male and female chamois, we 
suggest that males may have developed natural mechanisms to compensate for 
higher parasite loads during the rut.

OBJECTIVES: Palliative sedation is a highly debated medical practice, 
particularly regarding its proper use in end-of-life care. Worldwide, guidelines 
are used to standardise care and regulate this practice. In this review, we 
identify and compare national/regional clinical practice guidelines on 
palliative sedation against the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) 
palliative sedation Framework and assess the developmental quality of these 
guidelines using the Appraisal Guideline Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) 
instrument.
METHODS: Using the PRISMA criteria, we searched multiple databases (PubMed, 
CancerLit, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, NHS Evidence and Google Scholar) for 
relevant guidelines, and selected those written in English, Dutch and Italian; 
published between January 2000 and March 2016.
RESULTS: Of 264 hits, 13 guidelines-Belgium, Canada (3), Ireland, Italy, Japan, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Europe, and USA (2) were selected. 8 contained 
at least 9/10 recommendations published in the EAPC Framework; 9 recommended 
'pre-emptive discussion of the potential role of sedation in end-of-life care'; 
9 recommended 'nutrition/hydration while performing sedation' and 8 acknowledged 
the need to 'care for the medical team'. There were striking differences in 
terminologies used and in life expectancy preceding the practice. Selected 
guidelines were conceptually similar, comparing closely to the EAPC Framework 
recommendations, albeit with notable variations.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on AGREE II, 3 guidelines achieved top scores and could 
therefore be recommended for use in this context. Also, domains 'scope and 
purpose' and 'editorial independence' ranked highest and lowest, 
respectively-underscoring the importance of good reportage at the developmental 
stage.

Two of the most studied and widely accepted conjectures on possible aging 
mechanisms are the oxidative stress hypothesis and the insulin/insulin-like 
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway. Intermittent fasting (IF) is 
known to modulate aging and to prolong lifespan in a variety of organisms, but 
the mechanisms are still under debate. In this study, we first demonstrated that 
late-onset two consecutive days a week fasting, a form of IF, termed 
intermittent food restriction (IFR), exhibited a time-dependent effect, and 
long-term late-onset IFR extended the mean lifespan and maximum lifespan by 
approximately 3.5 and 3 weeks, respectively, in the annual fish Nothobranchius 
guentheri. We also showed that IFR reduced the accumulation of lipofuscin in the 
gills and the protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation levels in the muscles. 
Moreover, IFR was able to enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes 
catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase in the fish. Finally, 
IFR was also able to decelerate the decrease of SirT1 and Foxo3A, but accelerate 
the decrease of IGF-1. Collectively, our findings suggest that late-onset IFR 
can retard the onset of age-related markers, and prolong the lifespan of the 
aging fish, via a synergistic action of an anti-oxidant system and the IIS 
pathway. It also proposes that the combined assessment of anti-oxidant system 
and IIS pathway will contribute to providing a more comprehensive view of 
anti-aging process.

AIMS: The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in type 1 
diabetes (T1D) has increased in recent years. Sensor-augmented pump therapy 
(SAP) with low glucose suspend (LGS) (allowing temporary suspension of insulin 
delivery if blood glucose level falls below a pre-defined threshold level) 
provides additional benefits over CSII alone, but is associated with higher 
acquisition costs. Therefore, a cost-effectiveness analysis of SAP+LGS versus 
CSII in patients with T1D was performed.
METHODS: Analyses were performed using the CORE Diabetes Model in two different 
patient cohorts in Denmark, one with hyperglycemia at baseline and one with 
increased risk for hypoglycemic events. Clinical input data were sourced from 
published literature. The analysis was performed over a lifetime time horizon 
from a societal perspective. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted 
at 3% per annum.
RESULTS: In patients who were hyperglycemic at baseline the use of SAP+LGS 
versus CSII resulted in improved quality-adjusted life expectancy (12.44 versus 
10.99 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) but higher mean lifetime costs (DKK 
2,027,316 versus DKK 1,801,293) leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of DKK 156,082 per QALY gained. For patients at increased risk for 
hypoglycemic events the ICER for SAP+LGS versus CSII was DKK 89,868 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICER for SAP+LGS versus CSII falls below commonly cited 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. Therefore, in Denmark, the use of SAP+LGS is 
likely to be considered cost-effective relative to CSII for patients with T1D 
who are either hyperglycemic, despite CSII use, or who experience frequent 
severe hypoglycemic events.

Canadian indigenous (First Nations) have rates of kidney failure that are 2- to 
4-fold higher than the non-indigenous general Canadian population. As such, a 
strategy of targeted screening and treatment for CKD may be cost-effective in 
this population. Our objective was to assess the cost utility of screening and 
subsequent treatment for CKD in rural Canadian indigenous adults by both 
estimated glomerular filtration rate and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. 
A decision analytic Markov model was constructed comparing the screening and 
treatment strategy to usual care. Primary outcomes were presented as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) presented as a cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). Screening for CKD was associated with an ICER of $23,700/QALY 
in comparison to usual care. Restricting the model to screening in communities 
accessed only by air travel (CKD prevalence 34.4%), this ratio fell to 
$7,790/QALY. In road accessible communities (CKD prevalence 17.6%) the ICER was 
$52,480/QALY. The model was robust to changes in influential variables when 
tested in univariate sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
found 72% of simulations to be cost-effective at a $50,000/QALY threshold and 
93% of simulations to be cost-effective at a $100,000/QALY threshold. Thus, 
targeted screening and treatment for CKD using point-of-care testing equipment 
in rural Canadian indigenous populations is cost-effective, particularly in 
remote air access-only communities with the highest risk of CKD and kidney 
failure. Evaluation of targeted screening initiatives with cluster randomized 
controlled trials and integration of screening into routine clinical visits in 
communities with the highest risk is recommended.

China and India are the 2 fastest growing major world economies. However, they 
suffer from great differences in health policies, demographics, and rates of 
population growth. Whereas China has seen a steep decline in rheumatic heart 
disease (RHD) and a rise in life expectancy, India continues to suffer from a 
significant burden of RHD due to insufficient distribution of economic 
prosperity to health care, denser population, and ineffective application of 
World Health Organization RHD prevention guidelines. As China faces the burden 
of the world's largest geriatric population, focus has shifted to calcific 
aortic stenosis for which it prepares by expansions in the field of 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Conversely, India has a younger 
population and a lower average life expectancy. Therefore, focus in India has 
still not shifted to calcific aortic stenosis as a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality as RHD continues to constitute the bulk of valvular heart disease.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of continued treatment 
with aripiprazole once-monthly 400mg (AOM 400) in patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: Patients who completed the QUALIFY study (NCT01795547) in the AOM 400 
arm were eligible for 6 additional once-monthly injections of AOM 400 during an 
open-label, 24-week extension (NCT01959035). Safety data were collected at each 
visit. Effectiveness measures included change from baseline in health-related 
qualify of life and functioning on the Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life scale 
(QLS) and Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale.
RESULTS: Of the 88 patients enrolled, 77 (88%) completed the extension study. 
Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence ≥2%) were weight 
increased (6/88, 7%), toothache (3/88, 3%) and headache (3/88, 3%). 
Effectiveness was maintained during the extension study, with small but 
continued improvements from baseline: the least squares mean (LSM) change (95% 
CI) from baseline to week 24 was 2.32 (-1.21 to 5.85) for the QLS total score 
and -0.10 (-0.26 to 0.06) for the CGI-S score. The aggregated LSM change (95% 
CI) from baseline of the lead-in study to week 24 of the extension study was 
11.54 (7.45 to 15.64) for the QLS total score and -0.98 (-1.18 to -0.79) for the 
CGI-S score.
CONCLUSIONS: AOM 400 was well tolerated in patients continuing AOM treatment 
during the extension phase of the QUALIFY study. Robust and clinically 
meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life and functioning were 
maintained, further supporting the long-term clinical benefits of AOM 400 for 
the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

In the present study, the peripheral blood cells of half smooth tongue sole 
(Cynoglossus semilaevis) were examined by blood smear under the light 
microscopy. The proportion of main types of blood cells are as following: 
erythrocyte occupied the majority (92.3%), followed by thrombocyte (4.15%), 
granulocyte (1.7%), lymphocyte (1.5%) and monocyte (0.3%), respectively. 
Meanwhile, the isolation method of monocytes was established, by density 
gradient centrifugation to isolate mononuclear leukocytes of peripheral blood. 
In primary culture, the monocytes were adhered to the bottom of the flask 
without feeder cells and separated easily with suspended leukocytes in the 
medium in 3 h. After suspended leukocytes were removed, the monocytes multiplied 
rapidly with the two doubly during the 24 h, then the cells proliferated and 
kept stable until 48 h. When co-cultured with suspended leukocytes after three 
days, the monocytes could derive to typical macrophages, of which the size 
enlarged significantly and showed various forms such as like fried eggs, and 
giant irregular shape with pseudopod because cells fusion or deformation 
occurred until macrophages died in about two weeks. Monocytes showed strong 
respiratory burst activity after treated with Phorbol ester PMA and challenged 
by bacteria respectively. In addition, macrophage of half smooth tongue sole had 
typical macrophage features such as phagocytic capability, positive esterase 
activity, and the considerable expression of M-CSFR, MHC-II, IL-6, IL-10, TNF 
and arginase genes. That arginase expression in macrophages (3d and 5d after 
differentiation) was upregulated fluctuant suggest that the cultivation was 
mixture of alternatively activated type macrophage (M2) in the majority while 
the classically activated type (M1) win the minority. Furthermore, MHC-Ⅱ, M-CSFR 
and IL-6 were significantly induced following LPS challenge. Collectively, the 
present study will be useful for the study on half smooth tongue sole immune 
systems and immune function.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment 
sequences with available biologics, including adalimumab (ADA), biosimilar 
infliximab (bsIFX), originator infliximab (IFX) and vedolizumab (VEDO) for 
luminal Crohn's disease in nine European countries.
METHODS: A Markov-model was constructed to simulate five-year medical costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on clinical efficacy were obtained 
from randomised controlled trials. Country-specific unit costs, discount rates 
and a third-party payer perspective were applied.
RESULTS: The bsIFX versus conventional therapy resulted in the most favourable 
incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) ranging from €34,580 (Hungary) to 
€77,062/QALY (Sweden). Compared to bsIFX, the bsIFX-ADA sequence was more 
cost-effective than the bsIFX-VEDO sequence with ICURs varying between €70,277 
(France) and €162,069/QALY (Germany). The ICURs of the bsIFX-ADA-VEDO sequence 
versus the bsIFX-ADA strategy were between €206,266 (The Netherlands) and 
€363,232/QALY (Spain).
CONCLUSION: We are the first to compare cost-effectiveness of multiple 
biological sequences for luminal Crohn's disease. Based on our findings, bsIFX 
can be recommended as a first-line treatment in patients unresponsive to 
conventional treatments. While biological sequences only slightly differ in 
their associated health gains, their costs vary greatly. The bsIFX-ADA-VEDO 
seems to be the most cost-effective sequence of the available biologics across 
Europe.

The practice of physical activity is one of the essential elements for health in 
general but also for the well-being and the quality of life. It is highly 
desirable to encourage physical activities in children with congenital heart 
diseases, taking into account all the benefits associated with this practice 
(quality of life, life expectancy) and this especially since these children 
often have limited capacity (due to their heart disease but also often by 
relative deconditioning). While there is a transient increase in risk of cardiac 
complications during intense activity, it would nevertheless be inappropriate to 
contra-indicate physical activities considering the well-known benefits in the 
medium and long term. The risks associated with the practice of physical 
activity must be assessed, on one hand, in terms of the severity of the heart 
disease, and on the other hand, on the nature and intensity of the activity. The 
stress test is here an essential tool because it helps to assess the physical 
capacity and cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise. The international 
recommendations for competitive sports generally give an appropriate advice for 
a specific situation but the practice of moderate activity or leisure sports 
which are highly desirable should not be neglected and be strongly encouraged.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive malignant brain 
tumor in adults, with a risible median life expectancy despite gold standard 
treatment. Novel drug-delivery methods have been explored. Here we evaluated the 
possibility to use mononuclear cells (MCs) belonging to the monocytic-dendritic 
lineage as drug-carrier.
METHODS: MCs were obtained from 10 patients harboring a GBM, and from healthy 
volunteers, considered as controls. GBM tissue was also obtained from patients. 
MCs were cultured and the adherent population on fibronectin (FN-MCs), after 
immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry characterization, was loaded with 
Paclitaxel (FN-MCs-PTX). Antiproliferative and migration activity of FN-MCs-PTX 
was evaluated in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) co-culture 
assays with red fluorescent U87 Malignant Glioma cells and primary GBM cells. 
Antiangiogenic properties of FN-MCs-PTX were tested on cultures with endothelial 
cells.
RESULTS: Phenotypical characterization showed a high expression of 
monocytic-dendritic markers in GBM cells and FN-MCs. FN-MCs demonstrated to 
effectively uptake PTX and to strongly inhibit GBM growth in vitro (P <0.01). 
Moreover, tumor-induced migration of MCs, although partially affected by the PTX 
cargo, remained statistically significant when compared with unprimed cells and 
this was confirmed in a 3D Matrigel model (P <0.01) and in a Trans-well assay 
(P <0.01). FN-MCs-PTX also disclosed considerable antiangiogenic properties.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the fibronectin-adherent population of MCs 
isolated from peripheral blood can be an effective tool to inhibit GBM growth. 
Given the relative facility to obtain such cells and the short time needed for 
their culture and drug loading this approach may have potential as an adjuvant 
therapy for GBM.

    Nat Commun. 2017 Jan 30;8:14332.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that have beneficial effects on host health, 
including extended lifespan, when they are administered or present in adequate 
quantities. However, the mechanisms by which probiotics stimulate host longevity 
remain unclear and very poorly understood. In a recent study (Nat. Commun. 8, 
14332 (2017) doi: 10.1038/ncomms14332), we used the spore-forming probiotic 
bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to 
study the mechanism by which a probiotic bacterium affects host longevity. We 
found that biofilm-proficient B. subtilis colonized the C. elegans gut and 
extended the worm lifespan significantly longer than did biofilm-deficient 
isogenic strains. In addition to biofilm proficiency, the quorum-sensing 
pentapeptide CSF and nitric oxide (NO) represent the entire B. subtilis 
repertoire responsible for the extended longevity of C. elegans. B. subtilis 
grown under biofilm-supporting conditions synthesized higher levels of NO and 
CSF than under planktonic growth conditions, emphasizing the key role of the 
biofilm in slowing host aging. Significantly, the prolongevity effect of B. 
subtilis was primarily due to a downregulation of the insulin-like signaling 
system that precisely is a key partaker in the healthy longevity of human 
centenarians. These findings open the possibility to test if the regular 
consumption of B. subtilis incorporated in foods and beverages could 
significantly extend human life expectancy and contribute to stop the 
development of age-related diseases.

The Validity of Race and Hispanic-origin Reporting on Death Certificates in the 
United States: An Update.

Arias E, Heron M; National Center for Health Statistics; Hakes J; US Census 
Bureau.

Objectives This report presents the findings of an updated study of the validity 
of race and Hispanic-origin reporting on death certificates in the United 
States, and its impact on race- and Hispanic origin-specific death rates. 
Methods The latest version of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS) 
was used to evaluate the classification of race and Hispanic origin on death 
certificates for deaths occurring in 1999–2011 to decedents in NLMS. To evaluate 
change over time, these results were compared with those of a study based on an 
earlier version of NLMS that evaluated the quality of race and ethnicity 
classification on death certificates for 1979–1989 and 1990–1998. NLMS consists 
of a series of annual Current Population Survey files (1973 and 1978–2011) and a 
sample of the 1980 decennial census linked to death certificates for 1979–2011. 
Pooled 2009–2011 vital statistics mortality data and 2010 decennial census 
population data were used to estimate and compare observed and corrected race- 
and Hispanic origin-specific death rates. Results Race and ethnicity reporting 
on death certificates continued to be highly accurate for both white and black 
populations during the 1999–2011 period. Misclassification remained high at 40% 
for the American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) population. It improved, from 5% 
to 3%, for the Hispanic population, and from 7% to 3% for the Asian or Pacific 
Islander (API) population. Decedent characteristics such as place of residence 
and nativity affected the quality of reporting on the death certificate. Effects 
of misclassification on death rates were large for the AIAN population but not 
significant for the Hispanic or API populations.

United States Life Tables, 2013.

Arias E, Heron M, Xu J.

Objectives-This report presents complete period life tables for the United 
States by race, Hispanic origin, and sex, based on agespecific death rates in 
2013. Methods-Data used to prepare the 2013 life tables are 2013 final mortality 
statistics; July 1, 2013 population estimates based on the 2010 decennial 
census; and 2013 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to 
estimate the 2013 life tables was first implemented with data year 2008. The 
methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains 
unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic 
origin for data year 2006. Results-In 2013, the overall expectation of life at 
birth was 78.8 years, unchanged from 2012. Between 2012 and 2013, life 
expectancy at birth remained the same for both males (76.4) and females (81.2), 
for the black population (75.5), the Hispanic population (81.9), and the 
non-Hispanic black population (75.1). Life expectancy at birth declined for both 
the white population (79.1 to 79.0) and the non-Hispanic white population (78.9 
to 78.8).

OBJECTIVE: Patellofemoral (PF) joint osteoarthritis (OA) is common, yet little 
is known about how this condition influences lower-extremity biomechanical 
function. This study compared pelvis and lower-extremity kinematics in people 
with and without PF joint OA.
METHODS: Sixty-nine participants (64% women, mean ± SD age 56 ± 10 years) with 
anterior knee pain aggravated by PF joint-loaded activities (e.g., stair 
ambulation, rising from sitting, or squatting) and radiographic lateral PF joint 
OA on skyline radiographs were compared with 18 controls (78% women, mean ± SD 
age 53 ± 7 years) with no lower-extremity pain or radiographic OA. Knee Injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) data were collected from participants 
with PF joint OA. Quantitative gait analyses were conducted during overground 
walking at a self-selected speed. Pelvis and lower-extremity kinematics were 
calculated across the stance phase. Data were statistically analyzed using 
analyses of covariance, with age and sex as covariates (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: Participants with PF joint OA reported a mean ± SD KOOS pain subscale 
score of 65 ± 15, KOOS symptoms subscale score of 63 ± 16, KOOS activities of 
daily living subscale score of 73 ± 13, KOOS sports/recreation subscale score of 
45 ± 23, and KOOS quality of life subscale score of 43 ± 16. Participants with 
PF joint OA walked with greater anterior pelvic tilt throughout the stance 
phase, as well as greater lateral pelvic tilt (i.e., pelvis lower on the 
contralateral side), greater hip adduction, and lower hip extension during the 
late stance phase. No differences in knee and ankle joint angles were observed 
between groups.
CONCLUSION: People with PF joint OA walk with altered pelvic and hip movement 
patterns compared with aged-matched controls. Restoring normal movement patterns 
during walking in people with PF joint OA may be warranted to help alleviate 
symptoms.

Population attributable risk associated with lung cancer induced by residential 
radon in Canada: Sensitivity to relative risk model and radon probability 
density function choices: In memory of Professor Jan M. Zielinski.

Indoor radon has been identified as the second leading cause of lung cancer 
after tobacco smoking. The Population Attributable Risk (PAR) estimates the 
proportion of lung cancer cases associated with indoor radon exposure. Different 
relative risk (RR) models have been used in the literature to calculate PAR. The 
aim of this study is to assess how sensitive PAR is to the relative risk model 
and radon probability distribution functions choices.
METHODS: Using Canadian observed first floor radon data collected by Health 
Canada during the period October 2010 to March 2011, seven common PAR radon 
models used for North American miners and dwelling scenarios were applied. The 
death rates used for this study were from the period 2006-2009. Smoking data 
(Ever Smoking ES and Never Smoking NS) collected in 2009 was also used in this 
study. The original discrete radon data for Canada overall and for each of its 
provinces are estimated using log-normal and Gaussian kernel density estimator 
distributions. PAR was then calculated for Canada and its provinces using the 
empirical, log-normal, and Gaussian kernel estimates distributions. Finally, 
cancer death cases attributable to radon are reported for the constant relative 
risk model for the three distributions and the reduction in the cases when the 
action level 200Bq/m3 is applied.
RESULTS: PAR for the Canadian data is sensitive to the model choice, and it 
varies with a range of 10% for ES and 32% for NS, respectively. There is little 
difference in results between miners' models and dwelling models. PAR values for 
ES females are greater than those for ES males, except in Saskatchewan, 
Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. The male-female range overlaps. 
Gaussian kernel estimator produces PAR estimates similar to the commonly used 
log-normal distribution.
CONCLUSION: Many lung cancer cases could be prevented in Canada by reducing 
indoor radon. PAR is sensitive to the choice of RR model. Miners' models can be 
used for residential radon. Empirical, log-normal, and Gaussian kernel density 
estimation with support [0,∞) can all be applied to radon data.

Introduction Because of recent increases in life expectancy, lumbar spinal 
stenosis (LSS) has become one of the most common degenerative changes in the 
spine. In patients not responding to conservative therapy, microsurgical 
decompression is the gold standard of operative treatment for degenerative LSS. 
The goal of the current study is to evaluate quality of life after microsurgical 
decompression for LSS, using data from the DWG Register (previously Spine 
Tango). Methods 36 patients were included in this single-center, prospective, 
observational study from January 2013 to June 2014. Data were collected from the 
Spine Tango or DWG Register. The core outcome measure index (COMI), Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI), and the quality of life questionnaire EuroQoL-5D were 
used. Data were collected prior to surgery as well as six weeks, six months, and 
twelve months after the operation. Results The patient cohort comprised 13 
females and 23 males (36.1 and 63.9 %). Complete 12-month follow-up data on 21 
patients were available for analysis. Compared to preoperative measures, the 
COMI score increased 8.1 ± 1.5 over the entire follow up, with 4.5 ± 3.1 at 6 
weeks (p < 0.001), 4.8 ± 3.1 at 6 months, and 3.8 ± 3.2 at 12 months. ODI 
scores, measuring spinal function impairment, were significantly better than 
preoperative values overall (47.5 ± 17.3) and after 6 weeks (29.1 ± 22.4; 
p < 0.005), 6 months (30.0 ± 19.3), and 12 months (23.8 ± 18.2). Quality of life 
measures improved in a similar manner (preoperative: 0.36 ± 0.38; 6 weeks: 
0.57 ± 0.34 (p < 0.019); 6 months: 0.62 ± 0.28; 12 months: 0.67 ± 0.31). 
Conclusion Our study shows that LSS patients without previous surgery and 
neurologic deficits can expect significant pain relief and improved quality of 
life already six weeks after undergoing stabilizing decompression. There was an 
increase in positive postoperative effects over 12 months. The DWG Register 
provides a standardized and validated means to compare non-operative and 
operative treatments of the spine over the long term.

Publisher: Einleitung Die lumbale Spinalkanalstenose (SKS) hat sich in den 
letzten Jahren durch die gestiegene Lebenserwartung und die höheren Ansprüche an 
die Lebensqualität zu einer der häufigsten degenerativen 
Wirbelsäulenveränderungen entwickelt. Bei therapierefraktären Patienten der 
konservativen Therapie ist die mikrochirurgische Dekompression der Goldstandard 
in der operativen Behandlung der degenerativen lumbalen Spinalkanalstenose. Ziel 
der vorgelegten Studie ist die Bewertung der Lebensqualität nach 
mikrochirurgischer Dekompression bei lumbaler Spinalkanalstenose anhand der 
Instrumente des DWG-Registers (vorher Spine Tango). Methode 36 Patienten wurden 
in diese monozentrische prospektive Beobachtungsstudie von Januar 2013 bis Juni 
2014 eingeschlossen. Die Datenerhebung erfolgte über das Spine Tango- bzw. 
DWG-Register. Es wurden der Core Outcome Measure Index (COMI), Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) und der Lebensqualitätsfragebogen EuroQoL-5D erhoben. 
Dies erfolgte vor der Operation sowie 6 Wochen, 6 Monate und 12 Monate nach der 
Operation. Ergebnisse Im untersuchten Kollektiv fanden sich 13 weibliche und 23 
männliche Patienten (36,1 vs. 63,9 %). Für 21 Patienten konnte ein vollständiges 
Follow-up über den 12-Monats-Zeitraum erhoben werden. Der COMI-Score besserte 
sich von 8,1 ± 1,5 präoperativ signifikant über das gesamte Follow-up (6 Wochen: 
4,5 ± 3,1 (p < 0,001), 6 Monate: 4,8 ± 3,1, 12 Monate: 3,8 ± 3,2). Auch die 
Beeinträchtigung der Rückenfunktion gemessen im ODI-Score war gegenüber den 
präoperativen Werten (47,5 ± 17,3) nach 6 Wochen (29,1 ± 22,4; p < 0,005), 6 
Monaten (30,0 ± 19,3) und 12 Monaten (23,8 ± 18,2) signifikant besser. 
Gleichermaßen verhielt es sich mit der Lebensqualität (präoperativ: 0,36 ± 0,38; 
6 Wochen: 0,57 ± 0,34 (p < 0,019), 6 Monate: 0,62 ± 0,28, 12 Monate: 
0,67 ± 0,31). Schlussfolgerung Unsere Untersuchung zeigt, dass Patienten ohne 
Voroperationen und neurologisches Defizit mit lumbaler Spinalkanalstenose eine 
erhebliche Linderung von Schmerzen und eine Steigerung der Lebensqualität 
bereits nach 6 Wochen nach stabilitätserhaltender Dekompression erwarten dürfen. 
Dieser positive postoperative Effekt zeigt sich über 12 Monate weiter 
progredient. Das DWG-Register bietet eine standardisierte und validierte 
Möglichkeit, konservative wie operative Behandlungen an der Wirbelsäule 
langfristig vergleichbar zu machen.

Assessing the Likelihood and Magnitude of a Population Health Benefit Following 
the Market Introduction of a Modified-Risk Tobacco Product: Enhancements to the 
Dynamic Population Modeler, DPM(+1).

Researchers and those responsible for evaluating and implementing policies 
intended to reduce population harm must assess the potential for both intended 
and unintended consequences associated with those policies. Such assessments 
should be based on the combined dimensions of magnitude, and thus likelihood, of 
shifts in exposure patterns needed to produce a population benefit or harm, and 
magnitude of the expected population benefit or harm. In response to this 
assessment need, we provide a conceptual description of the dynamic population 
modeler, DPM(+1), as well as illustrative analyses that estimate the effects on 
all-cause mortality, life expectancy, and quality of life-adjusted life 
expectancy if exposure patterns in the population shift from a higher risk 
product (e.g., cigarettes) to a lower, or modified, risk tobacco product (MRTP) 
in specified ways. Estimates from these analyses indicate that, within a single 
birth cohort, switching completely from cigarette smoking to MRTP use is more 
likely to lead to a population-level survival benefit than initiating tobacco 
use with an MRTP instead of cigarettes. This is because tobacco initiation 
rarely occurs beyond young adulthood, whereas continuing smokers exist in all 
subsequent age categories, leading to a greater cumulative effect. In addition, 
complete switching to MRTP use among a small proportion of smokers in each age 
category offsets the survival deficit caused by unintended shifts in exposure 
patterns, such as MRTP initiation among never tobacco users followed by 
transitioning to cigarette smoking and/or cigarette smokers switching to MRTP 
use instead of quitting.
