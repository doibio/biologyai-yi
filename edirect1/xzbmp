Mitochondrial disorders are an important group of genetic conditions 
characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial disorders 
come with an impressive variability of symptoms, organ involvement, and clinical 
course, which considerably impact the quality of life and quite often shorten 
the lifespan expectancy. Although the last 20 years have witnessed an 
exponential increase in understanding the genetic and biochemical mechanisms 
leading to disease, this has not resulted in the development of effective 
therapeutic approaches, amenable of improving clinical course and outcome of 
these conditions to any significant extent. Therapeutic options for 
mitochondrial diseases still remain focused on supportive interventions aimed at 
relieving complications. However, new therapeutic strategies have recently been 
emerging, some of which have shown potential efficacy at the pre-clinical level. 
This review will present the state of the art on experimental therapy for 
mitochondrial disorders.

with chronic heart failure in Sweden.

Institute for Health Economics , Lund , Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: Iron deficiency is a common but treatable comorbidity in chronic 
heart failure (CHF) that is associated with impaired health-related 
quality-of-life (HRQoL). This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the 
intravenous iron preparation ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) for the treatment of 
iron deficiency in CHF from a Swedish healthcare perspective.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis with a time horizon of 24 weeks was 
performed to compare FCM treatment with placebo. Data on health outcomes and 
medical resource use were mainly taken from the FAIR-HF trial and combined with 
Swedish cost data. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated 
as well as the change in per-patient costs for primary care and hospital care.
RESULTS: In the FCM group compared with placebo, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) are higher (difference = 0.037 QALYs), but so are per-patient costs 
[(difference = SEK 2789 (€303)]. Primary care and hospital care equally share 
the additional costs, but within hospitals there is a major shift of costs from 
inpatient care to outpatient care. The ICER is SEK 75,389 (€8194) per QALY. The 
robustness of the result is supported by sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of iron deficiency in CHF with FCM compared with placebo 
is estimated to be cost-effective. The ICER in the base case scenario is twice 
as high as previously thought, but noticeably below SEK 500,000 (€54,300) per 
QALY, an informal average reference value used by the Swedish Dental and 
Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency. Increased HRQoL and fewer hospitalizations are 
the key drivers of this result.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) improves 
healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The current literature provides 
ample but inconsistent data on this topic.
PURPOSE: To systematically review the current in vivo evidence for the use of 
platelet concentrates (PRP) in the arthroscopic treatment of rotator cuff tears 
to assess effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness.
STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: Published evidence from controlled, human trials of rotator cuff repair 
augmented with platelet concentrates was systematically gathered, and data on 
retear rates were extracted. Mathematical and clinical heterogeneity was 
evaluated, and fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate the risk 
ratio (RR) of retears and the number needed to treat (NNT). Subgroup analyses 
were made for small/medium tears (n = 404) and large/massive tears (n = 374). 
Cost-effectiveness was assessed using data from this meta-analysis and using 
cost data from the literature, including extensive sensitivity analyses, to 
calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Thirteen studies published between 2010 and 2014 were identified for 
analysis. The RR for retear for all patients was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.67-1.12; P = 
.286). For small- and medium-sized tears (<3 cm), the RR for retear was 0.60 
(95% CI, 0.37-0.97), consistent with a significant difference in favor of PRP 
use (P = .038). This translated into an NNT of 14 (95% CI, 7-125). However, at 
an ICER of US$127,893 per quality-adjusted life year gained, assuming a 5% 
revision rate, the use of PRP was not cost-effective for small- and medium-sized 
tears.
CONCLUSION: In large tears, even with double-row repair, the beneficial effects 
of PRP alone are insufficient to compensate the progressed tissue damage. The 
study data suggest that PRP may promote healing of small- and medium-sized tears 
to reduce retear rates. However, despite the substantial biological effect, at 
current cost, the use of PRP is not cost-effective in arthroscopic repair of 
small- and medium-sized tears.

The effect of strength training on body image is understudied. The Strong Women 
Program, a 10-week, twice weekly strength-training program, was provided by 
Extension agents to 341 older rural women (62±12 years); changes in body image 
and other psychosocial variables were evaluated. Paired-sample t-test analyses 
were conducted to assess mean differences pre- to post-program. Strength 
training was associated with significant improvements in several dimensions of 
body image, health-related quality of life, and physical activity behaviors, 
satisfaction, and comfort among rural aging women-an often underserved 
population that stands to benefit considerably from similar programs.

OBJECTIVES: To calculate the potential years of life lost (PYLL) due to suicide 
in China, and analyse the distribution of PYLL by age, sex and region.
STUDY DESIGN: The recent Chinese national mortality data (2006-2010) published 
by the Chinese Ministry of Health and the census data provided by the Chinese 
National Population Census were used to calculate PYLL due to suicide.
METHODS: Age-, sex- and region-specific PYLL due to suicide in China were 
determined for victims aged between 1 and 74 years.
RESULTS: Suicide was found to be the 10th leading cause of death in terms of 
PYLL, and accounted for 3.06% of all PYLL in China. There were three age peaks 
for PYLL due to suicide in rural areas (20-24, 35-44 and 50-59 years), and two 
peaks for PYLL due to suicide in urban areas (20-24 and 35-44 years). PYLL due 
to suicide in rural areas was approximately two-fold higher than PYLL due to 
suicide in urban areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Suicide is a major public health problem in China. This needs to be 
controlled, especially in rural areas.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
balloon angioplasty as the primary method of intervention in patients with color 
duplex ultrasound documented failing bypass grafts and to determine factors that 
may affect the patency of lower extremity bypass grafts revised by percutaneous 
transluminal angioplasty (PTA).
METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent lower extremity bypass grafts 
from January 2009 to December 2013 were enrolled in a graft surveillance 
program. Patients identified as having failing grafts underwent arteriography to 
confirm the diagnosis with a view to concomitant treatment of the lesion using 
balloon angioplasty. Procedural success was defined as <30% residual stenosis. 
Treatment failure was defined as target lesion restenosis or graft occlusion. 
Descriptive and life-table analyses were performed.
RESULTS: PTA was used to revise 96 failing grafts in 90 patients. Mean age was 
65.8 years (range, 50-88 years), 64% were male, and 66% were symptomatic. Mean 
follow-up was 18.5 months (range, 3-24 months). Twenty-four grafts (25%) 
underwent repeat angioplasty for restenosis. Grafts with multiple lesions (P = 
.009) and grafts aged <6 months from the index operation (P = .004) were the 
only graft-related variables that showed a significant effect on the longevity 
of the endovascular revision. The PTA-revised grafts had primary, assisted 
primary, and secondary patency rates of 56.9%, 83.2%, and 90%, respectively, at 
2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary balloon angioplasty of failing lower extremity bypass 
grafts, notwithstanding the higher restenosis rate and the need for 
reintervention, appears to be safe and is associated with acceptable early and 
medium-term patency rates. Grafts with multiple lesions and those revised ≤6 
months of the index operation showed a significant association with the need for 
a second revision at the same site.

OBJECTIVE: Although evidence has shown that ischemic heart disease (IHD) in 
vascular surgery patients has a negative impact on the prognosis after surgery, 
it is unclear whether directed treatment of IHD may influence cause-specific and 
overall mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic 
implication of coronary revascularization (CR) on overall and cause-specific 
mortality in vascular surgery patients.
METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid 
artery stenosis, or peripheral artery disease in a university hospital in The 
Netherlands between January 2003 and December 2011 were retrospectively 
included. Survival estimates were obtained by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1104 patients were included. Adjusted survival analyses 
showed that IHD significantly increased the risk of overall mortality (hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.87) and cardiovascular death 
(HR, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.76). Compared with those without CR, 
patients previously undergoing CR had similar overall mortality (HR, 1.38 vs 
1.62; P = .274) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.83 vs 2.02; P = .656). 
Nonrevascularized IHD patients were more likely to die of IHD (6.9% vs 35.7%), 
whereas revascularized IHD patients more frequently died of cardiovascular 
causes unrelated to IHD (39.1% vs 64.3%; P = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the significance of IHD for postoperative 
survival of vascular surgery patients. CR was associated with lower IHD-related 
death rates. However, it failed to provide an overall survival benefit because 
of an increased rate of cardiovascular mortality unrelated to IHD. 
Intensification of secondary prevention regimens may be required to prevent this 
shift toward non-IHD-related death and thereby improve life expectancy.

During aging the ability of organisms to maintain the protein homeostasis 
declines and damaged and misfolded proteins accumulate in cells. But whether the 
deterioration of protein homeostasis is the cause or consequence of aging is not 
clearly understood. Mitochondrial dysfunctions usually lead to increased 
longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans, the cause of which is believed to be the 
activation of protein homeostasis protective mechanisms including mitochondrial 
unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) and GCN-2 kinase mediated nutrient-sensing 
pathway. However, we investigated four genes which encode well-defined 
mitochondrial proteins and found that: (i) UPR(mt) activation was associated 
with not only increased longevity by knockdown of mfn-1, cco-1, or nuo-6, but 
also decreased longevity by mev-1 RNAi; (ii) The blockage of UPR(mt) pathway did 
not repress mfn-1, cco-1, or nuo-6 RNAi induced lifespan extension; (iii) The 
activation of UPR(mt) did not increase longevity; (iv) Knockdown of mfn-1, 
cco-1, or nuo-6 increased longevity independently of GCN-2. The combined results 
indicate that two important kinds of the protein homeostasis protective 
mechanisms, namely UPR(mt) and GCN-2 pathways, are not responsible for 
mitochondrial deficiency induced lifespan extension. The enhanced protection of 
protein homeostasis may be insufficient to slow aging, and there may be other 
mechanisms that contribute to the increased longevity in response to 
mitochondrial dysfunctions.

Knowledge, Self-efficacy, and Self-perceived Risk for Cardiovascular Disease 
among Asians Living With HIV: The Influence of HIV Stigma and Acculturation.

Kamitani E, Fukuoka Y, Dawson-Rose C.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have become major 
health concerns for people living with HIV (PLWH) as life expectancy has 
increased with antiretroviral therapy. Studies suggest that motivation to seek 
health care is associated with knowledge, self-efficacy to engage in the health 
care system, and self-perceived risks for CVD and ACS. Using cross-sectional 
data collected from 67 un-/under-insured Asian PLWH in California, we explored 
the levels of knowledge about CVD, self-efficacy for recognizing ACS symptoms 
and seeking health care, and self-perceived risk for CVD and ACS, and how HIV 
stigmatization and acculturation predict these three constructs. Our sample had 
limited knowledge and low self-perceived risk but had high self-efficacy. 
Stigmatization was negatively correlated with self-efficacy (p = .004) and 
acculturation was a positive predictor of knowledge (p = .013). Economically 
vulnerable Asian PLWH need culturally appropriate interventions to improve their 
knowledge and self-perceived risks for CVD and ACS.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness outcomes 
of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in the treatment of primary 
spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), comparing the minimally invasive procedure with 
pleural drainage (PD).
METHODS: Between July 2006 and October 2012, we treated 122 patients with a 
first episode of PSP by VATS (61 patients) or pleural drainage (61 patients). We 
established the relationship between costs and quality-adjusted life (QAL) for 
both techniques.
RESULTS: The total cost per patient of minimally invasive procedure was more 
advantageous than that of chest tube (€2,422.96 vs €4,855.12). The QAL 
expectancy of VATS was longer than that of PD (57.00 vs 40.80 at 60 months). The 
QAL year of VATS (.32 at 1st year and .25 at 5th year) was better than that of 
PD. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of VATS versus PD was between €7,600.00 
(1st year) and €10,045.00 (5th year), remaining well below the threshold of 
acceptability.
CONCLUSION: VATS as the first-line treatment for PSP allowed low morbidity, 
short hospitalization, and excellent quality of life.

Transitional care in pediatric urology.

Pediatric Urology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Morgan Stanley Children's 
Hospital, New York, New York. Electronic address: sml72@columbia.edu.

The transition from childhood to adolescence and into adulthood occurs as a 
natural component of human development. As children progress through school and 
gain independence, health care practitioners must facilitate a parallel 
transition from pediatric to adult providers. Modern medicine has succeeded in 
extending the life expectancy for many children with complex conditions, and 
adult providers are participating in their medical care through adulthood. 
Transitioning pediatric urology care to adult urology care is unique to every 
individual and his or her underlying condition, while the transition process is 
universal. The objectives of all pediatric urologists include preservation of 
the kidneys and lower urinary tracts, safe urine storage, safe urine drainage, 
urinary continence, fertility, sexual function, and genital cosmesis. For some 
children, these objectives can be attained during childhood, while other 
children require lifelong maintenance and management. Children with posterior 
urethral valves, exstrophy-epispadias complex, cloaca, vesicoureteral reflux, 
neurogenic bladder, disorders of sex development, cancer, hypospadias, 
nephrolithiasis, undescended testes, varicoceles, ureteropelvic junction 
obstruction, solitary kidney, and upper tract anomalies all require long-term 
evaluation and management. The obstacles of altering a patient and caregiver 
paradigm, locating adult urologists with special expertise, coordinating care 
with other adult specialties such as nephrology, and navigating the adult health 
care environment can impede the transition process.

We present endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a 26-year-old 
man with a 10-year follow-up. A young patient presenting with an abdominal 
aortic aneurysm is extremely rare, and data describing this population are 
limited. Open aneurysm repair (OAR) is the treatment of choice in these 
patients. However, since its introduction, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) 
has revolutionized the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The long-term 
durability and late complications after EVAR may have more significance when 
considering the optimal treatment for young patients with a longer life 
expectancy. Our good long-term outcome will help to support the use of EVAR as a 
reasonable alternative to OAR in young patients with suitable anatomic findings.

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the time course of clinical events in cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT) trials.
BACKGROUND: Recent randomized controlled trial results suggest that in heart 
failure with narrow QRS, biventricular pacing (CRT) may increase mortality. The 
authors proposed implant complications as the cause, rather than a progressive 
adverse physiological effect.
METHODS: The study identified all trials comparing CRT with no CRT, which 
reported Kaplan-Meier curves in groups defined by QRS: narrow, non-left bundle 
branch block (LBBB) broad, and LBBB broad. For each trial, the change in life 
span every 3 months up to 3.5 years (the longest time for which data are 
available) was calculated and a power law was fitted, that is, ∝ time(n).
RESULTS: Four trials (MADIT-CRT [Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator 
Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy], RAFT 
[Resynchronization-Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial], REVERSE 
[REsynchronization reVErses Remodeling in Systolic left vEntricular 
dysfunction], and EchoCRT [Echocardiography Guided Cardiac Resynchronization 
Therapy]), totaling 4,717 patients, reported curves for mortality or heart 
failure-related hospitalization, or for mortality. In patients with LBBB broad 
QRS (within MADIT-CRT), life span gain increased in proportion to time(1.94). In 
contrast, in patients with non-LBBB broad QRS (within MADIT-CRT) and patients 
with narrow QRS (EchoCRT), life span was lost in proportion to time(1.92) and 
time,(1.96) respectively. Hospitalization-free survival showed similar patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear growth of life span gained when a CRT device is 
implanted in patients with LBBB broad QRS is unfortunately mirrored by a 
similarly progressive loss in life span in narrow QRS heart failure. This 
suggests the culprit is a progressive physiological effect of pacing rather than 
implant complications. If these data are not sufficient, a randomized controlled 
trial of deactivating CRT in patients with narrow QRS may now be needed, with a 
primary endpoint of increasing survival.

The ancient city of Rome, its empire, and the spread of tuberculosis in Europe.

The formation of the Roman Empire constituted an unprecedented joining of 
Mediterranean and European lands and peoples, centering on the capital of Rome. 
During the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire (ca. 200B.C.-ca. 200 A.D.) 
urbanization and population growth led to conditions favorable to the spread of 
tuberculosis throughout Italy and especially within Rome itself. Trade and 
military expansion would have acted as vehicles for the further extension of 
tuberculosis to the provinces via direct transmission from Italian-born Romans 
to the native populations. However, an alternative explanation may better 
explain the increase in the number of archeological cases of tuberculosis with 
the start of the Roman era. A literature review of Roman-era cases and their 
locations suggests that the development of an urban, Roman way of life resulted 
in significant increases in prevalence in regions where tuberculosis had 
previously been endemic only at a low level.

Cost-effectiveness of Sativex in multiple sclerosis spasticity: new data and 
application to Italy.

Spain.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease that carries a high 
socioeconomic burden. Spasticity (rigidity and spasms) is common in MS and 
contributes to MS-related disability. This study aims to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of Sativex(®) (9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol plus cannabidiol 
oromucosal spray) when used as add-on therapy for management of resistant 
MS-related spasticity in the context of the Italian healthcare system. A 
previously published Markov model-based analysis for the German and Spanish 
context was replicated, adapting it to the Italian setting. Model parameters 
were updated to reflect recent findings about MS-related spasticity and use of 
Sativex in daily clinical practice. The base case incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for Sativex use in Italy over a 5-year period was estimated to be €4968 
per quality-adjusted life-year gained (year of costing: 2013). Sativex remained 
an efficient option in the Italian healthcare context - below the commonly 
accepted incremental threshold of €30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained 
- when deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. 
Sativex can be regarded as a cost-effective treatment option for patients with 
MS-related spasticity in Italy.

PURPOSE: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes 
to the spine often requiring surgery. However, selecting the appropriate 
surgical intervention can be challenging. The Tokuhashi scoring system can be 
used to predict survival and inform the surgical strategy. We set out to 
determine the Tokuhashi score for patients with RCC spine metastases and compare 
expected and observed survival.
METHODS: Records were reviewed for all patients who underwent surgery for spinal 
metastases at a single institution from January 2000 to December 2011 to 
determine the Tokuhashi score and survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank 
test for univariate analysis were performed with R version 2.15.12 (R 
Foundation, 2012).
RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent 40 spinal operations for metastatic RCC. 
Median survival was 11.4 months. Preoperative Tokuhashi scores were: 12-15, 15 
patients; 9-11, seven patients; 0-8, eight patients. Median survival was 32.9, 
11.7, and 5.4 months, respectively. Bone (p=0.01) and visceral metastases 
(p=0.005), and KPS (p=0.002) significantly affected survival. Tokuhashi score 
predicted survival (p=0.016); survival differed between the high and low score 
groups (p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: RCC is an aggressive disease with short life expectancy when 
metastatic to the spine. However, patients with low systemic disease burden and 
solitary spinal metastases can have long survival and benefit from excisional 
surgery. Tokuhashi score can be useful in selecting surgical intervention in 
patients with RCC spinal metastases, and may be more relevant than in other 
cancers with spinal metastases.

The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a conserved protein complex that stabilizes 
interactions along homologous chromosomes (homologs) during meiosis. The SC 
regulates genetic exchanges between homologs, thereby enabling reductional 
division and the production of haploid gametes. Here, we directly observe SC 
assembly (synapsis) by optimizing methods for long-term fluorescence recording 
in C. elegans. We report that synapsis initiates independently on each 
chromosome pair at or near pairing centers-specialized regions required for 
homolog associations. Once initiated, the SC extends rapidly and mostly 
irreversibly to chromosome ends. Quantitation of SC initiation frequencies and 
extension rates reveals that initiation is a rate-limiting step in homolog 
interactions. Eliminating the dynein-driven chromosome movements that accompany 
synapsis severely retards SC extension, revealing a new role for these conserved 
motions. This work provides the first opportunity to directly observe and 
quantify key aspects of meiotic chromosome interactions and will enable future 
in vivo analysis of germline processes.

The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated a mortality 
reduction benefit associated with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening 
for lung cancer. There has been considerable debate regarding the benefits and 
harms of LDCT lung cancer screening, including the challenges related to its 
practical implementation. One of the controversies regards overdiagnosis, which 
conceptually denotes diagnosing a cancer that, either because of its indolent, 
low-aggressiveness biologic behavior or because of limited life expectancy, is 
unlikely to result in significant morbidity during the patient's remainder 
lifetime. In theory, diagnosing and treating these cancers offer no measurable 
benefit while incurring costs and risks. Therefore, if a screening test detects 
a substantial number of overdiagnosed cancers, it is less likely to be 
effective. It has been argued that LDCT screening for lung cancer results in an 
unacceptably high rate of overdiagnosis. This article aims to defend the 
opposite stance. Overdiagnosis does exist and to a certain extent is inherent to 
any cancer-screening test. Nonetheless, the concept is less dualistic and more 
nuanced than it has been suggested. Furthermore, the average estimates of 
overdiagnosis in LDCT lung cancer screening based on the totality of published 
data are likely much lower than the highest published estimates, if a careful 
definition of a positive screening test reflecting our current understanding of 
lung cancer biology is utilized. This article presents evidence on why reports 
of overdiagnosis in lung cancer screening have been exaggerated.

Non-ICU hospital care of diabetes mellitus in the elderly population.

Gilden JL(1), Gupta A.

The concept of lower is better when considering the goal for glycemic control in 
patients with diabetes mellitus has recently been challenged due to recent 
studies, such as ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT, which have observed increased 
morbidity and mortality from intensive control, especially in older adults, and 
in those with long duration of diabetes disease and chronic complications. 
Although evidence in younger patients suggest that blood glucose levels should 
not be above 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l), there are many unanswered questions and 
controversies regarding the benefits and risks, methods to achieve and maintain 
these levels while avoiding hypoglycemia (<70 mg% (3.9 mmol/l)) in the older 
population. Since the population is aging with a greater life expectancy, it is 
crucial that these questions be answered. Although several studies of inpatient 
non-ICU diabetes management have been published, few include older patients. 
This review will examine available recommendations and explore those 
controversies regarding non-ICU hospital management in this vulnerable patient 
population. Additional conditions that impact upon achieving glycemic control 
will also be discussed. Finally, the older individual has many special needs 
which may be more important to consider than in young or middle-aged 
individuals, when transitioning care from in-hospital to home in a 
patient-centered approach, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association 
(ADA) and European Society for the Study of Diabetes (EASD).

Type 2 diabetes is a pandemic disease, and its prevalence is increasing mainly 
due to an increase in obesity and life expectancy. Diabetic complications and 
their comorbidities constitute the most important economic cost of the disease 
and represent a significant economic burden for the healthcare systems of 
developed countries. Despite improving standards of care, people with diabetes 
remain at risk of the development and progression of microvascular diabetic 
complications. Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic approaches is 
necessary. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the clinical 
benefits of fenofibrate on microvascular diabetic complications, with special 
emphasis on diabetic retinopathy. In addition, the potential mechanisms of 
action will be briefly discussed.

The ethical implications and religious significance of organ transplantation 
payment systems.

#3203, New Orleans, LA, 70130, USA. hsmith5@tulane.edu.

One of the more polarizing policies proposed to alleviate the organ shortage is 
financial payment of donors in return for organs. A priori and empirical 
investigation concludes that such systems are ethically inadequate. A new 
methodological approach towards policy formation and implementation is proposed 
which places ethical concerns at its core. From a hypothetical secular origin, 
the optimal ethical policy structure concerning organ donation is derived. 
However, when applied universally, it does not yield ideal results for every 
culture and society due to region-specific variation. Since religion holds 
significant influence in the organ donation debate, three religions-Catholicism, 
Islam, and Shinto-were examined in order to illustrate this variation. Although 
secular ethical concerns should rest at the core of policy construction, certain 
region-specific contexts require cultural and religious competence and 
necessitate the adjustment of the optimal template policy accordingly to yield 
the best moral and practical results.

BACKGROUND: Patients, physicians, and other decision makers make implicit but 
inevitable trade-offs among risks and benefits of treatments. Many methods have 
been proposed to promote transparent and rigorous benefit-risk analysis (BRA).
OBJECTIVE: To propose a framework for classifying BRA methods on the basis of 
key factors that matter most for patients by using a common mathematical 
notation and compare their results using a hypothetical example.
METHODS: We classified the available BRA methods into three categories: 1) 
unweighted metrics, which use only probabilities of benefits and risks; 2) 
metrics that incorporate preference weights and that account for the impact and 
duration of benefits and risks; and 3) metrics that incorporate weights based on 
decision makers' opinions. We used two hypothetical antiplatelet drugs (a and b) 
to compare the BRA methods within our proposed framework.
RESULTS: Unweighted metrics include the number needed to treat and the number 
needed to harm. Metrics that incorporate preference weights include those that 
use maximum acceptable risk, those that use relative-value-adjusted life-years, 
and those that use quality-adjusted life-years. Metrics that use decision 
makers' weights include the multicriteria decision analysis, the 
benefit-less-risk analysis, Boers' 3 by 3 table, the Gail/NCI method, and the 
transparent uniform risk benefit overview. Most BRA methods can be derived as a 
special case of a generalized formula in which some are mathematically 
identical. Numerical comparison of methods highlights potential differences in 
BRA results and their interpretation.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework provides a unified, patient-centered 
approach to BRA methods classification based on the types of weights that are 
used across existing methods, a key differentiating feature.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-utility analyses (CUAs) have been published widely over the 
years to measure the value of health care interventions. We investigated the 
growth and characteristics of CUAs in the peer-reviewed English-language 
literature through 2012.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis (CEA) Registry, a database containing more than 3700 English-language 
CUAs published through 2012. We summarized various study characteristics (e.g., 
intervention type, funding source, and journal of publication) and 
methodological practices (e.g., use of probabilistic sensitivity analysis) over 
three time periods: 1990 to 1999, 2000 to 2009, and 2010 to 2012. We also 
examined CUAs by country, region, and the degree to which diseases studied 
correlate with disease burden.
RESULTS: The number of published CUAs rose from 34 per year from 1990 to 1999 to 
431 per year from 2010 to 2012. The proportion of studies focused on the United 
States declined from 61% during 1990 to 1999 to 35% during 2010 to 2012 (P < 
0.0001). Although still small compared with CUAs in higher income countries, the 
number of CUAs focused on lower and middle-income countries has risen sharply. A 
large fraction of studies pertain to pharmaceuticals (46% during 2010-2012). In 
recent years, most studies included probabilistic sensitivity analysis (67% 
during 2010-2012). Journals publishing CUAs vary widely in the percentage of 
their studies funded by drug companies. Some conditions, such as injuries, have 
high burden but few CUAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review reveals considerable growth and some change in the 
cost-utility literature in recent years. The data suggest growing interest in 
cost-utility methodology, particularly in non-Western countries.

BACKGROUND: Sample size calculations for treatment trials that aim to assess 
health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) outcomes are often difficult to perform. 
Researchers must select a target minimal clinically important difference (MCID) 
in HRQOL for the trial, estimate the effect size of the intervention, and then 
consider the responsiveness of different HRQOL measures for detecting 
improvements. Generic preference-based HRQOL measures are usually less sensitive 
to gains in HRQOL than are disease-specific measures, but are nonetheless 
recommended to quantify an impact on HRQOL that can be translated into 
quality-adjusted life-years during cost-effectiveness analyses. Mapping 
disease-specific measures onto generic measures is a proposed method for 
yielding more efficient sample size requirements while retaining the ability to 
generate utility weights for cost-effectiveness analyses.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to test this mapping strategy to calculate and 
compare the effect on sample size of three different methods.
METHODS: Three different methods were used for determining an MCID in HRQOL in 
patients with incontinence: 1) a global rating of improvement, 2) an 
incontinence-specific HRQOL instrument, and 3) a generic preference-based HRQOL
