OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between sedentary behavior and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) among participants in the Osteoarthritis 
Initiative.
DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational design.
SETTING: Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals (N=1794) from a prospective, multicenter longitudinal 
cohort were classified into quantile groups based on average daily sedentary 
time (most sedentary, quartile 1 [Q1] ≥11.6h; 10.7h≤ Q2 <11.6h; 9.7h≤ Q3 <10.7h; 
least sedentary, Q4 <9.7h).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Individual QALYs were estimated over 2 years from the 
area under the curve of health-related utility scores derived from the Medical 
Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey versus time. The relationship 
between baseline sedentary behavior and median 2-year QALYs was estimated using 
quantile regression adjusted for socioeconomic factors and body mass index.
RESULTS: Lower QALYs over 2 years were more frequently found among the most 
sedentary (Q1, median 1.59), and QALYs increased as time spent in baseline 
sedentary behavior decreased (median QALYs for Q2, 1.64; Q3, 1.65; Q4, 1.65). 
The relationship of sedentary time and median QALY change was only significant 
for the most sedentary Q1 group, where an additional hour of sedentary behavior 
significantly reduced QALYs by -.072 (95% confidence interval, -.121 to -.020).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that individuals with the most extreme 
sedentary profiles may be vulnerable to additional losses of quality of life if 
they become more sedentary. Targeting these individuals to decrease sedentary 
behavior has the potential to be cost-effective.

PURPOSE: As life expectancy in cystic fibrosis (CF) increases, questions 
regarding its potential impact on cardiovascular health arise. Soluble vascular 
cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), P-selectin (sP-selectin) are proposed as 
biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. We aimed to: compare their concentrations 
in clinically stable CF patients and healthy subjects (HS) and verify whether 
they independently correlate with CF characteristics.
METHODS: Serum sVCAM-1 and sP-selectin levels were measured using ELISA. CF was 
characterized using: forced expiratory volume in 1 s, exocrine pancreatic and 
CF-related liver disease status, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, serum 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and body mass index (BMI). CFTR genotypes 
were classified as severe (classes I and II) or other.
RESULTS: 108 CF patients and 51 healthy subjects volunteered for the study. In 
the CF group BMI was lower (median [IQR]: 20.5 kg/m2 [18.4-22.2] vs. 21.6 kg/m2 
[19.9-23.4], p = 0.02) and hsCRP levels were higher (3.6 mg/L [1.1-7.1] vs. 
0.5 mg/dL [0.3-1.0], p < 10-10). While sVCAM-1 concentrations were greater in CF 
patients (1018 ng/mL [851-1279] vs. 861 ng/mL [806-979], p < 10-4), sP-selectin 
levels did not differ (155 ng/mL [129-188] vs. 156 ng/mL [144-177], p = 0.48). 
None of the multivariable regression models was valid for the prediction of 
sVCAM-1 and sP-selectin in CF.
CONCLUSIONS: We found higher sVCAM-1 concentrations in CF patients than in 
healthy subjects, which were not explained by CF characteristics. Further 
research is required to check whether sVCAM-1 is a marker of microangiopathy in 
CF.

Eftrenonacog alfa (Alprolix™) is a recombinant fusion protein comprising human 
factor IX (FIX) covalently linked to the constant region (Fc) domain of human 
IgG1 (i.e. rFIXFc). The presence of the Fc domain extends the terminal half-life 
(t½) of rFIXFc, permitting prolonged treatment intervals. rFIXFc is available 
for intravenous use for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in patients 
with haemophilia B. In two multinational, phase III studies in previously 
treated children, adolescents and adults with severe haemophilia B, rFIXFc 
prophylaxis resulted in low median annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), and was 
associated with reductions in median weekly factor consumption and dosing 
frequency compared with pre-study FIX regimens. Preliminary data from an 
extension of both studies indicated sustained efficacy, as demonstrated by low 
median ABRs, with longer-term rFIXFc prophylaxis. rFIXFc was also effective in 
the treatment of bleeding episodes and when used in the perioperative setting in 
all age groups. rFIXFc was well tolerated in clinical studies in previously 
treated patients, with the majority of treatment-emergent adverse events 
considered to be unrelated to rFIXFc; there were no reports of inhibitor 
development. In conclusion, rFIXFc provides an effective alternative to 
plasma-derived and recombinant FIX products for the management of patients with 
haemophilia B, with its extended t½ permitting a less frequent administration 
schedule and potentially providing a prolonged protective haemostatic effect, 
which eases the treatment burden on the patient.

INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy, more women with cystic fibrosis 
and diabetes mellitus become pregnant. We investigated how pre-gestational 
diabetes (cystic fibrosis-related diabetes) influenced pregnancy outcome and the 
clinical status of these women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed all pregnancies reported to the French cystic 
fibrosis registry between 2001 and 2012, and compared forced expiratory volume 
(FEV1 ) and body mass index before and after pregnancy in women with and without 
pre-gestational diabetes having a first delivery.
RESULTS: A total 249 women delivered 314 infants. Among these, 189 women had a 
first delivery and 29 of these had pre-gestational diabetes. There was a trend 
towards a higher rate of assisted conception among diabetic women (53.8%) than 
non-diabetic women (34.5%, p = 0.06), and the rate of cesarean section was 
significantly higher in diabetic women (48% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.005). The rate of 
preterm birth and mean infant birthweight did not differ significantly between 
diabetic and non-diabetic women. Forced expiratory volume before pregnancy was 
significantly lower in the diabetic group. The decline in forced expiratory 
volume and body mass index following pregnancy did not differ between the women 
with and those without pre-gestational diabetes.
CONCLUSION: Pre-gestational diabetes in women with cystic fibrosis is associated 
with a higher rate of cesarean section but does not seem to have a clinically 
significant impact on fetal growth or preterm delivery. The changes in maternal 
pulmonary and nutritional status following pregnancy in women with cystic 
fibrosis were not influenced by pre-gestational diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Lowering cholesterol levels decreases the risk of atherosclerotic 
diseases. Effective ways to stably reduce LDL-C level are warranted in type 2 
diabetic patients, a high-risk population for CVD, with various anti-diabetic 
therapeutic background. The RESEARCH study focuses on LDL-C reduction in this 
population along with modifications of the lipid profiles. We evaluated 
long-term ezetimibe add-on therapy in T2DM patients with hypercholesterolemia.
METHODS: In a randomized, multicenter, open-label, prospective study, a total of 
109 T2DM patients not attaining LDL-C target value despite first-line dose 
statin (10 mg of atorvastatin or 1 mg of pitavastatin) therapy in Japan were 
recruited. We investigated the difference in cholesterol lowering effect between 
ezetimibe (10 mg) add-on statin (EAT) group and double-dose statin (DST) group. 
Changes of parameters related to atherosclerotic event risks were assessed.
RESULTS: The reduction of LDL-C was larger in the EAT group (28.3%) than in the 
DST group (9.2%) at 52 weeks as well as the primary endpoint of 12 weeks. EAT 
achieved significant lower levels of TC and apo B, respectively. Both treatments 
attained significant reduction in sd-LDL-C or hsCRP on this long-term basis. 
Notably, sd-LDL-C in EAT reduced as low as 36.1 ± 14.9 mg/dl to reach near the 
threshold (35.0 mg/dl) for atherosclerosis with significantly higher achievement 
rate (55.6%) than DST treatment. Simultaneously, hsCRP reduction by EAT attained 
as low value as 0.52 ± 0.43 mg/l.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present 52-week long-term period, ezetimibe add-on therapy 
showed a robust advantage in lowering LDL-C and in attaining target LDL-C values 
compared with the doubling of statin dose. Moreover, it's meaningful that 
sd-LDL, powerfully atherogenic lipoprotein, exhibited prominent decrease 
consistently prominently by ezetimibe add-on therapy. DM patients with 
hypercholesterolemia are at high risk for CAD, and adding ezetimibe onto 
usual-dose statin treatment in Japan has been suggested as the first-line 
therapy for those DM patients who failed to attain the target LDL-C value 
(UMIN000002593).

Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the outcomes of endovascular exclusion of the 
entire aortic arch (proximal landing in zone 0, distal landing in zone III or 
beyond, after Ishimaru) in which complete surgical debranching of the 
supra-aortic vessels (I), endovascular supra-aortic revascularization (chimney, 
fenestrated, or branched grafts) with partial surgical debranching (II), or 
total endovascular supra-aortic revascularization (III) was additionally 
performed.
METHODS: Publications describing endovascular repair of the aortic arch 
(2000-2016) were systematically searched and reviewed.
RESULTS: From a total of 53 relevant studies including 1853 patients, only 1021 
patients undergoing 35 different total aortic arch procedures were found 
eligible for further evaluation and included in group I, II, or III (429, 190, 
and 402 patients, respectively). Overall early mortality was higher in group I 
vs groups II and III (P = .001; 1 - β = 95.6%) but exceeded in group III (18.6%) 
and group II (14.0%) vs group I (8.0%; P = .044; 1 - β = 57.4%) for diseases 
involving zone 0. Mortality was higher in all subgroups treated for zone 0 
disease compared with corresponding subgroups treated for zone I to zone III 
disease. The incidence of cerebral ischemic events was increased in groups I and 
II vs group III (7.5% and 11% vs 1.7%; P = .0001) and correlated with early 
mortality (R2 = .20; P = .033). The incidence of type II endoleaks and 
endovascular reintervention was similar between groups and correlated with each 
other (R2 = .37; P = .004). Type Ia endoleak occurred more often in groups II 
and III than in group I (7.1% and 12.1% vs 5.8%; P = .023) and correlated with 
midterm mortality (R2 = .53; P = .005). Retrograde type A dissection was low in 
all groups, whereas aneurysm growth was higher in group III (2.6%, 4.2%, 10.7%; 
P = .002), correlating with midterm mortality (R2 = .311; P = .009). Surgical 
revision slightly correlated with surgical complications (R2 = .18; P = .044) 
but not with mortality (R2 = .10; P = .214).
CONCLUSIONS: Because early mortality was significantly higher in patients 
receiving endovascular treatment for proximal aortic disease, endovascular-based 
approaches proved to be feasible alternatives to hybrid surgical procedures, 
especially when they were performed for aneurysms located in the distal aortic 
arch. Whereas cerebral ischemia accompanies both surgical and endovascular 
involvement of the supra-aortic vessels, endoleaks and aneurysm growth remain 
hallmarks of endovascular supra-aortic repair. Because surgical revision had no 
impact on mortality, complete surgical debranching may become the option of 
choice for patients with good life expectancy suffering from proximal aortic 
arch disease, whereas total endovascular procedures could be particularly 
advantageous in patients with short life expectancy and distal aortic arch 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO) has a generally favorable 
prognosis if appropriate treatment is initiated in its early phase; however, 
some intractable cases with HVO can develop neurological impairment as well as 
spinal deformity during the course of treatment and these sequelae may lead to 
impaired quality of life (QOL). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
long-term relapse rate, mortality, and QOL of patients with HVO.
METHODS: In this retrospective case series study, medical records of 60 patients 
with HVO with a mean follow-up period of 8 years (5-23 years) were reviewed to 
assess demographic data, details of infection, and clinical course. Mortality 
rate was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier plot. QOL was measured using the EuroQol 
5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire and residual pain using a numeric rating scale 
(NRS).
RESULTS: HVO relapsed in 4 of 60 patients (7%). Overall 5-year survival rate in 
60 patients with HVO was 85%. The factors associated with increased mortality 
were malignant tumor, diabetes mellitus, chronic use of glucocorticoids, and 
drug-resistant strains of staphylococcus. Female-to-male ratio, NRS, prevalence 
of neurological impairment were significantly higher in patients with low EQ-5D 
score (poor health) compared to those with high EQ-5D score (good health).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HVO have shorter life expectancy if they have 
malignancy, diabetes mellitus, chronic use of glucocorticoids, and a history of 
drug-resistant strains of staphylococcus infection. Female gender, residual 
neurological defects and persistent back pain are associated with impaired QOL 
in patients with HVO.

OBJECTIVE: There is growing international interest in advancing 'the tobacco 
endgame'. We use New Zealand (Smokefree goal for 2025) as a case study to model 
the impacts on smoking prevalence (SP), health gains (quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs)) and cost savings of (1) 10% annual tobacco tax increases, 
(2) a tobacco-free generation (TFG), (3) a substantial outlet reduction 
strategy, (4) a sinking lid on tobacco supply and (5) a combination of 1, 2 and 
3.
METHODS: Two models were used: (1) a dynamic population forecasting model for SP 
and (2) a closed cohort (population alive in 2011) multistate life table model 
(including 16 tobacco-related diseases) for health gains and costs.
RESULTS: All selected tobacco endgame strategies were associated with reductions 
in SP by 2025, down from 34.7%/14.1% for Māori (indigenous population)/non-Māori 
in 2011 to 16.0%/6.8% for tax increases; 11.2%/5.6% for the TFG; 17.8%/7.3% for 
the outlet reduction; 0% for the sinking lid; and 9.3%/4.8% for the combined 
strategy. Major health gains accrued over the remainder of the 2011 population's 
lives ranging from 28 900 QALYs (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI)): 16 500 to 48 
200; outlet reduction) to 282 000 QALYs (95%UI: 189 000 to 405 000; sinking lid) 
compared with business-as-usual (3% discounting). The timing of health gain and 
cost savings greatly differed for the various strategies (with accumulated 
health gain peaking in 2040 for the sinking lid and 2070 for the TFG).
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing endgame strategies is needed to achieve tobacco 
endgame targets and reduce inequalities in smoking. Given such strategies are 
new, modelling studies provide provisional information on what approaches may be 
best.

Objective: To analyze the burden and changes caused by burns among Chinese 
population, from 1990 to 2013. Methods: Using the G20 data and the China 
national and subnational data from GBD2013, this study deemed to comprehensively 
show the burden caused by burns and the change from 1990 to 2013, using the 
indicators of death and DALY. Results: In 2013, the standardized mortality of 
burns in Chinese was 0.88/100 000, with the standardized DALY rate of burn as 
30.58/100 000. The ratio of DALY between males and females was 1.85 ∶ 1. Among 
the G20 countries, China ranked 16 for the standardized DALY rate, according to 
the top down order. The highest death rate was seen in the age group of 70 and 
over, followed by age group of 5, which had the highest DALY rate and followed 
by the 70 or older age group. In different provinces, Guizhou presented the 
highest DALY rate (50.24/100 000), with Aomen area the lowest (6.16/100 000). 
From 1990 to 2013, the burden of burn reduced generally. Both the standardized 
rates on death and DALY reduced by 68.10% and 76.95% respectively, more in 
females than in males. Standardized rates on death and DALY reduced among all 
the age groups, with the rates of reduction increasing by age. From 1990 to 
2013, the DALY rate decreased in all the provinces. Conclusions: The burden of 
burn decreased in Chinese population during 1990-2013. However, the burden of 
burn among children, elderly and males were still relatively high that called 
for closer attention.

Objective: To evaluate the impact of diabetes prevalence and mortality on health 
life expectancy (HLE). Methods: A cause-excluded health adjusted life expectancy 
method was used to quantitatively analyze the impact of diabetes on HLE and the 
composition of health life losses (HLL), using the integrated data on population 
mortality, self-assessed health status and diabetes prevalence. Results: The HLE 
for people aged 15 was 55.80 in Zhejiang, in 2013. After removing the diabetes 
morbidity and mortality, the HLE for men aged 15 increased by 0.86 and 1.13, 
respectively, with an increase of 1.04 and 0.66 for urban and rural residents. 
Substantial increase of HLE was observed in women and urban residents than those 
for men and rural residents. HLL caused by diabetes mortality and morbidity 
appeared as 0.10 and 0.79, with a ratio of 7.92. Conclusion: HLL caused by 
diabetes mortality was much greater than those caused by diabetes mortality, 
suggesting the most effective measure in reducing the diabetes-related HLL is to 
promote the healthy lifestyle in urban areas and especially for women.

OBJECTIVES: Quality-adjusted life-years are the common outcome measure in 
contemporary economic evaluations in health care. Due to the limitations of the 
sensitivity of the EQ-5D-3L in specific disease conditions, the EuroQoL group 
has developed a new EQ-5D-5L classification system with 3,125 health states. 
This study estimated the Sri Lankan value set for the EQ-5D-5L using a crosswalk 
methodology.
METHODS: The EuroQoL group had developed a crosswalk methods to obtain interim 
value set for the EQ-5D-5L health states using available EQ-5D-3L values. This 
was achieved by mapping EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L ratings through cross tabulations 
by each dimension level. Using above official EuroQoL crosswalk probabilities, 
an interim value set for the Sri Lankan EQ-5D-5L health states were generated 
based upon the Sri Lankan EQ-5D-3L value set (which was estimated using time 
trade-off method: n= 780). Comparison were conducted between the Sri Lankan 
EQ-5D-5L values and other countries.
RESULTS: The Sri Lankan EQ-5D-5L recorded utility value of -0.73 for the worst 
health state and 0.85 for a best possible utility for a health state other than 
the full health. The UK (mean= 0.4) and Japanese (mean = 0.45) EQ-5D-5L mean 
utility values were higher than the Sri Lankan values (mean = 0.07). However, 
Thailand median values (0.21) were closer to the Sri Lankan median values (0.14) 
than the UK (0.41) or Japan (0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: This study produced the Sri Lankan EQ-5D-5L interim value set using 
crosswalk methods. Currently, this is the only EQ-5D-5L value set available for 
the South Asian region.

BACKGROUND: Novel anticoagulants, such as factor Xa inhibitors, have entered 
clinical practice as alternatives to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolic event (SEE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). It is 
not known whether edoxaban, the fourth-to-market factor Xa inhibitor approved 
for this indication, will be cost-effective in Taiwan, where the cost of 
warfarin monitoring is prohibitive.
METHODS: A Markov model projecting lifetime results of edoxaban 60 mg/30 mg 
dose-reduced versus warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF, based on the 
ENGAGE AF - TIMI 48 trial, found edoxaban to be of high value relative to 
warfarin, from the perspective of the US health care system. We applied 
Taiwan-specific cost inputs to this model structure to assess the relative 
cost-effectiveness of edoxaban versus warfarin from the perspective of the 
Taiwanese health care system. Event rates and hazard ratios from the ENGAGE AF - 
TIMI 48 East Asian subpopulation were explored in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Edoxaban was found to be highly cost-effective compared with warfarin, 
based on guidelines proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a base 
case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $12,902 per quality-adjusted life 
year gained. These results were robust to variation of key model parameters, 
including assumptions regarding the cost and quality-of-life impact of stroke 
and bleeding events, and assuming East Asian-specific (as opposed to 
full-trial-population) rates for combinations of ischemic stroke, SEE, and major 
bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its higher acquisition cost, edoxaban is an economically 
attractive alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and SEE in 
patients with AF in Taiwan.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate two of the various treatment strategies of bone 
metastasis- single-fraction radiotherapy and multiple-fraction radiotherapy.
METHODS: A multistage Markov decision model was applied to assess the 
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of single 
fraction against multiple fractions. The model had a monthly cycle length over a 
lifetime horizon with 1000 hypothetical cohort samples. The EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire was used to estimate the health-related quality 
of life in patients. To cope with parameters of uncertainty, we conducted a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. 
Both cost and utility variables were discounted by 3% in the base model. 
Strategies were assessed considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $6578 
per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The expected mean cost and quality-adjusted life-years were, 
respectively, US $447.28 and 5.95 months for patients receiving single-fraction 
radiotherapy and US $1269.66 and 7.87 months for those receiving 
multiple-fraction radiotherapy. The incremental cost-utility ratio was US 
$428.38 per QALY. Considering the Iranian gross domestic product per capita (US 
$6578) as the recommended willingness to pay for 1 QALY gained, the 
multiple-fraction method was found to be a cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers should advocate the multiple-fraction method instead 
of the single-fraction method in the treatment of patients with painful bone 
metastases.

OBJECTIVES: The quality safety supervision and test of agricultural products 
urgently need a very excellent analytical method with simultaneously detecting 
many components in order to assess, prevent and control pesticide residues.
METHODS: In this research, three fruits and three vegetables produced in 
Shanghai were selected as the materials, 54 pesticide residues were detected 
with the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric 
(UPLC-MS/MS) method on the basis of optimized QuEChERS method according to 
different materials properties.
RESULTS: The results showed that: all samples were directly extracted by 
acetonitrile containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid; complex matrix samples were 
purified by a mixed sorbent of 300mg MgSO4+100mg PSA+100mg C18+0.01g Carb, 
general matrix samples didn't add Carb, simple matrix samples such as watermelon 
directly filmed; Chromatographic column was ZORBAX Eclipse Plus-C18 column 
(3.0mm×150mm, 3.5μm) at 40°C, the methanol-water of mobile phase at a flow rate 
of 0.45mL/min by a gradient elution contained 0.1% formic acid and 5mmol/L 
ammonium acetate and the injection volume was 1μL. With switching electrospray 
ion source polarity, [M-H]- and high sensitive [M+Na]＋were respectively the 
precursor ions of eight pesticides and avermectin, [M+H]＋ was those of the else 
45 pesticides. The detection parameters of multi-reactions monitoring (MRM) with 
simultaneously positive and negative ions (electron multiplier voltage was 200V) 
scanning were set as follows: the 310.3kPa of nebulizer pressure, the 300°C of 
drying gas temperature, the 7L/min of drying gas flow, the 3000V and 3500V of 
respectively capillary positive and negative voltage. With the optimized method, 
the calibration curves of 54 pesticides were better linear in 15-500μg/kg 
(r ≥0.988), the average adding standard recovery rates of 54 pesticides were 
73.2%-134.3% except pymetrozine and cyromazine with the relative standard 
deviations (RSD) of 1.0%-13.8%; the limit of detection (LOD) under three times 
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and limit of quantitative (LOQ) under 10 times S/N 
were respectively confirmed 0.003-2.000μg/kg and 0.01-6.67μg/kg.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the optimized "QuEChERS-UPLC-MS/MS 
method" was a simple, rapid, sensitive, accurate, efficient, economical and safe 
method that simultaneously detected multiple pesticide residues through one time 
sample treatment; It had some advantages such as more pesticides per detection, 
simple and convenient pretreatment and less solvent dosage to be suitable for 
the quick high-throughput quantitative screening and confirmation of pesticide 
residues in fruits and vegetables.

Medicine, Japan.

Locomotive syndrome is defined as a condition of reduced mobility due to 
impairment of the locomotive organs. With the increased aging of society, the 
demand for the prevention and treatment of locomotive syndrome to improve 
healthy life expectancy is increasing. Studies have shown that exercise programs 
including balance training and resistance training are effective in preventing 
falls. Resistance training also improves walking ability(gait speed)in older 
adults. In Japan, 'locomotion training' consisting of one-leg standing and 
squatting exercise is recommended to prevent locomotive syndrome. Surgical 
intervention for the spine and lower extremities is also indicated if 
conservative management proves ineffective in subjects with progressive walking 
disability.

Food Products Purchased at Spanish Supermarkets.

Mycobacteria include obligate and opportunistic pathogens that cause significant 
human and animal disease. The burden of tuberculosis has been largely reduced in 
developed territories but remains a huge problem worldwide. The significance of 
nontuberculous mycobacteria is growing considerably, especially in developed 
regions with higher life expectancy and more therapy-related immunosuppressed 
individuals. Due to their robustness mycobacteria can contaminate animal 
products by direct transmission from infected individuals or by environmental 
contamination during processing. The situation at market level is poorly known. 
Most studies analyzing commercially available foods are limited to a small or 
local scale and mainly focused on a particular mycobacterial species. There is a 
need to investigate if animal products that have passed the established controls 
to be for sale at main supermarkets could represent a route of contact with any 
mycobacteria. Thus, our goal was to study the prevalence of mycobacteria in 
these foods to assess if this could represent a source of human exposure. Five 
stores from the main supermarket chains in Spain were selected. 138 dairy and 
119 meat products were purchased. All were processed using culture and multiplex 
real-time PCR methods. Additional molecular methods were used to specifically 
identify any positive result. Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (2), M. 
avium subsp. avium (1), and M. fortuitum (1) were isolated from powdered infant 
formula and ground beef, chicken sausage, and mortadella cold cut, respectively. 
Mycobacterial DNA (M. avium, M. tuberculosis complex and other nontuberculous 
mycobacteria) was detected in 15% of dairy products and 2% of meat products. 
These results show that the prevalence of viable mycobacteria in foods of animal 
origin obtained at the supermarket was not substantial although a considerable 
proportion of them contained mycobacterial DNA. Contact with mycobacteria 
through this route could be ensured over time. Further investigation is 
necessary to determine the real impact of foodborne mycobacterial exposure on 
human health and identify critical points in the food production system to 
enable setting up more stringent control measures.

Outcome Prediction for Patient with High-Grade Gliomas from Brain Functional and 
Structural Networks.

High-grade glioma (HGG) is a lethal cancer, which is characterized by very poor 
prognosis. To help optimize treatment strategy, accurate preoperative prediction 
of HGG patient's outcome (i.e., survival time) is of great clinical value. 
However, there are huge individual variability of HGG, which produces a large 
variation in survival time, thus making prognostic prediction more challenging. 
Previous brain imaging-based outcome prediction studies relied only on the 
imaging intensity inside or slightly around the tumor, while ignoring any 
information that is located far away from the lesion (i.e., the "normal 
appearing" brain tissue). Notably, in addition to altering MR image intensity, 
we hypothesize that the HGG growth and its mass effect also change both 
structural (can be modeled by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)) and functional 
brain connectivities (estimated by functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(rs-fMRI)). Therefore, integrating connectomics information in outcome 
prediction could improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we unprecedentedly 
devise a machine learning-based HGG prediction framework that can effectively 
extract valuable features from complex human brain connectome using network 
analysis tools, followed by a novel multi-stage feature selection strategy to 
single out good features while reducing feature redundancy. Ultimately, we use 
support vector machine (SVM) to classify HGG outcome as either bad (survival 
time ≤ 650 days) or good (survival time >650 days). Our method achieved 75 % 
prediction accuracy. We also found that functional and structural networks 
provide complementary information for the outcome prediction, thus leading to 
increased prediction accuracy compared with the baseline method, which only uses 
the basic clinical information (63.2 %).

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
insulin degludec versus insulin glargine, from the Spanish NHS in three groups 
of patients.
METHODS: A short-term cost utility model was developed to estimate effectiveness 
results in terms of the total number of hypoglycaemic events and their 
disutility impact throughout the year on the initial level of quality of life 
for patients in each treatment.
RESULTS: Degludec was the dominant strategy for T2DM BOT and exhibited an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 52.70€/QALY and 11,240.88€/QALY for T1DM 
B/B and T2DM B/B, respectively. Lower costs are primarily driven by lower 
nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemic events, which were reduced versus IGlar. 
Improvements in clinical outcomes in all three patient groups are result of the 
reduced number of hypoglycaemic events showing 0.0211, 0.0328 and 0.0248 QALYs 
gained when compared to IGlar for T1DM B/B, T2DM BOT and T2DM B/B, respectively. 
Different scenario analyses showed that the ICERS were stable to plausible 
variations in the analysed parameters, except when the same number of SMBG for 
both treatments is used, with T2DM B/B showing an ICER over the accepted 
threshold.
CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates that degludec is a cost-effective option 
in the Spanish NHS, when used in patients currently treated with long-acting 
insulin.

AIMS: An economic evidence is a vital tool that can inform the decision to use 
costly insulin analogs. This study aimed to evaluate long-term 
cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir (IDet) compared with insulin glargine 
(IGlar) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from the Thai payer's perspective.
METHODS: Long-term costs and outcomes were projected using a validated IMS CORE 
Diabetes Model, version 8.5. Cohort characteristics, baseline risk factors, and 
costs of diabetes complications were derived from Thai data sources. Relative 
risk was derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis study. Costs and 
outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was presented in 2015 US Dollars (USD). A series of one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: IDet yielded slightly greater quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
(8.921 vs 8.908), but incurred higher costs than IGlar (90,417.63 USD vs 
66,674.03 USD), resulting in an ICER of ∼1.7 million USD per QALY. The findings 
were very sensitive to the cost of IDet. With a 34% reduction in the IDet cost, 
treatment with IDet would become cost-effective according to the Thai threshold 
of 4,434.59 USD per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IDet in patients with T2DM who had uncontrolled 
blood glucose with oral anti-diabetic agents was not a cost-effective strategy 
compared with IGlar treatment in the Thai context. These findings could be 
generalized to other countries with a similar socioeconomics level and 
healthcare systems.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer patients have increased stroke risk from direct and 
indirect malignancy effects. Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue 
plasminogen activator (rtPA) is standard medical treatment for acute ischemic 
stroke (AIS).
AIM: To review rtPA use in AIS patients with active cancer.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational case-control study evaluating 
patients with AIS and cancer admitted to our stroke unit between January/2010 
and June/2015.
RESULTS: Seven cases were identified (86% male; median age: 76), and 20 controls 
were included matched for age and Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project 
classification. 29% experienced direct procedure complications vs 30% within the 
control group, 14% suffered haemorrhagic transformation (vs 20%), one patient 
experienced serious systemic haemorrhage (case) and one patient experienced 
serious intracerebral haemorrhage (control). After three months' follow-up, 43% 
were independent compared with 25% controls, and 29% had died (vs 30%). 
Undetermined aetiology subtype (TOAST classification) was more frequent in 
cancer patients when compared to controls (71% vs 20%).
CONCLUSION: Severe haemorrhagic complications, potentiated by rtPA, carry
