This is the first quantitative analysis of data from urine drug tests for 
compliance to treatment medications and abstinence from drug abuse across 
"levels of care" in six eastern states of America. Comprehensive Analysis of 
Reported Drugs (CARD) data was used in this post-hoc retrospective observational 
study from 10,570 patients, filtered to include a total of 2,919 patients 
prescribed at least one treatment medication during 2010 and 2011. The first and 
last urine samples (5,838 specimens) were analyzed; compliance to treatment 
medications and abstinence from drugs of abuse supported treatment effectiveness 
for many. Compared to non-compliant patients, compliant patients were marginally 
less likely to abuse opioids, cannabinoids, and ethanol during treatment 
although more likely to abuse benzodiazepines. Almost 17% of the non-abstinent 
patients used benzodiazepines, 15% used opiates, and 10% used cocaine during 
treatment. Compliance was significantly higher in residential than in the 
non-residential treatment facilities. Independent of level of care, 67.2% of the 
patients (n = 1963; P<.001) had every treatment medication found in both first 
and last urine specimens (compliance). In addition, 39.2% of the patients 
(n = 1143; P<.001) had no substance of abuse detected in either the first or 
last urine samples (abstinence). Moreover, in 2010, 16.9% of the patients 
(n = 57) were abstinent at first but not at last urine (deteriorating 
abstinence), the percentage dropped to 13.3% (n = 174) in 2011; this improvement 
over years was statistically significant. A longitudinal analysis for abstinence 
and compliance was studied in a randomized subset from 2011, (n = 511) 
representing 17.5% of the total cohort. A statistically significant upward trend 
(p = 2.353×10-8) of abstinence rates as well as a similar but stronger trend for 
compliance ((p = 2.200×10-16) was found. Being cognizant of the trend toward 
drug urine testing being linked to medical necessity eliminating abusive 
screening, the interpretation of these valuable results require further 
intensive investigation.

'Banking time': egg freezing and the negotiation of future fertility.

Sydney , Australia.

This paper examines the relatively recent practice of non-medical egg freezing, 
in which women bank their eggs for later use in conceiving a child. Non-medical 
egg freezing has only been available for about the last five years, as new 
vitrification techniques have made the success rates for actual conception more 
reliable than the earlier method of slow freezing. I draw on interviews with 
both clinicians and women who have banked their eggs to consider how this novel 
practice articulates with broader issues about the relationship between 
sexuality, reproduction and the political economy of household formation. 
Non-medical egg-freezing provides a technical solution to a number of different 
problems women face with regard to the elongation of the life course, the 
extension of education, the cost of household establishment and the iterative 
nature of relationship formation, thematised by the ubiquity of internet dating 
among the interviewees. I focus on the ways women used egg freezing to manage 
and reconcile different forms of time.

study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a common complication in patients at the palliative 
stage of cancer. During the curative phase of cancer, optimal enteral or 
parenteral nutrition intake can reduce morbidity and mortality, and improve 
quality of life. When the main goal of treatment becomes palliative, 
introduction of artificial nutrition is controversial. Although scientific 
societies do not recommend the introduction of artificial nutrition in all cases 
of malnutrition, especially in hypophagic patients if their life expectancy is 
shorter than 2 months, considerable differences in the use of parenteral 
nutrition in nonsurgical oncology practice are noted around the world. One 
explanation is a paucity of well-conducted randomized controlled trials in these 
situations, and consequently, the risk/benefit ratio of parenteral nutrition and 
its impact on quality of life in palliative care remains uncertain.
METHODS/DESIGN: The ALIM-K study is a French national multicenter randomized 
controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of parenteral nutrition, 
versus an exclusive oral-feeding supply, on the quality of life of malnourished 
patients who have a functional digestive tube and who are at the palliative 
phase of advanced cancer with a life expectancy of more than 2 months.
DISCUSSION: This article presents the methodologic options chosen for our study, 
and in particular, the choice of the Zelen method of randomization, the 
definition of the main end point (quality of life), the choice of comparator 
(oral feeding), and the inclusion criteria (life expectancy of more than 2 
months), which are all critical points in building a randomized controlled trial 
in the setting of palliative care.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with the clinical trials database 
ClinicalTrials.gov on May 27, 2014, under the number NCT02151214.

Acromegaly is due to excessive production of growth hormone (GH), generally by a 
pituitary GH-secreting adenoma. Its prevalence is estimated at 40-130 cases per 
million inhabitants. Acromegaly is characterized by slowly progressive acquired 
somatic disfigurement (mainly involving the face and extremities) and systemic 
manifestations. The rheumatologic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic 
consequences of acromegaly determine the prognosis. The diagnosis is confirmed 
by elevated serum GH concentrations that cannot be suppressed by an oral glucose 
load, and by increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Treatment 
is aimed at correcting (or preventing) tumor compression of surrounding tissues 
by excising the disease-causing lesion, and at reducing GH and IGF-1 levels to 
normal values. When surgery (the usual first-line treatment) fails to correct 
GH/IGF-1 hypersecretion, medical treatment with dopamine agonists (particularly 
cabergoline), somatostatin analogs, and/or radiotherapy can be used. The GH 
receptor antagonist pegvisomant is helpful in patients who are resistant to 
somatostatin analogs. Thanks to this multistep therapeutic strategy, adequate 
hormonal disease control is achieved in most patients, giving them a normal life 
expectancy. Comorbidities associated with acromegaly generally improve after 
treatment, but persistent sequelae may nonetheless impair quality of life.

Alternative causes of hypopituitarism: traumatic brain injury, cranial 
irradiation, and infections.

Hypopituitarism often remains unrecognized due to subtle clinical 
manifestations. Anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies may present as isolated 
or multiple and may be transient or permanent. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is 
recognized as a risk factor for hypopituitarism, most frequently presenting with 
isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Data analysis shows that about 15% of 
patients with TBI have some degree of hypopituitarism which if not recognized 
may be mistakenly ascribed to persistent neurologic injury and cognitive 
impairment. Identification of predictors for hypopituitarism after TBI is 
important, one of them being the severity of TBI. The mechanisms involve lesions 
in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and inflammatory changes in the central 
nervous system (CNS). With time, hypopituitarism after TBI may progress or 
reverse. Cranial irradiation is another important risk factor for 
hypopituitarism. Deficiencies in anterior pituitary hormone secretion (partial 
or complete) occur following radiation damage to the hypothalamic-pituitary 
region, the severity and frequency of which correlate with the total radiation 
dose delivered to the region and the length of follow-up. These 
radiation-induced hormone deficiencies are irreversible and progressive. Despite 
numerous case reports, the incidence of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction 
following infectious diseases of the CNS has been underestimated. 
Hypopituitarism usually relates to the severity of the disease, type of 
causative agent (bacterial, TBC, fungal, or viral) and primary localization of 
the infection. Unrecognized hypopituitarism may be misdiagnosed as 
postencephalitic syndrome, while the presence of a sellar mass with suprasellar 
extension may be misdiagnosed as pituitary macroadenoma in a patient with 
pituitary abscess which is potentially a life-threatening disease.

With the aging of our population, the prevalence of prostate cancer is 
anticipated to rise dramatically. Consequently, physicians will be confronted 
with the challenges of managing prostate cancer and treatment side effects in 
older men. The maintenance of mobility and functional independence, which are 
fundamental goals of the aging patient with cancer, should not be overlooked 
when choosing treatments and their toxicities focused on cancer control. 
Consistent with the SIOG (International Society of Geriatric Oncology) 
guidelines, we recommend standard approaches for older patients with prostate 
cancer who are fit. Vulnerable patients should also receive standard treatment, 
provided their health status can be maintained with appropriate interventions. 
Treatment for frail patients should be adapted to their health status and 
supportive care interventions should be considered. Individualized treatment 
plans should take into account patient's remaining life-expectancy from 
coexisting comorbidities and disability, aggressiveness of the prostate cancer, 
treatment preferences as well as potential adverse effects of treatment.

[Investigation of the use of triclosan in patients with indwelling catheters: a 
randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study].

BACKGROUND: This article presents the first randomized, double blind, 
multicenter, placebo-controlled, non-interventional trial with a medical product 
after approval by the ethical committee of the medical council of North-Rhine. 
The study investigated the use of the antimicrobial agent triclosan (Farco-fill® 
Protect) as a liquid for inflation of catheter balloons in patients with chronic 
indwelling catheters.
PATIENTS AND OBJECTIVES: In this study 84 patients were investigated (43 in the 
treatment group and 41 in the placebo group) all with a suprapubic catheter and 
a positive history of catheter incrustation. The catheters were changed after 6 
weeks and endpoints were the quantitative analysis of the incrustation, weight 
of the catheter, pain during catheter change and the number of urinary tract 
infections. The maintenance of the catheter was a secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: The primary endpoint could not be reached because the study, which was 
initially planned with 70 patients in each arm, had to be terminated due to 
logistical and technical problems with the catheter weighing. The maintenance of 
the catheter as the most important clinical parameter showed statistically 
significant differences with a longer indwelling time in the triclosan group. 
Adverse events with respect to the product were not recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the antimicrobial solution triclosan as a fluid for inflation 
of catheter balloons led to a statistically significant extension in the 
catheter indwelling time. The reduction of pain during changing the catheter and 
the reduction of incrustation, although not statistically significant, led to an 
improvement in the quality of life of these patients.

Down syndrome and dementia: Is depression a confounder for accurate diagnosis

The past century has seen a dramatic improvement in the life expectancy of 
people with Down syndrome. However, research has shown that individuals with 
Down syndrome now have an increased likelihood of early onset dementia. They are 
more likely than their mainstream peers to experience other significant 
co-morbidities including mental health issues such as depression. This case 
study reports a phenomenon in which three individuals with Down syndrome and 
dementia are described as experiencing a rebound in their functioning after a 
clear and sustained period of decline. It is hypothesized that this phenomenon 
is not actually a reversal of the expected dementia trajectory but is an 
undiagnosed depression exaggerating the true level of functional decline 
associated with the dementia. The proactive identification and treatment of 
depressive symptoms may therefore increase the quality of life of some people 
with Down syndrome and dementia.

With increases in life expectancy, the focus has shifted to living a healthier, 
longer life. By concentrating on preventing diseases before occurrence, 
researchers aim to diminish the increasing gap in medical costs and health 
inequalities prevalent across many nations. Although we have entered an era of 
post-genomics, we are still in infancy in terms of personalized preventive 
research. Personalized preventive research has and will continue to improve with 
advancements in the use of biomarkers and risk assessment. More evidence based 
on well-designed epidemiologic studies is required to provide comprehensive 
preventive medical care based on genetic and non-genetic profile data. The 
realization of personalized preventive research requires building of evidence 
through appropriate methodology, verification of results through translational 
studies as well as development and application of prediction models.

After ischemic injury, the endogenous repair mechanisms of the human heart are 
insufficient for meaningful tissue regeneration, so muscle lost is replaced by 
noncontractile scar tissue. Current treatments for ischemic cardiomyopathy 
improve quality of life and increase life expectancy, but cannot cure the 
underlying disease of cardiomyocyte loss. Cellular transplantation is emerging 
as a valuable therapeutic approach to heal the ischemic heart. Adult bone marrow 
stem cells are capable of differentiation, regeneration of infarcted myocardium, 
and induction of myogenesis and angiogenesis, ultimately leading to improved 
contractility. Positive results from animal studies have prompted several 
clinical trials to ascertain the safety and feasibility of cell therapy. 
However, despite all the excitement in stem cell research resulting from initial 
experimental data and preliminary clinical trials, the mixed results observed 
have raised many unanswered questions. A major obstacle to the identification of 
the optimal cell therapy is that the fate of the implanted cells and the nature 
of their beneficial effects are ill-defined. A better understanding is 
fundamental for the development of new therapeutic agents, and to optimize stem 
cell applications. Well-designed and powered double-blinded randomized studies 
are clearly needed to confirm promising findings from early studies. With 
several ongoing randomized trials directed toward evaluation of stem cell 
therapies in patients with acute or chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy, the 
Canadian initiative represents a milestone.

Pan computed tomography versus selective computed tomography in stable, young 
adults after blunt trauma with moderate mechanism: a cost-utility analysis.

Bay Oakland, California.

BACKGROUND: Pan computed tomography (PCT) of the head, cervical spine, chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis is a valuable approach for rapid evaluation of severely 
injured blunt trauma patients. A PCT strategy has also been applied for the 
evaluation of patients with lower injury severity; however, the cost-utility of 
this approach is undetermined. The advantage of rapidly identifying all injuries 
via PCT must be weighed against the risk of radiation-induced cancer (RIC). Our 
objective was to compare the cost-utility of PCT with selective computed 
tomography (SCT) in the management of blunt trauma patients with low injury 
severity.
METHODS: A Markov model-based, cost-utility analysis of a hypothetical cohort of 
hemodynamically stable, 30-year-old males evaluated in a trauma center after 
motor vehicle crash was used. CT scans are performed based on the mechanism of 
injury. The analysis compared PCT with SCT over a 1-year time frame with an 
analytic horizon over the lifespan of the patients. The possible outcomes, 
utilities of health states, and health care costs including RIC were derived 
from the published medical literature and public data. Costs were measured in US 
2010 dollars, and incremental effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) with 3% annual discounted rates. Multiway sensitivity 
analyses were performed on all variables.
RESULTS: The total cost for blunt trauma patients undergoing PCT was $15,682 
versus $17,673 for SCT. There was no difference in QALYs between the two 
populations (26.42 vs. 26.40). However, there was a cost savings of $75 per QALY 
for patients receiving PCT versus SCT ($594 per QALY vs. $669 per QALY).
CONCLUSION: PCT enables surgeons to identify and rule out injuries promptly, 
thereby reducing the need for inpatient observation. The risk of RIC is low 
following a single PCT. This cost-utility analysis finds PCT based on mechanism 
to be a cost-effective use of resources.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and value-based evaluations, level II.

Population aging is an inevitable global demographic process. Most of the 
literature on the consequences of demographic change focuses on the economic and 
societal challenges that we will face as people live longer and have fewer 
children. In this paper, we (a) briefly describe key trends and projections of 
the magnitude and speed of population aging; (b) discuss the economic, social, 
and environmental consequences of population aging; and (c) investigate some of 
the opportunities that aging societies create. We use Germany as a case study. 
However, the general insights that we obtain can be generalized to other 
developed countries. We argue that there may be positive unintended side effects 
of population aging that can be leveraged to address pressing environmental 
problems and issues of gender inequality and intergenerational ties.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent observational studies showed that post-operative 
aspirin use reduces cancer relapse and death in the earliest stages of 
colorectal cancer. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of aspirin as an 
adjuvant therapy in Stage I and II colorectal cancer patients aged 65 years and 
older.
METHODS: Two five-state Markov models were constructed separately for Stage I 
and II colorectal cancer using TreeAge Pro 2014. Two hypothetical cohorts of 
10,000 individuals at a starting age of 65 years and with colorectal cancer in 
remission were put through the models separately. Cost-effectiveness of aspirin 
was evaluated against no treatment (Stage I and II) and capecitabine (Stage II) 
over a 20-year period from the United States societal perspective. Extensive 
one-way sensitivity analyses and multivariable Probabilistic Sensitivity 
Analyses (PSA) were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analyses, aspirin was cheaper and more effective 
compared to other comparators in both stages. Sensitivity analyses showed that 
no treatment and capecitabine (Stage II only) can be cost-effective alternatives 
if the utility of taking aspirin is below 0.909, aspirin's annual fatal adverse 
event probability exceeds 0.57%, aspirin's relative risk of disease progression 
is 0.997 or more, or when capecitabine's relative risk of disease progression is 
less than 0.228. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analyses (PSA) further showed that 
aspirin could be cost-effective 50% to 80% of the time when the 
willingness-to-pay threshold was varied from USD 20,000 to USD 100,000.
CONCLUSION: Even with a modest treatment benefit, aspirin is likely to be 
cost-effective in Stage I and II colorectal cancer, thus suggesting a potential 
unique role in secondary prevention in this group of patients.

The neonatal receptor, FcRn, mediates both serum half-life extension as well as 
active transport of maternal IgG to the fetus during pregnancy. Therefore, 
transport efficiency and half-life go hand-in-hand. However, while the half-life 
of the human IgG2 subclass is comparable to IgG1, the placental transport of 
IgG2 is not, with the neonatal IgG1 levels generally exceeding maternal levels 
at birth, but not for IgG2. We hypothesized that the unique short-hinged 
structure of IgG2, which enables its κ-, but not λ-isotype to form at least 
three different structural isoforms, might be a contributing factor to these 
differences. To investigate whether there was any preference for either light 
chain, we measured placental transport of IgG subclasses as well as κ/λ-light 
chain isotypes of IgG1 and IgG2 in 27 matched mother-child pairs. We also 
studied the half-life of IgG1 and IgG2 light chain isotypes in mice, as well as 
that of synthesized IgG2 structural isotypes κA and κB. In order to investigate 
serum clearance of IgG1 and IgG2 light-chain isotypes in humans, we quantified 
the relative proportions of IgG1 and IgG2 light chains in hypogammaglobulinemia 
patients four weeks after IVIg infusion and compared to the original IVIg 
isotype composition. None of our results indicate any light chain preference in 
either of the FcRn mediated mechanisms; half-life extension or maternal 
transport.

OBJECTIVES: In the first decade of the 21st century, the Mexican life expectancy 
changed from a long trend of increase to stagnation. These changes concur with 
an increase in deaths by homicides that the country experienced in that decade, 
and an obesity epidemic that had developed over the last decades of the 20th 
century. We quantify the impact of causes of death on life expectancy from 2000 
to 2010.
METHODS: Two approaches to analyse causes of death are used: the number of life 
years lost due to each of the causes of death in a given year, and 
cause-decomposition techniques for comparisons of life expectancy from 2000 to 
2010.
RESULTS: The apparent stagnation in life expectancy is the result of an increase 
in deaths by homicides and diabetes mellitus on the one hand, and the positive 
improvements observed in other causes of death on the other. The negative impact 
of homicides is particularly observed for ages 15 and 50, and for that of 
diabetes mellitus at ages above 45 years.
CONCLUSIONS: There is little basis for optimism regarding the future scenarios 
of the health of the Mexican population based on the first decade of the 21st 
century. Male life expectancy would have increased by 2 years if deaths by 
homicides and diabetes mellitus had been avoided.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the influence of medical expenses on life expectancy.
METHODS: The expenses of 1,718 municipalities were divided into total expenses, 
hospitalization expenses and expenses other than hospitalization and dental 
expenses. 1) The correlation of life expectancy with sex was considered. 2) The 
correlation between expenses and life expectancy was considered. 3) The 
correlation of life expectancy or expenses with the numbers of doctors, 
dentists, facilities and beds was considered. 4) Using the Mahalanobis-Taguchi 
method, a unit space was formed by 10 municipalities with a high life 
expectancy, and D(2) was calculated. When D(2) was outside the unit space, the 
expenses were not as much as those of the 10 municipalities with a high life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: 1) Life expectancy showed a positive correlation with gender. 2) Male 
life expectancy showed a negative correlation with total and hospitalization 
expenses, and a positive correlation with dental expenses. A positive 
correlation was found between each of expenses and female life expectancy. Total 
expenses, hospitalization expenses and expenses other than those on 
hospitalization showed a negative correlations with life expectancy in Hokkaido. 
Dental expenses showed a negative correlation with life expectancy in Chubu, 
hospitalization expenses showed a negative correlation with life expectancy in 
Kyushu. Total, hospitalization and dental expenses showed positive correlations 
with life expectancy in Tohoku, and dental expenses showed a positive 
correlation with life expectancy in Kanto and Chubu. 3) Total expenses, 
hospitalization expenses and expenses other than those on hospitalization were 
found to correlate with the number of doctors. Dental expenses were found to 
correlate with the numbers of doctors, facilities, and beds. 4) The difference 
in among estranged municipalities was considered. Life expectancy was 
significantly short in estranged municipalities, and the total expenses and 
hospitalization expenses were large.
CONCLUSIONS: The relationship of medical expenses with life expectancy became 
clear. It was assumed that medical performance was poor in estranged 
municipalities.

PURPOSE: Androgen deprivation represents the standard treatment for prostate 
cancer with osseous metastases. We explored the role of cytoreductive radical 
prostatectomy in prostate cancer with low volume skeletal metastases in terms of 
a feasibility study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 patients with biopsy proven prostate 
cancer, minimal osseous metastases (3 or fewer hot spots on bone scan), absence 
of visceral or extensive lymph node metastases and prostate specific antigen 
decrease to less than 1.0 ng/ml after neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy 
were included in the feasibility study (group 1). A total of 38 men with 
metastatic prostate cancer who were treated with androgen deprivation therapy 
without local therapy served as the control group (group 2). Surgery related 
complications, time to castration resistance, and symptom-free, cancer specific 
and overall survival were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Mean patient age was 61 (range 42 to 69) and 64 (range 47 to 83) years 
in groups 1 and 2, respectively, with similar patient characteristics in terms 
of initial prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage and 
extent of metastatic disease. Median followup was 34.5 months (range 7 to 75) 
and 47 months (range 28 to 96) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Median time to 
castration resistant prostate cancer was 40 months (range 9 to 65) and 29 months 
(range 16 to 59) in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.04). Patients in group 1 
experienced significantly better clinical progression-free survival (38.6 vs 
26.5 months, p=0.032) and cancer specific survival rates (95.6% vs 84.2%, 
p=0.043), whereas overall survival was similar. Of the men in groups 1 and 2, 
20% and 29%, respectively, underwent palliative surgical procedures for locally 
progressing prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy is feasible in well selected 
men with metastatic prostate cancer who respond well to neoadjuvant androgen 
deprivation therapy. These men have a long life expectancy, and cytoreductive 
radical prostatectomy reduces the risk of locally recurrent prostate cancer and 
local complications. Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy might be a treatment 
option in the multimodality management of prostate cancer with minimal osseous 
metastases.

BACKGROUND: Primary refractory disease is a main challenge in the management of 
non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). This survey was performed to define the rate of 
refractory disease to first-line therapy in B and T-cell NHL subtypes and the 
long-term survival of primary refractory compared to primary responsive 
patients.
METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of 3,106 patients who had undergone 
primary treatment for NHL between 1982 and 2012, at the Hematology Centers of 
Torino and Bergamo, Italy. Primary treatment included CHOP or CHOP-like regimens 
(63.2%), intensive therapy with autograft (16.9%), or other therapies (19.9%). 
Among B-cell NHL, 1,356 (47.8%) received first-line chemotherapy with rituximab. 
Refractory disease was defined as stable/progressive disease, or transient 
response with disease progression within six months.
RESULTS: Overall, 690 (22.2%) patients showed primary refractory disease, with a 
higher incidence amongst T-cell compared to B-cell NHL (41.9% vs. 20.5%, 
respectively, p<0.001). Several other clinico-pathological factors at 
presentation were variably associated with refractory disease, including 
histological aggressive disease, unfavorable clinical presentation, Bone Marrow 
involvement, low lymphocyte/monocyte ration and male gender. Amongst B-cell NHL, 
the addition of rituximab was associated with a marked reduction of refractory 
disease (13.6% vs. 26.7% for non-supplemented chemotherapy, p<0.001). Overall, 
primary responsive patients had a median survival of 19.8 years, compared to 1.3 
yr. for refractory patients. A prolonged survival was consistently observed in 
all primary responsive patients regardless of the histology. The long life 
expectancy of primary responsive patients was documented in both series managed 
before and after 2.000. Response to first line therapy resulted by far the most 
predictive factor for long-term outcome (HR for primary refractory disease: 
16.52, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Chemosensitivity to primary treatment is crucial for the long-term 
survival in NHL. This supports the necessity of studies aimed to early identify 
refractory disease and to develop different treatment strategies for responsive 
and refractory patients.

    Eradication of Yaws: Historical Efforts and Achieving WHO's 2020 Target.

INTRODUCTION: A disabling and disfiguring disease that "begins where the road 
ends", yaws is targeted by WHO for eradication by the year 2020. The global 
campaign is not yet financed. To evaluate yaws eradication within the context of 
the post-2015 development agenda, we perform a somewhat allegorical 
cost-effectiveness analysis of eradication, comparing it to a counterfactual in 
which we simply wait for more roads (the end of poverty).
METHODS: We use evidence from four yaws eradication pilot sites and other mass 
treatment campaigns to set benchmarks for the cost of eradication in 12 known 
endemic countries. We construct a compartmental model of long-term health 
effects to 2050. Conservatively, we attribute zero cost to the counterfactual 
and allow for gradual exit of the susceptible (at risk) population by road 
(poverty reduction). We report mean, 5th and 95th centile estimates to reflect 
uncertainty about costs and effects.
RESULTS: Our benchmark for the economic cost of yaws eradication is uncertain 
but not high -US$ 362 (75-1073) million in 12 countries. Eradication would cost 
US$ 26 (4.2-78) for each year of life lived without disability or disfigurement 
due to yaws, or US$ 324 (47-936) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY). 
Excluding drugs, existing staff and assets, the financial cost benchmark is US$ 
213 (74-522) million. The real cost of waiting for more roads (poverty 
reduction) would be 13 (7.3-20) million years of life affected by early-stage 
yaws and 2.3 (1.1-4.2) million years of life affected by late-stage yaws.
DISCUSSION: Endemic countries need financing to begin implementing and adapting 
global strategy to local conditions. Donations of drugs and diagnostics could 
reduce cost to the public sector and catalyze financing. Resources may be 
harnessed from the extractive industries. Yaws eradication should be seen as 
complementary to universal health coverage and shared prosperity on the 
post-2015 development agenda.
