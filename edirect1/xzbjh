METHODS: This study was a randomized clinical trial study on patients suffering 
from frozen shoulder who were referred to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences 
hospitals in 2011 and 2012. A total of 36 patients were enrolled in the study. 
Eligible patients were allocated into two groups. Intervention group received 
extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) once a week for 4 weeks. The control 
group received sham shockwave therapy once a week for 4 weeks. On the follow-up 
period, changes in individual performance and the amount of pain and disability 
were assessed by the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) questionnaire 
and the range of motion changes were assessed by a goniometer. Data obtained 
were analyzed using SPSS software.
RESULTS: Variance analysis revealed a difference in the mean pain and disability 
score of the SPADI questionnaire, flexion, extension, and abduction, external 
rotation of involved shoulder between two groups before and after the shockwave 
therapy (P < 0.05). Improvement was more satisfactory in the intervention group, 
but the mean internal rotation did not differ significantly in two groups (P > 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of ESWT seems to have positive effects on treatment, 
quicker return to daily activities, and quality-of-life improvement on frozen 
shoulder.

Cost-effectiveness of boceprevir co-administration versus pegylated 
interferon-α2b and ribavirin only for patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 in

BACKGROUND: Patients infected with chronic HCV genotype 1 experience liver 
complications as the disease progresses. This study aims to project the 
long-term reduction of liver complications and cost-effectiveness of treatment 
strategies, including co-administrating boceprevir (BOC) with pegylated 
interferon-α2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin compared with standard of care (SOC) of 
PEG-IFN and ribavirin only.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to estimate the expected costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with treatment strategies 
outlined in the BOC package insert in Singapore. Patient characteristics were 
from pivotal trials, the transition probabilities and QALYs were estimated from 
publications, and the pharmaceutical and health status costs were obtained from 
a public hospital in Singapore. The threshold of cost-effectiveness was chosen 
as 65,000 SGD for this study.
RESULTS: For treatment-naive patients, BOC is highly cost-effective compared 
with SOC (179 SGD/QALY) and cost-saving for patients who have failed prior 
treatment, due to higher QALYs from better sustained virological response (SVR) 
and lower costs from avoidance of complications. Sub-group analyses show that 
BOC is cost-effective for non-cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients and null 
responders. It out-performs SOC for treatment-naive non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic 
patients who have failed prior treatment. Even after adjusting for higher 
prevalence of favourable IL28B genotype in Asians, BOC is cost-effective 
compared with SOC. Only untreated cirrhotic patients showed inconclusive 
cost-effectiveness for BOC.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SOC, BOC prevents more HCV liver complications from 
HCV genotype 1, particularly in patients who have failed previous SOC. Improved 
SVR and shortened duration of treatment result in BOC being potentially 
cost-saving or cost-effective in an Asian population.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to provide an update on various 
relevant endocrine aspects of care in adolescents and adults with cystic 
fibrosis.
RECENT FINDINGS: As life expectancy in cystic fibrosis has continuously 
improved, endocrine complications have become more apparent. The common 
endocrine complications include cystic fibrosis related diabetes, cystic 
fibrosis related bone disease, vitamin D deficiency and poor growth and pubertal 
development. Thyroid and adrenal disorders have also been reported, although the 
prevalence appears to be less common.
SUMMARY: Endocrine diseases are an increasingly recognized complication that has 
a significant impact on the overall health of individuals with cystic fibrosis. 
This review summarizes the updated screening and management of endocrine 
diseases in the cystic fibrosis population.

The dynamics of interconverting D- and E-forms of the HIV-1 integrase N-terminal 
domain.

The N-terminal domain (NTD) of HIV-1 integrase adopts two inter-converting forms 
(D- and E-) due to their specific coordination of a Zn(2+) ion by an HHCC motif. 
Mutational studies on NTD have suggested the importance of conformational 
transition in regulating the functions of tetramers and dimers of HIV-1 
integrase. This study explores the stability and dynamics of native NTD forms 
and the conformational transition between D- and E-forms using molecular 
dynamics simulations elucidating their role in regulation of viral and host DNA 
integration. Simulation of native forms of NTD revealed stable dynamics. 
Transition studies between D- and E-forms using conventional molecular dynamics 
simulations for 50 ns partially revealed conformational change towards the 
target during D- to -E simulation (the extension of α1-helix), which failed in 
the E- to -D simulation. This could be attributed to the existence of the D-form 
(-1,945.907 kCal/mol) in higher energy than the E-form (-2,002.383 kCal/mol). 
The conformational transition pathway between these two states was explored 
using targeted molecular dynamics simulations. Analysis of the targeted 
molecular dynamics trajectories revealed conformations closer to the 
experimentally-reported intermediate form of an NTD during the transition phase. 
The role of Met22 in stabilizing the E-form was studied by simulating the E-form 
with Met22Ala mutation, revealing a highly dynamic α1-helix as compared to the 
native form. The present study reveals the significant role of the Zn(2+) 
ion-coordinated HHCC motif and its interaction with Met22 as the basis for 
understanding the biological implications of D- and E-forms of the NTD in 
regulating integration reaction.

Advances in treatment are contributing to substantial increases in life 
expectancy for individuals living with HIV, prompting a need to develop care 
models for the effective management of HIV as a chronic illness. With many 
individuals continuing to experience symptoms and complications that add to the 
disease burden across the spectrum of HIV disease, the discussion herein 
explores the complementary role that early palliative care can play in HIV 
primary care as a strategy for enhancing long-term quality of life. After first 
defining the concept of early palliative care, its scope in the context of 
current clinical realities in HIV treatment and implications for HIV care models 
is described. After reviewing the emerging extant research literature on HIV 
palliative care outcomes, a program description is offered as an illustration of 
how palliative care integration with HIV primary care can be achieved.

The impact of seasonal effects on the time course of an infectious disease can 
be dramatic. Seasonal fluctuations in the transmission rate for an infectious 
disease are known mathematically to induce cyclical behaviour and drive the 
onset of multistable and chaotic dynamics. These properties of forced dynamical 
systems have previously been used to explain observed changes in the period of 
outbreaks of infections such as measles, varicella (chickenpox), rubella and 
pertussis (whooping cough). Here, we examine in detail the dynamical properties 
of a seasonally forced extension of a model of infection previously used to 
study pertussis. The model is novel in that it includes a non-linear feedback 
term capturing the interaction between exposure and the duration of protection 
against re-infection. We show that the presence of limit cycles and 
multistability in the unforced system give rise to complex and intricate 
behaviour as seasonal forcing is introduced. Through a mixture of numerical 
simulation and bifurcation analysis, we identify and explain the origins of 
chaotic regions of parameter space. Furthermore, we identify regions where 
saddle node lines and period-doubling cascades of different orbital periods 
overlap, suggesting that the system is particularly sensitive to small 
perturbations in its parameters and prone to multistable behaviour. From a 
public health point of view - framed through the 'demographic transition' 
whereby a population׳s birth rate drops over time (and life-expectancy 
commensurately increases) - we argue that even weak levels of seasonal-forcing 
and immune boosting may contribute to the myriad of complex and unexpected 
epidemiological behaviours observed for diseases such as pertussis. Our approach 
helps to contextualise these epidemiological observations and provides guidance 
on how to consider the potential impact of vaccination programs.

OBJECTIVE: There is a worldwide surge in numbers of elderly people requiring 
hemodialysis accompanying the prevailing increase in longevity. There is a trend 
for central venous catheters to be preferentially placed in elderly patients, 
whereas others recommend routine use of grafts for surgical access. In our 
center, age has not been a consideration in deciding to construct arteriovenous 
access for hemodialysis. We reviewed our experience with arteriovenous access 
surgery in all hemodialysis patients aged 80 years and older to determine if 
this approach is justified in terms of patency and life expectancy.
METHODS: A retrospective study was made of all patients aged 80 years and older 
who had surgery from January 2005 to December 2009 at our national vascular 
access referral center. All patients had preoperative mapping and had fistula 
construction if the vein size was at least 3 mm. Otherwise they had 
brachiobasilic or brachioaxillary grafts. All patients had routine access 
surveillance by Doppler ultrasound (duplex) and physical examination at regular 
intervals, and interventions were carried out according to the findings. Type of 
access, success rate, maturation, primary and secondary patency, and patient 
survival in the age group older than 80 years were noted.
RESULTS: During the study period, 134 patients had 146 new accesses. There were 
128 autogenous accesses (30 forearm, 91 upper arm, and seven transposed basilic 
veins) and 18 prosthetic accesses. Overall primary patency was 39%, 33%, and 23% 
at 12, 24, and 36 months. Secondary patency was 92%, 83%, and 77% at 12, 24, and 
36 months. There was no significant difference in patency between the different 
types of accesses and between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Eleven upper 
arm and four forearm fistulas had delayed maturation or nonmaturation. The 
relative risk for delayed maturation or nonmaturation of forearm fistulas 
(13.3%) compared with brachial-cephalic fistula (12.1%) was 1.1030 (95% 
confidence interval, 0.3973-3.204; P = .8571). Median patient survival was 38 
months, with 49 dying during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to recent recommendations favoring grafts for hemodialysis 
in patients older than 80 years, most elderly patients in this study were found 
to have vasculature that was suitable for autogenous access construction, with 
patency rates similar to those of their younger counterparts when adequate 
preoperative planning and postoperative maintenance were carried out. Age alone 
should not disqualify patients older than 80 years from access surgery for 
hemodialysis, nor should age disqualify these patients from the Fistula First 
Initiative.

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are persistent disabling 
neurodevelopmental disorders clinically evident from early childhood. For the 
first time, the burden of ASDs has been estimated for the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010). The aims of this study were to develop global and 
regional prevalence models and estimate the global burden of disease of ASDs.
METHOD: A systematic review was conducted for epidemiological data (prevalence, 
incidence, remission and mortality risk) of autistic disorder and other ASDs. 
Data were pooled using a Bayesian meta-regression approach while adjusting for 
between-study variance to derive prevalence models. Burden was calculated in 
terms of years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), which are reported here by world region for 1990 and 2010.
RESULTS: In 2010 there were an estimated 52 million cases of ASDs, equating to a 
prevalence of 7.6 per 1000 or one in 132 persons. After accounting for 
methodological variations, there was no clear evidence of a change in prevalence 
for autistic disorder or other ASDs between 1990 and 2010. Worldwide, there was 
little regional variation in the prevalence of ASDs. Globally, autistic 
disorders accounted for more than 58 DALYs per 100 000 population and other ASDs 
accounted for 53 DALYs per 100 000.
CONCLUSIONS: ASDs account for substantial health loss across the lifespan. 
Understanding the burden of ASDs is essential for effective policy making. An 
accurate epidemiological description of ASDs is needed to inform public health 
policy and to plan for education, housing and financial support services.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a case management intervention 
by trained nurses in elderly (≥65 years) patients with myocardial infarction 
from a societal perspective.
METHODS: The intervention and observation period spanned 1 year and 329 
participants were enrolled. The intervention consisted of at least one home 
visit and quarterly telephone calls. Data on resource use and quality of life 
were collected quarterly. The primary measurements of effect were 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on the EuroQol five-dimensional 
questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) health utilities from the German time trade-off. The 
secondary measurements were EQ-5D-3L utility values and patients' self-rated 
health states according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) among survivors. To 
estimate mean differences, a linear regression model was used for QALYs and a 
gamma model for costs. Health states among the survivors were analysed using 
linear mixed models. To assess the impact of different health state valuation 
methods, VAS-adjusted life years were constructed.
RESULTS: The mean difference in QALYs was small and not significant (-0.0163; CI 
-0.0681-0.0354, p value: 0.536, n = 297). Among survivors, EQ-5D-3L utilities 
showed significant improvements within 6 months in the intervention group 
(0.051; CI 0.0028-0.0989; p value: 0.0379, n = 280) but returned towards 
baseline levels by month 12. The mean improvement in self-rated health (VAS) 
within 1 year was significantly larger in the intervention group (+9.2, CI 
4.665-13.766, p value: <0.0001, n = 266). The overall cost difference was 
-<euro>17.61 (CI - <euro>2,601-<euro>2,615; p value: 0.9856, n = 297). The 
difference in VAS-adjusted life years was 0.0378 (CI -0.0040-0.0796, p value: 
0.0759, n = 297).
CONCLUSIONS: This study could not provide evidence to conclude that the case 
management intervention was an effective and cost-effective alternative to usual 
care within a time horizon of 1 year.

Effects of living at higher altitudes on mortality: a narrative review.

Burtscher M(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Sport Science, Medical Section, University Innsbruck, Austria ; 
Austrian Society for Alpine and High Altitude Medicine, Innsbruck, Austria.

Beside genetic and life-style characteristics environmental factors may 
profoundly influence mortality and life expectancy. The high altitude climate 
comprises a set of conditions bearing the potential of modifying morbidity and 
mortality of approximately 400 million people who are permanently residing at 
elevations above 1500 meters. However, epidemiological data on the effects of 
high altitude living on mortality from major diseases are inconsistent probably 
due to differences in ethnicity, behavioral factors and the complex interactions 
with environmental conditions. The available data indicate that residency at 
higher altitudes are associated with lower mortality from cardiovascular 
diseases, stroke and certain types of cancer. In contrast mortality from COPD 
and probably also from lower respiratory tract infections is rather elevated. It 
may be argued that moderate altitudes are more protective than high or even very 
high altitudes. Whereas living at higher elevations may frequently protect from 
development of diseases, it could adversely affect mortality when diseases 
progress. Corroborating and expanding these findings would be helpful for 
optimization of medical care and disease management in the aging residents of 
higher altitudes.

In recent decades, the increase in human longevity has made it increasingly 
important to expand our knowledge on aging. To accomplish this, the use of 
animal models is essential, with the most common being mouse (phylogenetically 
similar to humans, and a model with a long life expectancy) and Caenorhabditis 
elegans (an invertebrate with a short life span, but quite removed from us in 
evolutionary terms). However, some sort of model is needed to bridge the 
differences between those mentioned above, achieving a balance between 
phylogenetic distance and life span. Fish of the genus Nothobranchius were 
suggested 10 years ago as a possible alternative for the study of the aging 
process. In the meantime, numerous studies have been conducted at different 
levels: behavioral (including the study of the rest-activity rhythm), 
populational, histochemical, biochemical and genetic, among others, with very 
positive results. This review compiles what we know about Nothobranchius to 
date, and examines its future prospects as a true alternative to the classic 
models for studies on aging.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Polycystic liver disease (PLD), the most common extrarenal 
manifestation of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), has 
become more prevalent as a result of increased life expectancy, improved renal 
survival, reduced cardiovascular mortality, and renal replacement therapy. No 
studies have fully characterized PLD in large cohorts. We investigated whether 
liver and cyst volumes are associated with volume of the hepatic parenchyma, 
results from liver laboratory tests, and patient-reported outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline liver volumes, 
measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and their association with demographics, 
results from liver laboratory and other tests, and quality of life. The data 
were collected from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial underway at 7 
tertiary-care medical centers to determine whether the combination of an 
angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II-receptor blocker 
was superior to the inhibitor alone, and whether low blood pressure (<110/75 mm 
Hg) was superior to standard blood pressure (120-130/70-80 mm Hg), in delaying 
renal cystic progression in 558 patients with ADPKD, stages 1 and 2 chronic 
kidney disease, and hypertension (age, 15-49 y).
RESULTS: We found hepatomegaly to be common among patients with ADPKD. Cysts and 
parenchyma contributed to hepatomegaly. Cysts were more common and liver and 
cyst volumes were greater in women, increasing with age. Patients with advanced 
disease had a relative loss of liver parenchyma. We observed small abnormalities 
in results from liver laboratory tests, and that splenomegaly and hypersplenism 
were associated with PLD severity. Higher liver volumes were associated with a 
lower quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatomegaly is common even in early stage ADPKD and is not 
accounted for by cysts alone. Parenchymal volumes were larger, compared with 
liver volumes of patients without ADPKD or with those predicted by standardized 
equations, even among patients without cysts. The severity of PLD was associated 
with altered biochemical and hematologic features, as well as quality of life.

Although improving health outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected persons has been identified as a national priority, little is 
known about the factors associated with hospitalizations of HIV-infected persons 
in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Since the introduction 
of HAART in 1996, there has been a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of 
HIV-infected persons. However, aging and the long term use of HIV medications 
have led to an increased incidence of chronic, non-HIV-related illnesses. To 
improve patient outcomes, the factors that contribute to co-morbidities in 
HIV-infected persons need to be identified. As a first step, we will summarize 
the current literature on causes and contributing factors of hospitalizations in 
adults infected with HIV in the HAART era.

The total number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is greater for 
women than for men, although the mean age at manifestation of CVD is about 
10 years older. However, the annual number of cases treated for CVD in acute 
hospital settings in men exceeds that of women by 50 %. Remarkable gender 
differences exist in terms of morphological and physiological conditions (e.g. 
mean coronary vessel diameter; ability to adapt to protective exercise-induced 
myocardial hypertrophy), as well as of the frequency and clinical significance 
of somatic risk factors (e.g. smoking). Female body weight increases after 
menopause and the body shape assumes a more android fat distribution. Women 
report higher levels of unspecific and affective symptoms. They suffer more from 
anxiety and depression than men; however, the secondary impact on CVD onset may 
be less pronounced. The post-acute CVD course is more complicated in women, 
mainly because they are older and suffer more from multi-morbidity. Whilst male 
CVD patients aim for a rapid recovery, physical fitness and an increased life 
expectancy, female patients seek relief from everyday challenges, the 
maintenance of their independence and emotional support.

Pirfenidone is an orally administered drug with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory 
and anti-oxidant properties. The efficacy of pirfenidone is supported by a 
number of Phase III trials as well as a Cochrane meta-analysis and tolerability 
data are also provided by clinical trials and a long-term extension phase of 
these studies. These trials led to the approval of pirfenidone for the treatment 
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Japan in 2008 and in Europe in 2011 
and it is now indicated for treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate IPF. The 
primary endpoint of these studies has usually been the change in percentage 
predicted forced vital capacity from baseline; there has been no improvement in 
respiratory symptoms and/or quality of life measurements and/or decrease in 
mortality. Clinical and basic research studies are needed to expand our 
knowledge, understanding the final role of pirfenidone in the treatment of IPF 
and also identifing genetic factors that influence the effectiveness of this 
treatment.

Data on life expectancies and risk of death from cancer are essential 
information to have when making informed decisions about cancer screening and 
treatment options, but has never been presented in a way that is readily 
available to use for physicians in Japan. We provided estimates of life 
expectancies and predicted risk of death from seven most common types of cancer 
(lung, gastric, liver, colon, prostate, breast, and cervical) by quartiles for 
the older Japanese population above 50 years old, using 2010 life tables and 
cancer mortality statistics data. We found that there was a large difference in 
life expectancy between older persons in the upper and lower quartiles. Risk of 
death from breast cancer was low. By using this data, physicians can more 
accurately obtain life expectancy estimates by assessing which quartile the 
patient is most likely to fall under, and help patients make better informed 
decisions.

Peri-urbanisation, counter-urbanisation, and an extension of residential 
exposure to ticks: a clue to the trends in Lyme borreliosis incidence in the 
Czech Republic?

Republic.

The incidence of tick-borne human diseases (TBD) in the Czech Republic (CZ) is 
on the increase, driven by infections increasingly acquired in residential 
locations, earlier in spring and later in autumn, and among children and the 
elderly. To interpret these trends, data on Lyme borreliosis (LB) incidence 
between 1997 and 2010 were analysed in the context of population migration flows 
registered in the CZ during the same period. Analysis showed that a migration 
stream of families with children, and of the elderly, flowed from more urbanized 
and densely populated localities to those more rural and less populated, where 
the chance of acquiring LB in the home vicinity was greater than in the urban 
settings. By contrast, a stream of people in the life phase between early 
adulthood and family formation flowed reversely, corresponding to a prominent 
absence of this age category from the patient spectrum. The data further showed 
that the more the residential exposure became prevalent, the more people were in 
year-round (rather than in summertime only) contact with ticks, which accounts 
for an extension of the cases' seasonal distribution as well as for an overall 
increase in case numbers. Finally, the fact that majority of the urban-to-rural 
migrants could be categorised as wealthier people could explain the previously 
noticed lack of low-status people among TBD patients in the CZ.

People's Republic of China.

As a result of increased life expectancy, octogenarians constitute an increasing 
proportion of patients admitted to hospital for ST-segment elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is currently the 
treatment of choice for octogenarians presenting with STEMI. The recent 
literature on this topic has yielded controversial results, even though advances 
in drug-eluting stents and new types of antithrombotic agents are improving the 
management of STEMI and postoperative care. In this paper, we review the current 
status of percutaneous coronary intervention in the elderly with STEMI, 
including the reasons for their high mortality and morbidity, predictors of 
mortality, and strategies to improve outcomes.

Falls are the leading cause of injuries among older adults, aged 65 years and 
older. Furthermore, falls are an increasing public health problem because of 
ageing populations worldwide due to an increase in the number of older adults, 
and an increase in life expectancy. Numerous studies have identified risk 
factors and investigated possible strategies to prevent (recurrent) falls in 
community-dwelling older people and those living in long-term care facilities. 
Several types of drugs have been associated with an increased fall risk. Since 
drugs are a modifiable risk factor, periodic drug review among older adults 
should be incorporated in a fall prevention programme.

Factors affecting the technical efficiency of health systems: A case study of 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) countries (2004-10).

BACKGROUND: Improving efficiency of health sector is of particular importance in 
all countries. To reach this end, it is paramount to measure the efficiency. On 
the other hand, there are many factors that affect the efficiency of health 
systems. This study aimed to measure the Technical Efficiency (TE) of health 
systems in Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) countries during 2004-10 and 
to determine the factors affecting their TE.
METHODS: This was a descriptive-analytical and panel study. The required data 
were gathered using library and field studies, available statistics and 
international websites through completing data collection forms. In this study, 
the TE of health systems in 10 ECO countries was measured using their available 
data and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) through two approaches. The first 
approach used GDP per capita, education and smoking as its inputs and life 
expectancy and infant mortality rates as the outputs. The second approach, also, 
used the health expenditures per capita, the number of physicians per thousand 
people, and the number of hospital beds per thousand people as its inputs and 
life expectancy and under-5 mortality rates as the outputs. Then, the factors 
affecting the TE of health systems were determined using the panel data logit 
model. Excel 2010, Win4Deap 1.1.2 and Stata 11.0 were used to analyze the 
collected data.
RESULTS: According to the first approach, the mean TE of health systems was 
0.497 and based on the second one it was 0.563. Turkey and Turkmenistan had, 
respectively, the highest and lowest mean of efficiency. Also, the results of 
panel data logit model showed that only GDP per capita and health expenditures 
per capita had significant relationships with the TE of health systems.
CONCLUSION: In order to maximize the TE of health systems, health policy-makers 
should pay special attention to the proper use of healthcare resources according 
to the people's needs, the appropriate management of the health system 
resources, allocating adequate budgets to the health sector, establishing an 
appropriate referral system to provide better public access to health services 
according to their income and needs, among many others.

Croatia: health system review.

Croatia is a small central European country on the Balkan peninsula, with a 
population of approximately 4.3 million and a gross domestic product (GDP) of 
62% of the European Union (EU) average (expressed in purchasing power parity; 
PPP) in 2012. On 1 July 2013, Croatia became the 28th Member State of the EU. 
Life expectancy at birth has been increasing steadily in Croatia (with a small 
decline in the years following the 1991 to 1995 War of Independence) but is 
still lower than the EU average. Prevalence of overweight and obesity in the 
population has increased during recent years and trends in physical inactivity 
are alarming. The Croatian Health Insurance Fund (CHIF), established in 1993, is 
the sole insurer in the mandatory health insurance (MHI) system that provides 
universal health coverage to the whole population. The ownership of secondary 
health care facilities is distributed between the State and the counties. The 
financial position of public hospitals is weak and recent reforms were aimed at 
improving this. The introduction of concessions in 2009 (public private 
partnerships whereby county governments organize tenders for the provision of 
specific primary health care services) allowed the counties to play a more 
active role in the organization, coordination and management of primary health 
care; most primary care practices have been privatized. The proportion of GDP 
spent on health by the Croatian government remains relatively low compared to 
western Europe, as does the per capita health expenditure. Although the share of 
public expenditure as a proportion of total health expenditure (THE) has been 
decreasing, at around 82% it is still relatively high, even by European 
standards. The main source of the CHIFs revenue is compulsory health insurance 
contributions, accounting for 76% of the total revenues of the CHIF, although 
only about a third of the population (active workers) is liable to pay full 
health care contributions. Although the breadth and scope of the MHI scheme are 
broad, patients must pay towards the costs of many goods and services, and the 
right to free health care services has been systematically reduced since 2003, 
although with exemptions for vulnerable population groups. Configuration of 
capital and human resources in the health care sector could be improved: for 
example, homes for the elderly and infirm persons operate close to maximum 
capacity; psychiatric care in the community is not well developed; and there are 
shortages of certain categories of medical professionals, including geographical 
imbalances. Little research is available on the policy process of health care 
reforms in Croatia. However, it seems that reforms often lack strategic 
foundations and or projections that could be analysed and scrutinized by the 
public, and evaluation of reform outcomes is lacking. The overall performance of 
the health care system seems to be good, given the amount of resources 
available. However, there is a lack of data to assess it properly.

Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) continues to cause disability among 
unvaccinated populations in countries with no or insufficient rubella vaccine 
coverage to prevent transmission. We systematically reviewed the literature on 
birth outcomes associated with CRS to estimate the duration, severity, and 
frequency of combinations of morbidities. We searched PubMed, the Science 
Citation Index, and references from relevant articles for studies in English 
with primary data on the frequency of CRS manifestations for ≥20 cases and 
identified 65 studies representing 66 study populations that met our inclusion 
criteria. We abstracted available data on CRS cases with one or more hearing, 
heart, and/or eye defect following maternal rubella infection during the period 
of 0-20 weeks since the last menstrual period. We assessed the quality and 
weight of the available evidence using a modified Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Most of the evidence 
originates from studies in developed countries of cohorts of infants identified 
with CRS in the 1960s and 1970s, prior to the development of standardized 
definitions for CRS and widespread use of vaccine. We developed estimates of 
undiscounted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost per CRS case for 
countries of different income levels. The estimates ranged from approximately 19 
to 39 for high-income countries assuming optimal treatment and from 
approximately 29 to 39 DALYs lost per CRS case in low- and lower- middle-income 
countries assuming minimal treatment, with the lower bound based on 2010 general 
global burden of disease disability weights and the upper bound based on 1990 
age-specific and treatment-specific global burden of disease disability weights. 
Policymakers and analysts should appreciate the significant burden of disability 
caused by CRS as they evaluate opportunities to manage rubella.

OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the impact of avoidable mortality (AM) on the changes in 
life expectancy at birth (LE) in Tuscany Region (Central Italy) in two periods 
(1987-1989 and 2006-2008).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: a list of AM causes previously published was used. The 
AM were divided into two groups: AM by Health Policy Interventions (HPI), AM by 
Health System Interventions (HSI).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: years of potential life lost (PYLLs), rates of PYLL 
standardized on the European population (TSPYLLs), and LE were examined.
RESULTS: in 2006-2008, LE increased with a gain of 5.2 in men and 3.8 in women 
in comparison to 1987-1989 LE (respectively 79 and 84,9 years). If AM did not 
have occurred, LE would have further increased of 2 years in men and 1.5 in 
women. AM recorded a 39% decrease: from 25.3% of overall mortality in men in 
1987-1989 to 16.1% in 2006-2008; in women from 14.3% to 8.4%. Injury/poisoning 
and lung cancer are the most frequent IPP. The only increasing AM is lung cancer 
in women. Disentangling LE increases by group of causes, 25% of the increases in 
2006- 2008, compared to 1987-1989, was attributable to HSI reduction, and 4% in 
women and 16% in men to HPI reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: AM recorded a 39% decrease from 1987-1989 to 2006-2008 in Tuscany. 
In 2006-2008, about one third of LE increase in women and 2/5 in men was 
attributable to AM decrease, while 2/3 in women and 3/5 in men to increased 
survival in eldest people.

Food insecurity is a significant issue in the Victorian Aboriginal population, 
contributing to the health disparity and reduced life expectancy. Community food 
programs are a strategy used to minimise individual level food insecurity, with 
little evidence regarding their effectiveness for Aboriginal populations. The 
aim of this study was to explore the role of community food programs operating 
for Aboriginal people in Victoria and their perceived influence on food access 
and nutrition. Semistructured interviews were conducted with staff (n=23) from a 
purposive sample of 18 community food programs across Victoria. Interviews 
explored the programs' operation, key benefits to the community, challenges and 
recommendations for setting up a successful community food program. Results were 
analysed using a qualitative thematic approach and revealed three main themes 
regarding key factors for the success of community food programs: (1) community 
food programs for Aboriginal people should support access to safe, affordable, 
nutritious food in a socially and culturally acceptable environment; (2) a 
community development approach is essential for program sustainability; and (3) 
there is a need to build the capacity of community food programs as part of a 
strategy to ensure sustainability. Community food programs may be an effective 
initiative for reducing food insecurity in the Victorian Aboriginal population.
