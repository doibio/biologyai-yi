MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model of diagnostic imaging screening 
strategies was built to predict outcomes and cumulative radiation doses for 
children with DICER1 mutations screened for pleuropulmonary blastoma. Screening 
strategies compared were chest radiographs followed by chest CT for a positive 
radiographic result and CT alone. Screening frequencies ranged from once in 3 
years to once every 3 months. BEIR VII (model VII proposed by the Committee on 
the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation) risk tables were used to predict 
excess cancer mortality for each strategy, and the corresponding loss of life 
expectancy was calculated using Surveillance Epidemiologic and End Results 
(SEER) statistics. Loss of life expectancy owing to undetected progressive 
pleuropulmonary blastoma was estimated on the basis of data from the 
International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Registry. Sensitivity analysis was 
performed for all model parameters.
RESULTS: Loss of life expectancy owing to undetected disease in an unscreened 
population exceeded that owing to radiation-induced cancer for all screening 
scenarios investigated. Increases in imaging frequency decreased loss of life 
expectancy for the combined (chest radiographs and CT) screening strategy but 
increased that for the CT-only strategy. This was because loss of life 
expectancy for combined screening is dominated by undetected disease, whereas 
loss of life expectancy for CT screening is dominated by radiation-induced 
cancers.
CONCLUSION: Even for a rare disease such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, 
radiographic screening of infants and young children with cancer-predisposing 
mutations may result in improved life expectancy compared with the unscreened 
population. The benefit of screening will be greater for diseases with a higher 
screening yield.

When a child is born with or acquires special needs, the parents may find some 
parental tasks more difficult. They may not know how to make their tasks easier, 
or that some parents find it exceptionally rewarding and meaningful to raise 
their children with special needs. This piece explores how clinicians might 
share this potentially life-altering information. It also explores when and why 
clinicians might want to make one-of-a-kind exceptions to their usual 
professional practices.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the 
United States. Approximately 3% of colorectal cancers are associated with Lynch 
Syndrome. Controversy exists regarding the optimal screening strategy for Lynch 
Syndrome.
METHODS: Using an individual level microsimulation of a population affected by 
Lynch syndrome over several years, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 21 
screening strategies were compared. Modeling assumptions were based upon 
published literature, and sensitivity analyses were performed for key 
assumptions. In a two-step process, the number of Lynch syndrome diagnoses (Step 
1) and life-years gained as a result of foreknowledge of Lynch syndrome in 
otherwise healthy carriers (Step 2) were measured.
RESULTS: The optimal strategy was sequential screening for probands starting 
with a predictive model, then immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair protein 
expression (IHC), followed by germline mutation testing (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] of $35 143 per life-year gained). The strategies 
of IHC + BRAF, germline testing and universal germline testing of colon cancer 
probands had ICERs of $144 117 and $996 878, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that the initial step in screening for Lynch 
Syndrome should be the use of predictive models in probands. Universal tumor 
testing and general population screening strategies are not cost-effective. When 
family history is unavailable, alternate strategies are appropriate. 
Documentation of family history and screening for Lynch Syndrome using a 
predictive model may be considered a quality-of-care measure for patients with 
colorectal cancer.

Cost-utility analysis of tocilizumab monotherapy in first line versus standard 
of care for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Greece.

The study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding tocilizumab (TCZ) 
first line to a treatment sequence for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), who had an inadequate response to one or more traditional synthetic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and are intolerant to 
methotrexate (MTX), or in whom continued treatment with MTX is considered 
inappropriate. An individual simulation model was applied to project lifetime 
costs and outcomes for 10,000 patients from a payer's perspective. The analysis 
compared the standard treatment pathway (STP) with a similar pathway, where 
treatment was initiated with TCZ. QALYs were used as primary efficacy outcomes. 
Efficacy data were obtained from the ADACTA trial and a network meta-analysis. 
Clinical practice standards were derived from an expert panel of Greek 
rheumatologists. Results indicate that a treatment sequence starting with TCZ 
yields 1.17 more QALYs (9.38 vs. 8.21) at an additional cost of €3,744 (€119,840 
vs. €86,096) compared with the STP. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
€28,837/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirms robustness of 
these findings as consistently below a threshold of €45,000. The results of the 
analysis suggest that TCZ, when used as a first-line biologic monotherapy, can 
be a cost-effective treatment option for the management of active RA in patients 
in need of biologic monotherapy.

PURPOSE: Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA) is a multisystemic storage 
disorder. Patient's disability and life expectancy depends upon skeletal 
complications, including cervical myelopathy due to upper cervical compression 
or instability. Posterior decompression followed by occipitocervical fixation or 
C1-2 fusion are the most frequently recommended surgical interventions. The bony 
elements of C1 and C2 are often inadequately developed making routine screw 
insertion difficult. The main purpose of this work was to present novel 
technique of occipitocervical fixation using two C2 laminar screws.
METHODS: Four children with MPS IVA underwent decompression and C0-C2 
instrumented fusion using two C2 bilateral laminar screws. The dimensions of the 
C2 lamina were measured. Clinical and radiological results were monitored 
prospectively for a minimum 3 years.
RESULTS: The mean laminar length was 24 ± 1.15 mm, width 6.15 ± 0.55 mm and 
height 7.4 ± 0.6 mm. Patients remained in a stable neurological condition. The 
mean antero-posterior diameter of the spinal canal on the pre-operative MR was 
6.2 ± 0.74 mm and it was enlarged to 11.4 ± 0.8 mm after 3 years. All screws 
were placed adequately. In all patients, the control CT scan 2 years 
post-operatively revealed a stable position of the treated segments, but solid 
bony fusion was not registered in any patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Decompression and fusion of the upper cervical spine is a generally 
accepted approach to treat upper cervical spine instability and myelopathy in 
MPS IVA patients. The feasibility and the suitability of the technique of C0-C2 
stabilization using bilateral C2 laminar screws have been presented.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Information about ethnomedicinal plants used by 
traditional healers in Tripura, India is very much limited. As there is rapid 
erosion of traditional knowledge in the state, needs has arisen to document the 
diversity of medicinal plants, their preparation and associated diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Attempts have been made to explore the herbal medicines used 
by the traditional healers belonging to the various communities in North Tripura 
district of Tripura, India and document the associated traditional knowledge on 
the utilisation of medicinal plants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on ethnomedicinal field survey 
covering a period of 1 year from February 2012 to February 2013. The 
ethnomedicinal information was collected by using semi-structured questionnaires 
from different healers and knowledge holders. Collected data were analysed 
through informant consensus factor, Index of Specialisation and Relative 
frequency of citation to determine culturally significant plants.
RESULTS: A total of 75 species of plants under 68 genera belonging to 43 
families were collected during the study for the treatment of 15 disease 
categories. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and most of the 
medicines were prepared in the form of extract and administered orally. FIC 
values of the present study indicated that there was a high agreement in the use 
of plants in the treatment of digestive system disorders and respiratory system 
disorders among the healers. Plants having high ISu are Justicia adhatoda, 
Pajanelia longifolia, Catharanthus roseus etc.
CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted certain species having higher priority 
indices for further phytochemical investigation. Counselling of traditional 
health practitioners should be taken into consideration in order to smooth 
continuation and extension of traditional medical knowledge and practice for 
ensuring safe and effective therapy.

Palliative care for Parkinson's disease: has the time come?

Miyasaki JM(1), Kluger B.

(1)Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, 
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, miyasaki@ualberta.ca.

Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally viewed as a movement disorder 
which affects quality of life, recent literature has revealed an increased 
mortality, a high burden of difficult-to-manage non-motor symptoms (e.g., pain, 
fatigue), high caregiver distress, and a high utilization of medical services 
especially in the last year of life. Current medical systems have yet to 
adequately respond to this mounting evidence through the adoption of palliative 
care practices and through the provision of palliative care services to both PD 
patients and to affected families. This holistic, interdisciplinary approach to 
practice would enhance care delivery, identify and address unmet needs, and 
avoid interventions and hospitalizations especially in the last months of life. 
As we approach an era of increased life expectancy, increasing comorbidities 
among patients, and escalating healthcare costs, physicians must be proactive in 
focusing on quality of life, reducing medical interventions, and respecting 
patient autonomy.

BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a UV-induced, pre-malignant skin condition 
that is common in adults over 60 years of age with fair skin in Scotland. The 
most commonly prescribed first-line treatment for AK in Scotland is currently 
diclofenac gel (3 %). Ingenol mebutate gel is a recently developed topical 
therapy available in two strengths for the treatment of AK lesions on the face 
and scalp (150 mcg/g once daily for 3 consecutive days) or trunk and extremities 
(500 mcg/g once daily for 2 consecutive days).
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of two strengths of ingenol 
mebutate gel developed to treat AK lesions on the face and scalp (150 mcg/g once 
daily for 3 consecutive days) or trunk and extremities (500 mcg/g once daily for 
2 consecutive days) with other first-line AK therapies including diclofenac gel, 
5-FU, 5-FU/salicylic acid, and cryotherapy for the first-line treatment of AK in 
adult patients, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in 
Scotland.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a decision-tree approach to 
calculate the costs and benefits of different treatment strategies for AK on the 
face and scalp or trunk and limbs over a 12-month time horizon. Data on the 
relative efficacy of treatments were obtained from a systematic literature 
review and meta-analysis. Utility scores and resource-use data were obtained 
from published sources.
RESULTS: Over 12 months, ingenol mebutate 150 mcg/g gel and 500 mcg/g gel were 
cost-effective compared with the most commonly used topical therapy in Scotland, 
diclofenac (3 %) gel, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY, 
with a minimal additional cost of £43 and £105, respectively per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Ingenol mebutate gel is a cost-effective therapy for the first-line 
treatment of AK from a Scottish NHS perspective.

OBJECTIVES: With rapid reductions in fertility and mortality, China has to face 
the dramatic ageing of its population. Although an ageing population is 
associated with greater life expectancy, and reflects a huge improvement in 
people's living standards and health care services, it also means that more 
elderly people suffer from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The prolonged 
course of illness and disability associated with chronic diseases may 
significantly reduce health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among elderly 
people. The aims of this study were to evaluate HRQoL of elderly people living 
in Jinzhou, and to identify the predictors of HRQoL.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with stratified sampling.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1015 elderly people (≥60 
years) living in the three administrative regions (Linghe, Guta and Taihe) of 
Jinzhou. A demographic questionnaire and Short Form-36 were employed to collect 
demographic variables and evaluate HRQoL, respectively. Multiple stepwise linear 
regression analysis was performed to estimate factors related to HRQoL of the 
subjects.
RESULTS: Lowest HRQoL scores were obtained in the following dimensions: general 
health (65.44), role-emotional (69.74) and role-physical (70.20). Multiple 
stepwise regression showed that factors associated with HRQoL of elderly people 
were medical health checks, age, socio-economic status, NCDs, and various 
unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as smoking, excessive drinking and 
insufficient exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: This study described overall HRQoL of elderly people in Jinzhou, 
and found that medical health checks, age, socio-economic status, NCDs, smoking, 
excessive drinking and insufficient exercise affected HRQoL. These findings will 
provide a basis for recommendations regarding health management of elderly 
people, and will also help local government to devise appropriate health 
intervention strategies for promoting the health status of elderly people in 
this region.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of two 
smoking cessation counseling interventions differing in their modality for 
patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease from a societal perspective.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial conducted in Dutch hospital wards, 
cardiac patients who smoked prior to admission were allocated to usual care (n = 
245), telephone counseling (n = 223) or face-to-face counseling (n = 157). The 
counseling interventions lasted for 3 months and were complemented by nicotine 
patches. Baseline histories were obtained, and interviews took place 6 months 
after hospitalization to assess self-reported smoking status and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quitter 
and cost-utility ratios per QALY were calculated and presented in acceptability 
curves. Uncertainty was accounted for by sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Using continued abstinence as the outcome measure showed that telephone 
counseling had the highest probability of being cost-effective. Face-to-to-face 
counseling was also more cost-effective than usual care. No significant 
improvements and differences in QALYs between the three conditions were found. 
Varying costs and effect estimations revealed that the results of the primary 
analyses were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming a willingness-to-pay of €20,000 per abstinent patient, 
telephone counseling would be a highly cost-effective smoking cessation 
intervention assisting cardiac patients to quit. However, the lack of consensus 
concerning the willingness-to-pay per quitter impedes drawing firm conclusions. 
Moreover, studies with extended follow-up periods are needed to capture late 
relapses and possible differences in QALYs.

Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Department of Internal Medicine III, 
University Hospital Regensburg.

BACKGROUND: Over 3000 persons undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation (allo-HSCT) in Germany every year. Advances in allo-HSCT have 
prolonged the survival of treated patients but have concomitantly increased the 
risk of long-term complications that impair their quality of life.
METHODS: This literature review of the long-term sequelae of allo-HSCT is based 
on pertinent articles that were retrieved by a selective search of PubMed, and 
on current international guidelines. Case reports were excluded from 
consideration.
RESULTS: Hardly any randomized clinical trials have been performed to 
investigate the long-term outcome of allo-HSCT, but international 
consensus-based guidelines have been published. 50% to 70% of patients treated 
with allo-HSCT develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) within ten 
years of treatment. Transplant recipients are at higher risk of infection, 
including the reactivation of dormant herpes viruses; therefore, vaccination is 
recommended, as described in the current guidelines. Gonadal dysfunction arises 
in up to 92% of men and up to 99% of women; its frequency depends on the timing 
of transplantation, on radiotherapy, and on other factors. The medications that 
transplant recipients need to take can impair liver function, and 
transfusionassociated hemosiderosis can do so as well. 40% to 50% of patients 
suffer from lipid metabolic disturbances that increase the risk of myocardial 
infarction, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, and stroke. Their life 
expectancy is shorter than that of the overall population.
CONCLUSION: Measures should be taken to prevent the potential long-term 
complications of allo-HSCT. All patients who have been treated with allo-HSCT 
should receive individualized, risk-adapted, and multidisciplinary follow-up 
care, so that any complications that arise can be correctly diagnosed and 
appropriately treated. Long-term follow-up care could be improved by prospective 
clinical trials investigating the long-term sequelae of allo-HSCT, as well as by 
consistent, uniform documentation of these sequelae in supraregional data 
registries.

Over the past few decades, the longest extension in life expectancy in the world 
has been observed in Japan. However, the sophistication of medical care and the 
expansion of the aging society, leads to continuous increase in health-care 
costs. Medical expenses as a part of gross domestic product (GDP) in Japan are 
exceeding the current Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) average, challenging the universally, equally provided low cost health 
care existing in the past. A universal health insurance system is becoming a 
common system currently in developed countries, currently a similar system is 
being introduced in the United States. Medical care in Japan is under a social 
insurance system, but the injection of public funds for medical costs becomes 
very expensive for the Japanese society. In spite of some urgently decided 
measures to cover the high cost of advanced medical treatment, declining 
birthrate and aging population and the tendency to reduce hospital and 
outpatients' visits numbers and shorten hospital stays, medical expenses of 
Japan continue to be increasing.

Individuals who sustain fragility fractures are at high risk of refracture. 
However, osteoporosis treatment rates remain low for these patients. Therefore, 
we aimed to assess the performance and cost-effectiveness of introducing a 
fracture liaison service (FLS) into a tertiary hospital. In "nonhospitalized" 
ambulatory patients who had sustained fragility fractures, we assessed baseline 
osteoporosis investigation and treatment rates, and subsequently, the impact of 
introducing an orthopedic osteoporosis policy and an FLS. Outcomes measured were 
uptake of osteoporosis intervention, patient satisfaction, and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained. QALYs were calculated over 5 years using predicted 
fracture risks without intervention and estimated fracture risk reduction with 
intervention. At baseline (n = 49), 2% of ambulatory patients who had sustained 
fragility fractures underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 6% 
received osteoporosis-specific medication. After introduction of an osteoporosis 
policy (n = 58), 28% were investigated with DXA (p < 0.0001). However, treatment 
rates were unchanged. An FLS was introduced, reviewing 203 new patients over the 
inaugural 2 years (mean age [standard deviation], 67 (11) years; 77% female). 
All underwent DXA, and criteria for osteoporosis and osteopenia were identified 
in 44% and 40%, respectively. Osteoporosis medications were prescribed to 61% 
patients (risedronate: 22%, alendronate: 16%, strontium ranelate: 13%, 
zoledronic acid: 8%, other: 2%). Eighty-five of 90 questionnaire respondents 
were very satisfied or satisfied with the FLS. With the treatment prescribed 
over 5 years, we conservatively estimated that this FLS would reduce 
nonvertebral refractures from 59 to 50, improving QALYs by 0.054 and costing 
$1716 per patient (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $31749). This FLS model 
improves uptake of osteoporosis intervention guidelines, is popular among 
patients, and improves cost-effectiveness. Thus, it has the capacity to 
substantially improve health in a cost-effective way.

Impact of the circadian clock on the aging process.

The increase of life expectancy and the decline of biological functions with 
advancing age are impending obstacles for our society. In general, age-related 
changes can be separated into two processes. Primary aging is based on programs 
governing gradual changes which are generally not harmful. On the other hand, 
secondary aging or senescence is more aleatory in nature and it is at this stage 
that the progressive impairment of metabolic, physiological, and neurological 
functions increases the risk of death. Exploiting genetic animal models, we 
obtain more and more information on the underlying regulatory networks. The aim 
of this review is to identify potential links between the output of the 
circadian oscillator and secondary aging. The reasons to suspect such links rely 
on the fact that the mouse models without functional circadian clocks sometimes 
exhibit reduced life expectancy. This may be due to their inability to properly 
control and synchronize energy expenditure, affecting, for example, the 
integrity of neurons in the brain. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that 
re-synchronization of metabolic and physiological functions by the circadian 
clock may slow down the aging process.

IMPORTANCE: For patients with limited prognosis, some medication risks may 
outweigh the benefits, particularly when benefits take years to accrue; statins 
are one example. Data are lacking regarding the risks and benefits of 
discontinuing statin therapy for patients with limited life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, clinical, and cost impact of discontinuing 
statin medications for patients in the palliative care setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter, parallel-group, 
unblinded, pragmatic clinical trial. Eligibility included adults with an 
estimated life expectancy of between 1 month and 1 year, statin therapy for 3 
months or more for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, 
recent deterioration in functional status, and no recent active cardiovascular 
disease. Participants were randomized to either discontinue or continue statin 
therapy and were monitored monthly for up to 1 year. The study was conducted 
from June 3, 2011, to May 2, 2013. All analyses were performed using an 
intent-to-treat approach.
INTERVENTIONS: Statin therapy was withdrawn from eligible patients who were 
randomized to the discontinuation group. Patients in the continuation group 
continued to receive statins.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included death within 60 days (primary 
outcome), survival, cardiovascular events, performance status, quality of life 
(QOL), symptoms, number of nonstatin medications, and cost savings.
RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were enrolled; 189 of these were randomized to 
discontinue statins, and 192 were randomized to continue therapy. Mean (SD) age 
was 74.1 (11.6) years, 22.0% of the participants were cognitively impaired, and 
48.8% had cancer. The proportion of participants in the discontinuation vs 
continuation groups who died within 60 days was not significantly different 
(23.8% vs 20.3%; 90% CI, -3.5% to 10.5%; P=.36) and did not meet the 
noninferiority end point. Total QOL was better for the group discontinuing 
statin therapy (mean McGill QOL score, 7.11 vs 6.85; P=.04). Few participants 
experienced cardiovascular events (13 in the discontinuation group vs 11 in the 
continuation group). Mean cost savings were $3.37 per day and $716 per patient.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This pragmatic trial suggests that stopping statin 
medication therapy is safe and may be associated with benefits including 
improved QOL, use of fewer nonstatin medications, and a corresponding reduction 
in medication costs. Thoughtful patient-provider discussions regarding the 
uncertain benefit and potential decrement in QOL associated with statin 
continuation in this setting are warranted.

BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of cognitive impairment is an increasing 
challenge with the ageing of our populations but little is known about the 
burden in low- and middle- income Latin American and Caribbean countries (LAC) 
that are aging more rapidly than their developed counterparts. We examined life 
expectancies with cognitive impairment (CILE) and free of cognitive impairment 
(CIFLE) in seven developing LAC countries.
METHODS: Data from The Survey on Health, Well-being and Ageing in LAC (N = 
10,597) was utilised and cognitive status was assessed by the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE). The Sullivan Method was applied to estimate CILE and CIFLE. 
Logistic regression was used to determine the effect of age, gender and 
education on cognitive outcome. Meta-regression models were fitted for all 7 
countries together to investigate the relationship between CIFLE and education 
in men and women at age 60.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CI increased with age in all countries except Uruguay 
and with a significant gender effect observed only in Mexico where men had lower 
odds of CI compared to women [OR = 0.464 95% CInt (0.268 - 0.806)]. Low 
education was associated with increased prevalence of CI in Brazil [OR = 4.848 
(1.173-20.044)], Chile [OR = 3.107 (1.098-8.793), Cuba [OR = 2.295 
(1.247-4.225)] and Mexico [OR = 3.838 (1.368-10.765). For males, total life 
expectancy (TLE) at age 60 was highest in Cuba (19.7 years) and lowest in Brazil 
and Uruguay (17.6 years). TLE for females at age 60 was highest for Chileans 
(22.8 years) and lowest for Brazilians (20.2 years). CIFLE for men was greatest 
in Cuba (19.0 years) and least in Brazil (16.7 years). These differences did not 
appear to be explained by educational level (Men: p = 0.408, women: p = 0.695).
CONCLUSION: Increasing age, female sex and low education were associated with 
higher CI in LAC reflecting patterns found in other countries.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate health expectancies based on measures that more fully 
cover the stages in the disablement process for the older Thais and examine 
gender differences in these health expectancies.
METHODS: Health expectancies by genders using Sullivan's method were computed 
from the fourth Thai National Health Examination Survey conducted in 2009. A 
total of 9,210 participants aged 60 years and older were included in the 
analysis. Health measures included chronic diseases; cognitive impairment; 
depression; disability in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL); and 
disability in activities of daily living (ADL).
RESULTS: The average number of years lived with and without morbidity and 
disability as measured by multiple dimensions of health varied and gender 
differences were not consistent across measures. At age 60, males could expect 
to live the most years on average free of depression (18.6 years) and ADL 
disability (18.6 years) and the least years free of chronic diseases (9.1 
years). Females, on the contrary, could expect to live the most years free of 
ADL disability (21.7 years) and the least years free of IADL disability (8.1 
years), and they consistently spent more years with all forms of morbidity and 
disability. Finally, and for both genders, years lived with cognitive 
impairment, depression and ADL disability were almost constant with increasing 
age.
CONCLUSION: This study adds knowledge of gender differences in healthy life 
expectancy in the older Thai population using a wider spectrum of health which 
provides useful information to diverse policy audiences.

BACKGROUND: Patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) require 
artificial ventilation but this treatment may produce secondary lung damage. 
High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may reduce this damage.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of HFOV in 
patients with ARDS compared with standard mechanical ventilation.
DESIGN: A parallel, randomised, unblinded clinical trial.
SETTING: UK intensive care units.
PARTICIPANTS: Mechanically ventilated patients with a partial pressure of oxygen 
in arterial blood/fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (P : F) ratio of 
26.7 kPa (200 mmHg) or less and an expected duration of ventilation of at least 
2 days at recruitment.
INTERVENTIONS: Treatment arm HFOV using a Novalung R100(®) ventilator (Metran 
Co. Ltd, Saitama, Japan) ventilator until the start of weaning. Control 
arm Conventional mechanical ventilation using the devices available in the 
participating centres.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 
30 days after randomisation. The primary health economic outcome was the cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-six of 398 patients (41.7%) randomised to the 
HFOV group and 163 of 397 patients (41.1%) randomised to the conventional 
mechanical ventilation group died within 30 days of randomisation (p = 0.85), 
for an absolute difference of 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) -6.1% to 7.5%]. 
After adjustment for study centre, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
Evaluation II score, and the initial P : F ratio, the odds ratio for survival in 
the conventional ventilation group was 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.40; p = 0.87 
logistic regression). Survival analysis showed no difference in the probability 
of survival up to 12 months after randomisation. The average QALY at 1 year in 
the HFOV group was 0.302 compared to 0.246. This gives an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the cost to society per QALY of £88,790 and 
an ICER for the cost to the NHS per QALY of £ 78,260.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of HFOV had no effect on 30-day mortality in adult patients 
undergoing mechanical ventilation for ARDS and no economic advantage. We suggest 
that further research into avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury should 
concentrate on ventilatory strategies other than HFOV.

BACKGROUND: A core concept behind patient-centred approaches is the need to 
treat people with, and preserve, dignity in care settings. People receiving 
palliative care are one group who may have particularly sensitive needs in terms 
of their condition, symptoms and life expectancy. Dignity is more likely to be 
violated in hospital settings. Given the high percentage of people with 
palliative care needs who are admitted to hospital during their last year of 
life, the provision of dignity enhancing and preserving care in that setting is 
of vital importance.
AIM: To examine international evidence relating to dignity and person-centred 
care for people with palliative care needs in the acute hospital setting.
DESIGN: A systematic literature review was conducted, incorporating data 
extraction, analysis and quality appraisal of included papers.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA, EMBASE, Cochrane Database and 
Web of Science. Inclusion dates: 1 January 2000-1 April 2014.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Adult palliative care, acute care setting, dignity or 
person-centred care.
RESULTS: In all, 33 papers met the inclusion criteria for the review. Papers 
highlighted the many and varied potential threats to dignity for people with 
palliative care needs in acute settings, including symptom control and 
existential distress, approaches and models in care provision and healthcare 
settings and design.
CONCLUSION: Acute hospital staff require adequate training, including symptom 
control, and the correct environment in which to deliver dignified and 
person-centred end-of-life care. Specific models/approaches to care can be 
beneficial, if adequate training regarding implementation is given. The needs of 
family members also require consideration, particularly following bereavement.

More than twenty years ago, hydroxyapatite (HA), calcium phosphate ceramics, was 
introduced as a coating for cementless hip prostheses. The choice of this 
ceramic is due to its composition being similar to organic apatite bone 
crystals. This ceramic is biocompatible, bioactive, and osteoconductive. These 
qualities facilitate the primary stability and osseointegration of implants. Our 
surgical experience includes the implantation of more than 4,000 cementless 
hydroxyapatite coated hip prostheses since 1990. The models implanted are coated 
with HA in the acetabulum and in the metaphyseal area of the stem. The results 
corresponding to survival and stability of implants were very satisfactory in 
the long-term. From our experience, HA-coated hip implants are a reliable 
alternative which can achieve long term survival, provided that certain 
requirements are met: good design selection, sound choice of bearing surfaces 
based on patient life expectancy, meticulous surgical technique, and indications
