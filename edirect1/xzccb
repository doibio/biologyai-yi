BACKGROUND: The number of hip fractures is rising as life expectancy increases. 
As such, the number of centenarians sustaining these fractures is also 
increasing. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients who are 
≥100 years old and sustain a hip fracture fare worse in the hospital than those 
who are younger.
METHODS: Using a large database, the New York Statewide Planning and Research 
Cooperative System (SPARCS), we identified patients who were ≥65 years old and 
had been treated for a hip fracture over a 12-year period. Data on demographics, 
comorbidities, and treatment were collected. Three cohorts were established: 
patients who were 65 to 80 years old, 81 to 99 years old, and ≥100 years old 
(centenarians). Outcome measures included hospital length of stay, estimated 
total costs, and in-hospital mortality rates.
RESULTS: A total of 168,087 patients with a hip fracture were identified, and 
1,150 (0.7%) of them had sustained the fracture when they were ≥100 years old. 
Centenarians incurred costs and had lengths of stay that were similar to those 
of younger patients. Despite the similarities, centenarians were found to have a 
significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate than the younger populations 
(7.4% compared with 4.4% for those 81 to 99 years old and 2.6% for those 65 to 
80 years old; p < 0.01). Male sex and an increasing number of medical 
comorbidities were found to predict in-hospital mortality for centenarians 
sustaining extracapsular hip fractures. No significant predictors of in-hospital 
mortality were identified for centenarians who sustained femoral neck fractures. 
An increased time to surgery did not influence the odds of in-hospital 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Centenarians had increased in-hospital mortality, but the remaining 
short-term outcomes were comparable with those for the younger cohorts with 
similar fracture patterns. For this extremely elderly population, time to 
surgery does not appear to affect short-term mortality rates, suggesting a 
potential benefit to preoperative optimization.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a lifestyle modification program targeting 
long-term survivors of hematological malignancy treated with hemopoietic stem 
cell transplantation, a multistate life table Markov model was used to calculate 
health outcomes for both the intervention and no intervention. Cost per 
health-adjusted life year (HALY) saved was reported for four scenarios: all 
participants with/without standard weight regain, and participants who at 
baseline were overweight with/without standard weight regain. The program 
recruited 53 participants and was associated with reductions in body weight of 
2.2 kg and BMI 0.8 units on intervention completion (12 months) at a cost of 
$1233/participant. These adipose reductions were sustained and remained 
significant at 24 months. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied from 
$118 418 per HALY to dominant, depending on the weight regain assumption. The 
program may be cost-effective in transplant survivors, with the results most 
sensitive to the weight regain assumption and intervention cost.

BACKGROUND: A 3-month long treatment of paliperidone palmitate (PP3M) has been 
introduced as an option for treating schizophrenia. Its cost-effectiveness in 
Spain has not been established.
AIMS: To compare the costs and effects of PP3M compared with once-monthly 
paliperidone (PP1M) from the payer perspective in Spain.
METHODS: This study used the recently published trial by Savitz et al. as a core 
model over 1 year. Additional data were derived from the literature. Costs in 
2016 Euros were obtained from official lists and utilities from Osborne et al. 
The authors conducted both cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses. For the 
former, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was 
calculated. For the latter, the outcomes were relapses and hospitalizations 
avoided. To assure the robustness of the analyses, a series of 1-way and 
probability sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The expected cost was lower with PP3M (4,780€) compared with PP1M 
(5,244€). PP3M had the fewest relapses (0.080 vs 0.161), hospitalizations (0.034 
v.s 0.065), and emergency room visits (0.045 v.s 0.096) and the most QALYs 
(0.677 v.s 0.625). In both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, PP3M 
dominated PP1M. Sensitivity analyses confirmed base case findings. For the 
primary analysis (cost-utility), PP3M dominated PP1M in 46.9% of 10,000 
simulations and was cost-effective at a threshold of 30,000€/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: PP3M dominated PP1M in all analyses and was, therefore, 
cost-effective for treating chronic relapsing schizophrenia in Spain. For 
patients who require long-acting therapy, PP3M appears to be a good alternative 
anti-psychotic treatment.

BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) have limited life 
expectancy. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of intrapleural 
perfusion with hyperthermic chemotherapy (IPHC) under video-assisted 
thoracoscopic surgery on MPE patients.
METHODS: MPE patients were enrolled in the study and treated with IPHC. The 
treatment response was classified as complete response (CR, no re-accumulation 
of pleural fluid for 4 weeks), partial response (PR, re-accumulation above the 
post-IPHC level but below the pre-IPHC level for four weeks), no response (NR; 
re-accumulation or above the pre-IPHC level). The change of Karnofsky 
performance score (KPS) and tumour markers were also recorded. Follow-up was 
done every two weeks during first month and monthly thereafter until death.
RESULTS: Eighty patients included 46 males and 34 females were included in the 
study. The total response rate was 100%, with 71.3% of CR and 28.7% of PR. The 
KPS scores were significantly elevated and the level of tumour markers in 
pleural effusion were dramatically decreased after IPHC. The median survival was 
16.8 months ranged from 2.1 to 67.4 months. One-year and two-year survival rates 
were 82.5% and 23.8%, respectively. There were no serious clinical compilations 
during IPHC treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: IPHC is a safety, effective and promising approach for MPE 
patients. It provides well survival benefit and minor toxicities.

OBJECTIVES: From the first time that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 
discovered, till today both the quality of life and survival expectancy of 
HIV-infected patients have markedly improved. As the life expectancy of these 
patients increases due to the use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy 
(HAART) also increases the number of HIV-positive patient to be subjected to an 
operation. Different studies have examined the occurrence of complications in 
this particular group of patients and their possible susceptibility to 
infections or other complications that could lead to increased hospital stay, 
morbidity and mortality with controversial results.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 25 HIV-patients 
that were subjected to general surgery and urologic operations and we also 
examined in comparison with the Charlson score and their comorbidities the 
occurrence of complications and subsequently the possibility of an increase 
hospital stay due to their HIV infection. Alongside we classified their 
complications according to the Clavien-Dindo and compared these complications in 
relation to their Charlson score and CD4 count.
RESULTS: 10/25 (40%) of the population had prolonged hospital stay and from this 
population 6 (6/25) (24%) patients had less than 200 CD4 constituting the AIDS 
subpopulation. The decline of the CD4 count showed a tendency for the occurrence 
of a complication and comorbidities to HIV-positive patients seem to affect more 
the AIDS subpopulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a small retrospective study, we tried to classify 
our complications according to the Clavien- Dindo classification and combine the 
classification to the age adjusted Charlson score index of comorbidities.

Healthy ageing, resilience and wellbeing.

The extension of life does not appear to be slowing, representing a great 
achievement for mankind as well as a challenge for ageing populations. As we 
move towards an increasingly older population we will need to find novel ways 
for individuals to make the best of the challenges they face, as the likelihood 
of encountering some form of adversity increases with age. Resilience theories 
share a common idea that individuals who manage to navigate adversity and 
maintain high levels of functioning demonstrate resilience. Traditional models 
of healthy ageing suggest that having a high level of functioning across a 
number of domains is a requirement. The addition of adversity to the healthy 
ageing model via resilience makes this concept much more accessible and more 
amenable to the ageing population. Through asset-based approaches, such as the 
invoking of individual, social and environmental resources, it is hoped that 
greater resilience can be fostered at a population level. Interventions aimed at 
fostering greater resilience may take many forms; however, there is great 
potential to increase social and environmental resources through public policy 
interventions. The wellbeing of the individual must be the focus of these 
efforts; quality of life is an integral component to the enjoyment of additional 
years and should not be overlooked. Therefore, it will become increasingly 
important to use resilience as a public health concept and to intervene through 
policy to foster greater resilience by increasing resources available to older 
people. Fostering wellbeing in the face of increasing adversity has significant 
implications for ageing individuals and society as a whole.

Objective To forecast dementia prevalence with a dynamic modelling approach that 
integrates calendar trends in dementia incidence with those for mortality and 
cardiovascular disease.Design Modelling study.Setting General adult population 
of England and Wales.Participants The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 
(ELSA) is a representative panel study with six waves of data across 2002-13. 
Men and women aged 50 or more years, selected randomly, and their cohabiting 
partners were recruited to the first wave of ELSA (2002-03). 11392 adults 
participated (response rate 67%). To maintain representativeness, refreshment 
participants were recruited to the study at subsequent waves. The total 
analytical sample constituted 17 906 people. Constant objective criteria based 
on cognitive and functional impairment were used to ascertain dementia cases at 
each wave.Main outcome measures To estimate calendar trends in dementia 
incidence, correcting for bias due to loss to follow-up of study participants, a 
joint model of longitudinal and time-to-event data was fitted to ELSA data. To 
forecast future dementia prevalence, the probabilistic Markov model IMPACT-BAM 
(IMPACT-Better Ageing Model) was developed. IMPACT-BAM models transitions of the 
population aged 35 or more years through states of cardiovascular disease, 
cognitive and functional impairment, and dementia, to death. It enables 
prediction of dementia prevalence while accounting for the growing pool of 
susceptible people as a result of increased life expectancy and the competing 
effects due to changes in mortality, and incidence of cardiovascular 
disease.Results In ELSA, dementia incidence was estimated at 14.3 per 1000 
person years in men and 17.0/1000 person years in women aged 50 or more in 2010. 
Dementia incidence declined at a relative rate of 2.7% (95% confidence interval 
2.4% to 2.9%) for each year during 2002-13. Using IMPACT-BAM, we estimated there 
were approximately 767 000 (95% uncertainty interval 735 000 to 797 000) people 
with dementia in England and Wales in 2016. Despite the decrease in incidence 
and age specific prevalence, the number of people with dementia is projected to 
increase to 872 000, 1 092 000, and 1 205 000 in 2020, 2030, and 2040, 
respectively. A sensitivity analysis without the incidence decline gave a much 
larger projected growth, of more than 1.9 million people with dementia in 
2040.Conclusions Age specific dementia incidence is declining. The number of 
people with dementia in England and Wales is likely to increase by 57% from 2016 
to 2040. This increase is mainly driven by improved life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol is a risk factor for ill health and reduced life expectancy, 
but little is known about the impact of alcohol on mortality for people with 
existing long-term conditions. We used primary care data from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to study relationships between alcohol 
consumption and all-cause mortality among general practice patients with 
long-term conditions.
METHODS: Data were accessed from a sample of 125 general practices from the CPRD 
database. Adult patients with long-term health conditions, a record of alcohol 
consumption in CPRD and at least 1 year of follow-up data between 2000 and 2014 
(n=95 991) were matched to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality 
register.
RESULTS: In Cox proportional hazards regression models, mortality was higher for 
patients consuming 25-34 units of alcohol per week (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12 to 
1.42) and 35 units or more (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.94), compared with those 
drinking 1-7 units per week. Patterns of mortality risk were the same for men 
and women. Heavy drinking increased mortality risk in combination with smoking 
(HR 4.04, 95% CI 3.41 to 4.79) and high levels of deprivation (HR 3.01, 95% CI 
2.40 to 3.79).
CONCLUSIONS: Heavier drinkers with long-term conditions are at significantly 
greater risk of death than lighter drinkers. The findings support the UK Chief 
Medical Officers' guidance on having similar low-risk alcohol consumption 
guidelines for men and women. More needs to be done to tackle alcohol 
consumption among patients with long-term conditions.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of a risk stratification 
pathway, compared with standard care, for detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) in primary care.
SETTING: Primary care general practices in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults who have been identified in primary care to have a risk 
factor for developing NAFLD, that is, type 2 diabetes without a history of 
excessive alcohol use.
INTERVENTION: A community-based pathway, which uses transient elastography and 
hepatologists to stratify patients at risk of NAFLD, has been implemented and 
demonstrated to be feasible (NCT02037867). Earlier identification could mean 
earlier treatments, referral to specialist and enrolment into surveillance 
programmes.
DESIGN: The impact of earlier detection and treatment with the risk 
stratification pathway on progression to later stages of liver disease was 
examined using decision modelling with Markov chains to estimate lifetime health 
and economic effects of the two comparators.
DATA SOURCES: Data from a prospective cross-sectional feasibility study 
indicating risk stratification pathway and standard care diagnostic accuracies 
were combined with a Markov model that comprised the following states: no/mild 
liver disease, significant liver disease, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated 
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant and death. The model data 
were chosen from up-to-date UK sources, published literature and an expert 
panel.
OUTCOME MEASURE: An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating cost 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the risk stratification pathway 
compared with standard care was estimated.
RESULTS: The risk stratification pathway was more effective than standard care 
and costs £2138 per QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to estimates of the 
rate of fibrosis progression and the effect of treatment on reducing this, and 
ranged from -£1895 to £7032/QALY. The risk stratification pathway demonstrated 
an 85% probability of cost-effectiveness at the UK willingness-to-pay threshold 
of £20 000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a community-based risk stratification pathway is 
likely to be cost-effective.

Though some studies have explored the association between temperature and years 
of life lost (YLL), limited evidence is available regarding the effect of 
temporal variation on the temperature-YLL relationship, especially in developing 
countries. We explored temporal variation in the associations between 
temperature and YLL before and after 2013 heat waves (period I: Jan 2008 to Sep 
2013, period II: Oct 2013 to Dec 2015) in Ningbo, a southern China city with 
typical subtropical climate. The heat associations showed an increasing trend. 
The number of YLL due to heat-related respiratory mortality was significantly 
higher in period II (46.03, 95% CI: 11.97, 80.08) than in period I (7.21, 95% 
CI: -10.04, 24.46) among married individuals. In contrast, the cold associations 
presented an attenuating trend, and the number of YLL due to non-accidental 
mortality was significantly lower in period II (262.32, 95% CI: -304.18, 828.83) 
than in period I (916.78, 95% CI: 596.05, 1237.51). These results indicate more 
effort still needed to be made to reduce heat-related YLL even after periods of 
extreme heat. Furthermore, using YLL provided complementary information for 
identifying vulnerable subgroups, which has important implications for the 
planning of public health interventions.

AIM OF THE STUDY: β-thalassaemia (β-Thal) is considered a severe, progressive 
haemolytic anaemia, which needs regular blood transfusions for life expectancy. 
Complement-mediated erythrocyte destruction can cause both intravascular and 
extravascular haemolysis. Complement regulatory proteins protect cells from such 
effects of the complement system. We aimed to perform quantitative analysis of 
membrane-bound complement regulators, CD55 (decay accelerating factor - DAF), 
CD35 (complement receptor type 1 - CR1), and CD59 (membrane attack complex 
inhibitory factor - MACIF) on peripheral red blood cells by flow cytometry.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study was carried out on 47 β-thalassemia 
major (β-TM) patients, 20 β-thalassaemia intermedia (β-TI) patients, and 17 
healthy volunteers as control subjects.
RESULTS: CD55 levels of β-TM patients (58.64 ±17.06%) were significantly 
decreased compared to β-TI patients (83.34 ±13.82%) and healthy controls (88.57 
±11.69%) (p < 0.01). CD59 levels of β-TM patients were not significantly 
different than β-TI patients and controls, but CD35 levels were significantly 
lower in the β-TM patients (3.56 ±4.87%) and β-TI patients (12.48 ±9.19%) than 
in the control group (39.98 ±15.01%) (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of CD55 and CD35 in thalassaemia major patients 
indicates a role for them in the aetiopathogenesis of haemolysis in this 
disease, and also this defect in a complement system may be responsible for the 
chronic complications seen in these patients.

BACKGROUND: The health status of Indigenous populations of Australia and New 
Zealand (NZ) Māori manifests as life expectancies substantially lower than the 
total population. Accurate assessment of time trends in mortality and life 
expectancy allows evaluation of progress in reduction of health inequalities 
compared to the national or non-Indigenous population.
METHODS: Age-specific mortality and life expectancy (at birth) (LE) for 
Indigenous populations (Australia from 1990 and NZ from 1950); and all Australia 
and non-Māori NZ (from 1890), males (M) and females (F), were obtained from 
published sources and national statistical agency reports. Period trends were 
assessed for credible estimates of Indigenous LE, and the LE gap compared to the 
total population for Australia, and non-Māori for NZ. Period trends in premature 
adult mortality, as cumulative probability of dying over 15-59 years, were 
assessed similarly. The relative contribution of differences in age-specific 
mortality to the LE gap between Indigenous and the all-Australia population, and 
the non-Māori NZ, was estimated for each country by sex for the most recent 
period: 2010-2012 for Australia, 2012-2014 for NZ.
RESULTS: LE increased for all populations, although LE gaps between Indigenous 
and all Australia showed little change over time. LE gaps between NZ Māori and 
non-Māori increased significantly from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, and 
since then have fallen again. Recent LE gaps in Australia (M 12.5; F 12.0 years 
in 2010-2012) were larger than in NZ (M 7.3; F 6.8 years in 2012-2014). 
Premature adult mortality (15-59 years) improved for all populations, but 
mortality ratios show little change since 2000, with Indigenous at 3½-4 times 
that of all Australians, and Māori 2-3 times that of non-Māori. Using 
decomposition analysis, the age interval contributing most strongly to 
differences in LE between Indigenous and all Australia was 35-59 years, but 
between Māori and non-Māori it was 60-74 years.
CONCLUSION: In Australia and NZ, Indigenous LE and adult mortality are improving 
in absolute terms, but not relative to the entire or non-Indigenous populations, 
causing gaps in life expectancy to persist.

In vertebrates ageing is characterized by reduced viscoelasticity of the 
ligamentous and tendineous structures and fibre changes in muscle. Also, some 
vertebral joint degeneration develops with ageing. The aim of this study was to 
apply dynamic time warping to compare the temporal characteristics of the 
surface electromyography (sEMG) data and to illustrate the differences in the 
pattern of muscle use during tasks of daily life in old and mature horses. In 
vivo kinematics (24 skin markers) and sEMG measurements of neck extensors and 
flexors were taken in five mature horses (age 10 ± 2 years, half of mean life 
expectancy) and five old horses (age 25 ± 5 years, older than the mean life 
expectancy). All horses had the same level of activity in the 12 months prior to 
the measurement. Tasks measured were neck flexion and neck extension as well as 
neutral neck position. Muscle activation, minimum and maximum muscle activation 
were collected. Quartiles of muscle activity based on the maximum observed 
activity of each muscle were calculated to document the relative increase of 
activity level during the task. Kinematics as well as overall muscle activity 
patterns were similar across horses and age groups. However, in the neutral 
position old horses showed increased extensor activity compared to mature 
horses, indicating that old equine muscle requires more activity to counteract 
gravity. Dynamic time warping specified optimal temporal alignments of time 
series, and different temporal performances were identified. The age groups 
differed during the flexion task, while extension and neutral were more similar. 
The results of this study show that even in the second half of life and in the 
absence of muscle disuse the muscular strategy employed by horses continues to 
be adapted.

BACKGROUND: Reports of a single case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
eradication suggest that elimination of HIV from individuals is possible. 
Anticipating both increased research funding and the development of effective, 
durable cure technologies, we describe the circumstances under which a cure 
might improve survival and be cost-effective in South Africa.
METHODS: We adapted a simulation model comparing a hypothetical cure strategy 
("Cure") to the standard of care, lifetime antiretroviral therapy 
("LifetimeART") among adherent South Africans (58% female; mean age 33.8 years; 
mean CD4 257/µL; virologic suppression ≥1 year). We portrayed cure as a single 
intervention, producing sustained viral eradication without ART. We considered 
both a plausible, more imminently achievable "Baseline Scenario" and a more 
aspirational "Optimistic Scenario". Inputs (Baseline/Optimistic) included the 
following: 50%/75% efficacy; 0.6%/0.0% fatal toxicity; 0.37%/0.085% monthly 
relapse over 5 years (0.185%/0.0425% per month thereafter); and $2000/$500 cost. 
These inputs were varied extensively in sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: At baseline, Cure was "dominated," yielding lower discounted life 
expectancy (19.31 life-years [LY] vs 19.37 LY) and greater discounted lifetime 
costs ($13 800 vs $13 700) than LifetimeART. Under optimistic assumptions, Cure 
was "cost-saving," producing greater survival (19.91 LY) and lower lifetime 
costs ($11 000) than LifetimeART. Findings were highly sensitive to data 
assumptions, leaving little middle ground where a tradeoff existed between 
improved survival and higher costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Only under the most favorable performance assumptions will an HIV 
cure strategy prove clinically and economically justifiable in South Africa. The 
scientific pursuit of a cure should not undermine continued expansions of access 
to proven, effective, and cost-effective ART.

Evaluating the predictive ability of mortality forecasts is important yet 
difficult. Death rates and mean lifespan are basic life table functions 
typically used to analyze to what extent the forecasts deviate from their 
realized values. Although these parameters are useful for specifying precisely 
how mortality has been forecasted, they cannot be used to assess whether the 
underlying mortality developments are plausible. We therefore propose that in 
addition to looking at average lifespan, we should examine whether the 
forecasted variability of the age at death is a plausible continuation of past 
trends. The validation of mortality forecasts for Italy, Japan, and Denmark 
demonstrates that their predictive performance can be evaluated more 
comprehensively by analyzing both the average lifespan and lifespan 
disparity-that is, by jointly analyzing the mean and the dispersion of 
mortality. Approaches that account for dynamic age shifts in survival 
improvements appear to perform better than others that enforce relatively 
invariant patterns. However, because forecasting approaches are designed to 
capture trends in average mortality, we argue that studying lifespan disparity 
may also help to improve the methodology and thus the predictive ability of 
mortality forecasts.

There are a number of hard to reach and underserved communities who experience 
inadequate health care. In Australia, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders 
peoples experience low life expectancy, higher levels for chronic disease and 
elevated smoking and drinking. These problems are further exacerbated when 
living in regional and rural Australia and poverty. There are growing concerns 
over helping such groups in order to close the health disparity gap. A 
student-led clinic (SLC) was developed to address clinical placement shortages 
while providing free health and social services in an underserved community in 
regional Australia. Health data was collected from 2086 attendees enrolled in 
the SLC to determine health changes and outcomes of student-delivered services. 
A series of health data was routinely collected at all contact points. This 
included physical health care, behavioural health risk, and chronic disease 
measures. All data was recorded in an electronic monitoring system. Population 
data identified some significant and positive changes to health 
patterns-smoking, waist size, and body mass index. Unfortunately, gaps in data 
entry precluded more robust findings. It was clear that this community suffered 
from experiences commonly associated with health disparity and poverty. There 
were higher risks of drinking alcohol and smoking with raised levels of 
lifestyle disease including diabetes. Some of these issues were mitigated by the 
community being able to attend a locally situated community driven clinic.

Wilson's disease (WD) is a relatively rare autosomal recessive inherited 
disorder causing copper accumulation in different organs, mainly the liver and 
brain. Psychiatric disturbances represent a diagnostic and therapeutic issue in 
WD. A search for relevant articles was carried out on PubMed/Medline, Scopus, 
and Google Scholar, for papers focused on psychiatric disorders in WD published 
between 1985-2016. Ninety-two articles were included in this review, showing the 
findings from 35 observational and case-control studies and 57 case reports. 
This study discussed the findings on the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in 
WD, their impact on the life of those diagnosed, and the efficacy of available 
treatments on the psychiatric outcomes of WD. Psychiatric disorders are 
confirmed frequent in WD, with a high prevalence of mood disorders, and 
contribute to worse Quality-of-Life and psychosocial outcomes. Because specific 
therapies for WD lead to a good life expectancy, adherence to medicaments and 
clinical monitoring should be warranted by a multidisciplinary approach, 
including a hepathologic, neurologic, and psychiatric careful evaluation and 
education of those affected and their relatives.

BACKGROUND: The Obsessive-Compulsive Treatment Efficacy randomised controlled 
Trial emerged from a research recommendation in National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) guidelines, which 
specified the need to evaluate cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment 
intensity formats.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
two low-intensity CBT interventions [supported computerised 
cognitive-behavioural therapy (cCBT) and guided self-help]: (1) compared with 
waiting list for high-intensity CBT in adults with OCD at 3 months; and (2) plus 
high-intensity CBT compared with waiting list plus high-intensity CBT in adults 
with OCD at 12 months. To determine patient and professional acceptability of 
low-intensity CBT interventions.
DESIGN: A three-arm, multicentre, randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services and 
primary/secondary care mental health services in 15 NHS trusts.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria for OCD, on a waiting list for 
high-intensity CBT and scoring ≥ 16 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 
(indicative of at least moderate severity OCD) and able to read English.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to (1) supported cCBT, (2) guided 
self-help or (3) a waiting list for high-intensity CBT.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was OCD symptoms using the Yale-Brown 
Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Observer Rated.
RESULTS: Patients were recruited from 14 NHS trusts between February 2011 and 
May 2014. Follow-up data collection was complete by May 2015. There were 475 
patients randomised: supported cCBT (n = 158); guided self-help (n = 158) and 
waiting list for high-intensity CBT (n = 159). Two patients were excluded post 
randomisation (one supported cCBT and one waiting list for high-intensity CBT); 
therefore, data were analysed for 473 patients. In the short term, prior to 
accessing high-intensity CBT, guided self-help demonstrated statistically 
significant benefits over waiting list, but these benefits did not meet the 
prespecified criterion for clinical significance [adjusted mean difference 
-1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.27 to -0.55; p = 0.006]. Supported cCBT 
did not demonstrate any significant benefit (adjusted mean difference -0.71, 95% 
CI -2.12 to 0.70). In the longer term, access to guided self-help and supported 
cCBT, prior to high-intensity CBT, did not lead to differences in outcomes 
compared with access to high-intensity CBT alone. Access to guided self-help and 
supported cCBT led to significant reductions in the uptake of high-intensity 
CBT; this did not seem to compromise patient outcomes at 12 months. Taking a 
decision-making approach, which focuses on which decision has a higher 
probability of being cost-effective, rather than the statistical significance of 
the results, there was little evidence that supported cCBT and guided self-help 
are cost-effective at the 3-month follow-up compared with a waiting list. 
However, by the 12-month follow-up, data suggested a greater probability of 
guided self-help being cost-effective than a waiting list from the health- and 
social-care perspective (60%) and the societal perspective (80%), and of 
supported cCBT being cost-effective compared with a waiting list from both 
perspectives (70%). Qualitative interviews found that guided self-help was more 
acceptable to patients than supported cCBT. Professionals acknowledged the 
advantages of low intensity interventions at a population level. No adverse 
events occurred during the trial that were deemed to be suspected or unexpected 
serious events.
LIMITATIONS: A significant issue in the interpretation of the results concerns 
the high level of access to high-intensity CBT during the waiting list period.
CONCLUSIONS: Although low-intensity interventions are not associated with 
clinically significant improvements in OCD symptoms, economic analysis over 12 
months suggests that low-intensity interventions are cost-effective and may have 
an important role in OCD care pathways. Further research to enhance the clinical 
effectiveness of these interventions may be warranted, alongside research on how 
best to incorporate them into care pathways.

BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic neuropsychiatric 
disorder with a 2% to 3% lifetime prevalence; in addition, 10% of OCD patients 
are resistant to conventional therapy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been an 
effective treatment for treatment resistant OCD patients (TROCD). We aimed to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of DBS for TROCD.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DBS 
compared to conventional treatment for TROCD with a 10-year time horizon. 
Published data were used to estimate the rates of treatment response and 
complications. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the third-party 
payer. Data on quality of life were obtained from a literature review and a 
survey of OCD patients. We applied the model separately to Korea and the United 
Kingdom (UK) to enhance the validity.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
US$37,865 per quality-adjusted life-year in Korea and US$34,462 per 
quality-adjusted life-year in the UK. According to the World Health 
Organization's criteria, DBS for TROCD was "cost-effective" in Korea (<3x GDP 
per capita) and "highly cost-effective" in the UK (<GDP per capita). One-way 
sensitivity analysis showed consistent cost-effectiveness results for most 
variables with the exception of short-term duration of treatment effect (<4 
years in Korea; <3 years in the UK).
CONCLUSION: The results showed that DBS is a cost-effective treatment for TROCD 
in both the countries. Our findings provide economic evidence on the 
applicability of DBS for patients, health care service providers, and payers.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of 30-month vs 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy 
with clopidogrel and aspirin after drug-eluting stents in patients with acute

Continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) beyond 1 year reduces late 
stent thrombosis and ischemic events after drug-eluting stents (DES) but 
increases risk of bleeding. We hypothesized that extending DAPT from 12 months 
to 30 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after DES is 
cost-effective. A lifelong decision-analytic model was designed to simulate 2 
antiplatelet strategies in event-free ACS patients who had completed 12-month 
DAPT after DES: aspirin monotherapy (75-162 mg daily) and continuation of DAPT
