OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer 
from the patient and societal perspectives.
METHOD: A partially observable Markov decision process model was used to 
optimize PSA screening decisions. Age-specific prostate cancer incidence rates 
and the mortality rates from prostate cancer and competing causes were 
considered. The model trades off the potential benefit of early detection with 
the cost of screening and loss of patient quality of life due to screening and 
treatment. PSA testing and biopsy decisions are made based on the patient's 
probability of having prostate cancer. Probabilities are inferred based on the 
patient's complete PSA history using Bayesian updating.
DATA SOURCES: The results of all PSA tests and biopsies done in Olmsted County, 
Minnesota, from 1993 to 2005 (11,872 men and 50,589 PSA test results).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' perspective: to maximize expected quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs); societal perspective: to maximize the expected monetary 
value based on societal willingness to pay for QALYs and the cost of PSA 
testing, prostate biopsies, and treatment.
RESULTS: From the patient perspective, the optimal policy recommends stopping 
PSA testing and biopsy at age 76. From the societal perspective, the stopping 
age is 71. The expected incremental benefit of optimal screening over the 
traditional guideline of annual PSA screening with threshold 4.0 ng/mL for 
biopsy is estimated to be 0.165 QALYs per person from the patient perspective 
and 0.161 QALYs per person from the societal perspective. PSA screening based on 
traditional guidelines is found to be worse than no screening at all.
CONCLUSIONS: PSA testing done with traditional guidelines underperforms and 
therefore underestimates the potential benefit of screening. Optimal screening 
guidelines differ significantly depending on the perspective of the decision 
maker.

CONTEXT: Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in developed 
countries, but the association between gestational age at birth and mortality in 
adulthood remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between gestational age at birth and 
mortality in young adulthood.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: National cohort study of 674,820 individuals 
born as singletons in Sweden in 1973 through 1979 who survived to age 1 year, 
including 27,979 born preterm (gestational age <37 weeks), followed up to 2008 
(ages 29-36 years).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause and cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 7095 deaths occurred in 20.8 million person-years of 
follow-up. Among individuals still alive at the beginning of each age range, a 
strong inverse association was found between gestational age at birth and 
mortality in early childhood (ages 1-5 years: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for 
each additional week of gestation, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94; P < .001), which 
disappeared in late childhood (ages 6-12 years: aHR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03; P 
= .61) and adolescence (ages 13-17 years: aHR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.03; P = .64) 
and then reappeared in young adulthood (ages 18-36 years: aHR, 0.96; 95% CI, 
0.94-0.97; P < .001). In young adulthood, mortality rates (per 1000 
person-years) by gestational age at birth were 0.94 for 22 to 27 weeks, 0.86 for 
28 to 33 weeks, 0.65 for 34 to 36 weeks, 0.46 for 37 to 42 weeks (full-term), 
and 0.54 for 43 or more weeks. Preterm birth was associated with increased 
mortality in young adulthood even among individuals born late preterm (34-36 
weeks, aHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13-1.50; P < .001), relative to those born 
full-term. In young adulthood, gestational age at birth had the strongest 
inverse association with mortality from congenital anomalies and respiratory, 
endocrine, and cardiovascular disorders and was not associated with mortality 
from neurological disorders, cancer, or injury.
CONCLUSION: After excluding earlier deaths, low gestational age at birth was 
independently associated with increased mortality in early childhood and young 
adulthood.

prospective study.

BACKGROUND: The burden of anogenital warts will be a determining factor when 
making decisions about the type of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to be used 
(bivalent or quadrivalent) and whether to vaccinate males. We conducted a 
multicenter prospective study to (1) describe the impact of anogenital warts on 
quality of life and (2) estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost 
due to anogenital warts.
METHODS: Between September 2006 and February 2008, 272 patients with a first or 
recurrent episode of anogenital warts were recruited from the clinical practices 
of 42 physicians across Canada. Quality of life was measured at recruitment, and 
2 and 6 months later with the EuroQol, Short Form-12, short Spielberg 
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and HPV impact profile. The duration of an 
episode and QALYs lost due to anogenital warts were estimated among 51 incident 
cases recruited within 90 days of disease onset.
RESULTS: Anogenital warts had a significant impact on the quality of life. This 
negative impact was similar for first and recurrent episodes, and lasted as long 
as lesions persisted. Anogenital warts had the greatest negative impact on usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, and on self-image, sexual 
activity, and partner issues and possible transmission. The median duration of a 
first anogenital wart episode amongst incident cases was 125 days and resulted 
in QALYs lost of 0.017 to 0.041, which is equivalent to 6 to 15 days of healthy 
life lost.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of anogenital warts is substantial and should be 
considered by physicians and public health officials when making recommendations 
about HPV vaccination..

Bernard Hirsch, BP 50105, 95021 Cergy-Pontoise Cedex, France. chevalier@essec.fr

OBJECTIVES: While a French language version of the EQ-5D exists, to date, there 
has been no French value set to accompany it. The objective of our study was 
then to derive the French TTO value set of the EQ-5D.
METHODS: A total of 452 respondents aged over 18 were recruited who were 
representative of the French population with regard to age, gender, and 
socio-professional group. The direct valuation of 24 health states was first 
obtained by Time Trade-Off (TTO), and the negative TTO values were bounded using 
the monotonic transformation. Several alternative model specifications were 
investigated to estimate the values for all 243 states in the EQ-5D descriptive 
system. Only the best fitting model is presented in this paper. The analysis was 
conducted at an individual level to make the maximum use of the available data, 
and we estimated mixed models with random intercept. Models were compared 
through the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the mean absolute error (MAE), 
and the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and the predicted 
values of each model.
RESULTS: After exclusion, 443 respondents took part in the study. The best 
fitting model included the same variables as the N3-model used in UK.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the French value set of the EQ-5D based on the 
stated preferences of the French general public facilitating cost-effectiveness 
analysis.

BACKGROUND: Although breast cancer screening with mammography and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for breast cancer-susceptibility gene 
(BRCA) mutation carriers, there is no current consensus on the optimal screening 
regimen.
METHODS: The authors used a computer simulation model to compare 6 annual 
screening strategies (film mammography [FM], digital mammography [DM], FM and 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or DM and MRI contemporaneously, and 
alternating FM/MRI or DM/MRI at 6-month intervals) beginning at ages 25 years, 
30 years, 35 years, and 40 years, and 2 strategies of annual MRI with delayed 
alternating DM/FM versus clinical surveillance alone. Strategies were evaluated 
without and with mammography-induced breast cancer risk using 2 models of excess 
relative risk. Input parameters were obtained from the medical literature, 
publicly available databases, and calibration.
RESULTS: Without radiation risk effects, alternating DM/MRI starting at age 25 
years provided the highest life expectancy (BRCA1, 72.52 years, BRCA2, 77.63 
years). When radiation risk was included, a small proportion of diagnosed 
cancers was attributable to radiation exposure (BRCA1, <2%; BRCA2, <4%). With 
radiation risk, alternating DM/MRI at age 25 years or annual MRI at age 25 
years/delayed alternating DM at age 30 years was the most effective, depending 
on the radiation risk model used. Alternating DM/MRI starting at age 25 years 
also produced the highest number of false-positive screens per woman (BRCA1, 4.5 
BRCA2, 8.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Annual MRI at age 25 years/delayed alternating DM at age 30 years 
is probably the most effective screening strategy in BRCA mutation carriers. 
Screening benefits, associated risks, and personal acceptance of false-positive 
results should be considered in choosing the optimal screening strategy for 
individual women.

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is efficacious in reducing drug use that 
may improve HIV/AIDS care and treatment outcomes. This study evaluated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of MMT for HIV-positive drug users from the 
perspective of health service providers. A sample of 370 HIV-positive drug users 
(age: mean ± SD: 29.5 ± 5.9 years; 95.7% male) taking MMT in multi-sites was 
assessed at baseline, three, six and nine months. Costs of MMT services were 
analyzed and converted to the year 2009. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
were modeled from changes in health-related quality of life of patients using 
the modified World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief Version 
(WHOQOL-BREF). Inverse probability-of-treatment weights, constructed using 
propensity score of non-responses, were applied to adjust for potential 
confounding. Over nine months, MMT substantially improved QALYs of HIV/AIDS 
patients (0.076 QALY [0.066-0.084]). The increments in QALY were large and 
stabilized in those patients taking antiretroviral treatment and abstinent to 
drug use. For one QALY gained, the MMT program would cost US$3745.3, 
approximately 3.2 times Vietnam GDP per capita in 2009. The cost-effectiveness 
of MMT intervention was robust against HIV advanced status or co-morbidity, 
e.g., TB treatment, but it might not be cost-effective for those patients who 
continued to use drug. Findings of this study indicate that providing MMT for 
HIV-positive drug users is a cost-effective intervention in Vietnam. Integrating 
MMT to HIV/AIDS care and treatment services would be beneficial in 
injection-driven HIV epidemics.

Aging of biological systems is a fundamental process controlled by a complex 
network of molecular pathways. In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, a 
model in which organismal aging can conveniently be analysed, mitochondria play 
a central role. A wide range of relevant pathways were identified that 
contribute to the maintenance of a population of functional mitochondria. These 
pathways act in a hierarchical manner, but all the pathways are limited in 
capacity. At the end of the life cycle, when the various surveillance pathways 
are overwhelmed and damage has passed certain thresholds, programmed cell death 
brings the life of individual P. anserina to an end.

OBJECTIVES: Recent introduction of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccine for girls in New Zealand is expected to decrease the incidence of HPV 
infection as well as resultant cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer. 
This may affect the cost-effectiveness of the national cervical screening 
program by reducing the incidence of lesions detected. This study investigates 
the cost-effectiveness of the current cervical screening policy with and without 
the HPV vaccine and compares these results with the cost-effectiveness of a 
range of other screening strategies.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was built based on the natural history 
of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. The model followed a hypothetical cohort of 
girls from 12 years to 85 years of age or death, through screening and treatment 
pathways. The model compared a "no vaccine and current screening" strategy with 
a selection of screening strategies with different age ranges and frequency 
intervals.
RESULTS: The most cost-effective cervical screening strategy in the presence of 
the HPV vaccine would be screening women aged 30-60 every 5 years. Moving to 
this screening strategy from the base case of no vaccine and the current New 
Zealand strategy of screening women aged 20-69 every 3 years is predicted to 
have an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of NZ$9,841 
(€4,428).
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing screening intensity from 3 to 5 years as well as narrowing 
the screening age range for the vaccinated cohort once they reach mid-twenties 
is recommended. The importance of achieving a high vaccine uptake in New Zealand 
remains high.

Toxicity of aluminium in natural waters controlled by type rather than quantity 
of natural organic matter.

Author information:

Extension of the conditions under which Al toxicity is tested is required. 
Environmentally representative preparation of waters is used in investigating 
roles of alginate (AA) and humic acids (HA) in partitioning of Al (0.5 mg 
L(-1)), subsequent uptake and accumulation by and toxicity to Lymnaea stagnalis. 
HA and AA did not alter precipitation of Al(OH)3, but altered subsequent 
behaviour of Al. High (40 mg L(-1)) HA concentrations, and to a lesser extent 
AA, prevented settling and availability for benthic grazing but made deposited 
Al more likely to be ingested. HA detoxified but AA increased toxicity relative 
to Al alone. Low concentration (4 mg L(-1)) AA and HA do not change partitioning 
but increase uptake; they both detoxify, but AA less than HA. The study shows 
OC:Al ratio is critical in predicting Al behaviour in natural waters, also 
uptake is mediated by snail behaviour, not solely a function of concentration 
and form of Al. Therefore, predicting Al behaviour will be subject to errors in 
determining relevant water composition and response of biota to the new 
speciation. However, with respect to toxicity, rather than other aspects of Al 
behaviour, different ratios of HA and Al are insignificant compared to whether 
AA is present rather than HA.

The population of above 65 years of age is increasing fast in societies, as the 
life expectancy is increasing and it leads to high demands for health care 
service. Health care service for the elderly should be provided by trained team 
in this field. Success of health care service to be rendered is related to 
knowledge, skill and attitudes of team members in different profession group 
(doctor, nurse, social worker, psychologist, etc.) about health of elderly. The 
aim of this study is to establish the Turkish validity and reliability of 
14-question UCLA-GA scale, validity and reliability of which was proven and used 
the most frequently among the scales that assess attitudes of health care 
providers toward elderly. A total 256 people, 150 of them were post-graduates, 
106 of them were pre-graduates were involved in the study at Ege University, 
medical faculty between the dates of December 2010 and February 2011. Majority 
of the participants (63.67%) were women and in the age group of 18-29 (58.3%). 
The ratio of the ones undergoing geriatric education is 38.2%. It was found out 
that the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sampling adequacy test presented high 
correlation among the items in both single adult households of 14 items of the 
scale was 0.72. Cronbach alpha value of the scale was found as 0.67 and 
satisfying. As a result of examination with Tukey's test of additivity, it was 
seen that items of the scale have additive quality (F=85.25, p<0.0001). When we 
calculated the correlation of each item with total score, it was found that 
correlation coefficient varied between 0.32 and 0.68. Test-retest reliability 
was defined by use of Pearson correlation analysis. It was determined that 
test-retest consistency of correlation scale between two measurements was 
r=0.51. As a result of test-retest application, the correlation between the 
first and second application scores of each item was analyzed to determine the 
internal consistency of each item of the scale. Based on this analysis it was 
found as p<0.01 between r=0.22 and 0.65. As a conclusion, Turkish validity and 
reliability of UCLA-GA scale was demonstrated in this study. Since Turkish 
version of UCLA-GA scale is short and clear, it is recommended to use it for 
determining attitudes of health care providers toward elderly in geriatrics.

Raltitrexed plus cisplatin is cost-effective compared with pemetrexed plus 
cisplatin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Woods B(1), Paracha N, Scott DA, Thatcher N.

Author information:
(1)Oxford Outcomes, Oxford, UK. beth.woods@oxfordoutcomes.com

INTRODUCTION: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 
has previously recommended pemetrexed plus cisplatin for the treatment of 
patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and WHO performance 
status 0-1. Subsequent to this appraisal, randomised controlled trial (RCT) data 
for raltitrexed plus cisplatin and comparing chemotherapy to active symptom 
control (ASC) has become available, allowing a more complete analysis of the 
comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of first-line chemotherapy in MPM.
METHODS: An adjusted indirect comparison is used to estimate the relative 
efficacy of raltitrexed plus cisplatin and pemetrexed plus cisplatin. A 
cost-effectiveness model is used to assess the lifetime costs and health 
outcomes associated with these comparators and ASC. Patient level data from the 
EORTC 08983 trial are used to estimate baseline progression and survival rates. 
Relative treatment effects are taken from RCTs; cost and utility data from the 
literature.
RESULTS: Raltitrexed plus cisplatin and pemetrexed plus cisplatin were not found 
to be statistically significantly different with respect to overall response, 
progression free survival or overall survival. The cost-effectiveness analysis 
found raltitrexed plus cisplatin to be cost-effective at a cost per quality 
adjusted life year of £13,454 compared to cisplatin and £27,360 compared to ASC. 
Pemetrexed plus cisplatin is dominated by raltitrexed plus cisplatin as the 
raltitrexed combination offers marginally higher quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and life years (LYs) at a substantially lower total cost.
CONCLUSION: Raltitrexed plus cisplatin is a cost-effective first-line treatment 
for MPM. This conclusion was maintained across a number of sensitivity analyses.

BACKGROUND: Russia's market reforms in the early 1990s led to marked social 
inequalities. We analysed inequalities in risks of dying for Russian men by 
occupational class and perceived social status in the post-transition era.
METHODS: Cox proportional analysis of the hazard of dying by occupational class, 
education, household income and perceived social status was performed for 593 
deaths that occurred between 1994 and 2006 using a representative sample of 
Russia's male population (n = 6586 people, 40 046 person-years). Occupational 
class was coded based on the European Socio-Economic Classification; social 
status was based on survey questionnaires about people's perceived economic, 
power and respect status.
RESULTS: Manual occupational class is significantly associated with greater 
hazards of dying among men, after adjusting for age, education and other 
potential confounding variables. Groups at highest risk were men who were manual 
workers, manual supervisors and technicians, and lower sales and service 
workers. Substantial gaps in life expectancy at age 21 of up to 10 years were 
observed between male managers and professionals and manual workers.
CONCLUSION: Substantial inequalities in risks of dying exist by both 
occupational class and perceived status in Russia, with patterns by class 
differing from those in the west.

conclusions generated from data from a prospective nonrandomized trial for 
treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
METHODS: Patients 40 to 85 years of age with degenerative cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy were enrolled from 7 sites over 2 years (2007-2009). Patients were 
treated with ventral or dorsal fusion surgery, and outcomes were measured to 1 
year postoperatively. A hospital-based cost analysis was performed using 
Medicare cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs) multiplied by hospital charges from the 
index hospitalization (CCR method). A society-based cost analysis was performed 
by estimating costs from the index hospitalization using Medicare coding 
reimbursement (the Medicare reimbursement method). A separate outpatient cost 
analysis was performed on a subset of 20 patients.
RESULTS: Of the 85 patients analyzed, 72 had 1-year follow-up. The CCR method 
showed a difference in upfront direct costs between the dorsal and ventral 
approaches ($27,942 ± 14,220 vs $21,563 ± 8721; P = .02). Overall upfront direct 
costs with the Medicare reimbursement method were not different. With the CCR 
method, the ventral approach dominates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
analysis. With the Medicare reimbursement method, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for ventral surgery is $34,533, the cost of 1 
additional quality-adjusted life-year gained by using ventral instead of dorsal 
surgery. In the subanalysis, outpatient costs were less after ventral surgery 
than dorsal surgery ($1997 ± 1211 vs $4734 ± $2874; P = .006).
CONCLUSION: The choice of cost methodology may substantially influence the final 
results of an economic study.

A symposium in January 2011 "The Paleocardiology of Ancient Egypt" reviewed old 
and new evidence for the presence of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in ancient 
Egyptian mummies. This symposium was dedicated as a Centenary for the pioneering 
report of Marc Ruffer in 1911 (Ruffer, 1911). Based on CT scans, the Horus Study 
team concluded that atherosclerosis was present in the ancient Egyptian elites 
and is not a disease new to the 20th Century. Presentations included 
radiological data on vasculature, skeleton, and teeth, indicating degenerative 
diseases and poor health before age 50 in these specimens. Comparisons were made 
with the Bolivian Tsimane, a 20th Century population living without access to 
modern medicine with short life expectancy. Further research is needed to 
develop an epidemiological context for estimating population level prevalence of 
vascular disease and its risk factors in ancient Egyptian societies.

OBJECTIVES: The United States has the highest prevalence of obesity and one of 
the lowest life expectancies among high-income countries. We investigated the 
relationship between these 2 phenomena.
METHODS: We estimated the fraction of deaths attributable to obesity by country, 
age, and sex and reestimated life tables after removing these deaths. To allow 
for a possible secular decline in obesity risks, we employed alternative risks 
from a more recent period.
RESULTS: In our baseline analysis, obesity reduced US life expectancy at age 50 
years in 2006 by 1.54 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37, 1.93) for 
women and by 1.85 years (95% CI = 1.62, 2.10) for men. Removing the effects of 
obesity reduced the US shortfall by 42% (95% CI = 36, 48) for women and 67% (95% 
CI = 57, 76) for men, relative to countries with higher life expectancies. Using 
more recently recorded risk data, we estimated that differences in obesity still 
accounted for a fifth to a third of the shortfall.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of obesity in the United States contributes 
substantially to its poor international ranking in longevity.

Water- and wastewater-related disease and infection risks: what is an 
appropriate value for the maximum tolerable additional burden of disease?

The maximum additional burden of water- and wastewater-related disease of 10-6 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) loss per person per year (pppy), used in 
the WHO Drinking-water Quality Guidelines and the WHO Guidelines for Wastewater 
Use in Agriculture, is based on US EPA'S acceptance of a 70-year lifetime 
waterborne cancer risk of 10(-5) per person, equivalent to an annual risk of 
1.4x10(-7) per person which is four orders of magnitude lower than the actual 
all-cancer incidence in the USA in 2009 of 1.8x10(-3) pppy. A maximum additional 
burden of 10(-4) DALY loss pppy would reduce this risk to a more cost-effective, 
but still low, risk of 1.4x10(-5) pppy. It would increase the DALY loss pppy in 
low- and middle-income countries due to diarrhoeal diseases from the current 
level of 0.0119 pppy to 0.0120 pppy, and that due to ascariasis from 0.0026 pppy 
to 0.0027 pppy, but neither increase is of public-health significance. It is 
therefore recommended that the maximum additional burden of disease from these 
activities be increased to a DALY loss of 10(-4) pppy as this provides an 
adequate margin of public-health safety in relation to waterborne-cancer deaths, 
diarrhoeal disease and ascariasis in all countries.

The development of memory efficiency and value-directed remembering across the 
life span: a cross-sectional study of memory and selectivity.

Although attentional control and memory change considerably across the life 
span, no research has examined how the ability to strategically remember 
important information (i.e., value-directed remembering) changes from childhood 
to old age. The present study examined this in different age groups across the 
life span (N = 320, 5-96 years old). A selectivity task was used in which 
participants were asked to study and recall items worth different point values 
in order to maximize their point score. This procedure allowed for measures of 
memory quantity/capacity (number of words recalled) and memory 
efficiency/selectivity (the recall of high-value items relative to low-value 
items). Age-related differences were found for memory capacity, as young adults 
recalled more words than the other groups. However, in terms of selectivity, 
younger and older adults were more selective than adolescents and children. The 
dissociation between these measures across the life span illustrates important 
age-related differences in terms of memory capacity and the ability to 
selectively remember high-value information.

[Diagnosis and options for reconstructive heart valve surgery in the Marfan 
syndrome].

[Article in Russian]

Bernhardt A, Treede H, Rybczynski M, Sheikzadeh S, Meinertz T, Reichenspurner H, 
Kodolitsch Y.

Marfan syndrome is a disorder of the connective tissue that is inherited in an 
autosomal-dominant fashion and that is caused by mutations in the gene coding 
for fibrillin-1, FBN1. Although complications of the syndrome may involve the 
eye, the lung and the skeleton, the high mortality of untreated cases results 
almost exclusively from cardiovascular complications, including aortic 
dissection, rupture and mitral valve regurgitation. The multiorgan involvement 
of many of these syndromes requires multidisciplinary expert centers that can 
increase the average life expectancy of affected patients from only 32 years to 
over 60 years. The present article both reviews classical standards of managing 
cardiovascular manifestations and highlights the surgical approach for aortic 
and mitral valve surgery in Marfan patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Only a small proportion of patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a life expectancy greater than 2 years. 
The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with long-term 
survival of patients with advanced NSCLC.
METHODS: Patients who had received chemotherapy for stage IIIb or IV NSCLC that 
was not amenable to radiotherapy were studied retrospectively. Data were 
gathered prospectively from a comprehensive database. Long-term survivors (>2 
years) were compared with the other patients, with respect to clinical, 
biological and tumour-node-metastasis criteria.
RESULTS: Data for 245 consecutive patients were collected. Thirty nine patients 
(15.9%) survived for more than 2 years. Long-term survivors were more likely to 
have had metastases at fewer sites (P = 0.008), an absence of bone metastases 
(P = 0.01), a performance status (PS) of 0-1 at first progression of the tumour 
(P = 0.002), a tumour that was controlled with first (P < 0.0001) and 
second-line (P = 0.004) chemotherapy, maintenance therapy (P = 0.001), curative 
surgery (P < 0.0001), time to first progression of the tumour of >3 months 
(P < 0.0001), normal LDH levels at diagnosis (P = 0.049), and a haemoglobin 
concentration >110 g/L at first progression of the tumour (P = 0.02). In 
multivariate analysis, surgery, maintenance treatment, time to first progression 
of the tumour of >3 months, a PS of 0-1 at first progression, the number of 
chemotherapy agents received, and LDH levels, were significant predictors of 
long-term survival.
CONCLUSIONS:   Assessment of these factors, and the use of maintenance therapy, 
when possible, may identify a population of patients with NSCLC that is likely 
to have a prolonged life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity has major impacts on health and productivity. 
Our aim was to estimate the health and economic benefits of reducing the 
prevalence of physical inactivity in the 2008 Australian adult population. The 
economic benefits were estimated as 'opportunity cost savings', which represent 
resources utilized in the treatment of preventable disease that are potentially 
available for re-direction to another purpose from fewer incident cases of 
disease occurring in communities.
METHODS: Simulation models were developed to show the effect of a 10% feasible, 
reduction target for physical inactivity from current Australian levels (70%). 
Lifetime cohort health benefits were estimated as fewer incident cases of 
inactivity-related diseases; deaths; and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) 
by age and sex. Opportunity costs were estimated as health sector cost impacts, 
as well as paid and unpaid production gains and leisure impacts from fewer 
disease events associated with reduced physical inactivity. Workforce production 
gains were estimated by comparing surveyed participation and absenteeism rates 
of physically active and inactive adults, and valued using the friction cost 
approach. The impact of an improvement in health status on unpaid household 
production and leisure time were modeled from time use survey data, as applied 
to the exposed and non-exposed population subgroups and valued by suitable 
proxy. Potential costs associated with interventions to increase physical 
activity were not included. Multivariable uncertainty analyses and univariate 
sensitivity analyses were undertaken to provide information on the strength of 
the conclusions.
RESULTS: A 10% reduction in physical inactivity would result in 6,000 fewer 
incident cases of disease, 2,000 fewer deaths, 25,000 fewer DALYs and provide 
gains in working days (114,000), days of home-based production (180,000) while 
conferring a AUD96 million reduction in health sector costs. Lifetime potential 
opportunity cost savings in workforce production (AUD12 million), home-based 
production (AUD71 million) and leisure-based production (AUD79 million) was 
estimated (total AUD162 million 95% uncertainty interval AUD136 million, AUD196 
million).
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunity cost savings and health benefits conservatively 
estimated from a reduction in population-level physical inactivity may be 
substantial. The largest savings will benefit individuals in the form of unpaid 
production and leisure gains, followed by the health sector, business and 
government.

Is Drotrecogin alfa (activated) for adults with severe sepsis, cost-effective in 
routine clinical practice?

INTRODUCTION: Previous cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) reported that 
Drotrecogin alfa (DrotAA) is cost-effective based on a Phase III clinical trial 
(PROWESS). There is little evidence on whether DrotAA is cost-effective in 
routine clinical practice. We assessed whether DrotAA is cost-effective in 
routine practice for adult patients with severe sepsis and multiple organ 
systems failing.
METHODS: This CEA used data from a prospective cohort study that compared DrotAA 
versus no DrotAA (control) for severe sepsis patients with multiple organ 
systems failing admitted to critical care units in England, Wales, and Northern 
Ireland. The cohort study used case-mix and mortality data from a national 
audit, linked with a separate audit of DrotAA infusions. Re-admissions to 
critical care and corresponding mortality were recorded for four years. Patients 
receiving DrotAA (n = 1,076) were matched to controls (n = 1,650) with a 
propensity score (Pscore), and Genetic Matching (GenMatch). The CEA projected 
long-term survival to report lifetime incremental costs per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) overall, and for subgroups with two or three to five organ 
systems failing at baseline.
RESULTS: The incremental costs per QALY for DrotAA were £30,000 overall, and 
£16,000 for the subgroups with three to five organ systems failing. For patients 
with two organ systems failing, DrotAA resulted in an average loss of one QALY 
at an incremental cost of £15,000. When the subgroup with two organ systems was 
restricted to patients receiving DrotAA within 24 hours, DrotAA led to a gain of 
1.2 QALYs at a cost per QALY of £11,000. The results were robust to other 
assumptions including the approach taken to projecting long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: DrotAA is cost-effective in routine practice for severe sepsis 
patients with three to five organ systems failing. For patients with two organ 
systems failing, this study could not provide unequivocal evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness of DrotAA.

Patient and provider determinants of nephrology referral in older adults with 
severe chronic kidney disease: a survey of provider decision making.

BACKGROUND: Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affects 
older adults, they are less likely to be referred to a nephrologist. Factors 
that influence the referral decisions of primary care providers (PCPs) 
specifically for older CKD patients have been incompletely described. Patient 
factors such as dementia, functional disability, and co-morbidity may complicate 
the decision to refer an older adult. This study evaluated the role of patient 
and PCP factors in the referral decisions for older adults with stage 4 CKD.
METHODS: We administered a two-part survey to study the decisions of practicing 
PCPs. First, using a blocked factorial design, vignettes systematically varied 6 
patient characteristics: age, race, gender, co-morbidity, functional status, and 
cognitive status. CKD severity, patient preferences, and degree of anemia were 
held constant. Second, covariates from a standard questionnaire included PCP 
estimates of life expectancy, demographics, reaction to clinical uncertainty, 
and risk aversion. The main outcome was the decision to refer to the 
nephrologist. Random effects logistic regression models tested independent 
associations of predictor variables with the referral decision.
RESULTS: More than half (62.5%) of all PCP decisions (n = 680) were to refer to 
a nephrologist. Vignette-based factors that independently decreased referral 
included older patient age (OR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.48) and having moderate 
dementia (OR = 0.14; 95%CI, 0.07 to 0.25). There were no associations between 
co-morbidity or impaired functional activity with the referral decision. 
Survey-based PCP factors that significantly increased the referral likelihood 
include female gender (OR = 7.75; 95%CI, 2.07 to 28.93), non-white race (OR = 
30.29; 95%CI, 1.30 to 703.73), those who expect nephrologists to discuss goals 
of care (OR = 53.13; 95%CI, 2.42 to 1168.00), those with higher levels of 
anxiety about uncertainty (OR = 1.28; 95%CI, 1.04 to 1.57), and those with 
greater risk aversion (OR = 3.39; 95%CI, 1.02 to 11.24).
CONCLUSIONS: In this decision making study using hypothetical clinical 
vignettes, we found that the PCP decision to refer older patients with severe 
CKD to a nephrologist reflects a complex interplay between patient and provider 
factors. Age, dementia, and several provider characteristics weighed more 
heavily than co-morbidity and functional status in PCP referral decisions. These 
results suggest that practice guidelines should develop a more nuanced approach 
to the referral of older adults with CKD.

Life expectancy has greatly increased in the last century. In the last decades, 
cancer in the older people has become an increasingly common problem owing to 
the prolonged life-expectancy of the general population and to the improved 
management of common cancers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the 
age-specific incidence ratios in patients with LC. Data were collected from 
hospital-based registries from 1988 to 2007. A total of 10,881 patients were 
assessed. The median age at diagnosis was 60 years. When compared to 
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, these values were found 
to be 10 years younger than American patients. Trends consist of the median ages 
of patients were increased during years (p<0.001). Along the years, especially 
in the last years, the ratios of cancer patients of older than 70 years were 
significantly increased among the cancer patient populations. In conclusion, LC 
in older person has become an increasingly common problem in the last years.

INTRODUCTION: Anastomotic pseudoaneurysms and true para-anastomotic aneurysms 
after initial open abdominal aortic prosthetic reconstruction often need 
reintervention because they are at risk for rupture. However, open surgical 
reinterventions are technically challenging procedures with high mortality and 
morbidity rates. In the present multicenter study, we describe the long-term 
clinical course in an expanded number of patients who underwent endovascular 
repair of para-anastomotic aneurysms after previous open reconstruction.
METHODS: The study included all patients who were treated with an endovascular 
stent graft between July 1999 and July 2009 for an aortoiliac anastomotic 
pseudoaneurysm or a true para-anastomotic aneurysm after previous aortic 
prosthetic reconstruction for aneurysmal or occlusive disease in one of the four 
participating centers. Main outcomes were long-term complications, 
reinterventions and conversion rate, mortality, and hospital length of stay.
RESULTS: An endovascular stent graft was used to treat 58 patients (53 men; mean 
age, 71 ± 9 years), with 80 aortic or iliac pseudoaneurysms or true 
para-anastomotic aneurysm, or both. Bifurcated stent grafts were used in 32 
patients, endovascular tube grafts in eight, aortouniiliac stent grafts in 
seven, and iliac extension grafts in 11. Stent graft deployment was successful 
in 55 patients, for a technical success rate of 95%. Median hospital admission 
was 3 days (range, 1-122 days). The 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were 
3.4% (n = 2) and 6.9% (n = 4), respectively. The 30-day clinical success rate 
was 91% (n = 53). Median follow-up was 41 months (range, 0-106 months). The 
cumulative and procedural-related mortality during follow-up was 19% (n = 11) 
and 10% (n = 6), respectively. Follow-up computed tomography angiography 
revealed nine endoleaks (three type I; six type II) in eight patients and 
endotension in two patients. The overall reintervention and conversion rate 
during follow-up was 26.9% (n = 15) and 6.9% (n = 4), respectively. Life-table
