Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a recognised as the economic evaluation technique 
that accords most with the underlying principles of standard welfare economic 
theory. However, due to problems associated with the technique, economists 
evaluating resources allocation decisions in health care have most often used 
cost-effective analysis (CEA), in which health benefits are expressed in 
non-monetary units. As a result, attempts have been made to build a welfare 
economic bridge between cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA). In this paper, we develops these attempts and finds that, while 
assumptions can be made to facilitate a constant willingness-to-pay per unit of 
health outcome, these restrictions are highly unrealistic. We develop an 
impossibility theorem that shows it is not possible to link CBA and CEA if: (i) 
the axioms of expected utility theory hold; (ii) the quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) model is valid in a welfare economic sense; and (iii) illness affects the 
ability to enjoy consumption. We conclude that, within a welfare economic 
framework, it would be unwise to rely on a link between CBA and CEA in economic 
evaluations.

Rational eating: can it lead to overweightness or underweightness?

Although a deviation from the physiologically optimal weight increases the 
probability of dying, the steady state for an expected lifetime-utility 
maximiser is a state of overweightness. However, even a small initial deviation 
from this rationally stationary weight is followed by explosive oscillations. 
These oscillations might lead to severe and chronic underweightness in a late 
stage of life. In the presence of socio-cultural norms of appearance, the 
rationally stationary weight of fat people is lower than otherwise and the 
rationally stationary weight of lean people is greater than otherwise.

With limited data available on the optimal treatment of primary HIV infection, 
disease modeling can be used to project clinical outcomes and inform decision 
makers. The authors developed a simulation model to evaluate the clinical 
outcomes and life expectancy projections for three primary HIV infection 
treatment strategies: 1) continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated at 
CD4 count <350 cells/mm(3); 2) continuous ART initiated immediately on diagnosis 
of primary HIV infection; and 3) ART initiated on diagnosis followed by 
structured treatment interruption. Projected life expectancies for the three 
strategies were 23.92, 24.46, and 26.07 years, respectively. The impact of key 
variables was assessed in sensitivity analysis, with the structured treatment 
interruption strategy remaining the most effective over a broad range of inputs. 
The immunologic benefit associated with immediate therapy and the potential for 
antiretroviral resistance due to structured treatment interruption have the most 
important impact on the optimal strategy. Based on current data, immediate 
treatment on diagnosis of primary HIV infection followed by structured treatment 
interruption will likely yield the best outcome. These results can assist 
decision makers and those planning clinical trials in defining evidence-based 
performance measures for primary HIV infection treatment and future trials.

52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.

This article gives an overview about current thinking in pathogenesis and 
natural course /therapy in chronic pancreatitis. Alcohol consumption is still 
the most relevant factor in the development of chronic pancreatitis, a disease 
with enormous personal and social impact, shortening life expectancy up to 10-20 
yrs. Pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis has to be considered for different 
symptoms. Particularly pain, the most bothering symptom, is most likely due to a 
combination of hypertension in the organ and parenchymal alterations. 
Pathogenesis of pancreatic head enlargement remains largely elusive. In 
particular it is not known what triggers growth factors to step into action. 
Most other symptoms like common bile duct stenosis or portal hypertension are 
secondary to this enlargement of the head of the pancreas.

Cancer Cener and Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Georgia, USA.

PURPOSE: We have previously reported that patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma and a normal platelet count of 400,000/mm. have a 64% increase in life 
expectancy compared with those with thrombocytosis. We determined whether 
thrombocytosis was predictive of death from renal cell carcinoma after radical 
nephrectomy was performed with curative intent for early stage disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of 204 patients with renal cell 
carcinoma who underwent radical nephrectomy with curative intent between June 
1993 and January 2000 at Emory University Hospital. Survival, pathological grade 
and stage were recorded from the Emory Winship Cancer Institute tumor registry. 
Platelet counts were recorded and any patient with at least 1 platelet count of 
greater than 400,000/mm. was classified with thrombocytosis. Those with a 
platelet count of 400,000/mm. were classified with a normal platelet count.
RESULTS: There were 26 patients with thrombocytosis and 178 patients with 
persistently normal platelet counts. The overall and cancer specific death rate 
in the 26 patients with thrombocytosis was 50% and 42%, respectively. The 
overall mean time between nephrectomy and death was 12.1 months in this group. 
The overall and cancer specific death rate in the 178 patients with a normal 
platelet count was 15.2% and 7.3%, respectively. Mean time to death was 22.6 
months in this group. Differences in the overall and cancer specific death rates 
were highly statistically significant as well as clinically significant. These 
differences remained significant after controlling for grade, stage and 
histological type of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the association of thrombocytosis with 
decreased survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma. In those who undergo 
nephrectomy for early stage renal cell carcinoma with a perioperative platelet 
count of greater than 400,000/mm. the cancer specific death rate from renal cell 
carcinoma is greater than 5 times the rate in patients with a persistently 
normal platelet counts after radical nephrectomy. The platelet count appears to 
be a new and powerful independent prognosticator in patients with renal cell 
carcinoma who undergo radical nephrectomy for presumed localized disease.

Quality of life and Kaposi sarcoma: using preference techniques to value the 
health gains from treatment.

The goal of this work was to investigate preference techniques to value 
potential health gains from treatments of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). The study was 
designed to take the form of face-to-face interviews with a sample of men with a 
history of HIV/AIDS ( n=15) or HIV/AIDS and KS ( n=17). The main outcome measure 
was quality of life (QoL) associated with various KS disease states expressed on 
a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health), obtained though time trade-off 
(TTO) and rating scale techniques. For cutaneous lesions only, the mean TTO 
preference score value was 0.27. In other words, the men were willing to trade a 
life expectancy of 5 years for a shorter period (1.4 years) in perfect health. 
More severe KS health states were rated lower (0.07-0.09). The mean rating scale 
value for cutaneous lesions only was 0.11 and ranged from -0.10 to -0.04 for the 
more severe conditions; these values were systematically lower than the TTO ( 
P=0.014). A large overall potential gain in QoL from treatment (partial response 
minus stable disease) was found for each condition to be reflected in both the 
TTO (from 0.31 to 0.55) and the rating scale (from 0.38 to 0.44). Respondents 
associate KS health states with extremely poor QoL and indicate that large gains 
are possible through modest treatment effects. While TTO returns higher values 
than the rating scale, potential gains from treatments were similar. The 
techniques appear to be suitable for application to QoL and economic evaluation 
of treatments of KS.

BACKGROUND: Lung fibrosis can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension, limiting 
exercise tolerance and life expectancy. Furthermore, vasodilators might cause 
deterioration in gas exchange. Our aim was to compare acute effects of 
sildenafil, nitric oxide, and epoprostenol in individuals with pulmonary 
hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis.
METHODS: We did a randomised controlled, open-label trial, in 16 individuals 
admitted to our hospital with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis. 
After inhalation of nitric oxide (10-20 ppm), we assigned patients to either 
maximum tolerated dose of intravenous epoprostenol (mean 8.0 ng/kg per min; n=8) 
or oral sildenafil (50 mg; n=8). Our primary objective was to assess pulmonary 
vasodilative potency (decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance index) of 
sildenafil by comparison with inhaled nitric oxide and infused epoprostenol. 
Analyses were by intention to treat.
FINDINGS: Pulmonary vascular resistance index was reduced by nitric oxide 
(-21.9%, 95% CI -14.1 to -36.2), epoprostenol (-36.9%, -24.4 to -59.6), and 
sildenafil (-32.5%, -10.2 to -54.1). However, ratio of pulmonary to systemic 
vascular resistance decreased only in individuals who received nitric oxide and 
sildenafil. Baseline measurement of multiple-inert-gas elimination showed 
right-to-left shunt flow (4.8%, 0.0-28.2) and little perfusion of low 
ventilation(V)/perfusion(Q) areas (0.1%, 0.0-13.0). Prostacyclin increased V/Q 
mismatch (shunt 16.8%, 10.8-35.9; low V/Q 3.8%, 0.0-13.0) and decreased arterial 
oxygenation. By contrast, nitric oxide (4.5%, 0.0-18.0; 0.0%, 0.0-17.3) and 
sildenafil (3.3%, 0.0-11.3; 0.0%, 0.0-12.4) maintained V/Q matching, with raised 
arterial partial pressure of oxygen (14.3 mm Hg, -1.7 to 31.3) noted for 
sildenafil. We recorded no adverse events.
INTERPRETATION: Sildenafil causes preferential pulmonary vasodilation and 
improves gas exchange in patients with severe lung fibrosis and secondary 
pulmonary hypertension.

Curative surgery of oesophagus cancer is often challenged because of local and 
regional extension or metastasis or an impaired health in patients often 
elderly. Authors report result of palliative endoscopic treatment of dysphagia 
by prothesis in 11 patients. Improvement of dysphagia occurs in all patients. No 
death occurs by this technic. Global migration is observed in 44% because of low 
seat in 50% of cases, cardial seat in 25%, and finally important dilatation 
until 18 mm before putting prothesis. In conclusion, oesophagus prothesis is a 
palliative treatment that permit an alimentary comfort in patients with 
oesophagus cancer of 1/3 medium.

School of Public Health, USA. kominski@ucla.edu

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the burden of disease and injury in 
the Los Angeles County population using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), 
a composite measure of premature mortality and disability that equates to years 
of healthy life lost.
METHODS: DALYs, stratified by gender and race/ethnicity, were calculated for 105 
health conditions and aggregated groups of conditions for the Los Angeles County 
population for 1997. Years of Life Lost (YLLs) were calculated using 1997 county 
mortality statistics and published life tables. Years Lived with Disability 
(YLDs) were derived from age- and gender-specific disease incidence and 
disability data from the Global Burden of Disease Study.
RESULTS: DALYs produced a substantially different ranking of disease and injury 
burden than did mortality rates alone. The leading five causes of DALYs for 
males in the county were ischemic heart disease, violence, alcohol dependence, 
drug overdose and other intoxications, and depression. For females, the leading 
five causes were ischemic heart disease, alcohol dependence, diabetes, 
depression, and osteoarthritis. Differences in the rank order were also observed 
by race/ethnicity. The age-adjusted rate of DALYs for all health conditions 
combined was highest in African Americans (190 per 1,000), followed by American 
Indians (149 per 1,000), whites (113 per 1,000), Latinos (94 per 1,000), and 
Asians/Pacific Islanders (77 per 1,000).
CONCLUSIONS: The DALYs measure is a promising new tool to improve the capacity 
of local health departments and other health agencies to assess population 
health and establish an evidence base for public health decisions.

Tomorrow's challenges - today's realities making the leap, 2002 Ryley-Jeffs 
Memorial Lecture.

Martin KM(1).

Author information:
(1)Capital Health, Halifax, NS.

The premise of the presentation is a challenge to health care providers to 
examine the quality of services currently provided in health care facilities 
across the country. While the Canadian health care system is under scrutiny with 
numerous reviews and commissions, the underlying question is: are the structural 
changes making a difference? We need to consider the recommendations in the 
latest report from the Institute of Medicine, Crossing the Quality Chasm. The 
report calls for a sweeping redesign and suggests a set often new rules to guide 
patient/clinician relationships. Dietitians must take the lead on implementation 
of systematic changes, model the way and get involved in the necessary changes. 
As the report suggests, the gap between where we are and where we need to go in 
providing quality health care services is not just a crack, it is in fact a 
chasm.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after 
treatment for breast cancer is associated with increased risk of recurrence and 
mortality.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Postmenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer and 
treated by five Sydney doctors between 1964 and 1999.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Times from diagnosis to cancer recurrence or new breast 
cancer, to death from all causes and to death from primary tumour were compared 
between women who used HRT for menopausal symptoms after diagnosis and those who 
did not. Relative risks (RRs) were determined from Cox regression analyses, 
adjusted for patient and tumour characteristics.
RESULTS: 1122 women were followed up for 0-36 years (median, 6.08 years); 154 
were lost to follow-up. 286 women used HRT for menopausal symptoms for up to 26 
years (median, 1.75 years). Compared with non-users, HRT users had reduced risk 
of cancer recurrence (adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.87), 
all-cause mortality (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19-0.59) and death from primary tumour 
(RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.72). Continuous combined HRT was associated with a 
reduced risk of death from primary tumour (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.88) and 
all-cause mortality (RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10-0.73).
CONCLUSION: HRT use for menopausal symptoms by women treated for primary 
invasive breast cancer is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer 
recurrence or shortened life expectancy.

Laboratory, Room 253, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.

The United States will invest nearly US$70 billion (US$260 per capita) on 
medical research this year, more than half of which will be sponsored by the 
biopharmaceutical industry. This investment has been shown to provide major 
gains in basic, disease-oriented and patient-oriented research. It also provides 
a huge economic return on investment--whether measured in terms of jobs created, 
health costs saved, or the dollar value of lives saved. Australia, whose 
investment in medical research is less than 10% that of the United States, 
should increase its national commitment.

94611-5693, USA. edgar.schoen@kp.org

OBJECTIVE: To estimate potential costs and benefits of routinely using tandem 
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to screen newborns for inborn errors of metabolism.
METHOD: Analysis of costs and benefits resulting from use of MS/MS in screening 
of 32 000 newborn infants using data from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care 
Program of Northern California plus other published data.
SETTING: A large health maintenance organization.
RESULTS: In the base scenario, the cost per quality-adjusted life year saved by 
MS/MS screening was $5827; in the least favorable scenario, this cost was $11 
419, and in the most favorable scenario, $736.
CONCLUSION: Costs per quality-adjusted life year saved by MS/MS screening for 
inborn errors of metabolism compare favorably with other mass screening 
programs, including those for breast and prostate cancer.

Age-related impairment in the 250-millisecond delay eyeblink classical 
conditioning procedure in C57BL/6 mice.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19141, USA.

In this study we tested 4-, 9-, 12-, and 18-month-old C57BL/6 mice in the 
250-msec delay eyeblink classical conditioning procedure to study age-related 
changes in a form of associative learning. The short life expectancy of mice, 
complete knowledge about the mouse genome, and the availability of transgenic 
and knock-out mouse models of age-related impairments make the mouse an 
excellent species for expanding knowledge on the neurobiologically and 
behaviorally well-characterized eyeblink classical conditioning paradigm. Based 
on previous research with delay eyeblink conditioning in rabbits and humans, we 
predicted that mice would be impaired on this cerebellar-dependent associative 
learning task in middle-age, at ~9 months. To fully examine age differences in 
behavior in mice, we used a battery of additional behavioral measures with which 
to compare young and older mice. These behaviors included the acoustic startle 
response, prepulse inhibition, rotorod, and the Morris water maze. Mice began to 
show impairment in cerebellar-dependent tasks such as rotorod and eyeblink 
conditioning at 9 to 12 months of age. Performance in hippocampally dependent 
tasks was not impaired in any group, including 18-month-old mice. These results 
in mice support results in other species, indicating that cerebellar-dependent 
tasks show age-related deficits earlier in adulthood than do hippocampally 
dependent tasks.

BACKGROUND: About 80% of cervical cancers occur in less-developed countries. 
This disproportionate burden of cervical cancer in such countries is due mainly 
to the lack of well-organized screening programs. Several cervical cancer 
screening strategies have been proposed as more cost-effective than cytology 
screening. We compared the costs and benefits of different strategies and their 
effectiveness in saving lives in a less-developed country.
METHODS: We used a population-based simulation model to evaluate the incremental 
societal costs and benefits in Thailand of seven screening techniques, including 
visual inspection of the cervix after applying acetic acid (VIA), human 
papillomavirus (HPV) testing, Pap smear, and combinations of screening tests, 
and examined the discounted costs per year of life saved (LYS).
RESULTS: Compared with no (i.e., not well-organized) screening, all strategies 
saved lives, at costs ranging from 121 US dollars to 6720 US dollars per LYS, 
and reduced mortality, by up to 58%. Comparing each strategy with the next least 
expensive alternative, VIA performed at 5-year intervals in women of ages 35-55 
with immediate treatment if abnormalities are found was the least expensive 
option and saved the greatest number of lives, with a cost of 517 US dollars per 
LYS. HPV screening resulted in similar costs and benefits, if the test cost is 5 
US dollars and if 90% of women undergo follow-up after an abnormal screen. 
Cytology (Pap smear) was a reasonable alternative if sensitivity exceeds 80% and 
if 90% of women undergo follow-up. Compared with no screening, use of a 
combination of Pap smear and HPV testing at 5-year intervals in women of ages 
20-70 could achieve greater than 90% reduction in cervical cancer mortality at a 
cost of 1683 US dollars per LYS, and VIA could achieve 83% reduction at 524 US 
dollars per LYS.
CONCLUSIONS: Well-organized screening programs can reduce cervical cancer 
mortality in less-developed countries at low costs. These cost-effectiveness 
data can enhance decision-making about optimal policies for a given setting.

Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of stress myocardial SPECT and stress 
echocardiography in suspected coronary artery disease considering the prognostic

BACKGROUND: The prognoses of patients with false-negative test results by 
myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and by stress 
echocardiography are known to be different; the prognosis with false-negative 
SPECT is better in suspected and proven coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Three strategies by which to diagnose CAD were compared for 
their cost-effectiveness when considering the prognostic value of false-negative 
results: (1) stress myocardial SPECT by dipyridamole or adenosine followed by 
coronary angiography (CAG), (2) exercise stress echocardiography followed by 
CAG, and (3) dobutamine stress echocardiography followed by CAG. Delta 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for the three strategies 
separately when annual mortality and infarction rates were 0.5% and 0.5% for 
myocardial SPECT and 2% and 2% for stress echocardiography, respectively. Costs 
were estimated and costs per DeltaQALY were calculated according to the pretest 
likelihood of CAD (pCAD). The myocardial SPECT followed by CAG strategy was the 
most cost-effective in the patients with a pCAD of 0.3 or greater, and the 
dobutamine echocardiography followed by CAG strategy was the most cost-effective 
in patients with a pCAD of 0.2 or lower. This was the case when we assumed that 
the nondiagnostic test rate of dobutamine echocardiography was 9% (in contrast 
to 0% by myocardial SPECT and 18% by exercise echocardiography). Sensitivity 
analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of dobutamine echocardiography 
followed by CAG was best only if the prognosis of false-negative results of 
dobutamine echocardiography was better. The cost-effectiveness of exercise 
echocardiography was dubious because of the high nondiagnostic rate with 
inadequate exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: When the lower event rates of (false) negative SPECT were 
considered, the relatively expensive myocardial SPECT strategy was more 
cost-effective than the cheaper stress echocardiography strategy in patients 
with a pCAD of 0.3 or greater. According to sensitivity analysis, the prognostic 
value of false-negative results and the nondiagnostic test rate were important 
determinants of stress myocardial study cost-effectiveness.

Oral antihypertensive trial design and analysis under the pediatric exclusivity 
provision.

Pasquali SK(1), Sanders SP, Li JS.

Author information:
(1)Pediatric Cardiovascular Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 
27710, USA.

BACKGROUND: The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides a 6-year 
extension to the economic incentives offered to drug manufacturers under the 
Pediatric Exclusivity Provision, for providing requested information on drugs 
used in children, which includes >50 oral antihypertensive medications. 
Guidelines were published outlining specific requirements for the design and 
analysis of trials to provide the requested information.
METHODS: We review the design and analysis requirements, along with recruitment 
and eligibility guidelines, for dose-ranging studies of oral antihypertensives 
in children in light of ethical and methodologic issues unique to pediatric 
research. We also discuss examples of trials conducted to date and the 
implications and limitations of legislative efforts.
RESULTS: Four possible trial types are outlined in the guidelines. Trial C, 
which uses a randomized withdrawal phase after treatment, has been used most 
often. Avoidance of a true placebo arm may enhance patient recruitment and 
minimize ethical concerns at the expense of a more complicated design and 
analysis. In addition, this trial involves little risk for manufacturers because 
patent extension does not depend on the outcome of the trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies being conducted under the Pediatric Exclusivity Provision 
will provide valuable information concerning dosing and efficacy for several 
antihypertensive medications used in children. New legislation may stimulate 
study of drugs without remaining patent life, but data on safety, long-term 
outcomes, and the youngest pediatric age groups are also needed for a full 
understanding of all issues pertinent to pediatric use.

Associates of Miami, Miami Beach, Fla 33140, USA.

BACKGROUND: Health value or utility is the abstracted magnitude of a person's 
preference for quality and quantity of life. It reflects how much lifetime with 
the patient's current health condition a patient is willing to exchange for a 
life in excellent health. Health values are used in cost-effectiveness analysis 
as a means of calculating quality-adjusted years of life.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the health values of elderly patients before and 
after pacemaker implantation.
METHODS: We prospectively examined 398 patients from the Pacemaker Selection in 
the Elderly study, in which patients were randomized to either VVIR or DDDR 
mode. Health values were estimated with the time tradeoff method before 
implantation and at 3, 9, and 18 months after implantation.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 76 +/- 6 years; 234 patients (59%) were 
male. At baseline, patients were, on average, willing to exchange 5 years of 
current health for approximately 4 years in perfect health (value 0.76 +/- 
0.06). There was no difference in baseline health values with implant diagnosis 
(sinus node dysfunction n = 172, 0.72, atrioventricular block n = 227, 0.75, 
other diagnoses n = 39, 0.78, P = not significant). The overall improvement in 
health values at 3 months after pacemaker implantation was 0.165 +/- 0.4 (P 
=.0001). The improvement in health values was independent of pacing mode (P 
=.6). The time tradeoff score was modestly correlated with other measurements of 
health-related quality of life. The change in time tradeoff score with time was 
not influenced by demographic characteristics such as age and sex, diagnoses, 
pacing mode, employment status, or history of angina. Patients with a lower 
functional class at enrollment (III or IV on the Specific Activity Scale) 
demonstrated an absolute improvement of 23% in their health values, whereas 
patients in class I or II improved only by 12%, (P =.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Permanent pacemaker implantation for standard indications improves 
health values and descriptive health status measures. The values reported here 
may be used as a means of calculating the cost-effectiveness of different pacing 
modalities.

The quantitative importance of ageing both in developed or in developing 
countries raised the subtle question of the quality of life of the ageing 
person. Precise definitions of life expectancy, healthy life expectancy and 
quality of life are presented. Then, presentation of the results of two 
cross-sectional studies performed with the same methodology at a 15-year time 
interval in French-speaking Switzerland illustrates compression of morbidity 
theory, with increased longevity, increased good perception of health and 
increased quality of life. Moreover, quantitative data concerning the longevity 
impact of hospital geriatric care are presented from Geneva. The 4-year survival 
rate of over 85 year old women, discharged from the hospital for acute care, 
reached 48%. Explanations of these outstanding medical progresses on longevity 
and socio-economical challenges of extreme ageing are discussed in the world 
context.

challenge].

[Article in French]

Israël L.

The life expectancy, at the age of 75 years, is nowadays 11 years for men and 
13.5 for women, and is still increasing. Two aspects are here discussed; (i) the 
role of independent elderly people bringing to the younger generations financial 
support, experience, rules of social behaviour and memory, and (ii) the specific 
needs of solidarity that society and family have to provide to dependent elderly 
people. Adequate management of these problems is certainly a challenge for our 
culture.

With an expectation of life at birth of 27 years in the middle of the 18th 
century, 21% of males reached their 60th birthday with a remaining expectation 
of life of 12 years. Under the conditions of mortality of 1950, in France, 70 
percent could celebrate their 60th birthday, and they had still 15 years (only) 
to live on the average. This last figure started increasing after 1950: the 
expectancy of life at age 60 is now over 20 years, and it will exceed 25 years 
around 2050 (for women, the mean will be 31 years). Longevity is an individual 
capacity. It is now increasing fast, and becomes more and more responsible for 
the ageing of the population (the rise in the proportion of older persons in the 
population). We now try to forecast the number of centenarians, and even of 
super-centenarians (aged 110 years and more), and speculate about the maximum 
life span. We are in fact entering an entirely new era, when three, four, even 
five generations can survive simultaneously. Are we prepared to it? The French 
Ministers for Research and for Social affairs set up a Committee of 15 members 
(chaired by Henri Leridon) to prepare a National Meeting of Researchers on 
Ageing, in order to review the situation of research in France on this issue and 
to make proposals for organising and orienting new studies. The life span of 
human species, as well as the one of individuals, is undoubtedly depending upon 
genetic factors. But interactions with environmental factors and with behaviour 
also play a major role. To be able to disentangle these complex associations, it 
will be necessary to combine the work of biologists, clinicians and social 
sciences specialists. The main conclusions of the June 2001 meeting are reported 
here, together with some orientations of demographic research on mortality at 
oldest ages and the limits of longevity.

Genetic susceptibility to ageing-associated diseases.

The constant and rapid increase of life expectancy in western countries is 
associated with a major ageing of our populations. In these conditions, we can 
expect an epidemic progression of most chronic diseases, especially 
cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, the main causes of 
death in the world. The global burden of these diseases will have a dramatic 
impact on the health and on the socio-economical context of our societies. From 
a global point of view, the occurrence and progression of these multifactorial 
diseases rely upon the nature and intensity of the environmental determinants we 
are exposed to all life long, but also to our individual genetic susceptibility. 
Through the determination of this higher susceptibility to an environmental risk 
factor and the understanding of its mechanisms of action, prevention and 
management efforts will be better focused. In such multifactorial affections, 
the development and the transmission of the disease do not follow the simple 
laws of monogenic Mendelian models. The complexity of this transmission is 
associated with the influence, at various degrees, of several genes and of a 
close interaction between this particular genetic susceptibility and 
environmental risk factors. With the recent development of automated and high 
throughput molecular biology techniques and their use in epidemiological 
studies, gene expression regulation and post genomic studies, the determination 
of sub-groups facing a higher individual genetic susceptibility has begun. This 
determination will offer new clues for a better-targeted disease management.

Cost-effectiveness of newer treatment strategies for influenza.

General Internal Medicine, and the Center for Research on Health Care,

PURPOSE: Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of influenza, such as 
rapid testing and neuraminidase inhibitor therapy, are available, but their 
place in clinical practice and their cost-effectiveness have not been 
determined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of these newer 
interventions, we used a decision model that compared several influenza 
management strategies: no testing or treatment, amantadine or rimantadine 
treatment without testing, testing then amantadine or rimantadine treatment, 
neuraminidase inhibitor treatment without testing, or testing then neuraminidase 
inhibitor treatment. Antiviral therapy began within 48 hours in febrile patients 
with characteristic symptoms of influenza. We assumed that antiviral treatment 
did not change rates of influenza complication or mortality, and chose parameter 
values in the baseline analysis to bias slightly against antiviral treatment and 
toward testing strategies.
RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, testing strategies are more expensive and 
less effective than treatment strategies. Amantadine costs $9.06 per illness day 
avoided or $11.60 per quality-adjusted day gained. Compared with amantadine, 
zanamivir costs $198 per illness day avoided or $185 per quality-adjusted day 
gained, whereas oseltamivir costs $252 per illness day avoided or $235 per 
quality-adjusted day gained. In elderly patients who require reduced dosage, 
rimantadine costs $128 per quality-adjusted day gained compared with amantadine. 
In younger patients, amantadine is favored if the likelihood of influenza A is 
>67%; otherwise, neuraminidase inhibitors are favored. Testing strategies are 
more costly and less effective when the influenza probability is >30%. No 
testing or treatment is favored if the influenza probability is <32% and the 
influenza utility is >0.77. In elderly patients, amantadine is favored over 
rimantadine if the utility of medication side effects is >0.94.
CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral treatment of influenza without rapid testing is 
reasonable economically in febrile patients with typical symptoms during 
influenza season. The choice of antiviral agent depends on age, the likelihood 
of influenza A, and the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted day gained.

A series of DNA-linked RNases H, in which the 15-mer DNA is cross-linked to the 
Thermus thermophilus RNase HI (TRNH) variants at positions 135, 136, 137 and 
138, were constructed and analyzed for their abilities to cleave the 
complementary 15-mer RNA. Of these, that with the DNA adduct at position 135 
most efficiently cleaved the RNA substrate, indicating that position 135 is the 
most appropriate cross-linking site among those examined. To examine whether 
DNA-linked RNase H also site-specifically cleaves a highly structured natural 
RNA, DNA-linked TRNHs with a series of DNA adducts varying in size at position 
135 were constructed and analyzed for their abilities to cleave MS2 RNA. These 
DNA adducts were designed such that DNA-linked enzymes cleave MS2 RNA at a loop 
around residue 2790. Of the four DNA-linked TRNHs with the 8-, 12-, 16- and 
20-mer DNA adducts, only that with the 16-mer DNA adduct efficiently and 
site-specifically cleaved MS2 RNA. Primer extension revealed that this 
DNA-linked TRNH cleaved MS2 RNA within the target sequence.

[Status of aortic valve reconstruction and Ross operation in aortic valve 
diseases].

[Article in German]

Sievers HH(1).

BACKGROUND: At first glance the aortic valve is a relative simple valve 
mechanism connecting the left ventricle and the ascending aorta. Detailed 
analysis of the different components of the aortic valve including the leaflets 
and sinuses revealed a complex motion of each part leading to a perfect durable 
valve mechanism at rest and during exercise. Theoretically, the reconstruction 
or imitation of these structures in patients with aortic valve disease should 
lead to optimal results. Prerequisite is the exact knowledge of the important 
functional characteristics of the aortic valve. The dynamic behavior of the 
aortic root closely harmonizing with the leaflets not only warrants stress 
minimizing and valve durability, but also optimizes coronary flow, left 
ventricular function and aortic impedance. The newly discovered contractile 
capacity of the leaflets and the root components are important for tuning the 
dynamics.
AORTIC VALVE RECONSTRUCTION: Isolated reconstruction of the aortic valve such as 
decalcification, commissurotomy, plication of ring or leaflets of a tricuspid 
aortic valve and cusp extension are seldom indicated in contrast to the 
reconstruction of the bicuspid insufficient valve. Proper indication and skilled 
techniques lead to excellent hemodynamic and clinical intermediate-term result 
up to 7 years after reconstruction. Latest follow-up revealed a mean aortic 
insufficiency of 0.7, maximal pressure gradient of 11.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg with zero 
hospital or late mortality, reoperation or thromboembolic events in 22 patients. 
The reconstructive techniques for aortic root aneurysm and/or type A dissection 
according to David or Yacoub have become routine procedures in the last 10 
years. The hemodynamic and clinical results are excellent with low reoperation 
rate and very low risk of thromboembolism. Generally, a maximal diameter of the 
root of 5 cm is indicative for performing the operation. In patients with 
Marfan's syndrome the reconstruction should be advanced even with smaller 
diameters especially if these are progressive and combined with aortic 
insufficiency. ROSS-OPERATION: The Ross-Operation includes the replacement of 
the diseased aortic valve with the pulmonary autograft and reconstruction of the 
right ventricular outflow tract using a homograft. The hemodynamic results are 
excellent regarding the autograft and also the clinical results with very low 
thromboembolic risk and acceptable reoperation rate. This method is especially 
indicated for active young patients, women, who desire children, athletes and 
patients in general, who like to avoid long-term anticoagulation. In some cases 
the homograft may develop a dysfunction predominantly a pulmonary stenosis 
requiring reoperation. In the author's series of 245 Ross-operations in 12 years 
the homograft had to be replaced in 4 cases without letality. Innovative, 
decellularized homografts with the potential to repopulate with autologeous 
cells show promising results after 1 year of clinical implantation without signs 
of antibody development. Probably these tissue-engineered modification may 
improve the homograft results. The reconstructive techniques of the aortic valve 
and the Ross-operation have a certain risk of reoperation that must be weighed 
against the advantages of very low hospital and late valve related death, 
excellent hemodynamics, very low risk of macro- and microembolism as well as 
bleeding, lack of long-term anticoagulation and unrestricted life-style.

Dementia, the fate of brain? Neuropathological point of view.

The prevalence of dementia dramatically increases during ageing, and this puts a 
serious strain on the optimism brought by the continuous increase in life 
expectancy observed in most industrialised countries. Diseases that produce 
dementia are numerous, and the cognitive deficit results from lesions of various 
regions and from different mechanisms. This modulates the possible prediction, 
prevention and cure of dementia. Emphasis is put on the necessity of, and 
prerequisite for, efficient research in the field of dementia. Three 
paradigmatic dementing disorders are reviewed. Subacute spongiform 
encephalopathies (prion diseases) constitute a biological enigma and a public 
health concern. In Alzheimer's disease and vascular or mixed dementia, the 
clinical diagnosis is still imperfect, and this hinders research. Distinguishing 
and accurately identifying the various types of dementia is essential for 
understanding their mechanism and for developing efficient therapeutic 
strategies, preventive and curative. For such objectives, the study of human 
brain tissue will remain mandatory until non-invasive markers and additional 
models are available. Ethical reasons banish the use of cerebral biopsy and 
favour the promotion of autopsy.
