studies reporting HSUVs with high sensitivity (95 percent) and two other search 
filters (FSF2 and FSF3) with reasonably high sensitivity (92 percent and 88 
percent) but greater precision, resulting in a lower NNR. These seem to be the 
first validated filters available for HSUVs. The availability of filters with a 
range of sensitivity and precision options enables researchers to choose the 
filter which is most appropriate to the resources available for their specific 
research.

The aim of this paper is to gain better understanding of the ocular 
manifestations of multiple system atrophy (MSA), a neurodegenerative disorder 
rarely studied in terms of its ophthalmologic features. We performed a 
retrospective case series (1/1/05-12/31/14) to search for patients seen at Mayo 
Clinic, Rochester, MN, who had mention of MSA in the medical record and an eye 
examination, which yielded 285 cases. Of the 285, we identified 39 cases of true 
MSA. Each of these 39 patients was further reviewed for ocular abnormalities 
potentially related to MSA. Ocular findings potentially attributable to MSA were 
found in 64% of patients. Most common were dry eye (N = 14), conjugate eye 
movement abnormalities (N = 13), and ocular misalignment (N = 7). One patient 
had dry eye and monocular diplopia from trichiasis due to cicatricial 
pemphigoid, one had bilateral optic atrophy, and one had Adie's tonic pupil. 
Conjugate eye movement abnormalities (33%) and ocular misalignment (18%) were 
more common in patients with MSA-C. Patients with ocular findings, excluding dry 
eye, had a significantly shorter lifespan from time of initial neurologic 
symptoms to death. Our study confirms conjugate eye movement abnormalities and 
misalignment are common ocular findings in patients with MSA. Bilateral optic 
atrophy and cicatricial pemphigoid are possibly attributable to the disease. 
Ocular manifestations in MSA predict a poor prognosis as these patients have a 
significantly shorter lifespan. Therefore, we recommend patients with MSA have a 
comprehensive neuro-ophthalmologic exam at time of diagnosis, and thereafter, to 
screen for eye findings that may indicate a shorter lifespan.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Whether gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) or duodenal stent (DS) 
placement is preferable for treatment of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) in 
patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer is unclear. We compared the 
usefulness of GJJ with that of DS placement in these patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 66 consecutive patients with unresectable 
pancreatic cancer who underwent GJJ or DS placement for symptomatic GOO.
RESULTS: We analyzed 30 patients who underwent GJJ and 23 who underwent DS 
placement. Peritoneal metastasis was more common in the DS group. Median 
survival after the first intervention was similar in both groups. Although 
clinical success (maintaining a GOO Scoring System score ≥2 for more than 7 
days) rate was significantly higher in the GJJ group (100% vs. 81%), clinical 
benefit (maintaining a score ≥2 for more than half of their survival after the 
first intervention) rate was similar between the GJJ and DS groups (66.7% vs. 
69.7%), even among patients who survived for ≥90 days (73.3% vs. 75.0%). 
Further, the proportion of patients who could receive planned chemotherapy after 
the first intervention was higher and the time to administration of chemotherapy 
was significantly shorter in the DS group (9 vs. 32 days). Major complication 
rate was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that DS placement is as effective as GJJ for 
the treatment of GOO in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, even in 
those with a long life expectancy. DS placement might be more beneficial than 
GJJ in patients for whom chemotherapy is planned.

Existing isothermal nucleic acid amplification (INAA) relying on the strand 
displacement activity of DNA polymerase usually requires at least two primers. 
However, in this paper, we report an unusual isothermal multimerization and 
amplification (UIMA) which only needs one primer and is efficiently initiated by 
the strand-displacing DNA polymerases with reverse transcription activities. On 
electrophoresis, the products of UIMA present a cascade-shape band and they are 
confirmed to be multimeric DNAs with repeated target sequences. In contrast to 
current methods, UIMA is simple to product multimeric DNA, due to the 
independent of multiple primers and rolling circle structures. Through assaying 
the synthesized single-stranded DNA targets, UIMA performs high sensitivity and 
specificity, as well as the universality. In addition, a plausible mechanism of 
UIMA is proposed, involving short DNA bending, mismatch extension, and template 
slippage. UIMA is a good explanation for why nonspecific amplification easily 
happens in existing INAAs. As the simplest INAA till now, UIMA provides a new 
insight for deeply understanding INAA and opens a new avenue for thoroughly 
addressing nonspecific amplification.

INTRODUCTION: As a result of improved safe and effective therapeutic options for 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), life expectancy of those living with HIV is 
increasing leading to new challenges (e.g., management of chronic diseases). 
Some chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease [CVD]), are up to two times 
more prevalent in patients with HIV. Statins are a mainstay of therapy for 
prevention of CVD; but, clinicians should be aware that not all statins are 
appropriate for use in the HIV population, especially those receiving 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). The purpose of this article is to review the 
pharmacokinetic and clinical data for statin therapy in HIV-infected patients 
receiving ART.
METHODS: A systematic literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE databases was 
performed using each statin drug name combined with HIV, pharmacokinetics, AIDS, 
and/or human immunodeficiency virus. English language trials published from 1946 
to November 2016 were considered, and results were limited to clinical efficacy 
trials.
RESULTS: In general, atorvastatin and pravastatin are safe and effective for 
patients treated with protease-inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor-based ART. Rosuvastatin is generally considered safe if 
started at a low dose, but should be avoided if possible in patients receiving 
PI-based ART. Pitavastatin has limited supporting evidence, but appears safe for 
use based on its pharmacokinetic properties and low number of drug interactions. 
Fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin should be avoided in patients receiving 
ART due to drug interactions, adverse events, and/or limited clinical data.
CONCLUSION: Clinicians need to be familiar with the intricacies of statin 
selection for the prevention of CVD in patients with HIV on ART.

Falls are a major determinant of poor quality of life, immobilization, and 
reduced life expectancy in people affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) and in 
older adults more generally. Although many questions remain, recent research has 
advanced the understanding of this complex problem. The goal of this review is 
to condense new knowledge of falls in PD from prodromal to advanced disease, 
taking into account risk factors, assessment, and classification as well as 
treatment. The fundamental steps of clinical and research-based approaches to 
falls are described, namely, the identification of fall risk factors, clinical 
and instrumental methods to evaluate and classify fall risk, and the latest 
evidence to reduce or delay falls in PD. We summarize recent developments, the 
direction in which the field should be heading, and what can be recommended at 
this stage. We also provide a practical algorithm for clinicians.© 2017

Comment in
    Euro Surveill. 2017 Oct;22(42):

Clinical effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV 
acquisition in men who have sex with men (MSM) at high HIV risk is established. 
A static decision analytical model was constructed to inform policy 
prioritisation in England around cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of a 
PrEP programme covering 5,000 MSM during an initial high-risk period. National 
genitourinary medicine clinic surveillance data informed key HIV risk 
assumptions. Pragmatic large-scale implementation scenarios were explored. At 
86% effectiveness, PrEP given to 5,000 MSM at 3.3 per 100 person-years annual 
HIV incidence, assuming risk compensation (20% HIV incidence increase), averted 
118 HIV infections over remaining lifetimes and was cost saving. Lower 
effectiveness (64%) gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of + GBP 23,500 
(EUR 32,000) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Investment of GBP 
26.9 million (EUR 36.6 million) in year-1 breaks even anywhere from year-23 (86% 
effectiveness) to year-33 (64% effectiveness). PrEP cost-effectiveness was 
highly sensitive to year-1 HIV incidence, PrEP adherence/effectiveness, and 
antiretroviral drug costs. There is much uncertainty around HIV incidence in 
those given PrEP and adherence/effectiveness, especially under programme 
scale-up. Substantially reduced PrEP drug costs are needed to give the necessary 
assurance of cost-effectiveness, and for an affordable public health programme 
of sufficient size.

BACKGROUND: At present, red blood cells (RBCs) are stored for up to 42 days 
prior to transfusion. The relative effectiveness and safety of different RBC 
storage times prior to transfusion is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
transfusing fresher RBCs (stored for ≤ 7 days) compared with current 
standard-aged RBCs in critically ill patients requiring blood transfusions.
DESIGN: The international Age of BLood Evaluation (ABLE) trial was a 
multicentre, randomised, blinded trial undertaken in Canada, the UK, the 
Netherlands and France. The UK trial was funded to contribute patients to the 
international trial and undertake a UK-specific health economic evaluation.
SETTING: Twenty intensive care units (ICUs) in the UK, as part of 64 
international centres.
PARTICIPANTS: Critically ill patients aged ≥ 18 years (≥ 16 years in Scotland) 
expected to require mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 hours and requiring a first 
RBC transfusion during the first 7 days in the ICU.
INTERVENTIONS: All decisions to transfuse RBCs were made by clinicians. One 
patient group received exclusively fresh RBCs stored for ≤ 7 days whenever 
transfusion was required from randomisation until hospital discharge. The other 
group received standard-issue RBCs throughout their hospital stay.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary 
outcomes included development of organ dysfunction, new thrombosis, infections 
and transfusion reactions. The primary economic evaluation was a cost-utility 
analysis.
RESULTS: The international trial took place between March 2009 and October 2014 
(UK recruitment took place between January 2012 and October 2014). In total, 
1211 patients were assigned to receive fresh blood and 1219 patients to receive 
standard-aged blood. RBCs were stored for a mean of 6.1 days [standard deviation 
(SD) ± 4.9 days] in the group allocated to receive fresh blood and 22.0 days 
(SD ± 8.4 days) in the group allocated to receive standard-aged blood. Patients 
received a mean of 4.3 RBC units (SD ± 5.2 RBC units) and 4.3 RBC units 
(SD ± 5.5 RBC units) in the groups receiving fresh blood and standard-aged 
blood, respectively. At 90 days, 37.0% of patients in the group allocated to 
receive fresh blood and 35.3% of patients in the group allocated to receive 
standard-aged blood had died {absolute risk difference 1.7% [95% confidence 
interval (CI) -2.1% to 5.5%]}. There were no between-group differences in any 
secondary outcomes. The UK cohort comprised 359 patients randomised and followed 
up for 12 months for the cost-utility analysis. UK patients had similar 
characteristics and outcomes to the international cohort. Mean total costs per 
patient were £32,346 (95% CI £29,306 to £35,385) in the group allocated to 
receive fresh blood and £33,353 (95% CI £29,729 to £36,978) in the group 
allocated to receive standard-aged blood. Approximately 85% of the total costs 
were incurred during the index hospital admission. There were no significant 
cost differences between the two groups [mean incremental costs for those 
receiving fresh vs. standard-aged blood: -£231 (95% CI -£4876 to £4415)], nor 
were there significant differences in outcomes (mean difference in 
quality-adjusted life-years -0.010, 95% CI -0.078 to 0.057).
LIMITATIONS: Adverse effects from the exclusive use of older RBCs compared with 
standard or fresh RBCs cannot be excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of RBCs aged ≤ 7 days confers no clinical or economic 
benefit in critically ill patients compared with standard-aged RBCs.
FUTURE WORK: Future studies should address the safety of RBCs near the end of 
the current permitted storage age.

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

Duble SN(1), Thomas SV(1).

Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India.

People with epilepsy have increased risk of premature death, and their life 
expectancy may reduce by 2-10 yr. Population- and hospital-based studies have 
shown that the excess mortality in epilepsy is not entirely explained by deaths 
directly attributable to epilepsy such as accidents and drowning during a 
seizure. It is also significantly contributed by deaths from other causes such 
as cardiac deaths, deaths due to malignancies and other causes. It had recently 
been recognized that sudden unexpected deaths in epilepsy (SUDEP) contributed to 
a small yet important proportion of mortality in epilepsy. SUDEPs are deaths 
(witnessed or unwitnessed) unrelated to trauma, drowning or status epilepticus 
and not attributable to any specific medical conditions. Several factors related 
to epilepsy and drug therapy have been found to be associated with higher risk 
of SUDEP.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic 
disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral cytopenia, 
and their possible transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). They 
typically affect the elderly but, when making treatment decisions, considering 
chronological age may be insufficient because it poorly correlates with patient 
frailty: the challenge is to select the optimal treatment in these patients by 
balancing efficacy and toxicity. Areas covered: This review discusses the 
rationale for and methods of personalizing the treatment of elderly MDS 
patients. Expert commentary: Decisions concerning treatment strategies for 
elderly MDS patients should be made after assessing their frailty on the basis 
of a geriatric assessment and an estimate of age-adjusted life expectancy. We 
suggest that all elderly MDS patients should undergo a timed up and go test 
(TUGT) as a preliminary means of identifying frail patients, and that all 
non-frail patients should then undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment 
(CGA) in order to distinguish fit and pre-frail patients. Fit patients should 
receive standard dose treatment; pre-frail patients should receive 
individualized therapy; and frail patients should receive symptom-related 
therapy. A repeated CGA may be useful to evaluate the hematological, cognitive 
and socio-relational effects of MDS treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The burden of disease from dementia is a growing global concern as 
incidence increases dramatically with age, and average life expectancy has been 
increasing around the world. Planning for an ageing population requires reliable 
projections of dementia prevalence; however, existing population projections are 
simple and have poor predictive accuracy. The Dementia Population Risk Tool 
(DemPoRT) will predict incidence of dementia in the population setting using 
multivariable modelling techniques and will be used to project dementia 
prevalence.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The derivation cohort will consist of elderly Ontario 
respondents of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (2001, 2003, 2005 and 
2007; 18 764 males and 25 288 females). Prespecified predictors include 
sociodemographic, general health, behavioural, functional and health condition 
variables. Incident dementia will be identified through individual linkage of 
survey respondents to population-level administrative healthcare databases (1797 
and 3281 events, and 117 795 and 166 573 person-years of follow-up, for males 
and females, respectively, until 31 March 2014). Using time of first dementia 
capture as the primary outcome and death as a competing risk, sex-specific 
proportional hazards regression models will be estimated. The 2008/2009 CCHS 
survey will be used for validation (approximately 4600 males and 6300 females). 
Overall calibration and discrimination will be assessed as well as calibration 
within predefined subgroups of importance to clinicians and policy makers.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval has been granted by the 
Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board. DemPoRT results will be 
submitted for publication in peer-review journals and presented at scientific 
meetings. The algorithm will be assessable online for both population and 
individual uses.

Psychiatry and society are interrelated and the biopsychosocial model continues 
to dominate the clinical psychiatric practice. Some doubts have been expressed 
in recent years about the value and the wide acceptance of the biopsychosocial 
model. Ghaemi (2009)1 considers it to be anti-humanistic and advocates the use 
of less eclectic, less generic, and less vague alternatives. The fundamental 
changes that have been witnessed in our times across the spectrum of biology, 
psychology and sociology have made necessary that a conceptual clarity should 
prevail. The remarkable advances in neurosciences, neurobiology and genetics 
tend to swing the emphasis towards a more biological basis. Psychosis for 
example is the condition often regarded as being biologically constructed and 
most independent of the social context. The symptoms, however, of hallucinations 
and delusions in psychosis have social meaning for the person experiencing them 
and are primarily defined socially.2 Furthermore, vulnerability is often the 
result of social trauma, whether in the form of recent stressors that trigger 
onset, or earlier circumstances that shape cognitive and emotional style. 
Moreover, the approved treatment and management of long term psychiatric 
disorders has involved interventions that are either directly social, or 
psychosocial. Furthermore, doubts have also been raised by the endophenotype 
project,3 related to the genetics of schizophrenia. Cohen4 suggested that there 
may be more individual genotypic patterns associated with schizophrenia than 
people with schizophrenia on the planet. A recent alternative interpretation 
(network approach) is gaining some support. It suggests that a stressor causes 
symptoms that activate other symptoms, in a circular, self-reinforcing way.5 
This theory moves away from psychiatric disorders being traditionally 
conceptualised as categorical or dimensional models. While psychiatry has 
shifted its focus to a more biological approach, social factors still have an 
important role in crosscultural diagnosis, psychiatric disorders relating to 
social deprivation, rehabilitation and enabling social inclusion. The degree to 
which society is willing to accept people with mental health problems has an 
obvious impact on their quality of life. We live in a period of cataclysmic 
social changes with disastrous wars, increased poverty and growing income 
inequality. The consequences on mental health are phenomenal with epidemics of 
self-harm and suicidality, higher rates of depression, and intensifying 
diagnosis of mood and conduct disorders in children and young adults. Other 
adversities include the disproportional number of people with mental health 
problems in prisons and penal institutions, the massive escalation of dementia 
sufferers and the shortcomings of the aspirations of community mental health 
care. In addition, there is an escalating social pathology with significant 
numbers of refugees and asylum seekers and rising numbers of homeless 
particularly in urban areas of the developed world. We should not, however, 
overlook the better rates of treatment for mental health problems, the emphasis 
on human rights, the empowerment and the service users' participation and the 
development in global mental health. All these social factors are important to 
contemporary psychiatry presenting complex challenges and demanding urgent 
attention and action.6 There is a need to embrace the development of 
evidence-based mental health services and a pluralistic approach, which balances 
appropriately the relevance of biological, psychological and social factors 
associated with mental health problems. The concept Meta-Community mental health 
builds on the successes of biological, psychological, social and community 
psychiatry.7 It incorporates neurosciences, sociology, psychology and 
anthropology and is delivered wherever the evidence shows that it makes a 
difference, whether in community or hospital, prisons, schools, court-room, 
place of work, refugee camp or battle-front. New technologies should be included 
for public information and education together with e-mental health, training of 
providers, tele-psychiatry and self-help methods delivered via IT. The 
boundaries of mental health are enlarging very rapidly and indeed new 
stakeholders and partners should be welcomed. This opens exciting possibilities 
but also creates some risks and strong evidence base should continue to guide 
us. Likelihood of finding early diagnostic and individualized treatment for 
psychosis, autism and dementia are likely to be of high financial cost. The 
importance of the social challenges of modern psychiatry was recognised by 
including mental health for the first time in the New Sustainable Development 
Goals of United Nations that will determine the global development by 2030 
aiming at the promotion of life expectancy for all.8 Strengthening the 
prevention and treatment of mental health problems is a massive task for 
sustainable development as mental health has a direct impact on the whole range 
of Sustainable Development Goals.

Lung cancer is one of the most aggressive tumours with very low life expectancy. 
Altered microRNA expression is found in human tumours because it is involved in 
tumour growth, progression and metastasis. In this study, we analysed microRNA 
expression in 47 lung cancer biopsies. Among the most downregulated microRNAs we 
focussed on the miR-99a characterisation. In vitro experiments showed that 
miR-99a expression decreases the proliferation of H1650, H1975 and H1299 lung 
cancer cells causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We identified two novel 
proteins, E2F2 (E2F transcription factor 2) and EMR2 (EGF-like 
module-containing, mucin-like, hormone receptor-like 2), downregulated by 
miR-99a by its direct binding to their 3'-UTR. Moreover, miR-99a expression 
prevented cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and repressed 
the tumourigenic potential of the cancer stem cell (CSC) population in both 
these cell lines and mice tumours originated from H1975 cells. The expression of 
E2F2 and EMR2 at protein level was studied in 119 lung cancer biopsies. E2F2 and 
EMR2 are preferentially expressed in adenocarcinomas subtypes versus other 
tumour types (squamous and others). Interestingly, the expression of E2F2 
correlates with the presence of vimentin and both E2F2 and EMR2 correlate with 
the presence of β-catenin. Moreover, miR-99a expression correlates inversely 
with E2F2 and directly with β-catenin expression in lung cancer biopsies. In 
conclusion, miR-99a reveals two novel targets E2F2 and EMR2 that play a key role 
in lung tumourigenesis. By inhibiting E2F2 and EMR2, miR-99a represses in vivo 
the transition of epithelial cells through an EMT process concomitantly with the 
inhibition of stemness features and consequently decreasing the CSC population.

Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) has been widely used for analyses of nucleosome 
locations in many organisms. However, due to its sequence preference, the 
interpretations of the positions and occupancies of nucleosomes using MNase have 
remained controversial. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has also been utilized 
for analyses of MNase-digests, but some technical biases are commonly present in 
the NGS experiments. Here, we established a gel-based method to map nucleosome 
positions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using isolated nuclei as the substrate 
for the histone H4 S47C-site-directed chemical cleavage in parallel with MNase 
digestion. The parallel mapping allowed us to compare the chemically and 
enzymatically cleaved sites by indirect end-labeling and primer extension 
mapping, and thus we could determine the nucleosome positions and the sizes of 
the nucleosome-free regions (or nucleosome-depleted regions) more accurately, as 
compared to nucleosome mapping by MNase alone. The analysis also revealed that 
the structural features of the nucleosomes flanked by the nucleosome-free region 
were different from those within regularly arrayed nucleosomes, showing that the 
structures and dynamics of individual nucleosomes strongly depend on their 
locations. Moreover, we demonstrated that the parallel mapping results were 
generally consistent with the previous genome-wide chemical mapping and 
MNase-Seq results. Thus, the gel-based parallel mapping will be useful for the 
analysis of a specific locus under various conditions.

OBJECTIVE: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) commonly is used 
for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) after patients have failed 
to benefit from trials of multiple antidepressant medications. No analysis to 
date has examined the cost-effectiveness of rTMS used earlier in the course of 
treatment and over a patients' lifetime.
METHODS: We used lifetime Markov simulation modeling to compare the direct costs 
and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of rTMS and medication therapy in 
patients with newly diagnosed MDD (ages 20-59) who had failed to benefit from 
one pharmacotherapy trial. Patients' life expectancies, rates of response and 
remission, and quality of life outcomes were derived from the literature, and 
treatment costs were based upon published Medicare reimbursement data. Baseline 
costs, aggregate per year quality of life assessments (QALYs), Monte Carlo 
simulation, tornado analysis, assessment of dominance, and one way sensitivity 
analysis were also performed. The discount rate applied was 3%.
RESULTS: Lifetime direct treatment costs, and QALYs identified rTMS as the 
dominant therapy compared to antidepressant medications (i.e., lower costs with 
better outcomes) in all age ranges, with costs/improved QALYs ranging from 
$2,952/0.32 (older patients) to $11,140/0.43 (younger patients). One-way 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to the input 
variables of cost per rTMS session, monthly prescription drug cost, and the 
number of rTMS sessions per year.
CONCLUSION: rTMS was identified as the dominant therapy compared to 
antidepressant medication trials over the life of the patient across the 
lifespan of adults with MDD, given current costs of treatment. These models 
support the use of rTMS after a single failed antidepressant medication trial 
versus further attempts at medication treatment in adults with MDD.

Mucolipidosis type II (I-Cell disease) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal 
disorder, resulting from functional deficiency of lysosomal enzymes due to an 
impaired targeting of the enzymes to lysosomes, which leads to an abnormal cell 
architecture and the overflow of lysosomal enzymes into the body fluids. The 
life expectancy of the patients is poor, with multisystem deterioration leading 
to death in early childhood. According to the available reports, patients with 
I-cell disease do not survive beyond the first decade of life. Here, we describe 
and illustrate various radiological-musculoskeletal manifestations of a rare 
case of mucolipidosis II who has been a survivor up to now, 20 years old. The 
course of her disease has been complicated by early severe visual compromise due 
to optic nerve swelling, hearing loss and mitral valve regurgitation/stenosis, 
bilateral carpal tunnel, and severe growth impairment. Our case demonstrates 
several skeletal features of dysostosis multiplex. At the age of 20, she is 
wheelchair bound and her medical course is complicated by recurrent pneumonia, 
treated with multiple hospitalizations, antibiotics, and BiPAP. She is on 
outpatient palliative care, Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Management of gastrointestinal complications in hereditary transthyretin 
amyloidosis: a single-center experience over 40 years.

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRm amyloidosis) is a rare disease 
caused by the deposition and accumulation of insoluble non-native transthyretin 
fibrils in the body. The disease inevitably results in widespread organ 
disruption, and poor life expectancy. The GI tract is one organ system 
vulnerable to disruption and, although the clinical presentation of the disease 
varies, GI involvement affects most patients with ATTRm amyloidosis. Areas 
covered: This article presents our experience with diagnosing and treating the 
GI symptoms of ATTRm amyloidosis patients at our center over the last 40 years, 
in the Swedish clustering area of the disease. Our aim is to help other 
physicians to better manage GI complications in patients with this rare but 
widespread condition. Expert commentary: GI symptoms are debilitating 
complications for ATTRm amyloidosis patients to experience, yet with the 
appropriate questioning and diagnosis methods, symptomatic treatments of these 
symptoms can be implemented to provide relief. Further, patients with fewer GI 
complications and a good nutritional status are also better candidates for liver 
transplantation which, in selected cases, is the best disease-modifying 
treatment of ATTRm amyloidosis to date.

OBJECTIVE: In Japan, the number of elderly individuals living alone is 
continuing to increase as society ages. Although studies have considered quality 
of life, life expectancy, and gender differences in elderly individuals living 
alone, only a few have considered the health and lifestyle of these individuals. 
Therefore, we aimed to investigate the factors that affect the self-rated health 
of elderly individuals living alone to understand this group and how best to 
offer them support.
RESULTS: We include 113 individuals. There was a significant difference 
(P < 0.05) in some characteristics (e.g., age, chronic illness, frequency of 
hospital visits in 1 month, and caregivers), activities of daily living (e.g., 
motor tasks), and instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., household 
affairs, heavy housework, outdoor household, and outdoor activities).

BACKGROUND: With the rise in life expectancy, the burden of chronic diseases, 
including obstructive pulmonary diseases, has increased throughout the world.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sales trends of inhaler pharmaceuticals.
METHODS: The changes in box sales and sales amounts (in Turkish lira) of inhaler 
pharmaceuticals during the period 1998 to 2015 were examined and sales were 
projected for the next 3 years. Pharmaceuticals were classified according to 
form and pharmacological groups.
RESULTS: The sales of inhaler pharmaceuticals have increased rapidly since 2008. 
The fastest increase in consumption has occurred in short-acting β2 agonist 
preparations and nebulizer pharmaceuticals. Inhaled corticosteroid and 
long-acting β2 agonist combination sales have been the highest since 2002, when 
these products entered the Turkish market.
CONCLUSIONS: The inhaler pharmaceutical market has grown over the years, and 
this growth will continue in the future. The increased use of short-acting 
preparations, which should be used as symptom relievers, indicates that 
treatment management continues to be inadequate.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir (SOF) + ribavirin 
(RBV), SOF + daclatasvir (DCV), and SOF + ledipasvir (LDV) + RBV compared with 
SOF + pegylated interferon alfa (pegIFN) + RBV in the treatment of patients 
infected with hepatitis C virus in Egypt.
METHODS: Two Markov models were developed on the basis of the Egyptian clinical 
data and practice and were derived from published sources. The clinical 
parameters were derived from two sources: the Egypt multicenter national 
treatment program and previously published randomized clinical trials. The 
utility of the health states was derived using the available published data. 
Direct medical costs were obtained from the National Liver Institute database.
RESULTS: In noncirrhotic patients, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US 
$2330 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the SOF + LDV + RBV, -US 
$9043/QALY for the SOF + DCV, and -US $1332/QALY for the SOF + RBV regimens were 
yielded. In cirrhotic patients, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of -US 
$4170/QALY gained for the SOF + LDV + RBV, -US $9515/QALY for the SOF + DCV, and 
-US $2289/QALY for the SOF + RBV regimens were yielded. The SOF + DCV regimen 
was the most cost-saving option for cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses remain robust.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that the SOF + DCV regimen among other 
currently available regimens is the most cost-saving option that yields the most 
favorable future health economic outcomes compared with the SOF + pegIFN + RBV 
regimen across a broad spectrum of patients, including those with cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major burden 
on individuals and health care systems. The Extension for Community Healthcare 
Outcomes (Project ECHO) enables primary care providers to deliver best-practice 
care for complex conditions to underserved populations. The US Congress passed 
the ECHO Act in late 2016, requiring the Department of Health and Human Services 
to investigate the model. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess 
diagnosis and treatment of HCV infection in a primary care patient panel with 
and without the implementation of Project ECHO.
METHODS: We used Markov models to simulate disease progression, quality of life, 
and life expectancy among individuals with HCV infection and for the general 
population. Data from the University of New Mexico's ECHO operation for HCV show 
an increase in treatment rates. Corresponding increases in survival,
