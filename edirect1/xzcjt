BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) complicates many neoplasms and its 
incidence is expected to rise in parallel with the aging population and longer 
survival of cancer patients. Although a clear consensus exists on indwelling 
catheters in patients with poor performance status, no study has hitherto 
compared different devices in patients requiring temporary or definitive 
drainage following talc poudrage.
METHODS: This is a prospective, two-arm, pilot study on patients with MPE 
undergoing talc poudrage, comparing two different catheters (PleurX® versus 
Pleurocath®) positioned because of the inefficacy of the procedure or the high 
risk of short-term failure. End points of the study were quality of life (QoL), 
median dyspnea and chest pain assessment by EORTC questionnaires and a 100 mm 
visual analog scale, total in-hospital length of stay and frequency of serious 
adverse events.
RESULTS: No difference was observed between the two groups in in mean dyspnea 
and mean chest pain in any questions of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 
questionnaires. Duration of the procedure was significantly longer in the 
PleurX® group versus the Pleurocath® group (72±33 versus 44±13 minutes; P=0.03). 
No difference was observed between the two groups in total length of hospital 
stay (P=1.00) or complication rate (P=1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: For the cohort of patients still needing indwelling pleural 
catheters (PC) after thoracoscopic talc poudrage, PleurX® is suggested when 
drain removal is unlikely due to short life expectancy or the high chance of 
pleurodesis failure. Conversely, Pleurocath® should be recommended in all other 
patients as it is faster to place and easier to remove.

Clinical Lipidology and the Prevention of Vascular Disease: Time for 
Personalized Therapy.

Genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle modifications can cause elevations of 
lipoproteins that contribute to atherosclerotic lesions over time. In the modern 
world with life extension from many improvements in medicine and public health, 
most humans live long enough to develop atherosclerosis with concentrations of 
blood plasma lipoproteins that are very common. Familial abnormalities are 
prevalent and provide additional challenges in identifying unhealthy but 
treatable values of low-density (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). 
Multiple community studies and clinical trials have provided guidance on 
selecting targets and new tools that make possible effective goals of treatment. 
Lipid-lowering drugs are making it possible to achieve those goals and place 
responsibility on physicians to master the art of preventing atherosclerotic 
events. Lipoprotein management remains a very focused effort and requires an 
artful individualized approach for each patient. Few skills are more important 
for healthcare providers in primary care and cardiovascular medicine.

BACKGROUND/AIM: In the era of direct-acting antivirals (DAA), active screening 
for hidden hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is important for HCV elimination. 
This study estimated the cost-effectiveness and health-related outcomes of HCV 
screening and DAA treatment of a targeted population in Korea, where anti-HCV 
prevalence was 0.6% in 2015.
METHODS: A Markov model simulating the natural history of HCV infection was used 
to examine the cost-effectiveness of two strategies: no screening vs screening 
and DAA treatment. Screening was performed by integration of the anti-HCV test 
into the National Health Examination Program. From a healthcare system's 
perspective, the cost-utility and the impact on HCV-related health events of 
one-time anti-HCV screening and DAA treatment in Korean population aged 
40-65 years was analysed with a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: The HCV screening and DAA treatment strategy increased quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) by 0.0015 at a cost of $11.27 resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $7435 per QALY gained compared with no 
screening. The probability of the screening strategy to be cost-effective was 
98.8% at a willingness-to-pay of $27 205. Deterministic sensitivity analyses 
revealed the ICERs were from $4602 to $12 588 and sensitive to screening costs, 
discount rates and treatment acceptability. Moreover, it can prevent 32 
HCV-related deaths, 19 hepatocellular carcinomas and 15 decompensated cirrhosis 
per 100 000 screened persons.
CONCLUSIONS: A one-time HCV screening and DAA treatment of a Korean population 
aged 40-65 years would be highly cost-effective, and significantly reduce the 
HCV-related morbidity and mortality compared with no screening.

Regression after subtotal resection of an optic pathway glioma in an adult 
without adjuvant therapy: case report.

Hidalgo ET, McQuinn MW, Wisoff JH.

Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are relatively common and benign lesions in 
children; however, in adults these lesions are nearly always malignant and hold 
a very poor prognosis. In this report the authors present the case of an adult 
patient with a benign OPG who underwent subtotal resection without adjuvant 
therapy and has had no tumor progression for more than 20 years. A 50-year-old 
woman presented with a 2-year history of personality changes, weight gain, and a 
few months of visual disturbances. Ophthalmological evaluation showed incomplete 
right homonymous hemianopsia. MRI demonstrated a 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5-cm enhancing 
left-sided lesion involving the hypothalamus with extension into the suprasellar 
cistern, extending along the left optic tract and anterior to the level of the 
optic chiasm. A biopsy procedure revealed a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. A 
subtotal resection of approximately 80% of the tumor was performed. 
Postoperatively, the patient experienced complete resolution of her personality 
changes, and her weight decreased back to baseline. Ophthalmological examination 
showed increased right homonymous hemianopsia. In the years following her 
surgery, there was a spontaneous decrease in tumor size without adjuvant 
therapy. The patient continues to have an excellent quality of life despite a 
visual field defect, and no further tumor growth has been observed.

BACKGROUND: The Philippine government has an extensive network of 513 Animal 
Bite Treatment Centers (ABTCs) to supply rabies post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), 
reaching over 1 million bite victims in 2016. The network was evaluated using a 
review of existing national and provincial data, key informant interviews and 
surveys in sample ABTCs to determine the cost-effectiveness of this network in 
preventing human rabies deaths.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: One urban and one rural ABTC in each of 
three selected provinces were studied in more detail. PEP delivery generally 
followed national guidance based on best practices, but there was evidence of 
operational challenges in supplying all ABTCs with adequate biologics and 
recently trained staff. Funding was contributed by different levels of 
government and in some clinics, patients paid for a significant fraction of the 
total cost. From a health provider perspective including both fixed and variable 
costs, the average PEP course delivered cost USD 32.91 /patient across urban 
ABTCs (with higher patient throughput) and USD 57.21 /patient across rural 
ABTCs. These costs suggests that PEP provision in the Philippines cost USD 37.6 
million in 2016, with a cost per life saved of USD 8,290. An analysis of the 
2,239 suspected rabies deaths from 2008 to 2016 showed no significant decline, 
and from 2014-16 an average of 8,534 years of life were lost annually. The 
incidence of rabies deaths from 2014-16 was not clearly related to the provision 
of ABTCs (per 100,000 population) or human population density, but deaths were 
more common in higher income provinces.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In the context of comprehensive rabies control 
(including dog vaccination and public awareness) ways to reduce this high 
expenditure on PEP should be explored, to most cost-effectively reach the 
elimination of human rabies deaths. This paper is accompanied by another 
containing data on the operation of ABTCs network from a patient perspective.

Complexity of the relationship between life expectancy and overlap of lifespans.

Longevity has long been recognised as a key facilitator of reciprocal altruism 
because repeated cooperation of partners hinges on mutual survival. Although 
demographic tools can be used to quantify mutual survival and expected 
overlapping lifespans, studies on the evolutionary theory of cooperation take 
only limited advantage of demography. Overlap of lifespans depends on variation 
in survival across ages and can be high or low independently of high or low life 
expectancies. Here we develop formal demographic measures to study the complex 
relationships between shared life expectancy of two birth cohort peers, the 
proportion of their lives that they can expect to overlap, and longevity. We 
simulate age-specific mortality schedules using a Siler model to reveal how 
infant and senescent mortality, along with age-independent mortality, affect the 
relationship between the proportion of life shared and life expectancy. We find 
that while the proportion of life shared can vary vastly for similar life 
expectancies, almost all changes to mortality schedules that result in higher 
life expectancies also result in higher proportions of life shared. A distinct 
exception occurs if life expectancy increases due to lowering the rate of 
senescence. In this case the proportion of life shared decreases. Our work shows 
that almost all selective pressures that result in higher life expectancies also 
result in a larger proportion of life shared. Therefore, selective forces that 
extend life also improve the chances that a cooperative system would be stable 
in terms of reciprocal interactions. Since reciprocal interactions may also 
reduce mortality and result in a feedback loop with the evolution of longevity, 
our measures and findings can be used for future cross-species comparisons that 
aim to disentangle predecessor and successor in the evolution of longevity and 
cooperation.

BACKGROUND: Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a cancer of the lymphatic system, and 
involves the lymph nodes, spleen and other organs such as the liver, lung, bone 
or bone marrow, depending on the tumour stage. With cure rates of up to 90%, HL 
is one of the most curable cancers worldwide. Approximately 10% of people with 
HL will be refractory to initial treatment or will relapse; this is more common 
in people with advanced stage or bulky disease. Standard of care for these 
people is high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT), but only 55% of participants treated with high-dose chemotherapy and 
ASCT are free from treatment failure at three years, with an overall survival 
(OS) of about 80% at three years.Checkpoint inhibitors that target the 
interaction of the programmed death (PD)-1 immune checkpoint receptor, and its 
ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, have shown remarkable activity in a wide range of 
malignancies. Nivolumab is an anti-(PD)-1 monoclonal antibody and currently 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of 
melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and, since 2016, for 
classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) after treatment with ASCT and brentuximab 
vedotin.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL 
(irrespective of stage of disease).
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, International 
Pharmaceutical Abstracts, conference proceedings and six study registries from 
January 2000 to May 2018 for prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospectively planned trials evaluating 
nivolumab in adults with HL. We excluded trials in which less than 80% of 
participants had HL, unless the trial authors provided the subgroup data for 
these participants in the publication or after we contacted the trial authors.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data 
and assessed potential risk of bias. We used the software RobotReviewer to 
extract data and compared results with our findings. As we did not identify any 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs, we did not meta-analyse data.
MAIN RESULTS: Our search found 782 potentially relevant references. From these, 
we included three trials without a control group, with 283 participants. In 
addition, we identified 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are 
randomised. Risk of bias of the three included studies was moderate to high. All 
of the participants were in relapsed stage, most of them were heavily pretreated 
and had received at least two previous treatments, most of them had also 
undergone ASCT. As we did not identify any RCTs, we could not use the software 
RobotReviewer to assess risk of bias. The software identified correctly that one 
study was not an RCT and did not extract any trial data, but extracted 
characteristics of the other two studies (although also not RCTs) in a 
sufficient way.Two studies with 260 participants evaluated OS. After six months, 
OS was 100% in one study and median OS (the timepoint when only 50% of 
participants were alive) was not reached in the other trial after a median 
follow-up of 18 months (interquartile range (IQR) 15 to 22 months) (very low 
certainty evidence, due to observational trial design, heterogenous patient 
population in terms of pretreatments and various follow-up times (downgrading by 
1 point)). In one study, one out of three cohorts reported quality of life. It 
was unclear whether there was an effect on quality of life as only a subset of 
participants filled out the follow-up questionnaire (very low certainty 
evidence). Three trials (283 participants) evaluated progression-free survival 
(PFS) (very low certainty evidence). Six-month PFS ranged between 60% and 86%, 
and median PFS ranged between 12 and 18 months. All three trials (283 
participants) reported complete response rates, ranging from 12% to 29%, 
depending on inclusion criteria and participants' previous treatments (very low 
certainty evidence).One trial (243 participants) reported drug-related grade 3 
or 4 adverse events (AEs) only after a median follow-up of 18 months (IQR 15 to 
22 months); these were fatigue (23%), diarrhoea (15%), infusion reactions (14%) 
and rash (12%). The other two trials (40 participants) reported 23% to 52% grade 
3 or 4 AEs after six months' follow-up (very low certainty evidence). Only one 
trial (243 participants) reported drug-related serious AEs; 2% of participants 
developed infusion reactions and 1% pneumonitis (very low certainty 
evidence).None of the studies reported treatment-related mortality.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To date, data on OS, quality of life, PFS, response rate, 
or short- and long-term AEs are available from small uncontrolled trials only. 
The three trials included heavily pretreated participants, which had previously 
undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. For these participants, median OS was not 
reached after follow-up times of at least 16 months (more than 50% of 
participants with a limited life expectancy were alive at this timepoint). Only 
one cohort out of three only reported quality of life, with limited follow-up 
data so that meaningful conclusions were not possible. Serious adverse events 
occurred rarely. Currently, data are too sparse to make a clear statement on 
nivolumab for people with relapsed or refractory HL except for heavily 
pretreated people, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. When 
interpreting these results, it is important to consider that proper RCTs should 
confirm these findings.As there are 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of 
which two are RCTs, it is possible that an update of this review will be 
published in the near future and that this update will show different results to 
those reported here.

INTRODUCTION: Common iliac aneurysms are present in up to 40% of abdominal 
aortic aneurysms and frequently impair distal landing zones for endovascular 
aneurysm repair. Several techniques have been developed in order to overcome 
these issues, with different applications and conflicting results. Although 
long-term outcomes of hypogastric exclusion are favorable, the risks of pelvic 
ischemia and morbidity rates are high. We aim to review current hypogastric 
preservation strategies used in the endovascular treatment of aortoiliac 
aneurysms.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A thorough non-systematic review of the literature was 
conducted using PubMed/Medline. Forty-five articles were included, according to 
their scientific relevance and relation with the subject.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The bell-bottom technique can be used in common iliac 
arteries with up to 24 mm of diameter. Although apparently effective in the 
short-term, long-term durability is questionable with reported type 1b endoleak 
rates varying from 3.4-7.8% and high reintervention rates reported. Iliac 
branches have better long-term outcomes, with 90.4% patency rates and 91.8% 
freedom from re-intervention at 10 years' follow-up. Nonetheless, its widespread 
application is limited by complex anatomies and increased costs. Finally, 
parallel graft techniques are an effective option for hostile anatomies 
unsuitable for other techniques. Endoleak due to gutter development remains the 
biggest limitation for its long-term durability and solid evidence regarding its 
application is still lacking.
CONCLUSIONS: When determining the appropriate hypogastric preservation strategy, 
several factors should be considered. Anatomic criteria, life expectancy as well 
as physical and sexual activity are the most important criteria. Procedure 
complexity and cost should also be accounted for.

BACKGROUND: Persistent seizures are associated with physical injury, reduced 
quality of life, and psychosocial impairment. Perampanel is approved for the 
adjunctive treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of perampanel as 
adjunctive therapy to other antiepileptic drugs (AED) compared with AED 
maintenance therapy alone for the treatment of PGTCS.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model for PGTCS where transitions were based on 
treatment response rates. The analysis was conducted over a 33-year time horizon 
from the Spanish National Health Service (NHS) and societal perspectives. 
Efficacy data were derived from clinical studies. Resource use, market shares, 
costs, and utilities were obtained from Kantar Health's National Health and 
Wellness Survey. Drug costs were obtained from the Consejo General de Colegios 
Oficiales de Farmacéuticos. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis from the NHS perspective, perampanel was 
associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
€16,557/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) relative to AED maintenance therapy 
for the treatment of PGTCS. Incremental costs were €5475 and incremental QALYs 
were 0.33. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the ICERs were strongly influenced 
by discounting rate for costs and health effects, with little influence of other 
parameters, including perampanel cost and utilities. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses, the probability of perampanel being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000/QALY was 89.3%. From the societal 
perspective, perampanel provided a cost-savings of €5288 per patient compared 
with AED maintenance therapy alone.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that perampanel is likely to be a 
cost-effective option.

Influence of elevated CO(2) on development and food utilization of armyworm 
Mythimna separata fed on transgenic Bt maize infected by nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria.

USA.

BACKGROUND: Bt crops will face a new ecological risk of reduced effectiveness 
against target-insect pests owing to the general decrease in exogenous-toxin 
content in Bt crops grown under elevated carbon dioxide (CO2). The method chosen 
to deal with this issue may affect the sustainability of transgenic crops as an 
effective pest management tool, especially under future atmospheric CO2 level 
raising.
METHODS: In this study, rhizobacterias, as being one potential biological 
regulator to enhance nitrogen utilization efficiency of crops, was selected and 
the effects of Bt maize (Line IE09S034 with Cry1Ie vs. its parental line of 
non-Bt maize Xianyu 335) infected by Azospirillum brasilense (AB) and 
Azotobacter chroococcum (AC) on the development and food utilization of the 
target Mythimna separate under ambient and double-ambient CO2 in open-top 
chambers from 2016 to 2017.
RESULTS: The results indicated that rhizobacteria infection significantly 
increased the larval life-span, pupal duration, relative consumption rate and 
approximate digestibility of M. separata, and significantly decreased the 
pupation rate, pupal weight, adult longevity, fecundity, relative growth rate, 
efficiency of conversion of digested food and efficiency of conversion of 
ingested food of M. separata fed on Bt maize, while here were opposite trends in 
development and food utilization of M. separata fed on non-Bt maize infected 
with AB and AC compared with the control buffer in 2016 and 2017 regardless of 
CO2 level.
DISCUSSION: Simultaneously, elevated CO2 and Bt maize both had negative 
influence on the development and food utilization of M. separata. Presumably, 
CO2 concentration arising in future significantly can increase their intake of 
food and harm to maize crop; however, Bt maize infected with rhizobacterias can 
reduce the field hazards from M. separata and the application of rhizobacteria 
infection can enhance the resistance of Bt maize against target lepidoptera 
pests especially under elevated CO2.

BACKGROUND: In a phase 2 short-term (6 months) study of patients with congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion 
(CSHI) was found to be a safe, effective and well-tolerated method of replacing 
cortisol with improved disease and patient-related outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term CSHI.
DESIGN: Single-centre, open-label, phase 2 extension study.
PATIENTS: Five adults with classic CAH.
MEASUREMENTS: Biomarkers of disease control, metabolic indices and 
health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) estimates.
RESULTS: Six of eight patients chose to continue on long-term CSHI therapy. 
Compared to baseline, eighteen months of CSHI resulted in decreased (P = 0.043) 
0700-hour ACTH, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione and progesterone; 
increased whole-body lean mass (P = 0.024); and improved HRQoL, especially 
symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (P = 0.003). Findings at six and eighteen 
months did not differ, and improvements achieved in androgen control, lean body 
mass and HRQoL after 6 months of CSHI were maintained at eighteen months. The 
hydrocortisone dose appeared to decrease with time [6 vs 18 months: 38.3 ± 8.8 
vs 33.6 ± 12.2 mg/day (P = 0.062)], especially in women receiving oral 
contraceptives. Reduction of testicular adrenal rest and adrenal size observed 
at 6 months remained stable. In one patient, an adrenal adenoma continually 
decreased over time. Subjective improvement in hirsutism was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of CSHI is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option 
in a select set of adults with classic CAH. Improvements observed short term in 
disease control and subjective health status continued long term.

Introduction: Poorly controlled severe eosinophilic asthma is difficult and 
costly to manage. Reslizumab, an add-on treatment for adults with severe 
eosinophilic asthma, reduces the number of exacerbations and improves the 
quality of life (QoL). The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of reslizumab. Methods: A Markov model was used to compare 
the cost-effectiveness of add-on reslizumab with the standard-of-care (SOC) from 
the US societal perspective over a five-year time horizon. Efficacy and safety 
inputs for the model were based on data from two clinical trials (NCT01287039 
and NCT01285323). Other model inputs, including mortality rates, costs, and 
utility, were estimated from literature, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). One-way, threshold, and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed. Adherence, treatment response, and 
the placebo effect were evaluated in separate scenario analyses. Results: The 
base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $697 403 (2017 USD) 
per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). In the PSA, reslizumab becomes 
cost-effective in 50% of the iterations at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold 
of $689 000. The model is most sensitive to the QoL improvement with reslizumab 
treatment in the one-way and threshold analyses. The response and adherence 
models had lower ICERs than the base model but still above $500 000. The ICER of 
the placebo effect model was $29 820. Conclusions: The improvement in QoL and 
exacerbation rates with reslizumab are associated with high costs, making 
reslizumab unlikely to be cost-effective at the $200 000 WTP threshold.

Neuropsychiatric disorders were ranked third as contributors to 
disability-adjusted life-years in South Africa (SA). Despite this high 
morbidity, mental health is often overlooked on the public health agenda. This 
article reviews evidence on the burden of mental illness in the Western Cape 
Province of SA, as well as current provincial interventions to decrease the 
burden of mental illness. Available evidence supports the need for improved 
integration of mental health services in primary healthcare and strengthening of 
community services. Challenges include a lack of capacity due to staff shortages 
and inadequate availability and allocation of resources. Evidence from large 
epidemiological studies to quantify the burden of disease as well as 
cost-effectiveness studies of interventions are required to successfully plan 
and implement interventions. Similar reviews may provide a national overview of 
mental health issues as well as allow improvement through better understanding 
of research and best practices in various provinces.

OBJECTIVES: Death certificates are an important source of information for 
understanding life expectancy and mortality trends; however, misclassification 
and incompleteness are common. Although deaths caused by Legionnaires' disease 
might be identified through routine surveillance, it is unclear whether 
Legionnaires' disease is accurately recorded on death certificates. We evaluated 
the sensitivity and positive predictive value of death certificates for 
identifying deaths from confirmed or suspected Legionnaires' disease among 
adults in New York City.
METHODS: We deterministically matched death certificate data from January 1, 
2008, through December 31, 2013, on New York City residents aged ≥18 years to 
surveillance data on confirmed and suspected cases of Legionnaires' disease from 
January 1, 2008, through October 31, 2013. We estimated sensitivity and positive 
predictive value by using surveillance data as the reference standard.
RESULTS: Of 294 755 deaths, 27 (<0.01%) had an underlying cause of death of 
Legionnaires' disease and 33 (0.01%) had any mention of Legionnaires' disease on 
the death certificate. Of 1211 confirmed or suspected cases of Legionnaires' 
disease, 267 (22.0%) matched to a record in the death certificate data set. The 
sensitivity of death certificates that listed Legionnaires' disease as the 
underlying cause of death was 17.3% and of death certificates with any mention 
of Legionnaires' disease was 20.9%. The positive predictive value of death 
certificates that listed Legionnaires' disease as the underlying cause of death 
was 70.4% and of death certificates with any mention of Legionnaires' disease 
was 69.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Death certificates had limited ability to identify confirmed or 
suspected deaths with Legionnaires' disease. Provider trainings on the diagnosis 
of Legionnaires' disease, particularly hospital settings, and proper completion 
of death certificates might improve the sensitivity of death certificates for 
people who die of Legionnaires' disease.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) are developing a joint methodology for estimating the 
national and global work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO joint 
methodology), with contributions from a large network of experts. In this paper, 
we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating 
the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke attributable 
to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO 
joint methodology.
OBJECTIVES: We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to 
long working hours (called Systematic Review 1 in the protocol) and 
systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of long working 
hours on stroke (called Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide 
systematic review methodology as an organizing framework, conducting both 
systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way.
DATA SOURCES: Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search 
electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published 
and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and 
PsychINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet 
search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of 
previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional 
experts.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA: We will include working-age (≥15 years) workers 
in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but 
exclude children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 
1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of 
occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and 
≥55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, 
in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized 
controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized 
intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of a relevant level 
of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to stroke, compared 
with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40 h/week).
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: At least two review authors will 
independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a 
first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, 
followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review 
authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most 
suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will 
combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the 
guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for 
Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2. PROSPERO registration 
number: CRD42017060124.

Violence in Colombia and Mexico: trend and impact on life expectancy of homicide 
mortality between 1998 and 2015.

Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO), Mexico City, Mexico. Electronic address:

Mexico.

OBJECTIVES: Colombia is considered one of the most violent countries in the 
world even though homicide mortality has decreased since 2002. Mexico's homicide 
rate has tripled since 2008, after a period of decreasing mortality; this fact 
has been compared with Colombia in the 1990s and defined as a 'Colombianization' 
of violence in Mexico. We analyzed and compared the trend and impact of homicide 
mortality in Colombia and Mexico between 1998 and 2015.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study.
METHODS: We calculated the standardized mortality rates and the years of life 
lost using data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography in 
Mexico and the National Management Department of Statistics in Colombia. We used 
the joinpoint regression analysis to identify significant changes in the 
mortality trend.
RESULTS: During the 1990s, Colombia reached the highest homicide mortality rates 
in the world, but these rates have since decreased significantly. In Mexico, 
homicide mortality had a decreasing trend from 1998 to 2007; however, since 
2008, the rate grew significantly, and although mortality tended to decrease 
after reaching its peak in 2011, a slight upturn was observed in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the trend in mortality in both countries has had 
certain similarities, such as the increase in mortality after the implementation 
of antidrug policies and the subsequent decrease; however, the political 
processes, the level of mortality reached, its impact on life expectancy, and 
its distribution by gender are dissimilar. We consider speaking of a 
'Colombianization' of violence in Mexico to be inaccurate.

Putting People First: Critical Reforms for Canada's Health Care System.

Pai M, Schipper H, Swain H.

For over 70 years, since the Dominion Provincial Conferences at the end of the 
Second World War, Canadians have viewed health care as a right of citizenship. 
The Canada Health Act (CHA, 1984) formally entrenched the five principles that 
guide our current publicly operated, single payer, provincially managed system: 
public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability and 
accessibility. The health care system that has sprung up around the CHA has 
become increasingly complex, costly and strained. Our gradual descent through 
the rankings of major health care suggests that we are reaching the limits of 
what the current health care system can provide. Unfortunately, constructive 
political debate around this issue is often choked by intense ideological 
positioning. System reform is urgently needed to address the rapidly changing 
biological and demographic drivers of health. We do not feel that diverting ever 
larger flows of money into the status quo is a sustainable solution. Our 
nation's health and the means to advance it must be seen as assets rather than 
costs. We believe it is possible to meet increasing demands by expanding the 
supply and acknowledging the wealth of resources (scientific, human, managerial 
and educational) that we currently possess. In this paper we propose a cultural 
shift from an institution-centered system bent on cost control, to a 
patient-centered system that fosters a true health economy. We identify a series 
of interventions (some bold and others less so) to achieve a clear and evaluable 
goal: maximizing the well-being and debility-free life expectancy of each 
individual. To achieve a patient-centred system-we discuss strategies to address 
costs and utilization, the setting of real performance standards, the 
elimination of conflicts of interest and the provision of truly accessible care 
for all Canadians. To create a health economy, we discuss the importance of 
innovation, the need for a reinvigorated public health system and steps to 
overhaul the health care human resources environment. The goal of health care 
reform in Canada should be a system that is dynamic, evidence based, wealth 
creating and a global leader. We believe that, with leadership and vision, this 
goal is eminently achievable.

Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To determine what thresholds are most often cited in the 
cost-effectiveness literature for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), 
given various recommendations proposed and used in the literature to date, and 
thereafter to assess whether studies appropriately justified their use of 
threshold values.
METHODS: We reviewed the contents of the Tufts Medical Center Global Health 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, a repository of all English language 
cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year averted studies indexed in PubMed. Our 
review included all catalogued cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year studies 
published from 2000 through 2015. We restricted attention to studies that 
investigated interventions in LMICs.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified 381 studies (80%) focused on LMICs. Of these 
studies, 250 (66%) cited the World Health Organization's 1 to 3 times gross 
domestic product per capita threshold. A full-text review of 60 (24%) of these 
articles (randomly selected) revealed that none justified use of this threshold 
in the particular country or countries studied beyond citing (generic) guideline 
documents.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis can help inform health care spending, 
but its value depends on incorporating assumptions that are valid for the 
applicable setting. Rather than rely on commonly used, generic economic 
thresholds, we encourage authors to use context-specific thresholds that reflect 
local preferences.
