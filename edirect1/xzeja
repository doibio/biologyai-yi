anti-inflammatory potential was assessed using lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated macrophages. The effect on cell migration was disclosed using 
scratch wound assay. Lipogenesis was induced using T0901317, hyperpigmentation 
with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (IBMX) and senescence with etoposide. Our 
results show that the EO was characterized mainly by α-pinene and limonene. The 
EO was able to decrease nitric oxide (NO) release as well as iNOS and pro-IL-1β 
protein levels. The EO promoted wound healing while decreasing lipogenesis and 
having depigmenting effects. The EO also reduced senescence-associated 
β-galactosidase, p21/p53 protein levels and the nuclear accumulation of γH2AX. 
Overall, our study highlights the properties of F. lutea EO that make it a 
compelling candidate for dermocosmetics applications.

The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019 reveals an increasing prevalence 
of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) from 1990 to 2019. This study delves into the 
role of dietary risk factors across different demographic and socioeconomic 
groups. Utilizing data from the GBD 2019, it analyzes age-adjusted T2DM 
metrics-death counts, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and 
Age-Standardized Rates (ASRs)-stratified by age, sex, and region. The study 
employed Estimated Annual Percentage Changes (EAPCs) to track trends over time. 
The results show that in 2019, 26.07% of T2DM mortality and 27.08% of T2DM DALYs 
were attributable to poor diets, particularly those low in fruits and high in 
red and processed meats. There was a marked increase in both the death rate and 
DALY rate associated with dietary risks over this period, indicating the 
significant impact of dietary factors on the global T2DM landscape. Geographic 
variations in T2DM trends were significant, with regions like Southern 
Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia experiencing the most substantial increases 
in Age-Standardized Mortality Rate (ASMR) and Age-Standardized DALY Rate (ASDR). 
A positive correlation was noted between Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) and T2DM 
burden due to dietary risk factors. The study concludes that targeted public 
health initiatives promoting dietary changes could substantially reduce the 
global T2DM burden.

The global burden of cancer is increasing rapidly, and nanomedicine offers 
promising prospects for enhancing the life expectancy of cancer patients. Janus 
nanoparticles (JNPs) have garnered considerable attention due to their 
asymmetric geometry, enabling multifunctionality in drug delivery and 
theranostics. However, achieving precise control over the self-assembly of JNPs 
in solution at the nanoscale level poses significant challenges. Herein, a 
low-temperature reversed-phase microemulsion system was used to obtain 
homogenous Mn3O4-Ag2S JNPs, which showed significant potential in cancer 
theranostics. Structural characterization revealed that the Ag2S (5-10 nm) part 
was uniformly deposited on a specific surface of Mn3O4 to form a Mn3O4-Ag2S 
Janus morphology. Compared to the single-component Mn3O4 and Ag2S particles, the 
fabricated Mn3O4-Ag2S JNPs exhibited satisfactory biocompatibility and 
therapeutic performance. Novel diagnostic and therapeutic nanoplatforms can be 
guided using the magnetic component in JNPs, which is revealed as an excellent 
T1 contrast enhancement agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with multiple 
functions, such as photo-induced regulation of the tumor microenvironment via 
producing reactive oxygen species and second near-infrared region (NIR-II) 
photothermal excitation for in vitro tumor-killing effects. The prime 
antibacterial and promising theranostics results demonstrate the extensive 
potential of the designed photo-responsive Mn3O4-Ag2S JNPs for biomedical 
applications.

There is growing interest in dietary interventions, particularly gerobiotics, 
that directly target aging. Several single-strain gerobiotics have proven to be 
beneficial in alleviating aging and age-related functional declines across 
species, but multistrain/multispecies gerobiotics have been proven even more 
advantageous due to the potential synergy and additive effects among individual 
isolates. However, there is very limited research on how 
multistrain/multispecies gerobiotic combinations or cocktails extend healthy 
longevity. This study comprehensively analyzed probiotic bacteria from 
traditionally fermented Barnyard millet and compared their efficacy in promoting 
healthy longevity under various combinations using Caenorhabditis elegans. We 
have shown that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved by combining 
gerobiotics, and the effect was found to be strictly strain-specific. Among the 
120 combinations tested, we identified two synergistic gerobiotic combinations, 
cocktail 55 (combination of B. licheniformis PS70, L. delbrueckii subsp. 
bulgaricus PS77, and L. amylovorus PS60) and cocktail 112 (combination of L. 
delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus PS77, L. lactis PS10, and P. pentosaceus PS91), 
extending the mean lifespan of C. elegans by up to 46.2% and 53.1%, 
respectively. Our mechanistic study showed that the life-promoting effect of 
cocktail 55 relied on the p38 MAPK-SKN-1 pathway, while cocktail 112 acted on 
multiple signaling pathways, including IIS, β-catenin, and TGF-β pathways, to 
achieve its impact on the host. Moreover, feeding gerobiotic cocktails improved 
several healthspan markers reported to decline with age. These observations 
showed that the gerobiotic cocktails target different subsets of the gene 
regulatory network controlling the aging process in C. elegans, thereby 
extending healthy longevity.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with diabetes have a higher risk of developing chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). Early detection of CKD through microalbuminuria screening, 
followed by treatment, delays the progression of CKD. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of population-based screening of microalbuminuria among 
normotensive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients aged >40 years compared with no 
screening scenario using a decision tree combined with the Markov model.
METHODS: We considered two scenarios: Scenario I - dipstick microalbuminuria 
followed by spot-urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and serum creatinine in 
sequence; Scenario II - spot urine ACR plus serum creatinine. A mathematical 
cohort of the target population was simulated over a lifetime horizon with an 
annual cycle. Data for the model were obtained from secondary resources. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for screening 
scenarios compared to nonscreening scenario, along with sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The discounted ICER per quality-adjusted life years gained for annual 
microalbuminuria screening in the normotensive diabetic population in India were 
₹ 24,114 (US$ 308) and ₹ 13,790 (US$ 176) for scenarios I and II, respectively. 
Annual screening by scenarios I and II resulted in a reduction of 180 and 193 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases per 100,000 population, respectively, 
resulting in a cost saving of ₹ 12.3 and 13.3 Crore spent on ESRD management 
over 10 years. Both scenarios were also cost-effective even at the screening 
frequencies of 5 and 10 yearly.
CONCLUSION: Microalbuminuria screening was cost-effective at the threshold of 
one-time GDP per capita in India.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia negatively impacts quality of life. It is unclear whether 
different measures of muscle size, strength, physical performance, and fitness 
have similar associations with quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To describe associations of sarcopenia metrics with quality of life 
outcomes.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults aged 70+ years participating in the 
SOMMA (Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging) study.
DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Two academic medical centers.
MEASUREMENTS: Measures included muscle size (MRI- muscle volume. D3Cr muscle 
mass); strength and power (grip strength, leg extension power and strength); 
walking and physical performance (4m and 400m walk, SPPB (Short Physical 
Performance Battery), stair climb, chair stand); fitness (VO2 peak); health 
related quality of life (EQ-5D); and anthropometrics (weight, height, and body 
mass index).Results were stratified by sex. Correlations, scatterplots and 
linear regression models described the association between various measures of 
sarcopenia and fitness with overall quality of life score (EQ5D VAS) as a 
continuous variable. We also quantified differences between sarcopenia and 
fitness measures by overall QOL (Quality of Life) as a categorical variable 
(low, medium, high) and by QOL subcomponents (pain and discomfort, problems with 
usual activities, mobility, anxiety and depression, and problems with self-care) 
using distributionally appropriate methods.
RESULTS: Walking tests and physical performance were most consistently (but 
modestly) associated with overall quality of life (r~0.2, p<.001) and its 
subcomponents. Both men and women several sarcopenia and fitness measures were 
more strongly associated with pain and usual activity than other QOL components.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor performance, lower fitness and lower strength are related to 
worse quality of life, particularly pain, in older adults. Future studies should 
quantify these relationships longitudinally.

BACKGROUND: Establishment of dedicated Stroke Centers has shown to be effective 
on the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke, as well as mechanical 
thrombectomy (MTE) in acute large vessel occlusion. The cost-effectiveness of 
this treatment has also been proven in several countries, but so far not in 
Switzerland.
METHODS: We compare the pathways and economic impact of patients with acute 
large vessel occlusions causing acute ischemic stroke before the establishment 
of the stroke center and MTE in 2016 with the time afterwards in the years 
2016-2020. Local data from the Swiss Stroke Registry and hospital accounting as 
well as economic data from a healthcare insurance company was used for 
evaluation in an economic model. Both payer and societal perspectives were 
considered, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to explore 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Establishment of a new Stroke Center in Central Switzerland increased 
the absolute number of thrombectomies from 0 in 2015 to 55 in 2016 to 83 in 
2020, as well as the percentage of MTE in large vessel occlusions (LVO) from 
50.9% in 2016 to 58.2% in 2020. Over a 15-year horizon, predicted average 
additional costs of CHF 7,978 were associated with the establishment of a new 
stroke center, as well as 0.60 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) per patient 
and an additional survival of 0.59 years per patient. The calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was therefore CHF 13,297 per QALY gained. When societal 
costs were included, the new stroke care model was predicted to dominate the old 
care model. Robustness of model results was confirmed via probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
LIMITATIONS: The results rely on data from a single stroke center and, 
therefore, cannot be generalized.
CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of a new Stroke Center can be cost-effective and 
provide better outcomes in terms of functional independence as well as 
quality-adjusted life-years.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the public health impact and cost effectiveness of 
gender-neutral vaccination (GNV) versus female-only vaccination (FOV) with human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Japan.
METHODS: We modeled the public health impact and cost effectiveness of GNV 
versus FOV to prevent HPV-associated diseases in Japan over the next 100 years. 
We used one-way sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of varying key model 
input parameters and conducted scenario analyses to explore the effects of 
varying the vaccination coverage rate (VCR) of each cohort.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, GNV averted additional cancer cases (17,228 
female/6,033 male) and deaths (1,892 female/1,849 male) compared to FOV. When 
all HPV-associated diseases were considered, GNV had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥4,732,320 (US$35,987)/quality-adjusted life year 
gained compared to FOV. The model was most sensitive to the discount rate and 
the disutility associated with HPV-related diseases. GNV had greater relative 
public health benefits when the female VCR was lower and was cost effective at a 
female VCR of 30%.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate implementation of GNV would reduce the disease burden and 
mortality associated with HPV in Japan, and would be cost effective compared to 
FOV if the female VCR remains low (30%).

Plain Language Summary: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually 
transmitted infection and, in Japan, the prevalence of HPV infection and the 
incidence of its associated diseases are high among both men and women. In the 
present manuscript we modeled the public health impact and cost effectiveness of 
gender-neutral vaccination versus female-only vaccination to prevent 
HPV-associated diseases in Japan over the next 100 years and found that 
immediate implementation of a gender-neutral vaccination strategy would reduce 
the burden and mortality associated with HPV in Japan.

The chemical biology of native nucleic acid modifications has seen an intense 
upswing, first concerning DNA modifications in the field of epigenetics and then 
concerning RNA modifications in a field that was correspondingly rebaptized 
epitranscriptomics by analogy. The German Research Foundation (DFG) has funded 
several consortia with a scientific focus in these fields, strengthening the 
traditionally well-developed nucleic acid chemistry community and inciting it to 
team up with colleagues from the life sciences and data science to tackle 
interdisciplinary challenges. This Perspective focuses on the genesis, 
scientific outcome, and downstream impact of the DFG priority program SPP1784 
and offers insight into how it fecundated further consortia in the field. 
Pertinent research was funded from mid-2015 to 2022, including an extension 
related to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite being a detriment to research 
activity in general, the pandemic has resulted in tremendously boosted interest 
in the field of RNA and RNA modifications as a consequence of their widespread 
and successful use in vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2. Funded principal 
investigators published over 250 pertinent papers with a very substantial impact 
on the field. The program also helped to redirect numerous laboratories toward 
this dynamic field. Finally, SPP1784 spawned initiatives for several funded 
consortia that continue to drive the fields of nucleic acid modification.

This update covers several articles on diagnosis and misdiagnosis of myasthenia 
gravis (MG), the role of complement in MG, and then an impressive number of 
recent treatment trials. There is a negative study on any corticosteroid-sparing 
effect of intravenous immunoglobulin. A number of positive studies are reviewed. 
Open-label extension studies of phase 3 trials showed benefit regarding quality 
of life with efgartigimod and in functional measures with ravulizumab. The phase 
3 RAISE trial of zilucoplan, a self-administered complement C5 inhibitor, is 
covered as well as the MyCarinG trial of rozanolixizumab. The notion of using 
fast-acting therapies early in the course of MG is addressed. The last sections 
center on MG and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome as a consequence of immune 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

BACKGROUND: Prediction models are being increasingly used in clinical practice, 
with some requiring patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The optimal approach to 
collecting the needed inputs is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare mortality prediction model inputs and 
scores based on electronic health record (EHR) abstraction versus patient 
survey.
METHODS: Older patients aged ≥65 years with type 2 diabetes at an urban primary 
care practice in Chicago were recruited to participate in a care management 
trial. All participants completed a survey via an electronic portal that 
included items on the presence of comorbid conditions and functional status, 
which are needed to complete a mortality prediction model. We compared the 
individual data inputs and the overall model performance based on the data 
gathered from the survey compared to the chart review.
RESULTS: For individual data inputs, we found the largest differences in 
questions regarding functional status such as pushing/pulling, where 41.4% 
(31/75) of participants reported difficulties that were not captured in the 
chart with smaller differences for comorbid conditions. For the overall 
mortality score, we saw nonsignificant differences (P=.82) when comparing survey 
and chart-abstracted data. When allocating participants to life expectancy 
subgroups (<5 years, 5-10 years, >10 years), differences in survey and chart 
review data resulted in 20% having different subgroup assignments and, 
therefore, discordant glucose control recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small exploratory study, we found that, despite differences 
in data inputs regarding functional status, the overall performance of a 
mortality prediction model was similar when using survey and chart-abstracted

IMPORTANCE: Pain is challenging for patients with advanced cancer. While recent 
guidelines recommend acupuncture and massage for cancer pain, their comparative 
effectiveness is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of acupuncture and massage on musculoskeletal 
pain among patients with advanced cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter pragmatic randomized clinical 
trial was conducted at US cancer care centers consisting of a northeastern 
comprehensive cancer center and a southeastern cancer institute from September 
19, 2019, through February 23, 2022. The principal investigator and study 
statisticians were blinded to treatment assignments. The duration of follow-up 
was 26 weeks. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed (linear mixed models). 
Participants included patients with advanced cancer with moderate to severe pain 
and clinician-estimated life expectancy of 6 months or more. Patient recruitment 
strategy was multipronged (eg, patient database queries, mailings, referrals, 
community outreach). Eligible patients had English or Spanish as their first 
language, were older than 18 years, and had a Karnofsky score greater than or 
equal to 60 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicating less functional impairment).
INTERVENTIONS: Weekly acupuncture or massage for 10 weeks with monthly booster 
sessions up to 26 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the change in worst pain 
intensity score from baseline to 26 weeks. The secondary outcomes included 
fatigue, insomnia, and quality of life. The Brief Pain Inventory (range, 0-10; 
higher numbers indicate worse pain intensity or interference) was used to 
measure the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included fatigue, insomnia, 
and quality of life.
RESULTS: A total of 298 participants were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [14.1] 
years, 200 [67.1%] were women, 33 [11.1%] Black, 220 [74.1%] White, 46 [15.4%] 
Hispanic, and 78.5% with solid tumors). The mean (SD) baseline worst pain score 
was 6.9 (1.5). During 26 weeks, acupuncture reduced the worst pain score, with a 
mean change of -2.53 (95% CI, -2.92 to -2.15) points, and massage reduced the 
Brief Pain Inventory worst pain score, with a mean change of -3.01 (95% CI, 
-3.38 to -2.63) points; the between-group difference was not significant (-0.48; 
95% CI, -0.98 to 0.03; P = .07). Both treatments also improved fatigue, 
insomnia, and quality of life without significant between-group differences. 
Adverse events were mild and included bruising (6.5% of patients receiving 
acupuncture) and transient soreness (15.1% patients receiving massage).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial among patients with 
advanced cancer, both acupuncture and massage were associated with pain 
reduction and improved fatigue, insomnia, and quality of life over 26 weeks; 
however, there was no significant different between the treatments. More 
research is needed to evaluate how best to integrate these approaches into pain 
treatment to optimize symptom management for the growing population of people 
living with advanced cancer.

Higher Mortality Is Not a Universal Cost of Dispersal: A Case Study in African 
Wild Dogs.

Behr DM, Hodel FH, Cozzi G, McNutt JW, Ozgul A.

AbstractMortality is considered one of the main costs of dispersal. A reliable 
evaluation of mortality, however, is often hindered by a lack of information 
about the fate of individuals that disappear under unexplained circumstances 
(i.e., missing individuals). Here, we addressed this uncertainty by applying a 
Bayesian mortality analysis that inferred the fate of missing individuals 
according to information from individuals with known fate. Specifically, we 
tested the hypothesis that mortality during dispersal is higher than mortality 
among nondispersers using 32 years of mark-resighting data from a free-ranging 
population of the endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) in northern 
Botswana. Contrary to expectations, we found that mortality during dispersal was 
lower than mortality among nondispersers, indicating that higher mortality is 
not a universal cost of dispersal. Our findings suggest that group living can 
incur costs for certain age classes, such as limited access to resources as 
group density increases, that exceed the mortality costs associated with 
dispersal. By challenging the accepted expectation of higher mortality during 
dispersal, we urge for further investigations of this key life history trait and 
propose a robust statistical approach to reduce bias in mortality estimates.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is a substantial burden 
to healthcare systems worldwide. New tools are needed to improve precision of 
treatment by optimizing the balance between efficacy, safety, and cost. We 
developed a high-throughput multi-marker decision support instrument which 
simultaneously quantifies proteins associated with CVD.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Candidate proteins independently associated with different 
clinical outcomes were selected from clinical studies by the screening of 368 
circulating biomarkers. We then custom-designed a quantitative PEA-panel with 21 
proteins (CVD-21) by including recombinant antigens as calibrator samples for 
normalization and absolute quantification of the proteins. The utility of the 
CVD-21 tool was evaluated in plasma samples from a case-control cohort of 4224 
patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) using multivariable Cox regression 
analyses and machine learning techniques. The assays in the CVD-21 tool gave 
good precision and high sensitivity with lower level of determination (LOD) 
between 0.03-0.7 pg/ml for five of the biomarkers. The dynamic range for the 
assays was sufficient to accurately quantify the biomarkers in the validation 
study except for troponin I, which in the modeling was replaced by 
high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-TnT). We created seven different 
multimarker models, including a reference model with NT-proBNP, hs-TnT, GDF-15, 
IL-6, and cystatin C and one model with only clinical variables, for the 
comparison of the discriminative value of the CVD-21 tool. All models with 
biomarkers including hs-TnT provided similar discrimination for all outcomes, 
e.g. c-index between 0.68-0.86 and outperformed models using only clinical 
variables. Most important prognostic biomarkers were MMP-12, U-PAR, REN, VEGF-D, 
FGF-23, TFF3, ADM, and SCF.
CONCLUSIONS: The CVD-21 tool is the very first instrument which with PEA 
simultaneously quantifies 21 proteins with associations to different CVD. Novel 
pathophysiologic and prognostic information beyond that of established 
biomarkers were identified by a number of proteins.

As a potential means for smoking cessation and consequently prevention of 
smoking-related diseases and mortality, in this study, our goal was to 
investigate the inhibition of nicotine metabolism by P450 2A6. Smoking is the 
main cause of many diseases and disabilities and harms nearly every organ of the 
body. As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more 
than 16 million Americans are living with diseases caused by smoking. On 
average, the life expectancy of a smoker is about 10 years less than a 
nonsmoker. Smoking cessation can substantially reduce the incidence of 
smoking-related diseases, including cancer. At least, 70 of the more than 7000 
cigarette smoke components, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 
N-nitrosamines, and aromatic amines, are known carcinogens. Nicotine is the 
compound responsible for the addictive and psychopharmacological effects of 
tobacco. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for the phase I metabolism of 
many tobacco components, including nicotine. Nicotine is mainly metabolized by 
cytochrome P450s 2A6 and 2A13 to cotinine. This metabolism decreases the amount 
of available nicotine in the bloodstream, leading to increased smoking behavior 
and thus exposure to tobacco toxicants and carcinogens. Here, we report the 
syntheses and P450 2A6 inhibitory activities of a number of new flavone-based 
esters and acids. Three of the flavone derivatives studied were found to be 
potent competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Docking studies were used to 
determine the possible mechanisms of the activity of these inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenomic testing to identify variations in genes that 
influence metabolism of antidepressant medications can enhance efficacy and 
reduce adverse effects of pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder. We 
sought to establish the cost-effectiveness of implementing pharmacogenomic 
testing to guide prescription of antidepressants.
METHODS: We developed a discrete-time microsimulation model of care pathways for 
major depressive disorder in British Columbia, Canada, to evaluate the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomic testing from the public 
payer's perspective over 20 years. The model included unique patient 
characteristics (e.g., metabolizer phenotypes) and used estimates derived from 
systematic reviews, analyses of administrative data (2015-2020) and expert 
judgment. We estimated incremental costs, life-years and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for a representative cohort of patients with major depressive 
disorder in BC.
RESULTS: Pharmacogenomic testing, if implemented in BC for adult patients with 
moderate-severe major depressive disorder, was predicted to save the health 
system $956 million ($4926 per patient) and bring health gains of 0.064 
life-years and 0.381 QALYs per patient (12 436 life-years and 74 023 QALYs 
overall over 20 yr). These savings were mainly driven by slowing or avoiding the 
transition to refractory (treatment-resistant) depression. 
Pharmacogenomic-guided care was associated with 37% fewer patients with 
refractory depression over 20 years. Sensitivity analyses estimated that costs 
of pharmacogenomic testing would be offset within about 2 years of 
implementation.
INTERPRETATION: Pharmacogenomic testing to guide antidepressant use was 
estimated to yield population health gains while substantially reducing health 
system costs. These findings suggest that pharmacogenomic testing offers health 
systems an opportunity for a major value-promoting investment.

PURPOSE: Balance impairment and falls are common among patients after cancer 
treatment. This study aimed to compare static and dynamic balance functions in 
lung cancer survivors (LCS) and healthy controls and to investigate the factors 
related to balance in LCS.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from lung cancer patients whose 
treatment had been completed within the previous 3 months (n = 60) and age and 
gender-matched healthy controls (n = 60). Clinical characteristics and history 
of falls were recorded. Pulmonary function tests and measurements of respiratory 
muscle strength were performed. Dynamic and static balance, fear of falling, 
knee-extension strength, physical activity level, dyspnea, comorbidity, and 
quality of life (QoL) were assessed using the Time Up and Go Test, Single Leg 
Standing Test, the Fall Efficacy Scale-International, hand-held dynamometer, the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Modified Medical Research 
Dyspnea Scale, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Scale.
RESULTS: LCS reported a higher fall rate and exhibited lower dynamic balance 
compared to controls (p < 0.05). The number of chemotherapy cycles, number of 
falls in the past year, fear of falling, perceived dyspnea, forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s (%), maximal inspiratory pressure (%), knee-extension strength, 
physical activity score, and QoL score related to physical function were 
correlated with balance function in LCS (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: LCS had a higher risk of falls and lower dynamic balance function 
which might be related to various clinical and physical parameters.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Identifying factors related to balance should 
be considered within the scope of fall prevention approaches for these patients.

Life expectancy has increased immensely over the past decades, bringing new 
challenges to the health systems as advanced age increases the predisposition 
for many diseases. One of those is the burden of neurologic disorders. While 
many hypotheses have been placed to explain aging mechanisms, it has been widely 
accepted that the increasing pro-inflammatory status with advanced age or 
"inflammaging" is a main determinant of biological aging. Furthermore, 
inflammaging is at the cornerstone of many age-related diseases and its 
involvement in neurologic disorders is an exciting hypothesis. Indeed, aging and 
neurologic disorders development in the elderly seem to share some basic 
pathways that fundamentally converge on inflammation. Peripheral inflammation 
significantly influences brain function and contributes to the development of 
neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and 
multiple sclerosis. Understanding the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis 
of progressive neurological diseases is of crucial importance for developing 
effective treatments and interventions that can slow down or prevent disease 
progression, therefore, decreasing its social and economic burden.

BACKGROUND: While various consequences of belonging to sexual minorities have 
been examined - it remains completely unclear whether sexual minorities believe 
that they die earlier. Thus, our aim was to investigate the association between 
sexual orientation and expected longevity.
METHODS: Data from the German Ageing Survey, a nationally representative sample, 
were used (year 2014, n = 6,424 individuals; mean age: 63.6 years). It included 
individuals residing in private households aged 40 years and over in Germany. 
Sexual orientation (heterosexual; sexual minorities including homosexual, 
bisexual, or other) served as key independent variable. As outcome, we used the 
expected life expectancy. In multiple linear regressions it was adjusted for 
gender, age, education, marital status, labour force participation, BMI, smoking 
status, alcohol intake, sports activities, physical functioning, self-rated 
health and the number of chronic conditions.
RESULTS: Adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle-related and health-related 
factors, our study showed that sexual minorities reported a lower expected 
longevity (β=-0.69, p = .02) compared to heterosexuals. This association 
remained nearly the same in robustness checks.
