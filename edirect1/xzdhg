Increasing labour market participation among older workers is embedded in 
government policy in the United Kingdom and many other industrialised countries 
with rises in the state pension age in response to increasing life expectancy. 
Despite this, many workers stop working before state pension age with around a 
20% reduction in the proportion of adults in work between ages 50 and 60 in 2011 
in England and Wales. This paper considers the risk of remaining in work by 
region and gender between 2001 and 2011 for adults aged 40-49 in 2001. Men had 
significantly higher risk of extended working in the East Midlands (1.4×) East 
of England (1.5×), South East (1.6×), and South West (1.6×) compared with the 
North East. Women in all regions apart from London and Wales had significantly 
higher risk of extended working compared with the North East: ranging from 1.15 
times in the North West and West Midlands to 1.6 times in the South West. 
Adjustment for nonemployment-related socio-economic status, housing tenure, 
qualifications, and car ownership, and employment status in 2001 attenuated all 
significant regional differences in extended working in men and in women in most 
regions. Workplace characteristics attenuated most of the remaining regional 
differences in women: women working in larger employers in 2001 or working at 
distances of 200 km or more, abroad or from home, had lower risk of remaining in 
work, whereas access to a car and higher working hours increased risk. Policies 
to increase qualifications and skills among older adults are recommended.

Objectives: To estimate years of potential life lost (YPLL) and present value of 
future lost productivity (PVFLP) associated with premature mortality due to 
HPV-attributable cancers, specifically those targeted by nonavalent HPV (9vHPV) 
vaccination, in the United States (US) before vaccine use. Methods: YPLL was 
estimated from the reported number of deaths in 2017 due to HPV-related cancers, 
the proportion attributable to 9vHPV-targeted types, and age- and sex-specific 
US life expectancy. PVFLP was estimated as the product of YPLL by age- and 
sex-specific probability of labor force participation, annual wage, value of 
non-market labor, and fringe benefits markup factor. Results: An estimated 7,085 
HPV-attributable cancer deaths occurred in 2017 accounting for 154,954 YPLL, 
with 5,450 deaths (77%) and 121,226 YPLL (78%) attributable to 9vHPV-targeted 
types. The estimated PVFLP was $3.3 billion for cancer deaths attributable to 
9vHPV-targeted types (86% from women). The highest productivity burden was 
associated with cervical cancer in women and anal and oropharyngeal cancers in 
men. Conclusions: HPV-attributable cancer deaths are associated with a 
substantial economic burden in the US, much of which could be vaccine 
preventable.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes can lead to reduced productivity during working 
age. We aimed to estimate productive life years lost associated with type 2 
diabetes on the individual and population level in Germany in 2020 and 2040, 
while accounting for future trends in mortality.
METHODS: Based on a mathematical projection model, we estimated age- and 
sex-specific productivity losses associated with type 2 diabetes during working 
age (20-69 years) in Germany in 2020 and 2040. Productivity losses in terms of 
excess mortality (years of life lost, YLL) and reductions in labour force 
participation, presenteeism and absenteeism (years of productivity lost, YPL) 
were summed to calculate productivity-adjusted life years (PALY) lost. Input 
data for the projection were based on meta-analyses, representative 
population-based studies and population projections to account for future trends 
in mortality.
RESULTS: Compared with a person without type 2 diabetes, mean PALY lost per 
person with type 2 diabetes in 2020 was 2.6 years (95% CI 2.3, 3.0). Of these 
2.6 years, 0.4 (95% CI 0.3, 0.4) years were lost due to YLL and 2.3 (95% CI 1.9, 
2.6) years were lost due to YPL. Age- and sex-specific results show that younger 
age groups and women are expected to lose more productive life years than older 
age groups and men. Population-wide estimates suggest that 4.60 (95% CI 4.58, 
4.63) million people with prevalent type 2 diabetes in 2020 are expected to lose 
12.06 (95% CI 10.42, 13.76) million PALY (1.62 million years due to YLL and 
10.44 million years due to YPL). In 2040, individual-level PALY lost are 
projected to slightly decrease due to reductions in YLL. In contrast, 
population-wide PALY lost are projected to increase to 15.39 (95% CI 13.19, 
17.64) million due to an increase in the number of people with type 2 diabetes 
to 5.45 (95% CI 5.41, 5.50) million.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: On the population level, a substantial increase in 
productivity burden associated with type 2 diabetes was projected for Germany 
between 2020 and 2040. Efforts to reduce the incidence rate of type 2 diabetes 
and diabetes-related complications may attenuate this increase.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Standard hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell-culture models 
present an altered lipid metabolism and thus produce lipid-poor lipoviral 
particles (LVPs). These models are thereby weakly adapted to explore the 
complete natural viral life cycle.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: To overcome these limitations, we used an HCV cell-culture 
model based on both cellular differentiation and sustained hypoxia to better 
mimic the host-cell environment. The long-term exposure of Huh7.5 cells to DMSO 
and hypoxia (1% O2 ) significantly enhanced the expression of major 
differentiation markers and the cellular hypoxia adaptive response by contrast 
with undifferentiated and normoxic (21% O2 ) standard conditions. Because 
hepatocyte-like differentiation and hypoxia are key regulators of intracellular 
lipid metabolism, we characterized the distribution of lipid droplets (LDs) and 
demonstrated that experimental cells significantly accumulate larger and more 
numerous LDs relative to standard cell-culture conditions. An immunocapture (IC) 
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method showed that differentiated and 
hypoxic Huh7.5 cells produced lipoproteins significantly larger than those 
produced by standard Huh7.5 cell cultures. The experimental cell culture model 
is permissive to HCV-Japanese fulminant hepatitis (JFH1) infection and produces 
very-low-buoyant-density LVPs that are 6-fold more infectious than LVPs formed 
by standard JFH1-infected Huh7.5 cells. Finally, the IC-TEM approach and 
antibody-neutralization experiments revealed that LVPs were highly lipidated, 
had a global ultrastructure and a conformation of the envelope glycoprotein 
complex E1E2 close to that of the ones circulating in infected individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: This relevant HCV cell culture model thus mimics the complete 
native intracellular HCV life cycle and, by extension, can be proposed as a 
model of choice for studies of other hepatotropic viruses.

Transmembrane protein Golden goal (Gogo) interacts with atypical cadherin 
Flamingo (Fmi) to direct R8 photoreceptor axons in the Drosophila visual system. 
However, the precise mechanisms underlying Gogo regulation during columnar- and 
layer-specific R8 axon targeting are unknown. Our studies demonstrated that the 
insulin secreted from surface and cortex glia switches the phosphorylation 
status of Gogo, thereby regulating its two distinct functions. 
Non-phosphorylated Gogo mediates the initial recognition of the glial protrusion 
in the center of the medulla column, whereas phosphorylated Gogo suppresses 
radial filopodia extension by counteracting Flamingo to maintain a one 
axon-to-one column ratio. Later, Gogo expression ceases during the midpupal 
stage, thus allowing R8 filopodia to extend vertically into the M3 layer. These 
results demonstrate that the long- and short-range signaling between the glia 
and R8 axon growth cones regulates growth cone dynamics in a stepwise manner, 
and thus shapes the entire organization of the visual system.

INTRODUCTION: The Short-Form Six-Dimension version 2 (SF-6Dv2) is the newest 
preference-based instrument for estimation of quality adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity and reliability of 
the SF-6Dv2 in an Iranian breast cancer population.
METHODS: The SF-6Dv2 and FACT-B instruments were completed for 416 patients who 
were recruited from the largest academic center for cancer patients in Iran. The 
ceiling effects are computed as the proportion of participants reporting no 
problems in SF-6Dv2 index. Construct validity was evaluated using convergent 
validity, discriminant validity, and known-groups validity. Reliability was 
assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa 
value.
RESULTS: The ceiling effects of the SF-6Dv2 was 2.16%. Higher scores of all 
subscales of the FACT-B were associated with patients who reported no problems 
in each of the SF-6Dv2 dimensions. The correlation between SF-6Dv2 dimensions 
and FACT-B subscales varied from 0.109 between the role limitation of the 
SF-6Dv2 and the SWB subscale of the FACT-B to 0.665 between the pain dimension 
of SF-6Dv2 and the PWB of FACT-B. The lower mean score of SF-6Dv2 was associated 
with patients with older age, higher education level, more severe current 
treatment status, and more severe cancer stage status. ICC for the SF-6Dv2 index 
scores was 0.66, and Kappa values varied from 0.33 for mobility to 0.66 for 
mental health dimensions.
CONCLUSIONS: The validity and reliability of the SF-6Dv2 were satisfaction in a 
breast cancer population and it can be employed in clinical practice or 
research.

»: The United States has faced substantial increases in health-care expenditure, 
with specifically large increases in spine surgery costs.
»: Many different formulas are utilized to determine value in spine surgery, 
including cost- benefit analyses, cost-effectiveness analyses, and cost-utility 
analyses, with the overall determination of value being quality/cost.
»: Quality often is calculated indirectly using either process measures or 
outcome measures and represents the potential benefit of a given intervention, 
usually over a specific time period to yield quality-adjusted life years.
»: Costs are particularly difficult to calculate given the interhospital, 
regional, national, and global variability, as well as indirect costs of an 
intervention, and many different methods are utilized to estimate costs.
»: Spine surgeons should be familiar with the elements that compose 
cost-effectiveness and their potential shortcomings in order for providers and 
health-care policy makers to identify the highest-quality studies and 
interventions that provide the greatest benefit to patients.

University Hospital, Viale Pieraccini 24, 50139 Florence, Italy.

Within immune system-related diseases, autoimmunity has always represented a 
field of great interest, although many aspects remain poorly understood even 
today. Genetic syndromes associated with immunity disorders are common and 
represent an interesting model for a better understanding of the underlying 
mechanism of autoimmunity predisposition. Among these conditions, Down syndrome 
(DS) certainly deserves special attention as it represents the most common 
genetic syndrome associated with immune dysregulation, involving both innate and 
adaptive immunity. Autoimmunity represents a well-known complication of DS: it 
is estimated that people affected by this disease present a risk four to six 
times higher than the normal population to develop autoimmune diseases such as 
celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Several 
factors have been considered as possible etiology, including genetic and 
epigenetic modifications and immune dysregulation. In times in which the life 
expectancy of people with DS has been extremely prolonged, thanks to 
improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease and 
infectious complications, knowledge of the mechanisms and proper management of 
autoimmune diseases within this syndrome has become essential. In this short 
review, we aim to report the current literature regarding the genetic, immune, 
and environmental factors that have been proposed as the possible underlying 
mechanism of autoimmunity in individuals with DS, with the intent to provide 
insight for a comprehensive understanding of these diseases in genetic 
syndromes.

Clks have been shown by recent studies to be promising targets for cancer 
therapy, as they are considered key regulators in the process of pre-mRNA 
splicing, which in turn affects every aspect of tumor biology. In particular, 
Clk1 and -4 are overexpressed in several human tumors. Most of the potent Clk1 
inhibitors reported in the literature are non-selective, mainly showing 
off-target activity towards Clk2, Dyrk1A and Dyrk1B. Herein, we present new 
5-methoxybenzothiophene-2-carboxamide derivatives with unprecedented 
selectivity. In particular, the introduction of a 3,5-difluoro benzyl extension 
to the methylated amide led to the discovery of compound 10b (cell-free IC50 = 
12.7 nM), which was four times more selective for Clk1 over Clk2 than the 
previously published flagship compound 1b. Moreover, 10b showed an improved 
growth inhibitory activity with T24 cells (GI50 = 0.43 µM). Furthermore, a new 
binding model in the ATP pocket of Clk1 was developed based on the 
structure-activity relationships derived from new rigidified analogues.

Long-term care coverage is not integrated into an individual's retirement 
strategy. It is an additional public health service that is not considered into 
private pension funds. Nevertheless, this coverage is not sufficient due to the 
problems of financial sustainability of the public pension systems. However, 
there are large sums in pension plans dedicated to paying retirement pensions 
that can be transformed into support for long-term care coverage. This paper 
develops a mechanism of pension transformation through the different mortality 
of the beneficiary when becoming a dependent beneficiary. This mechanism allows 
the beneficiary to convert their pension to LTC support at their own choice, 
without increasing the cost of the private pension scheme. The proposed model 
provides consistency in the pension that a retiree receives and adapts it to a 
retiree's life expectancy: the retiree receives a higher pension when he/she 
needs it most.

The Sahara Desert is characterized by extreme environmental conditions, which 
are a unique challenge for life. Cyanobacteria are key players in the 
colonization of bare soils and form assemblages with other microorganisms in the 
top millimetres, establishing biological soil crusts (biocrusts) that cover most 
soil surfaces in deserts, which have important roles in the functioning of 
drylands. However, knowledge of biocrusts from these extreme environments is 
limited. Therefore, to study cyanobacterial community composition in biocrusts 
from the Sahara Desert, we utilized a combination of methodologies in which 
taxonomic assignation, for next-generation sequencing of soil samples, was based 
on phylogenetic analysis (16S rRNA gene) in parallel with morphological 
identification of cyanobacteria in natural samples and isolates from certain 
locations. Two close locations that differed in microenvironmental conditions 
were analysed. One was a dry salt lake (a "chott"), and the other was an 
extension of sandy, slightly saline soil. Differences in cyanobacterial 
composition between the sites were found, with a clear dominance of Microcoleus 
spp. in the less saline site, while the chott presented a high abundance of 
heterocystous cyanobacteria as well as the filamentous non-heterocystous 
Pseudophormidium sp. and the unicellular cf. Acaryochloris. The cyanobacteria 
found in our study area, such as Microcoleus steenstrupii, Microcoleus 
vaginatus, Scytonema hyalinum, Tolypothrix distorta, and Calothrix sp., are also 
widely distributed in other geographic locations around the world, where the 
conditions are less severe. Our results, therefore, indicated that some 
cyanobacteria can cope with polyextreme conditions, as confirmed by bioassays, 
and can be considered extremotolerant, being able to live in a wide range of 
conditions.

Despite the improvements in life expectancy, neurodegenerative conditions have 
arguably become the most dreaded maladies of older people. The neuroprotective 
and anti-ageing potentials of essential oils (EOs) are widely evaluated around 
the globe. The objective of this review is to analyse the effectiveness of EOs 
as neuroprotective remedies among the four common age-related neurodegenerative 
diseases. The literature was extracted from three databases (PubMed, Web of 
Science and Google Scholar) between the years of 2010 to 2020 using the medical 
subject heading (MeSH) terms "essential oil", crossed with "Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)", "Huntington's disease (HD)", "Parkinson's disease (PD)" or "amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS)". Eighty three percent (83%) of the studies were focused 
on AD, while another 12% focused on PD. No classifiable study was recorded on HD 
or ALS. EO from Salvia officinalis has been recorded as one of the most 
effective acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, 
only Cinnamomum sp. has been assessed for its effectiveness in both AD and PD. 
Our review provided useful evidence on EOs as potential neuroprotective remedies 
for age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Currently, AIDS or severe immunodeficiency remains as a challenge for people 
with HIV (PWHIV) and healthcare providers. Our purpose was to analyze the impact 
of advanced HIV disease (AHD) on mortality, life expectancy and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). We reviewed cohort studies and meta-analyses conducted 
in middle- and high-income countries. To analyze HRQoL, we selected studies that 
reported overall health and/or physical/mental health scores on a validated 
HRQoL instrument. AIDS diagnosis supposes a higher risk of mortality during the 
first six months, remaining higher for 48 months. It has been reported that 
cancer and cardiovascular disease persist as frequent causes of mortality in 
PWHIV, especially those with previous or current AHD. PWHIV who initiate 
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with CD4 < 200 cells/µL have 
significantly lower estimated life expectancy than those with higher counts. AHD 
is associated with lower HRQoL, and a worse physical health or mental health 
status. AIDS and non-AIDS defining events are significant predictors of a lower 
HRQoL, especially physical health status. AHD survivors are in risk of mortality 
and serious comorbidities, needing special clinical attention and preventive 
programs for associated comorbidities. Their specific needs should be reflected 
in HIV guidelines.

Depression is one of the most common disorders in psychiatric and primary care 
settings, and is associated with disability, loss in quality of life, and 
economic costs. Internet-based psychological interventions have been shown to be 
effective in depression treatment but present problems with a low degree of 
adherence. The main aim of this study is to analyze the adherence predictors in 
three low-intensity interventions programs applied by Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICTs) for depression. A multi-center, randomized, 
controlled clinical trial was conducted with 164 participants with depression, 
who were allocated to: Healthy Lifestyle Program, Positive Affect Promotion 
Program or Mindfulness Program. Sociodemographic characteristics, Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9, Visual Analog Scale, Short Form Health Survey, Positive and 
Negative Affect Schedule, Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, Pemberton 
Happiness Index and Treatment Expectancy Questionnaire were used to study 
adherence. Results showed that positive affect resulted in a predictor variable 
for Healthy Lifestyle Program and Positive Affect Promotion Program. Perceived 
health was also a negative adherence predictor for the Positive Affect Promotion 
Program. Our findings demonstrate that there are differences in clinical 
variables between treatment completers and non-completers and we provide 
adherence predictors in two intervention groups. Although new additional 
predictors have been examined, further research is essential in order to improve 
tailored interventions and increase adherence treatment.

The efficiency of some films prepared from heat-denatured whey protein isolate 
solutions on the quality and shelf-life of brook trout samples during storage at 
4 °C was studied in this research (WPIf-a film based on whey protein isolate and 
WPIf+2.5%TEO-a film based on whey protein isolate incorporated with 2.5% 
tarragon essential oil). The control and covered fish samples were periodically 
assessed (at 3 days) over 15 days of storage for the physicochemical (pH; EC, 
electrical conductivity; TVB-N, total volatile basic nitrogen; TBARS, 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; color), microbiological (TVC, total 
viable count; PTC, psychrotrophic count; LAB, lactic acid bacteria; 
H2S-producing bacteria), and sensory properties (color discoloration; odor; 
overall acceptability). The WPIf+2.5%TEO has proven enhanced quality 
preservation effects compared to WPIf by showing lower values for 
physicochemical parameters, lower microbial loads, and higher sensory scores in 
the fish sample. All these effects have led to an extension of the sample's 
shelf-life. In conclusion, the tarragon essential oil has conferred antioxidant 
and antimicrobial properties to the film. Thus, the WPIf+2.5%TEO could be a 
promising material for the packaging of fresh brook trout during refrigerated 
storage.

Objective: To quantitatively estimate life expectancy (LE) and depression and 
anxiety-free life expectancy (DAFLE) for the years 2013 and 2018 in Jiangxi 
Province, China, by sex and urban-rural areas. Additionally, to compare the 
discrepancy of DAFLE/LE of different sexes and urban-rural areas over various 
years. Methods: Based on the summary of the health statistics of Jiangxi 
Province in 2013 and 2018 and the results of the 5th and 6th National Health 
Service Surveys in Jiangxi Province, the model life table is used to estimate 
the age-specific mortality rate by sex and urban-rural areas. Sullivan's method 
was used to calculate DAFLE. Results: Data from 2013 indicate that those aged 15 
can expect to live 56.20 years without depression and anxiety for men and 59.67 
years without depression and anxiety for women. Compared to 2013, DAFLE had not 
fluctuated significantly in 2018. The proportion of life expectancy without 
depression and anxiety (DAFLE/LE) declined between 2013 and 2018. DAFLE/LE in 
urban areas was higher than in rural areas. Men had higher DAFLE/LE than women. 
From 2013 to 2018, the DAFLE aged 15 decreased by 0.18 years for urban men and 
decreased by 0.52 years for urban women, rural areas also decreased to varying 
degrees. Conclusions: Even if women had a longer life span than men, they would 
spend more time with depression or anxiety. DAFLE did not increase with the 
increase in LE from 2013 to 2018, suggesting an absolute expansion of the 
burden, especially in rural areas. Depression and anxiety health services in 
Jiangxi, China will face more serious obstacles and challenges, which may lead 
to more disability. This requires more attention and more effective measures 
from the public, medical departments and the government.

The World Health Organization estimates that only approximately 25% of diversity 
in longevity is explained by genetic factors, while the other 75% is largely 
determined by interactions with the physical and social environments. Indeed, 
aging is a multifactorial process that is influenced by a range of 
environmental, sociodemographic, and biopsychosocial factors, all of which might 
act in concert to determine the process of aging. The global average life 
expectancy increased fundamentally over the past century, toward an aging 
population, correlating with the development and onset of age-related diseases, 
mainly from cardiovascular and neurological nature. Therefore, the 
identification of determinants of healthy and unhealthy aging is a major goal to 
lower the burden and socioeconomic costs of age-related diseases. The role of 
environmental factors (such as air pollution and noise exposure) as crucial 
determinants of the aging process are being increasingly recognized. Here, we 
critically review recent findings concerning the pathomechanisms underlying the 
aging process and their correlates in cardiovascular and neurological disease, 
centered on oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as the influence of 
prominent environmental pollutants, namely air pollution and traffic noise 
exposure, which is suggested to accelerate the aging process. Insight into these 
types of relationships and appropriate preventive strategies are urgently needed 
to promote healthy aging.

The prime objective of the research was to explore the coating effects of 
chitosan and nano-silicon dioxide with nisin as an antimicrobial agent on 
physicochemical properties, microbiological stability, and sensorial quality 
changes during the storage at 4 °C. The combination of nano-material and 
chitosan in addition to nisin was effective for reducing the postharvest 
attributes of fresh-cut cantaloupes in addition to the highest score in sensory 
evaluation. Chitosan coating treatment enhanced the microbiological quality 2.50 
log CFU/g and 1.87 log CFU/g for aerobic counts and mold/yeasts populations, 
respectively. In a word, the combination of chitosan/nano-silica/nisin treatment 
was the best condition for fresh-cut cantaloupe shelf life extension by 
maintaining color, vitamin C 22.29 mg/100g, peroxidase activity 8.06 U/min.g, 
and other microbiological tests up to storage time of 8 days.

Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of a third copy of 
chromosome 21, associated with intellectual disabilities. Down syndrome is 
associated with anomalies of both the nervous and endocrine systems. Over the 
past decades, dramatic advances in Down syndrome research and treatment have 
helped to extend the life expectancy of these patients. Improved life expectancy 
is obviously a positive outcome, but it is accompanied with the need to address 
previously overlooked complications and comorbidities of Down syndrome, 
including obesity and diabetes, in order to improve the quality of life of Down 
syndrome patients. In this focused review, we describe the associations between 
Down syndrome and comorbidities, obesity and diabetes, and we discuss the 
understanding of proposed mechanisms for the association of Down syndrome with 
metabolic disorders. Drawing molecular mechanisms through which Type 1 diabetes 
and Type 2 diabetes could be linked to Down syndrome could allow identification 
of novel drug targets and provide therapeutic solutions to limit the development 
of metabolic and cognitive disorders.

To reliably detect the latent defects and accurately evaluate the remaining life 
of gas insulated switchgear (GIS) basin insulators, more effective detection and 
characterization methods need to be explored. The study of pyrolysis kinetic 
parameters based on the intrinsic characteristics of materials provides a new 
way to solve this problem. First, an integral expression model of the reaction 
mechanism function with four parameters is proposed in this paper, which can 
represent various existing reaction mechanism functions with better universality 
and more application fields. Then, on the basis of the temperature 
transformation equation, an improved method for calculating the activation 
energy is presented, which shows higher computational accuracy than the existing 
methods. Further, based on a non-isothermal kinetic equation, the structure of 
the experimental function is given. It is a method for solving the pyrolysis 
reaction mechanism function of insulating materials, which can also be used to 
calculate the pre-exponential factor simultaneously. The thermogravimetric 
analysis experiment is carried out on a certain basin insulator sample at 
different heating rates. The pyrolysis kinetic state parameters, including the 
activation energy, reaction mechanism function and pre-exponential factor of the 
basin insulator, are calculated. Finally, the life prediction method of basin 
insulators is established, and the key factors affecting the life of insulators 
are discussed.

The aim of the study was to assess, through a comparative shelf-life test, the 
suitability of two packaging materials, namely macro-perforated polypropylene 
(PP MA) and micro-perforated coextruded polypropylene (PP C), for the quality 
preservation of green asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L. 'Vegalim'). Quality of 
spears was evaluated during 30 days at refrigerated storage by monitoring 
chemical, physical, and enzymatic parameters as well as sensory descriptors. PP 
C kept headspace composition close to suggested values for fresh green 
asparagus. Total color difference increased during the storage and it was highly 
correlated with chlorophyll-a and carotenoids, however, sensory color perception 
did not change significantly until 22 days of storage. PP C maintained ascorbic 
acid concentrations close to the initial levels, limited total phenolic compound 
loss to 24% (45% in PP MA), determined an increase of 72% in fiber content and 
small changes in lignin value; enzymatic changes were significantly inhibited. 
Significant sensorial differences were detected after 22 days of storage, with 
PP C performing better than PP MA. PP C film was confirmed as the best choice, 
limiting weight loss and maintaining a fresh-like appearance during 30 days of 
storage, thus allowing an extension in postharvest life.

(1) Background: Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is a non-motor feature in 
Parkinson's disease with negative impact on functionality and life expectancy, 
prompting early detection and proper management. We aimed to describe the blood 
pressure patterns reported in patients with Parkinson's disease, as measured by 
24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. (2) Methods: We conducted a 
systematic search on the PubMed database. Studies enrolling patients with 
Parkinson's disease undergoing 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were 
included. Data regarding study population, Parkinson's disease course, 
vasoactive drugs, blood pressure profiles, and measurements were recorded. (3) 
Results: The search identified 172 studies. Forty studies eventually fulfilled 
the inclusion criteria, with 3090 patients enrolled. Abnormal blood pressure 
profiles were commonly encountered: high blood pressure in 38.13% of patients 
(938/2460), orthostatic hypotension in 38.68% (941/2433), supine hypertension in 
27.76% (445/1603) and nocturnal hypertension in 38.91% (737/1894). Dipping 
status was also altered often, 40.46% of patients (477/1179) being reverse 
dippers and 35.67% (310/869) reduced dippers. All these patterns were correlated 
with negative clinical and imaging outcomes. (4) Conclusion: Patients with 
Parkinson's disease have significantly altered blood pressure patterns that 
carry a negative prognosis. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be 
validated as a biomarker of PD-associated cardiovascular dysautonomia and a tool 
for assisting therapeutic interventions.
