lungs.
METHODS: In explanted lungs of 20 CF patients emphysema was semi-quantitatively 
assessed on histology specimens. Also, emphysema was automatically quantified on 
pre-transplantation computed tomography (CT) using the percentage of voxels 
below -950 Houndfield Units and was visually scored on CT. The relation between 
emphysema extent, pre-transplantation lung function and age was determined.
RESULTS: All CF patients showed emphysema on histological examination: 3/20 
(15%) showed mild, 15/20 (75%) moderate and 2/20 (10%) severe emphysema, defined 
as 0-20% emphysema, 20-50% emphysema and >50% emphysema in residual lung tissue, 
respectively. Visually upper lobe bullous emphysema was identified in 13/20 and 
more diffuse non-bullous emphysema in 18/20. Histology showed a significant 
correlation to quantified CT emphysema (p = 0.03) and visual emphysema score (p 
= 0.001). CT and visual emphysema extent were positively correlated with age (p 
= 0.045 and p = 0.04, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study both pathologically and radiologically 
confirms that emphysema is common in end-stage CF lungs, and is age related. 
Emphysema might become an increasingly important disease component in the aging 
CF population.

Effective chemical control relies on reducing vector population size. However, 
insecticide selection pressure is often associated with the development of 
resistant populations that reduce control success. In treated areas, these 
resistant individuals present an adaptive advantage due to enhanced survival. 
Resistance can also lead to negative effects when the insecticide pressure 
ceases. In this study, the biological effects of deltamethrin resistance were 
assessed in the Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans. The length of each 
developmental stage and complete life cycle, mating rate, and fecundity were 
evaluated. Susceptible and resistant insects presented similar mating rates. A 
reproductive cost of resistance was expressed as a lower fecundity in the 
resistant colony. Developmental costs in the resistant colony were in the form 
of a shortening of the second and third nymph stage duration and an extension of 
the fifth stage. A maternal effect of deltamethrin resistance is suggested as 
these effects were identified in resistant females and their progeny 
independently of the mated male's deltamethrin response. Our results suggest the 
presence of pleiotropic effects of deltamethrin resistance. Possible 
associations of these characters to other traits such as developmental delays 
and behavioral resistance are discussed.

OBJECT: Pituitary adenomas are well suited to resection by a minimal-access 
endoscopic technique. Validation of this approach requires prospective outcome 
studies to determine the impact on quality of life (QOL). This study aims to 
assess the effect of endoscopic pituitary adenoma resection on site-specific and 
sinonasal-related QOL before and after endoscopic surgery using validated 
instruments.
METHODS: Consecutive adult patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal resection of 
pituitary adenoma were prospectively enrolled from a single tertiary care 
center. All patients completed the Anterior Skull Base Questionnaire (ASBQ) and 
the 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) preoperatively and then at regular 
intervals after surgery to assess their perceived QOL with regard to hormonal, 
surgical, and anatomical factors.
RESULTS: Eighty-one of 114 patients were eligible for study; median follow-up 
was 16 months. This cohort included 24 (29.6%) nonsecreting macroadenomas and 57 
(70.4%) hypersecreting tumors. There was significant improvement in the mean 
ASBQ score at 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery (p < 0.05), while 
postoperative SNOT-22 scores, at the same time points, showed no significant 
difference from preoperative scores. Both ASBQ and SNOT-22 scores showed 
transient worsening at 3 weeks postoperatively. Subtotal resection correlated 
with worse QOL, both overall and among patients with hypersecreting tumors (p < 
0.05). Extrasellar tumor extension, intraoperative CSF leakage, and a 
reconstruction technique during surgery did not impact postoperative QOL. Visual 
disturbances did not significantly alter QOL. There were no postoperative CSF 
leaks in this series.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic resection of pituitary adenoma is associated with 
long-term improvements in site-specific QOL and stability in sinonasal QOL when 
assessed pre- and postoperatively with validated instruments. Subtotal resection 
was the only factor that negatively impacted postoperative QOL. Therefore, 
gross-total resection should be attempted for all patients to optimize QOL after 
surgery.

Value of children and fertility: Results from a cross-cultural comparative 
survey in eighteen areas in Asia, Africa, Europe and America.

For explaining cross-cultural differences in fertility behavior, this paper 
conjoins three complementary approaches: the 'demand'-based economic theory of 
fertility (ETF), a revised version of the 'supply'-based 'value-of-children' 
(VOC)-approach as a special theory of the general social theory of social 
production functions and the framing theory of variable rationality. A 
comprehensive model is specified that encompasses the variable efficiency of 
having children for the optimization of physical well-being and of social esteem 
of (potential) parents; it also accounts for the variable rationality of 
fertility decisions. The model is tested with a data set that comprises 
information on VOC and fertility of women within the social settings of 18 areas 
(Peoples Republic of China, North and South India, Indonesia, Palestine, Israel, 
Turkey, Ghana, South Africa, East and West Germany, the Czech Republic, France, 
Russia, Poland, Estonia, the United States and Jamaica). Latent class analysis 
is used to establish a measurement model for the costs and benefits of children 
and to analyze area differences by a two-level multinomial-model. Two-level 
Cox-regressions are used to estimate the effects of perceived costs and benefits 
of children, individual resources and context opportunities, with births of 
different parity as dependents. This simultaneous test in a cross-cultural 
context goes beyond the current state of fertility research and provides 
evidence about the cross-cultural validity of the model, the systematic effects 
of VOC on fertility and the changing rationality of fertility decisions during 
demographic transition and socio-economic change.

Geographical variations in fertility have been observed within several countries 
in Northern Europe, with higher fertility in rural areas, smaller settlements 
and city suburbs. However, the processes underlying such fertility variations 
across residential contexts are not well understood. This paper contributes to 
the on-going debate by looking at local variations in fertility in Britain. It 
aims to disentangle the relative contribution of a number of factors, including 
the socio-economic characteristics of individuals, housing conditions, patterns 
of residential relocation and lastly, contextual factors stricto sensu. In 
addition, it seeks to identify those aspects of reproductive behaviour which are 
more likely to be associated with the observed spatial differences, and to 
distinguish between those that may be influenced by local context and those that 
respond to social influences at different scales. The focus is on local 
fertility contexts which, we argue, have the potential to influence the 
fertility behaviour of individuals through processes of social learning. 
Individual level data from the British Household Panel Survey and methods of 
event history analysis are used to explore women's transitions to second and 
third order births in Britain in the early 21st century. Our findings indicate 
that individual reproductive life paths respond to a variety of social processes 
acting at various scales, and that these influences vary by birth order. Most 
interestingly, local fertility contexts influence transition to first birth but 
not transition to higher order births, which are mainly associated with 
individual characteristics of women and their partners. Dominant spacing 
effects, however, suggest that local contexts have an indirect impact on second 
and third births through age at the onset of childbearing. The study 
demonstrates the importance of considering social interaction theories, and 
their extension to scale-sensitive spatial contexts in which these interactions 
take place, when analysing geographical variations in fertility. Future research 
seeking to explain subnational fertility variations must recognize the 
importance of developing theoretical understandings to inform empirical work.

Among alternatives that are currently under investigation to replace the use of 
synthetic fungicides to control postharvest diseases in fresh produce and to 
extend their shelf life, chitosan application has shown promising disease 
control, at both preharvest and postharvest stages. Chitosan shows a dual mode 
of action, on the pathogen and on the plant, as it reduces the growth of 
decay-causing fungi and foodborne pathogens and induces resistance responses in 
the host tissues. Chitosan coating forms a semipermeable film on the surface of 
fruit and vegetables, thereby delaying the rate of respiration, decreasing 
weight loss, maintaining the overall quality, and prolonging the shelf life. 
Moreover, the coating can provide a substrate for incorporation of other 
functional food additives, such as minerals, vitamins, or other drugs or 
nutraceutical compounds that can be used to enhance the beneficial properties of 
fresh commodities, or in some cases the antimicrobial activity of chitosan. 
Chitosan coating has been approved as GRAS substance by USFDA, and its 
application is safe for the consumer and the environment. This review summarizes 
the most relevant and recent knowledge in the application of chitosan in 
postharvest disease control and maintenance of overall fruit and vegetable 
quality during postharvest storage.

Informal caring is of significant and increasing importance in the context of an 
ageing population, growing pressures on public finances, and increasing life 
expectancy at older ages. A growing body of research has examined the 
characteristics associated with informal care provision, as well as the impact 
of caring for the carer's physical and mental health, and their economic 
activity. However, only a relatively small body of literature has focused on the 
study of 'repeat' or continuous caring over time, and the factors associated 
with such trajectories. In 2001, for the first time, the United Kingdom census 
asked about provision of informal care, enabling identification of the 
prevalence of informal caregiving at a national level. This paper follows up 
informal carers from the 2001 Census in order to examine their characteristics 
and circumstances 10 years later using a nationally representative 1% sample of 
linked census data for England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics 
Longitudinal Study. The analysis classifies the range of possible combinations 
of caring and non-caring roles between 2001 and 2011, focusing on the 
characteristics of those who were providing care at one, or both, time points. 
Among other results, the analysis identified that, among those who were carers 
in 2001, caring again in, or continuing to care until, 2011 was associated with 
being female, aged between 45 and 54 years in 2011, looking after the home, and 
providing care for 50 hours or more per week in 2001. Such results contribute to 
our understanding of a particular group of informal carers and provide a more 
nuanced picture of informal care provision at different stages of the life 
course.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
EVE+EXE versus endocrine monotherapies in the treatment of postmenopausal women 
with HR(+), HER2(-) ABC after failure of treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase 
inhibitors from a US third-party payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the costs and 
effectiveness associated with EVE+EXE, exemestane (EXE), fulvestrant (FUL), and 
tamoxifen (TAM) over a 10-year time horizon. The model included 3 health states: 
responsive/stable disease, progression, or death. Monthly transition 
probabilities were estimated based on the BOLERO-2 (Breast cancer trials of OraL 
EveROlimus-2) data and network meta-analyses. Costs included drug acquisition 
and administration costs, medical costs associated health states, and costs for 
managing adverse events (AEs). Utilities for each health state and disutilities 
for AEs were derived from the literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) were estimated by comparing EVE+EXE with each endocrine 
monotherapy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case, EVE+EXE was associated with 1.99 QALYs and total 
direct costs of $258,648 over 10 years. The incremental cost per QALY of EVE+EXE 
was $139,740 compared with EXE, $157,749 compared with FUL, and $115,624 
compared with TAM. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $130,000/QALY or above, 
EVE+EXE appeared to be the most cost-effective treatment among all drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus with EXE demonstrated QALY improvements compared with 3 
other endocrine monotherapies. Benchmarked by the economic value of other novel 
cancer therapies, EVE+EXE might be considered a cost-effective option compared 
with endocrine therapies for HR(+)/HER2(-) ABC.

Value of Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgery.

Kocher MS(1).

Author information:

Value has become the buzzword of contemporaneous health care reform. Value is 
defined as outcomes relative to costs. Orthopaedic surgery has come under 
increasing scrutiny due to high procedural costs. However, orthopaedic surgery 
may actually be a great value given the benefits of treatment. The American 
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Value Project team was tasked to develop 
a model for assessing the benefits of orthopaedic surgery including indirect 
costs related to productivity and health-related quality of life. This model was 
applied to 5 orthopaedic conditions demonstrating robust societal and economic 
value. In all cost-effectiveness models, younger patients demonstrated greater 
cost-effectiveness given increased lifespan and productivity. This has 
tremendous implications within the field of pediatric orthopedic surgery. 
Pediatric orthopaedics may be the best value in medicine!

Small berries are commonly packaged and sold to consumers in vented 
petroleum-based clamshell containers. Biodegradable and compostable packages may 
be used as an alternative package to reduce waste generation and landfill 
disposal. In addition, the current clamshell container design does not allow the 
development of a modified atmosphere that could prolong berry shelf life. Thus, 
in this study, a non-ventilated biodegradable container was evaluated as a 
possible alternative to the containers normally used in commercial distribution 
of small berries. To determine the potential of biodegradable containers for 
small berries, highbush blueberries were packaged in polylactide (PLA) 
containers and stored at 10°C for 18 days and at 23°C for 9 days. Commercial 
vented clamshell containers were used as controls. Physicochemical and 
microbiological studies were carried out in order to compare the efficacy of 
both packages. Results showed that the PLA containers prolonged blueberry shelf 
life at different storage temperatures.

BACKGROUND: Exercise started shortly after breast cancer diagnosis might prevent 
or diminish fatigue complaints. The Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment 
(PACT) study was designed to primarily examine the effects of an 18-week 
exercise intervention, offered in the daily clinical practice setting and 
starting within 6 weeks after diagnosis, on preventing an increase in fatigue.
METHODS: This multi-centre controlled trial randomly assigned 204 breast cancer 
patients to usual care (n = 102) or supervised aerobic and resistance exercise 
(n = 102). By design, all patients received chemotherapy between baseline and 18 
weeks. Fatigue (i.e., primary outcome at 18 weeks), quality of life, anxiety, 
depression, and physical fitness were measured at 18 and 36 weeks.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat mixed linear model analyses showed that physical 
fatigue increased significantly less during cancer treatment in the intervention 
group compared to control (mean between-group differences at 18 weeks: -1.3; 95 
% CI -2.5 to -0.1; effect size -0.30). Results for general fatigue were 
comparable but did not reach statistical significance (-1.0, 95%CI -2.1; 0.1; 
effect size -0.23). At 18 weeks, submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness and 
several muscle strength tests (leg extension and flexion) were significantly 
higher in the intervention group compared to control, whereas peak oxygen uptake 
did not differ between groups. At 36 weeks these differences were no longer 
statistically significant. Quality of life outcomes favoured the exercise group 
but were not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A supervised 18-week exercise programme offered early in routine 
care during adjuvant breast cancer treatment showed positive effects on physical 
fatigue, submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle strength. Exercise 
early during treatment of breast cancer can be recommended. At 36 weeks, these 
effects were no longer statistically significant. This might have been caused by 
the control participants' high physical activity levels during follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: Pathologic or osteoporotic femoral neck fractures usually treated 
with joint replacement surgery rather than joint-preserving surgery because 
multiple screw fixation has a high risk for fixation failure and nonunion as 
well as the need for a postoperative protection period. However, 
joint-preserving surgery might be preferable in high-risk patients with short 
life expectancy due to advanced disease. Recently introduced hollow-perforated 
screws are devices for achieving percutaneous fixation by simultaneous injection 
to the weak bone area through its multiple side holes. We report our experience 
of surgical treatment of femoral neck fractures by controlled bone cement 
injection into the femoral head and neck through a modified hollow-perforated 
screw in patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: We modified the hollow perforated screw with variable placing of 
screw-side holes as fracture patterns. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement 
was injected through the screw holes to control its injection into the selective 
areas of the femoral head and neck while avoiding the fracture sites. One or two 
of these were fixed percutaneously in 12 patients who have Garden stage I or II 
femoral neck fractures in the advanced state of advanced cancer. Seven patients 
had pathologic fracture by metastatic cancer, but 5 had osteoporotic fractures.
RESULTS: Eleven patients died a mean of 4.1 months after surgery and 1 patient 
lived with ability to walk for 48 months. Sixteen modified hollow 
perforated-screws and 16 standard cannulated screws were used for fixation. The 
mean volume of cement injection was 13.8 ml. The complication developed in 4 
patients: cement leakage to the hip joint in 2 patients, subtrochanteric 
fracture in 1 patient (5 months after surgery) and fixation failure in 1 
patients (2 months after surgery). Nine patients could walk with or without a 
walking aid, and all others also could return to the prefracture-ambulation 
state with effective pain relief on the third postoperative day.
CONCLUSION: This current surgical method could be useful in patients with short 
life expectancy because of quick pain relief, early return to ambulation, simple 
operative procedures and short hospital stay. The modified hollow perforated 
screw which has a diversity of side hole locations for the regulation of bone 
cement injection into the planned area seems useful for selective femoral neck 
fractures.

BACKGROUND: Disease burden should be an important component for guiding research 
funding.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the relationship between dermatologic research 
funded from 2012 to 2013 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and US skin 
disease burden as measured by disability-adjusted life years in the Global 
Burden of Disease 2010 study.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was independently performed by 2 researchers 
who matched projects from the 2012 to 2013 NIH Research Portfolio Online 
Reporting Tools with 15 skin conditions and their respective disability-adjusted 
life years from Global Burden of Disease 2010.
RESULTS: The NIH funded 1108 projects spanning the 15 skin conditions. Melanoma 
received almost half of the total skin condition budget (49.5%). Melanoma, 
nonmelanoma skin cancer, and leprosy were funded above what would be suggested 
by their disease burden, whereas dermatitis, acne vulgaris, pruritus, urticaria, 
decubitus ulcer, fungal skin diseases, alopecia areata, cellulitis, and scabies 
appeared underfunded. Bacterial skin diseases, viral skin diseases, and 
psoriasis were well matched with disease burden.
LIMITATIONS: Disease burden is one of many factors that may be used to guide 
priority-setting decisions.
CONCLUSION: Skin disease burden measured by disability-adjusted life year 
metrics partially correlates with NIH funding prioritization. Comparing US 
disease burden with NIH funding suggests possible underfunded and overfunded 
skin diseases.

Malignancies of the genitourinary tract are diagnosed with increased frequency 
compared to the past. Currently prostate and bladder cancer account for the 
majority of urological malignancies. While for prostate cancer recent 
developments in the management of local and metastatic disease are likely to 
lead the majority of patients to either cure from the disease or to longer 
survival time, for bladder cancer advanced disease will unfortunately lead to 
death within months. However, the common clinical scenario in both prostate and 
bladder cancer includes, in high incidence, upper urinary tract obstruction in 
the advanced stages of these malignancies. This coupled with the fact that 
average life expectancy in the western world is increasing, will result in a 
significant patient population with either advanced, non-curable disease or with 
problems related to the received therapeutic surgical or medical interventions. 
There is no doubt that in both circumstances the room and role of palliation 
therapy is increasing. The care of patients with advanced urologic malignancies 
requires a multi-disciplinary effort from physicians of many specialties under 
the guiding role of the treating urologist. This review focuses on currently 
available palliative therapeutic options for upper urinary tract obstruction in 
the setting of patients with advanced malignancies of the urinary tract, as 
recently significant advancements have been witnessed in this field.

medicine, University of Pittsburgh, PA/USA.

AIM: This study investigated the utility of the alveolar-arterial (AaDO2) 
gradient in predicting the short-term prognosis of submassive pulmonary embolism 
(PE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled 124 patients with 
acute submassive PE. During the first 24 h of admission, all patients had 
initial artery blood gas collected under room air. Cardiac troponin T (cTn-T) 
was measured and on spiral computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and 
echocardiography both right ventricle diameter and left ventricle diameter was 
calculated (RV/LV ratio). Patients who did not have objectively confirmed 
submassive PE and who had curative anticoagulant treatment for more than 24 
hours and had a life expectancy less than 3 months were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: The best cut-off value for AaDO2 was 42.38 mmHg and using this, 
fourteen of 15 patients who died had AaO2 ≥ 42.38 and 71 of 109 patients who 
survived had a AaO2 lower than 42.38 with a sensitivity, specificity and 
negative predictive value (NPV) for overall deaths were 93.3%, 65.1% and 98.6% 
respectively. In addition, AaDO2 < 42.38 showed significant survival benefit for 
overall mortality rates. In this study, having high cTn-T and PaO2/ PaCO2 < 1.83 
and pulmonary artery pressure > 47.5 were also an indicator of poor prognosis 
for patients with submasssive PE.
CONCLUSION: The AaDO2 measurement is a highly useful and simple measurement for 
predicting short-term prognosis in patients with submassive PE. It may be used 
in risk stratification of patients with submassive PE. Aggressive thrombolytic 
treatment strategies may be considered for patients who have AaO2 < 42.38.

OBJECTIVE: Dementia is known to increase mortality, but the relative loss of 
life years and contributing factors are not well established. Thus, we aimed to 
investigate mortality in incident dementia from disease onset.
METHOD: Data were derived from the prospective longitudinal German AgeCoDe 
study. We used proportional hazards models to assess the impact of 
sociodemographic and health characteristics on mortality after dementia onset, 
Kaplan-Meier method for median survival times.
RESULTS: Of 3214 subjects at risk, 523 (16.3%) developed incident dementia 
during a 9-year follow-up period. Median survival time after onset was 3.2 years 
(95% CI = 2.8-3.7) at a mean age of 85.0 (SD = 4.0) years (≥2.6 life years lost 
compared with the general German population). Survival was shorter in older age, 
males other dementias than Alzheimer's, and in the absence of subjective memory 
complaints (SMC).
CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize that dementia substantially shortens life 
expectancy. Future studies should further investigate the potential impact of 
SMC on mortality in dementia.

OBJECTIVE: Along with the advances of newly developed medical therapies in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the number of pharmacoeconomical issues has been paid 
attention rapidly. For cost-utility analysis and determination of 
quality-adjusted life years, measurement of the EuroQol 5-dimensional 
descriptive system (EQ-5D) is essential, and has been used in several clinical 
studies. However, EQ-5D utility measure in Japanese patients with RA, especially 
in daily practice has not been fully documented. We analyzed the distribution of 
EQ5D utility scores and investigated the relationship between other clinical 
measures based on our Institute of Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis (IORRA) 
database.
METHOD: Among 5,284 outpatients who participated in the IORRA cohort study on 
October 2007, data from 5,043 patients who completed the EQ-5D questionnaire 
were cross-sectionally analyzed. EQ-5D scores in each subgroup for baseline 
feature such as gender, age, disease activity score 28 (DAS28), and Japanese 
version of health assessment questionnaire (J-HAQ) were evaluated. For the 
evaluation of variables that influenced EQ-5D score, the contribution of each 
variable was evaluated by ANOVA.
RESULTS: Average EQ-5D score was 0.76 in 5,284 patients (84% females, average 
age: 59.0 years, average disease duration: 12.4 years) whose average DAS28 was 
3.3 and average J-HAQ was 0.74. EQ-5D scores were highly correlated with J-HAQ 
and DAS28, and were significantly lower in females and rheumatoid 
factor-positive patients. Older age, longer disease duration, higher DAS28, and 
higher J-HAQ were also significantly associated with lower EQ-5D scores. In 
multivariate analysis, the factor that most strongly influenced EQ-5D was J-HAQ 
(57.6%), followed by pain visual analog score (VAS; 12.5%).
CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrated the distribution of EQ-5D score in 
the daily practice of RA patients, and provides important information for the 
pharmacoeconomical studies in rheumatology.

When some trials provide individual patient data (IPD) and the others provide 
only aggregate data (AD), meta-analysis methods for combining IPD and AD are 
required. We propose a method that reconstructs the missing IPD for AD trials by 
a Bayesian sampling procedure and then applies an IPD meta-analysis model to the 
mixture of simulated IPD and collected IPD. The method is applicable when a 
treatment effect can be assumed fixed across trials. We focus on situations of a 
single continuous outcome and covariate and aim to estimate treatment-covariate 
interactions separated into within-trial and across-trial effect. An 
illustration with hypertension data which has similar mean covariates across 
trials indicates that the method substantially reduces mean square error of the 
pooled within-trial interaction estimate in comparison with existing approaches. 
A simulation study supposing there exists one IPD trial and nine AD trials 
suggests that the method has suitable type I error rate and approximately zero 
bias as long as the available IPD contains at least 10% of total patients, where 
the average gain in mean square error is up to about 40%. However, the method is 
currently restricted by the fixed effect assumption, and extension to random 
effects to allow heterogeneity is required.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot economic evaluation was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of the endoscopic polypectomy in the clinic (EPIC) procedure 
compared to formal endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for the treatment of select 
chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients with nasal polyposis.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov decision tree model with a 
30-year time horizon. The two comparative treatment groups were as follows: (i) 
EPIC and (ii) ESS. Costs and effects were discounted at a rate of 3.5%. A 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed.
SETTING: Economic perspective of the Canadian government third-party payer.
PARTICIPANTS: CRS patients with nasal polyposis who have predominantly isolated 
symptoms of nasal obstruction with or without olfactory loss.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Over a time period of 30 years, the reference case demonstrated that 
the ESS strategy cost a total of $21,345 and produced 13.17 QALYs while the EPIC 
strategy cost a total of $5591 and produced 12.93 QALYs. The ESS versus EPIC 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $65,641/QALY. The probability that EPIC 
is cost-effective compared to ESS at a maximum willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$30,000 and $50,000/QALY is 66% and 60%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes from this study have demonstrated that the EPIC procedure 
may be a cost-effective treatment strategy for 'select' patients with nasal 
polyposis. Data from this study were obtained from a small pilot trial, and we 
feel the results warrant a future randomised controlled trial to strengthen the 
outcomes.

Active surveillance in prostate cancer: a critical review.

The aim of this paper was to examine the eligibility criteria, surveillance 
protocols and oncological outcomes of published active surveillance (AS) series. 
We also assessed the evidence for utility of novel tools for optimal risk 
stratification and surveillance of men suitable for AS. A non-systematic 
literature search of the Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases was performed in 
April 2015 using medical subject headings and free-text protocol. The search was 
conducted by applying free-text protocol with the following search terms: 
"active surveillance", "prostate cancer", "prostatic neoplasm", "watchful 
waiting", "low risk prostate cancer" and "very low risk prostate cancer". The 
definition of insignificant disease remains debatable as criteria for patient 
selection vary among studies. Tools for better selection of candidates and 
monitoring of the disease process have evolved since the conception of AS, 
including new biomarkers like phi, mpMRI and alternate biopsy strategies. AS is 
a sound strategy for reducing overtreatment of men with low-risk, and 
potentially selected men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer and shorter life 
expectancy, without compromising overall and cancer specific survival. More data 
are needed on the optimal integration of the new tools on AS paradigms and on 
the long-term health impact of AS in different populations.
