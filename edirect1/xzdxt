BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a major public health issue. Because lifetime risk, life 
expectancy, and years of life lost are meaningful metrics for clinical decision 
making, we aimed to estimate these measures for type 2 diabetes in the 
high-income setting.
METHODS: For this multinational, population-based study, we sourced data from 24 
databases for 23 jurisdictions (either whole countries or regions of a country): 
Australia; Austria; Canada; Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Hong Kong; 
Hungary; Israel; Italy; Japan; Latvia; Lithuania; the Netherlands; Norway; 
Scotland; Singapore; South Korea; Spain; Taiwan; the UK; and the USA. Our main 
outcomes were lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes, life expectancy in people with 
and without type 2 diabetes, and years of life lost to type 2 diabetes. We 
modelled the incidence and mortality of type 2 diabetes in people with and 
without type 2 diabetes in sex-stratified, age-adjusted, and calendar 
year-adjusted Poisson models for each jurisdiction. Using incidence and 
mortality, we constructed life tables for people of both sexes aged 20-100 years 
for each jurisdiction and at two timepoints 5 years apart in the period 2005-19 
where possible. Life expectancy from a given age was computed as the area under 
the survival curves and lifetime lost was calculated as the difference between 
the expected lifetime of people with versus without type 2 diabetes at a given 
age. Lifetime risk was calculated as the proportion of each cohort who developed 
type 2 diabetes between the ages of 20 years and 100 years. We estimated 95% CIs 
using parametric bootstrapping.
FINDINGS: Across all study cohorts from the 23 jurisdictions (total person-years 
1 577 234 194), there were 5 119 585 incident cases of type 2 diabetes, 
4 007 064 deaths in those with type 2 diabetes, and 11 854 043 deaths in those 
without type 2 diabetes. The lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes ranged from 16·3% 
(95% CI 15·6-17·0) for Scottish women to 59·6% (58·5-60·8) for Singaporean men. 
Lifetime risk declined with time in 11 of the 15 jurisdictions for which two 
timepoints were studied. Among people with type 2 diabetes, the highest life 
expectancies were found for both sexes in Japan in 2017-18, where life 
expectancy at age 20 years was 59·2 years (95% CI 59·2-59·3) for men and 64·1 
years (64·0-64·2) for women. The lowest life expectancy at age 20 years with 
type 2 diabetes was observed in 2013-14 in Lithuania (43·7 years [42·7-44·6]) 
for men and in 2010-11 in Latvia (54·2 years [53·4-54·9]) for women. Life 
expectancy in people with type 2 diabetes increased with time for both sexes in 
all jurisdictions, except for Spain and Scotland. The life expectancy gap 
between those with and without type 2 diabetes declined substantially in Latvia 
from 2010-11 to 2015-16 and in the USA from 2009-10 to 2014-15. Years of life 
lost to type 2 diabetes ranged from 2·5 years (Latvia; 2015-16) to 12·9 years 
(Israel Clalit Health Services; 2015-16) for 20-year-old men and from 3·1 years 
(Finland; 2011-12) to 11·2 years (Israel Clalit Health Services; 2010-11 and 
2015-16) for 20-year-old women. With time, the expected number of years of life 
lost to type 2 diabetes decreased in some jurisdictions and increased in others. 
The greatest decrease in years of life lost to type 2 diabetes occurred in the 
USA between 2009-10 and 2014-15 for 20-year-old men (a decrease of 2·7 years).
INTERPRETATION: Despite declining lifetime risk and improvements in life 
expectancy for those with type 2 diabetes in many high-income jurisdictions, the 
burden of type 2 diabetes remains substantial. Public health strategies might 
benefit from tailored approaches to continue to improve health outcomes for 
people with diabetes.

Mango is a climacteric fruit and is prone to high perishability. The rapid 
softening and ripening (due to degradation and disassembly of cell wall 
polysaccharides) are the major limitations in extending the storability of the 
harvested mango fruits. Various types of gum-based edible coatings have been 
reported for the shelf life extension of mango fruits. Tragacanth gum (TCG) also 
has appropriate coating properties. Its use as an edible coating has been 
reported on certain fruits. However, the effect of TCG coating in the regulation 
of harvested mango fruits ripening and softening has not been reported yet. So, 
the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of TCG (control, 0.5 %, 
1 % and 1.5 %) coating on postharvest softening and ripening of harvested mango 
fruits. TCG coating affected the ripening and softening of mango in a 
dose-dependent manner. Results exhibited that mango fruits coated with 1.5 % TCG 
showed substantially lower disease incidence and weight loss. The 1.5 % 
TCG-coated mangoes showed substantially lower ethylene biosynthesis and 
respiration rate peaks as well as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide 
contents compared with the control. In the same way, 1.5 % TCG-coated mango 
fruits had markedly higher total chlorophyll content and lower L*, b* and a* 
along with substantially lower total carotenoids in peel tissues. Mango fruits 
coated with 1.5 % TCG exhibited markedly lower water-soluble pectin and higher 
chelate-soluble pectin, Na2CO3-soluble pectin, protopectin, cellulose and 
hemicellulose in flesh tissues compared with control. The activity of 
polygalacturonase (PG), cellulase (CX), pectin methylesterase (PME), 
β-galactosidase (β-Gal) and β-glucosidase (β-Glu) were significantly lower in 
flesh of 1.5 % TCG treated fruits along with substantially higher firmness in 
contrast with control. In addition, 1.5 % TCG coating treatment showed 
significantly higher activity of antioxidative enzymes and delayed the increase 
in soluble solids content (SSC) and ripening index (RI) along with considerably 
higher titratable acidity (TA) compared with the untreated control. So, 
pre-storage TCG based edible coating (1.5 %) could be applied to delay ripening 
and softening in mango fruit industry under postharvest ambient conditions.

PURPOSE: Anticancer treatment-related toxicities can impact morbidity and 
mortality, hamper the administration of treatment, worsen the quality of life 
and increase the burden on the healthcare system. Therefore, their prompt 
identification is crucial. NICSO (Italian Network for Supportive Care in Cancer) 
conducted a nationwide randomized trial to evaluate the role of a planned, 
weekly phone-based nurse monitoring intervention to prevent and treat 
chemotherapy, targeted therapy- and immunotherapy-related toxicities. Here, we 
report the results from the chemotherapy arm.
METHODS: This was a nationwide, randomized, open-label trial conducted among 29 
Italian centers (NCT04726020) involving adult patients with breast, colon, or 
lung cancer and a life expectancy ≥6 months receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Patients received either a weekly nurse monitoring phone call and an educational 
leaflet reporting practical advice about prevention and treatment of toxicities 
(experimental group) or the educational leaflet only (control group).
RESULTS: The addition of a nurse monitoring intervention may help reduce time 
spent with severe toxicities (grade ≥3), particularly those less frequently 
reported in clinical practice, such as fatigue. When considering grade 1-2 AEs, 
times with mild/moderate diarrhea, mucositis, fatigue and pain were shorter in 
the experimental arm. Time spent without AEs was significantly longer in the 
experimental arms for all the toxicities. The requirement for special medical 
attention was comparable between groups.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests the need for implementing a better system of 
toxicity assessment and management for patients treated with adjuvant 
chemotherapy to promote effective preventive and/or therapeutic intervention 
against these events.

Delaying ripening using 1-MCP reveals chilling injury symptom development at the 
putative chilling threshold temperature for mature green banana.

Storage at the putative chilling threshold temperature (CTT) to avoid chilling 
injury still limits postharvest handling of tropical fruit like banana in that 
ripening may occur at the CTT. To determine whether chilling injury (CI) 
symptoms would develop in mature green (MG) banana fruit if the CTT exposure was 
extended by inhibiting ethylene action and thus ripening, 1-methylcyclopropene 
(1-MCP) was applied. Individual 'fingers' from multiple 'clusters' of MG bananas 
were either immersed in water or 50 μg L-1 1-MCP (a.i.) solution and each 
treatment was divided into three subgroups for storage at 5.0°C (severe CI), 
13.0°C (mild CI), or 14.0°C (CTT) ± 0.1°C. 1-MCP delayed ripening in terms of 
color change for 10 days for fruit stored at the CTT. Ethylene production by 
fruit at 5.0°C remained around 0.04 ng kg-1 s-1 with no obvious increase during 
31-day storage. Ethylene production at 14.0°C (-1-MCP/+1-MCP) increased on Day 
33 while increasing on Day 38 for 13.0°C fruit without 1-MCP and on Day 39 for 
fruit with 1-MCP. Peak climacteric ethylene occurred on Days 44 and 39 for 13.0 
and 14.0°C fruit without 1-MCP, respectively, and on Days 59 and 51 for 13.0°C 
and 14.0°C 1-MCP-treated fruit, respectively. As hypothesized, longer exposure 
of MG banana fruit to the CTT of 14.0°C without onset of ripening as was allowed 
by prior 1-MCP treatment allowed CI to develop at that normally non-chilling 
temperature. Vascular browning was the first visual and most sensitive CI 
symptom in the experiment and was observed on Day 4 at 5.0°C, Day 10 at 13.0°C, 
Day 19 at 14.0°C without 1-MCP, and on Day 28 at 14.0°C with 1-MCP. Using a 
1-MCP pre-treatment to remove the influence of ethylene from bananas stored at 
13°C or 14°C also resulted in slight reduction in vascular browning severity. In 
conclusion, a putative safe temperature may become a CI temperature if the 
shelf-life-limiting factor is removed, allowing longer exposure. Chilling at the 
CTT caused relatively mild injury on fruit, and vascular browning is a sensitive 
indicator of CI status, while the light-adapted quantum yield of photosystem II 
[Y(II)] could be a non-destructive indicator of early CI stress in MG banana. 
Fruit at 13.0/14.0°C developed CI symptoms slightly later with 1-MCP than 
without 1-MCP. This suggests that ethylene might be involved in early CI symptom 
development.

validity.

Psychometrically sound instruments that assess temporal dynamics of creative 
abilities are limited. The Ambulatory Battery of Creativity (ABC) is designed to 
assess creative ideation performance multiple times in everyday life and was 
proven to capture the intra-individual dynamic of creative abilities reliably 
and validly. The present ambulatory study aimed to replicate and extend the 
psychometric evidence of the novel ABC. Sixty-nine participants worked on the 
ABC during a 5-day ambulatory assessment protocol. Each day, participants 
completed six randomly presented items of the verbal and the figural ABC. 
Matching previous psychometric analyses, the results indicated good 
between-person (≥0.80) and good within-person (≥0.72) reliability. Furthermore, 
evidence for between-person and within-person validity of the ABC was obtained. 
Performance in the verbal and the figural ABC were interrelated and correlated 
with an independent measure of creative potential. The verbal ABC was further 
associated with openness, self-reported creative behavior, creative activities, 
and creative achievements, thus providing additional evidence of construct 
validity, especially for the verbal ABC. Finally, the verbal and the figural ABC 
yielded convincing within-person validity: Longer response times and higher 
subjective originality ratings were associated with more original ideas. This 
replication and extension of the ABC's psychometric properties indicates that it 
enables a reliable and valid assessment of moment-to-moment fluctuations of 
creative ideation abilities in everyday life, which may facilitate the 
investigation of exciting new research questions related to dynamic aspects of 
creative ability.

The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) represents the greatest 
increase in marine animal biodiversity ever recorded. What caused this 
transformation is heavily debated. One hypothesis states that rising atmospheric 
oxygen levels drove the biodiversification based on the premise that animals 
require oxygen for their metabolism. Here, we present uranium isotope data from 
a Middle Ordovician marine carbonate succession that shows the steepest rise in 
generic richness occurred with global marine redox stability. Ocean oxygenation 
ensued later and could not have driven the biodiversification. Stable marine 
anoxic zones prevailed during the maximum increase in biodiversity 
(Dapingian-early Darriwilian) when the life expectancy of evolving genera 
greatly increased. Subsequently, unstable ocean redox conditions occurred 
together with a marine carbon cycle disturbance and a decrease in relative 
diversification rates. Therefore, we propose that oceanic redox stability was a 
factor in facilitating the establishment of more resilient ecosystems allowing 
marine animal life to radiate.

Bronchiectasis (not related to cystic fibrosis) is a chronic lung disease caused 
by a range of etiologies but characterized by abnormal airway dilatation, 
recurrent respiratory symptoms, impaired quality of life and reduced life 
expectancy. Patients typically experience episodes of chronic wet cough and 
recurrent pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization. Early diagnosis and 
management of childhood bronchiectasis are essential to prevent respiratory 
decline, optimize quality of life, minimize pulmonary exacerbations, and 
potentially reverse bronchial disease. Disease monitoring potentially allows for 
(1) the early detection of acute exacerbations, facilitating timely 
intervention, (2) tracking the rate of disease progression for prognostic 
purposes, and (3) quantifying the response to therapies. This narrative review 
article will discuss methods for monitoring disease progression in children with 
bronchiectasis, including lung imaging, respiratory function, patient-reported 
outcomes, respiratory exacerbations, sputum biomarkers, and nutritional 
outcomes.

In the last decades, improvements in the average life expectancy in the world 
population have been associated with a significant increase in the proportion of 
elderly people, in parallel with a higher prevalence of non-communicable 
diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes. As the kidney is a common target 
organ of a variety of diseases, an adequate evaluation of renal function in the 
approach of this population is of special relevance. It is also known that the 
kidneys undergo aging-related changes expressed by a decline in the glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR), reflecting the loss of kidney function, either by a 
natural senescence process associated with healthy aging or by the length of 
exposure to diseases with potential kidney damage. Accurate assessment of renal 
function in the older population is of particular importance to evaluate the 
degree of kidney function loss, enabling tailored therapeutic interventions. The 
present review addresses a relevant topic, which is the effects of aging on 
renal function. In order to do that, we analyze and discuss age-related 
structural and functional changes. The text also examines the different options 
for evaluating GFR, from the use of direct methods to the implementation of 
several estimating equations. Finally, this manuscript supports clinicians in 
the interpretation of GFR changes associated with age and the management of the 
older patients with decreased kidney function.

Along with the significant elongation in the average life expectancy of patients 
with cystic fibrosis (CF), there are still significant discrepancies in the 
height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of patients compared to controls 
without CF. The correlation between hormones that regulate appetite and body fat 
mass may be an additional factor in weight loss or poor weight gain in CF 
patients. Our objective was to estimate serum concentrations of leptin and 
neuropeptide Y in patients with CF as well as to assess correlations between 
studied hormones and the clinical parameters of CF. Leptin and neuropeptide Y 
serum concentrations after an overnight fast were measured using an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All study participants had anthropometric 
tests and spirometry. In addition, fasting serum lipid profile was also 
analyzed. Fasting leptin levels in CF were significantly higher in patients with 
CF patients (13.9 ± 6.9 vs. 6.5 ± 2.6 ng/mL, p < 0.001) compared to controls. 
There were no differences in leptin concentration between female and male CF 
participants (15.7 ± 7.8 vs. 12.2 ± 5.6 ng/mL, p = 0.13). Leptin was correlated 
with age (R = 0.64, p < 0.001), BMI (R = 0.65, p < 0.001), spirometry results (R 
= -0.49, p < 0.01), and body fat (R = 0.5, p < 0.05). There were no differences 
in neuropeptide Y concentration between participants with CF and controls as 
well as neuropeptide Y was not correlated with any studied parameters. The 
results of our study suggest that weight loss may be associated with a decreased 
level of leptin, while reduced pulmonary function in CF may be related to an 
elevated level of leptin.

OBJECTIVES: With the postponement in age at marriage, increase in life 
expectancy, and acceptance of divorce in China, the marital duration in each 
state has changed gradually. This study seeks to depict the trends and gender 
differences of marital duration in China from 1982 to 2015.
DESIGN: We calculated and depicted the trends of and gender differences in 
marital duration, including single, marriage, divorce, widowhood duration and 
the proportion of each duration to the remaining life expectancy at 15.
RESULTS: The single duration of Chinese men and women was slightly reduced and 
then extended, with that of men longer than women, showing a narrowing trend in 
gender difference. The marriage duration of Chinese men and women is 
lengthening, with that of women longer than men, demonstrating a widening gap in 
gender difference. However, the proportion of marriage duration in life 
expectancy at age 15 increased and then declined, with that of men higher than 
women. The divorce duration of Chinese men and women slightly reduced and then 
lengthened, but men tend to stay divorced for longer periods than women, and the 
gender difference is narrowing. The widowhood duration of Chinese men and women 
is shortening, with women having longer widowhood than men, and the gender 
difference has been shrinking.
CONCLUSIONS: With the socio-economic and demographic transition, the marital 
duration in each state has changed gradually, and will have an important impact 
on fertility level and pension burden.

BACKGROUND: Forty years from the seminal work of Welsh GP Julian Tudor Hart on 
the Inverse Care Law, inequalities in health and healthcare remain deeply 
embedded in Wales. There is a wider gap (over 17 years) in healthy life 
expectancy between people living in the most and least deprived neighborhoods in 
Wales. This health inequality is reflected in additional healthcare use. In this 
study we estimate the cost of inequality associated with this additional 
healthcare use to the publicly funded National Health Service (NHS) in Wales.
METHODS: We retrieved administrative data on all NHS inpatient admissions, 
outpatient and accident and emergency attendances in Wales between April 2018 
and March 2019 from Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW). Hospital service use 
data were translated to costs using Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) and health 
service specific unit cost data and linked with area level mid-year population 
and deprivation indices in order to calculate the healthcare costs associated 
with socioeconomics deprivation.
RESULTS: Inequality in healthcare use between people from more and less deprived 
neighborhoods was associated with an additional cost of £322 million per year to 
the NHS in Wales, accounting for 8.7% of total NHS hospital expenditure in the 
country. Emergency inpatient admissions made up by far the largest component of 
this additional cost contributing £247.4 million, 77% of the total. There are 
also substantial costs of inequality for A&E attendances and outpatient visits, 
though not maternity services. Elective admissions overall have a negative cost 
of inequality, since among men aged 50-75 and women aged 60-70, elective 
utilization is actually negatively associated with deprivation.
CONCLUSION: There are wide inequalities in health and healthcare use between 
people living in more deprived neighborhoods and those living in less deprived 
neighborhoods in Wales. Tackling health inequality through a combination of 
health promotion and early intervention policies targeted toward deprived 
communities could yield substantial improvement in health and wellbeing, as well 
as savings for the Welsh NHS through reduced use of emergency hospital care.

University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

PURPOSE: Worldwide, about 40% of women will experience pelvic organ prolapse 
(POP), and this proportion is expected to increase with the aging of the 
population. We investigated the global, regional and national influenza burden 
in the past 30 years through the age and sociodemographic index (SDI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) 2019 database for 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019. 
Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to explore the 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized disability adjusted 
life years (AS-DALYs) trends, and the corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UI). In addition, the time cut-off points of 1990 and 2019 were used to 
separately analyze the incidence rate and DALYs.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global ASIR and AS-DALYs for POP were 316.19 (95%UI: 
259.84-381.84) and 10.37 (95%UI: 5.79-17.99) per 100,000 population, 
respectively. Moreover, from 1990 to 2019, the ASR of both showed a downward 
trend, and EAPCs were -0.46 (95%CI: -0.52 to -0.4) and -0.53 (95%CI: -0.58 to 
-0.47), respectively. In addition, DALYs of POP also showed a downward trend in 
most regions and countries with high SDI. From 1990 to 2019, the global 
incidence rate and DALYs rate were highest in the 65-75 and ≥60 age groups, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Over the past three decades, the incidence and DALY of POP have been 
decreasing from 1990 to 2019. However, POP remains a major health problem, 
especially among females in less developed countries. Primary and secondary 
prevention measures of POP should be integrated into the practice of healthcare 
professionals dealing with aging women.

In clinical practice, there are often discrepancies between the oncological 
prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and the actual clinical 
course. This study aimed to check with our collective how reliably the current 
classifications (Miettinen, Fletcher) predict the prognosis of GIST and to 
evaluate whether an extension of the classifications by the parameter 
proliferation activity could make sense. This prospective study enrolled 58 
patients who underwent surgery on GIST from 01/2006 to 12/2016. The 
postoperative course (curation, recurrence, progress) was correlated with the 
identified risk classification and the proliferative activity. Coincidences with 
other tumors were strikingly common in patients with GIST (43%). Based on the 
risk group assignment of GIST, no assessment of the probability of the 
occurrence of second neoplasia could be derived. Individual patients were under- 
or over-graduated concerning the assessment of biological behavior based on the 
standard risk classifications. The inclusion of proliferative activity did not 
allow for a more precise predictive power - neither to the risk of recurrence 
and metastasis nor to the development of a second neoplasia. The study showed 
that there is currently no parameter or logarithm that reliably predicts the 
biological behavior of GIST. Due to the frequency of coincidence of second 
neoplasia and (rare) distant metastases, for everyday clinical practice, 
appropriate staging diagnostic and regular follow-up care should also be used 
for benign GIST.

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of inborn errors of immunity 
(IEI) characterized by severe T- and/or B-lymphopenia. At birth, there are 
usually no clinical signs of the disease, but in the first year of life, often 
in the first months the disease manifests with severe infections. Timely 
diagnosis and treatment play a crucial role in patient survival. In Ukraine, the 
expansion of hemostatic stem cell transplantation and the development of a 
registry of bone marrow donors in the last few years have created opportunities 
for early correction of IEI and improving the quality and life expectancy of 
children with SCID. For the first time in Ukraine, we initiated a pilot study on 
newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency and T-cell lymphopenia by 
determining T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and kappa-deleting 
recombination excision circles (KRECs). The analysis of TREC and KREC was 
performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by analysis 
of melting curves in neonatal dry blood spots (DBS). The DBS samples were 
collected between May 2020 and January 2022. In total, 10,350 newborns were 
screened. Sixty-five blood DNA samples were used for control: 25 from patients 
with ataxia-telangiectasia, 37 - from patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome, 
1 - with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, 2 - with SCID (JAK3 deficiency and DCLRE1C 
deficiency). Retest from the first DBS was provided in 5.8% of patients. New 
sample test was needed in 73 (0.7%) of newborns. Referral to confirm or rule out 
the diagnosis was used in 3 cases, including one urgent abnormal value. CID 
(TlowB+NK+) was confirmed in a patient with the urgent abnormal value. The 
results of a pilot study in Ukraine are compared to other studies (the referral 
rate 1: 3,450). Approbation of the method on DNA samples of children with 
ataxia-telangiectasia and Nijmegen syndrome showed a high sensitivity of TRECs 
(a total of 95.2% with cut-off 2000 copies per 106 cells) for the detection of 
these diseases. Thus, the tested method has shown its effectiveness for the 
detection of T- and B-lymphopenia and can be used for implementation of newborn 
screening for SCID in Ukraine.

Management of partial hand amputations is a notable clinical challenge. 
Historically, myoelectric prostheses have not allowed for independent digital 
control, resulting in unsatisfactory function and high rejection rates among 
upper extremity amputees. The Starfish Procedure was developed for patients who 
sustained loss of multiple digits through the level of the base of the proximal 
phalanx or distal metacarpal. The procedure involves the pedicled transfer of 1 
or more dorsal interosseous muscles to a subcutaneous location. This allows for 
a myoelectric sensor to capture the signals generated by these transferred 
muscles, thereby enabling intuitive, independent, digital prosthetic flexion and 
extension. In this article, we detail the relevant anatomy, indications, and 
technique for performing the Starfish Procedure. Given our patients' promising 
outcomes to date, we hope this technique paper will encourage upper extremity 
surgeons of all training backgrounds to perform this relatively straightforward 
procedure, thereby allowing patients with life-altering finger amputations to 
regain meaningful function by enhancing control of digital prostheses.

OBJECTIVE: Improvement in the quality of life is reflected in the narrowing of 
the gap between health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) and life expectancy (LE). 
The effect of megacity expansion on narrowing the gap is rarely reported. This 
study aimed to disclose this potential relationship.
METHODS: Annual life tables were constructed from identified death records and 
population counts from multiple administrative sources in Guangzhou, China, from 
2010 to 2020. Joinpoint regression was used to evaluate the temporal trend. 
Generalized principal component analysis and multilevel models were applied to 
examine the county-level association between the gap and social determinants.
RESULTS: Although LE and HALE in megacities are increasing steadily, their gap 
is widening. Socio-economic and health services are guaranteed to narrow this 
gap. Increasing personal wealth, a growing number of newborns and healthy 
immigrants, high urbanization, and healthy aging have helped in narrowing this 
gap.
CONCLUSION: In megacities, parallel LE and HALE growth should be highly 
considered to narrow their gap. Multiple social determinants need to be 
integrated as a whole to formulate public health plans.

Laser-Induced Action Potential-Like Measurements of Cardiomyocytes on 
Microelectrode Arrays for Increased Predictivity of Safety Pharmacology.

Life-threatening drug-induced cardiac arrhythmia is often preceded by prolonged 
cardiac action potentials (AP), commonly accompanied by small proarrhythmic 
membrane potential fluctuations. The shape and time course of the repolarizing 
fraction of the AP can be pivotal for the presence or absence of arrhythmia. 
Microelectrode arrays (MEA) allow easy access to cardiotoxic compound effects 
via extracellular field potentials (FP). Although a powerful and 
well-established tool in research and cardiac safety pharmacology, the FP 
waveform does not allow to infer the original AP shape due to the extracellular 
recording principle and the resulting intrinsic alternating current (AC) 
filtering. A novel device, described here, can repetitively open the membrane of 
cardiomyocytes cultivated on top of the MEA electrodes at multiple cultivation 
time points, using a highly focused nanosecond laser beam. The laser poration 
results in transforming the electrophysiological signal from FP to 
intracellular-like APs (laser-induced AP, liAP) and enables the recording of 
transcellular voltage deflections. This intracellular access allows a better 
description of the AP shape and a better and more sensitive classification of 
proarrhythmic potentials than regular MEA recordings. This system is a 
revolutionary extension to the existing electrophysiological methods, permitting 
accurate evaluation of cardiotoxic effect with all advantages of MEA-based 
recordings (easy, acute, and chronic experiments, signal propagation analysis, 
etc.).

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the burden of osteoarthritis (OA) associated with high 
body mass index (BMI) across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: This study extracted global, regional, and national data on years lived 
with disability (YLD) of OA associated with high BMI from GBD 2019. The YLD 
burden of OA associated with high BMI was systematically analyzed by age, SDI, 
sex, and EAPC.
