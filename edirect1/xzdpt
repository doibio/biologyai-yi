Local, regional and global targets have been set to halt marine biodiversity 
loss. Europe has set its own policy targets to achieve Good Environmental Status 
(GES) of marine ecosystems by implementing the Marine Strategy Framework 
Directive (MSFD) across member states. We combined an extensive dataset across 
five Mediterranean ecoregions including 26 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), their 
reference unprotected areas, and a no-trawl case study. Our aim was to assess if 
MPAs reach GES, if their effects are local or can be detected at ecoregion level 
or up to a Mediterranean scale, and which are the ecosystem components driving 
GES achievement. This was undertaken by using the analytical tool NEAT (Nested 
Environmental status Assessment Tool), which allows an integrated assessment of 
the status of marine systems. We adopted an ecosystem approach by integrating 
data from several ecosystem components: the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, 
macroalgae, sea urchins and fish. Thresholds to define the GES were set by 
dedicated workshops and literature review. In the Western Mediterranean, most 
MPAs are in good/high status, with P. oceanica and fish driving this result 
within MPAs. However, GES is achieved only at a local level, and the 
Mediterranean Sea, as a whole, results in a moderate environmental status. 
Macroalgal forests are overall in bad condition, confirming their status at 
risk. The results are significantly affected by the assumption that discrete 
observations over small spatial scales are representative of the total extension 
investigated. This calls for large-scale, dedicated assessments to realistically 
detect environmental status changes under different conditions. Understanding 
MPAs effectiveness in reaching GES is crucial to assess their role as sentinel 
observatories of marine systems. MPAs and trawling bans can locally contribute 
to the attainment of GES and to the fulfillment of the MSFD objectives. Building 
confidence in setting thresholds between GES and non-GES, investing in long-term 
monitoring, increasing the spatial extent of sampling areas, rethinking and 
broadening the scope of complementary tools of protection (e.g., Natura 2000 
Sites), are indicated as solutions to ameliorate the status of the basin.

INTRODUCTION: Orbital impalement is a serious and potentially life-threatening 
trauma if the brain or vessels at the base of the skull are affected. The 
authors report the results and aftermath of the management of a case of 
post-traumatic retention of an intra-orbital metallic foreign body.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-year-old boy was struck by a motorcycle while crossing a 
road. His head struck the handlebars of the motorcycle with a left 
facial-orbital impact point. The examination revealed a foreign body penetrating 
the orbit at the level of the left upper eyelid with limitation of adduction. 
The radiological assessment confirmed the intra-orbital presence of the foreign 
body with probable fracture of the inner wall of the eyeball. Surgical 
exploration through the palpebral wound revealed an intact eyeball and an 
incarceration of the medial rectus muscle by a fracture of the internal wall. 
After delicate and meticulous removal of the foreign body, hemostasis was 
ensured and the wound was sutured. The evolution was satisfactory, without 
sequelae or visual prejudice.
DISCUSSION: Imaging, i.e. a CT scan and a standard X-ray, is necessary to 
evaluate the lesions before adapting a therapeutic attitude. The choice of the 
approach for extraction must meet two cardinal concerns: extraction of the 
foreign body and minimal dissection or manipulation of the noble structures of 
the eye and its adnexa.
CONCLUSION: Intra-orbital foreign bodies are rare but potentially serious. The 
type of the foreign substance, its intra-orbital extension and related lesions, 
as well as the extraction process, all influence the prognosis.

BACKGROUND: hospital level healthcare in the home guided by comprehensive 
geriatric assessment (CGA) might provide a less costly alternative to 
hospitalisation for older people.
OBJECTIVE: to determine the cost-effectiveness of CGA admission avoidance 
hospital at home (HAH) compared with hospital admission.
DESIGN/INTERVENTION: a cost-effectiveness study alongside a randomised trial of 
CGA in an admission avoidance HAH setting, compared with admission to hospital.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: older people considered for a hospital admission in nine 
locations across the UK were randomised using a 2:1 randomisation schedule to 
admission avoidance HAH with CGA (N = 700), or admission to hospital with CGA 
when available (N = 355).
MEASUREMENTS: quality adjusted life years, resource use and costs at baseline 
and 6 months; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. The main 
analysis used complete cases.
RESULTS: adjusting for baseline covariates, HAH was less costly than admission 
to hospital from a health and social care perspective (mean -£2,265, 95% CI: 
-4,279 to -252), and remained less costly with the addition of informal care 
costs (mean difference -£2,840, 95% CI: -5,495 to -185). There was no difference 
in quality adjusted survival. Using multiple imputation for missing data, the 
mean difference in health and social care costs widened to -£2,458 (95% CI: 
-4,977 to 61) and societal costs remained significantly lower (-£3,083, 95% CI: 
-5,880 to -287). There was little change to quality adjusted survival.
CONCLUSIONS: CGA HAH is a cost-effective alternative to admission to hospital 
for selected older people.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The ability of L. monocytogenes to create biofilm 
results in the higher resistance to disinfectants and determines the need to 
search for effective methods of eradication. The aim of the study was to assess 
the level of L. monocytogenes contamination in the environment of a meat 
processing plant. The sensitivity of tested isolates to various antimicrobials 
used for disinfection purposes was also estimated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The samples were taken from raw materials, semi-finished 
and final products, as well as food contact surfaces inthe production hall and 
deli meat packaging department. The number of L. monocytogenes and the effect of 
eight different biocides on bacteria planktonic forms and biofilm formed on 
stainless steel and polypropylene was investigated. The effect of blood and 
albumin on L. monocytogenes resistance to disinfectants was also analysed.
RESULTS: The prevalence of L. monocytogenes on food contact surfaces was 
estimated at 2.93% (10 of 340 swabs taken). The samples of raw and processed 
products were not contaminated. Various disinfectants reduced the growth of 
planktonic L. monocytogenes forms at both tested concentrations 0.5% and 0.1% 
(irrespective of time exposure). The highest efficacy against L. monocytogenes 
biofilm was reported for agents containing hydrogen peroxide. The reduction of 
bacteria number ranged from 6.93-7.21 log CFU × cm-2, and was dependent on the 
surface type and time of agent application.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the effectiveness of various disinfectants against 
planktonic bacteria and Listeria biofilm was observed. For the majority of 
disinfectants, the extension of time exposure increased bacteria elimination 
from the biofilm. The presence of blood resulted in reduction of the 
antilisterial action of most of the disinfectants applied at low concentrations.

BACKGROUND: Systematic screening for TB has been recommended as a method to 
control TB on a global level; however, this involves significant costs that 
place a burden on the health system.METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of 
the existing economic literature on systematic screening for TB to summarise 
costs, cost-effectiveness and affordability, and the key factors that influence 
costs and cost-effectiveness. Specific populations of interest included the 
general population, children and close contacts of TB patients.RESULTS: We 
identified 21 studies that provided both cost and outcome data on TB screening 
among the populations of interest. All were from low- and middle-income 
settings. Studies were heterogenous in the intervention, and included costs and 
reported outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimates 
ranged from USD281 to USD698 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted 
among the general population, USD619/DALY averted among children and 
USD372-3,718/DALY averted among close contacts.CONCLUSION: Prevalence of TB 
among targeted high-risk groups was identified across the majority of studies as 
a driver of cost-effectiveness. The heterogeneity of the included costs and 
outcomes across the economic literature for systematic screening suggests a need 
for standardisation of included cost components and key economic evaluation 
methods to improve comparability and generalisability of results.

Metastatic breast cancer is the second most common cause of brain metastasis 
(BM), and this problem is particularly marked for the amplified HER2 subtype 
(HER2+), with a cumulative incidence reaching up to 49 % in the ER-/HER2+ 
subgroup. Literature review shows that therapeutic progress has been major since 
the marketing of systemic anti-HER2+ treatments, with life expectancies now 
relatively unaffected by brain development. The recommended treatments are, on 
the one hand, specific treatment for brain development and, on the other hand, 
appropriate systemic treatment. Regarding local treatments, we will always favor 
surgery when possible, especially for large metastases, and stereotaxic 
radiotherapy, possibly iterative. One should be wary of whole brain irradiation 
which has never been shown to improve overall survival, but which is clearly 
associated with more cognitive toxicities. All the systemic anti-HER2 treatments 
currently on the market have shown efficacy on BM from HER2+ breast cancer and 
must therefore be chosen above all on the basis of their potential activity on 
the systemic disease at the time of cerebral evolution. If BM evolution happen 
without concomitant systemic progression, and local treatment can control it, it 
is not recommended to change the current medical treatment. Finally, randomized 
clinical studies opened to patients with active brain disease are starting to be 
published. The first of them showed the benefit of the triple combination 
tucatinib-trastuzumab-capecitabine in this context.

The aim of this scoping review was to investigate ultrasound imaging (USI) 
acquisition procedures and guidelines used to assess the first 
metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ). MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED and SPORTDiscus were 
systematically searched in May 2021. Studies were included if they used 
grey-scale USI or power Doppler and reported a USI procedure to assess the first 
MTPJ. Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent assessors. 
The scoping review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR). A total of 403 citations were identified for screening, with 36 
articles included in the final analysis. There was wide variation in USI 
acquisition procedures used to evaluate the first MTPJ. Inconsistencies in 
reporting may be attributable to the number of elements the USI acquisition 
procedure encompasses, which include the model of the USI device, the type of 
transducer, USI modalities and settings, patient position, transducer 
orientation, surfaces scanned and the scanning technique used. The review found 
inconsistencies against international guidelines and limited implementation of 
consensus-based recommendations to guide image acquisition. Current guidelines 
require further refinement of anatomical reference points to establish a 
standardised USI acquisition procedure, subsequently improving interpretability 
and reproducibility between USI studies that evaluate the first MTPJ.

BACKGROUND: Female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) has a negative effect on female 
sexual functioning and with an increasing life expectancy female sexual 
dysfunction caused by POP will be an arising global issue.
AIM: Improvement in female sexual functioning, measured with the Pelvic Organ 
Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire IUGA-Revised (PISQ-IR), 
24-months after pessary or surgery, for both sexually active (SA) and sexually 
inactive women (NSA) presenting with POP.
METHODS: A multicenter prospective comparative cohort study was conducted in 22 
Dutch hospitals. Women referred with moderate to severe POP symptoms and POP 
stage ≥ 2 were included and chose either pessary therapy or surgical 
intervention. The PISQ-IR was filled in at baseline and 24-months, the delta of 
change was calculated and compared between both groups. Multivariate linear 
regression was performed to adjust for potential confounding factors in the 
association between the summary score of the PISQ-IR and therapy.
OUTCOMES: Change in PISQ-IR between pessary and surgical intervention.
RESULTS: The delta of change at 24-months was calculated for 198 women in the 
pessary group and 129 women in the surgery group. SA women in the surgery group 
reported statistically significant more improvement on the condition-specific 
(-0.19 95%CI -0.35; -0.03, P = .02), and condition-impact (-0.48 95%CI -0.69; 
-0.28, P < .001) domains as well as on the summary score (-0.15 95%CI -0.23; 
-0.08, P < .001) as compared to the pessary group. No significant differences 
between pessary and surgery were found on the domains for NSA women. After 
controlling for potential baseline confounders, surgery still had a 
statistically significant effect on the summary score (B = 0.08; 95%CI interval 
0.007-0.15, P = .03). Women having surgery had 2.62 times higher odds of 
changing from NSA to SA than pessary therapy.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: SA women who clearly express that POP-related symptoms 
limit their sexual functioning should be counseled that surgery results in a 
more remarkable improvement.
STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Our strengths include the large sample size, long-term 
follow-up, the use of the PISQ-IR as a validated outcome tool evaluating both SA 
and NSA women, and this study reflects real-life clinical practice that enhances

INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF, progressive 
fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (PF-ILD), are associated with a progressive 
loss of lung function and a poor prognosis. Treatment with antifibrotic agents 
can slow, but not halt, disease progression, and treatment discontinuation 
because of adverse events is common. Fibrotic diseases such as these can be 
mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which signals via six LPA receptors 
(LPA1-6). Signalling via LPA1 appears to be fundamental in the pathogenesis of 
fibrotic diseases. BMS-986278, a second-generation LPA1 antagonist, is currently 
in phase 2 development as a therapy for IPF and PF-ILD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, international trial will include adults with 
IPF or PF-ILD. The trial will consist of a 42-day screening period, a 26-week 
placebo-controlled treatment period, an optional 26-week active-treatment 
extension period, and a 28-day post-treatment follow-up. Patients in both the 
IPF (n=240) and PF-ILD (n=120) cohorts will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive 30 mg 
or 60 mg BMS-986278, or placebo, administered orally two times per day for 26 
weeks in the placebo-controlled treatment period. The primary endpoint is rate 
of change in per cent predicted forced vital capacity from baseline to week 26 
in the IPF cohort.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be conducted in accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines, Declaration of Helsinki principles, and local 
ethical and legal requirements. Results will be reported in a peer-reviewed 
publication.

Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is a life-threatening addition to the 
COVID-19 disease spectrum and is caused by an angioinvasive saprophytic 
opportunistic fungus. Early diagnosis is important to avoid disease spread and 
mortality. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging plays a major role in 
detection of intraorbital and intracranial extension. We present imaging 
findings of 15 patients with post-COVID-19 rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis 
who were diagnosed with invasive sinus mucormycosis at our institution and are 
currently undergoing treatment. All patients were diabetics, and 80% had a 
history of steroid intake during the course of COVID-19 treatment. There was a 
male preponderance (73.3%). The maxillary sinus was most commonly involved 
(86.7%). Orbital and intracranial invasion was seen in 73.3% and 60% of 
patients, respectively. The presence of retroantral, facial, infratemporal, and 
orbital fat stranding was an early sign of extrasinus spread. Other common sites 
of extrasinus involvement were the orbit and face, followed by the orbital apex, 
masticator space, pterygopalatine fossa, bone, skull base, cavernous sinus, 
brain, and internal carotid artery. In conclusion, early detection of extrasinus 
spread of mucormycosis by imaging is important so that aggressive treatment can 
be given and mortality can be reduced.

Introduction: Compared to the general population, people with severe mental 
illness (SMI) have a poorer health status and a higher mortality rate, with a 
10-20-year reduction in life expectancy. Excess mortality and morbidity in SMI 
have been explained by intertwined components. Inflammatory processes could 
increase the morbidity and mortality risk in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) 
because of a bidirectional interaction between BD and conditions related to 
inflammation. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the relationship between 
C-Reactive-Protein (CRP) and bipolar disorder severity. Methods: A retrospective 
observational study was conducted on 61 hospitalized patients with bipolar 
disorder. CRP was measured at admission to inpatient treatment (T0) and after 
seven days from the admission (T1). Clinical Global Impression for Depression, 
Mania and Overall Bipolar Illness were recorded at T0 and T1. Comparisons among 
the recorded CRP values were determined through the paired t-test. Correlations 
between CRP and CGI scores were determined through Spearman's correlation 
coefficient at T0 and T1. Results: A statistically significant decrease in CRP 
values was observed after 7 days of hospitalization (p < 0.001) and positive 
significant correlations emerged between CRP and CGI scores at T0 and T1. 
Conclusion: Patients admitted to the inpatient unit reported a statistically 
significant decrease of CRP values during the first 7 days of treatment. 
Although the direction of the relationship between BP severity and inflammation 
status continues to remain unclear, this study showed a relationship between the 
improvement of bipolar disease symptoms and the improvement of the inflammatory 
marker CRP.

Brain tumors are the most common and aggressive illness, with a relatively short 
life expectancy in their most severe form. Thus, treatment planning is an 
important step in improving patients' quality of life. In general, image methods 
such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 
ultrasound images are used to assess tumors in the brain, lung, liver, breast, 
prostate, and so on. X-ray images, in particular, are utilized in this study to 
diagnose brain tumors. This paper describes the investigation of the 
convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify brain tumors from X-ray images. 
It expedites and increases the reliability of the treatment. Because there has 
been a significant amount of study in this field, the presented model focuses on 
boosting accuracy while using a transfer learning strategy. Python and Google 
Colab were utilized to perform this investigation. Deep feature extraction was 
accomplished with the help of pretrained deep CNN models, VGG19, InceptionV3, 
and MobileNetV2. The classification accuracy is used to assess the performance 
of this paper. MobileNetV2 had the accuracy of 92%, InceptionV3 had the accuracy 
of 91%, and VGG19 had the accuracy of 88%. MobileNetV2 has offered the highest 
level of accuracy among these networks. These precisions aid in the early 
identification of tumors before they produce physical adverse effects such as 
paralysis and other impairments.

The social organization of many primate, bird and rodent species and the role of 
individuals within that organization are associated with specific individual 
physiological traits. However, this association is perhaps most pronounced in 
eusocial insects (e.g., termites, ants). In such species, genetically close 
individuals show significant differences in behavior, physiology, and life 
expectancy. Studies addressing the metabolic changes according to the social 
role are still lacking. We aimed at understanding how sociality could influence 
essential molecular processes in a eusocial insect, the black garden ant (Lasius 
niger) where queens can live up to ten times longer than workers. Using mass 
spectrometry-based analysis, we explored the whole metabolome of queens, 
nest-workers and foraging workers. A former proteomics study done in the same 
species allowed us to compare the findings of both approaches. Confirming the 
former results at the proteome level, we showed that queens had fewer 
metabolites related to immunity. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find 
any metabolite linked to reproduction in queens. Among the workers, foragers had 
a metabolic signature reflecting a more stressful environment and a more highly 
stimulated immune system. We also found that nest-workers had more 
digestion-related metabolites. Hence, we showed that specific metabolic 
signatures match specific social roles. Besides, we identified metabolites 
differently expressed among behavioral castes and involved in nutrient sensing 
and longevity pathways (e.g., sirtuins, FOXO). The links between such molecular 
pathways and aging being found in an increasing number of taxa, our results 
confirm and strengthen their potential universality.

Modern drug delivery technology began in 1952 with the advent of the Spansule® 
sustained-release capsule technology, which can deliver a drug for 12 h after 
oral administration through an initial immediate dose followed by the remaining 
released gradually. Until the 1980s, oral and transdermal formulations providing 
therapeutic durations up to 24 h for small molecules dominated the drug delivery 
field and the market. The introduction of Lupron Depot® in 1989 opened the door 
for long-acting injectables and implantables, extending the drug delivery 
duration from days to months and occasionally years. Notably, the new 
technologies allowed long-term delivery of peptide and protein drugs, although 
limited to parenteral administration. The introduction of the first PEGylated 
protein, Adagen®, in 1990 marked the new era of PEGylation, resulting in Doxil® 
(doxorubicin in PEGylated liposome) in 1995, Movantik® (PEGylated naloxone - 
naloxegol) in 2014, and Onpattro® (Patisiran - siRNA in PEGylated lipid 
nanoparticle) in 2018. Drug-polymer complexes were introduced, e.g., InFed® 
(iron-dextran complex injection) in 1974 and Abraxane® (paclitaxel-albumin 
complex) in 2005. In 2000, both Mylotarg™ (antibody-drug conjugate - gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin) and Rapamune® (sirolimus nanocrystal formulation) were introduced. 
The year 2000 also marked the launching of the National Nanotechnology 
Initiative by the U.S. government, which was soon followed by the rest of the 
world. Extensive work on nanomedicine, particularly formulations designed to 
escape from endosomes after being taken by tumor cells, along with PEGylation 
technology, ultimately resulted in the timely development of lipid nanoparticle 
formulations for COVID-19 vaccine delivery in 2020. While the advances in drug 
delivery technologies for the last seven decades are breathtaking, they are only 
the tip of an iceberg of technologies that have yet to be utilized in an 
approved formulation or even to be discovered. As life expectancy continues to 
increase, more people require long-term care for various diseases. Filling the 
current and future unmet needs requires innovative drug delivery technologies to 
overcome age-old familiar hurdles, e.g., improving water-solubility of poorly 
soluble drugs, overcoming biological barriers, and developing more efficient 
long-acting depot formulations. The lessons learned from the past are essential 
assets for developing future drug delivery technologies implemented into 
products. As the development of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated, meeting the 
unforeseen crisis of the uncertain future requires continuous cumulation of 
failures (as learning experiences), knowledge, and technologies. Conscious 
efforts of supporting diversified research topics in the drug delivery field are 
urgently needed more than ever.

Diseases from food of animal origin are common health problems in Ethiopia. A 
cross-sectional study was carried out to estimate health and economic burden, 
and to identify demographic factors associated with community awareness of 
foodborne zoonotic diseases in Amhara region, Ethiopia. Data was collected from 
435 households in three towns: Gondar, Lalibela and Debark. A retrospective data 
was also collected from health records in each town. The health burden due to 
zoonotic diseases was estimated at 0.2, 0.1 and 1.3 DALYs per household per year 
and at 73.2, 146.6 and 1,689.5 DALYs out of 100,000 populations per year in 
Gondar, Lalibela and Debark, respectively. The overall health burden due to 
foodborne zoonotic diseases (aggregated over the 435 households in the three 
towns) was estimated to be 89.9 DALYs per 100,000 populations per year. The 
economic impact of foodborne zoonotic diseases in the three towns of Amhara 
regional state was 278.98 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) (1ETB = 0.025 US Dollar) per 
household per year and 121,355.68 ETB per year. Costs of preventive measures 
followed by costs of patients' time made the highest contribution while costs of 
diagnosis made the lowest contribution to the total economic burden of foodborne 
zoonotic diseases. From a total of 435 respondents, 305 (70.1%) had known the 
presence of zoonotic diseases. Level of education, number of families in the 
house and income were highly associated with awareness of zoonosis. Although 
majority of respondents had known zoonotic diseases exists (70.1%) and disease 
can be acquired from animal source food (63.2%), the health and economic burden 
associated to foodborne zoonotic diseases are still high. Therefore, changing 
mindset and practical training aiming in controlling foodborne zoonotic diseases 
may be suggested to the community in the health improvement extension service.

Prevalence and incidence of neuromuscular conditions in the UK between 2000 and 
2019: A retrospective study using primary care data.

BACKGROUND: In the UK, large-scale electronic primary care datasets can provide 
up-to-date, accurate epidemiological information on rarer diseases, where 
specialist diagnoses from hospital discharges and clinic letters are generally 
well recorded and electronically searchable. Current estimates of the number of 
people living with neuromuscular disease (NMD) have largely been based on 
secondary care data sources and lacked direct denominators.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate trends in the recording of neuromuscular disease in UK 
primary care between 2000-2019.
METHODS: The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database was searched 
electronically to estimate incidence and prevalence rates (per 100,000) for a 
range of NMDs in each year. To compare trends over time, rates were age 
standardised to the most recent CPRD population (2019).
RESULTS: Approximately 13 million patients were actively registered in each 
year. By 2019, 28,230 active patients had ever received a NMD diagnosis (223.6), 
which was higher among males (239.0) than females (208.3). The most common 
classifications were Guillain-Barre syndrome (40.1), myasthenia gravis (33.7), 
muscular dystrophy (29.5), Charcot-Marie-Tooth (29.5) and inflammatory 
myopathies (25.0). Since 2000, overall prevalence grew by 63%, with the largest 
increases seen at older ages (≥65-years). However, overall incidence remained 
constant, though myasthenia gravis incidence has risen steadily since 2008, 
while new cases of muscular dystrophy fell over the same period.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime recording of many NMDs on primary care records exceed 
current estimates of people living with these conditions; these are important 
data for health service and care planning. Temporal trends suggest this number 
is steadily increasing, and while this may partially be due to better recording, 
it cannot be simply explained by new cases, as incidence remained constant. The 
increase in prevalence among older ages suggests increases in life expectancy 
among those living with NMDs may have occurred.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a global burden that 
reflects each country's unique condition. We used the National Health Insurance 
Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to decipher changes in the mortality and 
international survival rates and to determine the effectiveness of the 
pre-end-stage renal disease care program (pre-ESRD care program) to guide future 
health policies for ESKD.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of the NHIRD data along 
with records from the catastrophic illness certificate program of ESKD patients 
from 2010 to 2018.
