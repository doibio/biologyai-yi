BACKGROUND: In Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, an estimated 80% of 
newly-identified antiretroviral therapy (ART)-eligible patients are not engaged 
in ART. Delayed ART uptake ultimately translates into high rates of HIV 
morbidity, mortality, and transmission. To enhance HIV testing receipt and 
subsequent treatment uptake in Guangxi, the Chinese Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) executed a cluster-randomized trial to assess the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a streamlined HIV testing algorithm (the 
One4All intervention) in 12 county-level hospitals.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the One4All 
intervention delivered at county hospitals in Guangxi, China, compared to the 
current standard of care (SOC).
PERSPECTIVE: Health System.
TIME HORIZON: 1-, 5-and 25-years.
METHODS: We adapted a dynamic, compartmental HIV transmission model to simulate 
HIV transmission and progression in Guangxi, China and identify the economic 
impact and health benefits of implementing the One4All intervention in all 
Guangxi hospitals. The One4All intervention algorithm entails rapid 
point-of-care HIV screening, CD4 and viral load testing of individuals 
presenting for HIV screening, with same-day results and linkage to counselling. 
We populated the model with data from the One4All trial (CTN-0056), China CDC 
HIV registry and published reports. Model outcomes were HIV incidence, 
mortality, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the One4All intervention compared to SOC.
RESULTS: The One4All testing intervention was more costly than SOC (CNY 2,182 
vs. CNY 846), but facilitated earlier ART access, resulting in delayed disease 
progression and mortality. Over a 25-year time horizon, we estimated that 
introducing One4All in Guangxi would result in 802 averted HIV cases and 1629 
averted deaths at an ICER of CNY 11,678 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis 
revealed that One4All remained cost-effective at even minimal levels of 
effectiveness. Results were robust to changes to a range of parameters 
characterizing the HIV epidemic over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The One4All HIV testing strategy was highly cost-effective by WHO 
standards, and should be prioritized for widespread implementation in Guangxi, 
China. Integrating the intervention within a broader combination prevention 
strategy would enhance the public health response to HIV/AIDS in Guangxi.

Much of the published works assessing the reliability of smartphone goniometer 
apps (SG) have poor generalizability since the reliability was assessed in 
healthy subjects. No research has established the values for standard error of 
measurement (SEM) or minimal detectable change (MDC) which have greater clinical 
utility to contextualize the range of motion (ROM) assessed using the SG. This 
research examined the test-retest reproducibility, concurrent validity, SEM, and 
MDC values for the iPhone goniometer app (i-Goni; June Software Inc., v.1.1, San 
Francisco, CA) in assessing knee ROM in patients with knee osteoarthritis or 
those after total knee replacement. A total of 60 participants underwent data 
collection which included the assessment of active knee ROM using the i-Goni and 
the universal goniometer (UG; EZ Read Jamar Goniometer, Patterson Medical, 
Warrenville, IL), knee muscle strength, and assessment of pain and lower 
extremity disability using quadruple numeric pain rating scale (Q-NPRS) and 
lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), respectively. Intraclass correlation 
coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to assess the reproducibility of the knee 
ROM assessed using the i-Goni and UG. Bland and Altman technique examined the 
agreement between these knee ROM. The SEM and MDC values were calculated for 
i-Goni assessed knee ROM to characterize the error in a single score and the 
index of true change, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficient examined 
concurrent relationships between the i-Goni and other measures. The ICC values 
for the knee flexion/extension ROM were superior for i-Goni (0.97/0.94) compared 
with the UG (0.95/0.87). The SEM values were smaller for i-Goni assessed knee 
flexion/extension (2.72/1.18 degrees) compared with UG assessed knee 
flexion/extension (3.41/1.62 degrees). Similarly, the MDC values were smaller 
for both these ROM for the i-Goni (6.3 and 2.72 degrees) suggesting smaller 
change required to infer true change in knee ROM. The i-Goni assessed knee ROM 
showed expected concurrent relationships with UG, knee muscle strength, Q-NPRS, 
and the LEFS. In conclusion, the i-Goni demonstrated superior reproducibility 
with smaller measurement error compared with UG in assessing knee ROM in the 
recruited cohort. Future research can expand the inquiry for assessing the 
reliability of the i-Goni to other joints.

BACKGROUND: Central vein stenosis or occlusion is a common complication that can 
lead to significant morbidity and dysfunction of access in the hemodialysis 
patient. More lesions can develop over time, and preserving access becomes a 
challenge as life expectancy of the hemodialysis patient increases.
OBJECTIVES: The goal was to compare long-term results and determine the outcomes 
of open-cell stent versus closed-cell stent for central vein stenosis or 
occlusion in hemodialysis patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1997 to 2015, in 401 hemodialysis patients, stent 
placement for central vein stenosis or occlusion was performed if balloon 
angioplasty was unsatisfactory, due to elastic recoil or occurrence of 
restenosis within 3 months. When thrombus was present, primary stenting was 
performed. A total of 257 open-cell stents and 144 closed-cell stents were used. 
Angiographic findings including lesion site, central vein stenosis or occlusion, 
and presence of thrombosis and complication were evaluated. Primary patency rate 
and mean patency rate of the stent were compared between two stent groups by 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: For the open-cell stent group, 159 patients were diagnosed as central 
vein stenosis and 98 were occlusion. For the closed-cell stent group, 78 were 
stenosis and 66 were occlusion. There were two complications for central 
migration and two for procedure-related vein rupture. Open-cell stents and 
closed-cell stents had mean patency rates of 10.9 ± 0.80 months and 8.5 ± 10.87 
months, respectively (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: The open-cell stent is effective and its performance is higher than 
that obtained with the closed-cell stent for treating central vein stenosis or 
occlusion in hemodialysis patients.

Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal glycogen storage disease 
caused by acid α-glucosidase deficiency. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is 
the most severe form and is characterized by cardiomyopathy, respiratory 
distress, hepatomegaly, and skeletal muscle weakness. Untreated, IOPD generally 
results in death within the first year of life. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
with recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase (rhGAA) has been shown to markedly 
improve the life expectancy of patients with IOPD. However, the efficacy of ERT 
in patients with IOPD is affected by the presence of symptoms and cross-reactive 
immunologic material (CRIM) status. We have treated two siblings with IOPD with 
ERT at different ages: the first was symptomatic and the second was 
asymptomatic. The female proband (Patient 1) was diagnosed with IOPD and 
initiated ERT at 4 months of age. Her younger sister (Patient 2) was diagnosed 
with IOPD at 10 days of age and initiated ERT at Day 12. Patient 1, now 6 years 
old, is alive but bedridden, and requires 24-hour invasive ventilation due to 
gradually progressive muscle weakness. In Patient 2, typical symptoms of IOPD, 
including cardiac failure, respiratory distress, progressive muscle weakness, 
hepatomegaly and myopathic facial features were largely absent during the first 
12 months of ERT. Her cardiac function and mobility were well-maintained for the 
first 3 years, and she had normal motor development. However, she developed 
progressive hearing impairment and muscle weakness after 3 years of ERT. Both 
siblings have had low anti-rhGAA immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers during 
ERT and have tolerated the treatment well. These results suggest that initiation 
of ERT during the pre-symptomatic period can prevent and/or attenuate the 
progression of IOPD, including cardiomyopathy, respiratory distress, and muscle 
weakness for first several years of ERT. However, to improve the long-term 
efficacy of ERT for IOPD, new strategies for ERT for IOPD, e.g. modifying the 
enzyme to enhance uptake into skeletal muscle and/or to cross the blood brain 
barrier (BBB), will be required.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of most common malignancies and the 
leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Despite advances in targeted 
therapies, majority of NSCLC patients do not have targetable genomic 
alterations. Nevertheless, recent discovery that NSCLC is an immunogenic tumor 
type, and several breakthroughs in immunotherapies have led to rapid expansion 
of this new treatment modality in NSCLC with recent FDA approvals of programed 
death receptor-1 inhibitors, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Here, we 
review promising immunotherapeutic approaches in metastatic NSCLC, including 
checkpoint inhibitors, agents with other mechanisms of action, and immunotherapy 
combinations with other drugs. With advent of immunotherapy, therapeutic options 
in metastatic NSCLC are rapidly expanding with the hope to further expand life 
expectancy in metastatic lung cancer.

Invasive mole is a benign gestational trophoblastic disease that arises from the 
myometrial invasion of any gestational event via direct extension through tissue 
or vascular structures. Invasive mole (and other gestational trophoblastic 
diseases) may present with life-threatening complications including uterine 
perforation, excessive bleeding, acute hemoperitoneum, and abdominal pain. We 
report a case of invasive mole presenting as abdominal distention in a 
51-year-old perimenopausal woman (gravida 12, para 12, abortion 0). The patient 
was admitted to the gynecology clinic with a giant uterine mass filling the 
pelvic and abdominal cavity. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the 
literature of a gestational trophoblastic neoplasia presenting with uterine mass 
of 28 weeks' gestational size in this age group. Interestingly, complications 
such as uterine rupture or invasion of the adjacent structures (such as 
parametrial tissues or blood vessels) had not developed in our patient despite 
the considerable enlargement of the uterus.

INTRODUCTION: When oral or transdermal drug therapy in Parkinson's disease 
becomes less effective, there are three therapies using assisted devices that 
can reduce motor and non-motor complications: subcutaneous apomorphine infusion 
pump (SAIP), continuous levodopa/carbidopa duodenal infusion (LDI) and deep 
brain stimulation (DBS).
AIM: Conduct a comparative pharmacoeconomic analysis of the use of SAIP, with 
LDI and DBS. As a secondary objective arises discuss the profile of the ideal 
candidate for each of the technicals.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Information on life years gained and quality adjusted life 
years (QALY) according to Hoehn and Yahr scale was obtained, as well as data on 
costs and resource use for each of the alternatives. The perspective of the 
analysis was the National Health System and the time horizon was 5 years for 
costs and patient´s lifetime for utilities. Outcome measures used were life 
years gained and QALYs, and incremental cost/utility ratio for comparison.
RESULTS: Cost/utility ratio was obtained for each option: 31,956 euros/QALY for 
DBS, 38,249 euros/QALY for SAIP, and 75,206 euros/QALY for LDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results allow us to add information about effectiveness of 
different treatments, as these are presented in gain of years lived in full 
health (QALY). Data obtained contribute to decision making that determine 
planning and management of each case, without forgetting patient and neurologist 
preferences, as well as budgetary limitations.

BACKGROUND: Microvascular free tissue transfer has become the main technique 
used for head and neck reconstruction. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
free flap reconstruction for head and neck defects after oncologic resection for 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
METHODS: We developed a Markov model of the cost, quality of life, survival, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness of reconstruction with free tissue transfer 
compared with locoregional flaps. Health state probabilities and quality of life 
scores were determined from literature. Costs were determined from institutional 
experience. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years, costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: Free flap reconstruction was more costly than pedicled flap but 
associated with greater quality of life with no survival benefit. A value 
<$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was defined as cost-effective. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness for head and neck free flap reconstruction 
was below the threshold and, therefore, free flap reconstruction is 
cost-effective. Reconstruction was more cost-effective for patients with lower 
stage cancers: $4643 per QALY for stage I SCC, $8226 for stage II, $17,269 for 
stage III, and $23,324 for stage IV. Univariate sensitivity analysis showed the 
cost-effectiveness would remain <$50,000 for all stages of SCC for all variables 
except for QALY after locoregional reconstruction without complications.
CONCLUSION: Microsurgical head and neck reconstruction is cost-effective 
compared with locoregional flaps, even more so in patients with early-stage 
cancer. This finding supports the current practice of free flap head and neck 
reconstruction. Screening and early detection are important to optimize costs. ©

RATIONALE: Patients with malignant pleural effusions have significant dyspnea 
and shortened life expectancy. Indwelling pleural catheters allow patients to 
drain pleural fluid at home and can lead to autopleurodesis. The optimal 
drainage frequency to achieve autopleurodesis and freedom from catheter has not 
been determined.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an aggressive daily drainage strategy is 
superior to the current standard every other day drainage of pleural fluid in 
achieving autopleurodesis.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to either an aggressive drainage (daily 
drainage; n = 73) or standard drainage (every other day drainage; n = 76) of 
pleural fluid via a tunneled pleural catheter.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was the incidence of 
autopleurodesis following the placement of the indwelling pleural catheters. The 
rate of autopleurodesis, defined as complete or partial response based on 
symptomatic and radiographic changes, was greater in the aggressive drainage arm 
than the standard drainage arm (47% vs. 24%, respectively; P = 0.003). Median 
time to autopleurodesis was shorter in the aggressive arm (54 d; 95% confidence 
interval, 34-83) as compared with the standard arm (90 d; 95% confidence 
interval, 70 to nonestimable). Rate of adverse events, quality of life, and 
patient satisfaction were not significantly different between the two arms.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with malignant pleural effusion, daily drainage of 
pleural fluid via an indwelling pleural catheter led to a higher rate of 
autopleurodesis and faster time to liberty from catheter. Clinical trial 
registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00978939).

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
disease as a function of chronologic age and exposure to young children in US 
preterm infants.
METHODS: In the RSV Respiratory Events among Preterm Infants Outcomes and Risk 
Tracking (REPORT) study, preterm infants born at 32-35 weeks gestational age 
(wGA) were enrolled from 188 US clinics and followed September-May of 2009-2010 
or 2010-2011. Infants with medically-attended acute respiratory illness had 
nasal/pharyngeal swabs collected for viral testing. Results of RSV tests 
conducted during routine clinical care were also collected. Event rates during 
November-March were modeled as a function of chronologic age and birth month 
using Poisson regression and adjusting for other covariates. Rates were 
calculated overall and for infants with and without exposure to young siblings 
or daycare attendance. Of 3317 infants screened, 1646 were enrolled as a 
consecutive sample. Infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity, 
hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, life expectancy <6 months, 
or receiving or being considered for RSV immunoprophylaxis were excluded. 84% of 
patients completed the study. Demographics of the enrolled cohort were generally 
similar to those of US infants born at 32-35 wGA; infants 32-34 wGA, Hispanic 
infants, and infants of less-educated mothers were under-represented.
RESULTS: Among 1642 evaluable infants, outpatient RSV lower respiratory illness 
incidence was highest at older ages, whereas RSV hospitalization and intensive 
care unit (ICU) admission were highest at younger ages. In all instances, young 
child exposure was associated with higher RSV incidence. The highest RSV 
hospitalization and ICU rates occurred among February-born infants with young 
child exposure, at 19.0 (95% CI, 13.5-27.0) and 6.5 (95% CI, 5.6-7.6) per 100 
infant-seasons, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants have a substantially elevated risk of RSV disease. 
Young age and exposure to other young children identify those at greatest risk 
of severe RSV disease.

BACKGROUND: Racial discrimination is a pervasive social problem in several 
advanced countries such as the U.S., U.K., and Australia. Public health research 
also indicates a range of associations between exposure to racial discrimination 
and negative health, particularly, mental health including depression, anxiety, 
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the direct negative health 
impact of racial discrimination has not been costed so far although economists 
have previously estimated indirect non-health related productivity costs. In 
this study, we estimate the burden of disease due to exposure to racial 
discrimination and measure the cost of this exposure.
METHODS: Using prevalence surveys and data on the association of racial 
discrimination with health outcomes from a global meta-analysis, we apply a cost 
of illness method to measure the impact of racial discrimination. This estimate 
indicates the direct health cost attributable to racial discrimination and we 
convert the estimates to monetary values based on conventional parameters.
RESULTS: Racial discrimination costs the Australian economy 235,452 in 
disability adjusted life years lost, equivalent to $37.9 billion per annum, 
roughly 3.02% of annual gross domestic product (GDP) over 2001-11, indicating a 
sizeable loss for the economy.
CONCLUSION: Substantial cost is incurred due to increased prevalence of racial 
discrimination as a result of its association with negative health outcomes 
(e.g. depression, anxiety and PTSD). This implies that potentially significant 
cost savings can be made through measures that target racial discrimination. Our 
research contributes to the debate on the social impact of racial 
discrimination, with implications for policies and efforts addressing it.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy and ICU admission of elderly 
patients, mechanical ventilation, and weaning trials have increased worldwide.
METHODS: We evaluated a cohort with 479 subjects in the ICU. Patients younger 
than 18 y, tracheostomized, or with neurologic diseases were excluded, resulting 
in 331 subjects. Subjects ≥70 y old were considered elderly, whereas those <70 y 
old were considered non-elderly. Besides the conventional weaning indexes, we 
evaluated the performance of the integrative weaning index (IWI). The 
probability of successful weaning was investigated using relative risk and 
logistic regression. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used to 
calibrate and the C statistic was calculated to evaluate the association between 
predicted probabilities and observed proportions in the logistic regression 
model.
RESULTS: Prevalence of successful weaning in the sample was 83.7%. There was no 
difference in mortality between elderly and non-elderly subjects (P = .16), in 
days of mechanical ventilation (P = .22) and days of weaning (P = .55). In 
elderly subjects, the IWI was the only respiratory variable associated with 
mechanical ventilation weaning in this population (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The IWI was the independent variable found in weaning of elderly 
subjects that may contribute to the critical moment of this population in 
intensive care.

[Trans-Arterial Chemoembolization Therapy for Giant Cholangiocellular Carcinoma 
- A Single Case Report].

Here, we report a case of cholangiocellular carcinoma that was successfully 
treated with chemotherapy using a selective intra-arterial infusion technique. A 
65-year-old man presented to our hospital to obtain a second opinion regarding 
his disease. The patient was diagnosed with cholangiocellular carcinoma. The 
giant tumor was located in the porta hepatis. Some small nodules that were 
considered to be metastatic lesions were also observed in the surroundingarea. 
The tumor was judged by the primary physician to be too large for surgical 
treatment. Consequently, it was decided to treat the patient with trans-arterial 
chemoembolization(TACE)by selectingintra -arterial infusion of 5-FU, 
epirubicin(EPI), and mitomycin C prior to EPI-loaded HepaSphere(super-absorbent 
polymer microsphere)embolization, combined with concurrent systemic gemcitabine 
chemotherapy. After 5 sessions of the above treatment, the primary lesion 
reduced dramatically in size. In addition, the levels of CEA and CA19-9 
decreased from 34.2 to 2.6 ng/mL and 1,540 to 149 U/mL, respectively. Although 
the patient's initial life expectancy was only 3 to 6 months, his life 
expectancy was extended to as longas 26 months followingthe initiation of TACE. 
This case suggests that treatment with TACE together with systemic chemotherapy 
can be a powerful therapeutic option for patients with inoperable 
cholangiocellular carcinoma.

Tumor Metabolism, the Ketogenic Diet and β-Hydroxybutyrate: Novel Approaches to 
Adjuvant Brain Tumor Therapy.

Malignant brain tumors are devastating despite aggressive treatments such as 
surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The average life 
expectancy of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is approximately ~18 
months. It is clear that increased survival of brain tumor patients requires the 
design of new therapeutic modalities, especially those that enhance currently 
available treatments and/or limit tumor growth. One novel therapeutic arena is 
the metabolic dysregulation that results in an increased need for glucose in 
tumor cells. This phenomenon suggests that a reduction in tumor growth could be 
achieved by decreasing glucose availability, which can be accomplished through 
pharmacological means or through the use of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate 
ketogenic diet (KD). The KD, as the name implies, also provides increased blood 
ketones to support the energy needs of normal tissues. Preclinical work from a 
number of laboratories has shown that the KD does indeed reduce tumor growth in 
vivo. In addition, the KD has been shown to reduce angiogenesis, inflammation, 
peri-tumoral edema, migration and invasion. Furthermore, this diet can enhance 
the activity of radiation and chemotherapy in a mouse model of glioma, thus 
increasing survival. Additional studies in vitro have indicated that increasing 
ketones such as β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) in the absence of glucose reduction can 
also inhibit cell growth and potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and 
radiation. Thus, while we are only beginning to understand the pluripotent 
mechanisms through which the KD affects tumor growth and response to 
conventional therapies, the emerging data provide strong support for the use of 
a KD in the treatment of malignant gliomas. This has led to a limited number of 
clinical trials investigating the use of a KD in patients with primary and 
recurrent glioma.

BACKGROUND: Low back pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal 
conditions in the world. Many exercise treatment options exist but few 
interventions have utilised free-weight resistance training. To investigate the 
effects of a free-weight-based resistance training intervention on pain and 
lumbar fat infiltration in those with chronic low back pain.
METHODS: Thirty participants entered the study, 11 females (age=39.6±12.4 years, 
height=164 cm±5.3 cm, body mass=70.9±8.2 kg,) and 19 males (age=39.7±9.7 years, 
height=179±5.9 cm, body mass=86.6±15.9 kg). A 16-week, progressive, 
free-weight-based resistance training intervention was used. Participants 
completed three training sessions per week. Participants completed a Visual 
Analogue Pain Scale, Oswestry Disability Index and Euro-Qol V2 quality of life 
measure at baseline and every 4 weeks throughout the study. Three-dimensional 
kinematic and kinetic measures were used for biomechanical analysis of a 
bodyweight squat movement. Maximum strength was measured using an isometric 
mid-thigh pull, and lumbar paraspinal endurance was measured using a 
Biering-Sorensen test. Lumbar paraspinal fat infiltration was measured 
preintervention and postintervention using MRIs.
RESULTS: Postintervention pain, disability and quality of life were all 
significantly improved. In addition, there was a significant reduction in fat 
infiltration at the L3L4 and L4L5 levels and increase in lumbar extension time 
to exhaustion of 18%.
CONCLUSIONS: A free-weight-based resistance training intervention can be 
successfully utilised to improve pain, disability and quality of life in those 
with low back pain.

In recent years, with the higher median life expectancy, the number of hip and 
knee replacements has increased. Clinical examination and morphological studies 
are essential to evaluate patients with a painful arthroplasty. Nuclear medicine 
examinations also play an important role, their main usefulness being the 
exclusion of prosthesis complications. Nevertheless, conventional examinations, 
namely bone scan and white blood cell scintigraphy, can also identify 
complications, such as loosening and infection. This study describes the normal 
and pathologic patterns of a bone scan and exemplifies ten common situations 
that can cause pain in patients with hip or knee arthroplasty, other than 
loosening and infection, which can be disclosed on a bone scintigraphy. The ten 
situations that should be considered and looked for when analysing a bone scan 
are: referred pain, patellofemoral pain syndrome, fractures, fissures, 
abscess/haematoma, bone insert behaviour, heterotopic ossification, greater 
trochanter pseudarthrosis, osteoarthritis extension in a knee with an 
unicompartmental prosthesis, and systemic disease with bone involvement.

The Friend to Friend plus Patient Navigation Program (FTF+PN) aims to build an 
effective, sustainable infrastructure to increase breast and cervical screening 
rates for underserved women in rural Texas. The objective of this paper is to 
identify factors that (1) distinguish participants who chose patient navigation 
(PN) services from those who did not (non-PN) and (2) were associated with 
receiving a mammogram or Papanicolaou (Pap) test. This prospective study 
analyzed data collected from 2689 FTF+PN participants aged 18-99 years from 
March 1, 2012 to February 28, 2015 who self-identified as African American (AA), 
Latina, and non-Hispanic white (NHW). Women who were younger, AA or Latina, had 
less than some college education, attended a FTF+PN event because of the cost of 
screening or were told they needed a screening, and who reported a barrier to 
screening had higher odds of being a PN participant. Women who were PN 
participants and had more contacts with program staff had greater odds of 
receiving a mammogram and a Pap compared with their reference groups. Latina 
English-speaking women had lower odds of receiving a mammogram and a Pap 
compared with NHW women and Latina Spanish-speaking women had higher odds of 
receiving a Pap test compared with NHW women. Women with greater need chose PN 
services, and PN participants had higher odds of getting a screening compared 
with women who did not choose PN services. These results demonstrate the success 
of PN in screening women in rural Texas but also that racial/ethnic disparities 
in screening remain.

Pediococci are halophilic lactic acid bacteria, within the family 
Lactobacillaceae, which are involved in the fermentation of various salted and 
fermented foods, such as kimchi and jeotgal. In this study, a matrix-assisted 
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS method was developed 
for the rapid identification of species of the genus Pediococcus. Of the 130 
Pediococcus spectra aligned with the Biotyper taxonomy database, 122 isolates 
(93.9 %) yielded log scores <1.7, which means they were not identifiable. After 
registering the spectra of 11 reference strains of the genus Pediococcus, all of 
the isolates were correctly identified, of which 84 (64.6 %) and 46 (35.4 %) 
were identified at the species and genus level, respectively. In comparing food 
origins, no relationship was found between the bacterial characteristics and 
food environment. We were able to produce a Biotyper system for identification 
of members of the genus Pediococcus with locally extended Pediococcus reference 
strains. The MALDI-TOF MS method is fast, simple and reliable for discriminating 
between species in the genus Pediococcus and therefore will be useful for 
quality control in determining the spoilage of alcoholic beverages or in the 
production of fermented food.

BACKGROUND: The usefulness of aspirin to defend against cardiovascular disease 
in both primary and secondary settings is well recognized by the medical 
profession. Multiple studies also have found that daily aspirin significantly 
reduces cancer incidence and mortality. Despite these proven health benefits, 
aspirin use remains low among populations targeted by cardiovascular prevention 
guidelines. This article seeks to determine the long-term economic and 
population-health impact of broader use of aspirin by older Americans at higher 
risk for cardiovascular disease.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We employ the Future Elderly Model, a dynamic 
microsimulation that follows Americans aged 50 and older, to project their 
lifetime health and spending under the status quo and in various scenarios of 
expanded aspirin use. The model is based primarily on data from the Health and 
Retirement Study, a large, representative, national survey that has been ongoing 
for more than two decades. Outcomes are chosen to provide a broad perspective of 
the individual and societal impacts of the interventions and include: heart 
disease, stroke, cancer, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, 
disability-free life expectancy, and medical costs. Eligibility for increased 
aspirin use in simulations is based on the 2011-2012 questionnaire on preventive 
aspirin use of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. These data 
reveal a large unmet need for daily aspirin, with over 40% of men and 10% of 
women aged 50 to 79 presenting high cardiovascular risk but not taking aspirin. 
We estimate that increased use by high-risk older Americans would improve 
national life expectancy at age 50 by 0.28 years (95% CI 0.08-0.50) and would 
add 900,000 people (95% CI 300,000-1,400,000) to the American population by 
2036. After valuing the quality-adjusted life-years appropriately, Americans 
could expect $692 billion (95% CI 345-975) in net health benefits over that 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: Expanded use of aspirin by older Americans with elevated risk of 
cardiovascular disease could generate substantial population health benefits 
over the next twenty years and do so very cost-effectively.

Month of Life of Long-Lived Seabird?

Telomeres are nucleotide sequences located at the ends of chromosomes that 
promote genome stability. Changes in telomere length (dynamics) are related to 
fitness or life expectancy, and telomere dynamics during the development phase 
are likely to be affected by growth and stress factors. Here, we examined 
telomere dynamics of black-tailed gull chicks (Larus crassirostris) in nests 
with and without siblings. We found that the initial telomere lengths of 
singletons at hatching were longer than those of siblings, indicating that 
singletons are higher-quality chicks than siblings in terms of telomere length. 
Other factors likely affecting individual quality (i.e., sex, laying date, 
laying order of eggs, and clutch size) were not related to telomere lengths. 
Within broods, initial telomere lengths were longer in older chicks than in 
younger chicks, suggesting that maternal effects, which vary with laying 
sequence, influence the initial lengths. Additionally, telomeres of chicks with 
a sibling showed more attrition between hatching and fledging than those of 
singleton chicks, suggesting that being raised with siblings can cause a 
sustained competitive environment that leads to telomere loss. High growth rates 
were associated with a low degree of telomere shortening observed in older 
siblings, perhaps because slower growth reflects higher food stress and/or 
higher aerobic metabolism from increased begging effort. Our results show that 
developmental telomere attrition was an inevitable consequence in two-chick 
nests in the pre- and post-hatching microenvironments due to the combination of 
social stress within the nest and maternal effects. The results of our study 
shed light on telomere dynamics in early life, which may represent an important
