cognitive health late in life. Policy planning and future research should be 
balanced across primary (policies reducing risk and increasing cognitive 
reserve), secondary (early detection and screening), and tertiary (once dementia 
is present) prevention. Each has their place, but upstream primary prevention 
has the largest effect on reduction of later dementia occurrence and disability.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces mortality and heart 
failure hospitalizations in patients with mild heart failure.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding CRT to an implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (CRT-D) compared with implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) alone among patients with left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction, prolonged intraventricular conduction, and mild heart 
failure.
DESIGN: Markov decision model.
DATA SOURCES: Clinical trials, clinical registries, claims data from Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
life tables.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients aged 65 years or older with a left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% or less, QRS duration of 120 milliseconds or 
more, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I or II symptoms.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: CRT-D or ICD alone.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Use of CRT-D increased life expectancy (9.8 years 
versus 8.8 years), QALYs (8.6 years versus 7.6 years), and costs ($286 500 
versus $228 600), yielding a cost per QALY gained of $61 700.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The cost-effectiveness of CRT-D was most 
dependent on the degree of mortality reduction: When the risk ratio for death 
was 0.95, the ICER increased to $119 600 per QALY. More expensive CRT-D devices, 
shorter CRT-D battery life, and older age also made the cost-effectiveness of 
CRT-D less favorable.
LIMITATIONS: The estimated mortality reduction for CRT-D was largely based on a 
single trial. Data on patients with NYHA class I symptoms were limited. The 
cost-effectiveness of CRT-D in patients with NYHA class I symptoms remains 
uncertain.
CONCLUSION: In patients with an LVEF of 30% or less, QRS duration of 120 
milliseconds or more, and NYHA class II symptoms, CRT-D appears to be 
economically attractive relative to ICD alone when a reduction in mortality is 
expected.

OBJECTIVE: Traditional burden-of-disease estimates often exclude personality 
disorders, which are associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The 
aim of this study was to estimate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
annual population-level quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses associated with 
different mental and physical health conditions. In particular, it sought to 
quantify the impact of personality disorders on quality of life, at an 
individual and population level.
METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of data from the National Epidemiologic 
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative survey of 
the US general population collected from 2001 to 2005 (N = 34,653). 
Health-related quality of life (measured using the Short-Form Health Survey-6D) 
was the main outcome of interest. Regression analysis assessed the impact of 
various mental (based on DSM-IV criteria) and physical health conditions on 
HRQoL scores, and this impact was combined with the prevalence of disorders to 
estimate the population-level burden of disease.
RESULTS: Mood disorders were associated with the highest decrease in HRQoL 
scores, followed by strokes, psychotic illness, and arthritis (P < .01). The 
greatest annual population QALY losses were caused by arthritis, mood disorders, 
and personality disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Quality-adjusted life year losses associated with personality 
disorders ranked behind only mood disorders and arthritis. Personality disorders 
were associated with significant reductions in quality of life, despite the fact 
that they are often excluded from traditional burden of disease estimates.

During the period of 1980-2000, the US obtained substantial reductions in air 
pollution and improvements in life expectancy (LE). Multiple factors contributed 
to improved health. This report explores and illustrates trade-offs between 
income, air pollution, and LE. Both improved air quality and income growth 
contributed to LE gains - without evidence of substantial negative tradeoffs 
between air pollution and income. Cleaner air may be considered an "economic 
good" with contributions to health, wellbeing, and human capital.

Sex Differences in Frailty.

Hubbard RE(1).

of Queensland, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Brisbane, Qld., 
Australia.

Although women live longer lives than men, they tend to have poorer health 
status. Here, we review the biological and socio-behavioral factors that may 
contribute to this sex-frailty paradox. The conceptual framework that frailty is 
a product of the environment and the recovery rate provides a new understanding 
of women's frailty burden. Even developed countries may present an environment 
more adverse for women, and lifestyle factors may increase women's vulnerability 
to stochastic subcellular events that increase recovery time. The frailty index 
does not reach the theoretical maximal value of 1; its limit is lower in men 
(0.61) compared to women (0.69). Perhaps deterministic characteristics omitted 
in current deficit counts, such as reduced emotional adaptability, are more 
prevalent in men. Alternatively, different limits may result from quantitative 
evolutionary design, such as a fitness-frailty pleiotropy in men or 
fertility-frailty pleiotropy in women. The engineering principle of safety 
factors (maximal capacity divided by routine functioning) may also be 
informative. If the human system has the same safety factor as its organs 
(approximately 2.5), men may be 'calibrated' around a frailty index of 0.244, 
compared to 0.276 for women. Because 0.25 represents the tipping point between 
functional independence and reliance on others, evolutionary design may have 
allowed for some limited dependence in women, perhaps motivated by the perinatal 
period.

For a study with an event time as the endpoint, its survival function contains 
all the information regarding the temporal, stochastic profile of this outcome 
variable. The survival probability at a specific time point, say t, however, 
does not transparently capture the temporal profile of this endpoint up to t. An 
alternative is to use the restricted mean survival time (RMST) at time t to 
summarize the profile. The RMST is the mean survival time of all subjects in the 
study population followed up to t, and is simply the area under the survival 
curve up to t. The advantages of using such a quantification over the survival 
rate have been discussed in the setting of a fixed-time analysis. In this 
article, we generalize this approach by considering a curve based on the RMST 
over time as an alternative summary to the survival function. Inference, for 
instance, based on simultaneous confidence bands for a single RMST curve and 
also the difference between two RMST curves are proposed. The latter is 
informative for evaluating two groups under an equivalence or noninferiority 
setting, and quantifies the difference of two groups in a time scale. The 
proposal is illustrated with the data from two clinical trials, one from 
oncology and the other from cardiology.

[PLUTONIUM AND LIFETIME REDUCTION AMONG PROFESSIONAL WORKERS FSUE].

[Article in Russian]

Tel'nov VI.

The objective of the study is the assessment of lifetime in the cohort of Mayak 
PA workers employed in 1948-1958 and exposed to incorporated Pu-239. The 
decrease of age at death 5.2 years among males and 6.6 years among females, and 
after the start of work--6.9 years among males and 7.7 years among females, with 
the increase of Pu-239 incorporation was shown. The association of the raised 
mortality rate from tumour causes is shown both among males and females, mainly 
due to malignant neoplasms of lung and live; which are organs of Pu-239 main 
deposition. For the first time related to Pu-239 incorporation decrease of age 
at death from tumour and non-tumour causes of main and secondary organs of 
deposition both among males and females was revealed. To assess the reduction of 
lifetime Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) were calculated per 10(5) 
person-years of potential life based on European gender standard. The 
calculations based on the obtained estimations showed significant dependence of 
YPLL on the level of Pu-239 incorporation. At that the main contribution to the 
increase of YPLL, i.e. to lifetime reduction, was due to radiation-induced 
decrease of the age at death as compared to radiation-induced increase of 
mortality rates.

A New Wave of Vaccines for Non-Communicable Diseases: What Are the Regulatory 
Challenges?

Darrow JJ, Kesselheim AS.

Erratum in
    Food Drug Law J. 2015;70(4):iii.

Vaccines represent one of the greatest achievements of medicine, dramatically 
reducing the incidence of serious or life-threatening infectious diseases and 
allowing people to live longer, healthier lives. As life expectancy has 
increased, however, the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as 
cancer, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes has increased. This shifting 
burden of disease has heightened the already urgent need for therapies that 
treat or prevent NCDs, a need that is now being met with increased efforts to 
develop NCD vaccines. Like traditional vaccines, NCD vaccines work by modulating 
the human immune system, but target cells, proteins or other molecules that are 
associated with the NCD in question rather than pathogens or pathogen-infected 
cells. Efforts are underway to develop NCD vaccines to address not only cancer 
and hypertension, but also addiction, obesity, asthma, arthritis, psoriasis, 
multiple sclerosis, and Crohn's disease, among others. NCD vaccines present an 
interesting challenge for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is 
tasked with approving new treatments on the basis of efficacy and safety. Should 
NCD vaccines be evaluated under the same analytic frame as traditional vaccines, 
or that of biologic drugs? Despite the borrowed nomenclature, NCD vaccines 
differ in important ways from infectious disease vaccines. Because infectious 
disease vaccines are generally administered to healthy individuals, often 
children, tolerance for adverse events is low and willingness to pay is limited. 
It is important to have infectious disease vaccines even for rare or eradicated 
disease (e.g., smallpox), in the event of an outbreak. The efficacy of 
infectious disease vaccines is generally high, and the vaccines convey 
population level benefits associated with herd immunity and potential 
eradication. The combination of substantial population-level benefits, low 
willingness to pay, and low tolerance for adverse events explains the need for 
the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, which encourages 
production and uptake by providing immunity from liability to industry and 
compensation to injured patients. These characteristics and considerations 
contrast sharply with those of NCD vaccines, raising the question of whether the 
term "vaccine" is appropriate for this new category of drugs. The article 
explores the emerging class of NCD vaccines, explains how they differ from 
traditional vaccines, and describes some regulatory implications of this 
innovative type of therapeutic.

Medical advances in the last decades have increased the average life expectancy, 
but also the incidence and prevalence of age-associated neurodegenerative 
diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative 
diseases and the most prevalent type of dementia. A plethora of different 
mechanisms contribute to AD, among which oxidative stress plays a key role in 
its development and progression. So far, there are no pharmacological treatments 
available and the current medications are mainly symptomatic. In the last years, 
dietary polyphenols have gained research attention due to their interesting 
biological activities, and more specifically their antioxidant properties. (-)- 
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a natural flavanol that has been 
extensively studied regarding its potential effects in AD. In this review we 
present the current in vitro and in vivo experimentation regarding the use of 
EGCG in AD. We also review the complex mechanisms of action of EGCG, not only 
limited to its antioxidant activity, which may explain its beneficial health 
effects.

OBJECTIVES: The risk of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) is traditionally assessed with a liver biopsy, which is both costly and 
associated with adverse events.
METHODS: We sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of four different 
strategies to assess fibrosis risk in patients with NAFLD: vibration controlled 
transient elastography (VCTE), the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), combination 
testing with NFS and VCTE, and liver biopsy (usual care). We developed a 
probabilistic decision analytical microsimulation state-transition model wherein 
we simulated a cohort of 10,000 50-year-old Americans with NAFLD undergoing 
evaluation by a gastroenterologist. VCTE performance was obtained from a 
prospective cohort of 144 patients with NAFLD.
RESULTS: Both the NFS alone and the NFS/VCTE strategies were cost effective at 
$5,795 and $5,768 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY), respectively. In the 
microsimulation, the NFS alone and NFS/VCTE strategies were the most 
cost-effective (dominant) in 66.8 and 33.2% of samples given a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. In a sensitivity analysis, 
the minimum cost per liver biopsy at which the NFS is cost saving is $339 and 
the maximum cost per VCTE exam at which the NFS/VCTE strategy remains cost 
saving is $1,593. The expected value of further research on this topic is $526 
million.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive risk stratification with both the NFS alone and the 
NFS/VCTE are cost-effective strategies for the evaluation and management of 
patients with NAFLD presenting to a gastroenterologist. Further research is 
needed to better define the natural history of NAFLD and the effect of novel 
treatments on decision making.

BACKGROUND: Rotavirus diarrhea is one of the most important vaccine-preventable 
causes of severe diarrhea in children worldwide. There are two live-attenuated 
virus vaccines licensed, Rotarix (RV1) a monovalent vaccine by GlaxoSmithKline 
and a pentavalent vaccine, RotaTeq(RV5), by Merck & Co., with similar results. 
This study aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the utilization of RV1 
compared with RV5 in Argentina.
METHODS: A deterministic Markov model based on the lifetime follow up of a 
static cohort was used. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as a measure of 
results, the perspective of the health care system and a 5% discount rate for 
health benefits and costs has been used. A review of the literature to obtain 
epidemiologic and resources utilization of rotavirus diarrhea was performed. The 
sources used to estimate epidemiologic parameters were the National Health 
Surveillance System, the national mortality statistics and national database of 
hospital discharges records. Costs were obtained from different health 
subsectors and are expressed in local currency.
RESULTS: Both vaccination alternatives were less costly and more effective than 
the strategy without vaccination (total costs $ 69,700,645 and 2575 total QALYs 
lost). When comparing RV1 vs. RV5, RV1 was less expensive ($ 60,174,508 vs. $ 
67,545,991 total costs) and more effective (1105 vs. 1213 total QALYs lost) than 
RV5, RV1 being therefore a dominating strategy. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed results to be robust with a 100% probability of being 
cost-effective at a WTP threshold of 1 GDP per capita when comparing the RV1 vs. 
no vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Both RV1 and RV5 schedules dominate the no vaccination strategy and 
RV5 was dominated by RV1. This information is a valuable input regarding the 
incorporation of this kind of vaccines into the national vaccination programs.

Does Introducing Imprecision around Probabilities for Benefit and Harm Influence 
the Way People Value Treatments?

BACKGROUND: Imprecision in estimates of benefits and harms around treatment 
choices is rarely described to patients. Variation in sampling error between 
treatment alternatives (e.g., treatments have similar average risks, but one 
treatment has a larger confidence interval) can result in patients failing to 
choose the option that is best for them. The aim of this study is to use a 
discrete choice experiment to describe how 2 methods for conveying imprecision 
in risk influence people's treatment decisions.
METHODS: We randomized a representative sample of the Canadian general 
population to 1 of 3 surveys that sought choices between hypothetical treatments 
for rheumatoid arthritis based on different levels of 7 attributes: route and 
frequency of administration, chance of benefit, serious and minor side effects 
and life expectancy, and imprecision in benefit and side-effect estimates. The 
surveys differed in the way imprecision was described: 1) no imprecision, 2) 
quantitative description based on a range with a visual graphic, and 3) 
qualitative description simply describing the confidence in the evidence.
RESULTS: The analyzed data were from 2663 respondents. Results suggested that 
more people understood imprecision when it was described qualitatively (88%) 
versus quantitatively (68%). Respondents who appeared to understand imprecision 
descriptions placed high value on increased precision regarding the actual 
benefits and harms of treatment, equivalent to the value placed on the 
information about the probability of serious side effects. Both qualitative and 
quantitative methods led to small but significant increases in decision 
uncertainty for choosing any treatment. Limitations included some issues in 
defining understanding of imprecision and the use of an internet survey of panel 
members.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insight into how conveying imprecision 
information influences patient treatment choices.

CONTEXT: Most patients with neuro-urological disorders require life-long medical 
care. The European Association of Urology (EAU) regularly updates guidelines for 
the diagnosis and treatment of these patients.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a summary of the 2015 updated EAU Guidelines on 
Neuro-Urology.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Structured literature searches in several databases were 
carried out to update the 2014 guidelines. Levels of evidence and grades of 
recommendation were assigned where possible.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Neurological disorders often cause urinary tract, sexual, 
and bowel dysfunction. Most neuro-urological patients need life-long care for 
optimal life expectancy and quality of life. Timely diagnosis and treatment are 
essential to prevent upper and lower urinary tract deterioration. Clinical 
assessment should be comprehensive and usually includes a urodynamic 
investigation. The neuro-urological management must be tailored to the needs of 
the individual patient and may require a multidisciplinary approach. Sexuality 
and fertility issues should not be ignored. Numerous conservative and 
noninvasive possibilities of management are available and should be considered 
before a surgical approach is chosen. Neuro-urological patients require 
life-long follow-up and particular attention has to be paid to this aspect of 
management.
CONCLUSIONS: The current EAU Guidelines on Neuro-Urology provide an up-to-date 
overview of the available evidence for adequate diagnosis, treatment, and 
follow-up of neuro-urological patients.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Patients with a neurological disorder often suffer from urinary 
tract, sexual, and bowel dysfunction and life-long care is usually necessary. 
The update of the EAU Guidelines on Neuro-Urology, summarized in this paper, 
enables caregivers to provide optimal support to neuro-urological patients. 
Conservative, noninvasive, or minimally invasive approaches are often possible.

PURPOSE: Regorafenib is a standard-care option for treatment-refractory 
metastatic colorectal cancer that increases median overall survival by 6 weeks 
compared with placebo. Given this small incremental clinical benefit, we 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib in the third-line setting for 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer from the US payer perspective.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost and effectiveness of 
regorafenib with those of placebo in the third-line treatment of metastatic 
colorectal cancer. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on Medicare 
reimbursement rates in 2014. Model robustness was addressed in univariable and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Regorafenib provided an additional 0.04 QALYs (0.13 life-years) at a 
cost of $40,000, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$900,000 per QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for regorafenib was 
> $550,000 per QALY in all of our univariable and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: Regorafenib provides minimal incremental benefit at high incremental 
cost per QALY in the third-line management of metastatic colorectal cancer. The 
cost-effectiveness of regorafenib could be improved by the use of value-based 
pricing.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cancelled and missed colonoscopy appointments waste 
resources, increase colonoscopy delays, and can adversely affect patient 
outcomes. We examined individual and organizational factors associated with 
missed and cancelled colonoscopy appointments in Veteran Health Administration 
facilities.
METHODS: From 69 facilities meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 27,994 
patients with colonoscopy appointments scheduled for follow-up, on the basis of 
positive fecal occult blood test results, between August 16, 2009 and September 
30, 2011. We identified factors associated with colonoscopy appointment status 
(completed, cancelled, or missed) by using hierarchical multinomial regression. 
Individual factors examined included age, race, sex, marital status, residence, 
drive time to nearest specialty care facility, limited life expectancy, 
comorbidities, colonoscopy in the past decade, referring facility type, referral 
month, and appointment lead time. Organizational factors included facility 
region, complexity, appointment reminders, scheduling, and prep education 
practices.
RESULTS: Missed appointments were associated with limited life expectancy (odds 
ratio [OR], 2.74; P = .0004), no personal history of polyps (OR, 2.74; P < 
.0001), high facility complexity (OR, 2.69; P = .007), dual diagnosis of 
psychiatric disorders and substance abuse (OR, 1.82; P < .0001), and opt-out 
scheduling (OR, 1.57; P = .02). Cancelled appointments were associated with age 
(OR, 1.61; P = .0005 for 85 years or older and OR, 1.44; P < .0001 for 65-84 
years old), no history of polyps (OR, 1.51; P < .0001), and opt-out scheduling 
(OR, 1.26; P = .04). Additional predictors of both outcomes included race, 
marital status, and lead time.
CONCLUSIONS: Several factors within Veterans Health Administration clinic 
control can be targeted to reduce missed and cancelled colonoscopy appointments. 
Specifically, developing systems to minimize referrals for patients with limited 
life expectancy could reduce missed appointments, and use of opt-in scheduling 
and reductions in appointment lead time could improve both outcomes.

Cost Effectiveness Analysis of Knee Osteoarthritis Treatment.

Stan G, Orban H, Orban C.

INTRODUCTION: Resource allocation is challenging in times of economic restraint 
and cannot be based only on clinical judgments, but must also take into account 
economic aspects. A method for assessing patient outcome is to estimate the 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). These will quantify the benefit gained by a 
certain treatment by measuring the change in health-related quality of life with 
time. This study will assess the cost effectiveness of conservative management, 
consisting in rehabilitation program, and compare the cost effectiveness of 
total knee arthroplasty when implanted to a non operated arthritic knee with 
cost effectiveness of the same procedure following high tibial osteotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study reviewed 30 patients who were treated for knee 
osteoarthritis with rehabilitation care (group 1-G1), 30 patients who underwent 
unilateral TKA to an non-operated knee (group 2-G2) and 30 patients who 
underwent TKA following HTO for degenerative arthritis of the knee (group 3-G3). 
The economical endpoint were the total direct costs (Euro), based on DRG rates 
for procedures. The cost effectiveness analysis was assessed by the ratio 
between direct costs as assessed by the economical endpoint and the associated 
patient benefit as assessed by the clinical endpoint (EUR/QALY).
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences was found between G2 and G3 
regarding clinical or radiological outcomes of this study. Yet the patients who 
did not previously suffered a HTO procedure showed lower mean values of KSS, ROM 
and femurotibial angle. A significant benefit is observed for G2 and G3 towards 
G1 patients. Neither a clinically relevant nor a statistically significant 
association between groups is observed in G2 and G3 (median benefit estimates 
2.5 versus 2.6 QALYs). Median benefit estimate for patients who did not 
previously suffered a HTO procedure was though smaller then benefit for those 
who did. A median cost effectiveness ratio of 1800 EUR/QALY (450 - 2000 EUR / 
QALY) was found based on the EuroQuol scores for G1; 1268 EUR/QALY (720 - 2160 
EUR/QALY), for G2, and 1975 EUR/QALY (720 - 2160 EUR/QALY) for G3.
DISCUSSION: Regarding surgical treatment, the results showed a statistically 
significant better cost benefit relation for patients from G2 (p 0,001). 
Conservative management for knee OA is neither clinically effective for pain or 
disease progression nor cost effective, when applied for late stages of OA.
CONCLUSION: We report the lowest cost per QALY in the literature for TKA. If 
financial constraints is a cause for rationalizing the medical services, careful 
patient selection to optimise the clinical and economical aspects of procedures 
may help to improve further the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.

Hematochezia due to Caecal Angiodysplazia led to Diagnosis of a Transverse Colon 
Cancer in a Young Female Patient: Case Report and Literature Review.

Andrei GN, Popa B, Popiel M, Diaconescu BI, Martian BV, Beuran M.

We present an unusual case of a caecal angiodysplasia whose bleeding determined 
the discovery of a mid-transverse colon cancer in a 26 years old female patient. 
After the initial successful angiographic treatment of the caecal lesion the 
patient underwent laparoscopic - assisted transverse colectomy. The 
postoperative evolution was favorable, without resumption of bleeding episodes 
and rapid social reintegration. The histopathology revealed mucinous 
adenocarcinoma that penetrates the visceral serous with 7 lymph nodes invasion 
of 18 examined. As a result of the advanced stage, pT4aN2bM0 - stage IIIC, the 
life expectancy at 5 years is between 30 to 50%.

Microbeam radiation treatment (MRT) using synchrotron radiation has shown great 
promise in the treatment of brain tumors, with a demonstrated ability to 
eradicate the tumor while sparing normal tissue in small animal models. With the 
goal of expediting the advancement of MRT research beyond the limited number of 
synchrotron facilities in the world, we recently developed a compact 
laboratory-scale microbeam irradiator using carbon nanotube (CNT) field 
emission-based X-ray source array technology. The focus of this study is to 
evaluate the effects of the microbeam radiation generated by this compact 
irradiator in terms of tumor control and normal tissue damage in a mouse brain 
tumor model. Mice with U87MG human glioblastoma were treated with sham 
irradiation, low-dose MRT, high-dose MRT or 10 Gy broad-beam radiation treatment 
(BRT). The microbeams were 280 μm wide and spaced at 900 μm center-to-center 
with peak dose at either 48 Gy (low-dose MRT) or 72 Gy (high-dose MRT). Survival 
studies showed that the mice treated with both MRT protocols had a significantly 
extended life span compared to the untreated control group (31.4 and 48.5% of 
life extension for low- and high-dose MRT, respectively) and had similar 
survival to the BRT group. Immunostaining on MRT mice demonstrated much higher 
DNA damage and apoptosis level in tumor tissue compared to the normal brain 
tissue. Apoptosis in normal tissue was significantly lower in the low-dose MRT 
group compared to that in the BRT group at 48 h postirradiation. Interestingly, 
there was a significantly higher level of cell proliferation in the MRT-treated 
normal tissue compared to that in the BRT-treated mice, indicating rapid normal 
tissue repairing process after MRT. Microbeam radiation exposure on normal brain 
tissue causes little apoptosis and no macrophage infiltration at 30 days after 
exposure. This study is the first biological assessment on MRT effects using the 
compact CNT-based irradiator. It provides an alternative technology that can 
enable widespread MRT research on mechanistic studies using a preclinical model, 
as well as further translational research towards clinical applications.

Short-term inpatient psychotherapy based on transactional analysis (STIP-TA) in 
patients with personality disorders (PD) has shown to be more effective than 
comparable other specialized psychotherapies (OP). The aim of this study was to 
assess whether the higher effectiveness of STIP-TA also results in a better 
cost-effectiveness. Patients treated with STIP-TA were matched with patients 
treated with OP by the propensity score. Healthcare costs and lost productivity 
costs were measured over 3 years and from the societal perspective. 
Cost-effectiveness was represented by costs per quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Uncertainty was assessed using bootstrapping. Mean 3-year costs were 
€59,834 for STIP-TA and €69,337 for OP, a difference of -€9,503, 95% CI 
[-32,561, 15,726]. QALYs were 2.29 for STIP-TA and 2.05 for OP, a difference of 
.24, 95% CI [.05, .44]. STIP-TA is a dominant treatment compared to OP: less 
costly and more effective. We conclude that STIP-TA is a cost-effective 
treatment in PD patients.

Workers from the Sellafield nuclear facility (Cumbria, UK) with occupational 
exposures to external sources of ionizing radiation were examined for 
translocation frequencies in peripheral blood lymphocytes using fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH). This is an extension of an earlier study of retired 
workers, and includes analyses of additional samples from the earlier 
collection, bringing the total to 321. Another 164 samples from both current and 
retired employees, including 26 repeat samples, were obtained from a new 
collection, thus giving a combined dataset of 459 workers. This all-male 
population of workers was divided into 6 dose groups comprising 97 with recorded 
external occupational doses <50 mGy, 118 with 50-249 mGy, 129 with 250-499 mGy, 
89 with 500-749 mGy, 17 with 750-999 mGy and 9 with >1,000 mGy. Univariate 
analysis showed a significant association between external dose and 
translocation frequency (P < 0.001) with the estimate of slope ± standard error 
being 1.174 ± 0.164 × 10(-2) translocations per Gy. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that age increased the rate of translocations by 0.0229 ± 0.0052 × 
10(-2) per year (P < 0.001). However, the impact of age adjustment on the 
radiation dose response for translocation frequencies was minor with the new 
estimate of slope ± standard error being 1.163 ± 0.162 × 10(-2) translocations 
per Gy. With the dose response for the induction of translocations by chronic in 
vivo low-LET radiation now well characterized, cytogenetic analysis can play an 
integral role in retrospective dose reconstruction of chronic exposure in 
epidemiological studies of exposed populations.

It has long been known that life span is inversely related to resting heart rate 
in most organisms. This association between heart rate and survival has been 
attributed to the metabolic rate, which is greater in smaller animals and is 
directly associated with heart rate. Studies have shown that heart rate is 
related to survival in apparently healthy individuals and in patients with 
different underlying cardiovascular diseases. A decrease in heart rate due to 
therapeutic interventions may result in an increase in survival. However, there 
are many factors regulating heart rate, and it is quite plausible that these may 
independently affect life expectancy. Nonetheless, a fast heart rate itself 
affects the cardiovascular system in multiple ways (it increases ventricular 
work, myocardial oxygen consumption, endothelial stress, aortic/arterial 
stiffness, decreases myocardial oxygen supply, other) which, in turn, may affect 
survival. In this brief review, the effects of heart rate on the heart, arterial 
system and survival will be discussed.

The advances of modern medicine did not only result in prolongation of life 
expectancy, but also led to a shift from dying at home to dying in public 
institutions. In western countries most people die at advanced age in medical 
facilities. Hence, the question regarding the conditions, which should be 
provided by society and especially medicine, to allow terminally ill people to 
experience "good dying" is substantial. For this purpose, an examination of 
patients', family members' and health care providers' understanding of the term 
" good dying" is required. The present paper aims at shedding light on the term 
"good dying" and to summarize the current state of research. Therefore, the 
attributes of "good dying" will be described from the perspectives of patients, 
family members and health care providers, which are discussed and examined in 
current medical-sociological research. These attributes can be illustrated on 
three dimensions: Quality of life at the end of life (e. g. pain relief, mental 
well-being), quality of dying (e. g. avoiding prolonged dying, autonomy, 
presence of relatives) and quality of health care at the end of life (e. g. 
patient-oriented health care, positive communication between health care 
providers and patients, availability of guidelines). Although the attributes of 
"good dying" are described in detail in the existing literature, further studies 
have to clarify the relevance and impact of these attributes as predictors of 
"good dying".

This article provides an update for 2015 on the burden of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), with a particular focus on coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, 
across the countries of Europe. Cardiovascular disease is still the most common 
cause of death within Europe, causing almost two times as many deaths as cancer 
across the continent. Although there is clear evidence, where data are 
available, that mortality from CHD and stroke has decreased substantially over 
the last 5-10 years, there are still large inequalities found between European 
countries, in both current rates of death and the rate at which these decreases 
have occurred. Similarly, rates of treatment, particularly surgical 
intervention, differ widely between those countries for which data are 
available, indicating a range of inequalities between them. This is also the 
first time in the series that we use the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP) 
to calculate age-standardized death rates (ASDRs). This new standard results in 
ASDRs around two times as large as the 1976 ESP for CVD conditions such as CHD 
but changes little the relative rankings of countries according to ASDR.
