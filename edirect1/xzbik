patients >65 presenting with initial episodes of symptomatic cholelithiasis that 
did not require initial hospitalization or cholecystectomy. Probabilities for 
subsequent hospitalization, emergency cholecystectomy, and perioperative 
complications were based on previously published probabilities from a 5 % 
national sample of Medicare patients. Costs were estimated from Medicare 
reimbursements and from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Utilities 
(quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were obtained from established literature 
estimates. Elective cholecystectomy compared to observation in all patients was 
associated with lower effectiveness (-0.10 QALYs) and had an increased cost of 
$3,422.83 per patient at 2-year follow-up. Elective cholecystectomy became the 
more effective option when the likelihood for continued symptoms exceeded 
45.3 %. Elective cholecystectomy was both more effective and less costly when 
the probability for continued symptoms exceeded 82.7 %. An individualized shared 
decision-making strategy based on these data can increase elective 
cholecystectomy rates in patients at high risk for recurrent symptoms and 
minimize unnecessary cholecystectomy for patients unlikely to benefit.

Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of using two evidence-synthesis paradigms, 
pairwise meta-analysis (PMA) vs. network meta-analysis (NMA), on the expected 
value of information (EVI) outcomes, using pharmacotherapy of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease as a case study.
METHODS: Bayesian random-effects PMAs were performed for each pharmacotherapy 
vs. placebo, and a Bayesian random-effects NMA was performed combining both 
placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials. Both provided comparative rate ratio 
(RR) estimates between each pharmacotherapy vs. placebo. A Markov model was 
developed to project costs and quality-adjusted life-years of five commonly used 
treatments for chronic obsructive pulmonary disorder. RRs for the treatment 
effect compared with placebo derived using PMA and NMA were used alongside 
values from the literature to populate the model. In addition to standard 
cost-effectiveness outputs, we calculated and compared the expected value of 
perfect information (EVPI) and the expected value of partial perfect information 
(EVPPI) for treatment effects, for comparisons that included all or a subset of 
treatments.
RESULTS: The network of evidence included five different treatments, compared in 
19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which in total included 28,172 
individuals. The cost-effectiveness outcomes were similar between the two 
evidence-synthesis paradigms. The individual EVPI for all treatments was 
Can$1,262 for PMA-based analyses and Can$572 for NMA-based analyses. For all 
comparisons involving two, three, or four treatments, the comparison with the 
highest EVPI was different between the two methods. Similarly, the choice of PMA 
or NMA had resulted in substantially different EVPPI rankings.
CONCLUSION: Our case study shows that the choice of PMA or NMA can have 
significant effects on the EVI results. Under comparable conditions, the 
incorporation of more evidence in the NMA most likely increases the precision of 
estimates and therefore is likely to result in lower EVI outcomes. As our study 
demonstrates, the difference in EVI outcomes can be substantial, potentially 
affecting the decision to conduct research and the design of future research.

University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, 1200 Herman Pressler 
Drive, Houston, TX, 77030, USA, David.R.Lairson@uth.tmc.edu.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy prolongs survival for stage III colon cancer patients 
but community-level evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of 
treatment for elderly patients is limited. Comparisons were between patients 
receiving no chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and FOLFOX 
(5-FU + oxaliplatin).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Surveillance 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Patients 
(≥65 years) with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III colon cancer at 
diagnosis in 2004-2009 were identified. The 3-way propensity score matched 
sample included 3,534 patients. Effectiveness was measured in life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Medicare costs (2010 US dollars) were 
estimated from diagnosis until death or end of study.
RESULTS: FOLFOX patients experienced 6.06 median life-years and 4.73 QALYs. 
Patients on 5-FU had 5.75 median life-years and 4.50 median QALYs, compared to 
3.42 and 2.51, respectively, for the no chemotherapy patients. Average total 
healthcare costs ranged from US$85,422 for no chemotherapy to US$168,628 for 
FOLFOX. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for 5-FU versus no 
chemotherapy were US$17,131 per life-year gained and US$20,058 per QALY gained. 
ICERs for FOLFOX versus 5-FU were US$139,646 per life-year gained and US$188,218 
per QALY gained. Results appear to be sensitive to age, suggesting that FOLFOX 
performs better for patients 65-69 and 80+ years old while 5-FU appears most 
effective and cost effective for the age groups 70-74 and 75-79 years.
CONCLUSION: FOLFOX appears more effective and cost effective than other 
strategies for colon cancer treatment of older patients. Results were sensitive 
to age, with ICERs exhibiting a U-shaped pattern.

Pharmacy, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.

BACKGROUND: Although the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) healthcare sector 
has been expanding rapidly, many differences exist across socioeconomic status, 
clinical practice standards and healthcare systems.
OBJECTIVE: Predict production functions of health by measuring socioeconomic and 
expenditure factors that impact life expectancy in the EMR.
METHODS: Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory 
and the World Bank were used for this cross-sectional, time-series study 
spanning 21 nations in the EMR from 1995 to 2010. The primary outcome was life 
expectancy at birth. Covariates of interest included sociodemographic and health 
indicators. To both establish and validate appropriate categorization of 
countries, a cluster analysis was undertaken to group cases by taking selected 
characteristics into account. A variance-component, multilevel mixed-effects 
linear model was employed that incorporated a finite, Almon, distributed lag of 
5 years and bootstrapping with 5000 simulations to model the production function 
of life expectancy.
RESULTS: Results of the cluster analysis found four groupings. Clusters 1 and 2, 
composed of six total countries, generally represented non-industrialized/least 
developed countries. Clusters 3 and 4, totalling 15 nations, captured more 
industrialized nations. Overall, gross domestic product (GDP) (P = 0.011), 
vaccination averages (P = 0.026) and urbanization (P = 0.026), were significant 
positive predictors of life expectancy. No significant predictors existed for 
Cluster 1 countries. Among Cluster 2 nations, physician density (P = 0.014) and 
vaccination averages (P = 0.044) were significant positive predictors. GDP (P = 
0.037) and literacy (P = 0.014) were positive significant predictors among 
Cluster 3 nations. GDP (P = 0.002), health expenditures (P = 0.002) and 
vaccination averages (P = 0.014) were positive significant predictors in Cluster 
4 countries.
CONCLUSION: Predictors of life expectancy differed between non-industrialized 
and industrialized nations, with the exception of vaccination averages. 
Non-industrialized/least developed nations were associated with adjusted life 
expectancies of >14% lower than their industrialized peers. Continued work to 
address differences in the quality of and access to care in the EMR is required.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are probably the most common hematologic 
malignancies in adults over the age of 60 and are a major source of morbidity 
and mortality among older age groups. Diagnosis and management of this chronic 
blood cancer has evolved significantly in recent years and there are Food and 
Drug Administration-approved therapies that can extend patients' life expectancy 
and improve quality of life. Primary care physicians (PCPs) are often involved 
in the process of diagnosis and follow-up of MDS patients, especially those in 
low-risk groups. They can therefore play an important role in improving patient 
care and quality of life by ensuring early referral and participating in 
supportive management. There is also a shortage of oncologists which increases 
the importance of the role of PCPs in management of MDS patients. In the face of 
limited resources, PCPs can improve access and quality of care in MDS patients. 
This article provides an overview of the common manifestations, diagnostic 
approaches, and therapeutic modalities of MDS for PCPs, with a focus on when to 
suspect MDS, when a referral is appropriate, and how to provide appropriate 
supportive care for patients diagnosed with MDS.

Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan; and ‡Department of Statistical Science, School 
of Advanced Sciences, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Tokyo, 
Japan.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of population-based national hospital 
discharge data collected for the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the trends and in-hospital outcomes of patients with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection undergoing spinal fusion on a national 
level.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Highly active antiretroviral therapy has provided 
healthier lives and prolonged the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. 
However, few previous studies have reported trends and outcomes of HIV-positive 
patients undergoing spinal surgery.
METHODS: Clinical data were derived from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample 
between 2000 and 2009. Patients who underwent spinal fusion were identified. 
Data regarding HIV, patient- and health care system-related characteristics, 
comorbidities, in-hospital complications, and mortality were retrieved and 
analyzed. In-hospital outcomes were compared between HIV-positive and -negative 
patients and analyzed with the use of multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 5,070 HIV-positive patients underwent spinal fusion in the 
United States during the last decade. From 2000 to 2009, population-adjusted 
incidence of HIV-positive patients who underwent spinal fusion has increased 
more than 3-fold (0.094 per 100,000 in 2000 to 0.303 per 100,000 in 2009; P < 
0.001). Comparison between HIV-positive and -negative patients showed that 
HIV-positive patients had a significantly higher respiratory complication rate 
(6.2% vs. 3.2%), wound-related complication rate (2.7% vs. 1.7%), overall 
in-hospital complication rate (12.2% vs. 9.5%), and in-hospital mortality rate 
(1.6% vs. 0.3%), as well as longer hospital stay (6.6 d vs. 4.2 d). The risk of 
in-hospital mortality was 3.53 times higher in HIV-positive patients after 
controlling for other factors (95% confidence interval, 2.02-6.14; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: During the last decade, the incidence of HIV-positive patients 
undergoing spinal fusion has increased in the United States. In this study, HIV 
infection was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in patients 
undergoing spinal fusion.

BACKGROUND: In Italy, basic health needs of patients with inherited bleeding 
disorders are met by a network of 50 haemophilia centres belonging to the 
Italian Association of Haemophilia Centres. Further emerging needs, due to the 
increased life expectancy of this patient group, require a multi-professional 
clinical management of the disease and provide a challenge to the organisation 
of centres.In order to achieve harmonised quality standards of haemophilia care 
across Italian Regions, an institutional accreditation model for haemophilia 
centres has been developed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: To develop an accreditation scheme for haemophilia 
centres, a panel of experts representing medical and patient bodies, the 
Ministry of Health and Regional Health Authorities has been appointed by the 
National Blood Centre. Following a public consultation, a technical proposal in 
the form of recommendations for Regional Health Authorities has been formally 
submitted to the Ministry of Health and has formed the basis for a proposal of 
Agreement between the Government and the Regions.
RESULTS: The institutional accreditation model for Haemophilia Centres was 
approved as an Agreement between the Government and the Regions in March 2013. 
It identified 23 organisational requirements for haemophilia centres covering 
different areas and activities.
DISCUSSION: The Italian institutional accreditation model aims to achieve 
harmonised quality standards across Regions and to implement continuous 
improvement efforts, certified by regional inspection systems. The identified 
requirements are considered as necessary and appropriate in order to provide 
haemophilia services as "basic healthcare levels" under the umbrella of the 
National Health Service. This model provides Regions with a flexible 
institutional accreditation scheme that can be potentially extended to other 
rare diseases.

BACKGROUND: In Italy, the project on the social burden and quality of life (QoL) 
of patients with haemophilia investigates costs from a society perspective and 
provides an overview of their quality of life. Moreover, as life expectancy 
increased in recent years along with new treatment strategies implemented in the 
last decades, it analyses trends of costs other than drugs simulating impacts 
during patient whole life.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We ran a web-based cross-sectional survey supported by the 
Italian Federation of Haemophilia Societies in recruiting patients with 
haemophilia and their caregivers. We developed a questionnaire to collect 
information on demographic characteristics, healthcare and social services 
consumption, formal and informal care utilisation, productivity loss and quality 
of life. In particular, quality of life was assessed through the EuroQoL tool. 
Last, we applied the illness cost method from a society perspective.
RESULTS: On average, quality of life is worse in adult patients compared to 
child and caregivers: more than 75% of adult patients declare physical problems, 
43% of adult patients and 54% of their parents have anxiety problems. Assuming a 
society perspective, the estimated mean annual total cost per patient in 2012 is 
117,732 €. Drugs represent 92% of total costs. Focusing on costs other than 
drugs, each additional point of EuroQoL tool implies a costs' reduction of 279 
€. The impact of age varies across age groups: each added year implies a total 
decrease of costs up to 46.6 years old. Afterwards, every additional year 
increases costs.
DISCUSSION: Quality of life of patients with haemophilia and their caregivers 
improved and it influences positively on consumed resources and on their 
contribution to the social-economic system. Costs other than drugs for patients 
with haemophilia follow the same trends of general population.

INTRODUCTION: Due to the increase in life expectancy, patients with haemophilia 
and other inherited bleeding disorders are experiencing age-related 
comorbidities that present new challenges. In order to meet current and emerging 
needs, a model for healthcare pathways was developed through a project funded by 
the Italian Ministry of Health. The project aimed to prevent or reduce the 
social-health burden of the disease and its complications.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The National Blood Centre appointed a panel of experts 
comprising clinicians, patients, National and Regional Health Authority 
representatives. Following an analysis of the scientific and regulatory 
references, the panel drafted a technical proposal containing recommendations 
for Regional Health Authorities, which has been formally submitted to the 
Ministry of Health. Finally, a set of indicators to monitor haemophilia care 
provision has been defined.
RESULTS: In the technical document, the panel of experts proposed the adoption 
of health policy recommendations summarised in areas, such as: multidisciplinary 
integrated approach for optimal healthcare provision; networking and protocols 
for emergency care; home therapy; registries/databases; replacement therapy 
supply and distribution; recruitment and training of experts in bleeding 
disorders. The recommendations became the content of proposal of agreement 
between the Government and the Regions. Monitoring and evaluation of haemophilia 
care through the set of established indicators was partially performed due to 
limited available data.
CONCLUSIONS: The project provided recommendations for the clinical and 
organisational management of patient with haemophilia. A particular concern was 
given to those areas that play a critical role in the comorbidities and 
complications prevention. Recommendations are expected to harmonise healthcare 
care delivery across regional networks and building the foundation for the 
national haemophilia network.

Monitoring pharmacotherapy response, safety, and tolerability to enhance 
adherence in bipolar disorder.

Neuroscience, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.

Among patients with bipolar disorder, treatment nonadherence can be triggered by 
lack of response or by medication-induced adverse effects. To track treatment 
response, clinicians can have patients complete daily life and mood charts to 
provide accurate information over time on patients' mood, adherence, side 
effects, and life events. Rating scales like the CGI-BP are also an option for 
assessing treatment response. In addition, clinicians should monitor patients 
for common side effects related to bipolar depression treatments, such as 
sedation and weight gain/metabolic abnormalities, which lead to increased 
medical problems and shortened life expectancy. By implementing specific 
interventions to address these effects, clinicians can help promote optimal 
outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder.

Gastrocnemius and soleus are selectively activated when adding knee extensor 
activity to plantar flexion.

The gastrocnemius is a biarticular muscle that acts not only as a plantar 
flexor, but also as a knee flexor, meaning that it is an antagonist during knee 
extension. In contrast, the soleus is a monoarticular plantar flexor. Based on 
this anatomical difference, these muscles' activities should be selectively 
activated during simultaneous plantar flexion and knee extension, which occur 
during many activities of daily living. This study examined the selective 
activation of gastrocnemius and soleus activities when voluntary isometric 
activation of knee extensors was added to voluntary isometric plantar flexion. 
Ten male volunteers performed isometric plantar flexion at 10%, 20%, and 30% of 
maximum effort. During each plantar flexion task, isometric knee extension was 
added at 0%, 50%, and 100% of maximum effort. When knee extension was added, the 
average rectified value of the electromyographic activity of the medial 
gastrocnemius was significantly depressed (P=.002), whereas that of the soleus 
was significantly increased (P<.001) regardless of the plantar flexion level. 
These results suggest that plantar flexion with concurrent knee extensor 
activity leads to selective activation of the soleus and depression of the 
synergistic activity of the gastrocnemius.

The most common preventative measure against mumps is vaccination with mumps 
vaccine. In most parts of the world, mumps vaccine is routinely delivered 
through live attenuated Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine. In Japan, receiving 
mumps vaccine is voluntary and vaccine uptake rate is less than 30%. The 
introduction of mumps vaccine into routine vaccination schedule has become one 
of the current topics in health policy and has raised the need to evaluate 
efficient ways in protecting children from mumps-related diseases in Japan. We 
conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov model and calculated 
incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 11 different programmes; a 
single-dose programme at 12-16 months and 10 two-dose programmes with second 
dose uptakes at ages 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Our base-case analyse 
set the cost per shot at ¥6951 (US$72; 1US$=96.8). Results show that single-dose 
programme dominates status quo. On the other hand, ICERs of all 10 two-dose 
programmes are under ¥6,300,000 (US$65,082) per QALY from payer's perspective 
while it ranged from cost-saving to <¥7,000,000 (US$72,314) per QALY from 
societal perspective. By adopting WHO's classification that an intervention is 
cost-effective if ICER (in QALY) is between one and three times of GDP as a 
criterion, either of the vaccination programme is concluded as cost-effective 
from payer's or societal perspectives. Likewise, to uptake second dose at 3-5 
years old is more favourable than an uptake at any other age because of lower 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reducing the burden of stroke is a priority for the 
Veterans Affairs Health System, reflected by the creation of the Veterans 
Affairs Stroke Quality Enhancement Research Initiative. To inform the 
initiative's strategic planning, we estimated the relative population-level 
impact and efficiency of distinct approaches to improving stroke care in the US 
Veteran population to inform policy and practice.
METHODS: A System Dynamics stroke model of the Veteran population was 
constructed to evaluate the relative impact of 15 intervention scenarios 
including both broad and targeted primary and secondary prevention and acute 
care/rehabilitation on cumulative (20 years) outcomes including quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained, strokes prevented, stroke fatalities prevented, and 
the number-needed-to-treat per QALY gained.
RESULTS: At the population level, a broad hypertension control effort yielded 
the largest increase in QALYs (35,517), followed by targeted prevention 
addressing hypertension and anticoagulation among Veterans with prior 
cardiovascular disease (27,856) and hypertension control among diabetics 
(23,100). Adjusting QALYs gained by the number of Veterans needed to treat, 
thrombolytic therapy with tissue-type plasminogen activator was most efficient, 
needing 3.1 Veterans to be treated per QALY gained. This was followed by 
rehabilitation (3.9) and targeted prevention addressing hypertension and 
anticoagulation among those with prior cardiovascular disease (5.1). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the ranking of interventions was 
robust to uncertainty in input parameter values.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention strategies tend to have larger population impacts, 
though interventions targeting specific high-risk groups tend to be more 
efficient in terms of number-needed-to-treat per QALY gained.

Preterm birth, low birthweight, intrauterine growth retardation and small for 
gestational age are birth phenotypes that significantly contribute to life-long 
morbidity and mortality. This review examines the epidemiologic and biologic 
evidence of folic acid (FA) as a potential population-based intervention to 
curtail some adverse birth phenotypic expressions, and by extension, their later 
physical and neurodevelopmental consequences. We outlined a feto-placental 
adaptation categorization taking into account how prenatal insults may be 
encoded in fetal development, the adaptive success of the feto-placental 
response, and subsequent expression in the health of the fetus. Although there 
are plausible biological pathways that can be implicated, we found that the 
epidemiological evidence on the role of perinatal FA nutriture and fetal 
programming of adverse birth phenotypes is still inconclusive. Because biologic 
and epidemiological considerations alone do not suffice in deciphering the 
utility of FA in averting adverse birth phenotypes, we proposed a 
biopsychosocial model that takes into account multi-layered psychosocial 
contexts for improving subsequent research studies in this area.

PURPOSE: The economic situation showed that the resources devoted to health 
spending are limited, making rationalisation of their consumption necessary. The 
relevance of pharmacoeconomic analyses is becoming crucial. The ECO Foundation, 
promoting the quality of oncology care, set out to analyse the consensus on the 
new therapeutic targets inclusion and the integration of pharmacoeconomics when 
evaluating their effectiveness.
METHODS: Study about pharmacoeconomic estimations was performed during the first 
ECO-Seminar (2010). It was developed using a modified Delphi method, in four 
stages: (1) committee coordinator establishment, (2) expert-panel selection, (3) 
preparation and submission of survey (1 question) by email, and (4) analysis of 
the degree of consensus reached.
RESULTS: Results were obtained from surveys completed by 35 experts. Regarding 
the tolerable annual cost for the approval of new drugs, 68.8 % of the 
respondents considered a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained 
between €30,000 and 100,000 acceptable (34.4 % €30,000-60,000; 34.4 % 
€60,000-100,000), 21.9 % of the respondents found costs between 
€100,000-150,000/QALY and 9.3 % of the respondents found costs above 
€150,000/QALY acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: The costs of new drugs are higher than traditional treatments, 
making it a priority to identify subgroups of patients with specific molecular 
profiles as candidates for higher-efficiency-targeted therapies. The allocation 
of the available resources to the most effective interventions, to achieve the 
best clinical outcomes with lower costs and best subjective profile possible, 
allows expenditure to be rationalised. Pharmacoeconomic studies are a basic tool 
for obtaining better health outcomes according to the available resources, while 
also considering the other needs of the population.

Smoking is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Discontinuing 
smoking can increase life expectancy to the presmoking level. Unaided attempts 
are often ineffective, strengthening the necessity of cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (CBT), nicotine replacement or pharmacotherapy. Still, relapse rates are 
high. Recently, a modulation of nicotine craving, which predicts relapse, 
through transcranial magnetic stimulation to the prefrontal cortex was shown. In 
a pilot study, we investigated whether 4 sessions of intermittent theta burst 
stimulation (iTBS) as add-on treatment to CBT reduces nicotine craving and 
improves long-term abstinence (at 3, 6 and 12 months). Smokers were randomly 
assigned to a treatment (n = 38) or a sham group (n = 36). Although we did not 
find reduced craving, we could show higher abstinence rates in the treatment 
group at 3 months. At 6 and 12 months abstinence rates did not differ 
significantly. Results at 12 months, however, have to be interpreted cautiously 
due to significant differences in the dropout rates between the two groups at 
this time point. We provide first evidence for a beneficial effect of additional 
iTBS on intermediate nicotine abstinence; however, the low number of iTBS 
sessions might have prevented longer effects. More lasting effects might be 
achieved by iTBS maintenance sessions in analogy to the treatment of depression.

With the increased life expectancy for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) has 
come chronic HIV-related impairments, many of which can be successfully treated 
by physical therapy (PT). The purpose of this study is to determine common 
HIV-related impairments that merit PT, HIV providers' PT referral patterns and 
patients' barriers to care. 57 surveys were distributed to HIV providers in 
Atlanta, Georgia. Results showed that providers typically referred to PT for 
musculoskeletal conditions, neurological conditions and pain control. Financial 
issues and lack of insurance were the most common barriers to PT care. This 
study concluded that there is a need for PT services amongst PLWHA and that 
financial limitations are a significant treatment barrier for PLWHA.

BACKGROUND: Hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms) are common 
menopausal symptoms, often causing distress, sleep deprivation and reduced 
quality of life. Although hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment, 
there are concerns about serious adverse events. Non-hormonal pharmacological 
therapies are less effective and can also cause adverse effects. Complementary 
therapies, including acupuncture, are commonly used for menopausal vasomotor 
symptoms. While the evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating 
vasomotor symptoms is inconclusive, acupuncture has a low risk of adverse 
effects, and two small studies suggest it may be more effective than 
non-insertive sham acupuncture. Our objective is to assess the efficacy of 
needle acupuncture in improving hot flush severity and frequency in menopausal 
women. Our current study design is informed by methods tested in a pilot study.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a stratified, parallel, randomised sham-controlled trial 
with equal allocation of participants to two trial groups. We are recruiting 360 
menopausal women experiencing a minimum average of seven moderate hot flushes a 
day over a seven-day period and who meet diagnostic criteria for the Traditional 
Chinese Medicine diagnosis of Kidney Yin deficiency. Exclusion criteria include 
breast cancer, surgical menopause, and current hormone replacement therapy use. 
Eligible women are randomised to receive either true needle acupuncture or sham 
acupuncture with non-insertive (blunt) needles for ten treatments over eight 
weeks. Participants are blinded to treatment allocation. Interventions are 
provided by Chinese medicine acupuncturists who have received specific training 
on trial procedures. The primary outcome measure is hot flush score, assessed 
using the validated Hot Flush Diary. Secondary outcome measures include 
health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms, credibility of 
the sham treatment, expectancy and beliefs about acupuncture, and adverse 
events. Participants will be analysed in the groups in which they were 
randomised using an intention-to-treat analysis strategy.
DISCUSSION: Results from this trial will significantly add to the current body 
of evidence on the role of acupuncture for vasomotor symptoms. If found to be 
effective and safe, acupuncture will be a valuable additional treatment option 
for women who experience menopausal vasomotor symptoms.

Neurological diseases have placed heavy social and financial burdens on modern 
society. As the life expectancy of humans is extended, neurological diseases, 
such as Parkinson's disease, have become increasingly common among senior 
populations. Although the enigmas of Parkinson's diseases await resolution, more 
vivid pictures on the cause, progression, and control of the illness are 
emerging after years of research. On the molecular level, GTPases are implicated 
in the etiology of Parkinson's disease and are rational pharmaceutical targets 
for their control. However, targeting individual GTPases, which belong to a 
superfamily of proteins containing multiple members with a conserved guanine 
nucleotide binding domain, has proven to be challenging. In contrast, 
pharmaceutical pursuit of inhibition of kinases, which constitute another 
superfamily of proteins with more than 500 members, has been fairly successful. 
We reviewed the breakthroughs in the history of kinase drug discovery to provide 
guidance for the GTPase field. We summarize recent progress made in the 
regulation of GTPase activity. We also present an efficient and cost effective 
approach to drug screening, which uses multiplex flow cytometry and 
mixture-based positional scanning libraries. These methods allow simultaneous 
measurements of both the activity and the selectivity of the screened library. 
Several GTPase activator clusters were identified which showed selectivity 
against different GTPase subfamilies. While the clusters need to be further 
deconvoluted to identify individual active compounds, the method described here 
and the structure information gathered create a foundation for further 
developments to build upon.

University , Shanghai, China .

Salmonella is the most common cause of bacterial food poisoning in humans 
worldwide. Thus, rapid and reliable methods for the detection of this pathogen 
are required. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(rt-RT-PCR), which detects the presence of mRNA (shorter half-life than DNA) has 
shown great potential for detecting viable pathogens. We recently identified a 
few new potential specific DNA sequences for Salmonella enterica using a 
comparative genomics method (Chen et al., 2010). In the present study, we 
examined the expression of the Salmonella-specific sigDE operon (encoding 
invasion proteins within the pathogenicity island 5) under typical growth 
conditions to determine whether sigDE could be a useful viability marker for the 
bacterium. We then assayed sigDE mRNA from cells heat-treated at 60°C, 100°C, 
and 121°C (autoclaved), and found that mRNA was degraded in autoclaved bacterial 
samples. These results showed that the sigDE transcript is a suitable mRNA 
target for rt-RT-PCR with samples pretreated at 121°C. Thus, an rt-RT-PCR using 
sigDE primers was developed for the detection of viable Salmonella. An RNA 
internal amplification control was constructed by overlap extension PCR, 
synthesized using in vitro transcription with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, and 
incorporated into the rt-RT-PCR system to eliminate false-negative results. The 
rt-RT-PCR system has the capability of specifically detecting all the tested S. 
enterica serovars, and the detection limit of this assay with cultures of 
Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 13311 was 10(1) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. After 
18-h enrichment, sigDE-based rt-RT-PCR could detect as low as 10(0) CFU/mL of 
Salmonella from egg broth and milk.

Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA.

BACKGROUND: The obesity rate among the elderly long-term care (LTC) residents in 
the United States is increasing rapidly. However, there is a paucity of research 
investigating the burden of obesity on LTC and Medicaid financing. The purpose 
of this study is to fill the knowledge gap by estimating the burden of 
overweight and obesity on LTC and Medicaid financing.
METHODS: Using nationally representative Cost and Use Files of Medicare Current 
Beneficiary Survey from 1997 to 2005, we used 2-part model and cohort-based 
simulation to evaluate the effect of overweight and obesity on LTC days and 
Medicaid expenditures across the lifespan among the current elderly population. 
Combining the per capita estimates with 2010 census, we project future aggregate 
burden of obesity on LTC demand and Medicaid cost among baby boomers.
RESULTS: Obesity and related chronic diseases lead to higher probability to 
enter LTC facility in a younger age, more LTC days before death, and higher 
lifetime LTC cost reimbursed by Medicaid. However, such effect is only 
statistically significant among women, not significant among men. At the 
population level, we project that overweight and obesity will induce 1.3 billion 
or more LTC patient days and $68 billion or more Medicaid costs (in 2012 value) 
among baby boomers.
CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity among the elderly will bring tremendous 
burden to LTC providers and Medicaid. Policy makers should keep the burden of 
obesity on LTC in mind when planning LTC and Medicaid policy reform.

Decision making is complex and difficult in clinical practice. Clinicians are 
often faced with a large range of possible alternative decision options, each 
with their own consequences and trade-offs. Health economics methods enable 
informed decision making on how best to allocate limited resources that could 
lead to most health gains. Economic evaluation in particular is highly relevant 
in transplantation medicine. Transplantation is an expensive intervention, but 
it improves the quality of life and survival of people with chronic diseases. 
The balance between health care resource use and the optimal health gains is 
useful not only to decision-makers, but also to consumers, clinicians, and 
researchers. This article is an overview of the concepts of economic evaluation 
in the setting of transplantation and highlights the applicability of these 
concepts in clinical transplantation.
