RESULTS: Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of FLV in people > 50 years old ranged 
from 0.9% (Guatemala, Mexico, and Uruguay) to 2.2% (Brazil and Cuba) and 
increased by age. The weighted average prevalence for the 10 national surveys 
was 1.6%: 1.4% in men and 1.8% in women. For all 10 national studies, a total of 
509 164 people > 50 years old were estimated to have FLV. Based on the 910 
individuals affected, the main causes of FLV were age-related macular 
degeneration (weighted average prevalence of 26%), glaucoma (23%), diabetic 
retinopathy (19%), other posterior segment disease (15%), non-trachomatous 
corneal opacities (7%), and complications after cataract surgery (4%).
CONCLUSIONS: FLV is expected to rise because of 1) the exponential increase of 
this condition by age, 2) increased life expectancy, and 3) the increase in 
people > 50 years old. These data can be helpful in planning and developing low 
vision services for the region; large countries such as Brazil and Mexico would 
need more studies. Prevention is a major strategy to reduce FLV, as more than 
50% of it is preventable.

BACKGROUND: Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare, fatal demyelinating 
disorder with limited treatment options. Published outcomes after hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are scant and mixed. We report survival and 
function following HSCT for a large, single-center MLD cohort.
METHODS: Transplant-related data, survival and serial measures (brain MRI, nerve 
conduction velocity (NCV), neurologic and neuropsychology evaluations) were 
reviewed. When possible, parental interviews informed current neurologic status, 
quality-of-life, and adaptive functioning. Gross motor and expressive functions 
for late-infantile (LI-MLD) and juvenile (J-MLD) patients were described using 
previously reported, MLD-specific scales.
RESULTS: Forty patients with confirmed MLD have undergone HSCT at our center. 
Twenty-one (53 %) survive at a median 12 years post-HSCT. Most deaths (n = 17) 
were treatment-related; two died from disease progression. Survival did not 
depend upon MLD subtype or symptom status at transplant. LI-MLD patients survive 
beyond reported life expectancy in untreated disease. Abnormal brain MRI and 
peripheral nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were common before HSCT. Following 
transplant, fewer patients experienced MRI progression compared to NCV 
deterioration. Sixteen LI-MLD and J-MLD survivors were evaluable for long-term 
gross motor and/or expressive language functioning using existing MLD clinical 
scoring systems. While most J-MLD patients regressed, the aggregate cohort 
demonstrated superior retention of function compared to published natural 
history. Seventeen LI-MLD, J-MLD and adult subtype (A-MLD) survivors were 
evaluable for long-term adaptive functioning, activities of daily living, and/or 
cognition. Relative cognitive sparing was observed despite overall global 
decline. Five sibling pairs (one LI-MLD and four J-MLD), in which at least one 
underwent transplant in our cohort, were evaluable. Within each familial dyad, 
survival or function was superior for the treated sibling, or if both siblings 
were transplanted, for the pre-symptomatic sibling.
CONCLUSIONS: HSCT is a viable treatment option for MLD, but has significant 
limitations. Later-onset phenotypes may benefit most from early, pre-symptomatic 
transplant. Until superior, novel treatment strategies are demonstrated, MLD 
patients should be carefully considered for HSCT.

Economic evaluations of interventions to manage hyperphosphataemia in adult 
haemodialysis patients: A systematic review.

Managing hyperphosphataemia in haemodialysis patients is resource-intensive. A 
search for cost-effective interventions in this field is needed to inform 
decisions on the allocation of healthcare resources. NHSEED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and 
CINAHL were searched for full economic evaluations of 
hyperphosphataemia-managing interventions in adult haemodialysis patients, 
published between 2004 and 2014, in English, French, Dutch or German. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the interventions were up-rated to 
2013US$ using Purchasing Power Parity conversion rates and Consumer Price 
Indices. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Extended 
Consensus on Health Economic Criteria List. Twelve out of the 1681 retrieved 
records fulfilled the inclusion criteria. They reported only on one aspect of 
hyperphosphataemia management, which is the use of phosphate binders 
(calcium-based and calcium-free, in first-line and sequential use). No economic 
evaluations of other phosphorus-lowering interventions were found. The included 
articles derived from five countries and most of them were funded by 
pharmaceutical companies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of phosphate 
binders ranged between US$11 461 and US$157 760 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained. Calcium-based binders (especially calcium acetate) appear to be the 
optimal cost-effective first- and second-line therapy in prevalent patients, 
while the calcium-free binder, lanthanum carbonate, might provide good value for 
money, as second-line therapy, in incident patients. The studies' overall 
quality was suboptimal. Drawing firm conclusions was not possible due to the 
quality heterogeneity and inconsistent results. Future high-quality economic 
evaluations are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to address 
other interventions to manage hyperphosphataemia in this population.

Slowed ageing, welfare, and population problems.

Africa. christopher.wareham@wits.ac.za.

Biological studies have demonstrated that it is possible to slow the ageing 
process and extend lifespan in a wide variety of organisms, perhaps including 
humans. Making use of the findings of these studies, this article examines two 
problems concerning the effect of life extension on population size and welfare. 
The first--the problem of overpopulation--is that as a result of life extension 
too many people will co-exist at the same time, resulting in decreases in 
average welfare. The second--the problem of underpopulation--is that life 
extension will result in too few people existing across time, resulting in 
decreases in total welfare. I argue that overpopulation is highly unlikely to 
result from technologies that slow ageing. Moreover, I claim that the problem of 
underpopulation relies on claims about life extension that are false in the case 
of life extension by slowed ageing. The upshot of these arguments is that the 
population problems discussed provide scant reason to oppose life extension by 
slowed ageing.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the lifetime outcomes and economic implications of 
combinatorial pharmacogenomic (CPGx) testing versus treatment as usual (TAU) 
psychopharmacologic medication selection for a representative major depressive 
disorder patient who has not responded to previous treatment(s).
STUDY DESIGN: Markov state-transition analysis based on clinical studies.
METHODS: Clinical validity and utility were based on published findings in 
prospective clinical studies of a commercially available CPGx test. Data for 
quality of life, direct costs, and indirect costs were extracted from 
meta-analyses of published literature on clinical studies and claims databases. 
Outcomes were assessed from a societal perspective, and included differences 
between the CPGx and the TAU strategies in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
cumulative direct and indirect costs, and cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: CPGx improved the treatment response rate by 70% (1.7 times as high as 
that with TAU), increasing QALYs by 0.316 years. With these health benefits, 
CPGx is expected to save $3711 in direct medical costs per patient and $2553 in 
work productivity costs per patient over the lifetime. The cost-effectiveness of 
CPGx testing was robust over a wide range of variation in the input parameters, 
including the scenario when testing efficacy was set to its lower limit.
CONCLUSIONS: CPGx testing has been shown by prospective studies to modify 
treatment decisions for patients nonresponsive to previous treatment(s), with 
increased rates of treatment response. These effects are projected to increase 
quality-adjusted survival, and to save both direct and indirect costs to 
individual patients and society generally.

This study analyzed differences in healthy life expectancy in the elderly based 
on three health dimensions in Brazil from 1998 to 2008: disability-free life 
expectancy, healthy life expectancy based on self-rated health, and chronic 
disease-free life expectancy. The Sullivan method was used, combining life 
tables from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and 
interval estimates of the prevalence of functional disability, self-rated 
health, and chronic diseases according to the Brazilian National Household 
Sample Survey (PNAD, 1998 and 2008). Besides the increase in life expectancy, 
the study showed significant and similar increases in disability-free life 
expectancy and healthy life expectancy based on self-rated health at almost all 
ages. Women had higher life expectancies than men, but expected to live longer 
with poor health, regardless of the indicator used to measure health. Although 
the studies measured health differently (making comparisons difficult), women 
showed a consistent disadvantage in healthy life expectancy.

The current study estimated DALY (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator 
of burden of disease, for Brazil in 2008. The North and Northeast regions showed 
higher burden of disease. Chronic noncommunicable diseases predominated in all 
regions of the country, especially cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders 
(particularly depression), diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
The study also showed a high burden of homicides and traffic accidents. Brazil's 
epidemiological profile appears even more complex when one considers the 
non-negligible burden of communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal 
conditions, and nutritional deficiencies. The analyses allowed a more detailed 
understanding of the Brazilian's population's health status, underscoring the 
need for crosscutting actions beyond specific health sector policies and greater 
attention to the quality of information on morbidity and mortality.

Studying of the effects of low doses of γ-irradiation is a crucial issue in 
different areas of interest, from environmental safety and industrial monitoring 
to aerospace and medicine. The goal of this work is to identify changes of 
lifespan and expression stress-sensitive genes in Drosophila melanogaster, 
exposed to low doses of γ-irradiation (5-40 cGy) on the imaginal stage of 
development. Although some changes in life extensity in males were identified 
(the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5, 10 and 40 cGy) as well as in 
females (the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5 and 40 cGy), they were 
not caused by the organism "physiological" changes. This means that the observed 
changes in life expectancy are not related to the changes of organism 
physiological functions after the exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. 
The identified changes in gene expression are not dose-dependent, there is not 
any proportionality between dose and its impact on expression. These results 
reflect nonlinear effects of low dose radiation and sex-specific 
radio-resistance of the postmitotic cell state of Drosophila melanogaster imago.

[Analysis of characteristics of tinnitus in patients with auditory neuropathy 
spectrum disorder].

[Article in Chinese]

Wang H, Qi Y, Guan J, Lan L, Xie L, Yu L, Yin Z, Zong L, Wang D, Wang Q.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of tinnitus in patients with 
auditory neuropathy spec- trum disorder (ANSD).
METHOD: This study recruited 14 ANSD patients with tinnitus. All the ANSD 
patients un- derwent detailed history taking, audiological examinations and 
assessments of tinnitus. This study analyzed the correlation of tinnitus status 
and hearing loss, and discussed the effects of sex, age, and the course of 
disease on tinnitus in ANSD patients.
RESULT: (1) In the ANSD patients, tinnitus often occurred in 3 years after the 
onset of hearing loss; (2) Tinnitus was highly prevalent in ANSD patients, and 
the severity of tinnitus was mostly from mild to moderate; (3) There was no 
obvious correlation between the subjective grading of tinnitus and hearing loss 
de- gree, and the impact of curve patterns of hearing loss on the level of 
tinnitus need much more evidence-based proof; (4) Along with the course 
extension, the impact of tinnitus on the quality of life was much more obvious; 
(5) Some risk factors such as noise exposure could be the reasons of aggravating 
the degree of tinnitus.
CONCLUSION: Tinnitus in ANSD patients has its unique clinical features. The 
study of Tinnitus in ANSD patients can provide clinical basis for further 
research in ANSD.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of cancer survivors has doubled in the past four 
decades; however, death due to cardiovascular disease is more prevalent in 
survivors than the general population.
OBJECTIVE, DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated novel and traditional 
cardiometabolic risk factors in young male cancer survivors in a cross-sectional 
study of male cancer survivors aged 25-45 years compared with age-matched 
noncancer controls. Demographic and anthropometric data were recorded and 
biochemical and hormonal parameters assayed from fasting blood samples in 176 
survivors and 213 controls (lipids were measured in all survivors and 97 
controls).
RESULTS: Compared with controls, survivors had significantly higher body mass 
index, adipocytokines, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels and lower free androgen index (FAI). Handgrip strength, smoking, alcohol 
consumption, free oestrogen index, insulin-like growth factor 1 and high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not differ between cancer survivors and 
controls. Risk factors were analysed simultaneously using stepwise multivariable 
logistic regression, and this showed that high leptin: adiponectin ratio (odds 
ratio = 2·63; 95% confidence interval: 1·34-5·15; P = 0·005), 
hypercholesterolaemia (odds ratio = 1·85; 95%CI: 1·08-3·17; P = 0·025) and low 
FAI (odds ratio = 2·01; 95% confidence interval: 1·07-3·79; P = 0·030) were 
independently more common in survivors. The odds ratio in survivors for having 
at least two of these three risk factors rose to 6·58 (95% confidence interval: 
3·30-13·12; P < 0·001). Among survivors, risk factors were not different between 
cancer therapies but worse in survivors who had radiotherapy involving the 
testes (hyperleptinaemia and insulin resistance) or age at diagnosis above group 
median (hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia).
CONCLUSIONS: A high leptin: adiponectin ratio, hypercholesterolaemia and low FAI 
are observed in young male cancer survivors, especially those who received 
radiotherapy involving the testes or were diagnosed at a later age. In view of 
their youth and known increased risk of cardiovascular death, treatment 
strategies are required to address this cardiovascular risk.

BACKGROUND: Most studies of sex and race differences after acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) have not taken into account differences in life expectancy in 
the general population. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) is a metric that 
takes into account the burden of disease and can be compared by sex and race.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine sex and race differences in long-term 
survival after AMI using life expectancy and YPLL to account for differences in 
population-based life expectancy.
METHODS: Using data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a prospective 
cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for AMI between 1994 and 
1995 (N = 146,743), we calculated life expectancy and YPLL using Cox 
proportional hazards regression with extrapolation using exponential models.
RESULTS: Of the 146,743 patients with AMI, 48.1% were women and 6.4% were black; 
the average age was 75.9 years. Post-AMI life expectancy estimates were similar 
for men and women of the same race but lower for black patients than white 
patients. On average, women lost 10.5% (SE 0.3%) more of their expected life 
than men, and black patients lost 6.2% (SE 0.6%) more of their expected life 
than white patients. After adjustment, women still lost an average of 7.8% 
(0.3%) more of their expected life than men, but black race became associated 
with a survival advantage, suggesting that racial differences in YPLL were 
largely explained by differences in clinical presentation and treatment between 
black and white patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Women and black patients lost more years of life after AMI, on 
average, than men and white patients, an effect that was not explained in women 
by clinical or treatment differences.

Mental health starts with physical health: current status and future directions 
of non-pharmacological interventions to improve physical health in first-episode 
psychosis.

People with psychotic disorders have reduced life expectancy compared with the 
general population. This difference is primarily due to increased prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease associated with antipsychotic drugs and with modifiable 
risk factors, including weight gain, low exercise, poor diet, and high 
prevalence of cigarette smoking. We review non-pharmacological interventions for 
physical health behaviour in patients with chronic and first-episode psychosis. 
Our findings suggest that weight loss and attenuation of weight gain are 
achievable but limited and might not persist beyond the end of an intervention. 
Evidence for smoking cessation interventions is scarce. The case for early 
intervention to prevent deterioration of physical health is strong. We propose a 
framework for development of interventions, which addresses three main factors 
largely absent in previous research: (1) examination of aetiological factors 
related to poor physical health, (2) theory-driven interventions that target 
aetiological factors, and (3) assessment of feasibility.

National and global health policymakers require good information about the costs 
and benefits of their investments in measles and rubella immunization programs. 
Building on our review of the existing measles and rubella health economics 
literature, we develop inputs for use in regional and global models of the 
expected future benefits and costs of vaccination, treatment, surveillance, and 
other global coordination activities. Given diversity in the world and limited 
data, we characterize the costs for countries according to the 2013 World Bank 
income levels using 2013 U.S. dollars (2013$US). We estimate that routine 
immunization and supplemental immunization activities will cost governments and 
donors over 2013$US 2.3 billion per year for the foreseeable future, with 
high-income countries accounting for 55% of the costs, to vaccinate global birth 
cohorts of approximately 134 million surviving infants and to protect the global 
population of over 7 billion people. We find significantly higher costs and 
health consequences of measles or rubella disease than with vaccine use, with 
the expected disability-adjusted life year (DALY) loss for case of disease 
generally at least 100 times the loss per vaccine dose. To support estimates of 
the economic benefits of investments in measles and/or rubella elimination or 
control, we characterize the probabilities of various sequelae of measles and 
rubella infections and vaccine adverse events, the DALY inputs for health 
outcomes, and the associated treatment costs. Managing measles and rubella to 
achieve the existing and future regional measles and rubella goals and the 
objectives of the Global Vaccine Action Plan will require an ongoing commitment 
of financial resources that will prevent adverse health outcomes and save the 
associated treatment costs.

Sequence mismatches may induce nonspecific extension reaction, causing false 
results for SNP diagnostics. Herein, we systematically investigated the impact 
of various 3'-terminal mismatches on isothermal amplification catalyzed by 
representative DNA polymerases. Despite their diverse efficiencies depending on 
types of mismatch and kinds of DNA polymerase, all 12 kinds of single 
3'-terminal mismatches induced the extension reaction. Generally, only several 
mismatches (primer-template, C-C, G-A, A-G, and A-A) present an observable 
inhibitory effect on the amplification reaction, whereas other mismatches 
trigger amplified signals as high as those of Watson-Crick pairs. The related 
mechanism was deeply discussed, and a primer-design guideline for specific SNP 
analysis was summarized. Furthermore, we found that the addition of appropriate 
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can significantly inhibit mismatch extension and 
enhance the amplification specificity. Also the high-accuracy SNP analysis of 
human blood genomic DNA has been demonstrated by AuNPs-improved isothermal 
amplification, the result of which was verified by sequencing (the gold standard 
method for SNP assay). Collectively, this work provides mechanistic insight into 
mismatch behavior and achieves accurate SNP diagnostics, holding great potential 
for the application in molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine.

Early supplemented low-protein diet restriction for chronic kidney disease 
patients in Taiwan - A cost-effectiveness analysis.

You JH, Ming WK, Lin WA, Tarn YH.

BACKGROUND: Low-protein diet (LPD) together with supplementation with 
ketoanalogs (KA) is associated with slower decline of estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We compared potential 
clinical and economic outcomes of KA supplement initiation at eGFR 15 - 29 
mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 in CKD patients on LPD from the 
healthcare payer's perspective.
METHODS: Markov model was designed to simulate outcomes of adult patients with 
eGFR 15 - 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 on two strategies LPD with KA supplementation; 
watchfulwaiting on LPD alone and KA initiation when eGFR declined to < 15 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Medical cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
calculated over 10 years. Results The early-initiation group gained higher QALYs 
(3.926 QALYs vs. 3.787 QALYs) with lower cost (USD 564,637 vs. USD 914,236) (USD 
1 = NTD 30) when compared with the watchful-waiting group in base-case analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis indicated that early KA initiation at eGFR at 17 - 29 
mL/min/1.73 m2 would be the preferred cost-effective option, if relative 
reduction of eGFR decline associated with LPD plus KA was > 4%. 10,000 Monte 
Carlo simulations showed the early-initiation group to be less costly with 
higher QALYs gained than the watchful-waiting group by USD 343,665 (95% CI 
342,139 - 345,191) and 0.160 QALYs (95% CI 0.140 - 0.180), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Early KA supplementation with LPD in CKD patients appeared to be 
cost-saving and gained higher QALYs in Taiwan. Acceptance of early supplemented 
LPD as cost-effective depended upon the reduction of eGFR decline associated 
with KA plus LPD and eGFR level to initiate KA supplementation.

Nosiheptide is a member of the thiopeptide family of antibiotics which 
demonstrates potent activities against various bacterial pathogens. The 
formation of its C-terminal amide is catalysed by NosA in an unusual strategy 
for maturating certain thiopeptides by processing precursor peptides featuring a 
serine extension. Here, a recombinant C-terminally truncated 
selenomethionine-derivatized NosA1-111 variant from Streptomyces actuosus 
consisting of residues 1-111, named SeMet NosA1-111, was crystallized using the 
sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. Diffraction data were collected to 2.40 Å 
resolution using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belonged to the primitive 
cubic space group P4132, with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 143.3 Å. Assuming 
the presence of three molecules in the asymmetric unit, the calculated Matthews 
coefficient was 3.94 Å(3) Da(-1) and the corresponding solvent content was 
40.3%.

Successful combination therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has 
transformed this disease from a short-lived infection with high mortality to a 
chronic disease associated with increasing life expectancy. This is true for 
high- as well as low- and middle-income countries. As a result of this increased 
life expectancy, people living with HIV are now at risk of developing other 
chronic diseases associated with aging. Heart failure has been common among 
people living with HIV in the eras of pre- and post- availability of 
antiretroviral therapy; however, our current understanding of the pathogenesis 
and approaches to management have not been systematically addressed. HIV may 
cause heart failure through direct (e.g., viral replication, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, cardiac autoimmunity, autonomic dysfunction) and indirect (e.g., 
opportunistic infections, antiretroviral therapy, alcohol abuse, micronutrient 
deficiency, tobacco use) pathways. In low- and middle-income countries, 2 large 
observational studies have recently reported clinical characteristics and 
outcomes in these patients. HIV-associated heart failure remains a common 
cardiac diagnosis in people living with heart failure, yet a unifying set of 
diagnostic criteria is lacking. Treatment patterns for heart failure fall short 
of society guidelines. Although there may be promise in cardiac glycosides for 
treating heart failure in people living with HIV, clinical studies are needed to 
validate in vitro findings. Owing to the burden of HIV in low- and middle-income 
countries and the concurrent rise of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 
strategic and concerted efforts in this area are likely to impact the care of 
people living with HIV around the globe.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased life expectancy of 
HIV/AIDS patients, but the quality of life (QOL) still remains the same.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 356 people living with HIV (PLHIV) were 
interviewed to assess their QOL using WHOQOL-HIV BREF questionnaire. The 
association between QOL with sociodemographic, clinical and cohabitation status 
of the participants was tested using ANOVA and Student t-test, and p value < .05 
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Physical domain of QOL showed maximum score of 16.4, while a minimum 
score of 12.2 was seen in social relationship domain. Participants with higher 
socioeconomic status (SES) and self-motivated to take ART had shown better 
scores across all the domains of QOL ( p < .05).
CONCLUSION: In our study, quality of life was high among males, younger 
patients, married participants, higher socioeconomic status, longer duration of 
ART, self-motivation to take ART, absence of opportunistic infection, and with 
higher CD4 count.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, 5 randomized controlled trials demonstrated 
the benefit of endovascular therapy compared with intravenous tissue-type 
plasminogen activator in acute stroke. Economic evidence evaluating stent 
retrievers is limited. We compared the cost-effectiveness of intravenous 
tissue-type plasminogen activator alone versus mechanical thrombectomy and 
intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator as a bridging therapy in eligible 
patients in the UK National Health Service.
METHODS: A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed using a lifetime 
horizon. A Markov model was constructed and populated with probabilities, 
outcomes, and cost data from published sources, including 1-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Mechanical thrombectomy was more expensive than intravenous tissue-type 
plasminogen activator, but it improved quality-adjusted life expectancy. The 
incremental cost per (quality-adjusted life year) gained of mechanical 
thrombectomy over a 20 year period was $11 651 (£7061). The probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated that thrombectomy had a 100% probability of 
being cost-effective at the minimum willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted 
life year commonly used in United Kingdom.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the upfront costs of thrombectomy are high, the potential 
quality-adjusted life year gains mean this intervention is cost-effective. This 
is an important factor for consideration in deciding whether to commission this 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: In the UK, approval decisions by Health Technology Assessment bodies 
are made using a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold, the value 
of which is based on little empirical evidence. We test the feasibility of 
estimating the "true" value of the threshold in NHS Scotland using information 
on marginal services (those planned to receive significant (dis)investment). We 
also explore how the NHS makes spending decisions and the role of cost per QALY 
evidence in this process.
DATA AND METHODS: We identify marginal services using NHS Board-level responses 
to the 2012/13 Budget Scrutiny issued by the Scottish Government, supplemented 
with information on prioritisation processes derived from interviews with 
Finance Directors. We search the literature for cost-effectiveness evidence 
relating to marginal services.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness estimates of marginal services vary hugely and 
thus it was not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the threshold. This is 
unsurprising given the finding that cost-effectiveness evidence is rarely used 
to justify expenditure plans, which are driven by a range of other factors.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the differences in objectives 
between HTA bodies and local health service decision makers. We also demonstrate 
that, even if it were desirable, the use of cost-effectiveness evidence at local 
level would be highly challenging without extensive investment in health 
economics resources.

BACKGROUND: Hyperkyphosis negatively affects health status, physical mobility, 
and quality of life, but there is no standard protocol for treating people with 
hyperkyphosis. Treatment options include targeted exercise.
OBJECTIVES: This single-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) will determine 
the efficacy of a targeted multimodal spine-strengthening exercise program, 
compared with no exercise intervention, among community-dwelling men and women 
aged ≥60 years.
DESIGN: The RCT is a parallel-group design, with 1:1 randomization to exercise 
and attentional control groups.
SETTING: The study will be conducted at one primary site (one academic medical 
center partnered with one local community medical center).
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred men and women, aged ≥60 years, with thoracic kyphosis 
≥40 degrees will be randomized.
INTERVENTION: The targeted multimodal spine-strengthening exercise intervention 
includes exercise and postural training delivered by a physical therapist in a 
group of 10 participants, 3 times a week for 6 months. Controls receive monthly 
health education meetings in a group of 10 participants and monthly calls from 
the study coordinator to monitor physical activity and any adverse events.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome is change in Cobb angle of kyphosis measured 
from lateral spine radiographs at baseline and 6 months. Secondary outcomes 
include change in physical function (assessed with the modified Physical 
Performance Test, Timed "Up & Go" Test, timed loaded standing, 4-m walk, and 
Six-Minute Walk Test) and health-related quality of life (assessed with the 
modified Scoliosis Research Society instrument [SRS-30] self-image domain and 
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] global health 
and physical function indexes). Additional secondary outcomes include pain, 
physical activity level, spinal flexion and extension muscle strength, 
paraspinal extensor muscle density, and adverse events.
LIMITATIONS: Blinding of the participants and instructors providing the 
intervention is not possible.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of a high-quality, adequately powered exercise 
intervention in men and women with kyphosis ≥40 degrees will be evaluated to 
determine whether targeted multimodal spine-strengthening exercise reduces 
hyperkyphosis in older adults and improves important secondary outcomes of 
physical function and health-related quality of life.

An Up-to-15-Year Comparison of the Survival and Complication Burden of 
Three-Unit Tooth-Supported Fixed Dental Prostheses and Implant-Supported Single 
Crowns.

Walton TR.

PURPOSE: To assess and compare the outcomes and economic complication burden of 
three-unit tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses (TFDPs) and implant-supported 
single crowns (ISCs) provided to a sequential cohort in a specialist 
prosthodontic practice over a 15-year period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequential patients requiring replacement of a single 
missing tooth between 1996 and 2010 with a metal-ceramic three-unit TFDP (n = 
145 patients, n = 174 prostheses) or ISC (n = 174 patients, n = 220 prostheses) 
were included. Prostheses subjectively judged at insertion to have an 
unfavorable 10-year prognosis (17 TFDPs, 0 ISCs) were removed from statistical 
analyses. The estimated cumulative survival (ECS) was calculated with the life 
table actuarial method and standard errors calculated with the Greenwood 
formula. Differences in outcomes between all prostheses and those replacing only 
anterior or only posterior teeth were assessed with the log rank test. 
Complication incidence, severity, and economic burden, measured in time/cost 
accounting units (TAUs), were tallied and compared descriptively.
RESULTS: The 15-year ECS did not differ for 112 TFDPs (92.75% ± 3.28%) and 81 
ISCs (95.95% ± 2.92%) replacing posterior teeth. However, the 15-year ECS was 
significantly greater for 139 ISCs (93.33% ± 6.44%) than for 45 TFDPs (82.82% ± 
6.50%) replacing anterior teeth. The economic burden of nonterminal 
complications for both prostheses was low (mean = 0.3 and 0.2 TAUs per 
prosthesis for TFDPs and ISCs, respectively). This equated to 3 TAUs/100 years 
in clinical service and 4 TAUs/100 years in clinical service for the TFDPs and 
ISCs, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The survival of three-unit TFDPs and ISCs over 15 years was not 
statistically different when replacing posterior teeth, but ISCs survived 
significantly better when replacing anterior teeth. The complication rates of 
the TFDPs and ISCs were similar, but the economic burden for the TFDPs was 
greater.
