Primary dysmenorrhea (PD), or painful menstruation in the absence of identified 
uterine pathology, affects 5 to 9 in every 10 reproductive-aged women. Despite 
its high prevalence, just a few studies with very small patient numbers have 
focused on health-related quality of life impairment in PD. We aimed to assess 
health-related quality of life values for a severe and a mild hypothetical PD 
health state using 10-year time trade-off and willingness-to-pay methods. In 
2015, a nationwide convenience sample of women, aged between 18 and 40 years, 
was recruited using an Internet-based cross-sectional survey in Hungary. 
Respondents with a known history of secondary dysmenorrhea were excluded. Data 
on 1836 and 160 women, with and without a history of PD, respectively, were 
analysed. Mean utility values for the severe and mild health states were 0.85 
(median 0.95) and 0.94 (median 1), respectively. Participants were willing to 
pay a mean of &OV0556;1127 (median &OV0556;161) and &OV0556;142 (median 
&OV0556;16) for a complete cure from the severe and mild PD health states. 
Compared with the non-PD group, women with PD valued both health states worse 
according to willingness to pay (P < 0.05) but similar in the time trade-off. It 
seems that PD substantially contributes to the quality-adjusted life year loss 
in this age group, which is comparable with losses from chronic diseases such as 
type 1 diabetes, asthma, atopic eczema, or chronic migraine. Our findings 
provide a useful input to cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses of PD 
treatments.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco consumption contributes significantly to the global burden 
of disease. The prevalence of smoking is estimated to be increasing in many 
low-income countries, including Tanzania, especially among women and youth. Even 
so, the implementation of tobacco control measures has been discouraging in the 
country. Efforts to foster investment in tobacco control are hindered by lack of 
evidence on what works and at what cost.
AIMS: We aim to estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of population-based 
tobacco control strategies in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in 
Tanzania.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using an 
Excel-based Markov model, from a governmental perspective. We employed an 
ingredient approach and step-down methodologies in the costing exercise 
following a government perspective. Epidemiological data and efficacy inputs 
were derived from the literature. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
averted as the outcome measure. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried 
out with Ersatz to incorporate uncertainties in the model parameters.
RESULTS: Our model results showed that all five tobacco control strategies were 
very cost-effective since they fell below the ceiling ratio of one GDP per 
capita suggested by the WHO. Increase in tobacco taxes was the most 
cost-effective strategy, while a workplace smoking ban was the least 
cost-effective option, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$5 and US$267, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though all five interventions are deemed very cost-effective 
in the prevention of CVD in Tanzania, more research on budget impact analysis is 
required to further assess the government's ability to implement these 
interventions.

Why and how are we living longer?

What is the topic of this review? The reasons for the continuing increase in 
human life expectancy are examined in the light of progress in understanding the 
physiological basis of ageing. Prospects for further extending the health span - 
the period free of age-related disability and disease - are critically assessed. 
What advances does it highlight? No active programming directly causes ageing, 
which instead results as a side effect of how evolution optimises the 
physiological allocation of resources between growth, reproduction and 
maintenance. Under pressure of natural selection, there was insufficient 
priority in maintaining the body well enough that it could endure without 
progressive accumulation of multiple kinds of molecular and cellular damage. 
Understanding human ageing is a major challenge for the physiological sciences. 
It is made all the more urgent by the survival of inreasing numbers of people to 
advanced old age and by a shift in the underlying causes of the continuing 
increase in life expectancy. The previous increase was caused almost entirely by 
the prevention of deaths in the early and middle years of life; a process that 
has seen such success that in developed countries there remains little scope for 
significant further increase from this cause. The more recent increase is driven 
by something new. We are reaching old age in generally better health, and it is 
the death rates at advanced ages that are now falling fast. At the same time, 
biology has established that there is almost certainly no fixed programme for 
ageing, which is caused instead by the lifelong accumulation of damage. It is 
becoming evident that the ageing process is much more malleable than we used to 
think. We need urgently to establish the factors that govern this malleability 
and to identify the interactions between, on the one hand, intrinsic biological 
processes that drive the many chronic diseases and disabilities for which age is 
by far the largest risk factor and, on the other hand, the social and lifestyle 
factors that influence our individual trajectories of health in old age. Ageing 
is no longer as mysterious and intractable a process as used to be thought, 
offering new opportunities for contributions from other branches of the 
physiological sciences.

Autoimmunity in the Elderly: Insights from Basic Science and Clinics - A 
Mini-Review.

Advancements in the field of biomedicine, including the control of infectious 
diseases through antibiotics and vaccination practices and the prevention of 
chronic disorders, have led to reduced mortality, increased life expectancy and, 
as such, growth of the older population. Ageing is accompanied by profound 
morphological and physiological alterations. In particular, the immune system 
undergoes a complex series of remodeling/restructuring events, involving almost 
all compartments - both the innate and the adaptive system. This process is 
termed immunosenescence or immune dysregulation and, basically, includes 3 
events: a reduction in immune response, an increase in the inflammatory and 
oxidation background (inflammaging and oxi-inflammaging), and a production of 
autoantibodies. While there is an increase in autoimmunity in the elderly, this 
does not always translate into an increase in autoimmune diseases, which 
represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality and affect 5-10% of the 
world population. Each disease involves a specific age group. Generally 
speaking, most autoimmune diseases have a decreased peak age of onset, except 
for very few diseases such as giant cell arteritis and primary biliary 
cirrhosis, which are more prevalent among the elderly, or inflammatory bowel 
disease, which has 2 peaks of onset, the first one in young subjects and the 
other in those older than 60 years. Autoimmune disorders in the elderly have 
unique clinical presentations, and insidious and atypical symptoms may 
constitute a challenge for the physician. They are generally milder than in 
adults and can be controlled by a proper therapeutic treatment. However, despite 
advancements both in basic and clinical sciences, further studies and 
investigations are warranted and should be carried out in order to dissect the 
molecular framework induced by ageing.

OBJECTIVES: Subjective life expectancy (SLE) has been found to show a 
significant association with mortality. In this study, we aimed to investigate 
the major factors affecting SLE. We also examined whether any differences 
existed between SLE and actuarial life expectancy (LE) in Korea.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1000 individuals in Korea aged 20-59 was 
conducted. Participants were asked about SLE via a self-reported questionnaire. 
LE from the National Health Insurance database in Korea was used to evaluate 
differences between SLE and actuarial LE. Age-adjusted least-squares means, 
correlations, and regression analyses were used to test the relationship of SLE 
with four categories of predictors: demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, 
health behaviors, and psychosocial factors.
RESULTS: Among the 1000 participants, women (mean SLE, 83.43 years; 95% 
confidence interval, 82.41 to 84.46 years; 48% of the total sample) had an 
expected LE 1.59 years longer than that of men. The socioeconomic factors of 
household income and housing arrangements were related to SLE. Among the health 
behaviors, smoking status, alcohol status, and physical activity were associated 
with SLE. Among the psychosocial factors, stress, self-rated health, and social 
connectedness were related to SLE. SLE had a positive correlation with actuarial 
estimates (r=0.61, p<0.001). Gender, household income, history of smoking, and 
distress were related to the presence of a gap between SLE and actuarial LE.
CONCLUSIONS: Demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, health behaviors, and 
psychosocial factors showed significant associations with SLE, in the expected 
directions. Further studies are needed to determine the reasons for these 
results.

BACKGROUND: The added value of using a point-of-care (POC) troponin test in 
primary care to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is debated because test 
sensitivity is inadequate early after symptom onset. This study investigates the 
potential cost-utility of diagnosing ACS by a general practitioner (GP) when a 
POC troponin test is available versus GP assessment only.
METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was developed, representing a 
hypothetical cohort of the Dutch population (>35 years) consulting the GP with 
chest complaints. All health related consequences as well as cost consequences 
were included. Both symptom duration, selection of patients in whom the POC 
troponin test is performed, and test performance at different time points were 
incorporated. Health outcomes were expressed as Quality-Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs). The main outcome parameters involve the effect of POC troponin testing 
on (in)correct hospital referrals, QALYs, and costs.
RESULTS: The POC troponin strategy decreases the referral rate in non-ACS 
patients from 38.46% to 31.85%. Despite a small increase in non-referral among 
ACS patients from 0.22% to 0.27%, the overall health effect is negligible. Costs 
will decrease with €77.25/patient (95% CI €-126.81 to €-33.37).
CONCLUSIONS: The POC troponin strategy is likely cost-saving, by reducing 
hospital referrals. The small increase in missed ACS patients can be partly 
explained by conservative assumptions used in the analysis. Besides, current 
developments in POC troponin tests will likely further improve their diagnostic 
performance. Therefore, future prospective studies are warranted to investigate 
whether those developments make the POC troponin test to a safe and 
cost-effective diagnostic tool for diagnosing ACS in general practices.

BACKGROUND: Early HIV diagnosis reduces morbidity, mortality, the probability of 
onward transmission, and their associated costs, but might increase cost because 
of earlier initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART). We investigated this 
trade-off by estimating the cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in primary care.
METHODS: We modelled the effect of the four-times higher diagnosis rate observed 
in the intervention arm of the RHIVA2 randomised controlled trial done in 
Hackney, London (UK), a borough with high HIV prevalence (≥0·2% adult 
prevalence). We constructed a dynamic, compartmental model representing 
incidence of infection and the effect of screening for HIV in general practices 
in Hackney. We assessed cost-effectiveness of the RHIVA2 trial by fitting model 
diagnosis rates to the trial data, parameterising with epidemiological and 
behavioural data from the literature when required, using trial testing costs 
and projecting future costs of treatment.
FINDINGS: Over a 40 year time horizon, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were £22 201 (95% credible interval 12 662-132 452) per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained, £372 207 (268 162-1 903 385) per death averted, and 
£628 874 (434 902-4 740 724) per HIV transmission averted. Under this model 
scenario, with UK cost data, RHIVA2 would reach the upper National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence cost-effectiveness threshold (about £30 000 per QALY 
gained) after 33 years. Scenarios using cost data from Canada (which indicate 
prolonged and even higher health-care costs for patients diagnosed late) suggest 
this threshold could be reached in as little as 13 years.
INTERPRETATION: Screening for HIV in primary care has important public health 
benefits as well as clinical benefits. We predict it to be cost-effective in the 
UK in the medium term. However, this intervention might be cost-effective far 
sooner, and even cost-saving, in settings where long-term health-care costs of 
late-diagnosed patients in high-prevalence regions are much higher (≥60%) than 
those of patients diagnosed earlier. Screening for HIV in primary care is 
cost-effective and should be promoted.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is a rare autosomal inherited disorder 
associated with a high risk for patients to simultaneously develop tumors of the 
parathyroid glands, duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and tumors of the 
anterior pituitary gland. Early identification of MEN1 in patients enables 
presymptomatic screening of manifestations, which makes timely interventions 
possible with the intention to prevent morbidity and mortality. Causes of death 
nowadays have shifted toward local or metastatic progression of malignant 
neuroendocrine tumors. In early cohorts, complications like peptic ulcers in 
gastrinoma, renal failure in hyperparathyroidism, hypoglycemia and acute 
hypercalcemia were the primary causes of early mortality. Improved medical 
treatments of these complications led to a significantly improved life 
expectancy. The MEN1 landscape is still evolving, considering the finding of 
breast cancer as a new MEN1-related manifestation and ongoing publications on 
follow-up and medical care for patients with MEN1. This review aims at 
summarizing the most recent insights into the follow-up and medical care for 
patients with MEN1 and identifying the gaps for future research.

Calorie restriction (CR) may extend longevity by modulating the mechanisms 
involved in aging. Different hypotheses have been proposed for its main mode of 
action. We quantified hepatic transcripts of male C57BL/6 mice exposed to graded 
levels of CR (0% to 40% CR) for three months, and evaluated the responses 
relative to these various hypotheses. Of the four main signaling pathways 
implied to be linked to the impact of CR on lifespan (insulin/insulin like 
growth factor 1 (IGF-1), nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-ĸB), mechanistic target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) and sirtuins (SIRTs)), all the pathways except SIRT were 
altered in a manner consistent with increased lifespan. However, the expression 
levels of SIRT4 and SIRT7 were decreased with increasing levels of CR. Changes 
consistent with altered fuel utilization under CR may reduce reactive oxygen 
species production, which was paralleled by reduced protection. Downregulated 
major urinary protein (MUP) transcription suggested reduced reproductive 
investment. Graded CR had a positive effect on autophagy and xenobiotic 
metabolism, and was protective with respect to cancer signaling. CR had no 
significant effect on fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) transcription but 
affected transcription in the hydrogen sulfide production pathway. Responses to 
CR were consistent with several different hypotheses, and the benefits of CR on 
lifespan likely reflect the combined impact on multiple aging related processes.

INTRODUCTION: Fractures on pathologic bone have major impact on life quality. 
The appropriate treatment is not standardized, but the current literature 
delineates that surgery must provide adequate stabilization for the life 
expectancy. We aimed to review the epidemiology, treatment outcomes and survival 
in our department.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The electronic database from a major referral centre was 
searched for patients treated for tumours and fractures by the corresponding 
ICM-10 codes over five years. Eighty-nine patients were identified. Eleven 
females and nine males, with an average age of 64 years underwent 23 operations 
during the selected timeframe. Six fractures were subtrochanteric, five at the 
femoral neck and five at the femoral diaphysis. Seventeen cases were metastatic 
carcinomas, out of which five mammary, three pulmonary and seven carcinomas of 
undetermined origin without immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Fourteen types of surgical intervention were osteosynthesis with 
intramedullary nails and six were partial hip replacements of which one had 
proximal femur resection and revision stem hemiarthroplasty. Four patients had 
single metastatic lesions which underwent resection and defect filling using 
PMMA cement (polymethylmethacrylate). The follow-up period ranged between two 
and seven years or until death. Only five patients (25%) were alive at the last 
follow-up. Local recurrence appeared in one patient. There was one immediate 
post-operative complication (dehiscent wound) and one implant failure after five 
years and was replaced with a larger diameter (exchange nailing).
CONCLUSION: Both hip arthroplasty and femoral nailing are safe and routine 
procedures that are performed with relatively technical ease and low surgical 
stress and few peri-operative complications for the patient. They allow for 
immediate mobilization and weight-bearing with moderate and rapidly decreasing 
pain and discomfort.

It has been suggested that age-related neurodegeneration might be associated 
with neuropeptide Y (NPY); sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and forkhead box transcription 
factors O subfamily (FOXOs) pathways. Melatonin, a hormone mainly secreted by 
the pineal gland, is another anti-aging agent associated with the SIRT1-FOXOs 
pathway. This study aimed to compare the effects of melatonin (Mel) and caloric 
restriction (CR) on the expression of Sirt1, FoxO1, FoxO3a and FOXOs target 
genes in the aging mouse hippocampus. Neuropeptide Y-knockout (NpyKO) and 
wild-type (WT) male mice aged 19 months were previously treated either with food 
ad libitum or CR for 16 months. WT old animals were divided into four groups: 
control, CR, Mel and CR+Mel treated groups. The Mel and CR+Mel were treated with 
melatonin 10 mg/kg, daily, subcutaneously for 7 consecutive days. Mel treatment 
upregulated the mRNA expression of Sirt1, FOXOs (FoxO1 and FoxO3a) target genes 
that regulated the cell cycle [e.g., cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B 
(p27)], Wingless and INT-1 (Wnt1) and inducible signaling pathway protein 1 
(Wisp1) in the aged mouse hippocampus. CR treatment also showed the similar 
actions. However, the mRNA expression of Sirt1, FoxO1, FoxO3a, p27 or Wisp1 did 
not alter in the CR+Mel group when compared with CR or Mel group. Melatonin 
could not produce any additive effect on the CR treatment group, suggesting that 
both treatments mimicked the effect, possibly via the same pathway. NPY which 
mediates physiological adaptations to energy deficits is an essential link 
between CR and longevity in mice. In order to focus on the role of Npy in 
mediating the effects of melatonin, the gene expression between NpyKO and WT 
male mice were compared. Our data showed that, in the absence of Npy, melatonin 
could not mediate effects on those gene expressions, suggesting that Npy was 
required for melatonin to mediate the effect, possibly, on life extension.

As part of its single technology appraisal process, the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence invited the manufacturer of pertuzumab (Perjeta®; 
Roche Products Limited) to submit evidence of its clinical and cost- 
effectiveness for the neoadjuvant treatment of women with high-risk, 
early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer when used in combination with 
trastuzumab and chemotherapy. High-risk women included those with locally 
advanced (including inflammatory) breast cancer and women with high-risk 
early-stage breast cancer (classified as T2/3 or N1). The School of Health and 
Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was 
commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article 
presents the critical review of the company's submission by the Evidence Review 
Group and the outcome of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidance. The clinical data were mainly taken from a phase II, randomised, 
open-label, active controlled study (NeoSphere), which reported a significant 
advantage in terms of pathological complete response rates of pertuzumab in 
combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, compared with trastuzumab alone 
with chemotherapy (45.8 vs. 29.0%, p = 0.0141). The company did not make any 
indirect comparisons. A meta-analysis of 12 neoadjuvant studies investigating 
the relationship between pathological complete response and event-free survival 
was used to extrapolate the outcomes reported in the NeoSphere study. A cardiac 
safety study (TRYPHAENA) demonstrated the safety of pertuzumab. The company 
undertook a model-based economic evaluation of neoadjuvant pertuzumab plus 
trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel 
over a lifetime horizon from the National Health Service and Personal Social 
Services perspective. The probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
estimated to be £20,104 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for pertuzumab 
alongside trastuzumab and docetaxel compared with trastuzumab and docetaxel, 
which was revised to £21,869 per quality-adjusted life-year gained following the 
clarification process. The Evidence Review Group corrected an error in the 
digitisation of the survivor functions and modified the clinically inappropriate 
assumption that recurrence is zero after 7 years. The Evidence Review Group's 
probabilistic base case was £23,962 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. 
During the appraisal, to mitigate the uncertainties associated with the 
evidence, the company offered a patient access scheme, which led to the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee recommending 
pertuzumab in this patient group, subject to the company providing the agreed 
discount in the patient access scheme.

Noncovalent binding of biopharmaceuticals to human serum albumin protects 
against enzymatic degradation and renal clearance. Herein, we investigated the 
effect of mono- or divalent small-molecule albumin binders for half-life 
extension of peptides. For proof-of-principle, the clinically relevant 
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was functionalized with diflunisal, 
indomethacin, or both. In vitro, all GLP-1 analogues had subnanomolar GLP-1 
receptor potency. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that both small molecules 
were able to confer albumin affinity to GLP-1 and indicated that affinity is 
increased for divalent analogues. In lean mice, the divalent GLP-1 analogues 
were superior to monovalent analogues with respect to control of glucose 
homeostasis and suppression of food intake. Importantly, divalent GLP-1 
analogues showed efficacy comparable to liraglutide, an antidiabetic GLP-1 
analogue that carries a long-chain fatty acid. Finally, pharmacokinetic 
investigations of a divalent GLP-1 analogue demonstrated a promising gain in 
circulatory half-life and absorption time compared to its monovalent equivalent.

OBJECTIVES: We compared cost-effectiveness of cranial computed tomography (CT), 
fast sequence magnetic resonance imaging (fsMRI), and ultrasonography 
measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) for suspected acute shunt 
failure from the perspective of a health care organization.
METHODS: We modeled 4 diagnostic imaging strategies: (1) CT scan, (2) fsMRI, (3) 
screening ONSD by using point of care ultrasound (POCUS) first, combined with 
CT, and (4) screening ONSD by using POCUS first, combined with fsMRI. All 
patients received an initial plain radiographic shunt series (SS). Short- and 
long-term costs of radiation-induced cancer were assessed with a Markov model. 
Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life-years. Utilities and inputs 
for clinical variables were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: At a previous probability of shunt failure of 30%, a screening POCUS in 
patients with a normal SS was the most cost-effective. For children with 
abnormal SS or ONSD measurement, fsMRI was the preferred option over CT. 
Performing fsMRI on all patients would cost $269 770 to gain 1 additional 
quality-adjusted life-year compared with POCUS. An imaging pathway that involves 
CT alone was dominated by ONSD and fsMRI because it was more expensive and less 
effective.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with low pretest probability of cranial shunt failure, 
an ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD is the preferred initial screening test. 
fsMRI is the more cost-effective, definitive imaging test when compared with 
cranial CT.

Notes from the Field: Preliminary Results After Implementation of a Universal 
Treatment Program (Test and Start) for Persons Living with HIV Infection - 
Lesotho, October 2015-February 2017.

Lesotho, a small, mountainous country completely surrounded by the Republic of 
South Africa, has a population of approximately 2 million persons with an 
estimated gross national income of $1,280 per capita; 73% of the population 
resides in rural areas (1). Lesotho has a generalized human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) epidemic (2). In 2014, the prevalence of HIV infection among persons 
aged 15-49 years was 24.6%, with an incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100 
person-years of exposure (3). As the leading cause of premature death, HIV/AIDS 
(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has contributed to Lesotho's reporting the 
shortest life expectancy at birth among 195 countries and territories (4). In 
2015, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive persons in 
Lesotho was estimated to be 42% (5). In April 2016, Lesotho became the first 
country in sub-Saharan Africa to adopt the World Health Organization (WHO) 
recommendations for universal initiation of antiretroviral therapy for all 
HIV-positive persons, regardless of CD4 count (known as the "Test and Start" 
program or approach), with nationwide implementation occurring in June 2016 
(6,7). Before implementation of Test and Start, many persons living with HIV 
infection in Lesotho were not eligible to initiate treatment until their CD4 
count was <500 cells/mm3.

MicroRNA-212 inhibits oligodendrocytes during maturation by down-regulation of 
differentiation-associated gene expression.

MicroRNA-212 (mir-212) has been reported to regulate neuronal development and 
functioning. However, its expression and function in glia are not yet known. 
Here, we demonstrate that the level of microRNA-212 (mir-212) was reduced in 
spinal cord lesion site at 1 week and 1 month after a contusive spinal cord 
injury. In addition to its expression in neurons, mir-212 expression was 
detected in oligodendrocytes (OLGs) and glial progenitor cells (GPCs) in adult 
CNS. The addition of antagomir-212 to reduce mir-212 expression enabled to 
improve the cell process outgrowth of OLGs along with the up-regulation of the 
genes associated with OLG differentiation and maturation, including OLIG1, 
SOX10, myelin basic protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). In 
contrast, these genes were significantly down-regulated by an increased 
expression of mir-212 in GPCs or in OLG progenitor cells (OPCs) through 
lentivirus-mediated gene delivery approach. Moreover, we found that PLP1 was the 
direct target molecule of mir-212. Furthermore, mir-212 over-expression 
diminished the protein production of OLGs markers including 
2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), MBP, and PLP. 
Additionally, mir-212 over-expression decreased the number of mature OLGs 
expressing MBP, and the expression of galactocerebroside (GC). Complementary 
studies in a hippocampal neuron-OLG co-culture model and an ex vivo cerebellar 
slice system indicated that OLGs derived from GPCs with mir-212 over-expression 
exhibited decreased ability to interact with neuronal axons. Collectively, our 
findings demonstrate that mir-212 repressed the expression of OLG 
maturation-associated proteins and inhibited OLG cell process extension, 
indicating that mir-212 has negative regulatory effect on OLG lineage 
progression.

Selective Percutaneous Controlled Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation of the 
Gasserian Ganglion To Control Facial Pain Due to Medication-Related 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw.

Medicine , Kyoto, Japan .

BACKGROUND: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is an important 
complication in patients treated with antiresorptive agents such as 
bisphosphonates and the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand inhibitor 
(denosumab). Treatment of MRONJ is extremely difficult, which makes it a 
distressing long-term complication.
OBJECTIVES: We report a case of intractable facial pain due to MRONJ that was 
successfully controlled with selective percutaneous controlled radiofrequency 
thermocoagulation of the Gasserian ganglion.
SETTING: A 68-year-old woman with breast cancer was diagnosed as having MRONJ. 
She was very distressed because of jaw pain and infections secondary to MRONJ. 
Her quality of life (QOL) was severely decreased. Since alleviation of the MRONJ 
could not be expected within the patient's life expectancy, it was decided to 
investigate the usefulness of selective percutaneous controlled radiofrequency 
thermocoagulation of the Gasserian ganglion to control the pain.
RESULTS: After the procedure, the anesthesia was obtained in the distribution of 
the third branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the pain completely disappeared. 
Although hypoesthesia was provoked as a complication, it was tolerated by the 
patient and she was very satisfied. Up to the time of death, there was no 
recurrence of pain or worsening of the MRONJ.
DISCUSSION: This procedure is a common technique for treating trigeminal 
neuralgia. Its effect is immediate and long lasting, although it provokes 
hypoesthesia in treated division, and it is also suited for cancer patients in 
terminal stage. This case suggests that the procedure was useful for improving 
the patient's QOL.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of heart failure is increasing in Lebanon but to date 
there is no systematic evaluation of a disease management intervention.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of involving family 
caregivers in the self-care of patients with heart failure on the risk of 
hospital readmission.
DESIGN: A multi-site, block randomised controlled trial.
SETTINGS: The study was conducted over a 13-month period in three tertiary 
medical centres in Beirut and Mount Lebanon, Lebanon.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients presenting for an exacerbation of heart failure to 
one of the study centres were included. Patients with limited life expectancy or 
physical functionality, planned cardiac bypass or valve replacement surgery, 
living alone or in nursing homes, or aged less than 18 years were excluded.
METHODS: Patients allocated to the intervention group and their family 
caregivers were provided with a comprehensive, culturally appropriate, 
educational session on self-care maintenance and symptom management along with 
self-care resources. The usual care group received the self-care resources only. 
Follow-up phone calls were conducted 30days following discharge by a research 
assistant blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was hospital 
readmission and the secondary outcomes were self-care, quality of life, major 
vascular events and healthcare utilization.
RESULTS: The final sample included 256 patients hospitalized for heart failure 
randomised into control (130 patients) and intervention (126 patients) groups. 
The mean age was 67 (SD=8)years, and the majority (55%) were male. Readmission 
at 30days was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the 
control group (n=10, 9% vs. n=20, 19% respectively, OR=0.40, 95% CI=0.02, 0.10, 
p=0.02). Self-care scores improved in both groups at 30days, with a 
significantly larger improvement in the intervention group than the control 
group in the maintenance and confidence sub-scales, but not in the self-care 
management sub-scale. No differences were seen in quality of life scores or 
emergency department presentations between the groups. More patients in the 
control group than in the intervention group visited health care facilities 
(n=24, 23% vs. n=12, 11% respectively, OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.18, 0.83, p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: The trial results confirmed the potential of the family-centred 
self-care educational intervention under evaluation to reduce the risk of 
readmission in Lebanese patients suffering from exacerbated heart failure. 
Further research is needed to validate these findings with longer periods of 
follow-up and to identify the intervention components and intensity required to 
induce sustained benefits on patients' self-care management and quality of life.
