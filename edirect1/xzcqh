OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the trends in disease burden and the epidemiological 
features of liver cancer in China while identifying potential strategies to 
lower the disease burden.
DESIGN: Observational study based on the Global Burden of Diseases.
PARTICIPANTS: Data were publicly available and de-identified and individuals 
were not involved.
MEASUREMENT AND METHODS: To measure the liver cancer burden, we extracted data 
from the Global Health Data Exchange using the metrics of prevalence, incidence, 
mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Joinpoint and negative 
binomial regressions were applied to identify trends and risk factors.
RESULTS: From 1997 to 2016, the prevalence, incidence, mortality and DALYs of 
liver cancer in China were from 28.22/100 000 to 60.04/100 000, from 27.33/100 
000 to 41.40/100 000, from 27.40/100 000 to 31.49/100 000 and from 10 311 308 to 
11 539 102, respectively. The prevalence, incidence and mortality were 
increasing, with the average annual percent changes (AAPCs) of 4.0% (95% CI 3.9% 
to 4.2%), 2.1% (95% CI 2.0% to 2.2%) and 0.5% (95% CI 0.2% to 0.9%), 
respectively. Meanwhile, the rate of DALYs was stable with the AAPCs of -0.1% 
(95% CI -0.4% to 0.3%). The mortality-to-incidence ratio of liver cancer 
decreased from 1.00 in 1997 to 0.76 in 2016 (β=-0.014, p<0.0001). Males (OR: 
2.98, 95% CI 2.68 to 3.30 for prevalence, OR: 2.45, 95% CI 2.21 to 2.71 for 
incidence) and the elderly individuals (OR: 1.57, 95% CI 1.55 to 1.59 for 
prevalence, OR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.60 for incidence) had a higher risk. 
Hepatitis B accounted for the highest proportion of liver cancer cases (55.11%) 
and deaths (54.13%).
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of liver cancer continued to increase in China 
with viral factors as one of the leading causes. Strategies such as promoting 
hepatitis B vaccinations, blocking the transmission of hepatitis C and reducing 
alcohol consumption should be prioritised.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is followed by secondary injury mechanisms strongly 
involving neuroinflammation. To monitor the complex inflammatory cascade in 
human TBI, we used cerebral microdialysis (MD) and multiplex proximity extension 
assay (PEA) technology and simultaneously measured levels of 92 protein 
biomarkers of inflammation in MD samples every three hours for five days in 10 
patients with severe TBI under neurointensive care. One μL MD samples were 
incubated with paired oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies binding to each 
protein, allowing quantification by real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction. Sixty-nine proteins were suitable for statistical analysis. We found 
five different patterns with either early (<48 h; e.g., CCL20, IL6, LIF, CCL3), 
mid (48-96 h; e.g., CCL19, CXCL5, CXCL10, MMP1), late (>96 h; e.g., CD40, MCP2, 
MCP3), biphasic peaks (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL5, IL8) or stable (e.g., CCL4, DNER, 
VEGFA)/low trends. High protein levels were observed for e.g., CXCL1, CXCL10, 
MCP1, MCP2, IL8, while e.g., CCL28 and MCP4 were detected at low levels. Several 
proteins (CCL8, -19, -20, -23, CXCL1, -5, -6, -9, -11, CST5, DNER, Flt3L, and 
SIRT2) have not been studied previously in human TBI. Cross-correlation analysis 
revealed that LIF and CXCL5 may play a central role in the inflammatory cascade. 
This study provides a unique data set with individual temporal trends for 
potential inflammatory biomarkers in patients with TBI. We conclude that the 
combination of MD and PEA is a powerful tool to map the complex inflammatory 
cascade in the injured human brain. The technique offers new possibilities of 
protein profiling of complex secondary injury pathways.

How Do Pharmaceutical Companies Model Survival of Cancer Patients? A Review of 
NICE Single Technology Appraisals in 2017.

OBJECTIVES: Before an intervention is publicly funded within the United Kingdom, 
the cost-effectiveness is assessed by the National Institute of Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE). The efficacy of an intervention across the patients' lifetime 
is often influential of the cost-effectiveness analyses, but is associated with 
large uncertainties. We reviewed committee documents containing company 
submissions and evidence review group (ERG) reports to establish the methods 
used when extrapolating survival data, whether these adhered to NICE Technical 
Support Document (TSD) 14, and how uncertainty was addressed.
METHODS: A systematic search was completed on the NHS Evidence Search webpage 
limited to single technology appraisals of cancer interventions published in 
2017, with information obtained from the NICE Web site.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight appraisals were identified, covering twenty-two 
interventions across eighteen diseases. Every economic model used parametric 
curves to model survival. All submissions used goodness-of-fit statistics and 
plausibility of extrapolations when selecting a parametric curve. Twenty-five 
submissions considered alternate parametric curves in scenario analyses. Six 
submissions reported including the parameters of the survival curves in the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. ERGs agreed with the company's choice of 
parametric curve in nine appraisals, and agreed with all major survival-related 
assumptions in two appraisals.
CONCLUSIONS: TSD 14 on survival extrapolation was followed in all appraisals. 
Despite this, the choice of parametric curve remains subjective. Recent 
developments in Bayesian approaches to extrapolation are not implemented. More 
precise guidance on the selection of curves and modelling of uncertainty may 
reduce subjectivity, accelerating the appraisal process.

Biological invasions are increasingly being considered important spatial 
processes that drive global changes, threatening biodiversity, regional 
economies, and ecosystem functions. A unifying conceptual model of the invasion 
dynamics could serve as a useful tool for comparison and classification of 
invasion processes involving different species across large geographic ranges. 
By dividing these geographic ranges that are subject to invasions into discrete 
spatial units, we here conceptualize the invasion process as the transition from 
pristine to invaded spatial units. We use California cities as the spatial units 
and a long-term database of invasive tropical tephritids to characterize the 
invasion patterns. A new life-table method based on insect demography, including 
the progression model of invasion stage transition and the species-specific 
partitioning model of multispecies invasions, was developed to analyze the 
invasion patterns. The progression model allows us to estimate the probability 
and rate of transition for individual cities from pristine to infested stages 
and subsequently differentiate the first year of detection from detection 
recurrences. Importantly, we show that the interval of invasive tephritid 
recurrence in a city declines with increasing invasion stages of the city. The 
species-specific partitioning model revealed profound differences in invasion 
outcome depending on which tephritid species was first detected (and then 
locally eradicated) in the early stage of invasion. Taken together, we discuss 
how these two life-table invasion models can cast new light on existing invasion 
concepts; in particular, on formulating invasion dynamics as the state 
transition of cities and partitioning species-specific roles during multispecies 
invasions. These models provide a new set of tools for predicting the 
spatiotemporal progression of invasion and providing early warnings of recurrent 
invasions for efficient management.

The shelf-life extension implicates the reduction of food waste. Plant 
polyphenols can have a crucial role in the shelf-life extension of foods. Olive 
leaf extract (OLE) is rich in phenolic compounds such as oleuropein, which is 
well-known for its antioxidant properties. Physico-chemical, microbiological and 
sensory aspects of non-thermally stabilized olive-based pâté fortified with OLE 
at concentrations of 0.5 (EX0.5) and 1 mg kg-1 (EX1) were investigated. These 
samples were compared with olive-based pâté fortified with the synthetic 
antioxidant BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and with a control sample (CTR) 
without antioxidants. No sensory defects were perceived in all samples, even if 
a more intense typical olive flavour was perceived in samples containing OLE 
compared to those containing BHT and CTR. This result was confirmed by 
significantly higher levels of 2-methylbutanal and 3-methylbutanal in samples 
containing OLE compared to CTR and BHT. Moreover, the main microbial groups 
registered a significant loss of 0.5-1 logarithmic cycles in samples containing 
OLE, especially in EX1. The results of the present study indicate the 
potentiality of using OLE as natural preservatives in non-thermally stabilized 
olive-based pâté, since some spoilage-related microbial groups were negatively 
affected by the addition of OLE at the highest concentration.

Objectives: Eight years of panel data are used to investigate the association 
between three dimensions of religiosity and total and disability-free life 
expectancy (TLE/DFLE) in Taiwan. Method: Data come from the 1999 "Taiwan 
Longitudinal Study on Aging" (TLSA; N = 4,440; Age 55+). Dimensions of 
religiosity are public, private, belief, and coping. Mortality is linked to a 
national database. Disability is activities of daily living (ADLs). TLE/DFLE 
estimates use the Stochastic Population Analysis for Complex Events (SPACE) 
software. Results: Those who engage in public and private religiosity live 
longer and more years disability-free than others, but proportion of life 
disability-free does not differ across levels of religiosity. Coping is less 
associated with TLE and DFLE. Coping however associates with more years disabled 
among men. Findings are robust to model specifications. Discussion: The way in 
which religiosity associates with health depends upon the definition. When it 
does associate, religiosity increases TLE and DFLE proportionately.

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop pulmonary disease secondary to airway 
infection and dysregulated inflammation. Therapeutic innovations such as 
nebulized antimicrobial therapy targeting specific pathogens have resulted in 
improvements in quality of life and life expectancy. Aztreonam lysine for 
inhalation (AZLI) solution was initially approved to improve respiratory 
symptoms in CF patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in 2010 by the Food and 
Drug Administration. Since then, research broadening labeling and clinical 
application has been developed. In this review, we analyze published and ongoing 
research regarding AZLI therapy in CF. A search of the Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews and the PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases was conducted 
to identify publications about AZLI. Three pre-approval studies were identified 
and assessed. Two are Phase 3, placebo-controlled trials, assessing a variety of 
safety and efficacy endpoints, leading to FDA approval. The third is an 
open-label extension of the two previous trials. An additional seven 
post-approval, completed trials were identified and are included in this review. 
They represent a variety of study designs including safety and efficacy in 
patients with mild lung disease and young patients, an active comparator trial 
vs inhaled tobramycin, an eradication study, a study among patients with 
Burkholderia cepacia, and a study assessing continuous alternating antibiotic 
therapy. Finally, five ongoing clinical trials are discussed. Overall, studies 
demonstrated that inhaled aztreonam is a safe and effective antimicrobial 
treatment for the eradication of newly acquired P. aeruginosa and long-term 
suppressive therapy of chronic endobronchial infection among people with cystic 
fibrosis.

Diapause is a form of dormancy used by many insects to survive adverse 
environmental conditions, which can occur in specific developmental stages in 
different species. Drosophila suzukii is a serious economic pest and we 
determined the conditions for adult reproductive diapause by the females in our 
previous studies. In this study, we combined RNA-Seq transcriptomic and 
quantitative proteomic analyses to identify adult reproductive diapause-related 
genes and proteins. According to the transcriptomic analysis, among 242 
annotated differentially expressed genes in non-diapause and diapause females, 
129 and 113 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. In addition, among 
the 2,375 proteins quantified, 39 and 23 proteins were up- and down-regulated, 
respectively. The gene expression patterns in diapause- and non-diapause were 
confirmed by qRT-PCR or western blot analysis. The overall analysis of robustly 
regulated genes at the protein and mRNA levels found four genes that overlapped 
in the up-regulated group and six genes in the down-regulated group, and thus 
these proteins/genes may regulate adult reproductive diapause. These 
differentially expressed proteins/genes act in the citrate cycle, insulin 
signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and amino acid biosynthesis 
pathways. These results provide the basis for further studies of the molecular 
regulation of reproductive diapause in this species.

During the natural history of oncologic diseases, approximately 20-40% of 
patients affected by cancer will develop brain metastases. Non-small lung 
cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are the primaries that are most likely to 
metastasize into the brain. To date, the role of Radiosurgery/Stereotactic 
Radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) without Whole brain irradiation (WBRT) is a 
well-recognized treatment option for patients with limited intracranial disease 
(1-4 BMs) and a life-expectancy of more than 3-6 months. In the current review, 
we focused on randomized studies that evaluate the potential benefit of 
radiosurgery/stereotactic radiotherapy for brain oligometastases. To date, no 
difference in overall survival has been observed between SRS/SRT alone compared 
to WBRT plus SRS. Notably, SRS alone achieved higher local control rates 
compared to WBRT. A possible strength of SRS adoption is the potential decreased 
neurocognitive impairment.

The number of older homeless people with a limited life expectancy is 
increasing. European studies on their health-related characteristics are 
lacking. This study compared self-reported health, healthcare service use and 
health-related needs of older and younger homeless people in the Netherlands. It 
is part of a cohort study that followed 513 homeless people in the four major 
Dutch cities for a period of 2.5 years, starting from the moment they registered 
at the social relief system in 2011. Using cross-sectional data from 378 
participants who completed 2.5-year follow-up, we analysed differences in 
self-reported health, healthcare service use, and health-related needs between 
homeless adults aged ≥50 years (N = 97) and <50 years (N = 281) by means of 
logistic regression. Results show that statistically significantly more older 
than younger homeless people reported cardiovascular diseases (23.7% versus 
10.3%), visual problems (26.8% versus 14.6%), limited social support from family 
(33.0% versus 19.6%) and friends or acquaintances (27.8% versus 14.6%), and 
medical hospital care use in the past year (50.5% versus 34.5%). Older homeless 
people statistically significantly less often reported cannabis (12.4% versus 
45.2%) and excessive alcohol (16.5% versus 27.0%) use in the past month and 
dental (20.6% versus 46.6%) and mental (16.5% versus 25.6%) healthcare use in 
the past year. In both age groups, few people reported unmet health-related 
needs. In conclusion, compared to younger homeless adults, older homeless adults 
report fewer substance use problems, but a similar number of dental and mental 
problems, and more physical and social problems. The multiple health problems 
experienced by both age groups are not always expressed as needs or addressed by 
healthcare services. Older homeless people seem to use more medical hospital 
care and less non-acute, preventive healthcare than younger homeless people. 
This vulnerable group might benefit from shelter-based or community outreach 
programmes that proactively provide multidisciplinary healthcare services.

Mass, Strength and Function in the Elderly: A Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analysis.

BACKGROUND: The loss of muscle mass, strength and function associated with 
increasing age has various health ramifications, including the elevated risk for 
falls, fractures, frailty, poor quality of life, and mortality. Several studies 
have confirmed the effects of protein supplementation and RT (resistance 
training) for this age-related change independently, but whether a combination 
of the two produces a stronger effect remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore whether a combination of protein 
supplementation and RT leads to reduction of muscle mass, strength and function 
in the elderly.
METHODS: We retrieved RCTs (randomized controlled trials) reporting the effects 
of protein supplementation combined with RT on muscle mass, strength and 
function in the elderly, published before May 2018 through PubMed, MEDLINE, 
Embase, and manual searches.
RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were included, involving 1,249 participants. The 
results showed that protein supplementation combine with RT significantly 
enhances the muscle mass and strength of the older adults, where FFM (fat-free 
mass) increased by 0.23 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 0.38; P=0.002), ASMM (appendicular 
skeletal muscle mass) by 0.39 kg (95% CI: 0.14, 0.64; P=0.002), handgrip 
strength by 0.29 kg (95% CI: 0.08, 0.50; P=0.008), knee extension strength by 
0.27 kg (95% CI: 0.06, 0.47; P=0.013), leg press strength by 0.33 kg (95% CI: 
0.01, 0.64; P=0.04), but no significant effects were seen on muscle function.
CONCLUSION: Compared to simple RT, protein supplementation combine with RT is 
more effective in enhancing the muscle mass and strength in the elderly, and the 
findings do not support the benefit of combination treatment for muscle 
function.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To examine if there has been a reduction in premature 
mortality due to head and neck cancers and their subtypes in the Canadian 
population between 1980 and 2010.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review.
METHODS: Mortality data for head and neck cancers were obtained from the World 
Health Organization's mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was 
calculated according to Canadian life tables. A new measure, average lifespan 
shortened (ALSS), was calculated as a ratio of YLL over the expected lifespan.
RESULTS: During the period of interest, decreases in age standardized rates of 
death adjusted to the World Standard Population were observed mainly among men. 
The adjusted YLL rates remained unchanged with respect to oral cancers in women, 
but slightly decreased for oral cancers in men and for laryngeal cancers in both 
sexes. Our new measure of ALSS showed that in 1980, patients with oral cancers 
lost an average of 20% of their lifespan, whereas in 2010, men and women still 
lost approximately 20% and 18%, respectively. Patients with laryngeal cancers 
lost 18% of their lifespan in both sexes in 1980 and 17% in 2010. The ALSS 
subanalysis showed that the largest gain of lifespan was observed for cancers of 
the hypopharynx in men and for cancers of the floor of mouth and nasopharynx in 
women.
CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be modest improvements in premature mortality due 
to head and neck cancers in Canada over a 30-year period, with the exception of 
oral cancers in men. Changes in premature mortality varied slightly by cancer 
subtypes.

BACKGROUND: First-generation antihistamines (FGAs) are classified as 
'potentially inappropriate' for use in older patients (patients aged ≥ 65 
years). However, the prevalence of and factors associated with FGA prescription 
have not been studied.
OBJECTIVES: To examine FGA prescription rates for older patients who visited 
dermatology offices, and compare them to those for younger patients (patients 
aged 18-65 years) who visited dermatology offices and those for older patients 
who visited primary-care physicians (PCPs).
METHODS: This was a multiyear cross-sectional observational study using data 
from the U.S. National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2006-2015). Visits by 
patients aged 18 years or older were included in the study; the data comprised 
15 243 dermatology office visits and 66 036 PCP office visits. The main outcome 
was FGA prescription. Other variables included physician specialty 
(dermatologist or PCP), patient's age, diagnosis of dermatological conditions 
and reason for visit.
RESULTS: For dermatology visits, the overall FGA prescription rate for older 
patients was similar to that for younger patients (1·5% vs. 1·2%; P = 0·19), 
even when the diagnosis was dermatitis or pruritus (3·7% vs. 4·8%; P = 0·21) or 
when itch was a complaint (7·6% vs. 6·7%; P = 0·64). However, the rate of FGA 
prescription for dermatology visits was lower than that for PCP visits, in 
analyses matched for patient and visit characteristics (3·9% vs. 7·4%; P = 
0·02).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that FGAs are overprescribed to older patients 
but that dermatologists are less likely to prescribe FGAs than PCPs. What's 
already known about this topic? First-generation antihistamines (FGAs) have been 
shown to pose substantial risks to older adults, including cognitive impairment, 
falls, confusion, dry mouth and constipation. Therefore, FGAs have been 
classified as 'potentially inappropriate' for use in older patients by the 
American Geriatrics Society. It has also been shown that dermatologists do not 
always take patient characteristics (e.g. age or life expectancy) into account 
when deciding on a treatment, instead following a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. 
What does this study add? FGAs are often prescribed during dermatology visits, 
and prescription rates do not differ between older and younger patients. There 
were no significant differences in prescription rates when comparing younger and 
older adults with the same diagnosis or symptom (e.g. dermatitis, pruritus or 
itch). FGAs are prescribed at higher rates in primary-care offices than in 
dermatology offices.

Will Biotechnology Stop Aging?

Campbell S.

Could biotechnology stop aging? The answer may be yes, no, or something in 
between, depending on who is being asked and what it means to "stop" aging. For 
those at one end of the spectrum- life extension seekers (including some 
deep-pocketed Silicon Valley investors)-the answer is "yes." They believe 
biotechnology will lengthen human life spans to range anywhere from 1,000 years 
to forever. But for most, the answer is more nuanced and in- volves a dream of 
extended healthspan, rather than immortality. They imagine a future in which 
people over the age of 65 years are healthy, active, independent, and not 
burdened by disease, and that this is the norm rather than the exception. 
"Healthspanners" believe that one day, science will delay the onset of 
aging-related conditions and, as a side-effect, modestly extend life. Aging as 
we know it-and dread it-could become ancient history.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 models of exercise-based cardiac 
rehabilitation (CR) compared with standard care in survivors of acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) within the public health system in Chile.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed using 5 health states: ACS survivor, second 
ACS, complications, general mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. The 
transition probabilities between health states for standard care and 
corresponding relative risk for CR were calculated from a systematic review. 
Health benefits were measured with the EuroQol 5-dimensional 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) 
survey. Costs for each health state were quantified using the national cost 
verification study. The CR cost was estimated with a microcosting methodology. 
The time horizon was a lifetime and the discount rate was 3% per year for costs 
and benefits. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were performed. 
Structural uncertainty was managed by designing 3 scenarios: CR as currently 
delivered in a specific Chilean public health center, CR as recommended by South 
American guidelines, and CR as proposed for low-resource settings.
RESULTS: Cardiac rehabilitation versus standard care showed an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for the standard model of $722, for the South American 
model of $1247, and for the low-resource model of $666. The tornado diagram 
showed higher uncertainty in relative risk for the complications state and for 
the second ACS state.
CONCLUSION: Considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 unit of gross 
domestic product per capita (∼$19 000), CR is highly cost-effective for the 
public health system in Chile.

The production of maple syrup is an important cultural and economic activity 
directly related to the climate of northeastern North America. As a result, 
there are signs that climate change could have negative impacts on maple syrup 
production in the next decades, particularly for regions located at the southern 
margins of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) range. The purpose of this 
survey study is to present the beliefs and opinions of maple syrup producers of 
Canada (N = 241) and the U.S. (N = 113) on climate change in general, its 
impacts on sugar maple health and maple syrup production, and potential 
adaptation measures. Using conditional inference classification trees, we 
examined how the socio-economic profile of respondents and the geographic 
location and size of respondents' sugar bushes shaped the responses of survey 
participants. While a majority (75%) of respondents are confident that the 
average temperature on Earth is increasing, less than half (46%) believe that 
climate change will have negative impacts on maple syrup yield in the next 30 
years. Political view was a significant predictor of these results, with 
respondents at the right right and center-right of the political spectrum being 
less likely to believe in climate change and less likely to anticipate negative 
effects of climate change on maple syrup production. In addition, 77% of the 
participants indicated an interest in adopting adaptation strategies if those 
could increase maple syrup production. This interest was greater for respondents 
using vacuum tubing for sap collection than other collection methods. However, 
for many respondents (particularly in Canada), lack of information was 
identified as a constraint limiting adaptation to climate change.

OBJECTIVES: Using the findings of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), we 
report the burden of primary headache disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region (EMR) from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: We modelled headache disorders using DisMod-MR 2.1 Bayesian 
meta-regression tool to ensure consistency between prevalence, incidence, and 
remission. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying 
prevalence and disability weight (DW) of migraine and tension-type headache 
(TTH). We assumed primary headache disorders as non-fatal, so their YLD is equal 
to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: Migraine and TTH were the second and twentieth leading causes of YLDs 
in EMR. Between 1990 and 2016, the absolute YLD numbers of migraine and TTH 
increased from 2.3 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.5-3.2) to 4.7 
million (95%UI: 3-6.5) and from 383 thousand (95%UI: 240-562) to 816 thousand 
(95%UI: 516-1221), respectively. During the same period, age-standardised YLD 
rates of migraine and TTH in EMR increased by 0.7% and 2.5%, respectively, in 
comparison to a small decrease in the global rates (0.2% decrease in migraine 
and TTH). The bulk of burden due to headache occurred in the 30-49 year age 
group, with a peak at ages 35-44 years. The age-standardised YLD rates of both 
headache disorders were higher in women with female to male ratio of 1.69 for 
migraine and 1.38 for TTH. All countries of the EMR except for Somalia and 
Djibouti had higher age-standardised YLD rates for migraine and TTH in compare 
to the global rates. Libya and Saudi Arabia had the highest increase in 
age-standardised YLD rates of migraine and TTH, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that primary headache disorders are 
a major and a growing cause of disability in EMR. Since 1990, burden of primary 
headache disorders has constantly been higher in EMR compared to rest of the 
world, which indicates that health systems in EMR must focus further on 
developing and implementing preventive and management strategies to control 
headache.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents with DMD treated with chronic high dose GC therapy 
typically have profound pubertal delay. Testosterone, the main circulating 
androgen in men, promotes virilisation and growth with associated accrual of 
fat-free muscle mass and bone mineral content. Testosterone therapy is routinely 
used to mimic the normal stages of pubertal development in patients with 
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, androgen deficiency secondary to testicular 
disease and in constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP). Improved life 
expectancy in DMD has meant that more adolescents are eligible for testosterone 
supplementation but there is little objective data regarding the impact of this 
treatment on muscle structure and function, bone integrity and overall 
well-being.
METHODS: This is a single centre observational clinical trial (NCT02571205) that 
aims to follow the progress of 15 adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
and delayed puberty as they are managed with incremental testosterone therapy to 
induce puberty. Subjects will all be treated with a steadily increasing dose of 
testosterone administered by injection every 4 weeks and data will be collected 
to help us determine the effectiveness and tolerability of the described 
treatment regimen. We will use the data to explore the effects of testosterone 
on pubertal development, growth, muscle strength and function, bone mineral 
density, body composition with a detailed record of any adverse events. We will 
also carry out interviews to explore the boys' views on the tolerability of the 
regimen. The study will last for 27 months in total for each participant.
DISCUSSION: Our experience has indicated that testosterone treatment in 
adolescents with DMD is liked and well tolerated but we have not collected 
objective data on a specific treatment regimen and there is no current 
consensus. Testosterone supplementation is not part of the standard of care of 
pubertal delay in DMD but inclusion in future protocols may be appropriate 
depending on the results of this trial.
