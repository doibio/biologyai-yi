BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, and the 
fourth most common cause of cancer death. Of those people successfully treated 
with first-line chemotherapy, 55-75% will relapse within 2 years. At this time, 
it is uncertain which chemotherapy regimen is more clinically effective and 
cost-effective for the treatment of recurrent, advanced ovarian cancer.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the comparative clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of topotecan (Hycamtin(®), GlaxoSmithKline), pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLDH; Caelyx(®), Schering-Plough), 
paclitaxel (Taxol(®), Bristol-Myers Squibb), trabectedin (Yondelis(®), 
PharmaMar) and gemcitabine (Gemzar(®), Eli Lilly and Company) for the treatment 
of advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (MEDLINE(®), EMBASE, Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment database, NHS 
Economic Evaluations Database) and trial registries were searched, and company 
submissions were reviewed. Databases were searched from inception to May 2013.
METHODS: A systematic review of the clinical and economic literature was carried 
out following standard methodological principles. Double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled trials, evaluating topotecan, PLDH, paclitaxel, trabectedin 
and gemcitabine, and economic evaluations were included. A network meta-analysis 
(NMA) was carried out. A de novo economic model was developed.
RESULTS: For most outcomes measuring clinical response, two networks were 
constructed: one evaluating platinum-based regimens and one evaluating 
non-platinum-based regimens. In people with platinum-sensitive disease, NMA 
found statistically significant benefits for PLDH plus platinum, and paclitaxel 
plus platinum for overall survival (OS) compared with platinum monotherapy. PLDH 
plus platinum significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared 
with paclitaxel plus platinum. Of the non-platinum-based treatments, PLDH 
monotherapy and trabectedin plus PLDH were found to significantly increase OS, 
but not PFS, compared with topotecan monotherapy. In people with 
platinum-resistant/-refractory (PRR) disease, NMA found no statistically 
significant differences for any treatment compared with alternative regimens in 
OS and PFS. Economic modelling indicated that, for people with 
platinum-sensitive disease and receiving platinum-based therapy, the estimated 
probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER; incremental cost per 
additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)] for paclitaxel plus platinum 
compared with platinum was £24,539. Gemcitabine plus carboplatin was extendedly 
dominated, and PLDH plus platinum was strictly dominated. For people with 
platinum-sensitive disease and receiving non-platinum-based therapy, the 
probabilistic ICERs associated with PLDH compared with paclitaxel, and 
trabectedin plus PLDH compared with PLDH, were estimated to be £25,931 and 
£81,353, respectively. Topotecan was strictly dominated. For people with PRR 
disease, the probabilistic ICER associated with topotecan compared with PLDH was 
estimated to be £324,188. Paclitaxel was strictly dominated.
LIMITATIONS: As platinum- and non-platinum-based treatments were evaluated 
separately, the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
these regimens is uncertain in patients with platinum-sensitive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: For platinum-sensitive disease, it was not possible to compare the 
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of platinum-based therapies with 
non-platinum-based therapies. For people with platinum-sensitive disease and 
treated with platinum-based therapies, paclitaxel plus platinum could be 
considered cost-effective compared with platinum at a threshold of £30,000 per 
additional QALY. For people with platinum-sensitive disease and treated with 
non-platinum-based therapies, it is unclear whether PLDH would be considered 
cost-effective compared with paclitaxel at a threshold of £30,000 per additional 
QALY; trabectedin plus PLDH is unlikely to be considered cost-effective compared 
with PLDH. For patients with PRR disease, it is unlikely that topotecan would be 
considered cost-effective compared with PLDH. Randomised controlled trials 
comparing platinum with non-platinum-based treatments might help to verify the 
comparative effectiveness of these regimens.

BACKGROUND: Due to their complexity and risks, mesenteric-portal axis resection 
and reconstruction during the pancreatectomy procedure were not recommended back 
in the early nineties. However, as per technical improvements and the reduction 
in morbidity and mortality rates, they have been routinely indicated in large 
medical centers.
AIM: To show results from cases of patients subjected to mesenteric-portal axis 
resection during pancreatectomy.
METHOD: Patients subjected to mesenteric-portal axis resection during 
pancreatectomy were prospectively and consecutively assessed. The procedure was 
indicated according to anatomical criteria defined by imaging exams or 
intraoperative assessment.
RESULTS: Ten patients, half of them were male, with mean age of 55.7 years 
(40-76) were included. The most frequent underlying diseases were pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma and Frantz tumor. The circumferential resection of the portal 
vein associated with the superior mesenteric vein with splenic vein ligature (4 
cases=40%) and the primary anastomosis of the vascular stumps (5 cases=50%) 
were, respectively, the most performed types of vascular resection and 
reconstruction. Surgery time ranged from 480 to 600 minutes (average=556 
minutes) and postoperative hospitalization time ranged from 9 to 114 days 
(average=34.8 days). Morbidity rate was 60%, and clinical pancreatic fistula 
(grade B and C) was the most common complication (3 cases=30%). Mortality rate 
was 10% (1 case).
CONCLUSION: Mesenteric-portal axis resection is a valid technical procedure. It 
should be taken into account after a clinical assessment that included not only 
the patients' clinical condition but also the technical and anatomical 
conditions of the mesenteric-portal axis tumor infiltration as well as life 
expectancy based on the patient's cancer prognosis.

RACIONAL: Devido à complexidade e riscos, a ressecção e reconstrução do eixo 
mesentéricoportal durante pancreatectomia até o início dos anos noventa não era 
recomendada. Entretanto, com o aprimoramento técnico e redução da 
morbimortalidade ela tem sido indicada de forma rotineira nos grandes centros.
OBJETIVO: Demostrar os resultados de uma série de casos submetida à ressecção do 
eixo mesentérico-portal durante a pancreatectomia.
MÉTODO: Foram avaliados prospectivamente e consecutivamente pacientes submetidos 
à ressecção do eixo mesentéricoportal durante pancreatectomias. A indicação do 
procedimento baseou-se em critérios anatômicos definidos por exames de imagem ou 
por avaliação intra-operatória.
RESULTADOS: Foram incluídos 10 pacientes, metade do sexo masculino, com idade 
média de 55,7 anos (40-76). As doenças de base mais frequentes foram o 
adenocarcinoma de pâncreas e o tumor de Frantz. O tipo de ressecção e 
reconstrução vascular mais realizado foi respectivamente a ressecção 
circunferencial da veia porta associada à veia mesentérica superior com ligadura 
da veia esplênica (4 casos=40%) e a anastomose primária dos cotos vasculares (5 
casos=50%). O tempo operatório variou entre 480 e 600 minutos (média=556 
minutos) e o tempo de internação pós-operatória variou de 9 a 114 dias 
(média=34,8 dias). A morbidade foi de 60%, sendo a fístula pancreática clínica 
(grau B e C) a complicação mais frequente (3 casos=30%). A mortalidade foi de 
10% (um caso).
CONCLUSÃO: A ressecção do eixo mesentérico-portal é artifício técnico válido. 
Deve ser considerada após consideração que contemple não apenas as condições 
clínicas dos pacientes, as condições técnicas e anatômicas da infiltração 
tumoral do eixo mesentérico-portal, mais também, e de forma não menos 
importante, a expectativa de sobrevida com base no prognóstico oncológico do 
paciente.

Incidence and survival rates are commonly reported statistics, but these may 
fail to capture the full impact of childhood cancers. We describe the years of 
potential life lost (YPLL) and years of life lived with disease (YLLD) in 
children and adolescents who died of cancer in the United States to estimate the 
impact of childhood cancer in the United States in 2009. We examined mortality 
data in 2009 among children and adolescents <20 years old in both the National 
Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) datasets. YPLL and YLLD were calculated for all deaths due to 
cancer. Histology-specific YPLL and YLLD of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, 
leukemia, and lymphoma were estimated using SEER. There were 2233 deaths and 
153,390.4 YPLL due to neoplasm in 2009. CNS tumors were the largest cause of 
YPLL (31%) among deaths due to cancer and were the cause of 1.4% of YPLL due to 
all causes. For specific histologies, the greatest mean YPLL per death was due 
to atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (78.0 years lost). The histology with the 
highest mean YLLD per death in children and adolescents who died of cancer was 
primitive neuroectodermal tumor (4.6 years lived). CNS tumors are the most 
common solid malignancy in individuals <20 years old and have the highest YPLL 
cost of all cancers. This offers the first histology-specific description of 
YPLL in children and adolescents and proposes a new measure of cancer impact, 
YLLD, in individuals who die of their disease. YPLL and YLLD complement 
traditional indicators of mortality and help place CNS tumors in the context of 
other childhood malignancies.

Medicine, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Obesity is a major public health problem, is associated with increased rates of 
mortality risk and of developing several comorbidities, and lessens life 
expectancy. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbidly obese 
patients, reducing risk of developing new comorbidities, health care utilization 
and mortality. The establishment of centers of excellence with interdisciplinary 
staff in bariatric surgery has been reducing operative mortality in the course 
of time, improving surgical safety and quality. The endocrinologist is part of 
the interdisciplinary team. The aim of this review is to provide 
endocrinologists, physicians and health care providers crucial elements of good 
clinical practice in the management of morbidly obese bariatric surgical 
candidates. This information includes formal indications and contraindications 
for bariatric operations, description of usual bariatric and metabolic 
operations as well as endoscopic treatments, preoperative assessments including 
psychological, metabolic and cardiorespiratory evaluation and postoperative 
dietary staged meal progression and nutritional supplementation follow-up with 
micronutrient deficiencies monitoring, surgical complications, suspension of 
medications in type 2 diabetic patients, dumping syndrome and hypoglycemia.

Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.

OBJECTIVE: Fear of childbirth is a common reason for seeking cesarean section. 
It is important to consider outcomes and costs associated with alternative 
treatment and delivery mode. We compared well-being and costs of group 
psychoeducation and conventional care for fear of childbirth.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
POPULATION: A total of 371 nulliparous women scoring over the 95th centile in 
the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ) during the first trimester.
SETTING: Finland, data from obstetrical patient records and questionnaires.
METHODS: Randomization to group psychoeducation with relaxation (six sessions 
during pregnancy, one after childbirth, n = 131), or surveillance and referral 
on demand (n = 240).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All costs in maternity care during pregnancy, delivery 
and postnatally according to Diagnoses Related Groups. Life satisfaction and 
general well-being 3 months after childbirth (by a Satisfaction with Life Scale 
and Well-being Visual Analogue Scale).
RESULTS: The groups did not differ in total direct costs (€3786/woman in 
psychoeducative group and €3830/woman in control group), nor in life 
satisfaction or general well-being. Although only 76 (30%) of the women assigned 
to the surveillance were referred to special maternity care and 36 (15%) 
attended advanced prenatal classes, costs in the psychoeducation group did not 
exceed the costs of the controls, mostly because of the greater number of 
uncomplicated vaginal deliveries (63% vs. 47%, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Through an association with safer childbirth and equal well-being 
after delivery, psychoeducative group treatment for nulliparous women with fear 
of childbirth can be a recommended choice for the same overall costs as 
conventional treatment.

BACKGROUND: The predictive value and improved risk classification of 
self-reported cardiorespiratory fitness (SRCF), when added to traditional risk 
factors on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and longevity, are unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 3843 males and 5093 females from the Copenhagen 
City Heart Study without CVD in 1991-1994 were analyzed using multivariate Cox 
hazards regression to assess the predictive value and survival benefit for CVD 
and all-cause mortality from SRCF. The category-free net reclassification 
improvement from SRCF was calculated at 15-year follow-up on CVD and all-cause 
mortality. Overall, 1693 individuals died from CVD. In the fully adjusted Cox 
model, those reporting the same (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.32) and lower (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.24) SRCF 
than peers had an increased risk of CVD mortality, compared with individuals 
with higher SRCF. Compared with individuals with higher SRCF, those with the 
same and lower SRCF had 1.8 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.5) and 5.1 (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.2) 
years lower life expectancy, respectively. Individuals with lower SRCF had a 
significantly increased risk of CVD mortality, compared with individuals with 
higher SRCF, within each strata of leisure time physical activity and self-rated 
health, and SRCF significantly predicted CVD mortality independently of 
self-rated health and walking pace. A net reclassification improvement of 30.5% 
(95% CI, 22.1% to 38.9%) for CVD mortality was found when adding SRCF to 
traditional risk factors. Comparable findings were found for all-cause 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: SRCF has independent predictive value, is related to a considerable 
survival benefit, and improves risk classification when added to traditional 
risk factors of CVD and all-cause mortality. SRCF might prove useful in improved 
risk stratification in primary prevention.

Echo-based screening of rheumatic heart disease in children: a 
cost-effectiveness Markov model.

OBJECTIVES: To project the cost-effectiveness of population-based echo screening 
to prevent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) consequences.
BACKGROUND: RHD is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity 
during adolescence and young adulthood in low- and middle-per capita income 
settings. Echocardiography-based screening approaches can dramatically expand 
the number of children identified at risk of progressive RHD. Cost-effectiveness 
analysis can inform public health agencies and payers about the net economic 
benefit of such large-scale population-based screening.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed comparing a no-screen to echo screen 
approach. The echo screen program was modeled as a 2-staged screen of a cohort 
of 11-year-old children with initial short screening performed by dedicated 
technicians and follow-up complete echo by cardiologists. Penicillin RHD 
prophylaxis was modeled to only reduce rheumatic fever recurrence-related 
exacerbation. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and societal costs (in 2010 
Australian dollars) associated with each approach were estimated. One-way, 
two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on RHD prevalence 
and transition probabilities; echocardiography test characteristics; and 
societal level costs including supplies, transportation, and labor.
RESULTS: The incremental costs and QALYs of the screen compared to no screen 
strategy were -$432 (95% CI = -$1357 to $575) and 0.007 (95% CI = -0.0101 to 
0.0237), respectively. The joint probability that the screen was both less 
costly and more effective exceeded 80%. Sensitivity analyses suggested screen 
strategy dominance depends mostly on the probability of transitioning out of 
sub-clinical RHD.
CONCLUSION: Two-stage echo RHD screening and secondary prophylaxis may achieve 
modestly improved outcomes at lower cost compared to clinical detection and 
deserves closer attention from health policy stakeholders.

Population and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of British 
Columbia , Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term costs per sustained remission and 
sustained response of three tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (infliximab, 
adalimumab, and golimumab) in comparison to conventional therapy for the 
treatment of moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was developed. This included an 8-week 
induction period, and 22 subsequent 2-week cycles (up to 1 year). The model 
included three disease states: remission, response, and relapse. Costs were from 
a Canadian public payer perspective. Estimates for the additional cost per 1 
year of sustained remission and sustained response were obtained.
RESULTS: Golimumab 100 mg provided the lowest cost per additional remission 
($935) and cost per additional response ($701) compared with conventional 
therapy. Golimumab 50 mg yielded slightly higher costs than golimumab 100 mg. 
Infliximab was associated with the largest additional number of estimated 
remissions and responses, but also higher cost at $1975 per remission and $1311 
per response. Adalimumab was associated with the largest cost per remission 
($7430) and cost per response ($2361). The cost per additional remission and 
cost per additional response associated with infliximab vs golimumab 100 mg was 
$14,659 and $4753, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the additional cost of 1 full year of 
remission and response are lowest with golimumab 100 mg, followed by golimumab 
50 mg. Although infliximab has the highest efficacy, it did not exhibit the 
lowest cost per additional remission or response. Adalimumab produced the 
highest cost per additional remission and response.

BACKGROUND: On the basis of the 2014 guidelines for hypertension therapy in the 
United States, many eligible adults remain untreated. We projected the 
cost-effectiveness of treating hypertension in U.S. adults according to the 2014 
guidelines.
METHODS: We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to simulate 
drug-treatment and monitoring costs, costs averted for the treatment of 
cardiovascular disease, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by 
treating previously untreated adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years from 
2014 through 2024. We assessed cost-effectiveness according to age, hypertension 
level, and the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease or diabetes.
RESULTS: The full implementation of the new hypertension guidelines would result 
in approximately 56,000 fewer cardiovascular events and 13,000 fewer deaths from 
cardiovascular causes annually, which would result in overall cost savings. The 
projections showed that the treatment of patients with existing cardiovascular 
disease or stage 2 hypertension would save lives and costs for men between the 
ages of 35 and 74 years and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years. The 
treatment of men or women with existing cardiovascular disease or men with stage 
2 hypertension but without cardiovascular disease would remain cost-saving even 
if strategies to increase medication adherence doubled treatment costs. The 
treatment of stage 1 hypertension was cost-effective (defined as <$50,000 per 
QALY) for all men and for women between the ages of 45 and 74 years, whereas 
treating women between the ages of 35 and 44 years with stage 1 hypertension but 
without cardiovascular disease had intermediate or low cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the 2014 hypertension guidelines for U.S. 
adults between the ages of 35 and 74 years could potentially prevent about 
56,000 cardiovascular events and 13,000 deaths annually, while saving costs. 
Controlling hypertension in all patients with cardiovascular disease or stage 2 
hypertension could be effective and cost-saving. (Funded by the National Heart,

The societal need for new central nervous system (CNS) medicines is substantial, 
because of the global increase in life expectancy and the accompanying increase 
in age-related CNS diseases. Low blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been 
one of the major causes of failure for new CNS drug candidates. There has 
therefore been a great interest in cell models, which mimic BBB permeation 
properties. In this review, we present an overview of the performance of 
monocultured, cocultured, and triple-cultured primary cells and immortalized 
cell lines, including key parameters such as transendothelial electrical 
resistance values, permeabilities of paracellular flux markers, and expression 
of BBB-specific marker proteins. Microfluidic systems are gaining ground as a 
new automated technical platform for cell culture and systematic analysis. The 
performance of these systems was compared with current state-of-the-art models 
and it was noted that, although they show great promise, these systems have not 
yet reached beyond the proof-of-concept stage. In general, it was found that 
there were large variations in experimental protocols, BBB phenotype markers, 
and paracellular flux markers used. It is the author's opinion that the field 
may benefit greatly from developing standardized methodologies and initiating 
collaborative efforts on optimizing culture protocols.

PURPOSE: A cost-utility analysis of botulinum toxin type A products for the 
treatment of cervical dystonia (CD) was conducted.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of botulinum toxin type A products was 
conducted from the U.S. government perspective using a decision-analysis model 
with a one-year time horizon. Probabilities of the model were taken from several 
studies using the three botulinum type A products approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of CD: onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), 
abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport), and incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin). The main outcome 
measurement was successful treatment response with botulinum toxin type A, 
measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Response was defined as a 
patient who experienced improvement of CD symptoms without a severe adverse 
event. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to test robustness of 
the base-case results.
RESULTS: All three botulinum toxin type A agents were cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Xeomin was the most 
cost-effective with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,548 per QALY. Xeomin was 
dominant over the alternative agents with equivalent efficacy outcomes and lower 
costs. Dysport had the second lowest cost-effectiveness ratio ($36,678), 
followed by Botox ($49,337). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis supported 
the results of the base-case analysis. Dysport was associated with the lowest 
wastage (2.2%), followed by Xeomin (10%) and Botox (22.9%).
CONCLUSION: A cost-utility analysis found that Xeomin was the more 
cost-effective botulinum toxin type A product compared with Botox and Dysport 
for the treatment of CD. Wastage associated with the respective products may 
have a large effect on the cost-effectiveness of the agents.

According to the European Union Tissues and Cells Directives donation of tissue 
is contraindicated in the presence of or a previous history of malignant 
disease, with the exception of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer is 
the most common cancer. Due to ultraviolet light exposure and increasing life 
expectancy an increasing prevalence of malignant or premalignant skin lesions is 
observed, which may result in a decline of the availability of skin for 
transplantation. A risk assessment based on published studies and expert opinion 
was performed in order to investigate the risk of transmitting malignant or 
premalignant skin lesions through tissue transplantation, and more particular 
through skin transplantation. The scarcity of data concerning cancer 
transmission in tissue transplantation was challenging. Circumstantial evidence, 
available for organ transplantation, was used to develop the following policy 
proposal for skin transplantation and cutaneous tumours. Malignant melanoma is 
an absolute contraindication for the donation of skin and also of other tissues, 
whereas, non-lesional skin and other tissues of a donor with non-melanoma skin 
cancer (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) or with a premalignant skin 
lesion can be considered for transplantation. The above mentioned protocol 
proposal might serve as a prototype for analogous protocols for non-cutaneous 
malignancies.

Hospital, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119074. Guohao_chang@nuhs.edu.sg.

Age-related degenerative calcification is currently the most common cause of 
aortic stenosis (AS) in adults and the most frequent reason for aortic valve 
replacement in patients with AS. With the increased life expectancy, a large 
proportion of elderly patients with AS is undergoing cardiac surgery, although 
many are not offered conventional aortic valve replacement due to the risks 
involved. However, sutureless aortic valve replacement provides an alternative 
for this group of elderly patients. This case series reports the first 
experience in Asia of sutureless aortic valve implantation in seven patients at 
our institution.

We explored the overall impact of foodborne disease caused by seven leading 
foodborne pathogens in the United States using the disability adjusted life year 
(DALY). We defined health states for each pathogen (acute illness and sequelae) 
and estimated the average annual incidence of each health state using data from 
public health surveillance and previously published estimates from studies in 
the United States, Canada and Europe. These pathogens caused about 112 000 DALYs 
annually due to foodborne illnesses acquired in the United States. Non-typhoidal 
Salmonella (32 900) and Toxoplasma (32 700) caused the most DALYs, followed by 
Campylobacter (22 500), norovirus (9900), Listeria monocytogenes (8800), 
Clostridium perfringens (4000), and Escherichia coli O157 (1200). These 
estimates can be used to prioritize food safety interventions. Future estimates 
of the burden of foodborne disease in DALYs would be improved by addressing 
important data gaps and by the development and validation of US-specific 
disability weights for foodborne diseases.

BACKGROUND: Liver biopsy is the reference standard for diagnosing the extent of 
fibrosis in chronic liver disease; however, it is invasive, with the potential 
for serious complications. Alternatives to biopsy include non-invasive liver 
tests (NILTs); however, the cost-effectiveness of these needs to be established.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of NILTs in 
patients with chronic liver disease.
DATA SOURCES: We searched various databases from 1998 to April 2012, recent 
conference proceedings and reference lists.
METHODS: We included studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of NILTs 
using liver biopsy as the reference standard. Diagnostic studies were assessed 
using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. 
Meta-analysis was conducted using the bivariate random-effects model with 
correlation between sensitivity and specificity (whenever possible). Decision 
models were used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the NILTs. Expected costs 
were estimated using a NHS perspective and health outcomes were measured as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Markov models were developed to estimate 
long-term costs and QALYs following testing, and antiviral treatment where 
indicated, for chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C (HCV). NILTs 
were compared with each other, sequential testing strategies, biopsy and 
strategies including no testing. For alcoholic liver disease (ALD), we assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of NILTs in the context of potentially increasing 
abstinence from alcohol. Owing to a lack of data and treatments specifically for 
fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the 
analysis was limited to an incremental cost per correct diagnosis. An analysis 
of NILTs to identify patients with cirrhosis for increased monitoring was also 
conducted.
RESULTS: Given a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY, treating 
everyone with HCV without prior testing was cost-effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £9204. This was robust in most sensitivity 
analyses but sensitive to the extent of treatment benefit for patients with mild 
fibrosis. For HBV [hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative)] this strategy had an 
ICER of £28,137, which was cost-effective only if the upper bound of the 
standard UK cost-effectiveness threshold range (£30,000) is acceptable. For 
HBeAg-positive disease, two NILTs applied sequentially (hyaluronic acid and 
magnetic resonance elastography) were cost-effective at a £20,000 threshold 
(ICER: £19,612); however, the results were highly uncertain, with several test 
strategies having similar expected outcomes and costs. For patients with ALD, 
liver biopsy was the cost-effective strategy, with an ICER of £822.
LIMITATIONS: A substantial number of tests had only one study from which 
diagnostic accuracy was derived; therefore, there is a high risk of bias. Most 
NILTs did not have validated cut-offs for diagnosis of specific fibrosis stages. 
The findings of the ALD model were dependent on assuptions about abstinence 
rates assumptions and the modelling approach for NAFLD was hindered by the lack 
of evidence on clinically effective treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating everyone without NILTs is cost-effective for patients with 
HCV, but only for HBeAg-negative if the higher cost-effectiveness threshold is 
appropriate. For HBeAg-positive, two NILTs applied sequentially were 
cost-effective but highly uncertain. Further evidence for treatment 
effectiveness is required for ALD and NAFLD.

A theoretical and empirical review of psychological factors associated with 
falls-related psychological concerns in community-dwelling older people.

Psychology,UK.

Initiative,Australia.

BACKGROUND: Four constructs are encompassed by the term "falls-related 
psychological concerns" (FrPC); "fear of falling" (FOF), "falls-related 
self-efficacy" (FSe), "balance confidence" (BC) and "outcome expectancy" (OE). 
FrPC are associated with negative consequences including physical, 
psychological, and social. Identifying factors associated with FrPC could inform 
interventions to reduce these concerns.
METHODS: Sixty-two empirical papers relating to psychological factors associated 
with FrPC in community-dwelling older people (CDOP) were reviewed. Four levels 
of evidence were used when evaluating the literature: good, moderate, tentative, 
and none.
RESULTS: Evidence that anxiety predicted FOF, BC, and OE was tentative. Moderate 
evidence was found for anxiety predicting FSe. Good evidence was found for 
depression predicting FSe. Moderate evidence was found for depression predicting 
both FOF and BC. No evidence was found for depression predicting OE. Tentative 
evidence was found for FSe predicting depression. Good and moderate evidence was 
found for quality of life (QoL) being predicted by FOF and BC respectively. 
Tentative evidence was found for FSe predicting QoL. Moderate evidence was found 
for QoL predicting both FSe and BC. No evidence was found for QoL predicting 
FOF. Good and moderate evidence was found for activity avoidance/restriction 
(AA/AR) being predicted by FOF and FSe respectively. Tentative evidence was 
found for BC and OE predicting AA/AR, as well as for AA/AR predicting FOF. 
Moderate evidence for activity level (AL) predicting FOF was identified, however 
the evidence of this predicting FSe and BC was tentative. Evidence for FOF, FSe, 
and BC predicting AL was tentative as was evidence to suggest FOF predicted 
coping.
CONCLUSIONS: Mixed evidence has been found for the association of psychological 
factors in association with FrPCs. Future research should employ theoretically 
grounded concepts, use multivariate analysis and longitudinal designs.

BACKGROUND: Total hip replacement (THR) involves the replacement of a damaged 
hip joint with an artificial hip prosthesis. Resurfacing arthroplasty (RS) 
involves replacement of the joint surface of the femoral head with a metal 
surface covering.
OBJECTIVES: To undertake clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis 
of different types of THR and RS for the treatment of pain and disability in 
people with end-stage arthritis of the hip, in particular to compare the 
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of (1) different types of primary 
THR and RS for people in whom both procedures are suitable and (2) different 
types of primary THR for people who are not suitable for hip RS.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane 
Library, Current Controlled Trials and UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN) 
Portfolio Database were searched in December 2012, with searches limited to 
publications from 2008 and sample sizes of ≥ 100 participants. Reference lists 
and websites of manufacturers and professional organisations were also screened.
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews of the literature were undertaken to appraise 
the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different types of THR and 
RS for people with end-stage arthritis of the hip. Included randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews were data extracted and risk of 
bias and methodological quality were independently assessed by two reviewers 
using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool and the Assessment of 
Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. A Markov multistate model was 
developed for the economic evaluation of the technologies. Sensitivity analyses 
stratified by sex and controlled for age were carried out to assess the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: A total of 2469 records were screened of which 37 were included, 
representing 16 RCTs and eight systematic reviews. The mean post-THR Harris Hip 
Score measured at different follow-up times (from 6 months to 10 years) did not 
differ between THR groups, including between cross-linked polyethylene and 
traditional polyethylene cup liners (pooled mean difference 2.29, 95% confidence 
interval -0.88 to 5.45). Five systematic reviews reported evidence on different 
types of THR (cemented vs. cementless cup fixation and implant articulation 
materials) but these reviews were inconclusive. Eleven cost-effectiveness 
studies were included; four provided relevant cost and utility data for the 
model. Thirty registry studies were included, with no studies reporting better 
implant survival for RS than for all types of THR. For all analyses, mean costs 
for RS were higher than those for THR and mean quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were lower. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for RS was 
dominated by THR, that is, THR was cheaper and more effective than RS (for a 
lifetime horizon in the base-case analysis, the incremental cost of RS was 
£11,284 and the incremental QALYs were -0.0879). For all age and sex groups RS 
remained clearly dominated by THR. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves 
showed that, for all patients, THR was almost 100% cost-effective at any 
willingness-to-pay level. There were age and sex differences in the populations 
with different types of THR and variations in revision rates (from 1.6% to 3.5% 
at 9 years). For the base-case analysis, for all age and sex groups and a 
lifetime horizon, mean costs for category E (cemented components with a 
polyethylene-on-ceramic articulation) were slightly lower and mean QALYs for 
category E were slightly higher than those for all other THR categories in both 
deterministic and probabilistic analyses. Hence, category E dominated the other 
four categories. Sensitivity analysis using an age- and sex-adjusted log-normal 
model demonstrated that, over a lifetime horizon and at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of £20,000 per QALY, categories A and E were equally likely (50%) to 
be cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: A large proportion of the included studies were inconclusive 
because of poor reporting, missing data, inconsistent results and/or great 
uncertainty in the treatment effect estimates. This warrants cautious 
interpretation of the findings. The evidence on complications was scarce, which 
may be because of the absence or rarity of these events or because of 
under-reporting. The poor reporting meant that it was not possible to explore 
contextual factors that might have influenced study results and also reduced the 
applicability of the findings to routine clinical practice in the UK. The scope 
of the review was limited to evidence published in English in 2008 or later, 
which could be interpreted as a weakness; however, systematic reviews would 
provide summary evidence for studies published before 2008.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with THR, revision rates for RS were higher, mean costs 
for RS were higher and mean QALYs gained were lower; RS was dominated by THR. 
Similar results were obtained in the deterministic and probabilistic analyses 
and for all age and sex groups THR was almost 100% cost-effective at any 
willingness-to-pay level. Revision rates for all types of THR were low. Category 
A THR (cemented components with a polyethylene-on-metal articulation) was more 
cost-effective for older age groups. However, across all age-sex groups 
combined, the mean cost for category E THR (cemented components with a 
polyethylene-on-ceramic articulation) was slightly lower and the mean QALYs 
gained were slightly higher. Category E therefore dominated the other four 
categories. Certain types of THR appeared to confer some benefit, including 
larger femoral head sizes, use of a cemented cup, use of a cross-linked 
polyethylene cup liner and a ceramic-on-ceramic as opposed to a 
metal-on-polyethylene articulation. Further RCTs with long-term follow-up are 
needed.

Cost-effectiveness of powered mobility devices for elderly people with 
disability.

Author information:
(1)a School of Health and Medical Sciences, Örebro University , Örebro , Sweden.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of 
prescribing powered mobility devices (PMDs) to elderly users.
METHODS: Forty-five persons participated in the pre- and post-intervention study 
with a follow-up at four months. All participants were prescribed a scooter 
model and were offered individual support to get started using the PMD. In the 
analysis, the use of the PMD was compared to the situation prior to its use. The 
cost-utility analysis takes a societal perspective and considers costs, savings 
and quality of life (QoL) using answers to the EQ-5D questionnaire.
RESULTS: Costs for the first year with the PMD were 1395 USD and then 592 USD 
per subsequent year. There was a significant decrease in transportation costs 
and in relatives' time use, but the increase in QoL of 0.041 was not 
significant. Costs per gained quality adjusted life year (QALY) were 
12 400-14 700 USD/QALY if the value of time saved not was considered and 
600-2900 USD/QALY when an hour was valued at 3.6 USD.
CONCLUSION: Prescription of PMDs to elderly users might be cost-effective. 
However, there are shortcomings in measuring QALY gains from the use of a PMD, 
and it is unclear how time savings among relatives should be valued. 
Implications for Rehabilitation Prescription of powered mobility devices for the 
elderly with disability seems to be cost effective and should be a standard 
intervention. In economic evaluations of powered mobility devices and other 
assistive devices, the commonly used analyses methods are not always appropriate 
and therefore need to be adjusted.

The effect of maternal exposure to psychosocial job strain on pregnancy outcomes 
and child development.

Psychological stress at work is a rising problem in Denmark. Nearly one third of 
the women reported in 2005 that they had difficulties completing their work 
tasks, and 17 % found that they had only limited or no influence on their work 
tasks. The corresponding numbers for 1987 were 18.3 % and 16 %, respectively. 
Work-related stress shortens the life expectancy and reduces the number of years 
without prolonged disease. For the society work-related stress amounts to more 
than 30,000 hospital admissions each year, half a million extra days on 
sick-leave for women, 500,000 contacts to general practitioners, 1600 early 
retirements for women, and an overuse of the health-care system. With the second 
highest employment rate in Europe for women - and many of them in the 
childbearing age - effects of psychological stress at work may extend beyond the 
exposed individual and affect pregnancy, birth and health of the child. Few 
studies on job stress relative to pregnancy have been carried out, but both 
animal and epidemiological studies have shown effect of exposure to stressful 
conditions during pregnancy and adverse effects on the offspring. The specific 
aims for the three studies included in this thesis were to investigate the 
association between maternal psychosocial job strain during pregnancy, measured 
as high demands and low control and the risk of: - Having a child born preterm 
or with low or high birth weight relative to gestational week (paper I + II) - 
Congenital malformations in offspring (paper III) - Asthma and atopic dermatitis 
in the children (paper IV). Furthermore, it was also the ambition to maximize 
and secure the quality of research and integrity of the data used by documenting 
the methods in a protocol that described the analyses before they were done and 
to keep transparency in the methods used following good epidemiological 
practices (GEP) for occupational and environmental epidemiological research. All 
analyses in this thesis are based on information and data from the Danish 
National Birth Cohort (DNBC). The cohort was established in 1994 and baseline 
information from the enrolled 100,418 pregnancies was gathered from 1996 to 
2002. At their first antenatal visit pregnant women were invited to participate 
in the cohort by their general practitioner. To contribute the women had to be 
pregnant, have intentions of carrying the pregnancy to term, reside in Denmark 
and speak Danish sufficiently well to participate in telephone interviews. When 
enrolled the women were asked to participate in two telephone interviews during 
pregnancy at approximately 12-14 and 30-32 weeks of gestation and two after 
birth when the child was six and 18 months old and a follow-up questionnaire at 
age seven years.  Exposure to work-related stress was assessed based on 
information from the first interview on two questions regarding job control and 
job demands. These questions were interpreted as dimensions of demands and 
control, and hereafter used as a proxy for the dimensions of the job strain 
model by Karasek.  Based on their answers, the women were divided into the four 
job strain categories: high strain, active, passive and low strain. Gestational 
age at birth, birthweight and congenital malformations were extracted from the 
Danish Medical Birth Register. The outcome variable on asthma and atopic 
dermatitis were based on maternal self-reports from the fourth (child 18 months) 
and fifth (child seven years old) interviews/questionnaires. All studies in the 
thesis were based on protocols describing methods, analyses etc. prior to
