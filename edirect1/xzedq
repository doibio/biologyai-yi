differences in the age progression of mortality between counties, but there were 
significant spatial differences in the level of mortality. The mortality level 
showed a relationship with socioeconomic and health care indicators with the 
expected sign, but with different strengths.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 resulted in a decline 
in life expectancy in Hungary not seen since World War II. The study highlights 
the importance of healthcare in addition to social vulnerability. It also points 
out that understanding age patterns will help to mitigate the consequences of 
the epidemic. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(17): 643-650.

Publisher: Bevezetés: A legtöbb országban a COVID–19-mortalitás az életkor 
előrehaladtával exponenciálisan nő, de a növekedési ráta országonként jelentősen 
eltér. A halálozás eltérő progressziója utalhat a népesség egészségi 
állapotának, az egészségügyi-kórházi ellátás színvonalának, valamint a kódolási 
gyakorlatnak a különbségére. Célkitűzés: Tanulmányunkban azt vizsgáltuk, hogy a 
pandémia második évében a COVID–19-halandóság életkor-specifikus megyei 
jellemzői között milyen természetű különbségek fedezhetők fel. Módszer: A 
COVID–19-mortalitás felnőtt életkori mintázatát megyénként, nemek szerint 
külön-külön Gompertz-függvénnyel, többszintű modellek segítségével becsültük. 
Eredmények: Eredményeink azt mutatták, hogy a Gompertz-függvény alkalmas a 
COVID–19-halandóság megyei mintázatainak leírására. A mortalitás életkori 
progressziójában nem, a szintjében azonban jelentős területi különbségeket 
találtunk. A mortalitás szintje a várakozásnak megfelelő előjelű, de eltérő 
erősségű kapcsolatot mutatott a társadalmi-gazdasági tényezők és az egészségügyi 
ellátás indikátoraival. Megbeszélés és következtetés: A COVID–19-pandémia 
2021-ben a várható élettartamnak a második világháború óta nem tapasztalt drámai 
visszaesését idézte elő Magyarországon. A tanulmány a társadalmi sérülékenység 
mellett az egészségügyi ellátás fontosságára hívja fel a figyelmet, továbbá 
rámutat arra, hogy az életkori mintázat megértése segít a járvány 
következményeinek mérséklésében. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(17): 643–650.

OBJECTIVES: Individual and societal willingness to pay (WTP) for end-of-life 
medical interventions continue to be subject to considerable uncertainty. This 
study aims at deriving both types of WTP estimates for an extension of survival 
time and an improvement of quality of life amounting to a QALY.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) involving a hypothetical novel drug 
for the treatment of terminal cancer involving 1529 Swiss residents was 
performed in 2014. In its individual setting, respondents choose between the 
status quo and a hypothetical drug with varying characteristics and 
out-of-pocket payments, adopting the perspective of a terminal cancer patient. 
In the societal setting, participants are asked to choose between the status quo 
and a social health insurance contract with and without coverage of the novel 
drug and a varying insurance contribution.
RESULTS: In the individual setting, respondents put a higher value on their 
quality of life than on their survival time whereas in the societal setting, 
they put a higher value on extra survival time. The combination of the two 
extensions results in a mean individual WTP per QALY of CHF 96,150 (1 CHF = 1 
USD as of 2014). Mean societal WTP for a QALY even amounts to CHF 213,500 in 
favor of an adult patient, CHF 255,600 for a child, and CHF 153,600 for a person 
aged over 70 years, respectively. While estimated societal values consistently 
exceed their individual counterparts, they vary considerably with respondents' 
socioeconomic characteristics in both settings.
CONCLUSIONS: This research finds that individual WTP for an extension of 
survival time to one year is dominated by WTP for health-related quality of life 
whereas for societal WTP, it is the other way round. Both individual and 
societal WTP values exhibit a great deal of heterogeneity, with the latter 
depending on the type of beneficiary.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the burden of acute COVID-19 in 
Córdoba, one of the most affected departments (states) in Colombia, through the 
estimation of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
METHODS: DALYs were estimated based on the number of cases of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection cases reported by official 
Colombian sources. A transition probability matrix among severity states was 
calculated using data obtained from a retrospective cohort that included 1736 
COVID-19 confirmed subjects living in Córdoba.
RESULTS: Córdoba had 120.23 deaths per 100 000 habitants during the study period 
(March 2020 to April 2021). Estimated total DALYs were 49 243 (2692 DALYs per 
100 000 inhabitants), mostly attributed to fatal cases (99.7%). On average, 25 
years of life were lost because of death by this infection. A relevant 
proportion of years of life lost because of COVID-19 (46.6%) was attributable to 
people < 60 years old and was greater in men. People ≥ 60 years old showed 
greater risk of progression to critical state than people between the age of 35 
and 60 years (hazard ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 2.5-12.5) and younger 
than 35 years (9.1; 95% confidence interval 4.0-20.6).
CONCLUSION: In Córdoba, premature mortality because of COVID-19 was 
substantially represented by people < 60 years old and was greater in males. Our 
data may be representative of Latin American populations with great infection 
spread during the first year of the pandemic and contribute to novel 
methodological aspects and parameter estimations that may be useful to measure 
COVID-19 burden in other countries of the region.

OBJETIVOS: Estimar la carga de COVID-19 aguda en Córdoba, uno de los 
departamentos (estados) más afectados de Colombia, a través de la estimación de 
años de vida ajustados por discapacidad (AVISAS).
MÉTODOS: Los AVISAS se estimaron con base en el número de casos de infección por 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reportados por fuentes oficiales 
colombianas. Se calculó una matriz de probabilidad de transición entre estados 
de gravedad a partir de los datos obtenidos de una cohorte retrospectiva que 
incluyó a 1.736 sujetos confirmados con COVID-19 residentes en Córdoba.
RESULTADOS: Córdoba tuvo 120,23 defunciones por cada 100.000 habitantes durante 
el periodo de estudio (marzo de 2020 a abril de 2021). Los AVISAS totales 
estimados fueron 49.243 (2.692 AV por 100.000 habitantes), en su mayoría 
atribuidos a los casos mortales (99,7%). En promedio, se perdieron 25 años de 
vida debido a las muertes secundarias a esta infección. Una proporción relevante 
de años de vida perdidos a causa de la COVID-19 (46,6%) fue atribuible a las 
personas menores de 60 años y fue mayor en los hombres. Las personas ≥ 60 años 
presentaron un mayor riesgo de progresión a estado crítico en comparación con 
las personas entre 35-60 años (hazard ratio 2,5; intervalo de confianza 95% 
2,5-12,5) y menores de 35 años (9,1; intervalo de confianza 95% 4,0-20,6).
CONCLUSIÓN: En Córdoba, la mortalidad prematura por COVID-19 estuvo 
sustancialmente representada por las personas menores de 60 años y fue mayor en 
el sexo masculino. Nuestros datos pueden ser representativos de poblaciones 
latinoamericanas con gran propagación de infecciones durante el primer año de la 
pandemia y aportan aspectos metodológicos novedosos para la estimación de 
parámetros que pueden ser útiles para medir la carga de COVID-19 en otros países 
de la región.

The epidemiological crisis of 2020-2021 has revealed a number of imbalances and 
"bottlenecks" that have developed in the Russian healthcare system over the past 
20 years as a result of a policy of limiting development to breakthroughs in 
individual areas accompanied by optimization of the sector. It became evident 
that one of the most acute problems is interregional disparity in terms of 
personnel and resource availability in the healthcare system, which determines 
the system's ability to respond to challenges and shocks. Solving these problems 
requires a comprehensive approach: simply increasing the sector's financing is 
not sufficient and must be accompanied by structural changes, in particular, 
modifying the education system and training new highly qualified personnel, 
creating an effective system of territorial distribution of personnel, and 
radically increasing the availability of high-end equipment, i.e., a transition 
to a new model of healthcare.

Superficial Venous Thrombosis of the Brachial Vein With Extension Into the 
Subclavian and Internal Jugular Veins, Secondary to a Routine Blood Draw.

Superficial thrombophlebitis, also known as superficial venous thrombosis, is an 
inflammatory condition involving the veins just below the surface of the skin 
secondary to clotted blood within that vein. The majority of cases are 
self-limited or resolve with a short course of anti-inflammatory medications and 
the application of warm compresses. Due to the self-limited nature of this 
disease process, clinically significant complications have rarely been 
described but are being seen more often in recent literature. This case report 
discusses an instance of superficial thrombophlebitis that occurred secondary to 
a routine blood draw and progressed to potentially life-threatening deep vein 
thrombosis. This case highlights the need for physicians to be aware of the 
potential complications of superficial thrombophlebitis and the importance of 
delivering strict return precautions to every patient with this condition.

The most common organic etiology of mitral regurgitation is degenerative and 
consists of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Volume overload because of mitral 
regurgitation is the most common complication of MVP. Advocating surgery before 
the consequences of volume overload become irreparable restores life expectancy, 
but carries a risk of mortality in patients who are often asymptomatic. On the 
other hand, the post-surgical outcome of symptomatic patients is dismal and life 
expectancy is impaired. In the present article, we aim to bridge the gap between 
these two therapeutic approaches, unifying the concepts of watchful waiting and 
early surgery in a "watchful surgery approach".

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third most lethal cancer in the 
United States, with a 5-year life expectancy of 11%. Most symptoms manifest at 
an advanced stage of the disease when surgery is no longer appropriate. The dire 
prognosis of PDAC warrants new strategies to improve the outcomes of patients, 
and early detection has garnered significant attention. However, early detection 
of PDAC is most often incidental, emphasizing the importance of developing new 
early detection screening strategies. Due to the low incidence of the disease in 
the general population, much of the focus for screening has turned to 
individuals at high risk of PDAC. This enriches the screening population and 
balances the risks associated with pancreas interventions. The cancers that are 
found in these high-risk individuals by MRI and/or EUS screening show favorable 
73% 5-year overall survival. Even with the emphasis on screening in enriched 
high-risk populations, only a minority of incident cancers are detected this 
way. One strategy to improve early detection outcomes is to integrate artificial 
intelligence (AI) into biomarker discovery and risk models. This expert review 
summarizes recent publications that have developed AI algorithms for the 
applications of risk stratification of PDAC using radiomics and electronic 
health records. Furthermore, this review illustrates the current uses of 
radiomics and biomarkers in AI for early detection of PDAC. Finally, various 
challenges and potential solutions are highlighted regarding the use of AI in 
medicine for early detection purposes.

BACKGROUND: Family caregivers make end-of-life (EOL) decisions for persons with 
severe dementia (PWSDs). It is not known whether the family caregivers' goals 
change over time.
OBJECTIVE: Assess caregivers' EOL care goal for PWSDs and change in these goals 
over time.
METHODS: Using a prospective cohort of 215 caregivers of PWSDs, we assessed the 
proportion of caregivers whose EOL care goal for PWSDs changed between two 
consecutive time points. Mixed effects multinomial regression models assessed 
factors associated with caregivers' EOL care goals for PWSD (maximal, moderate, 
minimal life extension); and change in EOL care goal from previous time point.
RESULTS: At baseline, 20% of the caregivers had a goal of maximal life extension 
for their PWSD, and 59% changed their EOL care goal at least once over a period 
of 16 months. Caregivers of PWSDs with lower quality of life (RR: 1.15, CI: 
1.06, 1.24), who expected shorter life expectancy for PWSDs (RR: 10.34, CI: 
2.14, 49.99) and who had an advance care planning discussion (RR: 3.52, CI: 
1.11, 11.18) were more likely to have a goal of minimal life extension for PWSD. 
Caregivers with higher anticipatory grief (RR: 0.96, CI: 0.93,1) were more 
likely to have a goal of maximal life extension. Change in PWSDs' quality of 
life and change in caregivers' anticipatory grief were associated with change in 
caregivers' EOL care goals.
CONCLUSION: Caregivers' EOL care goals for PWSDs change over time with change in 
PWSD and caregiver related factors. Findings have implications regarding how 
health care providers can engage with caregivers.

As the size of the population aged 65 and older continues to grow, the incidence 
and mortality rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasing annually. 
Unfortunately, current treatments only treat symptoms temporarily and do not 
alter the patients' life expectancy or course of AD. Mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) have shown a certain therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases 
including AD due to their neuroinflammatory regulation and neuroprotective 
effects. However, the low survival and homing rates of MSCs after 
transplantation seriously affect their therapeutic effectiveness. Therefore, 
appropriate in vitro preconditioning is necessary to increase the survival and 
homing rates of MSCs to improve their effectiveness in treating AD. Here we 
summarize the therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in AD and the chemical reagents 
used for the pretreatment of MSCs.

The number of people living with dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, is 
increasing worldwide. Persons with dementia often have a high risk of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and they are therefore theoretically 
eligible for treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, in this 
population, beneficial and harmful effects of cardiovascular risk management 
(CVRM) may be different compared to older persons without cognitive impairment. 
Current CVRM guidelines are based on trials from which persons with dementia 
were excluded. In this narrative review, we will discuss how current guidelines 
can be translated to persons with dementia and which aspects should be taken 
into account when treating hypertension and hyperlipidemia to prevent major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Survival time is significantly shorter in 
persons with dementia. We therefore suggest that since the main goal of CVRM is 
prevention of MACE, first of all, the patient's life expectancy and treatment 
wishes should be evaluated. Risk assessment tools are to be used with care, as 
they tend to overestimate the 5- and 10-year risk of MACE and benefit from CVRM 
in the prevention of MACE in persons with dementia. When the clinician and 
patient have decided that treatment is initiated or intensified, patients should 
be closely monitored since they are at high risk for adverse drugs events and 
overtreatment due to the natural course of blood pressure in persons with 
dementia. In the event of intolerance or side effects, medication should be 
switched or withdrawn. For persons with dementia and limited life expectancy, 
deprescribing should be part of usual care.

BACKGROUND: The aging society posits new socioeconomic challenges to which a 
potential solution is active and assisted living (AAL) technologies. 
Visual-based sensing systems are technologically among the most advantageous 
forms of AAL technologies in providing health and social care; however, they 
come at the risk of violating rights to privacy. With the immersion of 
video-based technologies, privacy-preserving smart solutions are being 
developed; however, the user acceptance research about these developments is not 
yet being systematized.
OBJECTIVE: With this scoping review, we aimed to gain an overview of existing 
studies examining the viewpoints of older adults and/or their caregivers on 
technology acceptance and privacy perceptions, specifically toward video-based 
AAL technology.
METHODS: A total of 22 studies were identified with a primary focus on user 
acceptance and privacy attitudes during a literature search of major databases. 
Methodological quality assessment and thematic analysis of the selected studies 
were executed and principal findings are summarized. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews) guidelines were followed at every step of this scoping review.
RESULTS: Acceptance attitudes toward video-based AAL technologies are rather 
conditional, and are summarized into five main themes seen from the two end-user 
perspectives: caregiver and care receiver. With privacy being a major barrier to 
video-based AAL technologies, security and medical safety were identified as the 
major benefits across the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals a very low methodological quality of the 
empirical studies assessing user acceptance of video-based AAL technologies. We 
propose that more specific and more end user- and real life-targeting research 
is needed to assess the acceptance of proposed solutions.

BACKGROUND: As the life expectancy of adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with Down 
syndrome increases for a plethora of reasons including recognition of rights, 
access, and technological and medical advances, there is a need to collate 
evidence about their quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: Using Schalock and Verdugo's multidimensional quality of life 
assessment model, this systematic review aimed to identify, synthesise and 
integrate the quantitative and qualitative evidence on quality of life in adults 
with Down syndrome via self-and proxy-reporting.
METHODS: Five databases were systematically searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, 
Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles published between 1980 
and 2022 along with grey literature and reference lists from relevant studies. A 
mixed methods systematic review was performed according to the Joanna Briggs 
Institute methodology using the convergent integrated approach. The review 
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies were included: 20 quantitative, 17 qualitative, and 
2 mixed methods studies. The synthesised findings were grouped into the 8 core 
domains of quality of life: personal development, self-determination, 
interpersonal relations, social inclusion, rights, emotional, physical and 
material well-being. Of the 39 studies, 30 (76.92%) reported on emotional 
well-being and 10 (25.64%) on rights. Only 7 (17.94%) studies reported that 
adults with Down syndrome have a good quality of life centred around 
self-determination and interpersonal relations. Most adults with Down syndrome 
wanted to become more independent, have relationships, participate in the 
community, and exercise their human rights. Self-reported quality of life from 
adults with Down syndrome was rated higher than proxy reported quality of life. 
Discrepancies in quality of life instruments were discovered.
CONCLUSION: This review highlighted the need for a better systematic approach to 
improving the quality of life in adults with Down syndrome in targeted areas. 
Future research is required to evaluate self-and proxy-reporting methods and 
culture-specific quality of life instruments that are more appropriate for 
adults with Down syndrome. In addition, further studies should consider 
including digital assistive technologies to obtain self-reported quality of life 
data in adults with Down syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat lungworm) is recognised as the 
leading cause of human eosinophilic meningitis, a serious condition observed 
when nematode larvae migrate through the CNS. Canine Neural Angiostrongyliasis 
(CNA) is the analogous disease in dogs. Both humans and dogs are accidental 
hosts, and a rapid diagnosis is warranted. A highly sensitive PCR based assay is 
available but often not readily accessible in many jurisdictions. An alternative 
DNA amplification assay that would further improve accessibility is needed. This 
study aimed to assess the diagnostic utility of a newly designed LAMP assay to 
detect DNA of globally distributed and invasive A. cantonensis and 
Angiostrongylus mackerrasae, the other neurotropic Angiostrongylus species, 
which is native to Australia.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from dogs with a 
presumptive diagnosis of A. cantonensis infection (2020-2022) were received for 
confirmatory laboratory testing and processed for DNA isolation and 
ultrasensitive Angiostrongylus qPCR targeting AcanR3390. A newly designed LAMP 
assay targeting the same gene target was directly compared to the reference 
ultrasensitive qPCR in a diagnostic laboratory setting to determine the presence 
of A. cantonensis DNA to diagnose CNA. The LAMP assay (Angie-LAMP) allowed the 
sensitive detection of A. cantonensis DNA from archived DNA specimens (Kappa = 
0.81, 95%CI 0.69-0.92; n = 93) and rapid single-step lysis of archived CSF 
samples (Kappa = 0.77, 95%CI 0.59-0.94; n = 52). Only A. cantonensis DNA was 
detected in canine CSF samples, and co-infection with A. mackerrasae using 
amplicon deep sequencing (ITS-2 rDNA) was not demonstrated. Both SYD.1 and AC13 
haplotypes were detected using sequencing of partial cox1.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The Angie-LAMP assay is a useful molecular tool for 
detecting Angiostrongylus DNA in canine CSF and performs comparably to a 
laboratory Angiostrongylus qPCR. Adaptation of single-step sample lysis improved 
potential applicability for diagnosis of angiostrongyliasis in a clinical 
setting for dogs and by extension, to humans.

Autistic people experience significant health disparities and reduced life 
expectancy. Barriers to accessing healthcare are associated with adverse health 
outcomes. Autism training and healthcare professionals' knowledge about autism 
is variable, and heterogeneity among autistic people leads to additional 
educational and clinical complexities. Autism remains nebulous for many 
practitioners, who are unclear about communication differences, access needs or 
life experiences common to autistic people. Healthcare environments can be 
challenging for all patients but autistic people may require specific 
accommodations to allow equitable access. The authors have developed a simple 
framework which may facilitate equitable clinical services at all points of 
access and care, using the acronym 'SPACE'. This encompasses five core autistic 
needs: Sensory needs, Predictability, Acceptance, Communication and Empathy. 
Three additional domains are represented by physical space, processing space and 
emotional space. This simple yet memorable framework encompasses commonalities 
shared by autistic people.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Has acceptance of heritable genome editing (HGE) and whole 
genome sequencing for preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-WGS) of human embryos 
changed after the onset of COVID-19 among infertility patients?
DESIGN: A written survey conducted between April and June 2018 and July and 
December 2021 among patients at a university-affiliated infertility practice. 
The questionnaire ascertained the acceptance of HGE for specific therapeutic or 
genetic 'enhancement' indications and of PGT-WGS to prevent adult disease.
RESULTS: In 2021 and 2018, 172 patients and 469 patients (response rates: 90% 
and 91%, respectively) completed the questionnaire. In 2021, significantly more 
participants reported a positive attitude towards HGE, for therapeutic and 
enhancement indications. In 2021 compared with 2018, respondents were more 
likely to use HGE to have healthy children with their own gametes (85% versus 
77%), to reduce disease risk for adult-onset polygenic disorders (78% versus 
67%), to increase life expectancy (55% versus 40%), intelligence (34% versus 
26%) and creativity (33% versus 24%). Fifteen per cent of the 2021 group 
reported a more positive attitude towards HGE because of COVID-19 and less than 
1% a more negative attitude. In contrast, support for PGT-WGS was similar in 
2021 and 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: A significantly increased acceptance of HGE was observed, but not 
of PGT-WGS, after the onset of COVID-19. Although the pandemic may have 
contributed to this change, the exact reasons remain unknown and warrant further 
investigation. Whether increased acceptability of HGE may indicate an increase 
in acceptability of emerging biomedical technologies in general needs further 
investigation.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to describe the trends in incidence, mortality, and 
burden of tracheal, bronchial and lung (TBL) cancer in Asia from 2010 through 
2019 and compare with global and other continental data.
METHODS: We collected TBL cancer data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) study from 2010 to 2019 in 49 countries and territories in Asia. For all 
locations, annual case data and age-standardized rates (ASRs) were used to 
investigate the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) of TBL from 2010 to 2019. The relative difference (%) between 
years was used to show comparative variations of ASRs for the indicators 
studied.
RESULTS: In 2019, more than 55% of TBL cancer cases and deaths occurred in Asian 
countries. A total of 57% of lung cancer patients lived in Asia and almost 60% 
of the global burden of lung cancer was imposed on Asian countries. From 2010 to 
2019, incidences, deaths, prevalence cases, and DALYs number of TBL cancer 
increased over 1.34-, 1.31-, 1.31-, and 1.26-fold, in Asia. During this period, 
the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), the age-standardized death rate 
(ASDR), the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), and the age-standardized 
DALYs rate (DALYs ASR) of TBL cancer decreased by 1, 3, 4, and 4%, respectively. 
While at the same time, the decreasing trend of these rates globally and in 
America and in Europe happened faster. In 2019, age-specific incidence, death, 
prevalence, and DALY cases of TBL cancer were peaking at 65-74, 70-74, 65-69, 
and 65-69 years, respectively. In 2019, the highest ASIR, ASDR, and DALYs ASR of 
TBL cancer was observed in East Asia countries and the highest ASPR in 
high-income Asia Pacific countries. Central Asia and high-income Asia Pacific 
countries experienced a decreasing trend in ASIR and ASDR, and the South Asia 
countries experienced the highest increasing trend from 2010 to 2019. ASPR only 
decreased in Central Asia, and DALYs ASR only increased in South Asia. In 2019, 
among high sociodemographic index (SDI) Asian countries, Brunei Darussalam had 
the highest ASIR, ASDR, and DALYs ASR and the Republic of Korea had the highest 
ASPR. Among high-middle SDIs, Turkey and Georgia; among middle SDIs, China and 
Armenia; among low-middle SDIs, Mongolia and the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea had the highest ASIR, ASDR, ASPR, and DALY ASR of TBL cancer. Among low 
SDI Asian countries, Pakistan had the highest ASIR, ASDR, ASPR, and DALY ASR of 
TBL cancer.
CONCLUSION: Most of the global burden of lung cancer occurs in Asian countries, 
and the decreasing trend of incidence, death, prevalence, and burden of this 
cancer in these countries is slower than in other regions. Therefore, the 
implementation of necessary measures in order to reduce the process of this 
cancer is considered urgent.

Dietary mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are linked to longevity in several 
species. But the mechanisms by which MUFAs extend lifespan remain unclear. Here 
we show that an organelle network involving lipid droplets and peroxisomes is 
critical for MUFA-induced longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. MUFAs upregulate 
the number of lipid droplets in fat storage tissues. Increased lipid droplet 
number is necessary for MUFA-induced longevity and predicts remaining lifespan. 
Lipidomics datasets reveal that MUFAs also modify the ratio of membrane lipids 
and ether lipids-a signature associated with decreased lipid oxidation. In 
agreement with this, MUFAs decrease lipid oxidation in middle-aged individuals. 
Intriguingly, MUFAs upregulate not only lipid droplet number but also peroxisome 
number. A targeted screen identifies genes involved in the co-regulation of 
lipid droplets and peroxisomes, and reveals that induction of both organelles is 
optimal for longevity. Our study uncovers an organelle network involved in lipid 
homeostasis and lifespan regulation, opening new avenues for interventions to 
delay aging.

South Carolina.

BACKGROUND: As solid organ transplant recipient (SOTR) life expectancy 
lengthens, the risk of developing other chronic diseases also increases.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cutaneous pathologies for which SOTRs are at an 
increased risk.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of SOTRs seen by dermatology from 
January 1, 2012 and June 1, 2022. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic 
regression. Benjamini Hochberg-adjusted P values were examined for multiplicity.
RESULTS: Five hundred and thirty SOTRs were identified. Patients had cutaneous 
malignancy (38.3%), precancerous lesions (32.5%), inflammatory (35.5%), and 
infectious diseases (33.1%). Odds of precancerous lesions were higher with 
increased age at transplant (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; adjusted P =.006), and lower 
with female sex (OR, 0.505; adjusted P =.006) and African American race (OR, 
0.027; adjusted P =.006). Odds of inflammatory lesions were lower with increased 
age at transplant (OR, 0.979; adjusted P =.023). Odds of infectious diseases 
were higher with prednisone use (OR, 2.615; adjusted P value =.023).
LIMITATIONS: This study is retrospective and was not able to capture patients 
seen by dermatology outside of our institution.
CONCLUSIONS: SOTRs at risk of cutaneous lesions should be referred to 
dermatology because these conditions may place a significant burden on the 
quality of life.

BACKGROUND: With the increase in life expectancy around the globe, the incidence 
of postoperative delirium (POD) among older people (≥65 years) is growing. 
Previous studies showed a wide variation in the incidence of POD, from 4% to 
53%, with a lack of specific evidence about the incidence of POD by specific 
surgery type among older people. The aim of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis was to determine the incidence of POD by surgery type within 
populations 65 years and over.
METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and CINAHL were 
searched until October 2020. Due to the relatively higher number of 
meta-analyses undertaken in this area of research, a streamlined systematic 
meta-analysis was proposed.
RESULTS: A total of 28 meta-analyses (comprising 284 individual studies) were 
reviewed. Data from relevant individual studies (n = 90) were extracted and 
included in the current study. Studies were grouped into eight surgery types and 
the incidence of POD for orthopedic, vascular, spinal, cardiac, colorectal, 
abdominal, urologic, and mixed surgeries was 20%, 14%, 13%, 32%, 14%, 30%, 10%, 
and 26%, respectively. POD detection instruments were different across the 
studies, with Confusion Assessment Method (CAM & CAM-ICU) being the most 
frequently adopted.
