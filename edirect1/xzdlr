OBJECTIVE: The epidemiology of sub-aneurysmal aortic dilatation (SAA) 25 - 29 mm 
is not fully understood, and the management of SAA is debated. Lack of evidence 
is particularly problematic in the screening setting. This study aimed to 
evaluate the long term outcome of men with screen detected SAAs, focusing on 
progression to an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and on the AAAs reaching the 
threshold diameter for surgical repair.
METHODS: Between 2006 and 2015, all 65 year old men with a screen detected SAA 
in middle Sweden were re-examined with ultrasound after five and 10 years. The 
primary outcomes were expansion to AAA ≥ 30 mm and progression to AAA ≥ 55 mm. 
Secondary outcomes were risk factors for progression, repair rate, and 
mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 1 020 65 year old men with a SAA were identified, of whom 
940 (92.2%; 95% confidence interval 91.0 - 93.8) had follow up. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimated incidence of AAA ≥ 30 mm development after the five year follow up 
(which was de facto carried out after a mean of 4.9 years) was 65.8% (61.6 - 
69.4), all < 55 mm. The corresponding KM-estimated incidence after the 10 year 
follow up (carried out after a mean of 11.9 years) was 95.1% (90.1 - 97.4), and 
29.7% (18.0 - 39.7) reached ≥ 55 mm. All 41 SAAs eventually expanding to ≥ 55 mm 
were ≥ 30 mm at the five year follow up. Of these, 32 had surgical repair with 
100% survival, six have scheduled repairs, and three (7.3%) were unfit for 
repair. The KM estimated all cause mortality rates at five and 10 years were 
7.0% and 17.9%, respectively, with no proven AAA related deaths.
CONCLUSION: A majority of SAAs eventually progress to an AAA, of which 30% are 
estimated to eventually reach the threshold for repair within 10 years. A follow 
up policy with an ultrasound examination after five years can safely and 
effectively identify those SAAs at risk of developing into clinically 
significant AAAs needing repair and may be considered for anyone with reasonably 
good life expectancy.

AIMS: We report the 2-year outcomes of the MitrAl ValvE RepaIr Clinical 
(MAVERIC) trial. Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is associated with poor 
outcomes for which there remains an unmet clinical need. ARTO is a transcatheter 
annular reduction device for the treatment of FMR and an emerging alternative 
for patients at high surgical risk. The MAVERIC trial was designed to evaluate 
the safety and performance of the ARTO system in FMR and heart failure (HF).
METHODS AND RESULTS: MAVERIC is an international multicentre, prospective, 
single arm study enrolling patients with FMR grade ≥ 2, New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) class ≥II symptoms despite maximal medical therapy. Patients 
were excluded if they had significant structural mitral valve abnormality or 
life expectancy <1 year. The primary outcome measures were a composite safety 
outcome and efficacy defined as mitral regurgitation (MR) reduction 30 days 
post-procedure. Secondary outcome measures included safety, change in MR grade, 
NYHA class and hospitalization for HF at 2 years. Forty-five patients were 
enrolled. The composite safety outcome was met (2/45 adverse events at 30 days) 
and no device-related deaths occurred at 2-year follow-up. A sustained reduction 
in MR [grade < 2: 21/31 (68%) vs. 31/31(0%); P < 0.0001], left ventricular 
end-diastolic volume index (90.0 ± 30 vs. 106 ± 26 mL/m2 ; P = 0.004) and 
anteroposterior diameter (35.5 ± 4.7 vs. 41.4 ± 4.6 mm; P < 0.0001) was seen at 
2 years compared to baseline. Progressive symptomatic improvement [NYHA class 
≤II: 27/34 (80%) vs. 12/34 (36%); P < 0.0001] and a reduction in HF 
hospitalizations (19.8% 2 years post vs. 52.3% 2 years prior; P < 0.001) were 
seen at 2 years compared to baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: The ARTO system is a safe and effective treatment for FMR with 
reductions in left ventricular end-diastolic volumes sustained to 2 years.

BACKGROUND: The role of statins in the management of dyslipidemia in elderly 
patients with different cardiovascular risks remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To study use of statins and associated factors in subjects aged 90 or 
over in the Community of Madrid, Spain.
METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional study that included all people aged 90 
or more residing in the Community of Madrid as of December 31, 2015. The 
clinical information was obtained from the database that contains the electronic 
medical records collected by family doctors in primary care. Comorbidity data 
are collected according to the International Classification of Primary Care, 
Second Edition (ICPC-2).
RESULTS: The study population comprised 59,423 subjects, with a mean age of 93.3 
(2.5) years (25.8% males). Slightly more than one quarter of the population 
(28.2%) was in treatment with statins, 21.9% were in primary prevention, and 
48.1% in secondary prevention. The multivariate analysis revealed the factors 
independently associated with statin treatment to be younger age, not being 
institutionalized, a higher Barthel score, a lower Charlson score, a higher body 
mass index, and a history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and 
cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of nonagenarians-mainly less frail 
patients with more comorbidities-in the Community of Madrid receive statin 
treatment. No clear efficacy has been demonstrated in reducing cardiovascular 
events in an age group with such a short life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to predict the life expectancy with disability (LED) 
of the elderly in China from 2010 to 2030 based on trends in stroke and 
dementia.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study.
METHODS: Data for 28,667 eligible individuals aged 65+ years were derived from 
the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) from 2002 to 2014. A 
discrete-time probabilistic Markov model was constructed with nine different 
health states characterized by the presence or absence of stroke, dementia, 
disability, or death. Binomial logistic regression was used to estimate the 
probability of state transition every 3 years based on the survey interval in 
the CLHLS. The number of disabled individuals was predicted in 2030 using 
Chinese population data from World Population Prospects 2019 and trends in the 
incidence and mortality for stroke and dementia as recorded in the CLHLS. A 
multistate life table was used to predict LED in 2030.
RESULTS: It is predicted that disability in those aged 65+ years in China will 
increase from 11.4 million in 2010 to 34.8 million in 2030. Cases associated 
with stroke and dementia are predicted to increase by 297.9% and 167.8%, 
respectively, for the 65-79 years age group, and by 402.1% and 247.0%, 
respectively, for the 80+ year age group. Life expectancy (LE) and LED for 
65-year-old individuals are predicted to be 16.1 and 2.2 years in 2030, 
respectively, with increases of 11.8% and 57.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: LED in the elderly is predicted to increase more rapidly than LE 
from 2010 to 2030, both stroke and dementia increasing the risk of disability.

Light harvesting as the first step in photosynthesis is of prime importance for 
life on earth. For a theoretical description of photochemical processes during 
light harvesting, spectral densities are key quantities. They serve as input 
functions for modeling the excitation energy transfer dynamics and spectroscopic 
properties. Herein, a recently developed procedure is applied to determine the 
spectral densities of the pigments in the minor antenna complex CP29 of 
photosystem II, which has recently gained attention because of its active role 
in non-photochemical quenching processes in higher plants. To this end, the 
density functional-based tight binding (DFTB) method has been employed to enable 
simulation of the ground state dynamics in a quantum-mechanics/molecular 
mechanics (QM/MM) scheme for each chlorophyll pigment. Subsequently, the 
time-dependent extension of the long-range corrected DFTB approach has been used 
to obtain the excitation energy fluctuations along the ground-state trajectories 
also in a QM/MM setting. From these results, the spectral densities have been 
determined and compared for different force fields and to spectral densities 
from other light-harvesting complexes. In addition, time-dependent and 
time-independent excitonic Hamiltonians of the system have been constructed and 
applied to the determination of absorption spectra as well as exciton dynamics.

Malaria epidemics represent one of the life-threatening diseases to low-income 
lying countries which subsequently affect the economic and social condition of 
mankind. In continuation in the development of a novel series of 1,2,4-trioxanes 
13a1-c1, 13a2-c2, and 13a3-c3 have been prepared and further converted into 
their hemisuccinate derivatives 14a1-c1, 14a2-c2, and 14a3-c3 respectively. All 
these new compounds were evaluated for their antimalarial activity against 
multidrug-resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis in mice by both oral and 
intramuscular (im) routes. Hydroxy-functionalized trioxane 13a1 showed 80% 
protection and its hemisuccinate derivative 14a1 showed 100% protection at a 
dose of 48 mg/kg × 4 days by both routes, which is twice active than artemisinin 
by oral route.

CRISPR-Cas9 generates double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) to activate cellular DNA 
repair pathways for genome editing. The repair of DSBs leads to small insertions 
or deletions (indels) and other complex byproducts, including large deletions 
and chromosomal translocations. Indels are well understood to disrupt target 
genes, while the other deleterious byproducts remain elusive. We developed a new 
in silico analysis pipeline for the previously described 
primer-extension-mediated sequencing assay to comprehensively characterize 
CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSB repair outcomes in human or mouse cells. We identified 
tremendous deleterious DSB repair byproducts of CRISPR-Cas9 editing, including 
large deletions, vector integrations, and chromosomal translocations. We further 
elucidated the important roles of microhomology, chromosomal interaction, 
recurrent DSBs, and DSB repair pathways in the generation of these byproducts. 
Our findings provide an extra dimension for genome editing safety besides 
off-targets. And caution should be exercised to avoid not only off-target 
damages but also deleterious DSB repair byproducts during genome editing.

BACKGROUND: Sex differences in clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, 
and postoperative outcomes of gastric and esophageal cancer are largely 
undefined. This study aimed to compare tumor and treatment characteristics and 
outcomes of gastric and esophageal cancer surgery between male and female 
patients.
METHODS: Patients after elective surgery for primary esophageal (EAC) or gastric 
adenocarcinoma (GAC) registered in the Dutch Upper GI Cancer Audit between 2011 
and 2016 were included. The primary endpoint, 5-year relative survival with 
relative excess risk (RER), i.e., adjusted for the normal life expectancy, was 
compared between male and female patients with EAC and GAC.
RESULTS: In total, 4937 patients were included (75% male) with a mean age of 
66 years. cT and cN-stages showed a similar distribution in male and female 
patients. In females, antrum GAC was more frequent (47% vs. 38%, p < 0.001). 
Female patients with EAC less frequently received neo-adjuvant treatment 
(OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.96, p = 0.033). For GAC, less postoperative morbidity 
(33% vs. 38% p = 0.017) and less re-interventions (12% vs. 16%, p = 0.008) were 
observed in females, although they had inferior 5-year relative survival (49% 
vs. 56%, RER = 1.31, 95% CI 1.09-1.58, p = 0.004). No differences in relative 
survival of EAC were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to significant sex differences in tumor location, 
female patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma less frequently received 
neo-adjuvant therapy, and female patients with gastric adenocarcinoma had 
inferior relative survival. Further consideration and exploration of sex 
differences in surgical treatment and outcomes are necessary to improve tailored 
treatment and outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Population aging, caused by an increase in life expectancy and 
decrease in fertility rates, has created changes and challenges in various 
spheres, including the labor market. Though health deteriorates with age, more 
and more older adults choose to stay in the labor force and work into late life.
OBJECTIVE: Understanding the effects of various work conditions on the health of 
older workers is crucial for designing policies and interventions to ensure 
healthy late life and maintain a productive workforce. To contribute to this 
endeavor, this study investigates the relationship between long working hours 
(LWH) and mortality among older populations.
METHODS: The study uses the Cox proportional hazards regression model to 
investigate data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) between the years 
1992-2016, a longitudinal nationally representative dataset from the United 
States.
RESULTS: The results indicate that working 50 hours or more per week is not 
associated with an increased risk of mortality, for the full sample (1.45 [95% 
CI: 0.86, 2.45]), for both genders (females 0.51 [95% CI: 0.06, 4.28], males 
1.45 [95% CI: 0.81, 2.61]), and for immigrants (female immigrants 0.55 [95% CI: 
0.06, 4.75], male immigrants 1.44 [95% CI: 0.79, 2.62]).
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis confirms and extends the findings of earlier studies 
by taking into consideration the potential impact of many demographic, 
socioeconomic, work-related and health-related factors.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the cost-utility of bracing versus 
observation in patients with thoracic scoliosis who would be indicated for 
bracing.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is high-quality evidence that bracing can 
prevent radiographic progression of spinal curvature in adolescent idiopathic 
scoliosis (AIS) patients with curves between 25° and 40° and Risser 0 to 2 
skeletal maturity index. However, to our knowledge, the cost-utility of bracing 
in AIS has not been established.
METHODS: A decision-analysis model comparing bracing versus observation was 
developed for a hypothetical 10-year old girl (Risser 0, Sanders 3) with a 35° 
main thoracic curve. We estimated the probability, cost, and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) for each node based on comprehensive review of the literature. 
Costs were adjusted for inflation based on Consumer Price Index and reported in 
terms of 2020 real dollars. Incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) was 
calculated based on a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo 
simulations of 1000 hypothetical patients. One-way sensitivity analyses were 
performed by varying cost, probability, and QALY estimates.
RESULTS: Our decision-analysis model revealed that bracing was the dominant 
treatment choice over observation at $50,000/QALY willingness to pay threshold. 
In simulation analysis of a hypothetical patient cohort, bracing was associated 
with lower net lifetime costs ($60,377 ± $5,340 with bracing vs. $85,279 ± $4543 
with observation) and higher net lifetime QALYs (24.1 ± 2.0 with bracing vs. 
23.9 ± 1.8 with observation). Bracing was associated with an INMB of $36,093 
(95% confidence interval $18,894-$55,963) over observation over the patient's 
lifetime. The model was most sensitive to the impact of bracing versus 
observation on altering the probability of requiring surgery, either as an 
adolescent or an adult.
CONCLUSION: Cost-utility analysis supports scoliosis bracing as the preferred 
choice in management of appropriately indicated AIS patients with thoracic 
scoliosis.Level of Evidence: 5.

Chapatti is a flattened circular flatbread also known as roti, poli, safari, and 
phulka, usually baked on a hot iron griddle. It is a staple diet of India and 
hence the quality of chapatti plays a major role in its acceptance. The overall 
quality of chapatti is dependent on various attributes such as pliability, 
handfeel, chapatti eating quality, and taste. These attributes are influenced by 
numerous factors, including wheat genotypes, wheat varieties, the molecular 
weight distribution of proteins, and processing techniques. This staple food has 
been extensively studied for various aspects, including processing, mechanism, 
fractionation, and reconstitution, quality improver, shelf life extension and 
also the mechanization of processing. This review focus on all the 
above-mentioned aspects and innovations carried out in this area.

Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, 27516.

Despite decades of progress, the future of life expectancy in the United States 
is uncertain due to widening socioeconomic disparities in mortality, continued 
disparities in mortality across racial/ethnic groups, and an increase in 
extrinsic causes of death. These trends prompt us to scrutinize life expectancy 
in a high-income but enormously unequal society like the United States, where 
social factors determine who is most able to maximize their biological lifespan. 
After reviewing evidence for biodemographic perspectives on life expectancy, the 
uneven diffusion of health-enhancing innovations throughout the population, and 
the changing nature of threats to population health, we argue that sociology is 
optimally positioned to lead discourse on the future of life expectancy. Given 
recent trends, sociologists should emphasize the importance of the social 
determinants of life expectancy, redirecting research focus away from extending 
extreme longevity and towards research on social inequality with the goal of 
improving population health for all.

Pancreatic cancer is a challenging malignancy with limited treatment options and 
poor life expectancy. The only curative option is surgical resection, but only 
15%-20% of patients are resectable at presentation because more than 50% of 
patients has distant metastasis at diagnosis and the rest of them has locally 
advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The standard of care first line treatment for 
LAPC patients is chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Recent 
developments in minimally invasive ablative techniques may add to the treatment 
armamentarium of LAPC. There are increasing number of studies evaluating these 
novel ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation, microwave 
ablation, cryoablation and irreversible electroporation. Most studies which 
included pancreatic tumor ablation, demonstrated improved overall survival in 
LAPC patients. However, the exact protocols are yet to set up to which stage of 
the treatment algorithm ablative techniques can be added and in what kind of 
treatment combinations. Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer has dismal 
prognosis with 5-year survival is only 3%. The most common metastatic site is 
the liver as 90% of pancreatic cancer patients develop liver metastasis. 
Chemotherapy is the primary treatment option for patients with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer. However, when the tumor is not responding to chemotherapy or 
severe drug toxicity develops, locoregional liver-directed therapies can provide 
an opportunity to control intrahepatic disease progression and improve survival 
in selected patients. During the last decade new therapeutic options arose with 
the advancement of minimally invasive technologies to treat pancreatic cancer 
patients. These new therapies have been a topic of increasing interest due to 
the severe prognostic implications of locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic 
cancer and the low comorbid risk of these procedures. This review summarizes new 
ablative options for patients with LAPC and percutaneous liver-directed 
therapies for patients with liver-dominant metastatic disease.

PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Nowadays, the incidence of schizophrenia is noticeably 
increased. If left undiagnosed and untreated, it will lead to impaired social 
functions, repeated hospital admissions, decline in quality of life and life 
expectancy. However, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is complicated and 
challenging. Both genetic and environmental factors are considered as important 
contributors to the development and progression of this disorder. The 
environmental factors have been linked to changes in gene expression through 
epigenetic modulations, which have raised more and more research interests in 
recent years. This review article is to summarize the current findings and 
understanding of epigenetic modulation associated with pathogenesis of 
schizophrenia, aiming to provide useful information for further research in 
developing biomarkers for schizophrenia.
RECENT FINDINGS: Three major types of epigenetic modulations have been described 
in this article. Firstly, both DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylated have been 
associated with schizophrenia via analyzing post-mortem brain tissues and 
peripheral blood of patients. Specific changes of non-coding RNAs, particularly 
microRNAs and long-chain non-coding RNAs, have been observed in central and 
peripheral samples of schizophrenia patients, indicating their significant 
diagnostic value for the disease, and may also potentially predict treatment 
response. The correlation between histone modification and schizophrenia, 
however, is largely unclear.
SUMMARY: Epigenetic modulations, including DNA methylation, ncRNA 
transcriptional regulation and histone modification, play an important role in 
the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Therefore, tests of these epigenetic 
alterations may be utilized to assist in the diagnosis and determination of 
strategies of individualized treatment in clinical practice.

Does Alice Live Here Anymore? Autonomy and Identity in Persons Living and Dying 
With Dementia.

Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, India.

Conventional scientific definitions of dementia, or its newer proposed 
alternate-neurocognitive disorders place emphasis upon cognitive function, 
particularly memory. The changes in thought, emotion, behavior, personality, and 
biological function are usually considered only of secondary importance. At the 
core of the illness, however, lies a progressive loss of self, and by extension, 
of personhood, identity, autonomy, and agency. The identity of the person living 
with dementia, and the deterioration of a sense of self assumes significance in 
planning end of life care, including palliative care. A consideration of self 
and identity is also significant where physician assisted death, incorporating 
euthanasia, has legal sanctity. As dementia progresses, there is usually a 
progressive loss of personal decision making capacity and legal competence. 
Shared decision making, advance care directives and proxy representatives are 
options available to safeguard autonomy and agency in such cases. Advance care 
directives are often treated as static documents. The loss of self and 
deterioration of identity in persons with dementia means, that there is a 
psychological discontinuity across time and space, though biological continuity 
is retained. The discontinuity in self and identity however, imply that the 
person with dementia changes considerably and so too may values and beliefs. A 
document which best reflected the wishes of the person with dementia in the 
past, may not always do so now. Advance directives and proxy representatives may 
need to be dynamic and evolve over time, particularly where end of life care and 
physician assisted death is being invoked.

INTRODUCTION: Primary cardiac paragangliomas are rare tumors. Metastatic disease 
is even rarer. Surgical management is technically challenging, and sometimes 
even impossible. Available therapeutic modalities for metastatic disease include 
external beam radiation therapy as well as systemic treatments, namely 131I-MIBG 
and more recently, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 
177Lu-DOTATATE. To our knowledge, this is the first case of progressive 
unresectable cardiac paraganglioma with intracardiac extension treated with 
dosimetry based personalized PRRT to be reported. This case is of particular 
interest since it documents for the first time the efficacy, and especially the 
safety of the 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in this precarious context for which 
therapeutic options are limited.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old man with no medical history consulted for 
rapidly decreasing exercise tolerance. The investigation demonstrated an 
unresectable progressing metastatic cardiac paraganglioma with intracardiac 
extension. The patient was treated with personalized 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT and 
showed complete symptomatic and partial anatomical responses, with a 
progression-free survival of 13 months.
CONCLUSIONS: PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE should be considered for inoperable 
cardiac paraganglioma. No major hemodynamic complications were experienced. 
Therapy resulted in safety and substantially improved quality of life.

Scale structure and reflectance activity of a Mindanao endemic weevil from the 
genus Metapocyrtus has been studied for the first time. Specimens of 
Metapocyrtus apoensis Schultze, 1925 were collected through opportunistic 
sampling in Mount Calayo, Musuan, Mindanao, Philippines last February 2020. A 
total of three individuals of the species were collected all in lower 
dipterocarp forest with elevation of 500 masl-600 masl. Three specimens were 
then examined under Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray 
(SEM_EDX) to analyse its scale structures and reflectance activity. The study 
provides new locality record of the Mindanao endemic species first in Bukidnon 
region and an updated distribution in Mindanao based on recent published 
articles and museum collections. The species inhabits wide ranges of habitat 
types that greatly differ in elevation and vegetation. Examination of scale's 
structure through SEM revealed that M. apoensis scales are 50 μm-70 μm in 
diameter which are almost circular in shape, slightly convex with rough like 
surface which is termed as non-ordered nipple-like structure. The scales' shape 
and surface structure clearly differ from other genera of curculionids based on 
published articles. Analysis of the particles on the weevil's elytra done by EDX 
reveals several elements that contribute to its iridescence. Major elements such 
as carbon (42.3%), oxygen (27.7%) and nitrogen (15.1%) come in relatively high 
atomic concentrations. Microspectrometer revealed a peak reflectance wavelength 
of about 569.7 nm. This explains the yellow-green iridescence observed on the 
dorsal side of the weevil. The concentration of the scale in pits serves for 
protection, intraspecific recognition and camouflage. Despite of widespread 
distribution and high abundance of this species in Mindanao, anthropogenic 
disturbances such as agricultural activities are on-going which extend towards 
their microhabitat. Monitoring to its population is recommended as the species 
is restricted only in Mindanao.

With improvement in living standards and average life expectancy, 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease incidences and mortality have been 
increasing annually. Paeonia suffruticosa, a natural herb, has been used for the 
treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for thousands of years in 
Eastern countries. Paeonol is an active ingredient extracted from Paeonia 
suffruticosa. Previous studies have extensively explored the clinical benefits 
of paeonol. However, comprehensive reviews on the cardiovascular protective 
effects of paeonol have not been conducted. The current review summarizes 
studies reporting on the protective effects of paeonol on the cardiovascular 
system. This study includes studies published in the last 10 years. The 
biological characteristics of Paeonia suffruticosa, pharmacological mechanisms 
of paeonol, and its toxicological and pharmacokinetic characteristics were 
explored. The findings of this study show that paeonol confers protection 
against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease through various mechanisms, 
including inflammation, platelet aggregation, lipid metabolism, mitochondria 
damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and non-coding RNA. Further 
studies should be conducted to elucidate the cardiovascular benefits of paeonol.

Women outweighed men at life expectancy in Bangladesh: does it mean a better 
quality of life?

Alam MZ(1).

Author information:

Bangladesh.

INTRODUCTION: Men had a higher life expectancy than women until 2000 in 
Bangladesh. After 2000, statistics showed that women had a higher life 
expectancy than men. We aimed to address whether higher life expectancy is a 
gain or burden (Failures of Success) for older women.
METHODS: We utilised data from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey-2011, 
Health and Morbidity Status Survey-2014, Population and Housing Census-2011, 
Household Income and Expenditure Survey-2010, and primary data. We calculated 
and estimated gender-specific different aspects of quality of life.
FINDINGS: Findings showed that the mean age at marriage was 5.8 years lower for 
women, while life expectancy was three years higher than men; thus, women were 
expected to live for 8.8 years alone. Both disabilities and morbidities were 
higher among women than men; hence they had lower healthy life expectancy. About 
53% of women could work daily activities while 8% higher for men. Only 2.4% of 
women earned while almost 58% for men. Depression and loneliness were also 
higher among women than men. The value of the active ageing index and quality of 
life were also lower for women than men.
CONCLUSION: This study overall found that there were the Failures of Success 
especially for older women in Bangladesh, as increasing life expectancies led 
them to extra years of chronic illness, economic insolvency, more anxiety and 
depression, and increasing misery. Therefore, sex and gender and their inherent 
differences should inform decision making to promote gender equity in health. 
The government and policymakers may intervene for quality of life, especially 
for women, through reducing gender stereotypes and increasing community 
engagement. Without considering the quality of life, healthy ageing cannot be 
ensured.

Lithium and Sodium Ion Binding Mechanisms and Diffusion Rates in Lignin-Based 
Hard Carbon Models.

Hard carbons are the primary candidate for the anode of next-generation 
sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage, as they are sustainable and 
can possess high charge capacity and long cycle life. These properties along 
with diffusion rates and ion storage mechanisms are highly dependent on 
nanostructures. This work uses reactive molecular dynamics simulations to 
examine lithium and sodium ion storage mechanisms and diffusion in lignin-based 
hard carbon model systems with varying nanostructures. It was found that sodium 
will preferentially localize on the surface of curved graphene fragments, while 
lithium will preferentially bind to the hydrogen dense interfaces of crystalline 
and amorphous carbon domains. The ion storage mechanisms are explained through 
ion charge and energy distributions in coordination with snapshots of the 
simulated systems. It was also revealed that hard carbons with small crystalline 
volume fractions and moderately sized sheets of curved graphene will yield the 
highest sodium-ion diffusion rates at ∼10-7 cm2/s. Self-diffusion coefficients 
were determined by mean square displacement of ions in the models with extension 
through a confined random walk theory.
