Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common neurological disorder in dogs. A secondary 
injury that occurs in the acute phase causes expansion of inflammation, 
resulting in lesion extension and further loss of function. Mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) have trophic effects and the ability to migrate toward injured 
tissues; therefore, MSC-based therapy is considered promising for the treatment 
of canine SCI. We recently reported that bone marrow peri-adipocyte cells 
(BM-PACs) can be obtained from canine bone marrow and have stem cell potential 
superior to that of conventional bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs). However, their 
therapeutic potential for SCI have been still unknow. Here, we first evaluated 
the ability of BM-PACs to secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and their 
migration ability toward inflammatory milieu in vitro. BM-PACs can secrete HGF 
in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
and IL-1β, and exhibit migration ability toward these cytokines. Next, BM-PACs 
were intravenously administered into nude mice with acute SCI to analyze the 
homing ability and therapeutic effects of HGF secreted by BM-PACs. BM-PACs homed 
to the injured spinal cord, where the HGF expression level increased 7 days 
after administration. Intravenous administration of BM-PACs induced functional 
recovery and pathological improvement, indicated by less demyelinating area, 
more preserved axons, and less glial scar formation compared with the mice only 
received vehicle. These findings suggest that the intravenous administration of 
BM-PACs can be a novel therapeutic intervention for acute canine SCI.

OBJECTIVES: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England has 
implemented severity-of-disease modifiers that give greater weight to health 
benefits accruing to patients who experience a larger shortfall in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) under current standard of care than healthy 
individuals. This requires an estimate of quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE) of the general population based on age and sex. Previous QALE population 
norms are based on nearly 30-year-old assessments of health-related quality of 
life in the general population. This study provides updated QALE estimates for 
the English population based on age and sex.
METHODS: 5-level version of EQ-5D data for 14 412 participants from the Health 
Survey for England (waves 2017 and 2018) were pooled, and health-related quality 
of life population norms were calculated. These norms were combined with 
official life tables from the Office for National Statistics for 2017 to 2019 
using the Sullivan method to derive QALE estimates based on age and sex. Values 
were discounted using 0%, 1.5%, and 3.5% discount rates.
RESULTS: QALE at birth is 68.24 QALYs for men and 68.21 QALYs for women. These 
values are significantly lower than previously published QALE population norms 
based on the older 3-level version of EQ-5D data.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new QALE population norms for England that serve 
to establish absolute and relative QALY shortfalls for the purpose of health 
technology assessments.

The main objectives of this study were to (i) assess variation within fine 
particles (PM2.5) and tropospheric ozone (O3) time series in Khorramabad (Iran) 
between 2019 (before) and 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic); (ii) assess 
relationship between PM2.5 and O3, the PM2.5/O3 ratio, and energy consumption; 
and (iii) estimate the health effects of exposure to ambient PM2.5 and O3. From 
hourly PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, we applied both linear-log and integrated 
exposure-response functions, city-specific relative risk, and baseline incidence 
values to estimate the health effects over time. A significant correlation was 
found between PM2.5 and O3 (r =-0.46 in 2019, r =-0.55 in 2020, p < 0.05). The 
number of premature deaths for all non-accidental causes (27.5 and 24.6), 
ischemic heart disease (7.3 and 6.3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17 
and 19.2), and lung cancer (9.2 and 6.25) attributed to ambient PM2.5 exposure 
and for respiratory diseases (4.7 and 5.4) for exposure to O3 above 10 µg m-3 
for people older than 30-year-old were obtained in 2019 and 2020. The number of 
years of life lost declined by 11.6% in 2020 and exposure to PM2.5 reduced the 
life expectancy by 0.58 and 0.45 years, respectively in 2019 and 2020. Compared 
to 2019, the restrictive measures associated to COVID-19 pandemic led to 
reduction in PM2.5 (-25.5%) and an increase of O3 concentration (+ 8.0%) in 
Khorramabad.

Dementia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron diseases 
cause significant disability and mortality worldwide. Although the etiology of 
these diseases is unknown, highly correlated disease prevalences would indicate 
the involvement of common etiologic factors. Here we used published 
epidemiological data in 195 countries worldwide to investigate the possible 
intercorrelations among the prevalences of these diseases. All analyses were 
carried out using nonparametric statistics on rank-transformed data to assure 
the robustness of the results. We found that all 6 pairwise correlations among 
the prevalences of the 4 diseases were very high (>.9, P < .001). A factor 
analysis (FA) yielded only a single component which comprised all 4 disease 
prevalences and explained 96.3% of the variance. These findings indicate common 
etiologic factor(s). Next, we quantified the contribution of 3 country-specific 
factors (population size, life expectancy, latitude) to the common grouping of 
prevalences by estimating the reduction in total FA variance explained when the 
effect of these factors was eliminated by using the prevalence residuals from a 
linear regression where theses factor were covariates. FA of these residuals 
yielded again only a single component comprising all 4 diseases which explained 
71.5% of the variance, indicating that the combined contribution of population 
size, life expectancy and latitude accounted for 96.3% - 71.5% = 24.8% of the FA 
variance explained. The fact that the 3 country-specific factors above accounted 
for only 24.8% of the FA variance explained by the original (ranked) disease 
prevalences, in the presence still of a single grouping factor, strongly 
indicates the operation of other unknown factors jointly contributing to the 
pathogenesis of the 4 diseases. We discuss various possible factors involved, 
with an emphasis on biologic pathogens (viruses, bacteria) which have been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases in previous studies.

BACKGROUND: To report the burden of cancers attributable to high fasting plasma 
glucose (HFPG) by sex, age, location, cancer type and Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI) over the period 1990 to 2019 for 204 countries and territories.
METHODS: Using the Comparative Risk Assessment approach of Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study 2019, the burden of cancers attributable to HFPG was 
reported in 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, in 2019 there were an estimated 419.3 thousand cancer deaths 
(95% UI: 115.7 to 848.5) and 8.6 million cancer DALYs (2.4 to 17.6) attributable 
to HFPG. By sex, 4.6 (1.1 to 9.9) and 4.0 (1.1 to 8.4) million global cancer 
DALYs were attributable to HFPG in men and women, respectively. The global 
age-standardized death and DALY rates of cancers attributable to HFPG (per 
100,000) have increased by 27.8% (20.5 to 38.7%) and 24.5% (16.4 to 35.6%), 
respectively, since 1990. High-income North America (9.5 [2.7 to 18.8]) and 
Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa (2.0 [0.5 to 4.2]) had the highest and lowest 
regional age-standardized death rates, respectively, for cancers attributable to 
HFPG. In 2019, the global number of attributable cancer DALYs were highest in 
65-69 age group. Moreover, there was an overall positive association between SDI 
and the regional age-standardized DALY rate for HFPG-attributable cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: HFPG was associated with more burden in 2019. Preventive programs 
for diabetes and screening of individuals with diabetes for cancers, especially 
in older males living in developed countries, are required to arrest the large 
increases in HFPG-attributable cancers.

INTRODUCTION: There is limited understanding of how older adults can reach 
kinematic goals in rehabilitation while performing exergames and conventional 
exercises, and how similar or different the kinematics during exergaming are 
when compared with conventional therapeutic exercise with similar movement. The 
aim of this study was to describe the movement characteristics performed during 
exercise in custom-designed exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises 
among patients who have undergone unilateral total knee replacement (TKR). In 
addition, the secondary aim was to assess the relation of these exercise 
methods, and to assess participants' perceived exertion and knee pain during 
exergaming and exercising.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients up to 4 months after the TKR surgery were 
invited in a single-visit exercise laboratory session. A 2D motion analysis and 
force plates were employed to evaluate movement characteristics as the volume, 
range, and intensity of movement performed during custom-designed knee 
extension-flexion and weight shifting exergames and conventional therapeutic 
exercises post TKR. The perceived exertion and knee pain were assessed using the 
Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion and Visual Analog Scale, respectively.
RESULTS: Evaluation of seven patients with TKR [age median (IQR), 65 (10) years] 
revealed that the volume and intensity of movement were mostly higher during 
exergames. Individual goniometer-measured knee range of motion were achieved 
either with exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises, especially in knee 
extension exercises. The perceived exertion and knee pain were similar after 
exergames and conventional therapeutic exercises.
CONCLUSIONS: During custom-designed exergaming the patients with TKR achieve the 
movement characteristics appropriate for post-TKR rehabilitation without 
increasing the stress and pain experienced even though the movement 
characteristics might be partly different from conventional therapeutic 
exercises by the volume and intensity of movement. Physical therapists could 
consider implementing such exergames in rehabilitation practice for patients 
with TKR once effectiveness have been approved and they are widely available.

Rough set theory is an extension of set theory with two additional unary 
set-theoretic operators known as approximation in order to extract information 
and knowledge. It needs the basic, or say definable, knowledge to approximate 
the undefinable knowledge in a knowledge space using the pair of approximation 
operators. Many existed approximation operators are expressed with unary form. 
How to mine the knowledge which is asked by binary form with rough set has 
received less research attention, though there are strong needs to reveal the 
answer for this challenging problem. There exist many information with matroid 
constraints since matroid provides a platform for combinatorial algorithms 
especially greedy algorithm. Hence, it is necessary to consider a matroidal 
structure on two sets no matter the two sets are the same or not. In this paper, 
we investigate the construction of approximation operators expressed by binary 
form with matroid theory, and the constructions of matroidal structure aided by 
a pair of approximation operators expressed by binary form.First, we provide a 
kind of matroidal structure-TD-matroid defined on two sets as a generalization 
of Whitney classical matroid.Second, we introduce this new matroidal 
construction to rough set and construct a pair of approximation operators 
expressed with binary form.Third, using the existed pair of approximation 
operators expressed with binary form, we build up two concrete 
TD-matroids.Fourth, for TD-matroid and the approximation operators expressed by 
binary form on two sets, we seek out their properties with aspect of posets, 
respectively.Through the paper, we use some biological examples to explain and 
test the correct of obtained results. In summary, this paper provides a new 
approach to research rough set theory and matroid theory on two sets, and to 
study on their applications each other.

Some European countries, such as Greece and Spain, were severely hit by the 2008 
economic crisis whereas others, such as Germany, were practically spared by it. 
This divergence allowed us to implement a difference in differences research 
design which offered the possibility to observe the long-lasting effects 
produced by the crisis on European life expectancy. Our analysis-based on 
Eurostat data from 2001 to 2019-shows that life expectancy increased faster, 
after the onset of the crisis, in those countries where the rise in unemployment 
was more intense. Furthermore, our results show that this gain in life 
expectancy persisted, and sometimes further increased, until 2019 when most 
macro-economic variables had returned to their pre-crisis values. Previous 
research has identified that mortality behaves procyclically in developed 
countries: when the economy slows down mortality decreases and vice versa. Our 
findings show, by contrast, that life expectancy behaves asymmetrically: it 
responded to an increase but not to a decrease in unemployment. This calls for a 
reconsideration of the causal mechanisms linking together the economic cycle and 
mortality in developed countries.

With the increase in life expectancy in the global population, aging societies 
have emerged in many countries, including China. As a common sensory defect in 
the elderly population, the prevalence of age-related hearing loss and its 
influence on society are increasing yearly. Metabolic syndrome is currently one 
of the main health problems in the world. Many studies have demonstrated that 
metabolic syndrome and its components are correlated with a variety of 
age-related diseases of the peripheral sensory system, including age-related 
hearing loss. Both age-related hearing loss and metabolic syndrome are 
high-prevalence chronic diseases, and many people suffer from both at the same 
time. In recent years, more and more studies have found that mitochondrial 
dysfunction occurs in both metabolic syndrome and age-related hearing loss. 
Therefore, to better understand the impact of metabolic syndrome on age-related 
hearing loss from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction, we reviewed the 
literature related to the relationship between age-related hearing loss and 
metabolic syndrome and their components to discern the possible role of 
mitochondria in both conditions.

The modified German subjective vitality scale (SVS-GM): Psychometric properties 
and application in daily life.

Subjective vitality describes the positive feeling of experiencing physical and 
mental energy, which can lead to purposive actions, but no German instruments 
exist with action-oriented verbiage: This work supports the development and 
modification of already existing German Subjective Vitality Scales and provides 
further evidence for its psychometric properties. In a first step (N = 56) two 
modified (action-oriented) short-forms were developed. An extension of time 
perspectives (past, present, future) should also enrich the scale by enhancing 
the accuracy of self-reports. Study 1 (N = 183) then examined the psychometric 
properties for each time perspective. Study 2 (N = 27) was a 6-day diary study 
to identify the reliability of within- and between-person differences in 
vitality over time and working days with responses recorded three times per day. 
The exploratory factor analysis from study 1 revealed a three-factor solution 
with three items each. Test-retest reliability was moderate for the past and 
future time perspective and less stable for state subjective vitality. The 
modified German Subjective Vitality Scale (SVS-GM) showed divergent validity 
with fatigue, negative affect, and optimism, and convergent but distinguishable 
validity with life satisfaction, positive affect, and perceived self-efficacy. 
High reliability for daily vitality measures (with lower vitality rates in the

working days and days off. The SVS-GM shows good psychometric properties in 
different settings and provides researchers with a 3-item (for cross-sectional 
or longitudinal studies) and 1-item (for short screenings) version to measure 
subjective vitality in German-speaking populations.

The early intestinal colonization of functional microbial groups plays an 
essential role in infant gut health, with most studies targeting the initial 
colonization period from birth to 6 months of age. In a previous report, we 
demonstrated the metabolic cross-feeding of lactate and identified keystone 
species specified for lactate utilization in fecal samples of 40 healthy 
infants. We present here the extension of our longitudinal study for the period 
from 6 months to 2 years, with a focus on the colonization of functional groups 
involved in lactate metabolism and butyrate production. We captured the dynamic 
changes of the gut microbiota and reported a switch in the predominant 
lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, from Veillonella producing 
propionate in the first year to Anaerobutyrycum hallii producing butyrate in the 
second year of life. The significant increase in butyrate producers and fecal 
butyrate concentration was also pinpointed to the weaning period between 6 and 
10 months. Correlation analyses further suggested, for the first time, the 
metabolic cross-feeding of hydrogen in infants. In conclusion, our longitudinal 
study of 40 Swiss infants provides important insights into the colonization of 
functional groups involved in lactate metabolism and butyrate production in the 
first 2 years of life.

AIM: To clarify the high variability in COVID-19-related deaths during the first 
wave of the pandemic, we conducted a modeling study using publicly available 
data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 13 population- and country-specific variables to 
predict the number of population-standardized COVID-19-related deaths in 43 
European countries using generalized linear models: the test-standardized number 
of SARS-CoV-2-cases, population density, life expectancy, severity of 
governmental responses, influenza-vaccination coverage in the elderly, vitamin D 
status, smoking and diabetes prevalence, cardiovascular disease death rate, 
number of hospital beds, gross domestic product, human development index and 
percentage of people older than 65 years.
RESULTS: We found that test-standardized number of SARS-CoV-2-cases and flu 
vaccination coverage in the elderly were the most important predictors, together 
with vitamin D status, gross domestic product, population density and government 
response severity explaining roughly two-thirds of the variation in COVID-19 
related deaths. The latter variable was positively, but only weakly associated 
with the outcome, i.e., deaths were higher in countries with more severe 
government response. Higher flu vaccination coverage and low vitamin D status 
were associated with more COVID-19 related deaths. Most other predictors 
appeared to be negligible.
CONCLUSION: Adequate vitamin D levels are important, while flu-vaccination in 
the elderly and stronger government response were putative aggravating factors 
of COVID-19 related deaths. These results may inform protection strategies 
against future infectious disease outbreaks.

BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common 
infections worldwide, but little is known about their global scale and long-term 
trends. We aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of UTIs' burden along 
with its attributable risk factors at a global level, as well as the variations 
of the burdens according to socio-demographic status, regions, nations, sexes, 
and ages, which may be helpful in guiding targeted prevention and treatment 
programs.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were analyzed to 
depict the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of 
UTIs in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 by socio-demographic 
status, nations, region, sex, and age.
RESULTS: Globally, 404.61 million cases, 236,790 deaths, and 520,200 DALYs were 
estimated in 2019. In particular, 2.4 times growth in deaths from 1990 to 2019 
was observed, along with an increasing age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) 
from 2.77/100,000 to 3.13/100,000. Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) was 
consistently pronounced in regions with higher socio-demographic index (SDI), 
which presented remarkable upward trends in ASMR and age-standardized DALY rate 
(ASDR). In contrast, countries with a low SDI or high baseline burden achieved a 
notable decline in burden rates over the past three decades. Although the ASIR 
was 3.6-fold higher in females than males, there was no sex-based difference in 
ASMR and ASDR. The burden rate typically increased with age, and the annual 
increasing trend was more obvious for people over 60 years, especially in higher 
SDI regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of UTIs showed variations according to socio-demographic 
status, nation, region, sex, and age in the last three decades. The overall 
increasing burden intimates that proper prevention and treatment efforts should 
be strengthened, especially in high-income regions and aging societies.

University, Hangzhou, China.

AIMS: To investigate the sex-specific global burden of neonatal preterm birth 
(NPB) vision impairment by year, age, and socioeconomic status using years lived 
with disability (YLDs).
METHODS: The global, regional, and national sex-specific YLD numbers, crude YLD 
rates, and age-standardized YLD rates of NPB-related moderate and severe vision 
loss and blindness were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. 
The Wilcoxon test and linear regression were used to investigate the 
relationship between sex difference in age-standardized YLD rates and the Human 
Development Index (HDI).
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, the gender disparity in age-standardized YLD 
rates for NPB-related vision impairment remained stable, increasing from 10.2 
[95% uncertainty interval (UI) 6.7-14.6] to 10.4 (95% UI 6.9-15.0) for men and 
10.3 (95% UI 6.8-14.7) to 10.7 (95% UI 7.2-15.1) for women, with women 
consistently having higher age-standardized YLD rates. Between the ages of 25 
and 75, women had higher YLD rates than males, with the biggest disparity in the 
60-64 age group. In 2019, sex difference in age-standardized YLD rates across 
195 nations was statistically significant. Women had higher age-standardized YLD 
rates than men in both low (Z = -3.53, p < 0.001) and very high HDI countries (Z 
= -4.75, p < 0.001). Additionally, age-standardized YLD rates were found to be 
adversely associated with HDI (male: Standardized β = -0.435, female: 
Standardized β = -0.440; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Despite advancements in worldwide NPB health care, sexual 
differences in NPB-related vision impairment burden showed little change. Female 
had higher burden than male, particularly in low and very high socioeconomic 
status countries.

OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the epidemiologic and cost-effectiveness impact of 
shifting the focus from population-based screening toward a targeted management 
approach for genital chlamydia infection.
DESIGN: Modeling study, implementing an individual-based, stochastic, dynamic 
network model.
SETTING: Hong Kong.
POPULATION: A hypothetical sample network of 10,000 people with a partnership 
distribution based on Hong Kong's sexually active population of reproductive age 
(age 18-49 years).
INTERVENTIONS: In this study, we present several scenarios with different 
implementations of universal vs. targeted screening (based on partner numbers). 
We also explored the impact of (1) screening only, (2) screening plus expedited 
partner therapy, and (3) screening plus partner testing.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Change of chlamydia prevalence before and after 
implementing the different strategies. The cost-effectiveness analysis reports 
total direct cost from a health provider perspective, the QALYs gained, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
RESULTS: In comparing the effects of universal screening only and targeted 
screening of the high-risk population, the mean prevalence during the 10th year 
of intervention was 2.75 ± 0.30% and 2.35 ± 0.21%, respectively (compared with 
3.24 ± 0.30% and 3.35 ± 0.21% before the interventions, respectively). The 
addition of contact tracing to the latter targeted screening scenario reduces 
the mean prevalence during the 10th year of intervention to 1.48 ± 0.13% 
(compared with 3.31 ± 0.33% at baseline) in the best-case of testing before 
treatment and maximal contact-tracing effectiveness (40%). Overall, the most 
effective scenarios were those for which interventions focused on the high-risk 
population defined by the number of partners, with contact tracing included. The 
ICER for targeted screening with contact tracing at 20% and 40% efficiency was 
$4,634 and $7,219 per QALY gained, respectively (10-year time horizon). 
Expedited partner therapy did not significantly impact overall chlamydia 
prevalence and caused overtreatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that targeted screening with strengthened 
contact tracing efforts is the most cost-effective strategy to reduce the 
prevalence of chlamydia in Hong Kong.

ABSTRACT: For over three decades, the materials tetrahedron has captured the 
essence of materials science and engineering with its interdependent elements of 
processing, structure, properties, and performance. As modern computational and 
statistical techniques usher in a new paradigm of data-intensive scientific 
research and discovery, the rate at which the field of materials science and 
engineering capitalizes on these advances hinges on collaboration between 
numerous stakeholders. Here, we provide a contemporary extension to the classic 
materials tetrahedron with a dual framework-adapted from the concept of a 
"digital twin"-which offers a nexus joining materials science and information 
science. We believe this high-level framework, the materials-information twin 
tetrahedra (MITT), will provide stakeholders with a platform to contextualize, 
translate, and direct efforts in the pursuit of propelling materials science and 
technology forward.
IMPACT STATEMENT: This article provides a contemporary reimagination of the 
classic materials tetrahedron by augmenting it with parallel notions from 
information science. Since the materials tetrahedron (processing, structure, 
properties, performance) made its first debut, advances in computational and 
informational tools have transformed the landscape and outlook of materials 
research and development. Drawing inspiration from the notion of a digital twin, 
the materials-information twin tetrahedra (MITT) framework captures a holistic 
perspective of materials science and engineering in the presence of modern 
digital tools and infrastructures. This high-level framework incorporates 
sustainability and FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, 
Reusable)-factors that recognize how systems impact and interact with other 
systems-in addition to the data and information flows that play a pivotal role 
in knowledge generation. The goal of the MITT framework is to give stakeholders 
from academia, industry, and government a communication tool for focusing 
efforts around the design, development, and deployment of materials in the years 
ahead.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy in China, the associated burden of 
low back and neck pain (spinal pain) on the healthcare system increases, posing 
a substantial public health challenge. This study aimed to investigate trends in 
spinal pain incidence across China from 1990 to 2019 and to predict incidence 
trends between 2020 and 2030.
METHODS: Data were derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. 
The annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) 
between 1990 and 2019 were calculated using Joinpoint regression analysis. The 
effects of age, period, and cohort on spinal pain were estimated by an 
age-period-cohort model. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) 
model was used to forecast incidence trends from 2020 to 2030.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of low 
back pain (LBP) significantly decreased in both male and female subjects, while 
the ASIR of neck pain (NP) slightly increased regardless of sex. Joinpoint 
regression analysis showed that the incidence rates of LBP decreased in all age 
groups, and incidence rates of NP increased after 45 years old among men and 
women. The age effects showed that the relative risks (RR) of LBP incidence 
increased with age, and the group aged 40-49 years had the highest RR for NP 
incidence, regardless of sex. Period effects showed that the risk of NP 
continuously increased with increasing time periods, but not in LBP. The cohort 
effect showed a continuously decreasing trend in later birth cohorts. The 
prediction results of the ARIMA model show that the ASIR of NP in both male and 
female subjects in China shows an increasing trend in the next 10 years, and the 
ASIR of LBP increased in male but decreased in female subjects.
CONCLUSION: Spinal pain has remained a major public health burden over the past 
30 years in China and will likely increase further with population aging. 
Therefore, spinal pain should be a priority for future research on prevention 
and therapy, and is especially critical as the aging population increases in 
China.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning uses algorithms that improve automatically through 
experience. This statistical learning approach is a natural extension of 
traditional statistical methods and can offer potential advantages for certain 
problems. The feasibility of using machine learning techniques in health care is 
predicated on access to a sufficient volume of data in a problem space.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of data collection from an 
adolescent population before and after a posterior spine fusion operation.
METHODS: Both physical and psychosocial data were collected. Adolescents 
scheduled for a posterior spine fusion operation were approached when they were 
scheduled for the surgery. The study collected repeated measures of patient 
data, including at least 2 weeks prior to the operation and 6 months after the 
patients were discharged from the hospital. Patients were provided with a Fitbit 
Charge 4 (consumer-grade health tracker) and instructed to wear it as often as 
possible. A third-party web-based portal was used to collect and store the 
Fitbit data, and patients were trained on how to download and sync their 
personal device data on step counts, sleep time, and heart rate onto the 
web-based portal. Demographic and physiologic data recorded in the electronic 
medical record were retrieved from the hospital data warehouse. We evaluated 
changes in the patients' psychological profile over time using several validated 
questionnaires (ie, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). 
Questionnaires were administered to patients using Qualtrics software. Patients 
received the questionnaire prior to and during the hospitalization and again at 
3 and 6 months postsurgery. We administered paper-based questionnaires for the 
self-report of daily pain scores and the use of analgesic medications.
RESULTS: There were several challenges to data collection from the study 
population. Only 38% (32/84) of the patients we approached met eligibility 
criteria, and 50% (16/32) of the enrolled patients dropped out during the 
follow-up period-on average 17.6 weeks into the study. Of those who completed 
the study, 69% (9/13) reliably wore the Fitbit and downloaded data into the 
web-based portal. These patients also had a high response rate to the 
psychosocial surveys. However, none of the patients who finished the study 
completed the paper-based pain diary. There were no difficulties accessing the 
demographic and clinical data stored in the hospital data warehouse.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies several challenges to long-term medical 
follow-up in adolescents, including willingness to participate in these types of 
studies and compliance with the various data collection approaches. Several of 
these challenges-insufficient incentives and personal contact between 
researchers and patients-should be addressed in future studies.
