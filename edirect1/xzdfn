METHODS: According to the PRISMA statement of publications published, we have 
carried out a systematic review focused on elderly patients who underwent 
surgical procedures in General and Surgery. Using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane 
library, a systematic search of the literature from 1992 to 2018 was performed. 
This enabled us to retrieve information from the selected articles on scales to 
evaluate medical fitness, functional status, or both, in the elderly or frail 
patients.
RESULTS: We reviewed 102 articles and selected the most frequently used 
assessment scales or indexes. After this extensive analysis, we selected 4 
functional scales (Katz Index, Barthel Scale, Karnofsky Performance Score, and 
Vulnerable Elders Survey), 4 clinical scales (American Society of 
Anaesthesiologists Index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Pfeiffer Test, and 
Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and 
Morbidity Scale) and finally, 2 mixed scales (American College of Surgeons 
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator and 
Edmonton Frail Scale).
CONCLUSIONS: No consensus on the use of a unified assessment scale for elderly 
patients exists. However, with this review, we provide a brief guideline about 
the most useful and used scales to perform a comprehensive assessment of 
geriatric patients undergoing surgery.

In the last decades, there has been an increase in life expectancy in the world, 
with the consequent modification in the proportion of adults over 60 years. This 
is accompanied by an increase in pathologies for which aging is the main risk 
factor, such as dementia and hearing loss, which profoundly affect the quality 
of life of individuals and their family and impact health system costs. Given 
the lack of disease-modifying treatments for dementia, the study of mechanisms 
to prevent its occurrence has become a world priority. In the year 2017, the 
Lancet "Commission for dementia prevention, intervention, and care" proposed a 
model, in which hearing loss emerged as a new modifiable risk factor for the 
development of dementia. This result undoubtedly has important consequences for 
the understanding the multifactorial nature of dementia, our daily clinical 
practice and public policies aimed at its prevention and treatment. In this 
article, we review the current evidence supporting the association between 
dementia and hearing loss, discussing the available strategies for prevention, 
detection and treatment of hearing loss and its possible impact on the natural 
course of dementia. A flow chart for the clinical management of different 
subgroups of patients is proposed.

BACKGROUND: The central analgesic tapentadol prolonged release (PR) has proven 
effective and generally well tolerated in a broad range of chronic pain 
conditions. Long-term data of its use are still scarce.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate long-term effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of 
tapentadol PR in patients with severe chronic osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain or 
low back pain (LBP) who responded to tapentadol in 1 of 4 preceding 12-week 
phase 3b clinical trials.
STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, uncontrolled, observational extension study of up to 
72 weeks.
SETTING: Fourteen centers in Spain. Protocol approval by the reference ethics 
committee for all the participating centers.
METHODS: Eligible patients started the extension trial on the tapentadol PR 
dosage optimized for them in the preceding trial; dose adjustments were 
permitted throughout the extension. Treatment effectiveness outcomes included 
changes in pain intensity, sleep, state of health, quality of life, patient and 
clinician global impression of change, and patients' satisfaction with 
treatment. Patients with OA knee pain also answered the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities OA index, and patients with LBP with a possible 
neuropathic pain component completed neuropathic pain-related questionnaires.
RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were enrolled: 40 with OA knee pain, 43 with LBP. 
The full analysis set consisted of 81 patients. Mean pain intensity remained 
relatively stable over the 72-week extension period with mean increases from 
baseline of 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.1,1.0; Numeric Rating Scale) 
for all patients, 0.2 (95% CI, -0.5, 0.9) for patients with OA, and 0.68 (95% 
CI, -0.2, 1.6) for patients with LBP. State of health and quality of life 
baseline ratings were maintained; overall impression of change was "improved." 
Most patients (88.9%) reported at least good treatment satisfaction at the end 
of treatment. Mean daily tapentadol PR doses slightly increased from 313.3 ± 
139.5 mg at baseline to 315.7 ± 140.1 mg at end of study. Uptitration was 
required for 8.4% of the patients, 4.8% had a dose reduction during the trial. 
Adverse events considered probably/likely or certainly related to tapentadol PR 
treatment by the investigator were documented for 18.1% of all patients, most 
commonly constipation (7.2%). Seven patients (8.4%) experienced adverse events 
leading to premature discontinuation.
LIMITATIONS: An open-label design, stable concomitant analgesics (World Health 
Organization step I), and dose adjustments were allowed during the study. All 
patients had benefitted from tapentadol PR in preceding trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Sustained pain relief and quality of life for up to 72 treatment 
weeks under relatively stable dosing, as well as the good safety profile, 
indicate the usefulness of tapentadol PR for patients who suffer from severe 
chronic OA knee pain and LBP with limited risk for tolerance development.

The discovery early in this century of the exceptional longevity of the 
Sardinian population has given new impetus to demographic studies of this 
phenomenon during the classical period. In the 1970s, it was hypothesised that 
the average mortality rate in Roman Sardinia was lower than in metropolitan Rome 
itself, postulating an ancient precedent for the remarkable longevity observable 
nowadays in the island's population. In the present study, the available 
evidence was examined in order to test this hypothesis. Literary, juridical, 
epigraphic, papyrological, anthropological and archaeological sources regarding 
the population of the Roman Empire, including Sardinia, were retrieved by 
accessing Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases, as well 
as regional libraries, regardless of time limitation, and were independently 
reviewed by the authors. For Roman Sardinia, only funerary epitaphs were 
retrieved, in contrast with the numerous sources available for the whole Roman 
Empire. Inscriptions revealing the existence of three alleged nonagenarians, two 
centenarians, two ultracentenarians and one supercentenarian were found, 
corresponding to 2% in a total of 381 inscriptions. The majority were located in 
a highly Romanised rural area of central-western Sardinia. However, the ages 
reported in the epitaphs may be inaccurate because of the influence of 
confounders such as age rounding, approximations and/or amplifications, and are 
unrelated to the total number of inhabitants. In conclusion, the funerary 
evidence, the only available data from Roman Sardinia, is too weak to estimate 
the life expectancy of the local ancient population and cannot offer valuable 
arguments to support the hypothesis that exceptional longevity has been a 
Sardinian trait since Roman times.

An estimated 58 million people have survived tuberculosis since 2000, yet many 
of them will suffer from post-tuberculosis lung disease (PTLD). PTLD results 
from a complex interplay between organism, host, and environmental factors and 
affects long-term respiratory health. PTLD is an overlapping spectrum of 
disorders that affects large and small airways (bronchiectasis and obstructive 
lung disease), lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature, and pleura and may be 
complicated by co-infection and haemoptysis. People affected by PTLD have 
shortened life expectancy and increased risk of recurrent tuberculosis, but 
predictors of long-term outcomes are not known. No data are available on PTLD in 
children and on impact throughout the life course. Risk-factors for PTLD include 
multiple episodes of tuberculosis, drug-resistant tuberculosis, delays in 
diagnosis, and possibly smoking. Due to a lack of controlled trials in this 
population, no evidence-based recommendations for the investigation and 
management of PTLD are currently available. Empirical expert opinion advocates 
pulmonary rehabilitation, smoking cessation, and vaccinations (pneumococcal and 
influenza). Exacerbations in PTLD remain both poorly understood and 
under-recognised. Among people with PTLD, the probability of tuberculosis 
recurrence must be balanced against other causes of symptom worsening. 
Unnecessary courses of repeated empiric anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy should be 
avoided. PTLD is an important contributor to the global burden of chronic lung 
disease. Advocacy is needed to increase recognition for PTLD and its associated 
economic, social, and psychological consequences and to better understand how 
PTLD sequelae could be mitigated. Research is urgently needed to inform policy 
to guide clinical decision-making and preventative strategies for PTLD.

The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases has increased greatly worldwide due 
to the rise in life expectancy. In spite of notable development in the 
understanding of these disorders, there has been limited success in the 
development of neuroprotective agents that can slow the progression of the 
disease and prevent neuronal death. Some natural products and molecules are very 
promising neuroprotective agents because of their structural diversity and wide 
variety of biological activities. In addition to their neuroprotective effect, 
they are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic 
effects and often serve as a starting point for drug discovery. In this review, 
the following natural molecules are discussed: firstly, kynurenic acid, the main 
neuroprotective agent formed via the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan 
metabolism, as it is known mainly for its role in glutamate excitotoxicity, 
secondly, the dietary supplement pantethine, that is many sided, well tolerated 
and safe, and the third molecule, α-lipoic acid is a universal antioxidant. As a 
conclusion, because of their beneficial properties, these molecules are 
potential candidates for neuroprotective therapies suitable in managing 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Age-related health issues have been increasing with the rise of life expectancy 
all over the world. One of these problems is cognitive impairment, which causes 
elderly people to have problems performing their daily activities. Detection of 
cognitive impairment at an early stage would enable medical doctors to deepen 
diagnosis and follow-up on patient status. Recent studies show that daily 
activities can be used to assess the cognitive status of elderly people. 
Additionally, the intrinsic structure of activities and the relationships 
between their sub-activities are important clues for capturing the cognitive 
abilities of seniors. Existing methods perceive each activity as a stand-alone 
unit while ignoring their inner structural relationships. This study 
investigates such relationships by modelling activities hierarchically from 
their sub-activities, with the overall goal of detecting abnormal activities 
linked to cognitive impairment. For this purpose, recursive auto-encoders (RAE) 
and their linear vs. greedy and supervised vs. semi-supervised variants are 
adopted to model the activities. Then, abnormal activities are systematically 
detected using RAE's reconstruction error. Moreover, to apply RAEs for this 
problem, we introduce a new sensor representation called raw sensor measurement 
(RSM) that captures the intrinsic structure of activities, such as the frequency 
and the order of sensor activations. As real-world data are not accessible, we 
generated data by simulating abnormal behaviour, which reflects on cognitive 
impairment. Extensive experiments show that RAEs can be used as a 
decision-supporting tool, especially when the training set is not labelled to 
detect early indicators of dementia.

The role of wheat, and particularly of gluten protein, in our diet has recently 
been scrutinized. This article provides a summary of the main pathologies 
related to wheat in the human body, including celiac disease, wheat allergy, 
nonceliac wheat sensitivity, fructose malabsorption, and irritable bowel 
syndrome. Differences in reactivity are discussed for ancient, heritage, and 
modern wheats. Due to large variability among species and genotypes, it might be 
feasible to select wheat varieties with lower amounts and fewer types of 
reactive prolamins and fructans. Einkorn is promising for producing fewer 
immunotoxic effects in a number of celiac research studies. Additionally, the 
impact of wheat processing methods on wheat sensitivity is reviewed. Research 
indicates that germination and fermentation technologies can effectively alter 
certain immunoreactive components. For individuals with wheat sensitivity, 
less-reactive wheat products can slow down disease development and improve 
quality of life. While research has not proven causation in the increase in 
wheat sensitivity over the last decades, modern wheat processing may have 
increased exposure to immunoreactive compounds. More research is necessary to 
understand the influence of modern wheat cultivars on epidemiological change.

BACKGROUND: Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) represent a 
heterogenous group of tumors. Findings from the phase III NETTER-1 trial showed 
that treatment of unresectable/metastatic progressive gastrointestinal (GI) NETs 
with 177Lu-Dotatate resulted in a significant improvement in progression-free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with best supportive care 
(BSC) with high dose octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) 60 mg. A health 
economic analysis was performed using input data from clinical studies and data 
derived from an indirect comparison to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
177Lu-Dotatate in the treatment of GI-NETs and pancreatic NETs (P-NETs) in 
Scotland.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the payer perspective 
using a three-state partitioned survival model. In the base case 177Lu-Dotatate 
was compared with BSC in gastrointestinal (GI)-NETs using clinical data from the 
NETTER-1 trial. A secondary analysis comparing 177Lu-Dotatate with BSC, 
everolimus or sunitinib in patients with P-NETs was also performed using hazard 
ratios inferred from indirect comparisons. The base case analysis was performed 
over a 20-year time horizon with an annual discount rate of 3.5% for both costs 
and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: For unresectable/metastatic progressive GI-NETs treatment with 
177Lu-Dotatate led to a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.33 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with BSC due to extended PFS and 
OS. Mean total lifetime costs were GBP 35,701 higher with 177Lu-Dotatate, 
leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 26,830 per QALY 
gained. In analyses in patients with P-NETs 177Lu-Dotatate was associated with 
ICERs below GBP 30,000 per QALY gained in comparisons with BSC, sunitinib and 
everolimus.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrated that, in Scotland, from 
the payer perspective, 177Lu-Dotatate at the set acquisition cost is a 
cost-effective treatment option for patients with unresectable or metastatic 
progressive GI-NETs or P-NETs.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the losses of quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) due to the joint effects of cognitive impairment and 
multimorbidity, and to further confirm additional losses attributable to this 
interaction among middle-aged and elderly Chinese people.
METHODS: The National Cause of Death Monitoring Data were linked with the China 
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). A mapping and assignment 
method was used to estimate health utility values, which were further used to 
calculate QALE. Losses of QALE were measured by comparing the differences 
between subgroups. All the losses of QALE were displayed at two levels: the 
individual and population levels.
RESULTS: At age 45, the individual-level and population-level losses of QALE 
attributed to the combination of cognitive impairment and multimorbidity were 
7.61 (95% CI: 5.68, 9.57) years and 4.30 (95% CI: 3.43, 5.20) years, 
respectively. The losses for cognitive impairment alone were 3.10 (95% CI: 2.29, 
3.95) years and 1.71 (95% CI: 1.32, 2.13) years at the two levels. Similarly, 
the losses for multimorbidity alone were 3.53 (95% CI: 2.53, 4.56) years and 
1.91 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.63) years at the two levels. Additional losses due to the 
interaction of cognitive impairment and multimorbidity were indicated by the 
0.98 years of the individual-level gap and 0.67 years of the population-level 
gap.
CONCLUSION: Among middle-aged and elderly Chinese people, cognitive impairment 
and multimorbidity resulted in substantial losses of QALE, and additional QALE 
losses were seen due to their interaction at both individual and population 
levels.

BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-induced Weight Gain (AiWG) is a debilitating and 
common adverse effect of antipsychotics. AiWG negatively impacts life 
expectancy, quality of life, treatment adherence, likelihood of developing 
type-2 diabetes and readmission. Treatment of AiWG is currently challenging, and 
there is no consensus on the optimal management strategy. In this study, we aim 
to evaluate the use of metformin for the treatment of AiWG by comparing 
metformin with placebo in those receiving treatment as usual, which includes a 
lifestyle intervention.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 
pragmatic trial with a follow-up of 52 weeks, we aim to include 256 overweight 
participants (Body Mass Index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2) of at least 16 years of age. 
Patients are eligible if they have been diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum 
disorder and if they have been using an antipsychotic for at least three months. 
Participants will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation to placebo or metformin, 
and will be treated for a total of 26 weeks. Metformin will be started at 500 mg 
b.i.d. and escalated to 1000 mg b.i.d. 2 weeks thereafter (up to a maximum of 
2000 mg daily). In addition, all participants will undergo a lifestyle 
intervention as part of the usual treatment consisting of a combination of an 
exercise program and dietary consultations. The primary outcome measure is 
difference in body weight as a continuous trait between the two arms from 
treatment inception until 26 weeks of treatment, compared to baseline. Secondary 
outcome measures include: 1) Any element of metabolic syndrome (MetS); 2) 
Response, defined as ≥5% body weight loss at 26 weeks relative to treatment 
inception; 3) Quality of life; 4) General mental and physical health; and 5) 
Cost-effectiveness. Finally, we aim to assess whether genetic liability to BMI 
and MetS may help estimate the amount of weight reduction following initiation 
of metformin treatment.
DISCUSSION: The pragmatic design of the current trial allows for a comparison of 
the efficacy and safety of metformin in combination with a lifestyle 
intervention in the treatment of AiWG, facilitating the development of 
guidelines on the interventions for this major health problem.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Previous studies of infectious diseases 
showed that infectious diseases not only cause physical damage to infected 
individuals but also damage to the mental health of the public. Therefore this 
study aims to analyze the factors that affected depression in the public during 
the COVID-19 pandemic to provide evidence for COVID-19-related mental health 
policies and to emphasize the need to prepare for mental health issues related 
to potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future.
RESULTS: This study performed the following statistical analyses to analyze the 
factors that influence depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
First, to confirm the level of depression in the public in each country, the 
participants' depression was plotted on a Boxplot graph for analysis. Second, to 
confirm personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals, 
a multi-level analysis was conducted. As a result, the median Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score for all participants was 6. The median was higher 
than the overall median for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay, suggesting 
a higher level of depression. In personal variables, depression was higher in 
females than in males, and higher in participants who had experienced 
discrimination due to COVID-19 than those who had not. In contrast, depression 
was lower in older participants, those with good subjective health, and those 
who practiced personal hygiene for prevention. In national variables, depression 
was higher when the Government Response Stringency Index score was higher, when 
life expectancy was higher, and when social capital was higher. In contrast, 
depression was lower when literacy rates were higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that depression was higher in participants living 
in countries with higher stringency index scores than in participants living in 
other countries. Maintaining a high level of vigilance for safety cannot be 
criticized. However, in the current situation, where coexisting with COVID-19 
has become inevitable, inflexible and stringent policies not only increase 
depression in the public, but may also decrease resilience to COVID-19 and 
compromise preparations for coexistence with COVID-19. Accordingly, when 
establishing policies such as social distancing and quarantine, each country 
should consider the context of their own country.

BACKGROUND: Health technology assessment (HTA) agencies have an important role 
in the evaluation and approval of new technologies. They determine their value 
within a health system so to promote equitable, quality care with available 
healthcare resources. Many HTA agencies have some mechanism for involving 
patients in their processes, but there is great variability and an absence of 
comprehensive, robust practices for involvement. The accelerating pace of 
medical innovation creates a need to improve the depth and breadth of patient 
involvement in the HTA process.
MAIN BODY: In this 'Call to action', we present ideas from three HTA expert 
commentaries calling for collaborative learning and to share innovative ideas 
for changes in HTA. We also draw on examples of HTA agencies creatively pursuing 
this goal. We propose a 'Call to action' for HTA stakeholders to undertake 
serious dialogue with patient advocates aimed at creating shared goals. HTA 
agencies can use these goals to ensure meaningful patient involvement at every 
step of the HTA process. Five elements are explored. In 'Recognizing the value 
of shared purpose', we highlight examples of HTA agencies that have patients 
working in partnership with medical practitioners and HTA staff. Results include 
improved processes that instil confidence. 'Committing to patient involvement as 
part of HTA culture' highlights several initiatives aimed at changes in HTA 
organisational culture to be more inclusive of patients. In 'Aligning patient 
and HTA goals' we cite work in Belgium and New Zealand which places a greater 
emphasis on quality of life rather than life expectancy and cost-effectiveness. 
By 'Integrating patient involvement at every step of the HTA process' patients 
can make vital contributions at every stage of the HTA process. We provide two 
examples of where HTA agencies have successfully involved patients early in the 
process in order to broaden the scope of evaluations. 'Developing a common 
language and working together' can support transformative dialogue through 
'unified language'.
CONCLUSION: The authors of this commentary ask that agencies and stakeholders 
involved in HTA take up this call to work together for visionary and 
transformative elevation of the voice of patients in HTA worldwide.

Objectives: In this paper, we assessed interdependent associations between 
food-related psychosocial traits and diet quality (ie, healthy and 
ultra-processed food consumption) among parent-adolescent dyads. Methods: This 
secondary analysis used data from the Family, Life, Activity, Sun and Health 
(FLASHE) study, which measured diet and other health behaviors in American 
parent-adolescent dyads (N = 1646). Actor-Partner Interdependence Models were 
used to apply a dyadic extension of the Theory of Planned Behavior and Social 
Determination Theory constructs (motivation, attitudes and self-efficacy) in 
relation to healthy and ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption. Results: Parent 
(b = 0.46, p < .01) and adolescent motivation (b = 0.42, p < .01) had positive 
actor effects on healthy food consumption. Parental attitudes had a negative 
actor effect (b = -0.20, p < .01) and adolescent attitudes had a positive actor 
effect (b = 0.34, p < .01) on healthy food consumption. Parent (b = -0.18, p < 
.01) and adolescent motivation (b = -0.14, p < .01) had negative actor effects 
on UPF consumption. No significant partner effects were found. Conclusions: 
Food-related psychosocial traits are associated with parent and adolescent diet 
quality. Interventions and guidelines that aim to strengthen an individual's 
ability to make healthful dietary choices, particularly those focused on 
reducing UPF consumption, are warranted, and may benefit from drawing on 
behavioral theories, especially those focused on motivational traits.

INTRODUCTION: Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 1 
(AIMP1) is a non-catalytic component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex that 
catalyzes the ligation of amino acids to their correct tRNAs. Bi-allelic 
truncating variants in the AIMP1 gene have been associated with hypomyelinating 
leukodystrophy-3 (HLD3; MIM 260600), which is characterized by hypomyelination, 
microcephaly, seizures and decreased life expectancy. Although peripheral nerve 
involvement has been assumed for HLD3, no compelling evidence is available to 
date.
CASE REPORT: The case was a first-born Filipino male. He showed profound 
developmental delay, failure to thrive, and spasticity in his limbs. At three 
months of age he developed refractory epilepsy. Serial magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRIs) showed profound myelination delay and progressive cerebral 
atrophy. He showed abnormal nerve conduction studies. Genetic testing revealed a 
homozygous pathogenic variant in the AIMP1 gene (NM_004757.3: c.115C > T: 
p.Gln39*). The parents were heterozygous for the same variant.
CONCLUSION: Here, we report a patient with a homozygous nonsense AIMP1 variant 
showing peripheral neuropathy as well as HLD3. Our case suggests that AIMP1 
plays a pivotal role in the peripheral nerve as well as the central nervous 
system.

INTRODUCTION: Ideally, health conditions causing the greatest global disease 
burden should attract increased research attention. We conducted a comprehensive 
global study investigating the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
published on different health conditions, and how this compares with the global 
disease burden that they impose.
METHODS: We use machine learning to monitor PubMed daily, and find and analyse 
RCT reports. We assessed RCTs investigating the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality from the Global Burden of Disease study. Using regression models, we 
compared numbers of actual RCTs in different health conditions to numbers 
predicted from their global disease burden (disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs)). We investigated whether RCT numbers differed for conditions 
disproportionately affecting countries with lower socioeconomic development.
RESULTS: We estimate 463 000 articles describing RCTs (95% prediction interval 
439 000 to 485 000) were published from 1990 to July 2020. RCTs recruited a 
median of 72 participants (IQR 32-195). 82% of RCTs were conducted by 
researchers in the top fifth of countries by socio-economic development. As 
DALYs increased for a particular health condition by 10%, the number of RCTs in 
the same year increased by 5% (3.2%-6.9%), but the association was weak 
(adjusted R2=0.13). Conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower 
socioeconomic development, including respiratory infections and tuberculosis 
(7000 RCTs below predicted) and enteric infections (9700 RCTs below predicted), 
appear relatively under-researched for their disease burden. Each 10% shift in 
DALYs towards countries with low and middle socioeconomic development was 
associated with a 4% reduction in RCTs (3.7%-4.9%). These disparities have not 
changed substantially over time.
CONCLUSION: Research priorities are not well optimised to reduce the global 
burden of disease. Most RCTs are produced by highly developed countries, and the 
health needs of these countries have been, on average, favoured.

Osteoarthritis is a painful, disabling condition which is increasing in 
prevalence as a result of an ageing population. With no recognized 
disease-limiting therapeutics, arthroplasty of the hip and knee is the most 
common and effective treatment for lower limb osteoarthritis, however lower limb 
arthroplasty has a finite life-span and a proportion of patients will require 
revision arthroplasty. With increasing life expectancy and an increasing 
proportion of younger (<65 years) patients undergoing arthroplasty, the demand 
for revision arthroplasty after implant failure is also set to increase. Statins 
are cholesterol-modulating drugs widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction 
which have been noted to have pleiotropic effects including potentially 
influencing arthroplasty survival. In vitro studies have demonstrated 
pleiotropic effects in human bone cells, including enhancement of 
osteoblastogenesis following simvastatin exposure, and in vivo studies have 
demonstrated that intraperitoneal simvastatin can increase peri-implant bone 
growth in rats following titanium tibial implant insertion. There is evidence 
that statins may also influence osseointegration, enhancing bone growth at the 
bone-implant interface, subsequently improving the functional survival of 
implants. Data from the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry and the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink in the UK suggest a reduction in the risk of lower 
limb revision arthroplasty in statin ever-users versus never-users, and a 
time-dependent effect of statins in reducing the risk of revision. In this 
article we review the clinical and experimental evidence linking statins and 
risk of revision arthroplasty.

The golden standard of treating Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) entails 
application of platinum-based chemotherapy, is often accompanied by Prophylactic 
Cranial Irradiation (PCI), which have been linked to neurotoxic side-effects in 
cognitive functions. The related existing neuroimaging research mainly focuses 
on the effect of PCI treatment in life quality and expectancy, while little is 
known regarding the distinct adverse effects of chemotherapy. In this context, a 
multimodal MRI analysis based on structural and functional brain data is 
proposed in order to evaluate chemotherapy-specific effects on SCLC patients. 
Data from 20 patients (after chemotherapy and before PCI) and 14 healthy 
controls who underwent structural MRI, DTI and resting state fMRI were selected 
in this study. From a structural aspect, the proposed analysis included 
volumetry and thickness measurements on structural MRI data for assessing gray 
matter dissimilarities, as well as deterministic tractography and Tract-Based 
Spatial Statistics (TBSS) on DTI data, aiming to investigate potential white 
matter abnormalities. Functional data were also processed on the basis of 
connectivity analysis, evaluating brain network parameters to identify potential 
manifestation of functional inconsistencies. By comparing patients to healthy 
controls, the obtained results revealed statistically significant differences, 
with the patients' brains presenting reduced volumetry/thickness and fractional 
anisotropy values, accompanied by prominent differences in functional 
connectivity measurements. All above mentioned findings were observed in 
patients that underwent chemotherapy.

Significance: Advancements in and access to health care have led to 
unprecedented improvements in the quality of life and increased lifespan of 
human beings in the past century. However, aging is a significant risk factor 
for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Hence, improved life expectancy has led to 
an increased incidence of NDs. Despite intense research, effective treatments 
for NDs remain elusive. The future of neurotherapeutics development depends on 
effective disease modification strategies centered on carefully scrutinized 
targets. Recent Advances: As a promising new direction, recent evidence has 
demonstrated that epigenetic processes modify diverse biochemical pathways, 
including those related to NDs. Small non-coding RNAs, known as microRNAs 
(miRNAs), are components of the epigenetic system that alter the expression of 
target genes at the post-transcriptional level. Critical Issues: miRNAs are 
expressed abundantly in the central nervous system and are critical for the 
normal functioning and survival of neurons. Here, we review recent advances in 
elucidating miRNAs' roles in NDs and discuss their potential as therapeutic 
targets. In particular, neuroinflammation is a major pathological hallmark of 
NDs and miR146a is a crucial regulator of inflammation. Future Directions: 
Finally, we explore the possibilities of developing miR146a as a potential 
biomarker and therapeutic target where additional research may help facilitate 
the detection and amelioration of neuroinflammation in NDs. Antioxid. Redox
