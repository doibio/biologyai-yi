BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a common health problem in 
office workers. In Germany, MSD (mainly back pain related) are the main cause of 
workdays lost to incapacity. This is not only bothersome for the employees, but 
also causes higher costs for the health system and employers. Workplace health 
promotion programmes (WHPP) can help to reduce this as they reach large target 
groups and are easily accessible. In this context, stretch training exercises 
have already proven to be effective. In the present study, a new approach 
focusing on trunk extension is to be investigated.
METHODS: To evaluate the training device "five-Business", 250 office workers 
will train two times a week for 3 months. The control group will consist of 100 
office employees. The device "five-Business" enables five different full body 
exercises. The intervention will be evaluated before week one and after week 
twelve via three assessments: a) the Short Form-36 (SF-36) to record the general 
health status and health-related quality of life, taking into account physical, 
psychological and social factors, b) the Nordic Questionnaire to evaluate 
complaints of the musculoskeletal system, c) Range of Motion (ROM) measurements 
using a digital inclinometer and a measuring tape respectively.
CONCLUSION: The "five-Business" combines elements of yoga and the McKenzie 
fundamentals, taking into account the Myers myofascial pathways in a highly 
torso-oriented, standardized stretching program. Due to the given exercise 
execution on the device and the individual adjustment possibilities of the 
stretching position (body size and range of motion) by the abutment, all 
exercises are individualized and standardized at the same time. In comparison to 
existing stretching interventions, this is a new approach in the framework of 
reducing musculoskeletal disorders and improving the quality of life in 
workplace health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Most patients with mild to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) experience exacerbations, which are also associated with 
increased healthcare costs. Despite limited evidence of antibiotics' benefits 
for exacerbations in outpatients, antibiotics are frequently prescribed. The aim 
of this study was to investigate whether doxycycline added to prednisolone is 
cost-effective compared to placebo plus prednisolone for the treatment of COPD 
acute exacerbations.
METHODS: An economic evaluation from the societal perspective was performed 
alongside a 2-year randomised trial in 301 COPD patients in the Netherlands. The 
primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The secondary 
outcome was cost per exacerbation prevented. Healthcare utilisation and loss of 
productivity were measured using retrospective questionnaires and clinical 
report forms. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputations by chained 
equations. Bootstrapping was employed to estimate statistical uncertainty 
surrounding cost-effectiveness outcomes. A sensitivity analysis from the 
healthcare perspective was performed.
RESULTS: On average, costs in the doxycycline group were €898 higher than in the 
placebo group [95% confidence interval (CI) - 2617 to 4409] for the 2 years of 
follow-up. QALY values were higher in the doxycycline group (0.03; 95% CI - 0.00 
to 0.06), but patients in this group suffered 0.01 more exacerbations than 
patients in the placebo group (95% CI - 0.14 to 0.11). Cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves showed that the probability of doxycycline being 
cost-effective compared to placebo was 61% and 43% at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €34,000 per QALY and per exacerbation avoided, respectively. The 
sensitivity analysis showed similar results from the healthcare system 
perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild to severe COPD treated for exacerbations in 
an outpatient setting, doxycycline added to prednisolone is not cost-effective 
compared to prednisolone plus placebo over a 2-year period.

BACKGROUND: The number of elderly patients suffering from esophageal cancer is 
increasing, due to an increasing incidence of esophageal cancer and increasing 
life expectancy. However, the effect of age on morbidity, mortality, and 
survival after Ivor Lewis total minimally invasive esophagectomy (TMIE) is not 
well known.
METHODS: A prospectively documented database from December 2010 to June 2017 was 
analyzed, including all patients who underwent Ivor Lewis TMIE for esophageal 
cancer in three Dutch high-volume esophageal cancer centers. Patients younger 
than 75 years (younger group) were compared to patients aged 75 years or older 
(elderly group). Baseline patient characteristics and perioperative data were 
included. Surgical complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo scale. The 
primary outcome was postoperative complications Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3. Secondary 
outcome parameters were postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality, 30- 
and 90-day mortality and survival.
RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-six patients were included, 357 in the younger 
and 89 in the elderly group. No significant differences were recorded regarding 
baseline patient characteristics. There was no significant difference in 
complications graded Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3 and overall complications, short-term 
mortality, and survival. Delirium occurred in 27.0% in the elderly and 11.8% in 
the younger group (p < 0.001). After correction for baseline comorbidity this 
difference remained significant (p = 0.001). Median hospital length of stay was 
13 days in the elderly and 11 days in the younger group (p = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: Ivor Lewis TMIE can be safely performed in selected elderly 
patients without increasing postoperative morbidity and mortality.

Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Ustekinumab, Infliximab, or Adalimumab for the 
Treatment of Moderate-Severe Crohn's Disease in Biologic-Naïve Patients.

Disease, USC/Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Ustekinumab was recently approved by the United States U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Crohn's disease. In this 
analysis, we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ustekinumab, infliximab, 
or adalimumab for the treatment of moderate-severe Crohn's disease in patients 
who failed conventional therapy (i.e., corticosteroids and immunomodulators) but 
were naïve to tumor necrosis factor antagonists (i.e., biologic drugs).
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a hybrid model structure (decision 
tree and Markov model).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A decision tree simulated biologic induction, and 
a Markov model simulated biologic and conventional therapy maintenance. Cycle 
length was 2 weeks with a discounted 5-year time horizon and a limited U.S. 
societal perspective in the base case; results from a payer perspective are also 
reported. Transition probabilities, direct costs, indirect costs, and utilities 
were obtained from the literature. To measure relative treatment value (i.e., 
order of treatment cost-effectiveness), net monetary benefits were reported for 
a $150,000 willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life-year in the 
base case. Infliximab dominated both adalimumab and ustekinumab, with a net 
monetary benefit (NMB) of $9943 and $29,798, respectively, in the base case. 
Adalimumab dominated ustekinumab, with an NMB of $19,855. All biologics yielded 
similar quality-adjusted life-years (~3.5), whereas costs varied substantially 
($50,510, $54,985, and $72,921 for infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab, 
respectively). The payer perspective, alternate time horizons, and scenario 
analyses consistently showed infliximab dominance. One-way, threshold, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results 
with respect to all parameters. Although biosimilars were not explicitly modeled 
as comparators, one-way sensitivity analysis showed that drug acquisition costs 
could alter relative treatment value but would have to be varied by at least 
50%.
CONCLUSION: For moderate-severe Crohn's disease, infliximab yields significantly 
more NMBs compared with both adalimumab and ustekinumab. Additional clinical 
(e.g., empiric dosing, biologic cycling) and quality-of-life (e.g., lost 
productivity, disutility of home injections) research is needed to allow for 
model frameworks and parameters that more accurately reflect the nuances of 
Crohn's disease treatment.

AIM: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of an intensification strategy 
with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (pathway 1) compared 
with NPH insulin (pathway 2) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the 
United Kingdom who were not at goal on metformin and sitagliptin.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the well-established, 
validated IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model from the payer perspective over a patient's 
lifetime. Randomized clinical trials informed treatment effect measures, while 
public or published sources informed economic inputs. Scenario analyses of 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), hypoglycaemia rate, body mass index effects, SGLT2 
inhibitor cardiovascular protective effects, and population characteristics were 
conducted to assess the robustness of results.
RESULTS: Pathway 1 increased life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
compared with pathway 2 (13.49 vs. 13.37, and 9.40 vs. 9.22, respectively). 
Additional drug costs in pathway 1 were offset by diabetes-related complication 
decreases, leading to slightly lower direct medical costs for pathway 1 (£25747 
vs £26095). Pathway 1 was therefore cost-neutral (no interpretable incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio), while improving clinical outcomes. Scenario analyses 
consistently showed cost-neutrality or cost-effectiveness of pathway 1. The 
highest result remained less than £3000/QALY, reflecting older patients 
(≥65 years) with lower baseline HbA1c (7%).
CONCLUSIONS: For UK patients with T2D not at goal on metformin and sitagliptin 
therapy, treatment intensification with SGLT2 inhibitors prior to NPH insulin is 
cost-neutral or cost-effective compared with immediate NPH insulin 
intensification.

A full Bayesian model to handle structural ones and missingness in economic 
evaluations from individual-level data.

Tropical Medicine, London, UK.

Economic evaluations from individual-level data are an important component of 
the process of technology appraisal, with a view to informing resource 
allocation decisions. A critical problem in these analyses is that both 
effectiveness and cost data typically present some complexity (eg, nonnormality, 
spikes, and missingness) that should be addressed using appropriate methods. 
However, in routine analyses, standardised approaches are typically used, 
possibly leading to biassed inferences. We present a general Bayesian framework 
that can handle the complexity. We show the benefits of using our approach with 
a motivating example, the MenSS trial, for which there are spikes at one in the 
effectiveness and missingness in both outcomes. We contrast a set of 
increasingly complex models and perform sensitivity analysis to assess the 
robustness of the conclusions to a range of plausible missingness assumptions. 
We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach with a second example, the PBS 
trial, and extend the framework to accommodate the characteristics of the data 
in this study. This paper highlights the importance of adopting a comprehensive 
modelling approach to economic evaluations and the strategic advantages of 
building these complex models within a Bayesian framework.

BACKGROUND: The results of the DIRECT trial, an RCT comparing conservative 
management with elective sigmoid resection in patients with recurrent 
diverticulitis or persistent complaints, showed that elective sigmoid resection 
leads to higher quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment at 1- and 5-year follow-up from a 
societal perspective.
METHODS: Clinical effectiveness and resource use were derived from the DIRECT 
trial. The actual resource use and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L™ score) were 
documented prospectively per individual patient and analysed according to the 
intention-to-treat principle for up to 5 years after randomization. The main 
outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as costs 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: The study included 106 patients, of whom 50 were randomized to surgery 
and 56 to conservative treatment. At 1- and 5-year follow-up an incremental 
effect (QALY difference between groups) of 0·06 and 0·43 respectively was found, 
and an incremental cost (cost difference between groups) of €6957 and €2674 
respectively, where surgery was more expensive than conservative treatment. This 
resulted in an ICER of €123 365 per additional QALY at 1-year follow-up, and 
€6275 at 5 years. At a threshold of €20 000 per QALY, operative treatment has 0 
per cent probability of being cost-effective at 1-year follow-up, but a 95 per 
cent probability at 5 years.
CONCLUSION: At 5-year follow-up, elective sigmoid resection in patients with 
recurring diverticulitis or persistent complaints was found to be 
cost-effective. Registration number: NTR1478 (www.trialregistrer.nl).

Template-Directed Catalysis of a Multistep Reaction Pathway for Nonenzymatic RNA 
Primer Extension.

Before the advent of polymerase enzymes, the copying of genetic material during 
the origin of life may have involved the nonenzymatic polymerization of RNA 
monomers that are more reactive than the biological nucleoside triphosphates. 
Activated RNA monomers such as nucleotide 5'-phosphoro-2-aminoimidazolides 
spontaneously form an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate that 
undergoes rapid nonenzymatic template-directed primer extension. However, it is 
unknown whether the intermediate can form on the template or only in solution 
and whether the intermediate is prone to hydrolysis when bound to the template 
or reacts preferentially with the primer. Here we show that an activated monomer 
can first bind the template and then form an imidazolium-bridged intermediate by 
reacting with a 2-aminoimidazole-activated downstream oligonucleotide. We have 
also characterized the partition of the template-bound intermediate between 
hydrolysis and primer extension. In the presence of the catalytic metal ion 
Mg2+, >90% of the template-bound intermediate reacts with the adjacent primer to 
generate the primer extension product while less than 10% reacts with competing 
water. Our results indicate that an RNA template can catalyze a multistep 
phosphodiester bond formation pathway while minimizing hydrolysis with a 
specificity reminiscent of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

BACKGROUND: Major depression is a prevalent mental disorder with a high risk of 
relapse or recurrence. Only few studies have focused on the cost-effectiveness 
of interventions aimed at the prevention of relapse or recurrence of depression 
in primary care.
AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a supported Self-help Preventive 
Cognitive Therapy (S-PCT) added to treatment-as-usual (TAU) compared with TAU 
alone for patients with a history of depression, currently in remission.
METHODS: An economic evaluation alongside a multi-center randomised controlled 
trial was performed (n = 248) over a 12-month follow-up. Outcomes included 
relapse or recurrence of depression and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) 
based on the EuroQol-5D. Analyses were performed from both a societal and 
healthcare perspective. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputations. 
Uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping and presented using the 
cost-effectiveness plane and the Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC). 
Cost estimates were adjusted for baseline costs.
RESULTS: S-PCT statistically significantly decreased relapse or recurrence by 
15% (95%CI 3;28) compared to TAU. Mean total societal costs were €2,114 higher 
(95%CI -112;4261). From a societal perspective, the ICER for relapse or 
recurrence was 13,515. At a Willingness To Pay (WTP) of 22,000 €/recurrence 
prevented, the probability that S-PCT is cost-effective, in comparison with TAU, 
is 80%. The ICER for QALYs was 63,051. The CEA curve indicated that at a WTP of 
30,000 €/QALY gained, the probability that S-PCT is cost-effective compared to 
TAU is 21%.
CONCLUSIONS: Though ultimately depending on the WTP of decision makers, we 
expect that for both relapse or recurrence and QALYs, S-PCT cannot be considered 
cost-effective compared to TAU.

The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera: 
Pentatomidae), is an invasive agricultural and nuisance pest that has 
established across much of the United States and caused significant crop losses 
in the Mid-Atlantic region. While it has been monitored extensively using 
ground-deployed pheromone traps, the vertical distribution of its life stages in 
the canopy of wild tree hosts has not been examined. In Virginia, small pyramid 
traps baited with 'low-dose' H. halys pheromone lures were deployed via a pulley 
system at the lower, mid-, and upper canopy of female tree of heaven (Ailanthus 
altissima (Mill.) Swingle) in 2016 and 2017 and male A. altissima and hackberry 
(Celtis occidentalis L.) in 2017. Weekly captures of adults and nymphs were 
recorded throughout each season. Each year, additional female A. altissima trees 
were felled during the two main periods of H. halys oviposition. The number and 
relative locations of all pentatomid egg masses found on foliage were recorded 
and any parasitoids that emerged from them were identified. Halyomorpha halys 
adults and nymphs were captured in greatest numbers in upper canopy traps and in 
lowest numbers in traps near the tree base. More H. halys egg masses were 
collected from mid-canopy than from the lower or upper canopy. The adventive egg 
parasitoid, Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), emerged 
most frequently from egg masses found at mid-canopy and was not recovered from 
those in the lower canopy. Results are discussed in relation to the foraging 
ecology of H. halys and its natural enemies, including TT. japonicus.

The road traumatism and its aftermath are global and increasing problem. In 2014 
Russia ranked first position in relation to number of deaths because of road 
accidents per one million of population among countries being members of the UN 
European economic commission. The purpose of study is to establish gender age 
characteristics and dynamics of burden of road traffic mortality in Russia. The 
non-clinical observation study was carried out covering years of life lost as a 
result of premature mortality due to road traffic accidents in Russia and 
standard of life expectancy on one-year age groups for males and females during 
2000-2012. In 2012, the age interval of 20-34 years covered 50% of total number 
of years of life lost because of road traffic accidents in males and 37% in 
females. During the analyzed period, decreasing of number of years of life lost 
per thousand males/females occurred in all age groups. The dramatic decreasing 
of rate of increase of losses during 2007-2009 ended in 2010 and their 
increasing began factually in all age groups. In case of males aged 15-19 years 
it was thus much significant that number of years of life lost per thousand of 
males in 2012 (29.8 years per thousand of males) factually returned to level of 
2000 (30.8 years per thousand of males).

OBJECTIVE: To determine threshold cytomegalovirus (CMV) infectious rates and 
treatment effectiveness to make universal prenatal CMV screening cost-effective.
STUDY DESIGN: Decision analysis comparing cost-effectiveness of two strategies 
for the prevention and treatment of congenital CMV: universal prenatal serum 
screening and routine, risk-based screening. The base case assumptions were a 
probability of primary CMV of 1% in seronegative women, hyperimmune globulin 
(HIG) effectiveness of 0%, and behavioral intervention effectiveness of 85%. 
Screen-positive women received monthly HIG and screen-negative women received 
behavioral counseling to decrease CMV seroconversion. The primary outcome was 
the cost per maternal quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with a 
willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: In the base case, universal screening is cost-effective, costing 
$84,773 per maternal QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, universal screening 
is cost-effective only at a primary CMV incidence of more than 0.89% and 
behavioral intervention effectiveness of more than 75%. If HIG is 30% effective, 
primary CMV incidence can be 0.82% for universal screening to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of universal maternal screening for CMV is 
highly dependent on the incidence of primary CMV in pregnancy. If efficacious, 
HIG and behavioral counseling allow universal screening to be cost-effective at 
lower primary CMV rates.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic differences in health and life expectancy are key 
issues for public health and health policy. In the course of demographic change, 
in addition to childhood, adolescence and middle adulthood, old age is 
increasingly becoming the focus of attention in research on health inequalities, 
with a special emphasis on the transition from working age to retirement.
OBJECTIVE: How do health inequalities change in the transition from middle to 
older age and then to very old age?
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article reviews the studies available for Germany, 
supplemented with new analyses based on the German Health Update study and the 
German Socioeconomic Panel study. In order to set the findings in the context of 
international research on health inequalities in old age, selected studies from 
other countries and international comparative studies are additionally 
considered.
RESULTS: Social differences in health and remaining life-expectancy also exist 
in older age, although to a slightly lesser extent than in middle age. There is 
evidence that as age progresses, health inequalities narrow in some health 
domains but there is also isolated evidence that health inequalities may widen 
with age.
CONCLUSION: The existence of health inequalities in old age indicates that older 
people from disadvantaged social groups have a particular need for healthcare 
and support. This poses special challenges for the medical, nursing and 
psychosocial care system as well as for the social security systems.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of disease for external causes of injury in 
the department of Casanare during the 2008-2012 period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study on the records of the 
events grouped as external causes of injury notified to SIVIGILA and the events 
reported to the Epidemiological Surveillance System of External Causes 
(SIVELCE). Analysis of time, place, and person variables through descriptive 
statistics, using templates available via WHO in Microsoft Office® Excel 2013 
and Epi-Info® 7.1.3.
RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, 5 829 cases grouped as external causes of injury 
were notified to SIVIGILA: 751 ophidic accidents (12.9%), 3 774 rabies attacks 
(64.7%), 1 231 poisoning cases (21.1%), 32 gunpowder injuries (0.5%), and 41 
cases of violence (0.7%), with a male/female ratio of 1:1, average age of 
25±19,3 (r=0.01-92), and 821 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (2. 5 years 
per 1 000 inhabitants). In turn, SIVELCE received 15 539 reports: 12 834 
intentional injuries (82.6%) and 2 704 unintentional injuries (17.4%), with a 
male/female ratio of 1:1, average age of 28±14.1 (r=0.03-90), correlation 
between dying by intentional injuries vs. unintentional injuries with an odds 
ratio of OR=0.12 (X2=1 060.56 1 g.l; p value=0.0), and DALY of 18 179 (55.8/1 
000).
CONCLUSIONS: The external causes of injury affect men and women equally; DALYs 
occur at the expense of morbidity. All external causes of injury are 
preventable; therefore, it is necessary to strengthen surveillance, prevention 
and control actions.

The study aimed to estimate the effect of health insurance on overall survival 
and disease-free survival in breast cancer patients undergoing surgery at the 
Las Américas Oncology Institute in Medellín, Colombia, with data from the 
institutional registry. The variables were compared between subsidized coverage 
and contributive coverage with chi-squared test (χ2) or Student t test, 
Kaplan-Meier, and log-rank test. The target variable was adjusted with Cox 
regression. There were 2,732 patients with a median follow-up of 36 months. Ten 
percent of the women with contributive coverage died, compared to 23% of the 
subsidized coverage group. There were differences in time-to-treatment 
(contributive group with 52 days versus subsidized group with 112 days, p < 
0.05). Disease-free survival and overall survival were better in women with 
contributive coverage compared to those with subsidized coverage (p < 0.05), and 
overall survival varied according to tumor and treatment variables. Overall 
survival and disease-free survival and early time-to-diagnosis and treatment 
were better in patients with contributive coverage compared to those with 
subsidized coverage.

Home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring and pharmacist case management reduce 
BP, but cost-effectiveness assessments are mixed. We examined the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of this intervention vs usual care in Canadians with 
cerebrovascular disease. A Markov decision model cost-utility analysis examining 
community-residing, high-risk patients with a recent nondisabling 
cerebrovascular event was created. A lifetime time horizon and health care payer 
perspective were used. Achieved BP, future cardiovascular risks, and attendant 
consequences on quality-adjusted life years and Canadian dollar costs were 
modeled. BP telemonitoring was assumed to occur for 3 months, then quarterly. 
Life tables were used to determine overall mortality, adjusted by cardiovascular 
disease mortality. Relative efficacies of intervention-associated BP lowering, 
resource use, and costs were obtained from Canadian published 
literature. Reduction in systolic BP of 9.7 mmHg was used in the base case; 
subsequently, robust sensitivity analyses were conducted. The results showed 
that, over the lifetime horizon, telemonitoring with case management led to net 
health care savings of $1929 Canadian and increased per-patient QALYs by 0.83. 
These findings were robust to sensitivity analysis, with the intervention 
remaining dominant or highly cost-effective. Increasing telemonitoring costs by 
50% still resulted in the intervention being dominant; if the costs of 
telemonitoring plus case management were 2-3 times base case cost, incremental 
cost-effectiveness was $1200-$4700 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In 
conclusion, home BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management poststroke 
lowered costs and improved QALYs. Strategies and funding for broad 
implementation of this dominant strategy should be implemented.

We propose that diagnostic tests should only be used when their results could 
affect treatment and prognosis of the diagnosed condition, taking costs into 
account. The cost-effectiveness of MRI has been evaluated in a randomised 
clinical trial in which 356 patients were divided over one group in which MRI 
was done within two weeks after experiencing trauma and one group that received 
standard care. No difference in QALYs was found between the groups. The number 
of referrals did not decrease in the MRI group, whereas costs for treatment 
increased. The point-of-care CRP-test for dealing with patients with acute cough 
presenting in daily general practice is one example of the opposite. CRP led to 
a decrease of antibiotic prescriptions and was found to be cost-effective. We 
conclude that more experts on diagnostics should be consulted in general 
practice and that diagnostic tests and procedures should receive attention in 
the medical curriculum and vocational training for general practice.

Background Children treated with cardiac catheterization procedures have now a 
long life expectancy and consequently potential long-term radiation-induced 
risks. We projected lifetime attributable risks (LARs) of cancer incidence from 
the most frequent procedures in pediatrics: atrial septal defect closure, patent 
ductus arteriosus occlusion, or pulmonary valvuloplasty. Methods and Results 
Organ equivalent doses were estimated for 1251 procedures performed in children 
aged ≤15 years at 2 reference catheterization centers in France from 2009 to 
2013. Sex-specific LARs were projected in lifelong nonsmokers using extended 
Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII risk models and 
considering various sources of risk projection uncertainties and dose 
variability (Radiation Risk Assessment Tool software). Median LARs ranged 
between 0.3 and 1.4 (atrial septal defect closure), 0.6 and 5.0 (patent ductus 
arteriosus occlusion), and 1.0 and 12.0 (pulmonary valvuloplasty) per 1000 
procedures, depending on patient sex and age at treatment. These 
radiation-related risks would represent 0.4% to 6.0% of children's total 
lifetime cancer risk. For the 10% of procedures (all types combined) with 
highest exposures, LARs reached 4.2 per 1000 (95% uncertainty interval, 
0.8-13.1) in boys and 22.2 per 1000 (95% uncertainty interval, 7.4-45.6) in 
girls. In boys, lung cancer accounted for 70% to 80% of the projected LARs, 
whereas in girls it accounted for 20% to 60% and breast cancer for 30% to 80% of 
the excess risks, depending on the type of procedure and patient age. 
Conclusions Radiation exposure may lead to substantial radiation doses and 
increased cancer risks in some cases. This suggests the need for dose reporting 
to support recommendations for long-term surveillance and prevention strategies 
when it is necessary.

The objective was to evaluate whether routine aspirin 75 mg is more 
cost-effective than the Fetal Medicine Foundation screen-and-treat approach for 
preeclampsia prevention in low-risk nulliparous women. A health economic 
decision analytical model was devised to estimate the discounted net health and 
cost outcomes of routine aspirin versus Fetal Medicine Foundation screening 
test-indicated aspirin for a cohort of 100 000 low-risk nulliparous women. Both 
strategies were compared with no intervention. A subanalysis also compared 
disaggregated components of the algorithm. The analysis used data from hospital 
administration, literature, and a randomized controlled trial. Sensitivity 
analyses assessed the impact of aspirin adherence, test cost, and accuracy on 
study results. Presumed rates of preeclampsia were 3.75% with no intervention 
versus 0.45% with aspirin use. Results found that routine aspirin was the 
preferred strategy, in terms of greater health gains and larger cost savings. It 
provided 163 quality-adjusted life-years relative to no intervention, whereas 
the screen-and-treat policy achieved 108 quality-adjusted life-years. Routine 
aspirin would result in an estimated cost saving of €14.9 million annually 
relative to no intervention, whereas screen-and-treat approach would result in a 
smaller cost saving of €3.1 million. When the analysis was extended to consider 
alternative screen-and-treat strategies, routine aspirin remained the optimally 
cost-effective approach. In conclusion, routine aspirin use in low-risk 
nulliparous women has a greater health gain and cost saving compared with both 
the Fetal Medicine Foundation and other screen-and-treat approaches.

Background and Purpose- Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are safer, at least 
equally efficacious, and cost-effective compared to warfarin for stroke 
prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) but they remain underused, particularly 
in demented patients. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of DOACs compared with 
warfarin in patients with AF and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods- We 
constructed a microsimulation model to estimate the lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness of anticoagulation 
therapy (adjusted-dose warfarin and various DOACs) in 70-year-old patients with 
AF and AD from a US societal perspective. We stratified patient cohorts based on 
stage of AD and care setting. Model parameters were estimated from secondary 
sources. Health benefits were measured in the number of acute health events, 
life-years, and QALYs gained. We classified alternatives as cost-effective using
