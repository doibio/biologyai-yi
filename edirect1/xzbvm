intellectual disability (PWID) are at risk for developing dementia.
OBJECTIVE: Since PWID are an often neglected patient population, the objective 
of this study was to investigate the prevalence of dementia in residential 
disability homes in Switzerland and to describe how residential homes organize 
dementia care.
METHODS: All residential homes for adults with disabilities in Switzerland 
(N = 437) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey. A subset of 
questions covered the number of residents with diagnosed and suspected dementia 
and the organization of dementia care. The response rate to the dementia-related 
questions was 32% (n = 140 care homes with 10403 residents).
RESULTS: In residential homes specialised in PWID, 5.8% of the residents were 
reported to have a diagnosed or suspected dementia. In 140 deaths of PWID, 26% 
(n = 37) died with a diagnosed or suspected dementia. Residential homes for PWID 
mostly rely on internal resources (67.7%), general practitioners (61.3%) or 
psychiatrists (45.2%) for the care of residents with dementia, while specialized 
dementia nurses are rarely involved (16.1%).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study in Switzerland to assess the prevalence of 
dementia in PWID. The study indicates a diagnostic gap. Dementia care is 
provided in a heterogeneous way across Swiss residential homes for people with 
disability. Since the number of PWID requiring such care will likely increase in 
the future, best-practice examples and guidelines are needed.

INTRODUCTION: Ivermectin 1% cream (IVM 1%) is indicated for the treatment of 
inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The objective of this subanalysis was to 
compare IVM 1% vs. metronidazole 0.75% cream (MTZ 0.75%) in the treatment of 
severe inflammatory lesions of rosacea.
METHODS: A subanalysis of the investigator-assessed severe subjects from a Phase 
3, investigator-blinded, randomized study comparing IVM 1% once daily (QD) with 
MTZ 0.75% twice daily (BID) over 16 weeks followed by a 36-week extension period 
was performed. Efficacy assessments were Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
and EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaires, investigator's global assessment 
(IGA), subject assessment of rosacea improvement, and inflammatory lesion 
counts. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study.
RESULTS: A total of 161 subjects (16.7% of overall study population; 80 IVM 1% 
and 81 MTZ 0.75%) had an IGA score of 4 at baseline representing severe 
papulopustular rosacea. Significantly more IVM 1% subjects had a minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID, defined as a decrease from baseline of 
≥4 points) in DLQI score than MTZ 0.75% subjects at week 16 (65.4% vs. 39.2%; 
P = 0.001) and week 52 (68.8% vs. 40.4%; P = 0.003). At week 16, the mean EQ-5D 
score for the IVM 1% subjects was higher (better quality of life) than for MTZ 
0.75% subjects (0.941 vs. 0.896). Significantly more IVM 1% subjects were IGA 
"clear" or "almost clear" at week 16 compared to MTZ 0.75% (82.5% vs. 63.0%; 
P = 0.005). Incidence of AEs was comparable between groups.
CONCLUSION: Better efficacy with IVM 1% cream (QD) compared to MTZ 0.75% cream 
(BID) contributes to an improved quality of life with significantly more 
patients achieving an MCID in DLQI score at week 16 and higher mean EQ-5D score. 
IVM 1% cream is thus a better alternative than MTZ 0.75% cream for severe 
papulopustular rosacea patients.

Cardiovascular anatomy and limited venous access may preclude the implantation 
of endocardial pacing systems in children as well as adults with congenital 
heart disease. Thus, the implantation of myo/epicardial pacing leads is required 
in these patients. The less favorable long-term results experienced in the past 
with myocardial screw-in leads are often used to justify the transvenous 
approach whenever possible, even in infants. However, encouraging preliminary 
results were reported from modern bipolar steroid eluting epicardial pacing 
leads. Further follow-up data are now warranted to obtain arguments for the 
dispute regarding the preferable or optimal pacing approach in infants and small 
children. Methods From January 1994 to November 2000 a total of 64 bipolar 
steroid-eluting epicardial pacing leads (Medtronic CapSure Epi 10366 and 4968, 
Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were implanted in 52 children at our 
institutions (52 electrodes in ventricular and 12 in atrial position). The 
median age of the children was 25.5 months (range 0.03 to 193 months). As part 
of a prospective multicenter study these leads were continuously followed in 
combination with AutoCapture devices since December 1996. Results Telemetry data 
demonstrated at discharge low pacing thresholds both for the ventricular 
(0.8±0.37Volt @ 0.5ms) and the atrial leads (0.8±0.4Volt @ 0.5ms) as well as 
excellent sensing signals (P wave 2.9±1.4mV and R wave 10.6±5.5mV) without 
significant changes during follow-up up to 24 months. AutoCapture controlled 
pacing could be applied in 46/52 (88%) children rendering a calculated battery 
service life of 14.8±2.9 years with a VVIR device (Regency SR 5130, St. Jude 
Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA) and 10.8±1.1 years with a dual chamber device 
(Affinity DR 5330, St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA). Apart from the necessity 
to reposition three leads in the immediate postoperative period no late lead 
related complications have been experienced during follow-up. Conclusions The 
new steroid-eluting bipolar epicardial pacing lead demonstrates a high 
reliability and consistent extraordinary pacing as well as sensing thresholds. 
AutoCapture controlled pacing is feasible in most patients and may result in 
marked battery service life extension. Hence epicardial pacing can now be highly 
recommended as the first choice for permanent pacing in infants and children.

Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is increasingly 
performed as an alternative to oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of treating OAC contraindicated patients with LAAC compared 
with aspirin alone.
METHODS: A probabilistic patient-level Markov microsimulation model with a 
lifetime horizon was performed to assess the discounted lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of LAAC 
compared with aspirin for patients with AF with contraindications to OAC. 
Baseline characteristics were based on a published multicenter Canadian LAAC 
experience. Clinical events included stroke, bleeding, myocardial infarction, 
and procedure-related complications. Event rates for stroke and bleeding were 
based on the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. The relative efficacies of LAAC 
and aspirin, as well as utility scores, were obtained from the published 
literature. Canadian procedural and long-term costs were obtained from the 
Ontario Case Costing Initiative and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term 
Care.
RESULTS: Aspirin was less effective than LAAC (4.25 ± 0.53 vs 4.66 ± 0.34 
quality-adjusted life years, respectively). The average discounted lifetime cost 
was CAD$30,748 ± 11,600 for LAAC and $38,974 ± 18,783 for aspirin. Thus, LAAC 
was dominant, being more effective and less expensive. Our results were robust 
with a relatively low degree of uncertainty, as LAAC was the preferred option in 
more than 90% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000.
CONCLUSIONS: LAAC is a novel stroke preventative therapy for nonvalvular AF and 
is a cost-effective alternative to aspirin in patients with contraindications to 
OAC.

Radiotherapy for iris metastasis from esophageal carcinoma: A series of three 
cases.

Das C(1), Shields CL(1).

Author information:
(1)The Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University, 
Philadelphia, PA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Description of three cases of metastatic esophageal carcinoma to the 
iris and focus on management strategies.
METHODS: A 48-year-old man (Case 1) with previously treated stage IV esophageal 
carcinoma presented with blurred vision in the left eye (OS) for 3 weeks. 
Initial fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was negative for malignant cells, 
so incisional biopsy was performed and confirmed metastatic carcinoma. A 
53-year-old man (Case 2) with previously treated stage III esophageal cancer 
experienced 2 months of pain and 1 month of blurred vision OS. Documented tumor 
growth suggested esophageal carcinoma metastasis. A 65-year-old man (Case 3) 
with previously treated stage IV esophageal carcinoma developed hyphema in the 
right eye (OD), and FNAB confirmed metastatic carcinoma.
RESULTS: Case 1 was treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), delivered 
over 16 days which resulted in complete tumor regression. Case 2 received 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) over 21 days leading to complete tumor 
regression. Case 3 was treated with plaque radiotherapy over 4 days, resulting 
in complete tumor regression.
CONCLUSIONS: In all three cases, radiotherapy was employed, and enucleation was 
avoided. Plaque radiotherapy achieved tumor control in a shorter period of time 
(4 days) compared to EBRT (16 days) or SBRT (21 days). Knowing the short life 
expectancy of these patients, plaque radiotherapy appears most favorable.

BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of type 2 
diabetes. Limited evidence exists regarding the effect of excess weight on years 
lived with and without diabetes. We aimed to determine the association of 
overweight and obesity with the number of years lived with and without diabetes 
in a middle-aged and elderly population.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study included 6,499 individuals (3,656 women) aged 55 
y and older from the population-based Rotterdam Study. We developed a multistate 
life table to calculate life expectancy for individuals who were normal weight, 
overweight, and obese and the difference in years lived with and without 
diabetes. For life table calculations, we used prevalence, incidence rate, and 
hazard ratios (HRs) for three transitions (healthy to diabetes, healthy to 
death, and diabetes to death), stratifying by body mass index (BMI) at baseline 
and adjusting for confounders. During a median follow-up of 11.1 y, we observed 
697 incident diabetes events and 2,192 overall deaths. Obesity was associated 
with an increased risk of developing diabetes (HR: 2.13 [p < 0.001] for men and 
3.54 [p < 0.001] for women). Overweight and obesity were not associated with 
mortality in men and women with or without diabetes. Total life expectancy 
remained unaffected by overweight and obesity. Nevertheless, men with obesity 
aged 55 y and older lived 2.8 (95% CI -6.1 to -0.1) fewer y without diabetes 
than normal weight individuals, whereas, for women, the difference between obese 
and normal weight counterparts was 4.7 (95% CI -9.0 to -0.6) y. Men and women 
with obesity lived 2.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 6.2) and 5.3 (95% CI 1.6 to 9.3) y longer 
with diabetes, respectively, compared to their normal weight counterparts. Since 
the implications of these findings could be limited to middle-aged and older 
white European populations, our results need confirmation in other populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in the middle aged and elderly is associated with a 
reduction in the number of years lived free of diabetes and an increase in the 
number of years lived with diabetes. Those extra years lived with morbidity 
might place a high toll on individuals and health care systems.

Years of Life Lost due to Premature Mortality in a Province with the Shortest 
Life Expectancy in Poland.

Poland.

AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate years of life lost for citizens of the 
Lodz Province, which is characterized by the lowest life expectancy in Poland, 
and to identify current trends in this area according to the most common causes 
of death.
METHODS: The study material included a database containing information gathered 
from 470,000 death certificates of Lodz Province inhabitants, who died between 
1999 and 2011. In order to calculate years of life lost, the authors applied the 
SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) and SEYLLd (per 
death) indices. The analysis of time trends was carried out with the application 
of joinpoint models.
RESULTS: The SEYLLp measure was 2,300 years per 10,000 males and 1,500 years per 
10,000 females in 2011. Cardiovascular diseases contributed to the highest 
number of years of life lost (SEYLLp=682 years per 10,000 males and 559 years 
per 10,000 females). Next were malignant neoplasms (SEYLLp=505 years per 10,000 
males and 437 years per 10,000 females), external causes of death (SEYLLp=361 
years per 10,000 males and 83 years per 10,000 females). The number of years of 
life lost due to acute myocardial infarction decreased most rapidly, the Annual 
Percent Change (APC) was -10.1% in males and -3.7% in females. However, heart 
failure contributed to the highest increase in the number of years of life lost 
(APC=10.8% in males and 10.9% in females).
CONCLUSIONS: A further decrease in the mortality rate due to cardiovascular 
diseases might contribute to the highest reduction of years of life lost. The 
most effective preventive activities are those aimed at reducing productive 
years of life lost due to a particular cause of death, i.e. road traffic 
accidents, suicides, cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic liver disease, and 
malignant neoplasms of the trachea, bronchi and lungs.

Despite myriad efforts among social scientists, epidemiologists, and clinicians 
to identify variables with strong linkages to mortality, few researchers have 
evaluated statistically the relative strength of a comprehensive set of 
predictors of survival. Here, we determine the strongest predictors of five-year 
mortality in four national, prospective studies of older adults. We analyze 
nationally representative surveys of older adults in four countries with similar 
levels of life expectancy: England (n = 6113, ages 52+), the US (n = 2023, ages 
50+), Costa Rica (n = 2694, ages 60+), and Taiwan (n = 1032, ages 53+). Each 
survey includes a broad set of demographic, social, health, and biological 
variables that have been shown previously to predict mortality. We rank 57 
predictors, 25 of which are available in all four countries, net of age and sex. 
We use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and assess 
robustness with additional discrimination measures. We demonstrate consistent 
findings across four countries with different cultural traditions, levels of 
economic development, and epidemiological transitions. Self-reported measures of 
instrumental activities of daily living limitations, mobility limitations, and 
overall self-assessed health are among the top predictors in all four samples. 
C-reactive protein, additional inflammatory markers, homocysteine, serum 
albumin, three performance assessments (gait speed, grip strength, and chair 
stands), and exercise frequency also discriminate well between decedents and 
survivors when these measures are available. We identify several promising 
candidates that could improve mortality prediction for both population-based and 
clinical populations. Better prognostic tools are likely to provide researchers 
with new insights into the behavioral and biological pathways that underlie 
social stratification in health and may allow physicians to have more informed 
discussions with patients about end-of-life treatment and priorities.

BACKGROUND: Bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer is associated 
with a poor prognosis and high morbidity. TRAPEZE was a two-by-two factorial 
randomised controlled trial of zoledronic acid (ZA) and strontium-89 (Sr-89), 
each combined with docetaxel. All have palliative benefits, are used to control 
bone symptoms and are used with docetaxel to prolong survival. ZA, approved on 
the basis of reducing skeletal-related events (SREs), is commonly combined with 
docetaxel in practice, although evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness is 
lacking. Sr-89, approved for controlling metastatic pain and reducing need for 
subsequent bone treatments, is generally palliatively used in patients unfit for 
chemotherapy. Phase II analysis confirmed the safety and feasibility of 
combining these agents. TRAPEZE aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness 
and cost-effectiveness of each agent.
METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive six cycles of docetaxel plus 
prednisolone: alone, with ZA, with a single Sr-89 dose after cycle 6, or with 
both. Primary outcomes were clinical progression-free survival (CPFS: time to 
pain progression, SRE or death) and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcomes were 
SRE-free interval (SREFI), total SREs, overall survival (OS) and quality of life 
(QoL). Log-rank test and Cox regression modelling were used to determine 
clinical effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from the NHS perspective 
and expressed as cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). An 
additional analysis was carried out for ZA to reflect the availability of 
generic ZA.
PATIENTS: 757 randomised (median age 68.7 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group scale score 0, 40%; 1, 52%; 2, 8%; prior radiotherapy, 45%); median 
prostate-specific antigen 143.78 ng/ml (interquartile range 50.8-353.9 ng/ml). 
Stratified log-rank analysis of CPFS was statistically non-significant for 
either agent (Sr-89, p = 0.11; ZA, p = 0.45). Cox regression analysis adjusted 
for stratification variables showed CPFS benefit for Sr-89 [hazard ratio (HR) 
0.845, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.99; p = 0.036] and confirmed no 
effect of ZA (p = 0.46). ZA showed a significant SREFI effect (HR 0.76; 95% CI 
0.63 to 0.93; p = 0.008). Neither agent affected OS (Sr-89, p = 0.74; ZA, 
p = 0.91), but both increased total cost (vs. no ZA and no Sr-89, respectively); 
decreased post-trial therapies partly offset costs [net difference: Sr-89 £1341; 
proprietary ZA (Zometa(®), East Hanover, NJ, USA) £1319; generic ZA £251]. QoL 
was maintained in all trial arms; Sr-89 (0.08 additional QALYs) and ZA (0.03 
additional QALYs) showed slight improvements. The resulting incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Sr-89 was £16,590, with £42,047 per QALY for 
Zometa and £8005 per QALY for generic ZA.
CONCLUSION: Strontium-89 improved CPFS, but not OS. ZA did not improve CPFS or 
OS but significantly improved SREFI, mostly post progression, suggesting a role 
as post-chemotherapy maintenance therapy. QoL was well maintained in all 
treatment arms, with differing patterns of care resulting from the effects of 
Sr-89 on time to progression and ZA on SREFI and total SREs. The addition of 
Sr-89 resulted in additional cost and a small positive increase in QALYs, with 
an ICER below the £20,000 ceiling per QALY. The additional costs and small 
positive QALY changes in favour of ZA resulted in ICERs of £42,047 (Zometa) and 
£8005 for the generic alternative; thus, generic ZA represents a cost-effective 
option. Additional analyses on the basis of data from the Hospital Episode 
Statistics data set would allow corroborating the findings of this study. 
Further research into the use of ZA (and other bone-targeting therapies) with 
newer prostate cancer therapies would be desirable.

Women exhibit greater morbidity than men despite higher life expectancy. An 
evolutionary life history framework predicts that energy invested in 
reproduction trades-off against investments in maintenance and survival. Direct 
costs of reproduction may therefore contribute to higher morbidity, especially 
for women given their greater direct energetic contributions to reproduction. We 
explore multiple indicators of somatic condition among Tsimane 
forager-horticulturalist women (Total Fertility Rate = 9.1; n =  592 aged 15-44 
years, n = 277 aged 45+). We test whether cumulative live births and the pace of 
reproduction are associated with nutritional status and immune function using 
longitudinal data spanning 10 years. Higher parity and faster reproductive pace 
are associated with lower nutritional status (indicated by weight, body mass 
index, body fat) in a cross-section, but longitudinal analyses show improvements 
in women's nutritional status with age. Biomarkers of immune function and anemia 
vary little with parity or pace of reproduction. Our findings demonstrate that 
even under energy-limited and infectious conditions, women are buffered from the 
potential depleting effects of rapid reproduction and compound offspring 
dependency characteristic of human life histories.

BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy for 
patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has led to mixed 
results in randomized trials, with an improvement in progression-free survival 
(PFS) but no statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit. Real-life 
data could help in assessing the value of this combination.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study aimed to describe the outcome following 
first-line paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in the French Epidemiological 
Strategy and Medical Economics (ESME) database of MBC patients, established in 
2014 by Unicancer. The primary and secondary end points were OS and PFS, 
respectively.
RESULTS: From 2008 to 2013, 14 014 MBC patient files were identified, including 
10 605 patients with a HER2-negative status. Of these, 3426 received paclitaxel 
and bevacizumab (2127) or paclitaxel (1299) as first-line chemotherapy. OS 
adjusted for major prognostic factors was significantly longer in the paclitaxel 
and bevacizumab group compared with paclitaxel [hazard ratio (HR) 0.672, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.601-0.752; median survival time 27.7 versus 19.8 
months]. Results were consistent in all supportive analyses (using a propensity 
score for adjustment and as a matching factor for nested case-control analyses) 
and sensitivity analyses. Similar results were observed for the adjusted PFS, 
favoring the combination (HR 0.739, 95% CI 0.672-0.813; 8.1 versus 6.4 months).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale, real-life setting, patients with HER2-negative 
MBC who received paclitaxel plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy had a 
significantly better OS and PFS than those receiving paclitaxel. Despite robust 
methodology, real-life data are exposed to important potential biases, and 
therefore, results need to be treated with caution. Our data cannot therefore 
support extension of current use of bevacizumab in MBC.

How Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Became a Contemporary Treatable Genetic Disease 
With Low Mortality: Shaped by 50 Years of Clinical Research and Practice.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common genetic heart disease 
encumbered throughout much of its almost 60-year history by a large measure of 
misunderstanding and the perception of a grim outcome without effective 
treatment options. However, it is now apparent that the majority of patients 
affected with HCM can achieve normal or near-normal life expectancy without 
disability, and usually do not require major treatment interventions. 
Nevertheless, for those patients with HCM who are at risk for (or experience) 
disease-related complications, a constellation of comprehensive nonpharmacologic 
management strategies have evolved over the last 15 years, altering the natural 
history and disease course for many, including implantable defibrillators, heart 
transplant, external defibrillation/therapeutic hypothermia, advances in 
surgical myectomy, and alcohol ablation. In particular, expanded contemporary 
risk stratification strategies have led to a more reliable selection of patients 
likely to achieve primary prevention of sudden death with implantable 
defibrillators. Most recently, large cohort studies using current management 
strategies and therapeutic measures have shown that it is now possible to 
achieve significantly improved survival with a low HCM-related mortality of 0.5% 
per year across all ages, and including children and young adults 
characteristically with the most aggressive disease course. These clinical 
management initiatives, instituted by the practicing cardiology community, have 
succeeded in preserving life and restoring an active lifestyle for thousands of 
patients with HCM, while providing many with a measure of reassurance and a 
reasonable expectation for an extended (if not normal) life span.

IMPORTANCE: The angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan 
was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality, all-cause 
mortality, and hospitalizations compared with enalapril. Sacubitril/valsartan 
has been approved for use in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction 
in the United States and cost has been suggested as 1 factor that will influence 
the use of this agent.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan vs 
enalapril in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from US adults (mean [SD] age, 63.8 
[11.5] years) with HF with reduced ejection fraction and characteristics similar 
to those in the PARADIGM-HF trial were used as inputs for a 2-state Markov model 
simulated HF. Risks of all-cause mortality and hospitalization from HF or other 
reasons were estimated with a 30-year time horizon. Quality of life was based on 
trial EQ-5D scores. Hospital costs combined Medicare and private insurance 
reimbursement rates; medication costs included the wholesale acquisition cost 
for sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril. A discount rate of 3% was used. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on key inputs including: hospital costs, 
mortality benefit, hazard ratio for hospitalization reduction, drug costs, and 
quality-of-life estimates.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalizations, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), costs, and incremental costs per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The 2-state Markov model of US adult patients (mean age, 63.8 years) 
calculated that there would be 220 fewer hospital admissions per 1000 patients 
with HF treated with sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril over 30 years. The 
incremental costs and QALYs gained with sacubitril/valsartan treatment were 
estimated at $35 512 and 0.78, respectively, compared with enalapril, equating 
to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $45 017 per QALY for the 
base-case. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated ICERs ranging from $35 357 to 
$75 301 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For eligible patients with HF with reduced ejection 
fraction, the Markov model calculated that sacubitril/valsartan would increase 
life expectancy at an ICER consistent with other high-value accepted 
cardiovascular interventions. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated 
sacubitril/valsartan would remain cost-effective vs enalapril.

OBJECTIVES: Once-daily insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) is the first 
basal insulin and glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist combined in one 
delivery device. Our aim was to investigate the cost effectiveness of IDegLira 
vs. basal insulin intensification therapies for patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus uncontrolled on basal insulin (glycosylated haemoglobin; HbA1c >7.5 %; 
58 mmol/mol) in a UK setting.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline cohort and clinical parameters were 
sourced from a pooled analysis comparing IDegLira with basal insulin plus 
liraglutide and basal-bolus therapy, and from the DUAL™ V trial comparing 
IDegLira with up-titrated insulin glargine (IGlar; Lantus(®)). The CORE Diabetes 
Model simulated lifetime costs and outcomes with IDegLira vs. these comparators 
from a UK healthcare payers' perspective. All costs were expressed in 2015 GBP. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of key parameters in 
the model.
RESULTS: Treatment with IDegLira resulted in mean increases in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) of 0.12, 0.41 and 0.24 vs. basal insulin plus liraglutide, 
basal-bolus therapy and up-titrated IGlar, respectively. IDegLira was associated 
with lower costs of £971 and £1698 vs. basal insulin plus liraglutide and 
basal-bolus therapy, respectively, and increased costs of £1441 vs. up-titrated 
IGlar. IDegLira was dominant, i.e., both more effective and less costly vs. 
basal insulin plus liraglutide and basal-bolus therapy, and highly cost 
effective vs. up-titrated IGlar with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
£6090/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily IDegLira may be considered a cost-effective treatment 
option for prescribers, to improve glycaemic control for type 2 diabetes 
patients uncontrolled on basal insulin without an increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia or weight gain, and without adding to their injection burden.

Detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) have been widely explored for biomedical 
applications ranging from cancer therapy to magnetic resonance imaging due to 
several promising properties. These include faceted surfaces that mediate potent 
drug binding and water coordination that have resulted in marked enhancements to 
the efficacy and safety of drug delivery and imaging. In addition, scalable 
processing of DNDs yields uniform particles. Furthermore, a broad spectrum of 
biocompatibility studies has shown that DNDs appear to be well-tolerated. Prior 
to the clinical translation of DNDs for indications that are addressed via 
intravenous administration, comprehensive assessment of DND safety in both small 
and large animal preclinical models is needed. This article reports the results 
of a DND biocompatibility study in both non-human primates and rats. The rat 
study was performed as a multiple dose subacute investigation in two cohorts 
that lasted for 2 weeks and included histological, serum, and urine analysis. 
The non-human primate study was performed as a dual gender, multiple dose, and 
long-term investigation in both standard/clinically relevant and elevated dosing 
cohorts that lasted for 6 months and included comprehensive serum, urine, 
histological, and body weight analysis. The results from these studies indicate 
that NDs are well-tolerated at clinically relevant doses. Examination of 
dose-dependent changes in biomarker levels provides important guidance for the 
downstream in-human validation of DNDs for clinical drug delivery and imaging.

BACKGROUND: Small fiber neuropathy is the most common cause of neuropathic pain 
in peripheral neuropathies, with a minimum prevalence of 53/100,000. Patients 
experience excruciating pain, and currently available anti-neuropathic and other 
pain drugs do not relieve the pain substantially. Several open-label studies 
have suggested an immunological basis in small fiber neuropathy and have 
reported efficacy of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Therefore, 
immunological mechanisms conceivably may play a role in small fiber neuropathy. 
To date, no randomized controlled study with intravenous immunoglobulin in 
patients with small fiber neuropathy has been performed.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
clinical trial in patients with idiopathic small fiber neuropathy. The primary 
objective is to investigate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin versus 
placebo on pain alleviation. A 1-point change in the PI-NRS compared to baseline 
is considered the minimum clinically important difference. In the IVIg-treated 
group, we assume a response rate of approximately 60 % based on the criteria 
composed by the IMMPACT group for measurement of pain. Based on this, a sample 
size of 60 patients is needed. Eligible patients fulfilling the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either intravenous 
immunoglobulin or placebo (0.9 % saline). The treatment regimen will start with 
a loading dose of 2 g/kg body weight over 2-4 consecutive days, followed by a 
maintenance dose of 1 g/kg body weight over 1-2 consecutive days given three 
times at a 3-week interval. The primary endpoint is the comparison of the 
percentage of responder subjects between the two treatment groups from the first 
randomization during the 12 weeks of treatment. A responder is defined 
as ≥ 1-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale improvement on the mean 
weekly peak pain relative to baseline. The secondary outcomes are pain 
intensity, pain qualities, other small fiber neuropathy-related complaints, 
daily and social functioning, as well as quality of life. In addition, safety 
assessments will be performed for adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory 
values outside the normal range. Responders during the 12-week treatment period 
will be followed during a 3-month extension phase.
DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial with intravenous immunoglobulin in patients with idiopathic small 
fiber neuropathy. Positive findings will result in a new treatment option for 
small fiber neuropathy and support an immunological role in this condition.

Alcohol consumption and burden of disease in the Americas in 2012: implications 
for alcohol policy.

Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Kevin.david.shield@gmail.com.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the volume and patterns of alcohol consumption up to and 
including 2012, and to estimate the burden of disease attributable to alcohol 
consumption as measured in deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
lost in the Americas in 2012.
METHODS: Measures of alcohol consumption were obtained from the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH). The 
burden of alcohol consumption was estimated in both deaths and DALYs lost based 
on mortality data obtained from WHO, using alcohol-attributable fractions. 
Regional groupings for the Americas were based on the WHO classifications for 
2004 (according to child and adult mortality).
RESULTS: Regional variations were observed in the overall volume of alcohol 
consumed, the proportion of the alcohol market attributable to unrecorded 
alcohol consumption, drinking patterns, prevalence of drinking, and prevalence 
of heavy episodic drinking, with inhabitants of the Americas consuming more 
alcohol (8.4 L of pure alcohol per adult in 2012) compared to the world average. 
The Americas also experienced a high burden of disease attributable to alcohol 
consumption (4.7% of all deaths and 6.7% of all DALYs lost), especially in terms 
of injuries attributable to alcohol consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol is consumed in a harmful manner in the Americas, leading to 
a high burden of disease, especially in terms of injuries. New cost-effective 
alcohol policies, such as increasing alcohol taxation, increasing the minimum 
legal age to purchase alcohol, and decreasing the maximum legal blood alcohol 
content while driving, should be implemented to decrease the harmful consumption 
of alcohol and the resulting burden of disease.

Survivors' quality of life after cardiopulmonary resuscitation: an integrative 
review of the literature.

of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
continues to increase worldwide largely due to greater awareness of the symptoms 
of cardiac events and increased attention to cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
training in the community. Globally, predicted survival rates after 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation have remained at 10% for decades and although 
patient outcome remains unpredictable, there is a positive trend in life 
expectancy. For a resuscitation attempt to be classed as successful, not only 
survival but also quality of life has to be evaluated.
AIM: The aim of this review was to examine literature that explores the quality
