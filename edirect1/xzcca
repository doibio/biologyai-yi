plot, I 2 statistics, and chi-square test with a statistical P value of less 
than 0.10 to indicate statistical significance. Random-effect models were used 
in case of moderate heterogeneity. Four studies were included for the review and 
two for meta-analysis. Two studies in 177 patients comparing quality of life 
with mini or standard diameter implants showed a pooled result of -4.76 [-6.48, 
-3.04] favoring the use of mini-implants. The results for other outcomes were 
incomputable due to inadequate studies. GRADE approach was used for quality of 
life, and the strength of evidence was observed to be "low". 
Mini-implant-supported overdentures had better patient satisfaction levels 
compared to standard diameter implant overdenture. There is definite lack of 
evidence to support the use of mini-implants for overdentures.

The global cancer burden and human development: A review.

France.

AIMS: This review examines the links between human development and cancer 
overall and for specific types of cancer, as well as cancer-related risk-factors 
and outcomes, such as disability and life expectancy.
METHODS: To assess human development, the Human Development Index was utilized 
continuously and according to four levels (low, medium, high, very high), where 
the low and very high categories include the least and most developed countries, 
respectively. All studies that assessed aspects of the global cancer burden 
using this measure were reviewed.
RESULTS: Although the present cancer incidence burden is greater in higher Human 
Development Index countries, a greater proportion of the global mortality burden 
is observed in less developed countries, with a higher mean fatality rate in the 
latter countries. Further, the future cancer burden is expected to 
disproportionally affect less developed regions; in particular, it has been 
estimated that low and medium Human Development Index countries will experience 
a 100% and 81% increase in cancer incidence from 2008 to 2030, respectively. 
Disparities were also observed in risk factors and average health outcomes, such 
as a greater number of years of life lost prematurely and fewer cancer-related 
gains in life expectancy observed in lower versus higher Human Development Index 
settings.
CONCLUSIONS: From a global perspective, there remain clear disparities in the 
cancer burden according to national Human Development Index scores. 
International efforts are needed to aid countries in social and economic 
transition in order to efficiently plan, implement and evaluate cancer control 
initiatives as a means to reduce the widening gap in cancer occurrence and 
survival worldwide.

OBJECTIVES: In the past decade, there has been a growing interest in health 
technology disinvestment. A disinvestment process should involve all relevant 
stakeholders to identify and deliver the most effective, safe, and 
cost-effective healthcare interventions. The aim of the present study was to 
describe the state of the art of health technology disinvestment around the 
world and to identify parameters that could be associated with the 
implementation of disinvestment programs.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed from database 
inception to November 2014, together with the collection of original data on 
socio-economic indicators from forty countries.
RESULTS: Overall, 1,456 records (1,199 from electronic databases and 257 from 
other sources) were initially retrieved. After analyzing 172 full text articles, 
38 papers describing fifteen disinvestment programs/experiences in eight 
countries were included. The majority (12/15) of disinvestment programs began 
after 2006. As expected, these programs were more common in developed countries, 
63 percent of which had a Beveridge model healthcare system. The univariate 
analysis showed that countries with disinvestment programs had a significantly 
higher level of Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product per capita, 
public expenditure on health and social services, life expectancy at birth and a 
lower level of infant mortality rate, and of perceived corruption. The existence 
of HTA agencies in the country was a strong predictor (p = .034) for the 
development of disinvestment programs.
CONCLUSIONS: The most significant variables in the univariate analysis were 
connected by a common factor, potentially related to the overall development 
stage of the country.

OBJECTIVES: Although the use of the right internal thoracic artery (RITA) as 
second arterial conduit to graft the left coronary system consistently has been 
shown to provide a survival benefit compared with the saphenous vein graft 
(SVG), the choice of conduit for the right coronary artery (RCA) system remains 
controversial. We compared long-term (>15 years) survival in patients who 
underwent RITA-RCA versus SVG-RCA grafting at a single institution.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 7223 patients undergoing coronary 
artery bypass graft surgery. Of them 245 (3.4%) and 6978 (96.6%) received 
RITA-RCA and SVG-RCA graft, respectively. Propensity score matching and 
time-segmented Cox regression were used to compare the 2 groups.
RESULTS: Survival probability at 5, 10, and 15 years were 95.9% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 93.4-98.4) versus 96.0% (95% CI, 94.3-97.8), 89.8% (95% CI, 
85.9-93.7) versus 88.0% (95% CI, 85.0-91.0) and 82.9% (95% CI, 77.6-88.2) versus 
76.3 (95% CI, 72.0-80.5) in the RITA-RCA and SVG-RCA group, respectively. 
Time-segmented Cox regression showed that during the first 9 years, the 
2 strategies were associated with comparable risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.13; 
95% confidence interval, 0.67-1.90; P = .65) but beyond 9 years, the RITA-RCA 
was associated with a significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.22-0.84; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization of the RCA system with the RITA was associated 
with superior late survival compared with SVG. This supports the view that, the 
use of RITA to graft the RCA should be encouraged, especially in patients with 
long life expectancy.

PURPOSE: To introduce the "on-top plasty" technique and report our long-term 
outcomes.
METHODS: We evaluated 5 thumbs in 5 patients who underwent radial polydactyly 
reconstruction using the "on-top plasty" technique between 1998 and 2003. This 
technique was used when it was felt that neither thumb possessed adequate 
proximal and distal structures to provide a functional and aesthetically 
pleasing thumb. Our study group included 1 Flatt type III and 4 Flatt type VII 
thumbs. The average age at time of surgery was 1.4 years and at final follow-up 
was 13.5 years. Subjective patient evaluation, objective outcomes values, and 
validated patient-oriented outcome measures were obtained.
RESULTS: There was no soft tissue loss and union was achieved in all thumbs with 
no further surgery required in any thumb. Mean flexion-extension arc for the 
metacarpophalangeal joint was 60° (range, 10° extension to 70° flexion) and at 
the interphalangeal joint was 19° (range, 25° extension to 35° flexion). Mean 
percentage of age-matched norms for lateral, tripod, and tip pinch were 47.0%, 
45.9%, and 47.8%, respectively. Mean grip strength was 54.2% of age-matched 
norm. The mean Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) score for parent 
questionnaires was 89.0 and for teen/child questionnaires was 89.1. The 
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire revealed a mean 
score of 4.3.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with radial polydactyly in which neither thumb 
possesses adequate distal and proximal components, the on-top plasty is a 
reliable method of polydactyly reconstruction with durable results at longer 
than 10 years' follow-up.

INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have shown that economic crises are linked to a 
worsening of health conditions of the population. During the current economic 
crisis in Spain, there have been significant cuts in social and health services 
and a general worsening of the emotional well-being of the population. All these 
changes could have an impact on the health of the population, especially in the 
most vulnerable groups like older people.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The evolution of life expectancy and healthy life years in 
the period 2004-2014 have been examined in order to examine the health status of 
people aged 65 years and over in Spain during the economic crisis.
RESULTS: Changes are observed in the evolution of healthy life years of people 
aged 65 years and over, particularly in the case of women.
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not show that the current economic crisis has had a 
negative impact on the health conditions of older people in Spain, but there has 
been a decline in their well-being and quality of life.

OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass has become an established 
treatment option for symptomatic aortoiliac obstructive disease at dedicated 
centers. Minimally invasive surgical techniques like laparoscopic surgery have 
often been shown to reduce expenses and increase patients' health-related 
quality of life. The main objective of our study was to measure quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) and costs after totally laparoscopic and open aortobifemoral 
bypass.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a within trial analysis in a larger ongoing 
randomized controlled prospective multicenter trial, Norwegian Laparoscopic 
Aortic Surgery Trial. Fifty consecutive patients suffering from symptomatic 
aortoiliac occlusive disease suitable for aortobifemoral bypass surgery were 
randomized to either totally laparoscopic (n=25) or open surgical procedure 
(n=25). One patient dropped out of the study before surgery. We measured 
health-related quality of life using the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire at 4 
different time points, before surgery and for 6 months during follow-up. We 
calculated the QALYs gained by using the area under the curve for both groups. 
Costs were calculated based on prices for surgical equipment, vascular 
prosthesis and hospital stay.
RESULTS: We found a significantly higher increase in QALYs after laparoscopic vs 
open aortobifemoral bypass surgery, with a difference of 0.07 QALYs, (p=0.001) 
in favor of laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass. The total cost of surgery, 
equipment and hospital stay after laparoscopic surgery (9,953 €) was less than 
open surgery (17,260 €), (p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass seems to be cost-effective 
compared with open surgery, due to an increase in QALYs and lower 
procedure-related costs.

With the increase in the proportion of aged population due to the rapid increase 
of life expectancy, the worldwide prevalence rate of multiple neurodegenerative 
diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's 
disease has been increased dramatically. The demographic trend toward an older 
population has drawn the attention to new drug discovery and treatment on 
age-related diseases. Although a panel of drugs and/or therapies are currently 
available for treating the neurodegenerative diseases, side effects or 
insufficient drug efficacy have been reported. With the long history in 
prescription of Chinese medicine or natural compounds for modulating 
aged-related diseases, emerging evidence was reported to support the 
pharmacological role of Chinese medicine in ameliorating the symptoms, or 
interfering with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. This 
review brings evidence about today's trends and development of a list of 
potential neuroprotective herbal compounds from both the traditional and modern 
pharmacological point of view. With future projections, the potential hope and 
implication of using Chinese medicine as an alternative source for novel drug 
discovery for neurodegenerative diseases is proposed.

BACKGROUND: Cause-specific (CS) and net survival in a relative survival 
framework (RS) are two of the most common methods for estimating cancer 
survival. In this paper, we assess the differences in results produced by two 
permutations of cause-specific and relative survival applied to estimating 
cancer survival and disparities in cancer survival, using data from First 
Nations and non-Aboriginal populations in Canada.
METHODS: Subjects were members of the 1991 Canadian Census Mortality Cohort, a 
population-based cohort of adult respondents to the 1991 Long Form Census who 
have been followed up for incident cancers and death through linkage to 
administrative databases. We compared four methods: relative survival analyses 
with ethnicity-specific life tables (RS-ELT); relative survival with general 
population life tables (RS-GLT); cause-specific survival with a broad definition 
of cancer death (CS-Broad); and cause-specific survival with a narrow definition 
of cause of death (CS-Narrow) and applied these to the nine most common cancers 
among First Nations.
RESULTS: Apart from breast and prostate cancers, RS-ELT, RS-GLT, and CS-Broad 
tended to produce similar estimates of age-standardized five-year survival, 
whereas CS-Narrow yielded higher estimates of survival. CS-Narrow estimates were 
particularly unlike those based on the other methods for cancers of the 
digestive and respiratory tracts. Estimates of disparities in survival were 
generally comparable across the four methods except for breast and prostate 
cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer surveillance efforts in sub-populations defined by race, 
ethnicity, geography, socioeconomic status, or similar factors are necessary for 
identifying disparities and monitoring progress toward reducing them. In the 
absence of routine monitoring of cancer survival and cancer survival disparities 
in these populations, estimates generated by different methods will inevitably 
be compared over time and across populations. In this study, we demonstrate that 
caution should be exercised in making these comparisons, particularly in 
interpreting cause-specific survival rates with an unknown or narrow definition 
of cancer death and in estimates of breast and prostate cancer survival and/or 
disparities in survival generated by different methods.

Chronic myeloid leukemia is increasingly viewed as a chronic illness; most 
patients have a life expectancy close to that of the general population. Despite 
progress made using BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), drug resistance 
via BCR-ABL1-dependent and BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms continues to be an 
issue. BCR-ABL1-dependent resistance is primarily mediated through oncoprotein 
kinase domain mutations and usually results in overt resistance to TKIs. 
However, BCR-ABL1-independent resistance in the setting of effective BCR-ABL1 
inhibition is recognized as a major contributor to minimal residual disease. 
Efforts to eradicate persistent leukemic stem cells have focused on combination 
therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze outcomes and predictors of functional survival (personal 
care home admission and mortality) and hospital readmission in patients aged 
≥80 years who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in a Manitoba 
hospital.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients aged ≥80 years who 
underwent SAVR with or without coronary artery bypass grafting in Manitoba 
between 1995 and 2014. Data from the Manitoba Adult Cardiac Surgery database and 
the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy were used. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 
outcomes and Cox multivariate regression analysis of risk factors were 
performed. Survival was compared with that of age- and sex-matched life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: A total of 1872 patients were aged ≥50 years and 378 were aged 
≥80 years, 55% of whom (n = 208) underwent concurrent coronary artery bypass 
grafting. Compared with younger patients, octogenarians had higher in-hospital 
mortality (8.5%; P <.001), longer median intensive care unit stay (47.2 hours; P 
<.001), and longer median in-hospital stay (13 days; P <.001). The median 
follow-up was 5.2 years. Functional survival was 82.4% at 1 year and 56.5% at 
5 years, and freedom from hospital readmission was 61.5% at 1 year and 28.4% at 
5 years. Survival approximated the age- and sex-matched life expectancy at 
1 year (83.8%) and 5 years (60.8%). Preoperative atrial fibrillation, peripheral 
vascular disease, female sex, postoperative acute kidney injury, and blood 
transfusion were associated with adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In eligible octogenarians, SAVR has acceptable 1- and 5-year 
functional survival and hospital readmission rates, but significant 
perioperative mortality and morbidity.

The nonenzymatic copying of RNA templates with imidazole-activated nucleotides 
is a well-studied model for the emergence of RNA self-replication during the 
origin of life. We have recently discovered that this reaction can proceed 
through the formation of an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate that 
reacts rapidly with the primer. To gain insight into the relationship between 
the structure of this intermediate and its reactivity, we cocrystallized an RNA 
primer-template complex with a close analog of the intermediate, the 
triphosphate-bridged guanosine dinucleotide GpppG, and solved a high-resolution 
X-ray structure of the complex. The structure shows that GpppG binds the RNA 
template through two Watson-Crick base pairs, with the primer 3'-hydroxyl 
oriented to attack the 5'-phosphate of the adjacent G residue. Thus, the GpppG 
structure suggests that the bound imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide intermediate 
would be preorganized to react with the primer by in-line SN2 substitution. The 
structures of bound GppG and GppppG suggest that the length and flexibility of 
the 5'-5' linkage are important for optimal preorganization of the complex, 
whereas the position of the 5'-phosphate of bound pGpG explains the slow rate of 
oligonucleotide ligation reactions. Our studies provide a structural 
interpretation for the observed reactivity of the imidazolium-bridged 
dinucleotide intermediate in nonenzymatic RNA primer extension.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent in schizophrenia and is one of 
the main factors contributing to the significantly decreased life expectancy in 
this population. Schizophrenia smokers, compared to their counterparts with no 
comorbid psychiatric disorder, are largely unaware and indifferent to the 
long-term negative consequences of cigarette smoking. The objective of this 
study was to determine, for the first time, if these meta-cognitive deficits are 
associated with neuro-functional alterations in schizophrenia smokers.
METHODS: Twenty-four smokers with no psychiatric disorder and 21 smokers with 
schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance 
imaging and exposed to anti-smoking images. Granger causality analyses were used 
to examine the effective connectivity between brain regions found to be 
significantly activated.
RESULTS: Across groups, potent activations were observed in the left 
ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, the left amygdala (AMG), and the dorsomedial 
prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Using the dmPFC as a seed region, we found an 
abnormal negative connectivity from the dmPFC to the AMG in schizophrenia 
smokers during the viewing of anti-smoking stimuli. This abnormal connectivity 
was not present during the viewing of aversive stimuli unrelated to tobacco.
DISCUSSION: Given the well-established roles of the dmPFC in social cognition 
and of the AMG in emotional processing, our results suggest that the relative 
indifference of schizophrenia smokers regarding the negative consequences of 
tobacco smoking could be explained by a cognitive-affective dissonance.

PURPOSE: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) refers to the depression that 
occurs during the premenstrual phase and remits soon after the onset of menses. 
It affects the quality of life (QOL) of patients with PMDD. Therefore, this 
preliminary survey from chart recordings aimed to understand the symptom 
appearance and QOL reduction patterns in patients with PMDD, and to examine the 
extent of the loss of their quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
METHODS: Participants were 66 untreated female patients with PMDD. Data on 
symptom appearance and QOL reduction during the menstrual cycle, and the 
EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) scores during the premenstrual phase and immediately after 
the completion of a menstrual period were collected.
RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D score of the 66 patients with PMDD was 0.795 ± 0.120 
(range 0.362-0.949), indicating that their expected mean loss of QALYs was about 
0.14 years.
CONCLUSIONS: If untreated, PMDD is expected to cause a mean loss of QALYs of 
about 0.14 years. However, on accounting for the period from disease development 
to menopause, and subtracting the menstruation-free periods such as pregnancy 
and breastfeeding, patients with untreated PMDD are expected to experience a 
QALY loss of about 3 years during their lifetime.

Life-long lack of growth hormone (GH) action can produce remarkable extension of 
longevity in mice. Here we report that GH treatment limited to a few weeks 
during development influences the lifespan of long-lived Ames dwarf and normal 
littermate control mice in a genotype and sex-specific manner. Studies in a 
separate cohort of Ames dwarf mice show that this short period of the GH 
exposure during early development produces persistent phenotypic, metabolic and 
molecular changes that are evident in late adult life. These effects may 
represent mechanisms responsible for reduced longevity of dwarf mice exposed to 
GH treatment early in life. Our data suggest that developmental programming of 
aging importantly contributes to (and perhaps explains) the well documented 
developmental origins of adult disease.

Although recent studies demonstrated that fulvestrant is superior to anastrozole 
as first-line treatment for hormone receptor (HR)-positive advanced breast 
cancer, the cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant versus anastrozole remained 
uncertain. Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
fulvestrant compared with anastrozole in the first-line setting. A Markov model 
consisting of three health states (stable, progressive and dead) was constructed 
to simulate a hypothetical cohort of patients with HR-positive advanced breast 
cancer. Costs were calculated from a Chinese societal perspective. Health 
outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was expressed as incremental cost per QALY 
gained. Model results suggested that fulvestrant provides an additional 
effectiveness gain of 0.11 QALYs at an incremental cost of $32,654 compared with 
anastrozole, resulting in an ICER of $296,855/QALY exceeding the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $23,700/QALY. Hence, fulvestrant is not a 
cost-effective strategy compared with anastrozole as first-line treatment for 
HR-positive advanced breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy, and 
pemetrexed/cisplatin (PC) is the gold standard first-line regime. This study 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the addition of bevacizumab to PC (with 
maintenance bevacizumab) for unresectable MPM based on a phase III trial that 
showed a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone.
METHODS: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the 
incorporation of bevacizumab, a Markov model based on the MAPS trial, including 
the disease states of progression-free survival, progressive disease and death, 
was used. Total costs were calculated from a Chinese payer perspective, and 
health outcomes were converted into quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Model 
robustness was explored in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The addition of bevacizumab to PC was estimated to increase the cost by 
$81446.69, with a gain of 0.112 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $727202.589 per 
QALY. In both one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the 
ICER exceeded the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times the 
gross domestic product per capita of China ($23970.00 per QALY). The cost of 
bevacizumab had the most important impact on the ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bevacizumab with PC chemotherapy is not a 
cost-effective treatment option for MPM in China. Given its positive clinical 
value and extremely low incidence of MPM, an appropriate price discount, 
assistance programs and medical insurance should be considered to make 
bevacizumab more affordable for this rare patient population.

With demographic change and increasing life expectancy, osteoporotic fractures 
have become one of the most prevalent trauma conditions seen in daily clinical 
practice. A variety of factors are known to affect the rate of healing in 
osteoporotic conditions (e.g. both biochemical and biomechanical environment of 
callus cells). However, the influence of impairment of mesenchymal stem cell 
function in the osteoporotic condition on bone fracture healing has not been 
fully understood. In the present study, we develop a mathematical model that 
quantifies the change in biological processes within the fracture callus as a 
result of osteoporosis. The model includes special features of osteoporosis such 
as reduction in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) number in osteoporotic bone, 
impaired response of osteoporotic MSCs to their biomechanical microenvironment 
and the effects of configuration of locking compression plate (LCP) system on 
healing in this context. The results presented here suggest that 
mechanically-mediated MSCs differentiation at early stages of healing are 
significantly affected under osteoporotic conditions, while it is predicted that 
the flexible fixation achieved by increasing bone-plate distance of LCP could 
alleviate the negative effects of osteoporosis on healing. The outcomes of this 
study could potentially lead to patient specific surgical solutions, and thus 
achieve optimal healing outcomes in osteoporotic conditions.

The PROSPER model uses a three-tiered community partnership, university 
researcher, and Cooperative Extension-based technical assistance system to 
support the delivery of evidence-based interventions in communities. This study 
examines the trajectory and predictors of the collaborative relationship between 
technical assistance providers and community teams across the three phases of 
organization, implementation, and sustainability. Members of 14 PROmoting 
School-university-community Partnerships to Enhance Resilience (PROSPER) 
community teams and directors of local agencies rated communities' levels of 
readiness and adolescent substance use norms. Technical assistance providers 
rated their collaborative relationship with their teams at 14 occasions across 
4.5 years. Results from mixed models show that levels of collaboration were 
stable until the sustainability phase, when they increased significantly. Team 
differences in change were significant during the implementation phase. 
Community readiness predicted levels of the collaborative relationship over 
time: high community readiness was associated with a high level of collaboration 
during organization, but a decline in collaboration during implementation. These 
results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between 
technical assistance provision and community prevention teams and lead to 
recommendations to improve dissemination models to achieve a greater public 
health impact.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrhythmias are challenging diseases in childhood. Most of 
them in pediatric subjects (90.2%) are atrioventricular reentrant tachycardias 
and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardias. The standard 12-lead ECG is a 
highly accurate diagnostic tool but an invasive electrophysiological study is 
often required. The main concern about this kind of procedures is their invasive 
nature and the need of radiations, so antiarrhythmic agents are currently the 
first line therapy. However, they often show side effects and can be 
insufficient for the rate control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic research on Embase and PubMed. 
We found 563 articles and selected the most representative 50.
DISCUSSION: Management of cardiac arrhythmias could be very difficult in several 
scenarios, especially in children with body weight <15 kg and age <4 years. In 
general, pediatric subjects show a cumulative risk of malignancy greater than 
adults, having greater life expectancy. On this basis the guiding principle 
during radiation delivery in electrophysiological procedures is "as low as 
reasonably achievable" (acronym: ALARA). The development of 3-dimensional (3D) 
electroanatomical mapping systems allowed significant reduction of exposure. The 
most recently reported experiences demonstrate safety and feasibility of 
fluoroless ablation in the most common arrhythmias in children, even in 
challenging conditions.
CONCLUSION: The first reasonable approach in cardiac arrhythmias involving 
younger patients seems to be pharmacological. However antiarrhythmic drugs pose 
problems both in terms of side effects and often have poor efficacy. Expertise 
in electrophysiological techniques is constantly increasing and the development 
of new technologies allow us to encourage the use of electroanatomical mapping 
systems in order to reduce the radiation exposure in children undergoing to 
catheter ablation, especially for accessory pathways.

Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy has radically 
improved the life expectancy of patients with HIV, HIV positivity is still 
considered a major barrier to oncological treatment for patients with cancer 
because of their worse prognosis and increased susceptibility to toxic effects 
compared with patients who are immunocompetent. The use of radiotherapy with or 
without chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or molecular targeted therapy is the 
standard of care for several cancers. These new drugs and substantial 
improvements in radiotherapy techniques, including intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy, image-guided radiotherapy, and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, 
are optimising the feasibility of such anticancer treatments and are providing 
new opportunities for patients with cancer and HIV. In this Review, we discuss 
the role of radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy or new drugs, in the 
treatment of cancer in patients with HIV, with a focus on the efficacy and 
tolerability of this approach on the basis of available evidence. Moreover, we 
analyse and discuss the biological basis of interactions between HIV and 
radiotherapy, evidence from preclinical studies, and immunomodulation by 
radiotherapy in the HIV setting.

Bifid Spine is a multisystem malformation incurable and transmissible with a lot 
of important sequelae, some of them with treatment and some other avoidable. 
They affect and limit not only health but social-work life too. The main 
objective must be prevention. The primary prevention, meaning not occurrence, 
could be done by recognizing the possible etiologic factors that affect the 
population. This is a responsibility of health policies based in scientific 
evidences and expert's opinions. Secondary prevention would be to make efforts 
to decrease the consequences and improve newborns with bifid spine lif's quality 
and life expectancy. Actually, persons born with bifid spine, have a longterm 
life expectancy with specific necessities during their lives. The first two 
years of life are very important. During their adolescence and adult life, risk 
increases if any social-health aspect is abandoned giving up follow and 
self-care from the pediatrics coordinated assistance team, as it follows its 
natural evolution. It will cause totally avoidable complications. A patient with 
bifid spine is basically a person, not a group of diseases. It is essential to 
have a holistic and total look for each person with bifid spine and not consider 
the patient like a collection of troubles treated with different non coordinated 
specialities. The individual intervention of each medical doctor could damage 
and it could be better if they work coordinated for a long time. This strategy 
would allow improved efficiency (cost/efficacy) and quality of assistance. Every 
effort done and the objectives reached in childhood can be improved with the 
multidisciplinary coordinated assistance, but it can be lost if it does not 
continue during all life. It may cause a serious and evitable damage in life 
quality with loss of spent health resources.
