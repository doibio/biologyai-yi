BACKGROUND: In the presence of multimorbidity and limited life expectancy (LLE), 
the need for continued use of preventive medicines becomes uncertain as they may 
neither improve health nor confer continued health benefits.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to systematically review the literature to examine 
the discontinuation of preventive medicines in older people with LLE.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the Ovid MEDLINE, 
Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the 
Cochrane Central Register databases. Studies investigating discontinuation of 
preventive medicines in older individuals (mean age ≥65 years) with LLE 
(≤12 months) published between 1 January 1997 and 28 February 2017 were 
included. The Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment criteria and the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale were used to assess the quality of the studies.
RESULTS: Ten studies-a randomized controlled trial (RCT), two case-control 
studies, and seven cohort studies-involving 26,854 participants with a mean age 
ranging from 66.0 to 85.0 years were included in this review. The studies were 
primarily conducted in palliative care (n = 3), residential facility (n = 2), 
and community (n = 1) settings, and the remainder were pharmacoepidemiological 
studies (n = 4). The most common life-limiting illnesses were cancer (n = 5), 
followed by other unspecified illnesses (n = 4) and advanced dementia (n = 1). 
The most common preventive medicine discontinued was statins, followed by 
warfarin and aspirin. LLE potentially prompted discontinuation; however, some 
individuals continued to receive preventive medicines until they died.
CONCLUSIONS: The review found that withdrawal of preventive medicines at the end 
of life is challenging. Decisions about the discontinuation of preventive 
medicines for individuals approaching the end of life are increasingly 
complicated by the lack of clear deprescribing guidelines for these medicines.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease with a 
prevalence of approximately 1 in 1000. Over the last 30 years, advances in 
treatment such as use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have improved 
life expectancy and quality of life for patients with lupus and the key unmet 
needs have therefore changed. With the reduced mortality from disease activity, 
development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become an increasingly important 
cause of death in patients with SLE. The increased CVD risk in these patients is 
partly, but not fully explained by standard risk factors, and abnormalities in 
the immune response to lipids may play a role. Invariant natural killer T cells, 
which are triggered specifically by lipid antigens, may protect against 
progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. However, currently our 
recommendation is that clinicians should focus on optimal management of standard 
CVD risk factors such as smoking, blood pressure and lipid levels. Fatigue is 
one of the most common and most limiting symptoms suffered by patients with SLE. 
The cause of fatigue is multifactorial and disease activity does not explain 
this symptom. Consequently, therapies directed towards reducing inflammation and 
disease activity do not reliably reduce fatigue and new approaches are needed. 
Currently, we recommend asking about sleep pattern, optimising pain relief and 
excluding other causes of fatigue such as anaemia and metabolic disturbances. 
For the subgroup of patients whose disease activity is not fully controlled by 
standard treatment regimes, a range of different biologic agents have been 
proposed and subjected to clinical trials. Many of these trials have given 
disappointing results, though belimumab, which targets B lymphocytes, did meet 
its primary endpoint. New biologics targeting B cells, T cells or cytokines 
(especially interferon) are still going through trials raising the hope that 
novel therapies for patients with refractory SLE may be available soon.

[NOTES FROM A SIX MONTHS VOLUNTEER MISSION AS MEDICAL STAFF IN A DISTRICT 
HOSPITAL IN UGANDA].

In December 2014 my husband and I flew for a stay of six months in Uganda. We 
went there in order to volunteer in the district hospital of Kiboga, one of the 
most impoverished districts of this poverty stricken country. A district in 
which over 60% of the population lives off less than a dollar and twenty five 
cents a day, in which the average life expectancy is 46.7 years (9.1 years lower 
than the national average expectancy). Kiboga's district hospital serves the 
300,000 residents of the district, of whom 20,000 live in the district capital, 
while the rest are mainly farmers and cattle keepers, scattered in small 
villages that have limited and weather-dependent access. The hospital houses 120 
beds, which are divided into four wards (maternity, pediatric, male and female), 
and is manned routinely by one on-call local physician, who (when present) is 
almost exclusively occupied by emergency cesarean sections. Therefore, the 
majority of hospitalized patients are not inspected by a doctor at any point of 
their stay. The hospital functions with no running water and in the absence of a 
reliable power supply. The nursing staff, composed largely of people with 
limited or no training, is always desperately understaffed, and many of the 
means needed for a patient's stay (starting with a bed pan and linens and ending 
with many of the medications prescribed) are not supplied by the hospital. 
Perhaps it would have been appropriate to continue by describing unsettling data 
about the health infrastructure in Kiboga (such as the fact that infant 
mortality rate is a staggering 15%, or that nearly 10% of the districts 
population have HIV), however, it appears to me that it would be more educating 
to learn from the story of the patients we encountered.

Modeling Short-Term, Trial-Based, Mortality Risk Reduction and Post-Trial Life 
Expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The benefits and costs of a treatment are typically heterogeneous 
across individual patients. Randomized clinical trials permit the examination of 
individualized treatment benefits over the trial horizon but extrapolation to 
lifetime horizon usually involves combining trial-based individualized estimates 
of short-term risk reduction with less detailed (less granular) population life 
tables. However, the underlying assumption of equal post-trial life expectancy 
for low- and high-risk patients of the same sex and age is unrealistic. We aimed 
to study the influence of unequal granularity between models of short-term risk 
reduction and life expectancy on individualized estimates of cost-effectiveness 
of aggressive thrombolysis for patients with an acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: To estimate life years gained, we multiplied individualized estimates 
of short-term risk reduction either with less granular and with equally granular 
post-trial life expectancy estimates. Estimates of short-term risk reduction 
were obtained from GUSTO trial data (30,510 patients) using logistic regression 
analysis with treatment, sex, and age as predictor variables. Life expectancy 
estimates were derived from sex- and age-specific US life tables.
RESULTS: Based on sex- and age-specific, short-term risk reductions but average 
population life expectancy (less granularity), we found that aggressive 
thrombolysis was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below 
$50,000) for women above age 49 y and men above age 53 y (92% and 69% of the 
population, respectively). Considering sex- and age-specific short-term 
mortality risk reduction and correspondingly sex- and age-specific life 
expectancy (equal granularity), aggressive thrombolysis was cost-effective for 
men above age 45 y and women above age 50 y (95% and 76% of the population, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Failure to model short-term risk reduction and life expectancy at 
an equal level of granularity may bias our estimates of individualized 
cost-effectiveness and misallocate resources.

This study was conducted to better understand the life history of 
Parthenolecanium corni (Bouché) and Parthenolecanium quercifex (Fitch) 
(Hemiptera: Coccidae), and to develop degree-day models for crawler emergence of 
the two soft scale species in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Virginia. Both species were univoltine in the southeastern United States. In 
South Carolina, eggs hatched from mid-April to early June; second instars began 
to appear in September and migrated to twigs to overwinter in October; and third 
instars and adults appeared in mid-March to early April. Each parthenogenetic 
female produced on average 1,026 ± 52 eggs. Fecundity was positively correlated 
to the fresh weight, length, width, and height of gravid females. Gross 
reproductive rate (GRR) was 695.98 ± 79.34 ♀/♀, net reproductive rate (Rº) was 
126.36 ± 19.03 ♀/♀, mean generation time (TG) was 52.61 ± 0.05 wk, intrinsic 
rate of increase (rm) was 0.04 ♀/♀/wk, and finite rate of increase (λ) was 1.04 
times per week. Crawlers first occurred across Georgia, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, and Virginia in 2011-2013 when 524-596 Celsius-degree-days (DDC) had 
been accumulated with the single sine estimation method, or 411-479 DDC with the 
simple average method, at the base temperature of 12.8 °C and the start date of 
1 January. These regional models accurately predicted the date of crawler 
emergence within 1 wk of the actual emergence in 2014.

Attempt to Develop Cost-Effective Rearing of Amblyseius swirskii (Acari: 
Phytoseiidae): Assessment of Different Artificial Diets.

Commercial production of Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot based on storage 
mites needs both space and labor to maintain large cultures of these prey, and 
also may lead to health problems for workers. Therefore, the accessibility of a 
suitable artificial diet could eliminate the mentioned problems; however, the 
artificial diets must support the persistent production of high quality progeny. 
This study endeavored to find a more easily available and cheaper nutrient that 
may further reduce the cost of diet production for A. swirskii. The predator's 
performance was determined when it was fed on a basic artificial diet (AD1) 
composed of honey, sucrose, tryptone, yeast extract, and hen egg yolk, and on 
eight other artificial diets consisting of 80% AD1 enriched with different 
nutrients including maize pollen (AD2), hemolymph of Plusia gamma L. (AD3), 
Ephestia eggs (AD4), Artemis cysts (AD5), Ephestia last-instar larvae (AD6), 
multivitamin syrup (AD7), bovine serum albumin (AD8), and bull sperm (AD9). The 
lowest development time was on AD2. The highest value of fecundity and 
oviposition period were observed on AD5, followed by AD2 and AD4. The intrinsic 
rate of increase (r) and the finite rate of increase (λ) reached the maximal 
value on AD5. Feeding on AD2 and AD5 resulted in highest value of R0 (net 
reproductive rate). Our results indicated that Artemia cysts and maize pollen 
had better potential to be used as nutrient in artificial diet for mass 
production of A. swirskii. Overall, it seems that AD2 is the most cost effective 
than others.

Population growth parameters of the Dysaphis pyri (Boyer de Fonscolombe) 
(Hemiptera: Aphididae) were evaluated on four different cultivars (Coscia, 
Ankara, Williams, and Santa-Maria) of pear (Pyrus communis L.) under field 
conditions in the Van region of Turkey. Aphids were kept on leaves of 10-yr-old 
pear trees in Plexiglas clip-cells (20 mm in diameter and 10 mm in height, with 
the upper side covered with muslin). For the description of the stage 
differentiation during population growth, we analyzed raw data of developmental 
time, survival, and fecundity using the age-stage, two-sex life table to take 
the variable developmental rate among individuals into account. Results 
indicated that the Coscia and Ankara cultivars are less favorable hosts for D. 
pyri because of the longer preadult developmental time, higher preadult 
mortality rate, and lower total fecundity on these cultivars. The intrinsic rate 
of increase (r), the net reproduction rate (R0), and the finite rate of increase 
(λ) values were lower on the Coscia and Ankara cultivars. We discussed the 
application of the Weibull function, polynomial model, and Enkegaard model in 
life table studies. Because these models are often inaccurate in describing 
survival and reproduction parameters, we suggest that their application in life 
table research should be reevaluated.

Temperature has significant effects on the development, survival, and 
reproduction of ectothermic organisms. In this study, we examined the effect of 
temperature on the demographic characteristics of two predatory mite species, 
Neosciulus womersleyi (Schicha) and N. longispinosus (Evans), reared on 
Tetranychus urticae Koch. The developmental and reproductive traits of both 
species were examined at 10 constant temperatures between 15 °C and 37.5 °C. The 
preadult development time of N. womersleyi and N. longispinosus decreased with 
increasing temperature until 32.5 °C and 35 °C, respectively. The lower 
developmental threshold (T0) and thermal constant (K) estimated by using a 
linear model were 11.61 °C and 69.36 DD for N. womersleyi and 11.92 °C and 61.5 
DD for N. longispinosus, respectively. Total preoviposition period and total 
longevity of females and males of N. womersleyi and N. longispinosus decreased 
with increasing temperature. The mean generation time (T) first decreased with 
temperature until 32.5 and 35 °C for N. womersleyi and N. longispinosus, 
respectively, and then increased at higher temperatures. The R0 and r values 
first increased with temperature until 32.5 and 30 °C for N. womersleyi and N. 
longispinosus, respectively, and then decreased at higher temperatures. The R0 
and r values for N. longispinosus at 37.5 °C were 0.3 offspring and -0.143 d-1, 
respectively. These results show that N. longispinosus is less fit than N. 
womersleyi at 37.5 °C.

The khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium Everts (Coleoptera: Dermestidae), is a 
polyphagous pest that infests many stored grains and products. The effect of 
nine maize hybrids including 704, AR 89, AS 71, AS 77, BC 678, KSC 703, PL 472, 
SC 704, and Simax was studied on biology and life table parameters of T. 
granarium at controlled conditions (33 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 5% RH, and a photoperiod of 
14:10 [L:D] h). According to the results of this study, the immature period was 
the longest on BC 678 (56.79 ± SE: 1.51 d) and the shortest on PL 472 
(39.90 ± 0.48 d). The highest values of fecundity and fertility were observed on 
PL 472 (67.95 ± 1.23 eggs and 74.81 ± 0.68%, respectively) and the lowest values 
were on BC 678 (40.00 ± 1.63 and 48.24 ± 1.35, respectively). The net 
reproductive rate (R0) of T. granarium ranged from 10.40 ± 0.11 offsprings on BC 
678 to 30.43 ± 0.20 offsprings on KSC 703. The highest intrinsic rate of 
increase (rm) was for T. granarium reared on KSC 703 (0.0773 ± 0.0001 d-1), and 
the lowest was on BC 678 (0.0390 ± 0.0002 d-1). According to the obtained 
results, BC 678 is an unfavorable hybrid for population increase of T. 
granarium, which can be recommended to be grown in regions where the damage of 
T. granarium is considerable to minimize maize infestations by this pest.

BACKGROUND: During the previous century the average lifespan in the United 
States (US) increased by over 30 years, with much of this increase attributed to 
public health initiatives. This report examines further gains that might be 
achieved through reduced occurrence of injury-related death.
METHODS: US life tables and injury death rate data were used to estimate 
potential increases in life expectancy assuming various reductions in the rate 
of fatal injuries. Corresponding numbers of deaths potentially averted annually 
were also estimated; unit (per death) medical and lifetime work loss costs were 
employed to estimate total costs potentially averted annually.
RESULTS: Through elimination of injury as a cause of death, average US life 
expectancy at birth could be increased by approximately 1.5 years, with notable 
variations by sex, ethnicity, and race. More conservatively, average life 
expectancy at birth could be increased by 0.41 years assuming that the national 
injury death rate could be brought into line with the lowest state-specific 
rate. Under this more conservative but plausible assumption, an estimated 48,400 
injury deaths and $61 billion in medical and work loss costs would be averted 
annually.
CONCLUSIONS: Increases in life expectancy of the magnitude considered in this 
report are arguably attainable based on long-term historical reductions in the 
US injury death rate, as well as significant continuing reductions seen in other 
developed countries. Contemporary evidence-based interventions can play an 
important role in reducing injury-related deaths, such as those due to drug 
overdoses and older adult falls, as well as suicides.

Ageing is assumed to be accompanied by greater health care expenditures but the 
association is also viewed as a 'red herring'. This study aimed to evaluate 
whether age is associated with health care costs in the senior elderly, using 
electronic health records for 98,220 participants aged 80 years and over 
registered with the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital 
Episode Statistics (2010-2014). Annual costs of health care utilization were 
estimated from a two-part model; multiple fractional polynomial models were 
employed to evaluate the non-linear association of age with predicted 
health care costs while also controlling for comorbidities, impairments, and 
death proximity. Annual health care costs increased from 80 years (£2972 in men, 
£2603 in women) to 97 (men; £4721) or 98 years (women; £3963), before declining. 
Costs were significantly elevated in the last year of life but this effect 
declined with age, from £10,027 in younger octogenarians to £7021 in 
centenarians. This decline was steeper in participants with comorbidities or 
impairments; £14,500 for 80-84-year-olds and £6752 for centenarians with 7+ 
impairments. At other times, comorbidity and impairments, not age, were main 
drivers of costs. We conclude that comorbidities, impairments, and proximity to 
death are key mediators of age-related increases in health care costs. While the 
costs of comorbidity among survivors are not generally associated with age, 
additional costs in the last year of life decline with age.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental illness (SMI) have a lower life expectancy 
due in part to a higher prevalence of cardiac and metabolic disease. Less is 
known of the prevalence of respiratory disease in this group.
AIMS: This cross-sectional, observational study aimed to assess the prevalence 
of symptoms associated with respiratory disease in patients admitted to an 
inpatient mental health unit.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 82 inpatients had a structured interview and 
questionnaire completed. The questionnaire included self-reported diagnoses of 
common diseases and screening questions designed to detect respiratory disease 
and sleep disordered breathing. Targeted spirometry was performed on the basis 
of symptoms and smoking status.
RESULTS: Patients reported high rates of respiratory symptoms, including 
wheezing (38%) and dyspnoea (44%); 52% of patients reported daily tobacco use. 
Productive cough was significantly associated with tobacco use (P < 0.005). Ten 
patients (18%) had spirometry consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) of whom six did not have a formal diagnosis of COPD previously.
CONCLUSIONS: People with SMI have high rates of respiratory symptoms with a high 
prevalence of COPD on spirometry. Half of the COPD cases were not previously 
diagnosed, suggesting a hidden burden of respiratory disease in patients with 
SMI.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of ultrasound-guided high-intensity 
focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) and open hysterectomy for adenomyosis.
DESIGN: A retrospective analysis.
SETTING: Gynaecological department in a single centre in China.
POPULATION: Patients with symptomatic adenomyosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost difference between patients with adenomyosis treated 
with USgHIFU and open hysterectomy.
METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-eight patients with adenomyosis were 
retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 302 patients were treated with USgHIFU and 
66 patients with open hysterectomy. All of them had 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month 
follow ups. The patients' quality of life (QOL) was evaluated and the utility 
scores were obtained from a rating scale to conduct a cost-utility analysis 
(CUA).
RESULTS: No significant differences were found at any follow-up time point in 
the QOL between the two groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the QOL scores 
significantly increased in both groups (P < 0.05): the quality adjusted life 
year (QALY) for patients treated with USgHIFU was USUS$5256.48, whereas it was 
USUS$7510.03 for patients treated with open hysterectomy. Both incremental cost 
and sensitivity analysis showed that USgHIFU was less costly than open 
hysterectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The QOL of patients with adenomyosis can be significantly improved 
by either USgHIFU or open hysterectomy, but USgHIFU is less costly.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: USgHIFU can safely be used to treat patients with 
adenomyosis and significantly improved the quality of life of patients after 
treatment. The cost of USgHIFU is less than that of surgical treatment.

OBJECTIVES: The methodological quality of an economic evaluation performed 
alongside a clinical trial can be underestimated if the paper does not report 
key methodological features. This study discusses methodological assessment 
issues on the example of a systematic review on cost-effectiveness of 
physiotherapy for knee osteoarthritis.
METHODS: Six economic evaluation studies included in the systematic review and 
related clinical trials were assessed using the 10-question check-list by 
Drummond and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale.
RESULTS: All economic evaluations were performed alongside a clinical trial but 
the studied interventions were too heterogeneous to be synthesized. 
Methodological quality of the economic evaluations reported in the papers was 
not free of drawbacks, and in some cases, it improved when information from the 
related clinical trial was taken into account.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluation papers dedicate little space to methodological 
features of related clinical trials; therefore, the methodological quality can 
be underestimated if evaluated separately from the trials. Future economic 
evaluations should follow more strictly the recommendations about methodology 
and the authors should pay special attention to the quality of reporting.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a common, debilitating and costly disorder. The 
best-evidenced psychological therapy - cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) - is 
complex and costly. A simpler therapy, behavioural activation (BA), may be an 
effective alternative.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA 
compared with CBT for depressed adults at 12 and 18 months' follow-up, and to 
investigate the processes of treatments.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial stratified by depression 
severity, antidepressant use and recruitment site, with embedded process 
evaluation; and randomisation by remote computer-generated allocation.
SETTING: Three community mental health services in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥ 18 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) 
recruited from primary care and psychological therapy services.
INTERVENTIONS: BA delivered by NHS junior mental health workers (MHWs); CBT by 
NHS psychological therapists.
OUTCOMES: Primary: depression severity (as measured via the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) at 12 months. Secondary: MDD status; number of 
depression-free days; anxiety (as measured via the Generalised Anxiety 
Disorder-7); health-related quality of life (as measured via the Short Form 
questionnaire-36 items) at 6, 12 and 18 months; and PHQ-9 at 6 and 18 months, 
all collected by assessors blinded to treatment allocation. Non-inferiority 
margin was 1.9 PHQ-9 points. We undertook intention-to-treat (ITT) and per 
protocol (PP) analyses. We explored cost-effectiveness by collecting direct 
treatment and other health- and social-care costs and calculating 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level 
version, at 18 months.
RESULTS: We recruited 440 participants (BA, n = 221; CBT, n = 219); 175 (79%) BA 
and 189 (86%) CBT participants provided ITT data and 135 (61%) BA and 151 (69%) 
CBT participants provided PP data. At 12 months we found that BA was 
non-inferior to CBT {ITT: CBT 8.4 PHQ-9 points [standard deviation (SD) 7.5 
PHQ-9 points], BA 8.4 PHQ-9 points (SD 7.0 PHQ-9 points), mean difference 0.1 
PHQ-9 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3 to 1.5 PHQ-9 points, p = 0.89; 
PP: CBT 7.9 PHQ-9 points (SD 7.3 PHQ-9 points), BA 7.8 PHQ-9 points (SD 6.5 
PHQ-9 points), mean difference 0.0 PHQ-9 points, 95% CI -1.5 to 1.6 PHQ-9 
points, p = 0.99}. We found no differences in secondary outcomes. We found a 
significant difference in mean intervention costs (BA, £975; CBT, £1235; 
p < 0.001), but no differences in non-intervention (hospital, community health, 
social care and medication costs) or total (non-intervention plus intervention) 
costs. Costs were lower and QALY outcomes better in the BA group, generating an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -£6865. The probability of BA being 
cost-effective compared with CBT was almost 80% at the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence's preferred willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20,000-30,000 per QALY. There were no trial-related adverse events.
LIMITATIONS: In this pragmatic trial many depressed participants in both groups 
were also taking antidepressant medication, although most had been doing so for 
a considerable time before entering the trial. Around one-third of participants 
chose not to complete a PP dose of treatment, a finding common in both 
psychotherapy trials and routine practice.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that BA is as effective as CBT, more cost-effective and 
can be delivered by MHWs with no professional training in psychological 
therapies.
FUTURE WORK: Settings and countries with a paucity of professionally qualified 
psychological therapists, might choose to investigate the delivery of effective 
psychological therapy for depression without the need to develop an extensive 
and costly professional infrastructure.

OBJECTIVES: To enhance understanding of the relationship between multimorbidity, 
symptom burden, and functional status in individuals with life-limiting illness.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized clinical trial 
conducted in the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group. Group differences 
were tested using a t-test; multivariate regression analysis was used to 
determine the effect of multiple variables on functional status and symptom 
burden.
SETTING: Fifteen Palliative Care Research Cooperation sites.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults who participated in a parent statin-discontinuation 
clinical trial were included in the analysis (N = 381). Inclusion criteria were 
diagnosis of a life-limiting illness, statin use for 3 months or longer, life 
expectancy longer than 1 month, and declining functional status.
MEASUREMENTS: Cancer diagnosis (solid organ and hematologic malignancies), 
multimorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score), symptom burden 
(Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) score, number of symptoms with ESAS 
severity score >4), functional status (Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance 
Scale (AKPS)).
RESULTS: Fifty-one percent had a primary diagnosis of cancer; mean age 74.1 ± 
11.6. Participants had multiple comorbid illnesses (CCI score 4.9 ± 2.8), 
multiple symptoms (ESAS score 27.2 ± 15.9), and poor functional status (AKPS = 
53 ± 13). In univariate and multivariate analyses, multimorbidity was associated 
with greater symptom burden (4.2 vs 3.1 moderate or severe symptoms (t = -3.2, P 
= .002), 12% vs 6% with severe symptoms (t = -3.7, P < .001)), but cancer 
diagnosis was not. In univariate and multivariate analyses, higher symptom 
burden was associated with poorer functional status (F = 11.6, P < .001), but 
multimorbidity was not.
CONCLUSION: Symptoms cannot be attributed solely to a diagnosis of cancer. The 
association between symptom burden and functional status underscores the 
importance of clinical attention to symptoms in individuals with multimorbidity.

The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of 27 institutes and centers at the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH), was founded in 1974 to conduct and support 
research on aging and the health and well-being of older people. The Institute's 
interests span the fundamental processes that contribute to aging and their 
impact on systems; diseases and conditions for which aging is a risk factor; and 
interventions that may prevent, delay, or treat these conditions or otherwise 
contribute to an extension of healthy, active years of life. Multiple fruitful 
research collaborations within and outside the federal government, spanning the 
breadth of the Institute's research activities, have marked NIA's growth over 
the past 40 years, as well as its current areas of ongoing research. This 
article discusses several highlights of these collaborations, including the 
Health and Retirement Study, geroscience research, falls injury prevention in 
elderly adults, and implementation of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's 
Disease, from the perspective of past accomplishments and trends for the future.

AIM: Early intervention services (EIS) for psychosis are being implemented, 
internationally. It is important to learn from established examples and define 
the components and intensity of services that provide good value for money. This 
study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of EIS according to how closely they 
adhered to the recommendations of the English Department of Health 2001 Policy 
Implementation Guide (PIG).
METHODS: EIS from the National Eden Study were assessed using a measure of 
fidelity to the PIG that rated the presence or absence of 64 recommended items 
relating to team structure and practice. EIS were then classified into three 
groups: those with fidelity of 75-80%, 81-90% and 91-95%. Patient-level resource 
use and outcomes were measured 1 year following inception into the service; 
costs were calculated and combined with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained.
RESULTS: At a threshold of £20 000 per QALY, the 81-90% fidelity group had a 
56.3% likelihood of being the most cost-effective option followed by 75-80% 
fidelity at 35.8% and 91-95% fidelity group (7.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results from England suggest that striving to maximize fidelity 
may not be warranted, but that dropping below a certain level of fidelity may 
result in inefficient use of resources.

Nowadays, there is an aggressive rate in consumption of noodles and pasta 
products throughout the world. Consumer acceptability and preference of these 
functional products can be promoted by the discovery of novel knowledge to 
improve their formulation and quality. The development of fortified-formulations 
for noodles and pasta products based on microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) can 
guarantee the shelf life extension with minimum quality losses. The current 
review focuses on recent trends and future prospects of MTGase utilization in 
the structural matrix of noodles and pasta products and represents the quality 
changes of cooking loss, texture, microstructure, color and sensory attributes 
of the MTGase-incorporated products. Digestibility, nutritional and health 
aspects of the MTGase-enriched formulations are also reviewed with a vision 
toward physical functions and safety outcomes of MTGases isolated from new 
microbial sources. The high potential of MTGase in developing commercial noodles 
and pasta products is successfully demonstrated. MTGase by modifying the 
crystallinity or molecular structure via covalent crosslinks between protein 
molecules strengthens the doughs stability and the textural characteristics of 
final products with the low- or high-protein flour. Compared with the control 
samples, the MTGase-supplemented products indicate slower digestion rates and 
better sensory and cooking properties without any remarkable color instability.

The cuticle is a unique invisible oviduct secretion that protects avian eggs 
from bacterial penetration through gas exchange pores. Despite its importance, 
experimental evidence is lacking for where, when, and what is responsible for 
its deposition. By using knowledge about the ovulatory cycle and oviposition, we 
have manipulated cuticle deposition to obtain evidence on these key points. 
Cuticle deposition was measured using staining and spectrophotometry. 
Experimental evidence supports the location of cuticle deposition to be the 
shell gland pouch (uterus), not the vagina, and the time of deposition to be 
within the final hour before oviposition. Oviposition induced by arginine 
vasotocin or prostaglandin, the penultimate and ultimate factors for the 
induction of oviposition, produces an egg with no cuticle; therefore, these 
factors are not responsible for cuticle secretion. Conversely, oviposition 
induced by GNRH, which mimics the normal events of ovulation and oviposition, 
results in a normal cuticle. There is no evidence that cuticle deposition 
differs at the end of a clutch and, therefore, there is no evidence that the 
ovulatory surge of progesterone affects cuticle deposition. Overall, the results 
demonstrate that the cuticle is a specific secretion and is not merely an 
extension of the organic matrix of the shell. Cuticle deposition was found to be 
reduced by an environmental stressor, and there is no codependence of the 
deposition of pigment and cuticle. Defining the basic facts surrounding cuticle 
deposition will help reduce contamination of hen's eggs and increase 
understanding of the strategies birds use to protect their eggs.

MAP kinases (MAPK) are the most downstream kinases in signal transduction 
cascades and regulate critical cellular activities such as cell proliferation, 
differentiation, mortality, stress response, and apoptosis. The Leishmania 
donovani MAPK1 (LdMAPK1) is involved in parasite viability and drug resistance, 
but its substrates have not been identified yet. Aiming to identify the possible 
targets(s) of LdMAPK1, we sought to isolate interacting partners by 
co-immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Out of 
fifteen analyzed protein bands, four were identified as subunits of the HSP90 
foldosome complex, namely HSP 90, HSP70, STI and SGT. Western blot analysis not 
only confirmed that LdMAPK1 interacts with HSP70 and HSP90 but also demonstrated 
that MAPK1 abundance modulates their expression. The interaction is sensitive to 
treatment with AMTZD, a competitive ERK inhibitor. MAPK1 also displayed kinase
