treatment.
METHODS: We carried out cost-effectiveness analysis using the institutional 
perspective, including a 45-year time frame and a 3% discount rate for costs and 
effectiveness. We employed a Bayesian-focused decision tree and a Markov model. 
One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed, as well as 
threshold-oriented and probabilistic analyses, and we obtained acceptability 
curves and net health benefits.
RESULTS: Triple therapy (peginterferon plus ribavirin plus thymosin alpha-1) was 
dominant with lower cost and higher utility in relationship with peginterferon + 
ribavirin option, peginterferon alone and no-treatment option. In triple therapy 
the cost per unit of success was of 1,908 [USD/quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY)] compared with peginterferon plus ribavirin 2,277/QALY, peginterferon 
alone 2,929/QALY, and no treatment 4,204/QALY. Sensitivity analyses confirmed 
the robustness of the base case.
CONCLUSIONS: Peginterferon plus ribavirin plus thymosin alpha-1 option was 
dominant (lowest cost and highest effectiveness). Using no drug was the most 
expensive and least effective option.

vaccination against human papillomavirus infection and disease.

Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause of cervical 
cancer, other anogenital cancers, genital warts, and recurrent respiratory 
papillomatosis. Clinical studies have demonstrated that a prophylactic HPV 
vaccine can prevent infection, genital warts, and the precancerous lesions that 
lead to cervical cancer. Given the absence of data on the long-term 
effectiveness of HPV vaccination, a number of mathematical models have been 
developed to provide insight to policy makers by projecting the long-term 
epidemiologic and economic consequences of vaccination and evaluate alternative 
vaccination policies. This paper reviews the state of these models. Three types 
of HPV mathematical models have been reported in the literature: cohort, 
population dynamic, and hybrid. All have demonstrated that vaccination can 
significantly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in the long term. However, 
only the cohort and hybrid models have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
vaccination strategies for preventing cervical cancer. These models have 
generally shown that vaccinating females can be cost-effective. None has 
accounted for the potential benefits of vaccinating the population to reduce the 
burden of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and cancers of the vagina, vulva, 
anus, penis, and head/neck. Given that only the population dynamic model can 
account for both the direct and indirect (i.e., herd immunity effects) benefits 
of vaccination in the population, future research should focus on further 
development of dynamic models by expanding the range of epidemiologic outcomes 
tracked and including the ability to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
alternative vaccination policies.

Calorie restriction (CR) increases life span in yeast independently of Sir2. 
Lamming et al. (Reports, 16 September 2005, p. 1861) recently proposed that 
Sir2-independent life-span extension by CR is mediated by the Sir2 paralogs Hst1 
and Hst2. Contradictory to this, we find that CR greatly increases life span in 
cells lacking Sir2, Hst1, and Hst2, which suggests that CR is not mediated by 
Sir2, Hst2, or Hst1.

Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. tanne@post.tau.ac.il

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: C-reactive protein (CRP) has emerged as an important 
predictor of cardiovascular disease, but there are few prospective data on its 
association with risk of ischemic stroke in patients at high risk.
METHODS: We examined the association between CRP levels and subsequent risk of 
incident ischemic stroke among 2979 patients with stable coronary heart disease 
included in a controlled clinical trial (Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention) that 
assessed the efficacy of bezafibrate, a fibric acid derivative, versus placebo 
for secondary prevention. CRP was measured by a high-sensitivity assay in plasma 
samples collected before randomization and again at the second follow-up year of 
an overall mean follow-up of 6.2 years.
RESULTS: Risk of ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years increased from 4.1% for 
baseline CRP in the lowest tertile (<2.3 mg/L; n=982) to 5.9% for levels at the 
middle tertile (2.3 to 5.4 mg/L; n=1013) and 10.5% for CRP levels at the upper 
tertile (>5.4 mg/L; n=984; P<0.001). With adjustment for potential confounders, 
baseline CRP levels in the top versus bottom tertile were associated with a 
2.16-fold increased hazard (95% CI, 1.32 to 3.53) for ischemic stroke, and CRP 
levels measured after 2 years were associated with a hazard ratio of 2.43 (95% 
CI, 1.30 to 4.57). The risk of an incident ischemic stroke did not differ 
between the bezafibrate group compared with the placebo group regardless of 
baseline CRP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings, based on a large prospective study, demonstrate the 
risk prediction for incident ischemic stroke conferred by CRP levels in patients 
at high risk.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical outcomes of palliative spinal reconstruction 
using cervical pedicle screws in metastatic spine tumors.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No study to date has investigated the effectiveness 
of cervical pedicle screw fixation in metastatic lesions of the spine.
METHODS: A total of 32 patients with metastatic spine tumors who underwent 
reconstructive surgery using cervical pedicle screws were reviewed. Four 
patients presented upper cervical lesions and 28 patients had subaxial lesions. 
All patients had intractable pain, 29 presented myelopathy, and 18 patients were 
nonambulatory. Combined anterior column reconstruction was considered in cases 
of life expectancy more than 2 years and anterior spinal cord compression that 
could not be solved by posterior decompression and kyphosis correction. 
Posterior fixation alone was performed in 25 patients, and posterior fixation 
combined with anterior column reconstruction was performed in 7 patients.
RESULTS: The average postoperative survival period was 12.2 months. Neck pain 
was improved in all cases. Twenty-four (83%) of the 29 patients with spinal cord 
lesions presented neurologic improvement. Of 18 patients who were not 
ambulatory, 16 patients (89%) became ambulatory. Pain relief, neurologic 
function, and spinal stability were maintained throughout the survival period in 
30 of 32 patients (94%).
CONCLUSION: Spinal reconstruction using cervical pedicle screws improved spinal 
stability, pain, and neurologic function. These improvements were maintained 
throughout the survival period in 94% of the patients. Anterior column 
reconstruction could be avoided in 78% of the patients in spite of damaged 
anterior column.

Since the last decade, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty with Inoue 
catheter is considered the treatment of choice for selected patients (mobile 
valve, no calcification and minimal subvalvular disease) with rheumatic mitral 
stenosis.
OBJECTIVE: We present the seven-year follow-up experience of 456 patients 
treated with this technique in the catheter laboratory of the Cardiology 
Hospital in National Medical Center SXXI.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: It is a retrospective, transversal and observational study 
performed with data obtained from January 1994 and December 2000, with a 
follow-up of 58.5 +/- 26.6 months (range 12-96 mean 22).
RESULTS: We achieve an initial success of 82.8%, improvement of initial mitral 
valve area from 0.9 +/- 0.1 to 1.8 +/- 0.3 cm2, with a gain area from 88 to 106% 
(p < or = 0.001). At the end of the follow-up, the mean valvular area was 
maintained in 1.7 +/- 0.3 cm2 in 69.8% of the cases. We found a significant 
reduction of transmitral gradient and of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
immediately after the procedure; 93.1% of patients were in NYHA functional class 
II at the end of the follow-up, 11.6% presented complications (mitral 
regurgitation as the most important), in 15.9% of them, due to leaflet rupture, 
but only 9.1% corresponded to severe grade Ill-IV.
COMPLICATIONS: Only one patient died due to septal perforation; 93.8% of the 
patients remained free of major cardiac events at the end of the study. Only 
6.1% of the patients required surgery at the end of the follow-up; 5.5% were in 
functional class NYHA Ill-IV and restenosis occurred in 14.6%.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty with Inoue balloon 
catheter is a safe and effective technique for treating rheumatic mitral 
stenosis with Wilkins score < 10, with minimal risk and complications and offers 
good life expectancy with absence of major cardiac events in > 90%. From these 
patients, 93.1% remained in NYHA-II or -I functional class and the incidence of 
restenosis decreased.

Health benefits of antiviral therapy for mild chronic hepatitis C: randomised 
controlled trial and economic evaluation.

Investigators.

(1)Department of Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether combined therapy with interferon-alpha and 
ribavirin was more effective and cost-effective than no treatment for patients 
with mild chronic hepatitis C.
DESIGN: A multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-blinded trial assessed the 
efficacy of combination therapy. A Markov model used these efficacy data 
combined with data on transition probabilities, costs and health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) to assess the lifetime cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
SETTING: A multicentre NHS setting.
PARTICIPANTS: Treatment-naive, adult patients with histologically mild chronic 
hepatitis C (Ishak necroinflammatory scores <4 and fibrosis scores <3 on liver 
biopsy).
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to receive interferon-alpha and 
ribavirin for 48 weeks or no treatment (control).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of 
patients having a sustained virological response (SVR), measured at 6 months 
after cessation of therapy. Secondary outcome measures were: the ability of 
early phase kinetics to predict the eventual outcome of treating mild disease; 
HRQoL measured using the Short Form 36 and EuroQol (5 Dimensions) 
questionnaires, and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 
interferon-alpha and ribavirin for mild disease compared with no treatment.
RESULTS: In the treatment group, 32 out of 98 patients (33%) achieved an SVR. 
Patients infected with genotype 1 had a lower SVR than those infected with 
genotype non-1 (18% versus 49%, p = 0.02). No patients who failed to achieve a 
2-log drop in viral load at 12 weeks achieved an SVR. HRQoL fell during 
treatment and rose with treatment cessation. For patients having an SVR there 
were modest improvements in HRQoL at 6 months post-treatment. The mean cost per 
QALY gained was 4535 pounds sterling for 40-year-old patients with genotype 
non-1 and 25,188 pounds sterling for patients with genotype 1. For patients with 
genotype 1 aged 65, providing interferon-alpha and ribavirin for mild disease 
led to fewer QALYs gained, and a mean cost per QALY of 53,017 pounds sterling. 
The model using efficacy estimates from the literature, showed that the cost per 
QALY gained from providing pegylated interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin at a mild 
stage rather than a moderate stage was 7821 pounds sterling for patients with 
genotype non-1 and 28,409 pounds sterling for patients with genotype 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the evidence collected in this study, interferon-alpha and 
ribavirin treatment for mild chronic hepatitis C patients is in general 
cost-effective at the 30,000 pounds sterling per QALY threshold previously used 
by policy-makers in the NHS. For patients with chronic hepatitis C aged 65 or 
over with genotype 1, antiviral treatment at a mild stage does not appear 
cost-effective. Further research is required on the cost-effectiveness of 
pegylated interferon and ribavirin, in particular the intervention's long-term 
impact on HRQoL and health service costs requires further evaluation. Further 
research is also needed to develop predictive tests, based on pharmacogenomics, 
that can identify those cases most likely to respond to antiviral therapy. Liver 
biopsy before treatment no longer appears justified apart from for older 
patients (aged 65 or over) with genotype 1. However, further research should 
monitor the impact this strategy would have on costs and outcomes.

PURPOSE: The Dutch Bone Metastases Study Group developed a survival prediction 
model in patients with symptomatic spinal bone metastases to guide the treating 
physician. The objective of this study was to validate the Dutch model and 
compare with our previously developed survival model at the Rapid Response 
Radiotherapy Program (RRRP model).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The following prognostic factors were extracted from a 
prospective database in an outpatient palliative radiotherapy clinic: Karnofsky 
Performance Scores (KPS), primary cancer site, and visceral involvement for the 
Dutch model; primary cancer site, site of metastases, KPS, fatigue, appetite, 
and shortness of breath scores in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale for the 
RRRP model. Patients were assigned scores according to each model. The survival 
probabilities were generated and calibration was performed for each model.
RESULTS: A total of 231 patients with spinal bone metastases from 1999 and 2002 
were included in the analysis. The survival probabilities were similar to those 
in the original models. The calibration comparing actual survival with predicted 
survival from the Dutch and RRRP models gave R2 values of 0.90 and 0.86, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The two models were successfully validated. The Dutch model using 
three clinical prognostic factors was easier to administer.

Cost-effectiveness of screening for albuminuria with subsequent fosinopril 
treatment to prevent cardiovascular events: A pharmacoeconomic analysis linked 
to the prevention of renal and vascular endstage disease (PREVEND) study and the 
prevention of renal and vascular endstage disease intervention trial (PREVEND 
IT).

OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the cost-effectiveness,from the Dutch health 
care perspective, of screening for albuminuria in the general Dutch population 
to prevent cardiovascular events (CVEs) with subsequent angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor treatment, using data from the Prevention of REnal and Vascular 
ENdstage Disease Intervention Trial (PREVEND IT).
METHODS: PREVEND IT was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design within the larger 
observational Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENdstage Disease (PREVEND) study. 
The PREVEND IT study was conducted to assess the effects of fosinopril 20 mg and 
pravastatin 40 mg on CVEs in subjects with specific inclusion criteria: urinary 
albumin excretion (UAE) rate in the range from 15 to 300 mg/d, blood pressure 
<160/100 mm Hg, and plasma cholesterol level <8.0 mmol/L. Cost-effectiveness 
estimates for the Dutch population were expressed in euros (2002; 1 euro = US 
1.01 dollars) as net costs per life-year gained (LYG) in the baseline and 
sensitivity (stochastic) analyses.
RESULTS: Data were assessed for 864 subjects, with a mean (SD) follow-up of 46 
(7) months. CVEs occurred in 45 (5.2%) subjects. Subjects who received 
fosinopril had a 40% lower incidence of CVEs than subjects in the placebo group 
(3.9% vs 6.5%, respectively; P = NS). The cost-effectiveness of screening for 
albumnuria was determined to be euro 16,700/LYG for the study population. 
Stochastic analysis indicated that the probability of the cost-effectiveness 
being below the suggested Dutch threshold of euro 20,000/LYG was 59% in the 
baseline analysis. The probability of cost-effectiveness below euro 20,000/LYG 
would increase to 91% if only subjects with UAE >50 mg/d were treated with 
fosinopril. Limiting the screening to subjects aged >50 years and >60 years also 
improved cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that screening the general Dutch 
population for albuminuria and subsequently treating those found positive with 
fosinopril may be cost-effective compared with no screening and adopting the 
Dutch health care perspective. However, confirmation from larger multicenter 
trials is needed.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the cost implications of the implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), using utilization, cost, and survival data 
from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT)-II.
BACKGROUND: This trial showed that prophylactic implantation of a defibrillator 
reduces the rate of mortality in patients who experienced a previous myocardial 
infarction and low left ventricular ejection fraction. Given the size of the 
eligible population, the cost effectiveness of the ICD has substantial 
implications.
METHODS: Our research comprises the cost-effectiveness component of the 
randomized controlled trial, MADIT-II, based on utilization, cost, and survival 
information from 1,095 U.S. patients who were assigned randomly to receive an 
ICD or conventional medical care. Utilization data were converted to costs using 
a variety of national and hospital-specific data. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (iCER) was calculated as the difference in discounted 
costs divided by the difference in discounted life expectancy within 3.5 years. 
Secondary analyses included projections of survival (using three alternative 
assumptions), corresponding cost assumptions, and the resulting 
cost-effectiveness ratios until 12 years after randomization.
RESULTS: During the 3.5-year period of the study, the average survival gain for 
the defibrillator arm was 0.167 years (2 months), the additional costs were 
39,200 dollars, and the iCER was 235,000 dollars per year-of-life saved. In 
three alternative projections to 12 years, this ratio ranged from 78,600 dollars 
to 114,000 dollars.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated cost per life-year saved by the ICD in the MADIT-II 
study is relatively high at 3.5 years but is projected to be substantially lower 
over the course of longer time horizons.

A conserved MST-FOXO signaling pathway mediates oxidative-stress responses and 
extends life span.

Oxidative stress influences cell survival and homeostasis, but the mechanisms 
underlying the biological effects of oxidative stress remain to be elucidated. 
Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase MST1 mediates 
oxidative-stress-induced cell death in primary mammalian neurons by directly 
activating the FOXO transcription factors. MST1 phosphorylates FOXO proteins at 
a conserved site within the forkhead domain that disrupts their interaction with 
14-3-3 proteins, promotes FOXO nuclear translocation, and thereby induces cell 
death in neurons. We also extend the MST-FOXO signaling link to nematodes. 
Knockdown of the C. elegans MST1 ortholog CST-1 shortens life span and 
accelerates tissue aging, while overexpression of cst-1 promotes life span and 
delays aging. The cst-1-induced life-span extension occurs in a daf-16-dependent 
manner. The identification of the FOXO transcription factors as major and 
evolutionarily conserved targets of MST1 suggests that MST kinases play 
important roles in diverse biological processes including cellular responses to 
oxidative stress and longevity.

The purpose of this study was to compare in clinical and economic terms the 
long-acting insulin analogue detemir with intermediate-acting Neutral Protamine 
Hagedorn (NPH) insulin and with long-acting insulin glargine. Investigators used 
the validated Center for Outcomes Research (CORE) Diabetes Model to project 
clinical and cost outcomes over a 35-year base case time horizon; outcome data 
were extracted directly from randomized, controlled trials designed to compare 
detemir with NPH and with insulin glargine. Modeled patient characteristics were 
derived from corresponding trials, and simulations incorporated published 
quality-of-life utilities with cost data obtained from a Medicare perspective. 
Detemir, when compared with NPH, increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 
0.698 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Lifetime direct medical costs were 
increased by 10,451 dollars per patient, although indirect costs were reduced by 
4688 dollars. On the basis of direct costs, the cost per QALY gained with 
detemir was 14,974 dollars. In comparison with glargine, detemir increased 
quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.063 QALYs, reduced direct medical costs by 
2072 dollars per patient, and decreased indirect costs by 3103 dollars 
(dominant). Reductions in diabetes-related comorbidities were also associated 
with detemir in both instances, most notably in the complications of retinopathy 
and nephropathy. Relative reductions in rates of complications were greatest in 
the comparison of detemir with NPH. Results were most sensitive to variation in 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. However, variation among any of the key 
assumptions, including HbA1c, did not alter the relative results. Detemir 
represents an attractive clinical and economic intervention in the US health 
care setting compared with both NPH insulin and insulin glargine.

BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is common and, when undiagnosed, may result in 
increased mortality, suggesting that mass screening could be justified. The 
authors examined the cost-effectiveness (CE) of such an approach, assuming a 
higher mortality rate in undiagnosed CD and that adhering to a gluten-free diet 
(GFD) reduces the mortality rate.
METHODS: The authors developed a state transition Markov model, evaluating the 
CE of screening an entire population at the age of 18. Screening strategies 
included no screening v. screening by IgA antiendomysial antibodies (EMA), IgA 
human antitissue transglutaminase antibodies (TTG), and TTG verified by EMA. All 
strategies were examined with and without evaluation for IgA deficiency, and 
they all included an intestinal biopsy. Effects of variables were examined using 
sensitivity analysis. Effectiveness was assessed by life expectancy for each 
strategy and the incremental average CE ratio for each.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis revealed US$49,491 and US$572,616 per life year 
gained for screening compared to no screening using EMA or TTG, respectively. 
The CE of screening with EMA was most influenced by the prevalence of CD and the 
standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for untreated CD patients. Screening was 
cost-effective in populations with a relatively high prevalence of CD or when 
the SMR for untreated CD patients was higher than 1.5. The model was insensitive 
to changes in the cost of serological markers and diagnostic endoscopy.
CONCLUSION: Assuming an SMR of 1.5 or higher for untreated CD patients, mass 
screening for CD is cost-effective in populations with a relatively high 
prevalence of CD over a wide range of ages at screening. From a CE perspective, 
EMA is the preferred serological marker for mass screening. Screening for CD 
would be justified only if the uncertainties regarding the validity of our 
assumptions are substantiated.

Light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is characterized by immunoglobulin light-chain 
fragments aggregating into amyloid fibrils that deposit extracellularly in vital 
organs such as the kidney, the heart, and the liver, resulting in tissue 
degeneration and organ failure, leading to death. Cardiac involvement is found 
in 50% of AL patients and presents the most severe cases with a life expectancy 
of less than a year after diagnosis. In this study, we have characterized the 
variable domain of a cardiac AL patient light chain called AL-09. AL-09 folds as 
a beta-sheet and is capable of forming amyloid fibrils both in the presence of 
sodium sulfate and in self-seeded reactions under physiological conditions. 
Glycosaminoglycans such as dermatan sulfate and heparin promote amyloid 
formation of self-seeded AL-09 reactions, while the glycosaminoglycan 
chondroitin sulfate A stabilized oligomeric intermediates and did not elongate 
the preformed fibrils (nucleus) present in the reaction. Finally, the 
histological dye Congo red, known to bind to the cross beta-sheet structure of 
amyloid fibrils, inhibits AL-09 amyloid fibril formation in the presence of 
sodium sulfate and in self-seeded reactions. This paper provides insight into 
the impact of different reagents on light-chain stability, structure, amyloid 
fibril formation, and inhibition.

BACKGROUND: In the last decade of the 20th century, a considerable effort has 
been put into the development of summary measures of population health that 
combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. We used the 
DALYs (Disability adjusted life years) method to assess the burden of disease 
and injury in the population of Serbia.
METHODS: Our study, largely based on the methods developed for the Global burden 
of disease study, was conducted between October 2002 and September 2003. DALYs, 
stratified by gender and age, were calculated for 18 selected health conditions 
for the population of Serbia, Serbia and Montenegro for 2000. Years of life lost 
(YLL) were calculated using country mortality statistics, while years lived with 
disability (YLD) were calculated using different sources of information. Also, 
the YLD/YYL ratio and age-adjusted rates of DALYs were calculated.
RESULTS: Ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, lung cancer, 
unipolar depressive disorders, and diabetes mellitus were responsible for almost 
two-thirds (70%) of the total burden of 18 selected disorders in Serbia 2000. 
The leading five causes for males were ischaemic heart disease (26.1 DALY per 
1000), stroke (17.9), lung cancer (12.7), road traffic accidents (6.5), and 
self-inflicted injuries (5.5). For females, the leading five causes were stroke 
(18.1 DALY per 1000), ischaemic heart disease (14.1), depression (8.7), breast 
cancer (6.1), and diabetes mellitus (5.2).
CONCLUSIONS: The final results of the study have shown that the national health 
priority areas should cover cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and mental health.

Given the need to assess the value for money of healthcare treatments, economic 
evaluation has been gaining popularity over the past ten years. Studies 
comparing the costs and consequences of alternative healthcare interventions 
have been published in all fields of healthcare. This article describes the 
basic forms of economic evaluation and outlines the key methodological features 
to be considered in the critical appraisal of studies. Issues such as the 
appropriateness of the study question, the selection of alternatives to be 
compared, the measurement of costs and consequences, and the assessment of 
uncertainty are discussed. Additionally, an analytical critique of economic 
evaluations undertaken in Singapore is provided, and the prospects for economic 
evaluation in the future are discussed.

In developed countries, antiretroviral treatment has increased life quality and 
expectancy of HIV-infected individuals and led to a drop in mother-to-child 
transmission (MCT) risk to below 1%. Fertility has been shown to be reduced in 
both men and women with HIV. As a result of these factors, the demand for 
reproductive care in this population is rising. In discordant couples where the 
man is positive, sperm washing significantly reduces viral transmission risk to 
the uninfected female partner over unprotected intercourse. Positive women do 
not necessarily need specialised fertility treatment but should be monitored 
closely during pregnancy to minimise MCT risk.

[What are the main errors made by surgeons in the management of pancreatic 
cancer?].

la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain. jumanjico@yahoo.com

The present review identifies two major conceptual errors. Therapeutic nihilism, 
which should be discounted in view of the results currently achieved by surgery, 
and noncentralization, since better results have been demonstrated, both in 
terms of morbidity and mortality and in survival, in high-volume centers than in 
low volume centers. The present review also identifies errors in management, the 
most important of which are: undervaluing the medical record, which is of great 
utility and continues to be the pillar on which the entire diagnostic process is 
based; the systematic use of preoperative biliary drainage, which used to be 
considered mandatory but should be used highly selectively in patients with 
severe jaundice or biliary tract infections, and viewing preoperative imaging 
tests as unreliable, when current radiological techniques, particularly helical 
computed tomography (CT), are highly reliable in establishing tumor 
resectability and consequently they should be used in all treatment planning. 
Moreover, because radiological tests are highly reliable, laparoscopic staging 
has lost diagnostic value; obtaining a preoperative histological diagnosis, 
which is not mandatory except when neoadjuvant therapy is planned or when tumors 
requiring nonsurgical treatment are suspected; undervaluing the use of surgical 
palliation, since this technique provides better long-term results than 
nonsurgical palliation, and consequently still plays a role in patients with 
good general health status and prolonged life expectancy; systematically 
performing gastrojejunostomy with bilio-enteric bypass, as this procedure should 
only be performed in tumors of the uncus or when there is imminent biliary or 
gastroduodenal obstruction; the use of supraradical surgical techniques such as 
regional, total or extensive pancreatectomy, since these techniques do not 
prolong survival after resection. Furthermore, the use of vascular resections 
would only be justified if resection with disease-free margins could be 
performed; undervaluing close postoperative monitoring within specialized units 
since this is the key to reducing morbidity and mortality rates in this type of 
surgery; and lastly when an intraoperative pancreatic incidentaloma is present, 
performing diagnostic maneuvers such as biopsy or pancreatic mobilization, since 
these procedures hamper subsequent radiological interpretation and possible 
surgical intervention.

INTRODUCTION: The complications of surgical wound closure in patients with risk 
factors significantly increases morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present 
study was to evaluate differences in abdominal wall closure in patients with 
risk factors with the same closure technique and slow-absorbable or 
non-absorbable sutures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, comparative study 
of polydioxanone versus nylon sutures. Laparotomies performed for intestinal 
diseases and hepatobiliopancreatic procedures in patients with at least one risk 
factor were included. Exclusions criteria were eventrations, interventions for 
obesity, the need for reinforcement sutures, uncommon incisions, life expectancy 
of less than 1.5 years and deaths unrelated to the wound. Closure was performed 
with monoplane, extracutaneous, continuous, en bloc, loop sutures. Infection, 
evisceration, dehiscence, extrusion, sinus, eventration, intolerance, and pain 
were evaluated. Postoperative follow-up was performed at 10 and 30 days, 3 and 6 
months, and at 1 and 1.5 years.
RESULTS: A total of 770 patients were included (451 in the polydioxanone group 
and 319 in the nylon group). A total of 78.05% were midline incisions, with a 
mean length of 23.3 cm. Caliber 1 sutures were most frequently used (85.45%), 
and 1.7 sutures were used per patient. No complications occurred in 94.03% with 
no differences between groups (94.7% polydioxanone and 93.1% nylon). The results 
were similar throughout follow-up. The surgical infection rate was 10%. No 
differences were found in any of the follow-up assessments in any of the 
variables analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal wall closure should be performed with continuous 
slow-absorption sutures such as polydioxanone since this type of suture has a 
similar complication rate to reabsorbable sutures and presents greater 
biocompatibility.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the cumulative endometriosis recurrence 
rate (CERR) after fertility surgery for endometriosis stage III or IV is 
increased in women exposed to very high E(2) levels during ovarian 
hyperstimulation (OH) for IVF when compared with women exposed to less high E(2) 
levels during OH for intrauterine insemination (IUI).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study including infertility patients with 
endometriosis stage III or IV.
SETTING: Leuven University Fertility Center, between 1990 and 2001.
PATIENT(S): Patients (n = 67) with endometriosis stage III (n = 45) or IV (n = 
22) who underwent pelvic reconstructive surgery and subsequently started 
fertility treatment with either IVF only (n = 39), both IVF and IUI in different 
cycles (n = 11), or IUI only (n = 17).
INTERVENTION(S): Life table analysis was used to calculate the CERR.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The CERR based on histologic or cytologic proof of 
disease recurrence.
RESULT(S): At 21 months after the start of OH the overall CERR was 31% and was 
significantly lower in patients treated with IVF only (7%) or women treated with 
both IVF and IUI in different cycles (43 %) than in those treated with IUI only 
(70%). At 36 months after the start of OH, the overall CERR was 63%.
CONCLUSION(S): In contrast to our hypothesis, the results from this study showed 
that the CERR is lower after ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF than after 
lower-dose ovarian stimulation for IUI, suggesting that temporary exposure to 
very high E(2) levels in women during OH for IVF is not a major risk factor for 
endometriosis recurrence in women treated with assisted reproductive technology.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between mortalities in African countries 
and problems that emerged in Africa in the 1990s (reduction of national income, 
HIV/AIDS and political instability) by adjusting for the influences of 
development, sanitation and education.
METHODS: We compiled country-level indicators of mortalities, national net 
income (the reduction of national income by the debt), infection rate of 
HIV/AIDS, political instability, demography, education, sanitation and 
infrastructure, from 1990 to 2000 of all African countries (n=53). To extract 
major factors from indicators of the latter four categories, we carried out 
principal component analysis. We used multiple regression analysis to examine 
the associations between mortality indicators and national net income per 
capita, infection rate of HIV/AIDS, and political instability by adjusting the 
influence of other possible mortality determinants.
RESULTS: Mean of infant mortality per 1000 live births (IMR); maternal mortality 
per 100,000 live birth (MMR); adult female mortality per 1000 population (AMRF); 
adult male mortality per 1000 population (AMRM); and life expectancy at birth 
(LE) in 2000 were 83, 733, 381, 435, and 51, respectively. Three factors were 
identified as major influences on development: education, sanitation and 
infrastructure. National net income per capita showed independent negative 
associations with MMR and AMRF, and a positive association with LE. Infection 
rate of HIV/AIDS was independently positively associated with AMRM and AMRF, and 
negatively associated with LE in 2000. Political instability score was 
independently positively associated with MMR.
CONCLUSIONS: National net income per capita, HIV/AIDS and political status were 
predictors of mortality indicators in African countries. This study provided 
evidence for supporting health policies that take economic and political 
stability into account.

Novel neuroprotective, neuritogenic and anti-amyloidogenic properties of 
2,4-dinitrophenol: the gentle face of Janus.

De Felice FG(1), Ferreira ST.

In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of gates, doors, beginnings and endings. 
He was usually depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions. Janus was 
frequently used to symbolize change and transitions, such as the progression 
from past to future or from one viewpoint to another. 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) 
and other nitrophenols have long been known to be toxic at high concentrations 
(the 'bad' face of DNP), an effect that appears essentially related to 
interference with cellular energy metabolism due to uncoupling of mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation. Five years ago, however, we published the first 
report showing that low concentrations of DNP protect neurons against the 
toxicity of the amyloid-beta peptide (De Felice et al. (2001) FASEB J. 15:1297 - 
1299]. Since then, other studies have provided evidence of beneficial actions of 
DNP (at low concentrations), including neuroprotection against different types 
of insult, blockade of amyloid aggregation, stimulation of neurite outgrowth and 
neuronal differentiation, and even extension of lifespan in certain organisms. 
Some of these effects appear to be due to mild mitochondrial uncoupling and 
prevention of cellular oxidative stress, whereas other actions are related to 
activation of additional intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, a novel and 
'gentle' face of DNP is emerging from such studies. In this review, we discuss 
both toxic and beneficial actions of DNP. The evidence available so far suggests 
that DNP and other compounds with similar biological activities may be of 
significant interest to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for 
neurodegenerative diseases and other neurological disorders.

BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can 
determine the extent of myocardial scar from infarction (MI). However, the 
prognostic significance of unrecognized myocardial scar by CMR in patients 
without a history of MI is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred ninety-five patients without a known prior MI 
underwent CMR for assessment of left ventricular (LV) function and late 
gadolinium enhancement (LGE). We assessed the prognostic value of LGE and other 
CMR variables beyond the strongest clinical predictors and built the best 
overall models for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiac mortality. 
During a median follow-up of 16 months, 31 patients (18%) experienced MACE, 
including 17 deaths. LGE demonstrated the strongest unadjusted associations with 
MACE and cardiac mortality (hazard ratios of 8.29 and 10.9, respectively; both 
P<0.0001). Patients in the lowest tertile of LGE-involved myocardium (mean LV 
mass, 1.4%) experienced a >7-fold increased risk for MACE. By multivariable 
analyses, LGE was independently associated with MACE beyond the clinical model 
(P<0.0001) or the clinical model combined with angiographically significant 
coronary stenosis (P=0.0007), LV ejection fraction (P=0.001), LV end-systolic 
volume index (P=0.0006), or segmental WMA (P=0.002). LGE remained the strongest 
predictor selected in the best overall models for MACE and cardiac mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease 
but without a history of MI, LGE involving a small amount of myocardium carries 
a high cardiac risk. In addition, LGE provides incremental prognostic value to 
MACE and cardiac mortality beyond common clinical, angiographic, and functional 
predictors.

The role of global risk assessment in hypertension therapy.

To maximize the benefits of preventive therapy, lipid and hypertension 
guidelines increasingly recommend that high-risk individuals be targeted for 
treatment. An individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease depends on 
many risk factors, such as age, sex, blood pressure, blood lipid levels, body 
weight, physical fitness, smoking habits and familial predisposition. 
Multivariable statistical models have therefore been developed to better 
estimate the global risk of future coronary events and stroke. A Canadian model 
is not currently available because a prospective cohort of sufficient size has 
not been followed in Canada. Therefore, global risk assessment among Canadians 
can only be completed using models developed in the United States or Europe. In 
the present review, cardiovascular risk tools are identified that may be 
appropriate for Canadians, including those based on the Framingham model, the 
Cardiovascular Life Expectancy Model, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes 
Study (UKPDS) model and the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) model. 
The accuracy of the Framingham model and the Cardiovascular Life Expectancy 
Model are also evaluated using data from a small, prospective Canadian cohort. 
Finally, a framework is proposed to assist health care professionals in choosing 
the global risk tool most appropriate for their patients.

Pour maximiser les bienfaits de la thérapie préventive, les lignes directrices 
sur la lipidémie et l’hypertension recommandent de plus en plus de cibler les 
personnes très vulnérables pour les traiter. Le risque personnel de souffrir 
d’une maladie cardiovasculaire dépend de nombreux facteurs de risque, tels que 
l’âge, le sexe, la tension artérielle, le taux de lipides sanguins, le poids, la 
condition physique, les habitudes reliées au tabagisme et les prédispositions 
familiales. Des modèles statistiques multivariables ont donc été mis au point 
pour mieux évaluer le risque global de futurs problèmes coronariens et accidents 
vasculaires cérébraux. Il n’existe pas de modèle canadien parce qu’aucune 
cohorte de taille suffisante n’a été suivie au Canada. Par conséquent, 
l’évaluation globale du risque chez les Canadiens ne peut être effectuée qu’à
