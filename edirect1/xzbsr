years, well below the chronologic age (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: In Portuguese centenarians, clinical and nutritional approach should 
be improved on the gender basis. In relation to nutritional status, centenarians 
were more frequently underweight than overweight. The thinness could be a 
natural process, contributing for the longevity being rather overweight a 
reducing factor in life expectancy. BMI and waist circumference showed a good 
correlation with body fat percentage. Despite the results of Bland- Altman 
analysis, Deurenberg and Gallagher equations are not suitable to evaluate 
obesity prevalence in centenarians. Harris Benedict equation seems to be a good 
option to measure RMR in centenaries, when BIA is not available. Body 
composition and nutritional characterization of Portuguese centenarians are 
relevant contribution in scientific evidence production for the action plan of 
healthy ageing in Europe (2012-2020) and also for clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: A universal, publicly funded, school-based human papillomavirus 
(HPV) vaccination program in grade eight girls was initiated in Ontario in 2007. 
We present a cost-utility analysis of integrated cervical cancer prevention 
programs from the healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: Our analysis was based on linked HPV transmission and disease history 
models. We obtained data from the literature, provincial surveys and Ontario 
population-based linked health administrative datasets. We modeled combinations 
of vaccination and screening strategies. We considered vaccination based on the 
Ontario experience, as well as conservative and optimistic scenarios, varying 
coverage, vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection. We considered 900 
screening scenarios (screening start age: 21-70 years, screening interval: 3-20 
years; 1-year time steps). The current schedule screens every 3 years starting 
at age 21 years. We examined (1) first vaccinated cohort (low herd-immunity), 
and (2) steady state, i.e. all cohorts were vaccinated (high herd-immunity).
RESULTS: Adding vaccination to the current screening schedule was cost-effective 
(<C$10,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) across all scenarios. Delaying 
screening start and/or extending screening intervals increased both expected 
QALYs and cost, and increased overall NHB for screening schedules with a start 
age of 25-35 years and 3-10-year intervals for most scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Delaying screening start age and/or extending screening intervals in 
vaccinated cohorts is likely to be cost-effective. Consideration should be given 
to both the short- and long-term implications of health policy decisions, 
particularly for infectious disease interventions that require long time 
intervals to reach steady state.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (Kadcyla(®); Roche) to submit 
evidence of its clinical and cost-effectiveness for treating human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, unresectable, locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane. The 
School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at 
the University of Sheffield were the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) who 
produced a critical review of the company's submission to NICE. The ERG also 
independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the submitted decision 
analytic model to produce a revised estimate of cost-effectiveness and examine 
the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. The clinical effectiveness 
data were taken from two randomised controlled trials that reported a 
significant advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) for T-DM1 over 
lapatinib in combination with capecitabine (EMILIA trial), and over the 
treatment of physician's choice (TH3RESA trial). A network meta-analysis 
suggested T-DM1 was the best treatment in terms of both overall survival and PFS 
compared with lapatinib in combination with capecitabine; trastuzumab in 
combination with capecitabine; and capecitabine monotherapy. Adverse event (AE) 
data were taken from a pooled analysis of additional trials of T-DM1 as a single 
agent. The most common grade 3 or greater AEs for T-DM1 were thrombocytopenia 
and hepatotoxicity. Following the clarification process, the manufacturer 
reported a deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for T-DM1 
compared with lapatinib in combination with capecitabine of £167,236, the latter 
of which was estimated to have an ICER of £49,798 compared with capecitabine 
monotherapy. The ERG produced similar values of £166,429 and £50,620 
respectively. All other comparators were dominated. During the appraisal, the 
manufacturer offered an analysis of a patient access scheme (PAS), which 
suggested that T-DM1 had a 0 % probability of being cost-effective at an ICER of 
£30,000 per QALY gained. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that while the 
clinical effectiveness of T-DM1 had been proven, it was not likely to represent 
a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources and therefore its use 
could not be recommended.

Optimal breast cancer screening strategies for older women: current 
perspectives.

Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths among older women, aged 
65 years or older. Screening mammography has been shown to be effective in 
reducing breast cancer mortality in women aged 50-74 years but not among those 
aged 75 years or older. Given the large heterogeneity in comorbidity status and 
life expectancy among older women, controversy remains over screening 
mammography in this population. Diminished life expectancy with aging may 
decrease the potential screening benefit and increase the risk of harms. In this 
review, we summarize the evidence on screening mammography utilization, 
performance, and outcomes and highlight evidence gaps. Optimizing the screening 
strategy will involve separating older women who will benefit from screening 
from those who will not benefit by using information on comorbidity status and 
life expectancy. This review has identified areas related to screening 
mammography in older women that warrant additional research, including the need 
to evaluate emerging screening technologies, such as tomosynthesis among older 
women and precision cancer screening. In the absence of randomized controlled 
trials, the benefits and harms of continued screening mammography in older women 
need to be estimated using both population-based cohort data and simulation 
models.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a co-dominantly inherited disorder of 
plasma lipoprotein metabolism. The prevalence of heterozygous FH (HeFH) is 
between 1/500 and 1/200 whereas that of homozygous form (HoFH) is about 
1/1,000,000. Diagnosis is based on cutaneous xanthomas and untreated levels of 
LDL-cholesterol over 500 mg/dl before 10 years of age. Life expectancy, without 
treatment, does not exceed 20 years of age. The aim of this study is to 
characterise in details a cohort of 8 HoFH paediatric patients in order to 
illustrate all the current therapeutic options and to add some clinical and 
genetic information about this rare disease. We collected demographic, clinical, 
biological, imaging and genotype details. Furthermore, clinical and biochemical 
response to different treatment methods was retrospectively evaluated. All 
patients had genetically proven HoFH. All patients were subject to a 
lipid-lowering diet and medical treatment (except one), three patients underwent 
a liver transplant and one an hepatocytes infusion. Medical treatment was well 
tolerated with a median reduction of 44% and 47% in LDL-Cholesterol and Total 
Cholesterol respectively. The hepatocytes transplant produced a further, though 
slight, decrease in cholesterol levels as opposed to medical therapy alone. 
Transplanted patients normalized their cholesterol levels. Since the very high 
cardiovascular risk, HoFH requires immediate diagnosis, treatment and 
monitoring. Nowadays, the use of statins remains the cornerstone of medical 
therapy and liver transplantation is the possibly curative therapy. Besides, 
high hopes are pinned in new drugs (antibody targeting PCSK9, Mipomersen and 
Lomitapide) and stem cells.

BACKGROUND: Rapid drug desensitization (RDD) is used to address hypersensitivity 
reactions to chemotherapeutics and monoclonal antibodies, allowing patients to 
be treated with optimal pharmacological agents. RDD protocols are tailored to 
each individual patient's reaction and needs, and protect against anaphylaxis, 
but overall risks, costs, and benefits have not been determined.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the safety, efficacy, costs, and life expectancy of 
patients in a large population undergoing RDD.
METHODS: We analyzed 2177 RDD procedures performed in 370 patients with cancer, 
vasculitis, and hematological and connective tissue diseases who presented 402 
reactions. A subgroup of carboplatin allergic patients with ovarian cancer 
treated with RDD was analyzed for costs and life expectancy and compared with a 
nonallergic control group.
RESULTS: RDD allowed all patients to receive safely the full dose of the 
medication to which they were reactive. A gradual increase in the fraction of 
outpatient desensitizations from 81% to 98% was achieved through risk 
stratification. Of the 2177 desensitizations, 93% had no or mild reactions 
whereas 7% had moderate to severe reactions, which did not preclude the 
completion of the treatment, and there were no deaths. Overall health costs in 
the carboplatin allergic group were not higher than those in the nonallergic 
group treated with standard of care. Administration of carboplatin through RDD 
was as effective as standard administration with a nonsignificant increase in 
life expectancy in desensitized patients as compared with nonallergic, 
nondesensitized controls.
CONCLUSIONS: RDD is cost effective and safe for allergic patients with cancer 
and chronic disease to remain on first line therapy.

Pulmonary hypertension is a well recognised complication of chronic hypoxic lung 
diseases, which are among the most common causes of death and disability 
worldwide. Development of pulmonary hypertension independently predicts reduced 
life expectancy. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term oxygen 
therapy ameliorates pulmonary hypertension and greatly improves survival, 
although the correction of alveolar hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension is only 
partial. Advances in understanding of the regulation of vascular smooth muscle 
tone show that chronic vasoconstriction plays a more important part in the 
pathogenesis of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension than previously thought, and that 
structural vascular changes contribute less. Trials of existing vasodilators 
show that pulmonary hypertension can be ameliorated and systemic oxygen delivery 
improved in carefully selected patients, although systemic hypotensive effects 
limit the doses used. Vasoconstrictor pathways that are selective for the 
pulmonary circulation can be blocked to reduce hypoxic pulmonary hypertension 
without causing systemic hypotension, and thus provide potential targets for 
novel therapeutic strategies.

The life expectancy and average age of persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) have 
increased significantly during the last two decades. The introduction of 
disease-modifying therapies and a better delineation and understanding of the 
superimposed comorbidities often diagnosed in MS patients are probably the most 
important factors accountable for the increase in aging MS population worldwide. 
Healthcare teams must therefore address the problems arising due to advancing 
age superimposed on this chronic neurologic disease. In this review, we focus on 
the physiology of aging, its effects on MS disease course, and the pathological 
and immunological changes associated with aging and disease progression. 
Additionally, we discuss the common comorbidities that occur in aging persons 
with MS that may arise either as a result of the aging process or from 
relentless chronic MS disease progression as well as the challenges on 
differentiating the two processes for a more appropriate therapeutic approach.

Does Social Context Matter? Income Inequality, Racialized Identity, and Health 
Among Canada's Aboriginal Peoples Using a Multilevel Approach.

OBJECTIVES: Debates surrounding the importance of social context versus 
individual level processes have a long history in public health. Aboriginal 
peoples in Canada are very diverse, and the reserve communities in which they 
reside are complex mixes of various cultural and socioeconomic circumstances. 
The social forces of these communities are believed to affect health, in 
addition to individual level determinants, but no large scale work has ever 
probed their relative effects. One aspect of social context, relative 
deprivation, as indicated by income inequality, has greatly influenced the 
social determinants of health landscape. An investigation of relative 
deprivation in Canada's Aboriginal population has never been conducted. This 
paper proposes a new model of Aboriginal health, using a multidisciplinary 
theoretical approach that is multilevel.
METHODS: This study explored the self-rated health of respondents using two 
levels of determinants, contextual and individual. Data were from the 2001 
Aboriginal Peoples Survey. There were 18,890 Registered First Nations (subgroup 
of Aboriginal peoples) on reserve nested within 134 communities. The model was 
assessed using a hierarchical generalized linear model.
RESULTS: There was no significant variation at the contextual level. 
Subsequently, a sequential logistic regression analysis was run. With the sole 
exception culture, demographics, lifestyle factors, formal health services, and 
social support were significant in explaining self-rated health.
CONCLUSIONS: The non-significant effect of social context, and by extension 
relative deprivation, as indicated by income inequality, is noteworthy, and the 
primary role of individual level processes, including the material conditions, 
social support, and lifestyle behaviors, on health outcomes is illustrated. It 
is proposed that social structure is best conceptualized as a dynamic 
determinant of health inequality and more multilevel theoretical models of 
Aboriginal health should be developed and tested.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy of an obese smoker is 13 years less than a normal 
weight smoker, which could be linked to the increased renal risk imposed by 
smoking. Both smoking-through nicotine (NIC)-and obesity-by free fatty acid 
overload-provoke oxidative stress in the kidney, which ultimately results in 
development of chronic kidney injury. Their combined renal risk, however, is 
virtually unknown. We tested the hypothesis that chronic NIC exposure worsens 
renal oxidative stress in mice on high-fat diet (HFD) by altering the balance 
between expression of pro-oxidant and antioxidant genes.
METHODS: Nine-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice consumed normal diet (ND) or HFD and 
received either NIC (200 μg/ml) or vehicle (2% saccharine) in their drinking 
water. Body weight, plasma clinical parameters, renal lipid deposition, markers 
of renal oxidative stress and injury, as well as renal expression of the 
pro-oxidant p66shc and the antioxidant MnSOD were determined after 12 weeks.
RESULTS: NIC significantly augmented levels of circulating free fatty acid, as 
well as lipid deposition, oxidative stress and sublethal injury in the kidneys 
of mice on HFD. In addition, NIC exposure suppressed HFD-mediated induction of 
MnSOD while increased expression of p66shc in the kidney.
CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking or the increasingly popular E-cigarettes-via NIC 
exposure-could worsen obesity-associated lipotoxicity in the kidney. Hence, our 
findings could help to develop strategies that mitigate adverse effects of NIC 
on the obese kidney.
IMPLICATIONS: Life expectancy of an obese smoker is 13 years less than a normal 
weight smoker, which could be linked to the increased renal risk imposed by 
smoking. NIC-the main component of tobacco smoke, E-cigarettes and replacement 
therapies-links smoking to renal injury via oxidative stress, which could 
superimpose renal oxidative stress caused by obesity. Our results substantiate 
this scenario using a mouse model of diet induced obesity and NIC exposure and 
imply the augmented long-term renal risk in obese smokers. Also, our study may 
help to develop strategies that mitigate adverse effects of NIC on the obese 
kidney.

The search for elixir of immortality has yielded mixed results. While some of 
the interventions like percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary artery 
bypass grafting have been a huge disappointment at least as far as prolongation 
of life is concerned, their absolute benefit is meager and that too in very sick 
patients. Cardiac specific drugs like statins and aspirin have fared slightly 
better, being useful in patients with manifest coronary artery disease, 
particularly in sicker populations although even their usefulness in primary 
prevention is rather low. The only strategies of proven benefit in 
primary/primordial prevention are pursuing a healthy life-style and its 
modification when appropriate, like cessation of smoking, weight reduction, 
increasing physical activity, eating a healthy diet and bringing blood pressure, 
serum cholesterol, and blood glucose under control.

intraspecific genotypes, called inducers, is unique to Zea maysL. within the 
plant kingdom and has revolutionized maize breeding during the last decade. 
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HI in maize are still unclear. To 
investigate the genetic basis of HI, we developed a new approach for genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS), termed conditional haplotype extension (CHE) test 
that allows detection of selective sweeps even under almost perfect confounding 
of population structure and trait expression. Here, we applied this test to 
identify genomic regions required for HI expression and dissected the combined 
support interval (50.34 Mb) of the QTL qhir1, detected in a previous study, into 
two closely linked genomic segments relevant for HI expression. The first, 
termed qhir11(0.54 Mb), comprises an already fine-mapped region but was not 
diagnostic for differentiating inducers and noninducers. The second segment, 
termed qhir12(3.97 Mb), had a haplotype allele common to all 53 inducer lines 
but not found in any of the 1482 noninducers. By comparing resequencing data of 
one inducer with 14 noninducers, we detected in the qhir12 region three 
candidate genes involved in DNA or amino acid binding, however, none for qhir11 
We propose that the CHE test can be utilized in introgression breeding and 
different fields of genetics to detect selective sweeps in heterogeneous genetic 
backgrounds.

It is known that there is an ongoing increase in life expectancy worldwide, 
especially in the population older than 65years of age. Cardiac aging is 
characterized by a series of complex pathophysiological changes affecting 
myocardium at structural, cellular, molecular and functional levels. These 
changes make the aged myocardium more susceptible to stress, leading to a high 
prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, left 
ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease) in the elderly population. The 
aging process is genetically programmed but modified by environmental 
influences, so that the rate of aging can vary widely among people. We 
summarized the entire data concerning all the multifactorial changes in aged 
myocardium and highlighting the recent evidence for the pathophysiological basis 
of cardiac aging. Keeping an eye on the clinical side, this review will explore 
the potential implications of the age-related changes in the clinical management 
and on novel therapeutic strategies potentially deriving from the scientific 
knowledge currently acquired on cardiac aging process.

The fatality risk-money tradeoff that is the value of a statistical life (VSL) 
may vary with the nature of the fatality event. While all fatalities involve 
loss of future life expectancy, the morbidity effects and their duration may 
differ. This article analyzes fatality risks accompanied by morbidity effects of 
different duration to disentangle the mortality and morbidity components of VSL 
using data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). The VSL is 
comprised of the sum of the value of the fatality risk and the value of the 
morbidity risk. Labor market valuations of morbidity risks are positive, even 
for fatalities that are caused by traumatic injuries. The value of the fatality 
risk is the dominant component of VSL, rather than the value of the morbidity 
risk.

First introduced in 1946, radioactive iodine (I-131) produces short-range beta 
radiation with a half-life of 8 days. The physical properties of I-131 combined 
with the high degree of uptake in the differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) led 
to the use of I-131 as a therapeutic agent for DTC in adults. There are two 
indications for the potential use of I-131 therapy in pediatric thyroid 
disorders: nonsurgical treatment of hyperthyroidism owing to Graves' disease and 
the treatment of children with intermediate- and high-risk DTC. However, 
children are not just miniature adults. Not only are children and the pediatric 
thyroid gland more sensitive to radiation than adults but also the biologic 
behavior of DTC differs between children and adults as well. As opposed to 
adults, children with DTC typically present with advanced disease at diagnosis; 
yet, they respond rapidly to therapy and have an excellent prognosis that is 
significantly better than that in adult counterparts with advanced disease. 
Unfortunately, there are also higher rates of local and distant disease 
recurrence in children with DTC compared with adults, mandating lifelong 
surveillance. Further, children have a longer life expectancy during which the 
adverse effects of I-131 therapy may become manifest. Recognizing the 
differences between adults and children with DTC, the American Thyroid 
Association commissioned a task force of experts who developed and recently 
published a guideline to address the unique issues related to the management of 
thyroid nodules and DTC in children. This article reviews the epidemiology, 
diagnosis, staging, treatment, therapy-related effects, and suggestions for 
surveillance in children with DTC, focusing not only on the differences between 
adults and children with this disease but also on the latest recommendations 
from the inaugural pediatric management guidelines of the American Thyroid 
Association.

[Twenty Years' Experience of the Surgical Treatment of Giant Ascending Aortic 
Aneurysms].

[Article in Russian]

Charchan ER, Stepanenko AB, Gens AP, Skvorstov AA, Galeev NA, Belov YV.

Giant ascending aortic aneurysm is one of the worst lesions of the 
cardiovascular system. Timely surgical treatment provides the only chance to 
prolong the lives of such patients. Life expectancy without surgery in these 
patients is minimal; they die from a ruptured aneurysm or decompensation of 
organs and systems. In this paper, based on two decades' experience of treating 
patients with giant aneurysms of ascending aorta and aortic arch in B.V. 
Petrovsky National Research Center of Surgery we have assessed evaluated 
immediate results of surgery and proposed measures for prevention of possible 
complications. Out of 53 patients with giant. ascending aortic aneurysms 
spontaneous rupture after sternotomy or opening of the pericardium occurred in 5 
cases. Overall hospital mortality was 1.9%. Our results indicate that with the 
right tactics surgical repair of giant ascending aortic aneurysms can be 
performed with a low mortality. Preliminary cardiopulmonary bypass with 
peripheral cannulation and cooling prior to sternotomy for the possibility of 
circulatory arrest is a prerequisite of the prevention of fatal massive 
hemorrhage.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Portugal is estimated at 
1:8000 live births, although there is a lack of accurate statistics. The average 
life expectancy has been steadily increasing and CF is no longer an exclusively 
pediatric disease.
OBJECTIVES: Characterize the Portuguese adult population with the diagnosis of 
CF.
METHODS: Retrospective study based on clinical data of adult CF follow-up 
patients in the three specialized centers in Portugal where all of CF patients 
are seen, during 2012.
RESULTS: In 2012, there were 89 follow-up patients, 48 (54%) female and 15 (17%) 
lung transplanted. The average age was 31.3±9 years. The median age at diagnosis 
was 13 years and 34 (38%) were diagnosed in adulthood. The most frequent 
mutation was F508del (54.9%). Of the 89 patients, 49 patients (56%) had 
pancreatic insufficiency, 7 (9%) were diabetic and 42 patients (47.7%) had a 
body mass index (BMI) <20kg/m(2). As to ventilatory function, the average value 
of the forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) was 58.45±28.59%. Only one of 77 
patients did not have chronic airway infection. The most commonly isolated germ 
was methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in 49 patients (55%). During 
2012, two patients (2.2%) died at the ages of 21 and 36 years.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first description of the Portuguese adult CF 
population, which is particularly important since it can give us a better 
understanding of the real situation. A significant percentage of these patients 
were diagnosed in adulthood, which highlights the need for diagnostic suspicion 
in a patient with chronic lung disease and atypical manifestations.

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor being investigated for 
psoriasis.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to report longer-term tofacitinib efficacy and safety in 
patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.
METHODS: Data from 2 identical phase-III studies, Oral-treatment Psoriasis Trial 
Pivotal 1 and 2, were pooled with data from these patients in an ongoing 
open-label long-term extension study. Patients (n = 1861) were randomized 2:2:1 
to tofacitinib 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo twice daily (BID). At week 16, placebo 
patients were rerandomized to tofacitinib. Pivotal study participants could 
enroll into the long-term extension where they received tofacitinib at 10 mg BID 
for 3 months, after which dosing could be 5 or 10 mg BID.
RESULTS: At week 28, the proportions of patients randomized to tofacitinib 5 and 
10 mg BID achieving 75% or greater reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index score from baseline were 55.6% and 68.8%, and achieving Physician Global 
Assessment of clear or almost clear were 54.7% and 65.9%. Efficacy was 
maintained in most patients through 24 months. Serious adverse events and 
discontinuations because of adverse events were reported in less than 11% of 
patients over 33 months of tofacitinib exposure.
LIMITATIONS: There was no dose comparison beyond week 52.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral tofacitinib demonstrated sustained efficacy in patients with 
psoriasis through 2 years, with 10 mg BID providing greater efficacy than 5 mg 
BID. No unexpected safety findings were observed.

INTRODUCTION: The United States experienced a substantial increase in reported 
pertussis cases over the last decade. Since 2005, persons 11 years and older 
have been routinely recommended to receive a single dose of tetanus toxoid, 
reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. The objective 
of this analysis was to evaluate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of 
recommending a second dose of Tdap.
METHODS: A static cohort model was used to calculate the epidemiologic and 
economic impact of adding a second dose of Tdap at age 16 or 21 years. Projected 
costs and outcomes were examined from a societal perspective over a 20-year 
period. Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALY) saved were calculated.
RESULTS: Using baseline pertussis incidence from the National Notifiable 
Diseases Surveillance System, Tdap revaccination at either age 16 or 21 years 
would reduce outpatient visits by 433 (5%) and 285 (4%), and hospitalization 
cases by 7 (7%) and 5 (5%), respectively. The costs per QALY saved with a second 
dose of Tdap were approximately US $19.7 million (16 years) and $26.2 million 
(21 years). In sensitivity analyses, incidence most influenced the model; as 
incidence increased, the costs per QALY decreased. To a lesser degree, initial 
vaccine effectiveness and waning of effectiveness also affected cost outcomes. 
Multivariate sensitivity analyses showed that under a set of optimistic 
assumptions, the cost per QALY saved would be approximately $163,361 (16 years) 
and $204,556 (21 years).
CONCLUSION: A second dose of Tdap resulted in a slight decrease in the number of 
cases and other outcomes, and that trend is more apparent when revaccinating at 
age 16 years than at age 21 years. Both revaccination strategies had high dollar 
per QALY saved even under optimistic assumptions in a multivariate sensitivity 
analysis.

The evolution of labile traits in sex- and age-structured populations.

Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3PS, UK.

Many quantitative traits are labile (e.g. somatic growth rate, reproductive 
timing and investment), varying over the life cycle as a result of behavioural 
adaptation, developmental processes and plastic responses to the environment. At 
the population level, selection can alter the distribution of such traits across 
age classes and among generations. Despite a growing body of theoretical 
research exploring the evolutionary dynamics of labile traits, a data-driven 
framework for incorporating such traits into demographic models has not yet been 
developed. Integral projection models (IPMs) are increasingly being used to 
understand the interplay between changes in labile characters, life histories 
and population dynamics. One limitation of the IPM approach is that it relies on 
phenotypic associations between parents and offspring traits to capture 
inheritance. However, it is well-established that many different processes may 
drive these associations, and currently, no clear consensus has emerged on how 
to model micro-evolutionary dynamics in an IPM framework. We show how to embed 
quantitative genetic models of inheritance of labile traits into age-structured, 
two-sex models that resemble standard IPMs. Commonly used statistical tools such 
as GLMs and their mixed model counterparts can then be used for model 
parameterization. We illustrate the methodology through development of a simple 
model of egg-laying date evolution, parameterized using data from a population 
of Great tits (Parus major). We demonstrate how our framework can be used to 
project the joint dynamics of species' traits and population density. We then 
develop a simple extension of the age-structured Price equation (ASPE) for 
two-sex populations, and apply this to examine the age-specific contributions of 
different processes to change in the mean phenotype and breeding value. The 
data-driven framework we outline here has the potential to facilitate greater 
insight into the nature of selection and its consequences in settings where 
focal traits vary over the lifetime through ontogeny, behavioural adaptation and 
phenotypic plasticity, as well as providing a potential bridge between 
theoretical and empirical studies of labile trait variation.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness in one or both upper limbs is common in persons with 
previous polio, but there is very limited knowledge how it influences daily 
life.
OBJECTIVE: To assess muscle weakness and self-perceived disability of the upper 
limbs in persons with late effects of polio and evaluate their association.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTINGS: University hospital outpatient clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight persons (mean age 67, SD 16 years) with late effects 
of polio in their upper limbs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A fixed dynamometer (Biodex System 3 PRO dynamometer 
(Biodex Medical Systems Inc, Shirley, NY) was used to measure isometric shoulder 
abduction and elbow flexion, as well as isokinetic concentric elbow flexion and 
extension. A hand-held dynamometer (Grippit, Hägersten, Sweden) was used to 
measure isometric grip strength. The Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand 
(DASH) questionnaire was used to assess self-perceived disability of the upper 
limbs. The relationships between the measures were analyzed with the Spearman 
rank correlation coefficients (rho).
RESULTS: The participants were 20%-31% weaker in their more-affected upper limb 
compared with their less-affected limb. The DASH score was on average 33.5 (SD 
18.6), indicating a mild-to-moderate disability of their upper limbs. Changing a 
lightbulb overhead, carrying a heavy object, and performing recreational 
activities that required muscle force with the arms were perceived as most 
difficult. The correlations (rho) between the muscle strength measurements and 
DASH scores ranged from -0.46 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -0.10 to -0.71) 
to -0.61 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.80) for the more affected upper limb, and from 
-0.54 (95% CI -0.21 to -0.76) to -0.68 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.84) for the less 
affected upper limb (P < .05-.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with previous polio and muscle weakness in their upper 
limbs perceive difficulties to use their arms in daily life, especially when 
performing activities above their head and strenuous household or leisure 
activities. The fair-to-moderate correlations of muscle strength with 
self-perceived disability imply that the weakness can only partially explain the 
perceived disabilities of arm, shoulder and hand. Other factors are therefore 
important to consider in the rehabilitation of persons with late effects of 
polio and upper limb disability.
