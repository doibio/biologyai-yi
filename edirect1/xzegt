BACKGROUND: Lifespan extension has independently evolved several times during 
mammalian evolution, leading to the emergence of a group of long-lived animals. 
Though mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is 
shown as a central regulator of lifespan and aging, the underlying influence of 
mTOR pathway on the evolution of lifespan in mammals is not well understood.
RESULTS: Here, we performed evolution analyses of 72 genes involved in the mTOR 
network across 48 mammals to explore the underlying mechanism of lifespan 
extension. We identified a total of 20 genes with significant evolution signals 
unique to long-lived species, including 12 positively selected genes, four 
convergent evolution genes, and five longevity associated genes whose evolution 
rate related to the maximum lifespan (MLS). Of these genes, four positively 
selected genes, two convergent evolution genes and one longevity-associated gene 
were involved in the autophagy response and aging-related diseases, while eight 
genes were known as cancer genes, indicating the long-lived species might have 
evolved effective regulation mechanisms of autophagy and cancer to extend 
lifespan.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed genes with significant evolutionary signals 
unique to long-lived species, which provided new insight into the lifespan 
extension of mammals and might bring new strategies to extend human lifespan.

In Denmark, a 10-year plan for psychiatry has been agreed on. The content of the 
plan was developed in collaboration between the Danish Health Authority and the 
Danish Authority for Social Services and Housing, and it involved many 
stakeholders. Recently, the government presented a planned investment that would 
increase the overall budget in Danish regions and municipalities by almost 20 
percent over a 10-year period. Epidemiological research demonstrating shortened 
life expectancy and high levels of burden of disease for people with mental 
disorders contributed to emphasizing the need for improvement of psychiatric 
services. User organizations, trade unions, and scientific societies in the 
field of mental health were unified in a common organization, called the 
Psychiatry Alliance, and this alliance agreed on common action points and acted 
together to influence politicians. An assertive approach toward politicians and 
media was pivotal, and being a first mover and presenting tentative budgets was 
very influential.

OBJECTIVES: Discussions on the political scene in the United States have been 
accompanied by the notion that the country has morphed into a gerontocracy, a 
system of governance where power is wielded predominantly by older individuals. 
With rising life expectancy, more as well as older candidates are likely to run 
for and stay in office. This study analyzes perceptions regarding the older 
political leadership of the United States.
METHODS: We collected 3,599 tweets containing the word "gerontocracy" which were 
uploaded between September 10, 2022 and November 10, 2022, a month prior to the 
midterm elections in the United States, when this topic was likely to have 
sparked considerable discussion. After applying our exclusion criteria, 1,266 
tweets were retained. Our qualitative content analysis was performed inductively 
and deductively.
RESULTS: Seven themes emerged. Most tweets (24%; N = 304) highlighted that 
"Gerontocracy is a Problem" (Theme 1). Theme 2 (21%) focused on how "Democracy 
is a Sham" (N = 270). Theme 3 (19%) positioned "Old Age as the Problem and Youth 
as the Solution" (N = 234). Theme 4 (11%) was about how "The Future is at Stake" 
(N = 145). "Health Concerns" dominated Theme 5 (10%; N = 126). Theme 6 looked at 
"Structural Reforms" (9%, N = 115). Theme 7 "In Defense of the Gerontocracy" 
formed 6% of the data set (N = 72).
DISCUSSION: Attitudes toward older politicians are commonly tied to negative 
stereotypes surrounding old age. As the population ages, it is paramount that 
society focuses on potentially more important considerations in the evaluation 
of the actual caliber of a politician.

Developmental diet alters the fecundity-longevity relationship and age-related 
gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster.

The standard evolutionary theory of aging predicts a negative relationship 
(trade-off) between fecundity and longevity. However, in principle, the 
fecundity-longevity relationship can become positive in populations in which 
individuals have unequal resources. Positive fecundity-longevity relationships 
also occur in queens of eusocial insects such as ants and bees. Developmental 
diet is likely to be central to determining trade-offs as it affects key fitness 
traits, but its exact role remains uncertain. For example, in Drosophila 
melanogaster, changes in adult diet can affect fecundity, longevity, and gene 
expression throughout life, but it is unknown how changes in developmental 
(larval) diet affect fecundity-longevity relationships and gene expression in 
adults. Using D. melanogaster, we tested the hypothesis that varying 
developmental diet alters the directionality of fecundity-longevity 
relationships in adults, and characterised associated gene expression changes. 
We reared larvae on low (20%), medium (100%), and high (120%) yeast diets, and 
transferred adult females to a common diet. We measured fecundity and longevity 
of individual adult females and profiled gene expression changes with age. Adult 
females raised on different larval diets exhibited fecundity-longevity 
relationships that varied from significantly positive to significantly negative, 
despite minimal differences in mean life-time fertility or longevity. Treatments 
also differed in age-related gene expression, including for aging-related genes. 
Hence the sign of fecundity-longevity relationships in adult insects can be 
altered and even reversed by changes in larval diet quality. By extension, 
larval diet differences may represent a key mechanistic factor underpinning 
positive fecundity-longevity relationships observed in species such as eusocial 
insects.

OBJECTIVES: To support clinical decision-making in children with aortic valve 
disease, by compiling the available evidence on outcome after paediatric aortic 
valve repair (AVr).
METHODS: A systematic review of literature reporting clinical outcome after 
paediatric AVr (mean age at surgery <18 years) published between 1 January 1990 
and 23 December 2021 was conducted. Early event risks, late event rates and 
time-to-event data were pooled. A microsimulation model was employed to simulate 
the lives of individual children, infants and neonates following AVr.
RESULTS: Forty-one publications were included, encompassing 2 623 patients with 
17 217 patient-years of follow-up (median follow-up: 7.3 years; range: 1.0-14.4 
years). Pooled mean age during repair for aortic stenosis in children (<18 
years), infants (<1 year) or neonates (<30 days) was 5.2 ± 3.9 years, 
35 ± 137 days and 11 ± 6 days, respectively. Pooled early mortality after 
stenosis repair in children, infants and neonates, respectively, was 3.5% (95% 
confidence interval: 1.9-6.5%), 7.4% (4.2-13.0%) and 10.7% (6.8-16.9%). Pooled 
late reintervention rate after stenosis repair in children, infants and 
neonates, respectively, was 3.31%/year (1.66-6.63%/year), 6.84%/year 
(3.95-11.83%/year) and 6.32%/year (3.04-13.15%/year); endocarditis 0.07%/year 
(0.03-0.21%/year), 0.23%/year (0.07-0.71%/year) and 0.49%/year 
(0.18-1.29%/year); and valve thrombosis 0.05%/year (0.01-0.26%/year), 0.15%/year 
(0.04-0.53%/year) and 0.19%/year (0.05-0.77%/year). Microsimulation-based mean 
life expectancy in the first 20 years for children, infants and neonates with 
aortic stenosis, respectively, was 18.4 years (95% credible interval: 18.1-18.7 
years; relative survival compared to the matched general population: 92.2%), 
16.8 years (16.5-17.0 years; relative survival: 84.2%) and 15.9 years (14.8-17.0 
years; relative survival: 80.1%). Microsimulation-based 20-year risk of 
reintervention in children, infants and neonates, respectively, was 75.2% 
(72.9-77.2%), 53.8% (51.9-55.7%) and 50.8% (47.0-57.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcomes after paediatric AVr for stenosis are 
satisfactory and dependent on age at surgery. Despite a high hazard of 
reintervention for valve dysfunction and slightly impaired survival relative to 
the general population, AVr is associated with low valve-related event 
occurrences and should be considered in children with aortic valve disease.

Tetrastichus howardi (Olliff) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) parasitizes the diamond 
back moth Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), but not much is 
known about its potential as a biocontrol agent. A rearing protocol has been 
established for this parasitoid on pupae of the factitious host Tenebrio molitor 
(L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), with the aim of releasing it in the field to 
manage several lepidopteran species. The potential population growth of a 
parasitoid can be measured through fertility life tables and provide supporting 
information for using T. howardi in the management of P. xylostella. Also, the 
fitness and behavior of T. howardi reared on a factitious host can be indicators 
of its potential to control P. xylostella. Thus, in this study, the fertility 
life table parameters of T. howardi parasitizing P. xylostella were determined, 
as well as the effects of the natal host on the behavior of T. howardi towards 
host volatiles and parasitism rate. The results showed that net reproduction 
rate (Ro) and the intrinsic rate of population growth (rm) of T. howardi 
parasitizing P. xylostella were 13.6 (♀/♀) and 0.124 (♀/♀*day), respectively, 
whereas the mean generation time was 20.9 days. Moreover, the natal host (T. 
molitor or P. xylostella) did not affect the fitness, parasitism rate, or 
olfactory response of T. howardi. In general, regardless of the natal host, 
parasitoid females responded to volatiles of both host species and exhibited the 
same rate of parasitism on P. xylostella. Therefore, T. howardi reared on the 
factitious host maintains its attraction and potential to parasitize P. 
xylostella, and can contribute to the biological control of this pest.

A mitotoxic fungicide alters post-ingestive glucose signals necessary for 
associative learning in honey bees.

The Proboscis Extension Reflex (PER) paradigm trains honey bees to associate an 
odor with a sugar reward and is commonly used to assess impacts on associative 
learning after exposure to pesticides. While the effects of some types of 
pesticides have been well-investigated, relatively little attention has been 
focused on fungicides that are applied to flowering crops. We have previously 
shown that consumption of field-relevant concentrations of the fungicide 
Pristine® (active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) impairs 
honey bee performance in an associative learning assay, but the mechanism of its 
action has not been investigated. We hypothesized that Pristine® interferes with 
carbohydrate absorption and/or regulation, thereby disrupting the post-ingestive 
feedback mechanisms necessary for robust learning. To test this hypothesis, we 
measured hemolymph glucose and trehalose levels at five time points during the 
ten minutes after bees consumed a sucrose solution. Pristine®-exposed bees had 
elevated baseline glucose concentrations in the hemolymph relative to control 
bees. Hemolymph glucose levels rose significantly within five minutes of feeding 
in control bees, but not in Pristine®-fed bees. These data suggest that the 
post-ingestive feedback mechanisms necessary for robust learning are disrupted 
in bees that have consumed this fungicide, providing a plausible mechanistic 
explanation for its effects on learning performance in the PER assay. 
Pristine®-exposed bees may have elevated hemolymph glucose levels because the 
fungicide elicits an inflammatory response. These results provide additional 
mechanistic understanding of the negative physiological effects of mitotoxic 
fungicides on this important pollinator.

BACKGROUND: Despite significant progress in the development of T cell-engaging 
therapies for various B-cell malignancies, a high medical need remains for the 
refractory disease setting, often characterized by suboptimal target levels.
METHODS: To address this issue, we have developed a 65-kDa multispecific 
antibody construct, CLN-978, with affinities tuned to optimize the killing of 
low-CD19 expressing tumor cells. CLN-978 bound to CD19 on B cells with picomolar 
affinity, and to CD3ε on T cells with nanomolar affinity. A serum albumin 
binding domain was incorporated to extend serum half-life. In this setting, we 
biophysically characterize and report the activities of CLN-978 in cell 
co-culture assays, multiple mouse models and non-human primates.
RESULTS: Human T cells redirected by CLN-978 could eliminate target cells 
expressing less than 300 copies of CD19 on their surface. The half-life 
extension and high affinity for CD19 led to significant antitumor activity in 
murine lymphoma models at very low doses of CLN-978. In primates, we observed a 
long serum half-life, deep and sustained depletion of normal B cells, and 
remarkable tolerability, in particular, reduced cytokine release when CLN-978 
was administered subcutaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: CLN-978 warrants further exploration. An ongoing clinical phase 1 
trial is investigating safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the 
initial therapeutic potential of subcutaneously administered CLN-978 in patients 
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

To quantify the societal impact of disability in patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), this study estimated the disability-free life expectancy 
(DFLE), loss-of-DFLE and explored their associations with quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) and loss-of-QALE. We interlinked national databases and 
applied a rolling-over algorithm to estimate the lifetime survival function for 
patients with NSCLC. Using the EuroQOL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) and Barthel index 
(BI), we repeatedly measured the quality-of-life and disability functions of 
NSCLC patients who visited our hospital from 2011 to 2020. Age-, sex-matched 
referents were simulated from lifetables of the same calendar year of diagnosis. 
We categorized BI scores ≤ 70 as in need of long-term care and constructed 
linear mixed models to estimate the utility values and disability scores. We 
collected 960 cases and 3088 measurements. The proportions of measurements 
without disability at age 50-64 and in stage I-IIIa, 50-64 and stage IIIb-IV, 
65-89 and stage I-IIIa and 65-89 and stage IIIb-IV were 97.3%, 89.3%, 
94.8%,78.3%, corresponding to DFLEs of 15.3, 2.4, 6.8, 1.2 years and 
losses-of-DFLE of 8.1, 20.7, 4.0, 8.6 years, respectively, indicating that 
advanced stage had a stronger effect than old age. Survivors in advanced stages 
showed increased demands for assistance in almost all subitems. The DFLEs seemed 
to be approximate to the QALEs and the latter were shorter than the former due 
to discomfort and depression. From a societal perspective, future health 
technology assessment should consider the impact of lifetime duration of 
functional disability. Early diagnosis of NSCLC may decrease the burden of 
long-term care.

Chemotherapy is an effortless and frequently used approach in cancer therapy. 
However, in most cases, it can only prolong life expectancy and does not 
guarantee a complete cure. Furthermore, chemotherapy is associated with severe 
adverse effects, one of the major complications of effective cancer therapy. In 
addition, newly published research outputs show that cancer stem cells are 
involved in cancer disease progression, drug resistance, metastasis, and 
recurrence and that they are functional in the trans-differentiation capacity of 
cancer stem cells to cancer cells in response to treatments. Novel strategies 
are therefore required for better management of cancer therapy. The prime 
approach would be to synthesize and develop novel drugs that need extensive 
resources, time, and endurance to be brought into therapeutic use. The 
subsequent approach would be to screen the anti-cancer activity of available 
non-cancerous drugs. This concept of repurposing non-cancer drugs as an 
alternative to current cancer therapy has become popular in recent years because 
using existing anticancer drugs has several adverse effects. Micronutrients have 
also been investigated for cancer therapy due to their significant anti-cancer 
effects with negligible or no side effects and availability in food sources. In 
this paper, we discuss an ideal hypothesis for screening available non-cancerous 
drugs with anticancer activity, with a focus on cancer stem cells and their 
clinical application for cancer treatment. Further, drug repurposing and the 
combination of micronutrients that can target both cancers and cancer stem cells 
may result in a better therapeutic approach leading to maximum tumor growth 
control.

Education plays a crucial role in shaping the health outcomes of adults. This 
study examines the relationship between educational attainment and health across 
Europe. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe 
(SHARE), we estimate educational inequalities in disability-free life expectancy 
(DFLE) by gender in seven Western European (2004-2019) and three Central and 
Eastern European (CEE) (2010-2019) countries. We exploit a novel approach that 
combines the Sullivan method and multivariate life tables to calculate DFLE 
using SHARE data. We find that educational differences in DFLE favoring the 
better-educated exist in both CEE and Western European countries, but also that 
the differences across countries are more pronounced among the low-educated. 
While the absolute gaps in DFLE between low- and high-educated individuals in 
CEE and Western European countries are similar, the educational disparities in 
DFLE impose a more significant burden on the CEE populations due to their 
overall lower life expectancy. Educational inequalities are larger among women 
than among men in CEE countries, while the results for Western European 
countries are mixed. Our findings further highlight the important role of the 
institutional context in mitigating or exacerbating educational inequalities in 
health.

Few studies have evaluated environmental factors that predict survival to old 
age. Our study included 913 African American participants in the Jackson Heart 
Study (JHS) who resided in the tri-county area of the Jackson, MS metropolitan 
area and were 65-80 years at baseline. Participants were followed from 2000 
through 2019 for the outcome of survival to 85 years old. We evaluated each of 
the following census tract-level measures of the social/physical environment as 
exposures: socioeconomic status, cohesion, violence, disorder, healthy food 
stores, residential land use, and walkability. We assessed mediation by physical 
activity and chronic conditions. As a complementary ecologic analysis, we used 
census-tract data to examine factors associated with a greater life expectancy. 
A total of 501 (55%) JHS participants survived to age 85 years or older. Higher 
social cohesion and greater residential land use were modestly associated with 
survival to old age (risk difference = 25%, 95% CI: 0-49%; and 4%, 95% CI: 1-7%, 
respectively). These neighborhood effects were modestly mediated through leisure 
time physical activity; additionally, social cohesion was mediated through home 
and yard activity. In our ecologic analysis, a greater percentage of homeowners 
and a greater proportion of people living in partnered families were associated 
with higher census-tract level life expectancy. African American older adults 
living in residential neighborhoods or neighborhoods with high social cohesion 
were more likely to survive to old age.

OBJECTIVES: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represents the standard 
treatment for ST-elevated myocardial infarction, nevertheless, mortality and 
heart failures are frequent. Pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus 
occlusion (PiCSO) might reduce infarct size showing better patients' outcomes. 
We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PCI+PiCSO compared to PCI from the 
National Healthcare Service (NHS) perspective in Italy.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate life years (LYs), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. A micro-costing analysis has been 
performed to inform the cost of PCI+PiCSO procedure. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to test the robustness of the model results.
RESULTS: Considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000€/QALY for the ICUR 
and a cost for PCI+PiCSO procedure of 14,654€, the innovative strategy may be 
cost-effective compared to PCI alone from the Italian NHS perspective, showing 
an ICUR of 17,530€/QALY (ICER 14,631€/LY) over a lifetime horizon; the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that PCI+PiCSO is cost-effective in 
78.8% of simulations.Considering the above mentioned willingness-to-pay 
threshold, PCI+PiCSO strategy would be cost-effective over a lifetime horizon 
considering a cost for PCI+PiCSO procedure lower than 28,160€.
CONCLUSION: PCI+PiCSO procedure may be considered a cost-effective technology 
that allows reducing cardiac events, while improving patients' life expectancy 
and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Large extracellular vesicles (lEV) enriched for endothelial and 
blood cell markers are increased in metabolic conditions such as obesity or type 
2 diabetes (T2D), actively contribute to the atherosclerosis process, and have 
been identified as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Although bariatric surgery (BS) in individuals with obesity is 
related to decreased cardiovascular (CV) risk and increased life expectancy, 
post-BS these subjects are still at higher CV risk compared to the general 
population. We aimed to compare the lEV profiles between individuals with 
obesity, with or without T2D, before and 1-year after BS, and normal-weight 
controls.
METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study with individuals eligible for BS, with 
or without T2D (T2D and OB groups, respectively) and healthy controls (HC-group) 
matched by age and sex. The concentration and phenotype of lEV were assessed by 
flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 108 individuals (age 48.0 ± 10.5 years; 84.3% 
females). Before BS, the OB-group presented higher concentrations of lEV 
enriched for endothelial and blood cell biomarkers than the HC, but lower 
concentrations than those observed in the T2D-group (p < 0.05). BS resulted in a 
significant reduction in most of the lEV enriched for cell-specific markers in 
both subgroups. lEV differences between OB and T2D groups were no longer 
observed post-BS (p > 0.05). However, compared with HC, OB and T2D groups still 
showed increased concentrations of lEV enriched for platelet and endothelial 
cell markers (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: At one year after BS, lEV concentrations remain above the 
physiological range. These abnormalities might contribute to explaining the 
increased CV risk after BS and underscore the importance of long-term CV risk 
factor control in post-BS individuals.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as heart disease and stroke, have a 
significant impact on life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, and medical 
costs in Japan. Each prefecture is currently promoting measures in accordance 
with the Japanese National Plan for Promotion of Measures Against 
Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Disease, which was established by the 
government. In recent years, the crude mortality rate of heart disease in Japan 
has been increasing year by year with the aging population. Meanwhile, the 
age-adjusted mortality rate has leveled off or shown a downward trend. In 
addition, the proportion of acute myocardial infarction has decreased, whereas 
the proportion of heart failure has increased. By contrast, both the crude and 
age-adjusted mortality rates of stroke have a declining trend. Nevertheless, 
considering the potential variations in death certificates issued for patients 
with myocardial infarction across different prefectures, it is crucial to 
determine the incidence of CVD in each prefecture for the accurate assessment of 
CVD trends. However, as for the incidence of CVD, not many prefectures have yet 
implemented registration programs. The age-adjusted incidence rate of acute 
myocardial infarction has been increasing in some areas and decreasing in others 
since 1990. The age-adjusted incidence rate of stroke has consistently declined 
since the 1960s. Nevertheless, the possible increase in the incidence rate of 
cerebral embolism and thrombotic cerebral infarction among patients with 
different stroke subtypes is a cause of concern. The impact of heart failure on 
the incidence of heart disease has increased. Therefore, relevant academic 
societies and prefectures must collaborate in registering the incidence of heart 
failure as well as myocardial infarction and implementing countermeasures.

BACKGROUND: Asbestosis is a common pneumoconiosis caused by long-term asbestos 
exposure. Analysis of the burden of asbestosis would help in creating informed 
public health strategies.
METHODS: Data on asbestosis were analyzed using the Global Burden of Disease 
study 2019. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to 
demonstrate temporal trends in the age-standardized rate (ASR) of asbestosis 
from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Globally, 36,339 incident cases of asbestosis, led to 3572 deaths and 
71,225 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019. During 1990-2019, the 
overall ASRs of incidence and DALYs declined by an annual average of 0.29 % and 
0.27 %, with the respective EAPCs being -0.29 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 
-0.43, -0.14) and -0.27 (95%CI: -0.53, -0.01). The ASRs of mortality increased 
with EAPC of 0.65 (95%CI: 0.34, 0.96). Trends in incidence and prevalence rose 
in females, but declined in males. The asbestosis burden was heterogeneous 
across regions and countries. The heaviest burden of asbestosis was observed in 
the United States, India, and China. Trends in ASRs of asbestosis varied across 
countries/territories. Pronounced increasing trends in incidence and prevalence 
occurred in Georgia, Iran, and Croatia.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing incident trend of asbestosis was observed globally over 
the past three decades. However, the ongoing asbestosis burden highlighted that 
asbestosis remained a challenge to public health, and cost-effective measures 
were required to reduce the asbestosis burden.

Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in the blood and has 
desirable properties as a drug carrier. One of the most promising ways to 
exploit HSA as a carrier is to append an albumin-binding moiety (ABM) to a drug 
for in situ HSA binding upon administration. Nature- and library-derived ABMs 
vary in size, affinity, and epitope, differentially improving the 
pharmacokinetics of an appended drug. In this review, we evaluate the current 
state of knowledge regarding various aspects of ABMs and the unique advantages 
of ABM-mediated drug delivery. Furthermore, we discuss how ABMs can be 
specifically modulated to maximize potential benefits in clinical development.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common neurological disorders 
in children and results in lifelong physical impairments. Adults with CP have 
approximately the same life expectancy as their non-disabled peers, so helping 
them to stay healthy throughout the life course will have long-term cost 
benefits via reductions in hospital admissions, long term care and unemployment 
rates.
AIM: This paper reports on a national online survey that explores how adults 
with CP experience ageing.
DESIGN & SETTING: Online survey given to adults with CP in the UK.
METHOD: The participants were adults with CP. Items for the online survey were 
taken from existing self-report measures, with additional items developed for 
the survey. Several domains of functioning were assessed including mobility, 
dexterity, fatigue, pain, speech, mental health, swallowing and health 
maintenance/self-care as well as healthcare usage. Data were analysed using 
chi-square to examine the relationships between the demographic variables and 
the survey responses.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 395 participants, of which 72.2% were 
female and approximately 60% under the age of 45. Respondents reported having 
problems with mobility, pain and fatigue with older participants reporting 
higher levels of pain and more mobility problems, although the correlations were 
fairly small. Healthcare usage was surprisingly low.
CONCLUSION: We found that age was associated with a decline in mobility and a 
higher level of pain, although the relationships were weak. It is possible that 
the low healthcare usage among our respondents is due to services not being 
available to respond to their needs.

INTRODUCTION: The population in Portugal is ageing due to increased life 
expectancy and reduced fertility rates. We aimed to estimate the health 
trajectories of Portuguese older adults (60 + years old) in a 10-year period and 
to assess associated sociodemographic, lifestyle factors and multimorbidity 
status.
METHODS: Using the population-based EpiDoC cohort, we estimated the trajectories 
of health-related quality of life and physical function of 4135 Portuguese older 
adults over 10 years using linear mixed models. Factors associated to 
health-related quality of life and physical function were assessed using linear 
mixed models and random intercept tobit regression, respectively.
RESULTS: The physical disability of participants increased by 0.263 (0.240, 
0.286), and health-related quality of life declined by 0.074 (-0.084, -0.063), 
over 10 years. With advancing age, older adults reported a faster reduction in 
health-related quality of life and faster increase in physical disability. In 
general, women were in worse health than men at baseline, albeit with a similar 
rate of change throughout the follow-up. Higher education and regular exercise 
were associated with better health-related quality of life and physical function 
while multimorbidity and excess weight were associated with worse reporting of 
these outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings, based on longitudinal data with 10 years of 
follow-up, are essential to effectively plan resource allocation, plan better 
healthcare and design informed public health policies in Portugal. This study 
characterizes ageing in Portugal showing increased physical disability and 
decreased health-related quality of life with advancing age older adults, 
helping to develop public health policies.

INTRODUCTION: In the last 2 decades medical androgen deprivation therapy has 
replaced surgical castration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. We 
assessed costs and patient satisfaction associated with epididymal sparing 
bilateral simple orchiectomy in an underinsured, immigrant population.
METHODS: We performed epididymal sparing bilateral simple orchiectomy in 
patients with metastatic prostate cancer between January 2003 and September 2014 
at our institution. Procedures were performed in the operating room with the 
patient under general anesthesia and later under conscious sedation. Associated 
material and facility costs were calculated and compared to costs of androgen 
deprivation therapy with leuprolide or degarelix. Medication costs were 
calculated using wholesale acquisition costs. Patient satisfaction and body 
image perception were evaluated using a survey questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 108 orchiectomies were performed in the operating room and 
12 in the outpatient unit. The total cost of bilateral simple orchiectomy in the 
operating room was $4,118. By performing orchiectomy in the outpatient unit we 
reduced the cost to $2,101. The cost of orchiectomy in the operating room is the 
equivalent of 4 months of leuprolide and 7.8 months of degarelix. When performed 
in the outpatient clinic the cost of bilateral simple orchiectomy is equivalent 
to 2.1 months of leuprolide and 4 months of degarelix. Overall 95% of 
participants surveyed were pleased with the surgical results.
CONCLUSIONS: The average life expectancy of men with metastatic prostate cancer 
is 30 months and, thus, a onetime surgical cost offers significant cost savings. 
Further cost reductions are achieved by performing bilateral simple orchiectomy 
in the outpatient setting. By sparing the epididymis, patients are left with a 
sense of testicular preservation. Epididymal sparing bilateral simple 
orchiectomy is a cost-effective and cosmetically acceptable method of androgen 
deprivation therapy for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION: The standardised mortality rate (SMR) for people with diabetes in 
England is 1.5-1.7, with differences in outcomes between sexes. There has been 
little work examining the factors that could have an impact on this or on what 
may determine sex differences in outcome.
METHODS: Data were extracted for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Salford
