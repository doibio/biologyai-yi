Dietary habits are associated with various diseases and assessed by dietary 
patterns (DPs). Since the ALDH2 genotype is correlated with alcohol and several 
food preferences, this genotype is probably associated with DPs. In this 
cross-sectional study of 1612 elderly adults, we investigated the effects of the 
ALDH2 genotype on DPs and the mediating role of alcohol intake. We identified 
the ALDH2 genotype and conducted a dietary history survey, then used principal 
component analysis to determine DPs for each gender. We performed multiple 
regression analysis to determine the independent contribution of the ALDH2 
genotype and alcohol intake to DP scores. We identified three DPs: the "Japanese 
side dish type" (DP1), the "Japanese dish with alcohol type" (DP2), and the 
"Western dish with alcohol type" (DP3). In men, the single nucleotide 
polymorphism ALDH2 rs671 was significantly associated with all DP scores. When 
alcohol intake was added as a covariate, ALDH2 rs671 was still significantly 
correlated with the DP2 score but not with the DP1 or DP3 score, and alcohol 
intake was significantly correlated with all DP scores. In women, ALDH2 rs671 
was significantly associated with the DP2 and DP3 scores; however, after adding 
alcohol intake as a covariate, these associations disappeared, and alcohol 
intake significantly correlated with all DP scores. In conclusion, the ALDH2 
genotype was associated with several DPs in elderly adults, but most 
associations were mediated by alcohol intake.

Targeted molecular radiation therapy is a promising emerging treatment modality 
in oncology, and peptide synthesis may shorten the time to reach the clinical 
stage. In this study, we have explored Chemo-Enzymatic Peptide Synthesis, or 
CEPS, as a new means of producing a therapeutic HER2 targeted Affibody® 
molecule, comprising a C-terminal albumin binding domain (ABD) for half-life 
extension and a total length of 108 amino acids. In addition, a DOTA moiety 
could be incorporated at N-terminus directly during the synthesis step and 
subsequently utilized for site-specific radiolabeling with the therapeutic 
radionuclide 177Lu. Retained thermodynamic stability as well as retained binding 
to both HER2 and albumin was verified. Furthermore, HER2 binding specificity of 
the radiolabeled Affibody molecule was confirmed by an in vitro saturation assay 
showing a significantly higher cell-bound activity of SKOV-3 (high HER2 
expression) compared with BxPC3 (low HER2 expression), both in the presence and 
absence of HSA. In vivo evaluation in mice bearing HER2 expressing xenografts 
also showed specific tumor targeting as well as extended time in circulation and 
reduced kidney uptake compared with a HER2 targeted Affibody molecule without 
the ABD moiety. To conclude, we have demonstrated that CEPS can be used for 
production of Affibody-fusion molecules with retained in vitro and in vivo 
functionality.

Polymers are extensively used in food and beverage packaging to shield against 
contaminants and external damage due to their barrier properties, protecting the 
goods inside and reducing waste. However, current trends in polymers for food, 
water, and beverage applications are moving forward into the design and 
preparation of advanced polymers, which can act as active packaging, bearing 
active ingredients in their formulation, or controlling the head-space 
composition to extend the shelf-life of the goods inside. In addition, polymers 
can serve as sensory polymers to detect and indicate the presence of target 
species, including contaminants of food quality indicators, or even to remove or 
separate target species for later quantification. Polymers are nowadays 
essential materials for both food safety and the extension of food shelf-life, 
which are key goals of the food industry, and the irruption of smart materials 
is opening new opportunities for going even further in these goals. This review 
describes the state of the art following the last 10 years of research within 
the field of food and beverage polymer's applications, covering present 
applications, perspectives, and concerns related to waste generation and the 
circular economy.

Challenges and constraints deter the effective gathering of adequate information 
specific to the characteristics of yam (Dioscorea rotundata) landraces capable 
of producing a promising instant pounded fufu product. This current work, 
therefore, investigated the effects of yam varieties on flour physicochemical 
characteristics and resultant instant fufu pasting and sensory attributes. The 
D. rotundata varieties, obtained from the International Institute of Tropical 
Agriculture (IITA) (yam-breeding programme) experimental 
plots, included commercially available Fekatsa (control), alongside ten (N = 10) 
improved (varieties) namely: TDr 08/00068, TDr 10/00912, TDr 89/02665, TDr 
95/01932, TDr 95/18544, TDr 97/00632, TDr 97/00917, TDr Agwekachi, TDr Ebute, 
and TDr Meccakusa). Compared to control, the improved 
yam varieties produced promising characteristic range values, for instance, 
amylose (15.77-33.89%), bulk density (0.77-0.86 g/cm3), setback (99.5-503.46 
RVU), peak time (4.93-7.00 min) along with peak temperature (83.99 °C). From the 
correlation coefficient and principal component analysis, it was possible to 
deduce how flour physicochemical characteristics were associated with the 
resultant instant fufu pasting and sensory attributes. Considering the totality 
of results of this current study, both TDr 10/00912, and TDr 
Meccakusa yam varieties demonstrate a high potential on instant pounded flour 
towards producing an acceptable quality and promising fufu product.

    Parasit Vectors. 2023 Jan 10;16(1):9.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi has become a major public health concern in 
Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, where it is now the only cause of indigenous malaria. 
The importance of P. knowlesi has spurred on a series of studies on this 
parasite, as well as on the biology and ecology of its principal vector, 
Anopheles balabacensis. However, there remain critical knowledge gaps on the 
biology of An. balabacensis, such as life history data and life table 
parameters. To fill these gaps, we conducted a life table study of An. 
balabacensis in the laboratory. Characterising vector life cycles and survival 
rates can inform more accurate estimations of the serial interval, the time 
between two linked cases, which is crucial to understanding and monitoring 
potentially changing transmission patterns.
METHODS: Individuals of An. balabacensis were collected in the field in Ranau 
district, Sabah to establish a laboratory colony. Induced mating was used, and 
the life history parameters of the progeny were recorded. The age-stage, two-sex 
life table approach was used in the analysis. The culture conditions in the 
laboratory were 9 h light:15 h dark, mean temperature 25.7 °C ± 0.05 and 
relative humidity 75.8% ± 0.31.
RESULTS: The eggs hatched within 2 days, and the larval stage lasted for 
10.5 days in total, with duration of instar stages I, II, III and IV of 2.3, 
3.7, 2.3, 2.2 days, respectively. The maximum total fecundity was 729 for one 
particular female, while the maximum female age-specific mean fecundity (mx) was 
142 at age 59 days. The gross reproductive rate or number of offspring per 
individual was about 102. On average, each female laid 1.81 ± 0.19 (range 1-7) 
batches of eggs, with 63% of the females producing only one batch; only one 
female laid six batches, while one other laid seven. Each batch comprised 
159 ± 17.1 eggs (range 5-224) and the female ratio of offspring was 0.28 ± 0.06. 
The intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase, net reproductive rate, 
mean generation time and doubling time were, respectively, 0.12 ± 0.01 day-1, 
1.12 ± 0.01 day-1, 46.2 ± 14.97, 33.02 ± 1.85 and 5.97 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the net reproductive rate and intrinsic rate of increase of 
An. balabacensis are lower than those of other species in published studies. Our 
results can be used to improve models of P. knowlesi transmission and to set a 
baseline for assessing the impacts of environmental change on malaria dynamics. 
Furthermore, incorporating these population parameters of An. balabacensis into 
spatial and temporal models on the transmission of P. knowlesi would provide 
better insight and increase the accuracy of epidemiological forecasting.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term retention, reasons for discontinuation, 
efficacy, tolerability, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during 
adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV) treatment in adults with focal seizures by number 
of lifetime antiseizure medications (ASMs).
METHODS: Post hoc analyses of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial (N01358; NCT01261325) and corresponding open-label extension (OLE) 
(N01379; NCT01339559) of adjunctive BRV in adults (16-80 years of age) with 
focal seizures. Outcomes were assessed from the first day of BRV treatment in 
the double-blind (patients randomized to BRV) or open-label trial (patients 
randomized to placebo) by number of lifetime ASMs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, or ≥ 7). 
Lifetime ASMs were defined as previous (stopped before BRV initiation) and 
concomitant ASMs at BRV initiation.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty patients received adjunctive BRV (safety set 
[SS]; median modal dose: 200 mg/day [N = 737]; median treatment duration: 
2.67 years), of whom 13.8 % had 1-2, 20.8 % had 3-4, 21.1 % had 5-6 and 44.3 % 
had ≥7 lifetime ASMs. Patients with a higher number of lifetime ASMs had a 
younger age at epilepsy onset, longer epilepsy duration, and higher baseline 
seizure frequency. Kaplan-Meier estimated retention on BRV at 12 (83.2-65.9 %) 
and 36 months (63.0-44.1 %) was highest in patients with 1-2 lifetime ASMs and 
decreased with the number of lifetime ASMs. The estimated proportions of 
patients who discontinued BRV due to lack of efficacy or treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) increased with the number of lifetime ASMs. Efficacy 
analyses included seven hundred and thirty eight patients (intention-to-treat 
set [ITT]). Median percentage reductions from baseline in focal seizure 
frequency/28 days (76.3-39.6 %), 50 % responder rates (66.7-39.8 %), 75 % 
responder rates (51.0-19.6 %), and continuous seizure freedom for ≥12 months at 
any time during BRV treatment (35.3-6.1 %) were highest in patients with 1-2 
lifetime ASMs and decreased by the number of lifetime ASMs. The overall 
incidence of TEAEs (SS) was generally similar in each lifetime ASM subgroup 
(84.4-90.5 %). Discontinuations due to TEAEs increased with the number of 
lifetime ASMs (7.8-20.1 %). The greatest improvements in QOLIE-31-P scores 
occurred in the Seizure Worry and Daily Activities/Social Function subscales, 
with no clear pattern by the number of lifetime ASMs at 12 months and with the 
highest improvement in patients with 1-2 lifetime ASMs at 24 months. At 
24 months, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Anxiety subscale 
scores improved in patients (SS) with 1-2 and 3-4 lifetime ASMs. HADS Depression 
subscale scores were generally stable independent of the number of lifetime 
ASMs.
CONCLUSIONS: The balance between efficacy, tolerability, and HRQOL was most 
favorable in patients with focal seizures who had been exposed to one or two 
ASMs before BRV initiation. However, patients exposed to ≥7 ASMs before BRV 
initiation also benefitted from long-term adjunctive BRV treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Deprescribing is associated with positive health outcomes for 
older adults in long-term care (LTC), however deprescribing is not universally 
implemented.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of 
potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) prescribed to frail older adults in 
Irish long-term care facilities (LTCFs), as identified by the Screening Tool of 
Older Persons Prescriptions in Frail adults with limited life expectancy, 
version 2 (STOPPFrail v2).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted in two publicly funded LTCFs 
in Ireland. Eligible participants were those (1) ≥ 65 years of age; (2) resident 
in a LTCF; (3) eligible as per the STOPPFrail v2 criteria by the site's Medical 
Officer; and (4) receiving regular medication. Data collected included age, sex, 
drug, dose, frequency, regular/pro re nata prescribing and indication/relevant 
diagnoses. Rates of polypharmacy (taking five or more medications) and excessive 
polypharmacy (taking 10 or more medications) were calculated. STOPPFrail v2 was 
used to identify PIMs; however, clinical measurements were not taken. 
Descriptive and association statistics were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the 103 residents, 89 were ≥ 65 years of age and categorised as 
frail and were therefore eligible for inclusion in the study. Of those eligible, 
85 (95.5%) had polypharmacy and 57 (64%) experienced excessive polypharmacy. The 
mean number of regular medications was 10.8 (± 3.8), total medications 17.7 
(± 5) and diagnoses 5.5 (± 2.5). The mean number of PIMs per resident was 4.8 
(± 2.6). Of the eligible participants, 59.6% had at least one medicine without a 
documented indication, while 61.8%, 42.7% and 30.3% had at least one PIM from 
the vitamin D, antihypertensives and proton pump inhibitors drug classes, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Medication and PIM use was high among LTC residents, with 
inappropriate polypharmacy of concern. Lack of clear indication for prescribing 
medications appears to be an issue in LTC, potentially affecting healthcare 
professionals' engagement with deprescribing. The prevalence of PIMs may be 
overestimated in the antihypertensives/antidiabetic classes due to the lack of 
clinical measurements.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to validate the cachexia staging score 
(CSS), a multidimensional, item-based diagnostic method of cachexia severity, 
for patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative care.
METHODS: Eligible patients were those with cancer who received palliative care 
during hospitalization between May 2019 and April 2020. All data were collected 
retrospectively from medical records. Cachexia was graded into four levels 
according to the CSS. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed with or without death 
as the outcome, comparing prognoses among different levels of cachexia with 
Bonferroni correction. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was 
performed to identify factors affecting mortality.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 196 patients was 65.8 ± 14 y. Men made up 42% of 
the study population. Lower body mass index, increased rate of weight loss, 
increased strength, assistance walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, 
and falls (SARC-F) points, decline in activities of daily living, appetite loss, 
and abnormal blood biomarkers were significantly more common with increasing 
severity of cachexia, and survival was shorter (P < 0.001). The hazard ratio 
(HR) increased with worsening severity of cachexia according to CSS 
classification (precachexia: HR, 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-12.46, 
P = 0.182; cachexia: HR, 4.77; 95% CI, 1.09-20.80; P = 0.038; and refractory 
cachexia: HR, 11.00; 95% CI, 2.37-51.07; P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The CSS predicted life expectancy in a population of patients 
receiving palliative care and had excellent prognostic discriminative power to 
classify patients at different stages of cachexia.

OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes of patients who underwent simultaneous 
radical cystectomy (RC) and radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for panurothelial 
carcinoma (PanUC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 67 patients who underwent 
simultaneous RC and unilateral RNU for PanUC, from 1996 to 2017. Kaplan-Meier 
estimates for remnant urothelium recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free 
survival, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were 
performed. Cox multivariate models were constructed.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 38 months, 29.8% of patients had a recurrence, 
34.3% had metastasis, 67.2% of patients died from any cause, and 37.3% died from 
urothelial carcinoma. Overall survival and CSS rates at 5 years were 44% and 
61%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, progression to muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer before surgery, presence of muscle-invasive stages at RC and/or 
RNU, and prostatic urethra involvement were predictors for worse metastasis-free 
survival and CSS. Forty-one patients (61.2%) had an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min before surgery and the number rose to 56 
(83.5%) after surgery; 29.8% patients needed renal function replacement therapy 
after surgery (16 haemodialysis and 4 renal transplant).
CONCLUSION: Patients with PanUC who undergo simultaneous surgery have adverse 
oncological (only 4 out of every 10 remain alive at 5 years) and functional 
outcomes (1 out of 3 will need renal function replacement therapy after 
surgery). Up to a third of the patients had a recurrence (urethra or 
contralateral kidney) within 18 months, justifying close surveillance or 
considering prophylactic urethrectomy. These data should help in counsel on 
morbidity and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent with 
population ageing. We sought to define the current prevalence of valvular heart 
disease in Australia.
METHODS: The TasELF and VicELF studies prospectively recruited 962 asymptomatic 
participants ≥65 years, with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, from the 
Tasmanian and Victorian communities. People were excluded if they had a previous 
diagnosis of heart failure, or a life expectancy <1 year. All underwent baseline 
echocardiography. Those with moderate or severe valvular disease were 
identified. The current prevalence of clinically significant valve disease was 
applied to the Australian Bureau of Statistics population projections.
RESULTS: Echocardiograms were interpretable in 943 participants (98%). 
Clinically significant valve disease was present in 5% of the population, and 
mitral regurgitation was the most common overall valvular lesion, present in 36% 
of the population. The projected numbers of people with clinically significant 
valvular disease is expected to increase significantly across all age groups by 
the year 2060.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant yet asymptomatic valvular disease was 
prevalent in a large community cohort of participants with at least one risk 
factor. The total burden of valvular heart disease is expected to increase 
dramatically over the coming decades.

OBJECTIVES: The drug overdose crisis with shifting patterns from primarily 
opioid to polysubstance uses and COVID-19 infections are 2 concurrent public 
health crises in the United States, affecting the population of sizes in 
different magnitudes (approximately < 10 million for substance use disorder 
[SUD] and drug overdoses vs 80 million for COVID-19 within 2 years of the 
pandemic). Our objective is to compare the relative scale of disease burden for 
the 2 crises within a common framework, which could help inform policy makers 
with resource allocation and prioritization strategies.
METHODS: We calculated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for SUD (including 
opioids and stimulants) and COVID-19 infections, respectively. We collected 
estimates for SUD prevalence, overdose deaths, COVID-19 cases and deaths, 
disability weights, and life expectancy from multiple publicly available 
sources. We then compared age distributions of estimated DALYs.
RESULTS: We estimated a total burden of 13.83 million DALYs for SUD and drug 
overdoses and 15.03 million DALYs for COVID-19 in 2 years since March 2020. 
COVID-19 burden was dominated by the fatal burden (> 95% of total DALYs), 
whereas SUD burden was attributed to both fatal (53%) and nonfatal burdens 
(47%). The highest disease burden was among individuals aged 30 to 39 years for 
SUD (27%) and 50 to 64 years for COVID-19 (31%).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the smaller size of the affected population, SUD and drug 
overdoses resulted in comparable disease burden with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Additional resources supporting evidence-based interventions in prevention and 
treatment may be warranted to ameliorate SUD and drug overdoses during both the 
pandemic and postpandemic recovery.

Diet is one of the most important factors affecting healthy life expectancy 
through the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as well as various 
chronic diseases. Because dietary habits and disease structure differ depending 
on the country, region, and/or race, evidence from each population is required. 
NIPPON DATA80/90 is a long-term cohort study of a representative Japanese 
population that participated in national nutrition surveys. Among the many 
findings of this cohort study, a dietary pattern with higher intake of fruits, 
vegetables, fish (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids), and dietary fiber and lower 
intake of salt as well as sodium-to-potassium ratio was found to be associated 
with a lower risk of CVD mortality. The results from our cohort study would be 
useful for effectively preventing CVD. This article reviews the published 
studies from the NIPPON DATA80/90 to highlight the significant findings that may 
be used to develop risk prevention strategies for CVD.

Nutrition, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition.

Japan is one of the countries with the highest life expectancy in the world, and 
maintaining good health is the key component to extend healthy life expectancy. 
According to World Health Organization, self-care is the ability to promote 
health, prevent disease, and maintain health. Food labels play an important role 
in healthy dietary habits for self-care. Food labels comprise nutrition claims 
and health claims. In Japan, the nutrition component exhibits the contents of 
energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and salt equivalent, which are mandatory, 
and saturated fat and dietary fiber, which are recommended. On the other hand, 
the health portion exhibits health maintenance and health promotion by 
nutrients/ingredients in foods. Under the Food Labeling Act, foods allowed to 
display health claims, are specified as "Foods with Health Claims" in Japan. The 
Consumer Affairs Agency reported that most consumers could not utilize food 
labels, even though the nutrition label serves as a parameter for a healthier 
food choice. In this regard, front-of-pack labels (FOPLs), are a beneficial tool 
which encourages people to choose healthier foods, and conduct self-care. 
However, FOPLs is still unfamiliar in Japan, so we have to investigate which 
nutrients and which type of FOPLs are the best for Japanese people. In addition 
to FOPL promotion, education is important to get consumers using food labels for 
extending their healthy life expectancy.

Nutrition for Older Adults.

Otsuka R(1).

The world population is aging rapidly. Japan has the oldest population in the 
world, with 28% of the current population aged 65 y or older. Maintaining good 
nutrition is important for preventing age-related deterioration in health. 
Physical activity levels, energy intake, and weight tend to decrease with age. 
Decreased food intake increases the risk of undernutrition due to the inadequate 
intake of essential nutrients. The proportion of the older population that is 
malnourished ranges from 1% to 5% among independent older adults living in the 
community, and increases to 30% to 50% among residents of care institutions. 
Among older adults, the risk of death increases with increasing leanness. In 
Japan, the government pays considerable attention to the prevention of adverse 
health effects related to obesity among young and middle-aged adults, although 
the adverse health effects related to undernutrition and being underweight among 
older adults have been overlooked. In addition to providing nutrients, eating 
has important psychological and social benefits. Therefore, there is a need to 
pay attention to the diet and nutritional needs of older adults in Japan in 
order to promote and maintain their physical and mental health.

Nutritional Management of Sarcopenia and Frailty-Shift from Metabolic Syndrome 
to Frailty.

Kuzuya M(1)(2).

Older adults have physical and metabolic characteristics, and there are many 
differences in nutritional outcomes from middle-aged adults. In addition, there 
are many factors that cause malnutrition peculiar to the older adults, which are 
not seen in middle-aged adults, and it is easy for them to lose weight and 
become malnourished. Therefore, nutritional management needs to take into 
account the age of each subject. Uniform nutritional management can even cause 
poor health outcomes. The concept of frailty, especially phenotype frailty, and 
sarcopenia, which have been advocated with the aging of the population and the 
extension of life expectancy around the world, is very important in considering 
the extension of healthy life expectancy. In other words, in the super-aged 
society, frailty and sarcopenia have been emphasized as factors of functional 
decline, physical dysfunction, and the need for long-term care in addition to 
the well-known diseases such as cardiovascular disease, malignant tumors, and 
infectious disease. In fact, these two conditions are strongly associated with 
the increased risk of new disease development, falls, fractures, disability, 
hospitalization and death in the older adults. These two conditions are 
primarily associated with malnutrition and decreased dietary protein intake, and 
may recover to robustness again with appropriate interventions such as 
nutritional therapy. Therefore, undernutrition measures are more important for 
prevention of frailty and sarcopenia than measures for obesity against metabolic 
syndrome in the older adults, especially in the late-stage older people.

Emergence of Novel Functions of Vitamins for the Prevention of Life-Style 
Related Diseases.

University.

Vitamins are a family of micronutrients comprising 13 groups of organic 
compounds, of which vitamin B1 was identified first, approximately 110 y ago. 
Deficiency of each vitamin results in specific symptoms, such as neuropathy, 
dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, pernicious anemia, scurvy, blindness, rickets, 
and bleeding. Almost all vitamins can modulate the functions of enzymes and/or 
other proteins involved in the formation of bone and soft tissues, generation of 
energy, and regulation of homeostasis via specific vitamin-protein interactions. 
In addition to the well-known physiological roles of vitamins, novel modes of 
action of vitamins have been elucidated. These new functions could contribute to 
extending healthy life expectancy by preventing and curing lifestyle-related 
diseases. In this mini-review, we introduce the functional properties of three 
vitamins, vitamin B3 (niacin), biotin, and vitamin K, for the prevention of 
age-related diseases.

To prevent surgical site infection (SSI), which significantly increases the rate 
morbidity and mortality, eliminating microorganisms is prominent. Antimicrobial 
resistance is identified as a global health challenge. This work proposes a new 
strategy to eliminate microorganisms of deep tissue through electrical 
stimulation with an ultrasound (US)-driven implantable, biodegradable, and 
vibrant triboelectric nanogenerator (IBV-TENG). After a programmed lifetime, the 
IBV-TENG can be eliminated by provoking the on-demand device dissolution by 
controlling US intensity with no surgical removal of the device from the body. A 
voltage of ≈4 V and current of ≈22 µA generated from IBV-TENG under ultrasound 
in vitro, confirming inactivating ≈100% of Staphylococcus aureus and ≈99% of 
Escherichia coli. Furthermore, ex vivo results show that IBV-TENG implanted 
under porcine tissue successfully inactivates bacteria. This antibacterial 
technology is expected to be a countermeasure strategy against SSIs, increasing 
life expectancy and healthcare quality by preventing microorganisms of deep 
tissue.

INTRODUCTION: Conducting older adult-specific clinical trials can help overcome 
the lack of clinical evidence for older adults due to their underrepresentation 
in clinical trials. Understanding factors contributing to the successful 
completion of such trials can help trial sponsors and researchers prioritize 
studies and optimize study design. We aimed to develop a model that predicts 
trial failure among older adult-specific cancer clinical trials using 
trial-level factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified phase 2-4 interventional cancer clinical 
trials that ended between 2008 and 2019 and had the minimum age limit of 
60 years old or older using Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov data. We 
defined trial failure as closed early for reasons other than interim results or 
toxicity or completed with a sample of <85% of the targeted size. Candidate 
trial-level predictors were identified from a literature review. We evaluated 
eight types of machine learning algorithms to find the best model. Model fitting 
and testing were performed using 5-fold nested cross-validation. We evaluated 
the model performance using the area under receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: Of 209 older adult-specific clinical trials, 87 were failed trials per 
the definition of trial failure. The model with the highest AUROC in the 
validation set was the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (AUROC in 
the test set = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53, 0.86). Trial-level 
factors included in the best model were the study sponsor, the number of 
participating centers, the number of modalities, the level of restriction on 
performance score, study location, the number of arms, life expectancy 
restriction, and the number of target size. Among these factors, the number of 
centers (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.94), study being in non-US only 
vs. US only (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.82), and life expectancy restriction 
(OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.73) were significantly associated with the trial 
failure.
DISCUSSION: We identified trial-level factors predictive of trial failure among 
older adult-specific clinical trials and developed a prediction model that can 
help estimate the risk of failure before a study is conducted. The study 
findings could aid in the design and prioritization of future older 
adult-specific clinical trials.
