determined using the World Health Organization database. Incidence of IHD, HALE 
and smoking rate were determined using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study 2015 database. Gross domestic product per capita, 
percentage of population > 65 years old, and health expenditure were determined 
using the World Bank database. Education years were obtained from the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute for 
Statistics. Associations between TJDS and obesity, IHD and HALE were examined in 
132 countries with a population of 1 million or greater using a general linear 
model controlled for co-variables.
RESULTS: TJDS was distributed from -6 to 7. TJDS was inversely correlated to 
obesity (β±SE; -0.70±0.19, p<0.001), IHD (-19.4±4.3, p<0.001), and positively 
correlated to HALE (0.40±0.14, p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: TJDS is a good indicator of a healthy diet, and applies to 
preventing obesity, IHD and extending HALE.

Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs have been reported to be 
cost-effective in many high-income countries. However, there was no such study 
in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to evaluate 
cost-effectiveness and budget impact of CRC screening modalities for 
average-risk persons in Thailand.Methods: A decision tree coupled with a Markov 
model was used to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits of fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) and colonoscopy using a societal perspective. The 
input parameters were obtained from a CRC screening project at a Thai tertiary 
care hospital, Thai health care costs and databases, and systematic literature 
review. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
in 2017 US Dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter 
uncertainty. Finally, budget impact analysis was conducted.Results: At the Thai 
ceiling threshold of societal willingness-to-pay of 4,706 USD, the screening 
colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT, starting at age 50, was 
cost-effective, as compared to no screening resulting in 15.09 and 15.00 QALYs 
with the ICERs of 600.20 and 509.84 USD/QALY gained, respectively. Colonoscopy 
every 10 years and annual FIT could prevent 17.9% and 5.7% of early stage cancer 
and 27.8% and 9.2% of late stage cancer per 100,000 screening over lifetime when 
compared to no screening, respectively. The colonoscopy screening was 
cost-effective with the ICER of 646.53 USD/QALY gained when compared to FIT. The 
probabilities of being cost-effective for the colonoscopy and FIT were 75% and 
25%, respectively. Budget impact analysis showed the colonoscopy screening 
required an 8-times higher budget than FIT.Conclusions: Colonoscopy offers the 
best value for money of CRC screenings in Thailand. Annual FIT is potentially 
feasible since it requires less resources. Our findings can be used as part of 
evidence for informing policy decision making.Key points for decision 
makersThere was a lack of cost-effective study of colorectal cancer screening 
programs in low- and middle-income countries.This study evaluated lifetime 
health outcomes and costs, and the cost-effectiveness of colorectal screening 
options for average-risk persons in Thailand.Colonoscopy screening every 10 
years is cost-effective with high probability of being cost-effective as 
compared with annual fecal immunochemical test.Screening by annual fecal 
immunochemical test is more feasible in terms of human resource and budgetary 
burden.Colorectal screening programs provides an opportunity for early diagnosis 
and treatments to prevent advance colorectal stages and avoid higher consequent 
costs.This study contributes a new evidence-based knowledge for Thailand and can 
be used to support policy decision making process.
