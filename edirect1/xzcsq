Development in terms of Oxytocin Receptor Desensitization in the Fetal Brain.

This paper develops a mathematical model describing the potential buildup of 
high oxytocin concentrations in the maternal circulation during labor in terms 
of continuous Pitocin infusion rate, half-life, and maternal weight. Oxytocin 
override of the degradation of oxytocin by placental oxytocinase is introduced 
to model the potential transfer of oxytocin from the maternal circulation across 
the placenta into the fetal circulation and from there into the brain of the 
fetus. The desensitization unit D equal to 1.8E6 (pg·min)/ml is employed to 
establish a desensitization threshold and by extension, a downregulation 
threshold as a function of oxytocin override concentration and continuous 
Pitocin infusion time, that could be a factor in the subsequent development of 
autism among offspring. Epidemiological studies by Duke University [1], Yale 
University [2], and Harvard University [3] are discussed regarding Pitocin use 
and offspring autism development for an explanation of the weak correlations 
they identified. The findings of the Harvard epidemiological study are 
reinterpreted regarding Pitocin use and its conclusion questioned. Further 
evaluations of the findings of these three epidemiological studies are called 
for to incorporate medical information on quantity of Pitocin used, continuous 
Pitocin infusion rate, length of labor, and maternal weight to determine if a 
correlation can be established with offspring autism development above an 
empirically determined desensitization threshold for Pitocin use. Suggestions 
for research are discussed, including an alternative to continuous Pitocin 
infusion, pulsatile infusion of Pitocin during labor induction, which may 
mitigate possible offspring autism development.

Background: A detrimental consequence of diet-induced weight loss, common in 
athletes who participate in weight cutting sports, is muscle loss. Dietary 
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) exhibit a protective effect on the 
loss of muscle tissue during catabolic situations such as injury-simulated leg 
immobilization. This study aimed to investigate the influence of dietary n-3PUFA 
supplementation on changes in body composition and muscle strength following 
short-term diet-induced weight loss in resistance-trained men. Methods: Twenty 
resistance-trained young (23 ± 1 years) men were randomly assigned to a fish oil 
group that supplemented their diet with 4 g n-3PUFA, 18 g carbohydrate, and 5 g 
protein (FO) or placebo group containing an equivalent carbohydrate and protein 
content (CON) over a 6 week period. During weeks 1-3, participants continued 
their habitual diet. During week 4, participants received all food items to 
control energy balance and a macronutrient composition of 50% carbohydrate, 35% 
fat, and 15% protein. During weeks 5 and 6, participants were fed an 
energy-restricted diet equivalent to 60% habitual energy intake. Body 
composition and strength were measured during weeks 1, 4, and 6. Results: The 
decline in total body mass (FO = -3.0 ± 0.3 kg, CON = -2.6 ± 0.3 kg), fat free 
mass (FO = -1.4 ± 0.3 kg, CON = -1.2 ± 0.3 kg) and fat mass (FO = -1.4 ± 0.2 kg, 
CON = -1.3 ± 0.3 kg) following energy restriction was similar between groups 
(all p > 0.05; d: 0.16-0.39). Non-dominant leg extension 1 RM increased (6.1 ± 
3.4%) following energy restriction in FO (p < 0.05, d = 0.29), with no changes 
observed in CON (p > 0.05, d = 0.05). Dominant leg extension 1 RM tended to 
increase following energy restriction in FO (p = 0.09, d = 0.29), with no 
changes in CON (p > 0.05, d = 0.06). Changes in leg press 1 RM, maximum 
voluntary contraction and muscular endurance following energy restriction were 
similar between groups (p > 0.05, d = 0.05). Conclusion: Any possible 
improvements in muscle strength during short-term weight loss with n-3PUFA 
supplementation are not related to the modulation of FFM in resistance-trained 
men.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent, progressive and irreversible, 
neurodegenerative disease with no disease modifying treatment yet available. The 
projected burden of AD on our healthcare system is immense and thus there is an 
immediate need for new drugs that prevent or attenuate AD symptoms. While most 
efforts in the field are directed at treatments that reduce amyloid or tau 
burden in the brain, we have taken an alternate approach - a model based on 
reducing AD-associated neuronal cell cycle events. Using this model, we have 
screened a largely unexplored source of compounds with therapeutic potential - 
the natural products created by diverse strains of marine bacteria. Two hundred 
and twenty-five bacterial extracts from different strains were tested for both 
toxicity and neuroprotective properties by crystal violet and In-cell Western 
- first in HT22 cells and then in mouse primary neuronal cultures. Based on 
these screens, we have identified several promising leads, and here we focus on 
the most promising of these. We found that we could directly assay even a crude 
bacterial extract in our E16 mouse cortical neuronal cultures and screen for 
activities that prevent cell cycle reentry and preserve synaptic structure. 
Preliminary tests in 1-month-old animals from a mouse model of Ataxia 
telangiectasia, showed that blockage of cell cycle-related neuronal death could 
also be successful in vivo. This adds an important extension to our in vitro 
studies. These findings showcase a new effective and efficient assay system and 
validate the use of marine natural compounds as a novel source for new drugs to 
fight Alzheimer's disease. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14733.

University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Apixaban, an oral anticoagulant for stroke and systemic embolism 
prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), was superior to warfarin 
in prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, bleeding outcomes and mortality 
(ARISTOTLE trial), and substantially reduced stroke risk, with no significant 
increase in major or intracranial bleeding risk versus aspirin (AVERROES trial).
OBJECTIVE: Estimate cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus other anticoagulants 
for NVAF treatment in Saudi Arabia.
DESIGN: Lifetime Markov model.
SETTING: A published model was adapted from the United Kingdom (UK) to the Saudi 
Arabia setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The model enabled pairwise comparisons of apixaban against 
other anticoagulants, aspirin, and aspirin+clopidogrel. Apart from warfarin and 
aspirin, comparisons were indirect. Subpopulations included vitamin K antagonist 
(VKA) suitable and unsuitable patients. Medication and physician visit costs 
were from published lists. A cost ratio (0.533), from comparison of UK and Saudi 
physician visit costs, was applied to UK model inputs to estimate local event 
costs. Background life expectancy was from Saudi life tables. Model structure, 
treatment comparators, patient characteristics, event rates, and utilities were 
unchanged. Costs and health benefits were discounted by 3.5% annually.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
SAMPLE SIZE: Model cohort of 1000 NVAF patients, for VKA suitable and VKA 
unsuitable populations.
RESULTS: Apixaban was dominant versus warfarin (VKA suitable) and rivaroxaban 
(VKA suitable and unsuitable). Compared against dabigatran (110mg, 150 mg, 
110/150mg), the cost/QALY gained for apixaban was $5166, $11 143, $10 849 (VKA 
suitable) and $5 157, $14 424, $14 134 (VKA unsuitable), respectively. Cost/QALY 
for apixaban versus aspirin and aspirin+clopidogrel was $14 805 and $5784 (VKA 
suitable); and $10 564 and $4203 (VKA unsuitable), respectively. Sensitivity 
analyses demonstrated consistency of findings across varying inputs.
CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban was found to be cost-effective for stroke prevention among 
Saudi NVAF patients, when assessed using a US$20 000 willingness-to-pay 
threshold.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of robust local clinical, cost and utility data for model 
inputs. Lack of head-to-head clinical trial data for rivaroxaban, dabigatran, 
and clopidogrel plus aspirin comparators.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Study was funded by Pfizer Inc. and Bristol Myers-Squibb. 
KO, RS, SAK and AAA received salaries from their respective employers, but did

BACKGROUND: Despite the perceived ethical, personal and health service benefits 
of advance care planning (ACP), the extent to which older and seriously ill 
Australian inpatients have considered future health decisions remains uncertain. 
This study aimed to determine in a sample of older and seriously ill inpatients, 
the proportion who had: 1) engaged in four advance care planning (ACP) 
activities; 2) not engaged in ACP activities but wanted to; and 3) reasons why 
they had not engaged.
METHODS: Cross-sectional face-to-face standardised interview survey with 
inpatients in a tertiary referral centre who were either: aged 80+ years; aged 
55+ years with progressive chronic disease(s); or judged by treating clinicians 
as having a life expectancy of less than 12 months. Patients indicated whether 
they had engaged in four ACP activities: (1) appointed medical 
substitute-decision-maker(s), (2) recorded end-of-life wishes in an advance 
directive or care plan; and talked about their end-of-life wishes with their: 
(3) support persons and/or (4) doctors. Patients who had not engaged in 
activities were asked whether they wished this to occur and reasons why.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six inpatients consented to the study (80% of 
approached). Of these, 9% (n = 16) had engaged in four ACP activities; 27% 
(n = 50) had not engaged in any. Half (n = 94, 52%) had appointed a medical 
substitute-decision-maker, 27% (n = 50) had recorded wishes in an advance 
directive or care plan, 51% (n = 90) had talked about their end-of-life wishes 
with support persons and 27% (n = 48) had talked with their doctor. Patients who 
wanted to, but had not, engaged in the four ACP activities were unaware they 
could record wishes or appoint decision-makers, or indicated providers had not 
initiated conversations.
CONCLUSION: Relatively few inpatients had engaged in all four ACP activities. 
More inpatients had discussed end of life issues with family and appointed 
substitute decision makers, than completed written documents or talked with 
doctors. Community education and a more active role for community and 
hospital-based providers in supporting patients and families to collaboratively 
resolve end-of-life decisions may increase the probability wishes are known and 
followed.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, over 500,000 people are diagnosed with head and neck 
cancer each year, a disease with major impact on life expectancy and quality of 
life. The purpose of the Netherlands Quality of life and Biomedical Cohort study 
(NET-QUBIC) is to advance interdisciplinary research that aims to optimize 
diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care for head and neck cancer patients and 
their informal caregivers.
METHODS: Using an extensive assessment protocol (electronic clinical record 
form, patient reported outcome measures and fieldwork (interviews and physical 
tests)), clinical data and data on quality of life, demographic and personal 
factors, psychosocial (depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, sleep, mental 
adjustment to cancer, posttraumatic stress), physical (speech, swallowing, oral 
function, malnutrition, physical fitness, neurocognitive function, sexual 
function), lifestyle (physical activity, nutrition, smoking, alcohol, drugs), 
and social factors (social function, social support, work, health care use, and 
costs) are collected and stored in the data warehouse. A longitudinal biobank is 
built with tumor tissue, blood and blood components, saliva samples, and oral 
rinses. An infrastructure for fieldwork and laboratory protocols is established 
at all participating centers. All patients fill out patient reported outcome 
measures before treatment and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months follow-up. 
The interviews, physical tests and biological sample collection are at baseline 
and 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. The protocol for caregivers includes blood 
sampling and oral rinses at baseline and a tailored list of questionnaires, 
administered at the same time points as the patients. In total, 739 HNC patients 
and 262 informal caregivers have been included in 5 out of the 8 HNC centers in 
the Netherlands.
DISCUSSION: By granting access to researchers to the NET-QUBIC data warehouse 
and biobank, we enable new research lines in clinical (e.g. treatment 
optimization in elderly patients), biological (e.g. liquid biopsy analysis for 
relapse detection), health related quality of life (e.g. the impact of toxicity 
on quality of life), and interrelated research (e.g. health related quality of 
life in relation to biomarkers and survival).

BACKGROUND: The stepped-care pathway (SCP) model has previously been found to be 
clinically effective for depressive disorder in some studies, but not all. 
Several groups have suggested that a stepped-care approach is the most 
appropriate in primary care. There is relatively little information, however, 
regarding which specific stepped-care pathway may be best. This analysis aimed 
to determine cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care pathway for depression in 
adults in primary care versus standard care (SC), treatment-as-usual (TAU), and 
online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with 1400 participants and 12-week 
follow-up to assess the impact of the four treatment options on health-related 
quality of life and depression severity. Costs for the groups were calculated on 
the basis of physician, outpatient, and inpatient services using administrative 
data. We then calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using this 
information. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and incremental 
cost-effectiveness scatterplots were created using Monte Carlo simulation with 
10,000 replications. A subgroup analysis was conducted for participants who 
screened as depressed at baseline.
RESULTS: For all participants, TAU was the most expensive followed by CBT, SC, 
and SCP. QALYs were highest in SCP, followed by SC, CBT, and TAU. In the 
depressed subgroup, TAU was still the most expensive, followed by SC, SCP, and 
CBT, while QALYs were still highest in SCP, followed by SC, CBT, and TAU. The 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves suggested that SCP had a higher 
probability for cost-effectiveness than the other three alternatives in all 
participants. In the depressed subgroup, CBT was associated with the highest 
probability of cost-effectiveness for a willingness-to-pay cut-off of less than 
approximately $50,000, while SCP was the highest at a cut-off higher than 
$50,000. There is considerable uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness 
estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that even where there are no clinically 
significant differences in health outcomes between treatment approaches, there 
may be economic benefit from implementing the stepped-care model. While more 
work is required to identify the most clinically effective versions of a 
stepped-care pathway, our findings suggest that the care pathway may have 
potential to improve health care system value.

BACKGROUND: Doubts exist around the value of compiling league tables for 
cost-effectiveness results for health interventions, primarily due to methods 
differences. We aimed to determine if a reasonably coherent league table could 
be compiled using published studies for one high-income country: New Zealand 
(NZ).
METHODS: Literature searches were conducted to identify NZ-relevant studies 
published in the peer-reviewed journal literature between 1 January 2010 and 8 
October 2017. Only studies with the following metrics were included: cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year or disability-adjusted life-year or life-year 
(QALY/DALY/LY). Key study features were abstracted and a summary league table 
produced which classified the studies in terms of cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: A total of 21 cost-effectiveness studies which met the inclusion 
criteria were identified. There were some large methodological differences 
between the studies, particularly in the time horizon (1 year to lifetime) but 
also discount rates (range 0 to 10%). Nevertheless, we were able to group the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) into general categories of being 
reported as cost-saving (19%), cost-effective (71%), and not cost-effective 
(10%). The median ICER (adjusted to 2017 NZ$) was ~ $5000 per QALY/DALY/LY 
(~US$3500). However, for some interventions, there is high uncertainty around 
the intervention effectiveness and declining adherence over time.
CONCLUSIONS: It seemed possible to produce a reasonably coherent league table 
for the ICER values from different studies (within broad groupings) in this 
high-income country. Most interventions were cost-effective and a fifth were 
cost-saving. Nevertheless, study methodologies did vary widely and researchers 
need to pay more attention to using standardised methods that allow their 
results to be included in future league tables.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue has a major influence on the quality of life of people with 
multiple sclerosis. The Fatigue Severity Scale is a frequently used 
patient-reported measure of fatigue impact, but does not generate the health 
state utility values required to inform cost-effectiveness analysis, limiting 
its applicability within decision-making contexts. The objective of this study 
was to use statistical mapping methods to convert Fatigue Severity Scale scores 
to health state utility values from three preference-based measures: the 
EQ-5D-3L, SF-6D and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-8D.
METHODS: The relationships between the measures were estimated through 
regression analysis using cohort data from 1056 people with multiple sclerosis 
in South West England. Estimation errors were assessed and predictive 
performance of the best models as tested in a separate sample (n = 352).
RESULTS: For the EQ-5D and the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-8D, the best 
performing models used a censored least absolute deviation specification, with 
Fatigue Severity Scale total score, age and gender as predictors. For the SF-6D, 
the best performing model used an ordinary least squares specification, with 
Fatigue Severity Scale total score as the only predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we present algorithms to convert Fatigue Severity Scales 
scores to health state utility values based on three preference-based measures. 
These values may be used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years for use in 
cost-effectiveness analyses and to consider the health-related quality of life 
of people with multiple sclerosis, thereby informing health policy decisions.

BACKGROUND: The INTERVAL trial showed that, over a 2-year period, inter-donation 
intervals for whole blood donation can be safely reduced to meet blood 
shortages. We extended the INTERVAL trial for a further 2 years to evaluate the 
longer-term risks and benefits of varying inter-donation intervals, and to 
compare routine versus more intensive reminders to help donors keep 
appointments.
METHODS: The INTERVAL trial was a parallel group, pragmatic, randomised trial 
that recruited blood donors aged 18 years or older from 25 static donor centres 
of NHS Blood and Transplant across England, UK. Here we report on the 
prespecified analyses after 4 years of follow-up. Participants were whole blood 
donors who agreed to continue trial participation on their originally allocated 
inter-donation intervals (men: 12, 10, and 8 weeks; women: 16, 14, and 12 
weeks). They were further block-randomised (1:1) to routine versus more 
intensive reminders using computer-generated random sequences. The prespecified 
primary outcome was units of blood collected per year analysed in the 
intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes related to safety were quality 
of life, self-reported symptoms potentially related to donation, haemoglobin and 
ferritin concentrations, and deferrals because of low haemoglobin and other 
factors. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN24760606, and has 
completed.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 19, 2014, and May 3, 2016, 20 757 of the 38 035 invited 
blood donors (10 843 [58%] men, 9914 [51%] women) participated in the extension 
study. 10 378 (50%) were randomly assigned to routine reminders and 10 379 (50%) 
were randomly assigned to more intensive reminders. Median follow-up was 1·1 
years (IQR 0·7-1·3). Compared with routine reminders, more intensive reminders 
increased blood collection by a mean of 0·11 units per year (95% CI 0·04-0·17; 
p=0·0003) in men and 0·06 units per year (0·01-0·11; p=0·0094) in women. During 
the extension study, each week shorter inter-donation interval increased blood 
collection by a mean of 0·23 units per year (0·21-0·25) in men and 0·14 units 
per year (0·12-0·15) in women (both p<0·0001). More frequent donation resulted 
in more deferrals for low haemoglobin (odds ratio per week shorter 
inter-donation interval 1·19 [95% CI 1·15-1·22] in men and 1·10 [1·06-1·14] in 
women), and lower mean haemoglobin (difference per week shorter inter-donation 
interval -0·84 g/L [95% CI -0·99 to -0·70] in men and -0·45 g/L [-0·59 to -0·31] 
in women) and ferritin concentrations (percentage difference per week shorter 
inter-donation interval -6·5% [95% CI -7·6 to -5·5] in men and -5·3% [-6·5 to 
-4·2] in women; all p<0·0001). No differences were observed in quality of life, 
serious adverse events, or self-reported symptoms (p>0.0001 for tests of linear 
trend by inter-donation intervals) other than a higher reported frequency of 
doctor-diagnosed low iron concentrations and prescription of iron supplements in 
men (p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: During a period of up to 4 years, shorter inter-donation 
intervals and more intensive reminders resulted in more blood being collected 
without a detectable effect on donors' mental and physical wellbeing. However, 
donors had decreased haemoglobin concentrations and more self-reported symptoms 
compared with the initial 2 years of the trial. Our findings suggest that blood 
collection services could safely use shorter donation intervals and more 
intensive reminders to meet shortages, for donors who maintain adequate 
haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores.

INTRODUCTION: approximately eighty million people around the world are living 
with hepatitis C, and 700,000 people die every year, due to hepatitis C related 
complications. In Seychelles, a total of 777 cases of hepatitis C were reported 
from 2002 to 2016, but up to mid of 2016, the cases were not being treated. 
Treatment with Harvoni, a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV), is 
now being offered on the condition that the patient does not, or has stopped, 
injecting drugs. This paper is the first to establish the cost effectiveness of 
treating all cases of hepatitis C in Seychelles with Harvoni, as compared to no 
treatment.
METHODS: data extracted from literature was used to populate an economic model 
to calculate cost-effectiveness from Seychelles' government perspective. The 
model structure was also informed by the systematic review and an accompanying 
grading of economic models using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standard (CHEERS) checklist. A Markov model was developed, employing a 
lifetime horizon and costs and benefits were analysed from a payer's perspective 
and combined into incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: the direct-acting antiviral (DAA), Harvoni, was found to be cost-saving 
in Seychelles hepatitis C virus (HCV) cohort, as compared to no treatment, with 
an ICER of € 753.65/QALY. The treatment was also cost-saving when stratified by 
gender, with the ICER of male and female being € 783.74/QALY and € 635.20/QALY, 
respectively. Moreover, the results obtained from acceptability curves showed 
that treating patients with Harvoni is the most cost-effective option, even for 
low thresholds.
CONCLUSION: treating hepatitis C cases in Seychelles is cost-saving. It is worth 
developing a treatment programme to include all cases of hepatitis C, regardless 
of status of drug injection.

Patients with a functionally univentricular heart who have had an atriopulmonary 
Fontan are at risk for atrial dilatation, atrial arrhythmias, and progressive 
circulatory failure. Between 1994 and 2018, we performed 149 Fontan conversions 
with arrhythmia surgery and epicardial pacemaker placement at Ann & Robert H. 
Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. This operation converts the atriopulmonary 
Fontan to an extracardiac Fontan that improves hemodynamics and controls the 
atrial arrhythmias. Operative mortality during that time was 2%, and freedom 
from death or heart transplant at 10 years is 84%. For properly selected 
patients, Fontan conversion improves both survival and quality of life. Patients 
with an atriopulmonary Fontan constitute an eroding population, as they face 
many comorbidities and have a decreased life expectancy without treatment; 
therefore, all patients with an atriopulmonary Fontan should be evaluated for 
this procedure.

Bifidobacterium infantis, a Gram-positive bacterium, is one of the commonly used 
probiotics. We previously showed that B. infantis modified host defense systems 
and extended the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the present 
study, we showed that the lifespan extension caused by B. infantis was enhanced 
in animals having a mutation in the tol-1 gene that encodes the sole C. elegans 
homolog of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Meanwhile, lifespan increased by other 
probiotic bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis or Clostridium butyricum, was not 
affected in the tol-1 mutant animals. A microarray analysis revealed that the 
expression of innate immune response-related genes was significantly increased 
in the tol-1 mutant. Worms with the tol-1 mutation exhibited reduced leaving 
behavior from the B. infantis lawn, while canonical downstream factors 
trf-1/TRAF and ikb-1/IκB appeared to not be involved. In conclusion, C. elegans 
tol-1/TLR regulates B. infantis-induced longevity and also regulates behavior 
against B. infantis.

BACKGROUND: Women with Down syndrome have a lower breast cancer risk and 
significantly lower life expectancies than women without Down syndrome. 
Therefore, it is not clear whether mammography screening strategies used for 
women without Down syndrome would benefit women with Down syndrome in the same 
way.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the benefits and harms of various mammography screening 
strategies for women with Down syndrome using collaborative simulation modeling.
DESIGN: Two established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network 
(CISNET) simulation models estimated the benefits and harms of various screening 
strategies for women with Down syndrome over a lifetime horizon.
PARTICIPANTS: We modeled a hypothetical cohort of US women with Down syndrome 
who were born in 1970.
INTERVENTIONS: Annual, biennial, triennial, and one-time digital mammography 
screenings during the ages 40-74.
MAIN MEASURES: The models estimated numbers of mammograms, false-positives, 
benign biopsies, breast cancer deaths prevented, and life-years gained per 1000 
screened women when compared with no screening.
KEY RESULTS: In average-risk women 50-74, biennial screening incurred 122 
mammograms, 10 false-positive mammograms, and 1.4 benign biopsies per one 
life-year gained compared with no screening. In women with Down syndrome, the 
same screening strategy incurred 2752 mammograms, 242 false-positive mammograms, 
and 34 benign biopsies per one life-year gained compared with no screening. The 
harm/benefit ratio varied for other screening strategies, and was most favorable 
for one-time screening at age 50, which incurred 1629 mammograms, 144 
false-positive mammograms, and 20 benign biopsies per one life-year gained 
compared with no screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The harm/benefit ratios for various mammography screening 
strategies in women with Down syndrome are not as favorable as those for 
average-risk women. The benefit of screening mammography for women with Down 
syndrome is less pronounced due to lower breast cancer risk and shorter life 
expectancy.

Anterior trunk muscle shows mix of axial and appendicular developmental 
patterns.

BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle in the trunk derives from the somites, paired 
segments of paraxial mesoderm. Whereas axial musculature develops within the 
somite, appendicular muscle develops following migration of muscle precursors 
into lateral plate mesoderm. The development of muscles bridging axial and 
appendicular systems appears mixed.
RESULTS: We examine development of three migratory muscle precursor-derived 
muscles in zebrafish: the sternohyoideus (SH), pectoral fin (PF), and posterior 
hypaxial (PHM) muscles. We show there is an anterior to posterior gradient to 
the developmental gene expression and maturation of these three muscles. SH 
muscle precursors exhibit a long delay between migration and differentiation, PF 
muscle precursors exhibit a moderate delay in differentiation, and PHM muscle 
precursors show virtually no delay between migration and differentiation. Using 
lineage tracing, we show that lateral plate contribution to the PHM muscle is 
minor, unlike its known extensive contribution to the PF muscle and absence in 
the ventral extension of axial musculature.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that PHM development is intermediate between a migratory 
muscle mode and an axial muscle mode of development, wherein the PHM 
differentiates after a very short migration of its precursors and becomes more 
anterior primarily by elongation of differentiated muscle fibers.

Although collaborative care was adopted in several countries, including Canada, 
to improve the health and social services system, partnerships are often 
experienced as challenging. In many cases, transformative partnership remains a 
political rhetoric rather than a practical reality. This article presents an 
analysis of partnership relationships in youth mental health (YMH) using 
insights from game theory and a qualitative analysis of interactions during 
transcultural interinstitutional and interdisciplinary case discussion seminars 
(TIICDSs). Drawing on the analysis of 40 seminar sessions and six focus groups 
with seminar participants conducted in Montréal (Canada) between October 2013 
and April 2015, this article interrogates the conditions and processes present 
in TIICDSs that contribute to building and strengthening YMH partnerships, 
examining how tensions among TIICDS participants are attended to. Research 
results indicate that TIICDSs can be seen as a game operating under different 
rules than real-life clinical work. They are characterized by the establishment 
of a climate of trust and respect, a high value placed on diversity and 
creativity, a concern for affects and power dynamics, a process of inclusive 
dialogue and negotiation, and a consideration for continuity. The game rules 
allow participants to safely apprehend a situation from a different perspective, 
a key competence in intercultural and collaborative YMH care. Results also 
indicate that participants complexify their representations by playing with 
divergent perceptions of people and situations and that enhanced case 
formulations are collective game outcomes. In light of our findings, tensions in 
collaborations can be seen as constituting both obstacles that can be 
counterproductive if not attended to, as well as powerful and useful learning 
tools that, under certain conditions, can support the clinical process and 
contribute to partnership building. Some clinical and partnership impasses may 
be overcome through clinical case discussions that allow partners to address 
these tensions and negotiate power relationships.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a core enzyme of the aerobic 
glycolytic pathway with versatile functions and is associated with cancer 
development. Recently, Kornberg et al . published the detailed correlation 
between GAPDH and di- or monomethyl fumarate (DMF or MMF), which are well-known 
GAPDH antagonists in the immune system. As an extension, herein, we report the 
crystal structure of MMF-bound human GAPDH at 2.29 Å. The MMF molecule is 
covalently linked to the catalytic Cys152 of human GAPDH, and inhibits the 
catalytic activity of the residue and dramatically reduces the enzymatic 
activity of GAPDH. Structural comparisons between NAD+bound GAPDH and MMF-bound 
GAPDH revealed that the covalently linked MMF can block the binding of the NAD+ 
cosubstrate due to steric hindrance of the nicotinamide portion of the NAD+ 
molecule, illuminating the specific mechanism by which MMF inhibits GAPDH. Our 
data provide insights into GAPDH antagonist development for GAPDH-mediated 
disease treatment.

Household nutrition is influenced by interactions between food security and 
local knowledge negotiated along multiple axes of power. Such processes are 
situated within political and economic systems from which structural 
inequalities are reproduced at local, national, and global scales. Health 
beliefs and food taboos are two manifestations that emerge within these 
processes that may contribute beneficial, benign, or detrimental health 
outcomes. This study explores the social dimensions of food taboos and health 
beliefs in rural Khatlon province, Tajikistan and their potential impact on 
household-level nutrition. Our analysis considers the current and historical 
and political context of Tajikistan, with particular attention directed towards 
evolving gender roles in the wake of mass out-migration of men from 1990 to the 
present. Considering the patrilieneal, patrilocal social system typical to 
Khatlon, focus group discussions were conducted with the primary decision-making 
groups of the household: in-married women, mothers-in-law, and men. During focus 
groups, participants discussed age- and gender-differentiated taboos that call 
for avoidance of several foods central to the Tajik diet during sensitive 
periods in the life cycle when micronutrient and energy requirements peak: 
infancy and early childhood (under 2 years of age), pregnancy, and lactation. 
Participants described dynamic and complex processes of knowledge 
sharing and food practices that challenge essentialist depictions of 
local knowledges. Our findings are useful for exploring entaglements of gender 
and health that play out across multiple spatial and temporal scales. While this 
study is situated in the context of nutrition and agriculture extension, we hope 
researchers and practitioners of diverse epistemologies will draw connections to 
diverse areas of inquiry and applications.
