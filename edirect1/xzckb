Few studies have investigated associations of milestone development in early 
childhood with intelligence in adulthood in typically developing children. The 
current study is an extension of 2 previous studies on smaller samples and 
investigated associations of age at attainment of 32 developmental milestones 
attained between 0 and 3 years of age with adult intelligence and explored 
whether the effects of early infant milestones are mediated through later 
development during subsequent years. Mothers of 8,400 children from the 
Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort recorded 32 developmental milestones during the 
child's first 3 years of life. Information on at least 1 developmental milestone 
was available for 2 subsamples with adult follow-up information on intelligence: 
Børge Priens Prøve (BPP) was available for 2,567 men while Wechsler Adult 
Intelligence Scale (WAIS) was available for 1,000 men and women. The study found 
that early attainment of milestones, primarily those related to standing/walking 
and language development, was associated with higher intelligence in adulthood. 
The adjusted BPP means were 103.7, 101.7, and 99.5, respectively, for being able 
to name objects/animals in pictures at less than 18 months, 18-24 months, and 
later than 24 months. Mediation analyses showed direct associations of the 
1-year milestones related to standing/walking with intelligence with the direct 
association accounting for 74.6% and 64.4% of the total association in each 
subsample. Thus, milestones related to standing and walking primarily show a 
direct association with adult intelligence and are to a smaller extent mediated 
by milestones reflecting development during the subsequent years, in particular 
language development. (PsycINFO Database Record

Frailty is consequent to age-dependent deregulation of several biological 
pathways and systems, encompassing namely sarcopenia, age-associated hormonal 
derangements, inflammation, and nutritional or metabolic deficiencies. Although 
the prevalence of frailty is usually between 10% and 20% in the general elderly 
population, its overall burden will increase exponentially along with the 
predictable prolongation of life expectancy. Risk prediction and early diagnosis 
will hence become pivotal for mitigating the clinical, social, and economic 
impact of this condition. The currently available research suggests that no 
single laboratory biomarker can efficiently help predicting or diagnosing 
frailty. However, its multifaceted pathogenesis suggests that a multi-marker 
approach, preceded by preliminary identification of specific proteomic 
signatures, may be the most promising strategy in frailty diagnostics. Areas 
covered: This review critically analyzes recent proteomic studies exploring 
protein profiles in non-frail and frail subjects. Expert commentary: Results of 
some recent proteomic studies attest that muscle proteome, chronic low-grade 
inflammation (inflammaging), along with characteristic vascular and hemostasis 
proteomic profiles, may help predict or diagnose frailty. Larger prospective 
studies are needed for confirming these findings and enabling their replication 
in real life scenarios. Albeit proteomic research in the field of age-dependent 
biologic impairment is in embryo, proteomics holds the greatest potential in 
frailty diagnostics.

The TG interacting factor-1 homeodomain (TGIF1-HD) binds with the consensus DNA 
motif 5'-TGTCA-3' in gene promoters through its three-amino acid loop extension 
(TALE) type homeodomain, and then recruits co-regulators to regulate gene 
expression. Although the solution NMR structure of human TGIF1-HD has been 
reported previously, little is known about its DNA binding mechanism. NMR 
titrations have been extensively used to study mechanisms of ligand binding to 
target proteins; however, an intermediate exchange occurred predominantly 
between TGIF1-HD in the free and bound states when titrated with the consensus 
DNA, which resulted in poor-quality NMR spectra and precluded further 
exploration of its interaction interface and conformational dynamics. Here, the 
helix α3 of TGIF1-HD was speculated as the specific DNA binding interface by 
hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, and 
subsequently confirmed by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) 
spectroscopy. In addition, simultaneous conformational changes in other regions, 
including α1 and α2, were induced by DNA binding, explaining the observation of 
chemical shift perturbations from extensive residues besides those located in 
α3. Further, low-populated DNA-bound TGIF1-HD undergoing a slow exchange at a 
rate of 130.2 ± 3.6 s-1 was derived from the analysis of the CEST data, and two 
residues, R220 and R221, located in the middle of α3 were identified to be 
crucial for DNA binding. Our study provides structural and dynamic insights into 
the mechanisms of TGIF1-HD recognition of extensive promoter DNA.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Long-term mechanical assist devices are now commonly used in 
the treatment of severe heart failure to unload the failing ventricle, maintain 
sufficient end-organ perfusion and improve functional capacity. Depending on the 
assisted ventricles, 3 categories of long-term assist devices are available: 
left ventricular assist device (LVAD), biventricular assist device and total 
artificial heart. Improvements in technology, especially the advent of smaller, 
durable continuous flow pumps, have led to the use of LVADs in a much broader 
population of patients in the last 10 years. Both the number of patients living 
with LVADs and the life expectancy of these patients are increasing. Regarding 
this growing number of patients with LVAD, intensivists need to understand the 
physiology of the devices, their functioning, potential complications and their 
management.
METHODS: We performed a narrative review of relevant medical literature 
regarding the physiology of patients with LVAD and management of common 
complications relevant to the critical care physicians.
RESULTS: The most frequent complications occurring in the LVAD patients after 
the post-operative period are bleeding, driveline infections, thrombosis, device 
malfunction, right ventricular failure and arrhythmias. Bleeding is the most 
frequent adverse event in LVAD due to a combination of anticoagulation and 
acquired von Willebrand disease secondary to shear stress produced within the 
pump. Their management includes antiplatelet therapy arrest, reduction of the 
anticoagulation regimen and specific therapy if feasible. Infection is the 
second most common cause of death after cardiac failure in LVAD patients. All 
infections must be aggressively treated to avoid seeding the device. Device 
thrombosis can develop even when patients are adequately anticoagulated and 
taking antiplatelet therapy because the LVAD is responsible for a chronic 
hypercoagulable state.
CONCLUSION: Management of these unique patients in the ICU is best accomplished 
with a multidisciplinary team that includes specialists in advanced heart 
failure, LVAD nurse coordinators and intensivists.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent for patients 
with open-angle glaucoma in Colombia.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of trabecular micro bypass stent 
vs laser trabeculoplasty or medications only, for patients with open-angle 
glaucoma in a setting of the Colombian System Health.
METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis that based its assumptions in 
external data sources, used to extrapolate the quality-of-life related to 
health, survival, and costs. A Markov model, with stages from 0 (ocular 
hypertension without glaucoma) to 5 and bilateral blindness, was developed 
inclusive of Colombians older than 40 years in 2018, from a societal 
perspective, comparing trabecular micro-bypass stents vs laser trabeculoplasty, 
timolol + dorzolamide + brimonidine, timolol + dorzolamide + latanoprost, or 
timolol + dorzolamide + brimatoprost, in terms of clinical and economic outcomes 
over a lifetime horizon. Both costs and health outcomes had an annual rate 
discount of 5%. Health outcomes were evaluated in terms of QALYs related with 
loss of visual acuity. Trabecular micro-bypass costs include the joint use of 
timolol, and the costs of laser trabeculoplasty include the combined use of 
timolol + dorzolamide.
RESULTS: Trabecular micro-bypass stents were estimated to have 127,971 more 
discounted QALYs vs laser trabeculoplasty; 405,982 vs 
timolol + dorzolamide + brimonidine; and 378,287 vs 
timolol + dorzolamide + latanoprost or timolol + dorzolamide + brimatoprost. 
Cumulative costs with trabecular micro-bypass stents at 40 years was $13,252,318 
lower than laser trabeculoplasty; $6,403,534, lower than 
timolol + dorzolamide + brimonidine; $22,311,064, lower than 
timolol + dorzolamide + latanoprost; and $29,156,113 lower than 
timolol + dorzolamide + brimatoprost.
CONCLUSIONS: The trabecular micro-bypass stent is a highly cost-saving strategy 
due to more QALYs related to a lower rate of the population with loss of visual 
acuity in the long-term, and because the costs associated with additional 
medications and complications are lower with trabecular micro-bypass stents.

OBJECTIVES: Incidence-based mortality quantifies the distribution of cancer 
deaths and life-years lost, according to age at detection. We investigated the 
temporal distribution of the disease burden, and the effect of starting and 
stopping ages and interval between screening mammography examinations, on 
incidence-based mortality.
METHODS: Incidence-based mortality was estimated using an established breast 
cancer simulation model, adapted and validated to simulate breast cancer 
incidence, screening performance, and delivery of therapies in Canada. Ten 
strategies were examined, with varying starting age (40 or 50), stopping age (69 
or 74), and interval (1, 2, 3 years), and "No Screening." Life-years lost were 
computed as the difference between model predicted time of breast cancer death 
and that estimated from life tables.
RESULTS: Without screening, 70% of the burden in terms of breast cancer deaths 
extends between ages 45 and 75. The mean of the distribution of ages of 
detection of breast cancers that will be fatal in an unscreened population is 
61.8 years, while the mean age of detection weighted by the number of life-years 
lost is 55, a downward shift of 6.8 years. Similarly, the mean age of detection 
for the distribution of life-years gained through screening is lower than that 
for breast cancer deaths averted.
CONCLUSION: Incidence-based mortality predictions from modeling elucidate the 
age dependence of the breast cancer burden and can provide guidance for 
optimizing the timing of screening regimens to achieve maximal impact. Of the 
regimens studied, the greatest lifesaving effect was achieved with annual 
screening beginning at age 40.

Ageing populations represent a challenge to the sustainability of current 
healthcare systems. The need to balance these demographic changes with gains in 
healthy life years and quality of life (QoL) constitutes an additional 
challenge. Aware of this, the European Commission (EC) launched the European 
Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIPonAHA) in 2012. The 
EIPonAHA is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector initiative involving more than 
3000 partners with two specific objectives: to increase the healthy life 
expectancy of Europeans by two years by 2020, while increasing their QoL. The 
initiatives of the EIPonAHA have been organized according to six thematic action 
groups (AGs), with the A3 group targeting areas relating to the prevention of 
functional decline and frailty. In addition to the good practices of partners, 
there are several on-going collaborative works. The involvement of the EC 
includes support through an elaborated research programme in which the 
Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency (CHAFEA) and the 
Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG 
CONNECT) are the main funding bodies. Screening approaches and preventive 
interventions constitute most of the initiatives within the A3 AG. Partners are 
distributed across five sub-groups according to good practices: i) cognitive 
decline, ii) food and nutrition, iii) physical activity, iv) caregivers, and v) 
frailty and functional decline. Regular updates of the progression of both good 
practices and collaborative works are presented in A3 AG meetings. The 2017 
meeting in Valencia, Spain, showcased in this paper, provides an up-to-date 
overview of the current status of A3 activities.

OBJECTIVES: Metabolic syndrome (MS) affects a quarter of Polish people and is 
associated with diabetes mellitus type 2 and ischemic heart disease. The 
prevalence of MS in postmenopausal women can be increased by the lack of 
protective effects of oestrogens. In the near future, because of the general 
increase in life expectancy, the number of postmenopausal women will rise 
substantially. Therefore, investigating both the environmental and the genetic 
factors predisposing to MS may have a great impact on women's health. The aim of 
this study was to determine whether particular oestrogen receptor (ESR) gene 
polymorphisms can predispose to the development of MS in women after menopause.
STUDY DESIGN: The sample consisted of 147 postmenopausal women. In addition to 
collecting medical history and analyzing body composition using the TANITA 
scale, patient's waist size, blood pressure, serum lipids, glucose, insulin, 
C-reactive protein and adiponectin were measured. The analysis of ESR gene 
polymorphisms was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform.
RESULTS: Three out of ten analyzed polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene (rs2234693, 
rs6902771, rs7774230) and one out of eight analyzed polymorphisms in the ESR2 
gene (rs3020449) were associated with MS. The ESR1 rs2234693, rs6902771 and 
rs7774230 polymorphisms were associated with serum concentrations of 
high-density lipoproteins. The ESR2 rs3020449 polymorphism was associated with 
serum concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Four ESR1 
polymorphisms (rs1709183, rs2234693, rs6902771, rs7774230) were associated with 
total fat tissue content.
CONCLUSIONS: Bearing the particular alleles at the ESR gene polymorphisms may 
impact the development of MS and some of the ESR polymorphisms may influence 
serum cholesterol concentrations in women after menopause.

The benefits of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for HIV replication 
and transmission control have led to its universal recommendation. Many people 
living with HIV are, however, still undiagnosed or diagnosed late, especially in 
sub-Saharan Africa, where the HIV disease burden is highest. Further expansion 
in HIV treatment options, incorporating women-centred approaches, is essential 
to make individualised care a reality. With a longer life expectancy than 
before, people living with HIV are at an increased risk of developing non-AIDS 
comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Antiretroviral 
strategies are evolving towards a decrease in drug burden, and some two-drug 
combinations have proven efficacy for maintenance therapy. Investigational 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and broadly neutralising antibodies with effector 
functions have energised the HIV cure research field as the search for an 
effective vaccine continues. In this Seminar, we review advances and challenges 
relating to the goal of an AIDS-free world.

The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large macromolecular assembly of around 30 
different proteins, so-called nucleoporins (Nups). Embedded in the nuclear 
envelope the NPC mediates bi-directional exchange between the cytoplasm and the 
nucleus and plays a role in transcriptional regulation that is poorly 
understood. NPCs display modular arrangements with an overall structure that is 
generally conserved among many eukaryotic phyla. However, Nups of yeast or human 
origin show little primary sequence conservation with those from early-branching 
protozoans leaving those of the malaria parasite unrecognized. Here we have 
combined bioinformatic and genetic methods to identify and spatially 
characterize Nup components in the rodent infecting parasite Plasmodium berghei 
and identified orthologs from the human malaria parasite P. falciparum, as well 
as the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. For the first time we 
show the localization of selected Nups throughout the P. berghei life cycle. 
Largely restricted to apicomplexans we identify an extended C-terminal 
poly-proline extension in SEC13 that is essential for parasite survival and 
provide high-resolution images of Plasmodium NPCs obtained by cryo electron 
tomography. Our data provide the basis for full characterization of NPCs in 
malaria parasites, early branching unicellular eukaryotes with significant 
impact on human health.

Numerous biomarkers have been unveiled in the rapidly evolving biomarker 
discovery field, with an aim to improve the clinical management of disorders. In 
rare diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, this endeavor has created a 
wealth of knowledge that, if effectively exploited, will benefit affected 
individuals, with respect to health care, therapy, improved quality of life and 
increased life expectancy. The most promising findings and molecular biomarkers 
are inspected in this review, with an aim to provide an overview of currently 
known biomarkers and the technological developments used. Biomarkers as cells, 
genetic variations, miRNAs, proteins, lipids and/or metabolites indicative of 
disease severity, progression and treatment response have the potential to 
improve development and approval of therapies, clinical management of DMD and 
patients' life quality. We highlight the complexity of translating research 
results to clinical use, emphasizing the need for biomarkers, fit for purpose 
and describe the challenges associated with qualifying biomarkers for clinical 
applications.

Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are directly involved into such indispensable to 
life processes as respiration and locomotion. However, motor nerve forms only 
one synaptic contact at each muscle fiber. This unique configuration requires 
specific properties and constrains to be effective. The very high density of 
acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) of muscle type in synaptic cleft and an excess 
of acetylcholine (ACh) released under physiological conditions make this synapse 
extremely reliable. Nevertheless, under pathological conditions such as 
myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndromes, the safety factor can be 
markedly reduced. Drugs used for short-term symptomatic therapy of these 
pathological states, cause partial inhibition of cholinesterases (ChEs). These 
enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of ACh, thus terminate its action on AChRs. 
Extension of the lifetime of ACh molecules compensates muscular AChRs 
abnormalities and, consequently, rescues muscle contractions. In this mini 
review, we will first outline the functional organization of the NMJ, and then, 
consider the concept of the safety factor and how it may be changed. This will 
be followed by a look at autoregulation of ACh release that influences the 
safety factor of NMJs. Finally, we will consider the morphological features of 
NMJs as a putative reserve to increase effectiveness of pathological muscle 
weakness therapy by ChEs inhibitors due to opportunity to use 
micro-pharmacodynamic mechanisms.

Drawing on Eccles' expectancy-value model of achievement-related choices, we 
examined how work values predict individual and gender differences in sciences, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) participations in early adulthood (ages 
of 25/27, 6 or 8 years after postsecondary school), controlling for subjective 
task values attached to academic subjects in late adolescence (11th grade, age 
18). The study examined 1,259 Finnish participants using a person-oriented 
approach. Results showed that: (a) we could identify four profile groups based 
on five core work values (society, family, monetary, career prospects, and 
working with people); (b) work-value profiles predicted young adults actual STEM 
participation in two fields: math-intensive and life science occupations above 
and beyond academic task values (e.g., math/science) and background information; 
(c) work-value profiles also differentiate between those who entered support- 
vs. professional-level STEM jobs; and (d) gender differences in work value 
profiles partially explained the differential representation of women across 
STEM sub-disciplines and the overall underrepresentation of women in STEM 
fields.

This paper investigates the variation in the effects of various determinants on 
the per capita health-care expenditure. A total of 28 Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development countries are studied over the period 1990-2012, 
employing an instrumental variable quantile regression method for a dynamic 
panel model with fixed effects. The results show that the determinants of per 
capita health-care expenditure growth, involving the growth of lagged health 
spending, of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), of physician density, of 
elderly population, of life expectancy, of urbanization, and of female labor 
force participation, do vary with the conditional distribution of the 
health-care expenditure growth, while the changing patterns are dissimilar. 
Moreover, we show that Baumol's model of "unbalanced growth" has a significantly 
positive effect on per capita health spending growth, and its effect is quite 
stable over the entire distribution. However, the correlation between the 
components (wage growth and labor productivity growth) of the "Baumol variable" 
and health expenditure growth is more varied. As a comparison, only the growth 
of lagged health spending, per capita GDP, and the Baumol variable (or its 
components) are found related to health spending growth in conditional mean 
regressions. The prediction results were also quite different between the 
quantile regression dynamic panel instrumental variable models and linear panel 
data models. More attention needs to be paid to the varying influence of 
determinants in health expenditure study.

Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Email: susiari_k@ugm.ac.id

Background: The high prevalence of smokers in Indonesia is also increase the 
number of people as secondhand smokers. Secondhand smoke causes many health 
problems, including cancer. Thus, Indonesia will bear large number cancer burden 
of disease, but research on cancer related to secondhand smoking in Indonesia 
still does not exist. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the number of 
secondhand smoke attributable fractions (SAFs) of six cancers (lung, bladder, 
colorectal, stomach, pancreas and larynx) and burden of cancer caused by 
secondhand smoking in Indonesia using Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) 
indicator. Material and Methods: This research was using descriptive 
epidemiological prevalence-based research design, with cancers prevalence data 
gained from Indonesian health assurance system database in 2016. The SAFs is 
calculated by combining both data of secondhand smoking prevalence and relative 
risk and the DALY indicator is calculated as the sum of years of life lost due 
to premature mortality (YLL) and the equivalent healthy years lost due to 
disability (YLD). Results: Based on SAFs proportion, the highest SAFs among men 
were in pancreas cancer (80.20%), stomach cancer (79.54%) and laryngeal cancer 
(69.61%), whereas in women, pancreas cancer (78.95%), stomach cancer (78.26%) 
and bladder cancer (63.30%). Meanwhile, burden priorities for Indonesian men and 
woman were lung cancer (110,491), colorectal (68,131), and bladder cancer 
(39,140). Conclusions: In total, DALYs 6 cancer diseases due to secondhand smoke 
analyzed in this study were 283,360 DALYs. Thus, the results of the research can 
be used as a basis for further policies making on national cigarette prevention 
and control in Indonesia.

Cancer poses substantial challenges to both physical and mental health of 
patients. On the other hand, breast cancer is one of the most common cancers 
among Iranian women. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate 
the effect of mindfulness-based training on psychological status and quality of 
life (QoL) of patients with breast cancer living in Ilam, Iran. This 
quasi-experimental study was performed on 66 patients diagnosed with breast 
cancer. The patients assigned into two groups of experimental and control. 
Experimental group received mindfulness-based group training through eight 
90-min sessions. Sessions were conducted twice a week and were completed within 
1 month. The research tools included a QoL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), 
Schneider’s life expectancy questionnaire, and the depression anxiety stress 
scale (DASS-21). The questionnaires were completed before and during the 
interviews with the patients 2 months after intervention. Data were analyzed 
using SPSS (version 16) and running descriptive and analytical statistics. 
Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between he 
experimental and control groups considering QoL, life expectancy, depression, 
anxiety, and stress (p>0.05). However, after the intervention, the patients in 
the experimental group reported higher QoL and life expectancy and less severe 
depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05). Considering the positive effect of 
mindfulness-based training on the psychological status and QoL of patients with 
breast cancer, we recommend health nurses conduct mindfulness-based training for 
patients receiving clinical care services.

BACKGROUND: Patients' expectations of the outcomes of rehabilitation may 
influence the outcomes and satisfaction with treatment.
OBJECTIVES: For stroke patients in multidisciplinary rehabilitation, we aimed to 
explore patients' outcome expectations and their fulfilment as well as 
determinants.
METHODS: The Stroke Cohort Outcomes of REhabilitation (SCORE) study included 
consecutive stroke patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility 
after hospitalisation. Outcome expectations were assessed at the start of 
rehabilitation (admission) by using the three-item Expectancy scale (sum score 
range 3-27) of the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ). After 
rehabilitation, patients answered the same questions formulated in the past 
tense to assess fulfilment of expectations. Baseline patient characteristics 
were recorded and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) was measured at 
baseline and after rehabilitation. The number of patients with expectations 
unfulfilled or fulfilled or exceeded was computed by subtracting the admission 
and discharge CEQ Expectancy scores. Multivariable regression analysis was used 
to determine the factors associated with outcome expectations and their 
fulfilment, estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: We included 165 patients (96 males [58.2%], mean (SD) age 60.2 years 
[12.7]) who completed the CEQ Expectancy instrument at admission (median score 
21.6, interquartile range [IQR] 17.0-24.0); 79 completed it both at admission 
(median score 20.6, IQR 16.6-24.4) and follow-up (median score 20.0, IQR 
16.4-22.8). For 40 (50.6%) patients, expectations of therapy were fulfilled or 
exceeded. No patient characteristic at admission was associated with baseline 
CEQ Expectancy score. Odds of expectation fulfilment were associated with low 
expectations at admission (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60-0.83) and improved EQ-5D score 
(OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04-0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: In half of the stroke patients in multidisciplinary rehabilitation, 
expectations were fulfilled or exceeded, most likely in patients with low 
expectations at admission and with improved health-related quality of life. More 
research into the role of health professionals regarding the measurement, 
shaping and management of outcome expectations is needed.

As life expectancy and activity levels of patients increase so does the demand 
on total knee replacements (TKRs). Abnormal mechanics and wear of TKRs can lead 
to implant loosening and early failure. Polyethylene inserts of varying design 
and conformity have been introduced in the past decade to improve stability and 
patient's confidence in the replaced knee, particularly in cases where soft 
tissue support around the knee is sub optimal. This study experimentally 
investigated the effect of variation in the soft tissues on the kinematics and 
wear of a TKR on three different tibial insert designs. DePuy Sigma fixed 
bearing TKRs with moderately cross-linked UHMWPE and the ISO force control 
inputs were used. Different soft tissue constraints were simulated using virtual 
springs in an ISO force controlled simulation system. The spring gaps and 
stiffness' were varied and their effect on the output kinematics and wear rates 
assessed. The lower conformity inserts resulted in significantly higher 
displacements and more variation between the stations on the simulator. They 
were also more sensitive to changes in the soft tissue constraints than the high 
conformity insert. The wear rate for the high tension springs was significantly 
lower than for the lower tension springs tested. Tibial insert geometry and soft 
tissue constraints significantly affected kinematics and wear in these 
experimental simulations. Soft tissue constraints and the variability in 
patients are important considerations in the stratified design of TKRs and 
approach to patient selection.

BACKGROUND: UK deaths due to chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis have 
quadrupled over the last 40 years, making this condition now the third most 
common cause of premature death. Most patients with advanced cirrhosis 
(end-stage liver disease [ESLD]) develop ascites. This is often managed with 
diuretics, but if refractory, then the fluid is drained from the peritoneal 
cavity every 10-14 days by large volume paracentesis (LVP), a procedure 
requiring hospital admissions. As the life expectancy of patients with ESLD and 
refractory ascites (if ineligible for liver transplantation) is on 
average ≤ 6 months, frequent hospital visits are inappropriate from a palliative 
perspective. One alternative is long-term abdominal drains (LTADs), used 
successfully in patients whose ascites is due to malignancy. Although inserted 
in hospital, these drains allow ascites management outside of a hospital 
setting. LTADs have not been formally evaluated in patients with refractory 
ascites due to ESLD.
METHODS/DESIGN: Due to uncertainty about appropriate outcome measures and 
whether patients with ESLD would wish or be able to participate in a study, a 
feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed. Patients were 
consulted on trial design. We plan to recruit 48 patients with refractory 
ascites and randomise them (1:1) to either (1) LTAD or (2) current standard of 
care (LVP) for 12 weeks. Outcomes of interest include acceptability of the LTAD 
to patients, carers and healthcare professionals as well as recruitment and 
retention rates. The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale, the Short Form 
Liver Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, the EuroQol 5 dimensions instrument 
and carer-reported (Zarit Burden Interview) outcomes will also be assessed. 
Preliminary data on cost-effectiveness will be collected, and patients and 
healthcare professionals will be interviewed about their experience of the trial 
with a view to identifying barriers to recruitment.
DISCUSSION: LTADs could potentially improve end-of-life care in patients with 
refractory ascites due to ESLD by improving symptom control, reducing hospital 
visits and enabling some self-management. Our trial is designed to see if such 
patients can be recruited, as well as to inform the design of a subsequent 
definitive trial.
