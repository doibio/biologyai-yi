p < 0.01), 13.6 ± 2.7 points (95 %CI 8.2-19.0 points; p < 0.0001), and 2.4 ± 0.5 
(95 %CI 1.4-3.3; p < 0.0001), respectively. At follow-up, 38 (63 %) patients 
were free from the PTS and none developed contralateral deep vein thrombosis. 
Conclusions: In patients with PTS and common iliac vein compression, treatment 
with the hybrid oblique stent with provisional stent extension resulted in high 
patency rates and improvement in PTS severity and quality of life at 3-month. 
Two-year results of TOPOS will assess the durability of this treatment.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a debilitating and costly disease for our society, 
especially in the case of treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant therapy in 
treatment-resistant unipolar and non-psychotic depression. It can be applied 
according to two therapeutic strategies after an initial rTMS cure: a further 
rTMS cure can be performed at the first sign of relapse or recurrence, or 
systematic maintenance rTMS (M-rTMS) can be proposed. TMS adjuvant to treatment 
as usual (TAU) could improve long-term prognosis. However, no controlled study 
has yet compared the cost-effectiveness of these two additional rTMS therapeutic 
strategies versus TAU alone.
METHODS/DESIGN: This paper focuses on the design of a health-economic, 
prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study with three parallel 
arms carried out in France. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of the 
adjunctive and maintenance low frequency rTMS on the right dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex versus TAU alone. A total of 318 patients suffering from a 
current TRD will be enrolled. The primary endpoint is to investigate the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (ratio costs / quality-adjusted 
life-years [QALY] measured by the Euroqol Five Dimension Questionnaire) over 
12 months in a population of patients assigned to one of three arms: systematic 
M-rTMS for responders (arm A); additional new rTMS cure in case of mood 
deterioration among responders (arm B); and a placebo arm (arm C) in which 
responders are allocated in two subgroups: sham systematic M-rTMS and 
supplementary rTMS course in case of mood deterioration. ICER and QALYs will be 
compared between arm A or B versus arm C. The secondary endpoints in each three 
arms will be: ICER at 24 months; the cost-utility ratio analysis at 12 and 
24 months; 5-year budget impact analysis; and prognosis factors of rTMS. The 
following criteria will be compared between arm A or B and arm C: rates of 
responders; remission and disease-free survival; clinical evolution; tolerance; 
observance; treatment modifications; hospitalization; suicide attempts; work 
stoppage; marital / professional statues; and quality of life at 12 and 
24 months.
DISCUSSION: The purpose of our study is to check the cost-effectiveness of rTMS 
and we will discuss its economic impact over time. In the case of significant 
decrease in the depression costs and expenditures associated with a good 
long-term prognosis (sustained response and remission) and tolerance, rTMS could 
be considered as an efficient treatment within the armamentarium for resistant 
unipolar depression.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretrovirals have immensely increased the average life 
expectancy of HIV-positive patients. However, the incidence of QT interval 
prolongation and other arrhythmias has also increased.
METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature 
published between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: HIV-positive patients with high viral load, low CD4 
count, chronic inflammation, and autonomic neuropathy can develop QT interval 
prolongation. Another factor prolonging QT interval includes exposure to the HIV 
transactivator protein, which inhibits hERG K (+) channels controlling IKr K (+) 
currents in cardiomyocytes. Protease inhibitors inhibiting the CYP3A4 enzyme can 
also lead to QT interval prolongation. QT interval prolongation can potentially 
be exacerbated by opioids, antipsychotics, antibiotics, and antifungals, the 
adjunct medications often used in HIV-positive patients. Hepatic insufficiency 
in seropositive patients on antiretrovirals may also increase the risk of QT 
interval prolongation.
CONCLUSION: Baseline and follow-up EKG in the susceptible population is 
suggested.

OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a significant threat to 
patient and population health. The study aim was to develop and validate a model 
of AMR that defines and quantifies the value of new antibiotics.
METHODS: A dynamic disease transmission and cost-effectiveness model of AMR 
consisting of three components (disease transmission, treatment pathway and 
optimisation) was developed to evaluate the health economic value of new 
antibiotics. The model is based on the relationship between AMR, antimicrobial 
availability and consumption. Model analysis explored the impact of different 
antibiotic treatment strategies on the development of AMR, patient and 
population estimates of health benefit, across three common treatment 
indications and pathogens in the UK.
RESULTS: Population-level resistance to existing antimicrobials was estimated to 
increase from 10.3 to 16.1% over 10 years based on current antibiotic 
availability and consumption. In comparison, the diversified use of a new 
antibiotic was associated with significant reduction in AMR (12.8% vs. 16.1%) 
and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains at a patient (7.7-10.3, dependent on 
antimicrobial efficacy) and population level (3657-8197, dependent on 
antimicrobial efficacy and the prevalence of AMR). Validation across several 
real-world data sources showed that the model output does not tend to 
systematically under- or over-estimate observed data.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of new antibiotics and the appropriate use of 
existing antibiotics are key to addressing the threat of AMR. This study 
presents a validated model that quantifies the value of new antibiotics through 
clinical and economic outcomes of relevance, and accounts for disease 
transmission of infection and development of AMR. In this context, the model may 
be a useful tool that could contribute to the decision-making process alongside 
other potential models and expert advice.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the efficacy, tolerance, and 
cost-effectiveness of roxadustat treatment for anemia in patients with chronic 
kidney disease not receiving dialysis (CKD ND).
METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and 
tolerance of roxadustat for the correction of anemia associated with CKD ND, and 
a Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of roxadustat 
compared with a placebo.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis results showed that compared with a placebo, 
roxadustat treatment was associated with a remarkably higher rate of clinical 
response and the differences in the rate of adverse events between these two 
regimens were not significant. Moreover, roxadustat treatment (70 mg, three 
times per week) provided an additional 0.49 QALYs at a cost of $12,526 in the 
time horizon of 5 years, resulting in an ICER of $25,563 per QALY, with 
approximately 60% probability to be cost-effective at a $29,295 per QALY 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold from the perspective of Chinese medical 
system.
CONCLUSION: For the treatment of anemia in Chinese patients with CKD ND, 
roxadustat is much more effective than a placebo; moreover, it is cost-effective 
at conventional WTP thresholds.

Ain, United Arab Emirates.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common disease that has not only cutaneous 
manifestations but also causes significant systemic illness and disability. Most 
epidemiological studies on the burden of psoriasis that are available in 
literature are regional, and thus a detailed description of the worldwide burden 
of psoriasis is warranted.
METHODS: We analyzed the prevalence, incidence, disability adjusted life years 
(DALY), and years lived with disability (YLD) related to psoriasis for the 
period 1990 to 2017, from the Global Burden of Disease dataset (developed by the 
Institute of Health Metrics, University of Washington). We also searched the 
PubMed MEDLINE for quality of life and economic burden of psoriasis for a 
comprehensive evaluation of the burden of psoriasis.
RESULTS: In 2017, the global age-standardized prevalence rate of psoriasis was 
811 per 100,000 population, approximating to 0.84% of world population or about 
64.6 million individuals. The incidence of new cases increased from 92 per 
100,000 in 1990 to 99 in 2017. The highest rates were recorded in North America 
and Western Europe, while the lowest rates were found in Asia and Western 
Pacific regions. The age distribution shows a rising rate of incidence from the 
second decade, peaking at 55-60 years. Women are slightly more likely to be 
affected.
CONCLUSIONS: The global incidence of psoriasis has been rising over the last 
three decades. The burden of the economic and psychosocial suffering caused by 
psoriasis calls for resource allocation and a multidisciplinary approach to 
address this common medical condition.
KEY MESSAGE: The prevalence, incidence, and the burden of suffering caused by 
psoriasis have been rising over the past 17 years, despite efforts at improving 
diagnosis and treatment.

Since the introduction of the combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1 infection 
has become a manageable chronic disease in which patients display a life 
expectancy almost identical to the general population. Nevertheless, various 
age-related pathologies such as neurocognitive disorders have emerged as serious 
complications. A "shock and kill" strategy using latency-reversing agents (LRA) 
to reactivate HIV-1 has been proposed to eliminate the viral reservoir in such 
chronically infected patients. However, the impact of LRA on the central nervous 
system remains elusive. Given that an increased amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition is 
a feature of HIV-1-infected brains, we investigated the consequences of HIV-1 
infection and treatment with two LRA (bryostatin-1 and JQ1) on the capacity of 
human astrocytes to engulf and clear Aβ. We show here that HIV-1-infected 
astrocytes accumulate a very high amount of Aβ compared to uninfected cells, but 
the engulfed peptide in degraded very slowly. The LRA bryostatin-1 induces a 
reduction in Aβ endocytosis, whereas JQ1 treatment results in a very slow 
degradation of the ingested material associated with a reduced expression of the 
endopeptidase neprilysin. An exposure to JQ1 also induces a sustained release of 
Aβ-loaded microvesicles. Thus, both HIV-1 infection and treatment with some LRA 
could contribute to the reported Aβ accumulation in the brain of HIV-1-infected 
persons.

The objective of this study is to assess the global, regional, and national 
burden of bipolar disorder (BPD) from 1990 to 2017, by gender, age, and 
social-demographic index (SDI) from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study. We collected detailed information from GBD on the numbers of incidence 
cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized incidence 
rate (ASIR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) during 1990-2017. Estimated 
annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess ASIR and ASDR 
trends. GBD data estimated that BPD incidences increased by 47.74%, from 3.06 
million in 1990 to 4.53 million in 2017, and the DALYs increased by 54.4%, from 
6.02 million in 1990 to 9.29 million in 2017. Over the 28-year period between 
1990 and 2017, the ASIR and ASDR increased only slightly (EAPC = 0.14 and 0.05 
for ASIR and ASDR, respectively). Subjects aged 10-19 years contributed the most 
to the total number of incidence cases, while those aged 20-44 years contributed 
the most to the number of DALYs. The ASIR and ASDR were highest in tropical 
Latin America and lowest in East Asia. Areas in the lowest sociodemographic 
index (SDI) quintile showed the highest ASIR (about 64/100,000), and those in 
the highest SDI quintile showed the highest ASDR (about 140/100,000). In 
conclusion, while the ASIR and ASDR due to BPD have been stable, the absolute 
incidence and DALYs remain high, which represents an increasing burden on 
health-care systems.

Over the past decade, there have been accumulating reports from farmers and 
field extension personnel on the increasing incidence and spread of onion 
(Allium cepa) bulb basal rot in northern Israel. The disease is caused mainly by 
Fusarium species. Rotting onion bulbs were sampled from fields in the Golan 
Heights in northeastern Israel during the summers of 2017 and 2018. Tissue from 
the sampled onion bulbs was used for the isolation and identification of the 
infecting fungal species using colony and microscopic morphology 
characterization. Final confirmation of the pathogens was performed with PCR 
amplification and sequencing using fungi-specific and Fusarium species-specific 
primers. Four Fusarium spp. isolates were identified in onion bulbs samples 
collected from the contaminated field: F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum f. sp. 
cepae, and two species less familiar as causative agents of this disease, F. 
acutatum and F. anthophilium. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these species 
subdivided into two populations, a northern group isolated from white (Riverside 
cv.) onion bulbs, and a southern group isolated from red (565/505 cv.) bulbs. 
Pathogenicity tests conducted with seedlings and bulbs under moist conditions 
proved that all species could cause the disease symptoms, but with different 
degrees of virulence. Inoculating seeds with spore suspensions of the four 
species, in vitro, significantly reduced seedlings' germination rate, hypocotyl 
elongation, and fresh biomass. Mature onion bulbs infected with the fungal 
isolates produced typical rot symptoms 14 days post-inoculation, and the fungus 
from each infected bulb was re-isolated and identified to satisfy Koch's 
postulates. The onion bulb assay also reflected the degree of sensitivity of 
different onion cultivars to the disease. This work is the first confirmed 
report of the direct and primary cause of Fusarium onion basal rot disease in 
northeastern Israel. These findings are a necessary step towards uncovering the 
mycoflora of the diseased onion plants and developing a preventive program that 
would reduce the disease damage.

Background: Suicide is an important public health problem in the African 
continent whose economic burden remains largely unknown. This study estimated 
the monetary value of human lives lost due to suicide in the African continent 
in 2017. Methods: The human capital approach was applied to monetarily value the 
years of life lost due to premature mortality from suicide deaths (SD) among 54 
African countries. A 3% discount rate was used to convert future losses into 
their present values. The sensitivity of monetary value of human lives lost to 
changes in discount rate and average life expectancy was tested. Results: The 
75,505 human lives lost from suicide had a grand total monetary value of 
International Dollars (Int$) 6,989,963,325; and an average present value of Int$ 
92,576 per SD. About 31.1% of the total monetary value of SD was borne by 
high-income and upper-middle-income countries (Group 1); 54.4% by 
lower-middle-income countries (Group 2); and 14.5% by low-income countries 
(Group 3). The average monetary value per human life lost from SD was Int$ 
234,244 for Group 1, Int$ 109,545 for Group 2 and Int$ 32,223 for Group 3. 
Conclusions: Evidence shows that suicide imposes a substantive economic burden 
on African economies. The evidence reinforces the case for increased investments 
to ensure universal coverage of promotive, preventive, curative and 
rehabilitative mental health services.

BACKGROUND: Identifying molecular differences between primary and metastatic 
colorectal cancers-now possible with the aid of omics technologies-can improve 
our understanding of the biological mechanisms of cancer progression and 
facilitate the discovery of novel treatments for late-stage cancer. We compared 
the DNA methylomes of primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) and CRC metastases to 
the liver. Laser microdissection was used to obtain epithelial tissue (10 to 
25 × 106 μm2) from sections of fresh-frozen samples of primary CRCs (n = 6), CRC 
liver metastases (n = 12), and normal colon mucosa (n = 3). DNA extracted from 
tissues was enriched for methylated sequences with a methylCpG binding domain 
(MBD) polypeptide-based protocol and subjected to deep sequencing. The 
performance of this protocol was compared with that of targeted enrichment for 
bisulfite sequencing used in a previous study of ours.
RESULTS: MBD enrichment captured a total of 322,551 genomic regions (249.5 Mb or 
~ 7.8% of the human genome), which included over seven million CpG sites. A few 
of these regions were differentially methylated at an expected false discovery 
rate (FDR) of 5% in neoplastic tissues (primaries: 0.67%, i.e., 2155 regions 
containing 279,441 CpG sites; liver metastases: 1%, i.e., 3223 regions 
containing 312,723 CpG sites) as compared with normal mucosa samples. Most of 
the differentially methylated regions (DMRs; 94% in primaries; 70% in 
metastases) were hypermethylated, and almost 80% of these (1882 of 2396) were 
present in both lesion types. At 5% FDR, no DMRs were detected in liver 
metastases vs. primary CRC. However, short regions of low-magnitude 
hypomethylation were frequent in metastases but rare in primaries. 
Hypermethylated DMRs were far more abundant in sequences classified as 
intragenic, gene-regulatory, or CpG shelves-shores-island segments, whereas 
hypomethylated DMRs were equally represented in extragenic (mainly, open-sea) 
and intragenic (mainly, gene bodies) sequences of the genome. Compared with 
targeted enrichment, MBD capture provided a better picture of the extension of 
CRC-associated DNA hypermethylation but was less powerful for identifying 
hypomethylation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the hypermethylation phenotype in CRC 
liver metastases remains similar to that of the primary tumor, whereas 
CRC-associated DNA hypomethylation probably undergoes further progression after 
the cancer cells have migrated to the liver.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes and cost effectiveness of two alternate 
policy strategies for prenatal care among low-income, immigrant women: coverage 
for delivery only (the federal standard) and prenatal care with delivery 
coverage (state option under the Children's Health Insurance Program).
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to determine the cost 
effectiveness of two alternate policies for pregnancy coverage. All states 
currently provide coverage for delivery, and 19 states also provide coverage for 
prenatal care. An estimated 84,000 unauthorized immigrant women have pregnancies 
where no prenatal care is covered. Our outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years, and cases of cerebral palsy and infant death before age 1. Model 
inputs were obtained from a database of Oregon Medicaid claims and the 
literature. Univariate and bivariate sensitivity analyses, as well as a Monte 
Carlo simulation, were performed.
RESULTS: Extending prenatal coverage is a cost-effective strategy. Providing 
prenatal care for the 84,000 women annually who are currently uninsured could 
prevent 117 infant deaths and 34 cases of cerebral palsy. Prenatal care coverage 
costs $380 more per woman than covering the delivery only. For every 865 
additional women receiving prenatal care, one infant death would be averted, at 
an average cost of $328,700. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analyses 
suggest a 99% probability that providing prenatal care is more cost effective at 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: Extending prenatal care to low-income, immigrant women, regardless 
of citizenship status, is a cost-effective strategy.

INTRODUCTION: There has been a phenomenal worldwide increase in the development 
and use of mobile health applications (mHealth apps) that monitor menstruation 
and fertility. Critics argue that many of the apps are inaccurate and lack 
evidence from either clinical trials or user experience. The aim of this scoping 
review is to provide an overview of the research literature on mHealth apps that 
track menstruation and fertility.
METHODS: This project followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The 
ACM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for 
material published between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2019. Data summary and 
synthesis were used to chart and analyse the data.
RESULTS: In total 654 records were reviewed. Subsequently, 135 duplicate records 
and 501 records that did not meet the inclusion criteria were removed. Eighteen 
records from 13 countries form the basis of this review. The papers reviewed 
cover a variety of disciplinary and methodological frameworks. Three main themes 
were identified: fertility and reproductive health tracking, pregnancy planning, 
and pregnancy prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: Motivations for fertility app use are varied, overlap and change 
over time, although women want apps that are accurate and evidence-based 
regardless of whether they are tracking their fertility, planning a pregnancy or 
using the app as a form of contraception. There is a lack of critical debate and 
engagement in the development, evaluation, usage and regulation of fertility and 
menstruation apps. The paucity of evidence-based research and absence of 
fertility, health professionals and users in studies is raised.

Maximal strength training (MST) results in robust improvements in skeletal 
muscle force production, efficiency, and mass. However, the effects of MST on 
muscle mitochondria are still unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this study 
was to examine, from the molecular level to whole-muscle, mitochondrial 
adaptations induced by 8 weeks of knee-extension MST in the quadriceps of 10 
older adults using immunoblotting, spectrophotometry, high-resolution 
respirometry in permeabilized muscle fibers, in vivo 31P magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (31P-MRS), and gas exchange. As anticipated, MST resulted in an 
increased isometric knee-extensor force from 133 ± 36 to 147 ± 49 Nm (p < .05) 
and quadriceps muscle volume from 1,410 ± 103 to 1,555 ± 455 cm3 (p < .05). 
Mitochondrial complex (I-V) protein abundance and citrate synthase activity were 
not significantly altered by MST. Assessed ex vivo, maximal ADP-stimulated 
respiration (state 3CI+CII, PRE: 23 ± 6 and POST: 14 ± 5 ρM·mg-1·s-1, p < .05), 
was decreased by MST, predominantly, as a result of a decline in complex 
I-linked respiration (p < .05). Additionally, state 3 free-fatty acid linked 
respiration was decreased following MST (PRE: 19 ± 5 and POST: 14 ± 3 
ρM·mg-1·s-1, p < .05). Assessed in vivo, MST slowed the PCr recovery time 
constant (PRE: 49 ± 13 and POST: 57 ± 16 seconds, p < .05) and lowered, by ~20% 
(p = .055), the quadriceps peak rate of oxidative ATP synthesis, but did not 
significantly alter the oxidation of lipid. Although these, likely qualitative, 
mitochondrial adaptations are potentially negative in terms of skeletal muscle 
energetic capacity, they need to be considered in light of the many improvements 
in muscle function that MST affords older adults.

In the last decades, new technologies have improved the survival of patients 
affected by chronic illnesses. Among them, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) 
has represented a viable solution for patients with advanced heart failure (HF). 
Even though the LVAD prolongs life expectancy, patients' vulnerability generally 
increases during follow up and patients' request for the device withdrawal might 
occur. Such a request raises some ethical concerns in that it directly hastens 
the patient's death. Hence, in order to assess the ethical acceptability of LVAD 
withdrawal, we analyse and examine an ethical argument, widely adopted in the 
literature, that we call the "descriptive approach", which consists in giving a 
definition of life-sustaining treatment to evaluate the ethical acceptability of 
treatment withdrawal. Focusing attention on LVAD, we show criticisms of this 
perspective. Finally, we assess every patient's request of LVAD withdrawal 
through a prescriptive approach, which finds its roots in the criterion of 
proportionality.

Heritability of human lifespan is 23-33% as evident from twin studies. 
Genome-wide association studies explored this question by linking particular 
alleles to lifespan traits. However, genetic variants identified so far can 
explain only a small fraction of lifespan heritability in humans. Here, we 
report that the burden of rarest protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in two large 
cohorts is negatively associated with human healthspan and lifespan, accounting 
for 0.4 and 1.3 years of their variability, respectively. In addition, 
longer-living individuals possess both fewer rarest PTVs and less damaging PTVs. 
We further estimated that somatic accumulation of PTVs accounts for only a small 
fraction of mortality and morbidity acceleration and hence is unlikely to be 
causal in aging. We conclude that rare damaging mutations, both inherited and 
accumulated throughout life, contribute to the aging process, and that burden of 
ultra-rare variants in combination with common alleles better explain apparent 
heritability of human lifespan.

Plain Language Summary: Most living things undergo biological changes as they 
get older, a process that we generally refer to as aging. Despite being a 
widespread phenomenon, scientists do not fully understand why we age, though it 
appears that a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors, such as diet, play 
a role in influencing lifespan. Aging increases the risk of developing a wide 
range of diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes. As such, 
finding ways to slow the aging process would help to postpone the onset of 
illness and potentially improve health in old age. Genes are thought to be 
responsible for between one quarter and one third of the variation in human 
lifespans. The relationship between genes, aging and lifespan is complex and not 
well understood. One set of rare genetic changes that have been shown to have 
significant effects on diseases are called protein truncation variants (PTVs). 
PTVs cause damage by altering the production of certain proteins. There are many 
possible PTVs and people can be born with them or they can develop them in some 
cells later in life. The full influence of PTVs on aging is not known. 
Shindyapina, Zenin et al. have now studied observational data collected from two 
groups of over 40,000 people in the UK. Both groups recorded over 1,000 deaths, 
and the study examined the influence of PTVs on natural lifespan. The results 
show that each person is born with an average of six PTVs, which can vary in the 
impact that they have on aging. Having more, or more severe, PTVs could reduce 
life expectancy on average by 1.3 years. PTVs affect both total lifespan and 
healthy lifespan, the period of time lived prior to developing the first 
age-related disease. While PTVs that people are born with have a significant 
effect on aging, this study also showed that PTVs that are acquired due to 
spontaneous mutations through a person’s life have much less of an impact. This 
is a key insight into the relationship between genes and aging. These 
discoveries could help in using genetics to anticipate future health, it also 
helps to identify some of the biological systems that have a role in aging. This 
could lead to new ways to delay the aging process and its effects on health.

Although not yet developed in Europe, second-use of traction batteries enables 
an extension of their lifetime and potentially improves life cycle environmental 
performance. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) offer the most promising chemistry for 
traction batteries in electric vehicles (xEVs) and for second-use. Due to the 
novelty of the topic and the expected increase of e-mobility in the next 
decades, more efforts to understand the potential consequences of second-use of 
batteries from different perspectives are needed. This paper develops a dynamic, 
parameterised Material Flow Analysis (MFA) model to estimate stocks and flows of 
LIBs after their removal from xEVs along the specific processes of the european 
value-chain. Direct reuse, second-use and recycling are included in the model 
and parameters make it customisable and updatable. Focusing on full and plug-in 
electric vehicles, LIBs and energy storage capacity flows are estimated. Stocks 
and flows of two embedded materials relevant for Europe were also assessed 
(cobalt and lithium). Results showed that second-use corresponds to a better 
exploitation of LIBs' storage capacity. Meanwhile, Co and Li in-use stocks are 
locked in LIBs and their recovery is delayed by second-use; depending on the 
slower/faster development of second-use, the amount of Co available for 
recycling in 2030 ranges between 9% and 15% of Co demand and between 7 and 16% 
for Li. Uncertainty of inputs is addressed through sensitivity analysis. A 
variety of actors can use this MFA model to enhance knowledge of second-use of 
batteries in Europe and to support the effective management of LIBs along their 
value-chain.

The inhalation of particulate matter (PM) is a significant health risk 
associated with reduced life expectancy due to increased cardio-pulmonary 
disease and exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and pneumonia. 
PM originates from natural and anthropogenic sources including combustion 
engines, cigarettes, agricultural burning, and forest fires. Identifying the 
source of PM can inform effective mitigation strategies and policies, but this 
is difficult to do using current techniques. Here we present a method for 
identifying PM source using excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence 
spectroscopy and a machine learning algorithm. We collected combustion generated 
PM2.5 from wood burning, diesel exhaust, and cigarettes using filters. Filters 
were weighted to determine mass concentration followed by extraction into 
cyclohexane and analysis by EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectra obtained from 
each source served as training data for a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
used for source identification in mixed samples. This method can predict the 
presence or absence of the three laboratory sources with an overall accuracy of 
89% when the threshold for classifying a source as present is 1.1 μg/m3 in air 
over a 24-hour sampling time. The limit of detection for cigarette, diesel and 
wood are 0.7, 2.6, 0.9 μg/m3, respectively, in air assuming a 24-hour sampling 
time at an air sampling rate of 1.8 liters per minute. We applied the CNN 
algorithm developed using the laboratory training data to a small set of field 
samples and found the algorithm was effective in some cases but would require a 
training data set containing more samples to be more broadly applicable.

The Measure of Population Aging in Different Welfare Regimes: A Bayesian Dynamic 
Modeling Approach.

Given a population at a specific time point, it is often of interest to identify 
the entry age into typical stages of life, such as being young, becoming adult 
and elderly. These age cutoffs are important because they influence the public 
opinion and have an impact on policy decisions. An issue of great social 
relevance is defining the threshold beyond which a person becomes elderly. Fixed 
cutoffs are debatable because of their conventional nature which disregards 
issues such as changing life expectancy and the evolving structure of the age 
distribution. The above shortcomings can be overcome if age cutoffs are defined 
endogenously, i.e., relative to the whole age distribution of each country at a 
specific time point. We pursue this line of research by presenting an analysis 
whose main features are: (1) establishing a relationship between a country's 
welfare regime and its age distribution and aging process, together with the 
identification of four clusters of countries corresponding to distinctive 
welfare models and (2) a Bayesian hierarchical dynamic model which accounts for 
the uncertainty in the time series of measurements of the endogenous cutoffs for 
the countries in the sample, as well as for their clustering structure. Our 
analysis leads to model-based estimates of country-specific endogenous age 
cutoffs and corresponding aging indicators. Additionally, we provide 
cluster-specific estimates, a novel contribution engendered by the use of 
hierarchical modeling, which widens the scope of our analysis beyond the 
countries which are present in the sample.

Graduated Controlled Atmosphere: A Novel Approach to Increase "Duke" Blueberry 
Storage Life.

Blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) are highly valued for their 
health-promoting potential, yet they are extremely perishable. Controlled 
atmosphere (CA) strategies reduce blueberry respiratory metabolism, slowing down 
senescence. However, the sudden change of atmosphere could elicit a physical 
abiotic stress in the fruit, negatively affecting quality. We propose an 
innovative approach based on controlled graduation to slowly reach optimum gas 
storage conditions as an alternative to standard CA. For two consecutive 
seasons, "Duke" blueberries were subjected to four different storage conditions: 
control (air); standard CA (sudden exposure to 5 kPa O2 and 10 kPa CO2 across 
the experiment); GCA3 and GCA7 (gradually reaching 5 kPa O2 and 10 kPa CO2 in 3 
and 7 days, respectively). Fruit were stored for 28 days at 0 ± 0.5°C. Real-time 
respirometry provided an in-depth insight to the respiratory response of 
blueberries to their gas environment. Blueberries subjected to the graduated 
application of CA (GCA) treatments had a lower steady-state respiration rate 
compared to control and standard CA fruit. This indicated a reduction in 
metabolic activity that positively impacted quality and storage life extension. 
For example, GCA3 and GCA7 blueberries had a 25% longer storage life when 
compared to control, based on reduced decay incidence. In addition, GCA fruit 
were 27% firmer than control and CA fruit after 28 days of cold storage. GCA3 
had a positive effect on maintaining individual sugars concentrations throughout 
the experiment, and both GCA treatments maintained ascorbic acid content close
