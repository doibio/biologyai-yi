adjusted life years value was 0.53 on a scale of 0 to 1. The response rate was 
41.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness in our participants was more common than Hamilton and 
Canadian rates. Frequent EMS callers had higher rates of poverty and food 
insecurity than average Ontario citizens, which may also act as a barrier to 
accessing preventative health services. Lower quality of life may indicate 
chronic illness, and users who cannot access ambulatory care services 
consistently may call EMS more frequently. Frequent callers of EMS had high 
rates of social loneliness and poverty, and low quality of life, indicating a 
need for health service optimization for this vulnerable population.

AIMS: Among all malignancies, the use of radiotherapy incurs the highest 
survival benefit within cervical cancers. Radiotherapy, however, remains 
underutilised for cervical cancers within the Brazilian public health system 
(BPHS). The objective of this study was to estimate the potential health and 
monetary benefits for universal access to radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy 
(CRT) for untreated cervical cancer patients in the BPHS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 2016 data on Brazilian cervical cancer incidence 
and availability of radiotherapy/CRT in the BPHS, the number of cancer deaths 
due to radiotherapy/CRT underutilisation was estimated. The incremental 
effectiveness was calculated by life-year gain. The indirect costs from 
mortality-related productivity loss (MRPL) were estimated based on life 
expectancy, wage and labour force participation rate. MRPL was compared with 
direct medical costs after being adjusted to 2016 US dollars. This study was 
conducted from the payer's perspective; both costs and effectiveness were 
discounted at a rate of 3%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
calculated to determine the cost-effectiveness of radiotherapy for cervical 
cancer in Brazil. One-way sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the 
robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The total number of life-years lost due to lack of universal access to 
radiotherapy and CRT per year were 27 199 and 31 627, respectively. The annual 
cost to match the radiotherapy gap was $10.5 million, with an additional cost of 
$3 million to close the CRT gap. The mean years of potential life lost per death 
was 20.5. The cost per life saved was $7942 for radiotherapy alone (ICER 
$388/life-year) and $8774 for CRT (ICER $429/life-year). MRPL due to shortage of 
radiotherapy and CRT were $59 million and $69 million, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Providing universal access to radiotherapy/CRT for cervical cancer 
patients in the BPHS is highly cost-effective and should be prioritised as an 
impactful public health initiative.

BACKGROUND: Fourth-generation ceramic-on-ceramic couplings were developed to 
improve ceramic toughness and strength. Encouraging outcomes in primary total 
hip arthroplasty were reported. This coupling was proposed as an attractive 
option even in the case of revision procedures, particularly in younger patients 
with a longer life expectancy. However, the pertinent literature is scarce. 
Thus, a registry study was conducted to investigate the midterm survival rates 
and reasons for re-revision of the fourth-generation ceramic-on-ceramic bearing 
surfaces in revision hip arthroplasties.
METHODS: A total of 327 revision implants (all the components were exchanged) 
with BIOLOX Delta couplings were investigated using the regional orthopedic 
registry RIPO. The demographics, the survival rates, and the reasons for 
re-revision were assessed. Revisions with bearings other than Delta were 
compared.
RESULTS: Delta bearings achieved a survival rate of 90.5% at 7 years, with 
stable results. Twenty-six (8%) re-revisions occurred at a mean follow-up of 4.1 
years. And 2.8% of the re-revisions were due to recurrent dislocations; 1.5% of 
the cases were due to cup aseptic loosening. Septic loosening occurred in 1.6% 
of the cases. No ceramic fractures were reported. When compared to revisions 
with bearings other than Delta-on-Delta, Delta coupling cohort achieved similar 
performances at 5 and 7 years. Lower, nonsignificant rates of aseptic and septic 
loosening were reported in Delta cohort.
CONCLUSION: Delta-on-Delta couplings demonstrated to be reliable bearing 
surfaces in revision settings at a midterm follow-up. Clinical studies and 
longer follow-ups are required to investigate potential adverse effects, like 
squeaking and fractures, and confirm these preliminary findings.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

BACKGROUND: Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma that 
is unresponsive to chemotherapy. Cediranib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, has 
shown substantial activity in ASPS in non-randomised studies. The Cediranib in 
Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (CASPS) study was designed to discriminate the effect 
of cediranib from the intrinsically indolent nature of ASPS.
METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial, we 
recruited participants from 12 hospitals in the UK (n=7), Spain (n=3), and 
Australia (n=2). Patients were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older; 
metastatic ASPS that had progressed in the previous 6 months; had an ECOG 
performance status of 0-1; life expectancy of more than 12 weeks; and adequate 
bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Participants had to have no 
anti-cancer treatment within 4 weeks before trial entry, with exception of 
palliative radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1), with 
allocation by use of computer-generated random permuted blocks of six, to either 
cediranib (30 mg orally, once daily) or matching placebo tablets for 24 weeks. 
Treatment was supplied in number-coded bottles, masking participants and 
clinicians to assignment. Participants were unblinded at week 24 or sooner if 
they had progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(version 1.1); those on placebo crossed over to cediranib and all participants 
continued on treatment until progression or death. The primary endpoint was 
percentage change in sum of target marker lesion diameters between baseline and 
week 24 or progression if sooner, assessed in the evaluable population (all 
randomly assigned participants who had a scan at week 24 [or sooner if they 
progressed] with target marker lesions measured). Safety was assessed in all 
participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01337401; the European Clinical 
Trials database, number EudraCT2010-021163-33; and the ISRCTN registry, number 
ISRCTN63733470 recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between July 15, 2011, and July 29, 2016, of 48 participants 
recruited, all were randomly assigned to cediranib (n=32) or placebo (n=16). 23 
(48%) were female and the median age was 31 years (IQR 27-45). Median follow-up 
was 34·3 months (IQR 23·7-55·6) at the time of data cutoff for these analyses 
(April 11, 2018). Four participants in the cediranib group were not evaluable 
for the primary endpoint (one did not start treatment, and three did not have 
their scan at 24 weeks). Median percentage change in sum of target marker lesion 
diameters for the evaluable population was -8·3% (IQR -26·5 to 5·9) with 
cediranib versus 13·4% (IQR 1·1 to 21·3) with placebo (one-sided p=0·0010). The 
most common grade 3 adverse events on (blinded) cediranib were hypertension (six 
[19%] of 31) and diarrhoea (two [6%]). 15 serious adverse reactions in 12 
patients were reported; 12 of these reactions occurred on open-label cediranib, 
and the most common symptoms were dehydration (n=2), vomiting (n=2), and 
proteinuria (n=2). One probable treatment-related death (intracranial 
haemorrhage) occurred 41 days after starting open-label cediranib in a patient 
who was assigned to placebo in the masked phase.
INTERPRETATION: Given the high incidence of metastatic disease and poor 
long-term prognosis of ASPS, together with the lack of efficacy of conventional 
chemotherapy, our finding of significant clinical activity with cediranib in 
this disease is an important step towards the goal of long-term disease control 
for these young patients. Future clinical trials in ASPS are also likely to 
involve immune checkpoint inhibitors.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the quality of drug treatment in older people from a 
broad family physician perspective, and to provide evidence for power 
calculations in full-scale studies on prescribing quality.
DESIGN: Descriptive, retrospective pilot study.
SETTING: A primary healthcare centre in Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: 123 consecutive patients, ≥65 years, with a non-urgent physician 
consultation in January 2016.
MEASURES: The drug treatment was assessed by a physician as either appropriate 
or suboptimal, taking individual factors like morbidity, life expectancy and 
concurrent drug treatment into account, and preceded by the application of 493 
criteria from three screening tools for Potentially Inappropriate Medications 
(PIMs) and Potential Prescribing Omissions (PPOs). Suboptimal drug treatment was 
further categorised regarding priority: (1) immediate change suggested or (2) 
actions suggested in the longer term. Prevalence of the procedure code 
'medication review' and the results thereof were also recorded.
RESULTS: Median age: 76 years; 48% women. When a family physician perspective 
was applied, and 593 PIMs/PPOs identified in 117 (95%) patients considered, 45 
(37%) patients had suboptimal drug treatment. Immediate handling was suggested 
in 13 (11%) patients, most often concerning withdrawals of drugs for anxiety and 
insomnia. Handling in the longer term was suggested in 32 (26%) patients, most 
often concerning overuse of proton pump inhibitors. Over the last year, the 
procedure code 'medication review' was recorded for 65 (53%) patients. In 
medication reviews recorded during January 2016 (n=45), 23 (7%) drugs out of 309 
were acted on, most often a dosage adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that when a broad family physician 
perspective is applied, taking individual factors and medical priorities in the 
complex clinical situation into account, drug treatment in primary care is 
appropriate for the majority of older patients. The results may be useful in 
sample size considerations for future studies on prescribing practices.

Telomeres are repeated sequences found at the end of the linear chromosomes of 
most eukaryotes and are required for chromosome integrity. Expression of the 
reverse-transcriptase telomerase allows for extension of telomeric repeats to 
counteract natural telomere shortening. Although Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a 
photosynthetic unicellular green alga, is widely used as a model organism in 
photosynthesis and flagella research, and for biotechnological applications, the 
biology of its telomeres has not been investigated in depth. Here, we show that 
the C. reinhardtii (TTTTAGGG)n telomeric repeats are mostly nondegenerate and 
that the telomeres form a protective structure, with a subset ending with a 3' 
overhang and another subset presenting a blunt end. Although telomere size and 
length distributions are stable under various standard growth conditions, they 
vary substantially between 12 genetically close reference strains. Finally, we 
identify CrTERT, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase and show 
that telomeres shorten progressively in mutants of this gene. Telomerase mutants 
eventually enter replicative senescence, demonstrating that telomerase is 
required for long-term maintenance of telomeres in C. reinhardtii.

We use the genotyping and death register information of 409,693 individuals of 
British ancestry to investigate fitness effects of the CCR5-∆32 mutation. We 
estimate a 21% increase in the all-cause mortality rate in individuals who are 
homozygous for the ∆32 allele. A deleterious effect of the ∆32/∆32 mutation is 
also independently supported by a significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium (HWE) due to a deficiency of ∆32/∆32 individuals at the time of 
recruitment.

The ability of the agent of plague, Yersinia pestis, to form a biofilm blocking 
the gut of the flea has been considered to be a key evolutionary step in 
maintaining flea-borne transmission. However, blockage decreases dramatically 
the life expectancy of fleas, challenging the adaptive nature of blockage. Here, 
we develop an epidemiological model of plague that accounts for its different 
transmission routes, as well as the within-host competition taking place between 
bacteria within the flea vector. We use this theoretical framework to identify 
the environmental conditions promoting the evolution of blockage. We also show 
that blockage is favored at the onset of an epidemic, and that the frequencies 
of bacterial strains exhibiting different strategies of blockage can fluctuate 
in seasonal environments. This analysis quantifies the contribution of different 
transmission routes in plague and makes testable predictions on the adaptive 
nature of blockage.

BACKGROUND: Mapping algorithms have been indicated as a second-best solution for 
estimating health state utilities for the calculation of quality-adjusted 
life-years within cost-utility analysis when no generic preference-based measure 
is incorporated into the study. However, the predictive performance of these 
algorithms may be variable and hence it is important to assess their external 
validity before application in different settings.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the external validity and 
generalisability of existing mapping algorithms for predicting preference-based 
Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) utilities from non-preference-based Pediatric 
Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) scores among children and adolescents living 
with or without disabilities or health conditions.
METHODS: Five existing mapping algorithms, three developed using data from an 
Australian community population and two using data from a UK population with one 
or more self-reported health conditions, were externally validated on data from 
the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 6623). The predictive 
accuracy of each mapping algorithm was assessed using the mean absolute error 
(MAE) and the mean squared error (MSE).
RESULTS: Values for the MAE (0.0741-0.2302) for all validations were within the 
range of published estimates. In general, across all ages, the algorithms 
amongst children and adolescents with disabilities/health conditions (Australia 
MAE: 0.2085-0.2302; UK MAE: 0.0854-0.1162) performed worse relative to those 
amongst children and adolescents without disabilities/health conditions 
(Australia MAE: 0.1424-0.1645; UK MAE: 0.0741-0.0931).
CONCLUSIONS: The published mapping algorithms have acceptable predictive 
accuracy as measured by MAE and MSE. The findings of this study indicate that 
the choice of the most appropriate mapping algorithm to apply may vary according 
to the population under consideration.

OBJECTIVE: Cost-utility analyses are becoming increasingly important in Central 
and Eastern Europe. We aimed to develop a Polish utility tariff for EQ-5D-5L 
health states.
METHODS: Face-to-face, computer-assisted interviews were collected in a 
representative sample. Each respondent followed a standardised protocol to 
collect ten composite time trade-off and seven discrete choice experiment 
observations. In the Bayesian approach, several model specifications were 
compared based on model fit, the usability of the final value set and how they 
reflect the elicitation procedure (e.g. censoring). A hybrid approach (using 
composite time trade-off and discrete choice experiment data) was employed in 
the final set, which was compared with the existing ones: EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L 
cross-walk.
RESULTS: Data from 1252 respondents (11,480 composite time trade-off valuations 
and 8764 discrete choice experiment pairs) were collected over the period June 
to October 2016. The final model accounted for random parameters, error scaling 
with fat tails, censoring at - 1, unwillingness to trade in time trade-off by 
the religious people and Cauchy distribution in discrete choice experiments. 
Pain/discomfort impacts the utility most: the disutility equals 0.575 when at 
level 5. In the value set, 4.4% of EQ-5D-5L states are worse than dead. The new 
value set has a comparable range (minimum of - 0.590 compared to - 0.523) and 
the same ordering of the first three dimensions (pain/discomfort, mobility, 
self-care) as the EQ-5D-3L value set and the EQ-5D-5L cross-walk value set. 
Moreover, it is more sensitive to a moderate decline in health.
CONCLUSIONS: The new value set supports consistency with past decisions in 
cost-utility studies, while offering a better assessment of even moderate 
improvements in health. It could represent an option for Central and Eastern 
Europe countries lacking their own value sets.

This study analyzed the cost utility on the use of 
ixazomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (IRD), lenalidomide/dexamethasone (RD), 
bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone (VTD), or bortezomib/dexamethasone (VD) for 
patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (rrMM). Patients' lifelong 
direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are simulated by 
using the Markov model on the basis of the China's healthcare system. VTD, RD, 
and IRD are 0.12, 0.32, and 0.42 QALYs higher than VD, and $9401, $16,868, and 
$39,671 higher than those of VD in terms of lifelong cost. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios are 78,342, 52,713, and 94,455, respectively. IRD can 
extend the life years of patients with rrMM, improve the quality of life, and 
increase the cost of medical treatment. The use of VD has a comparative 
advantage of cost utility. For patients who cannot tolerate bortezomib or were 
drug-fast with first-line bortezomib, RD plan is another economical and 
effective strategy.

Quantifying socioeconomic inequalities in health in absolute terms is of prime 
interest for decision-making and for international comparisons. The Slope Index 
of Inequality (SII), an index that quantifies absolute socioeconomic 
inequalities, was recently formalized, particularly in the context of mortality 
differences measured in the rate or hazard scale. However, absolute inequalities 
using either rates or hazards do not translate into a time dimension, which 
makes their interpretation difficult for policymakers. We propose an extension 
of the (Equation is included in full-text article.)in terms of the expected 
number of life years lost before an upper age, as well as its decomposition by 
cause of death. The (Equation is included in full-text article.)in the life 
years lost metric quantifies the extent to which life expectancy is shortened 
when comparing the higher and lower ends of the socioeconomic scale. The 
methodology proposed builds on recent developments in survival analysis for 
decomposing the number of life years lost according to cause of death using a 
pseudo-value approach. We illustrate our proposal using a representative 1% 
sample of the French population. On average, the least educated men lost 7 years 
of life from age 30 up to age 90 compared to the most educated. The loss for 
women is twice as much with 3.5 years. The (Equation is included in full-text 
article.)in the life years lost metric is easily understood, and the 
decomposition of the all-cause mortality (Equation is included in full-text 
article.)into parts attributable to given causes provides a sound estimation of 
the burden of different causes of death on absolute socioeconomic inequalities 
in mortality.

Inequality, Education, Workforce Preparedness, and Complex Problem Solving.

Kyllonen PC(1).

Author information:
(1)Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ 08648, USA. pkyllonen@ets.org.

Economic inequality has been described as the defining challenge of our time, 
responsible for a host of potential negative societal and individual outcomes 
including reduced opportunity, decreased health and life expectancy, and the 
destabilization of democracy. Education has been proposed as the "great 
equalizer" that has and can continue to play a role in reducing inequality. One 
means by which education does so is through the development of complex problem 
solving skills in students, skills used to solve novel, ill-defined problems in 
complex, real-world settings. These are highly valued in the workforce and will 
likely continue to be so in the future workforce. Their importance is evident in 
results from employer surveys, as well as by their inclusion in large scale 
international and domestic comparative assessments. In this paper, I review 
various definitions of complex problem solving and approaches for measuring it, 
along with findings from PISA 2003, 2012, and 2015. I also discuss prospects for 
teaching, assessing, and reporting on it, and discuss the emerging importance of 
collaborative problem solving. Developing and monitoring complex problem solving 
skills, broadly defined, is a critical challenge in preparing students for the 
future workforce, and in overcoming the negative effects of inequality and the 
diminishment of individual opportunity.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if dose de-escalation from 
60 to 66 Gy to 30 to 36 Gy of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for selected patients 
with human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma could 
maintain historical rates for disease control while reducing toxicity and 
preserving swallow function and quality of life (QOL).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: MC1273 was a single-arm phase II trial testing an 
aggressive course of RT de-escalation after surgery. Eligibility criteria 
included patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, 
smoking history of 10 pack-years or less, and negative margins. Cohort A 
(intermediate risk) received 30 Gy delivered in 1.5-Gy fractions twice per day 
over 2 weeks along with 15 mg/m2 docetaxel once per week. Cohort B included 
patients with extranodal extension who received the same treatment plus a 
simultaneous integrated boost to nodal levels with extranodal extension to 36 Gy 
in 1.8-Gy fractions twice per day. The primary end point was locoregional tumor 
control at 2 years. Secondary end points included 2-year progression-free 
survival, overall survival, toxicity, swallow function, and patient-reported 
QOL.
RESULTS: Accrual was from September 2013 to June 2016 (N = 80; cohort A, n = 37; 
cohort B, n = 43). Median follow-up was 36 months, with a minimum follow-up of 
25 months. The 2-year locoregional tumor control rate was 96.2%, with 
progression-free survival of 91.1% and overall survival of 98.7%. Rates of grade 
3 or worse toxicity at pre-RT and 1 and 2 years post-RT were 2.5%, 0%, and 0%. 
Swallowing function improved slightly between pre-RT and 12 months post-RT, with 
one patient requiring temporary feeding tube placement.
CONCLUSION: Aggressive RT de-escalation resulted in locoregional tumor control 
rates comparable to historical controls, low toxicity, and little decrement in 
swallowing function or QOL.

BACKGROUND: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure entails large health 
effects in many urban areas. Public measures aiming at decreasing air pollution 
are often designed without targeting an explicit health benefit. Our objective 
was to investigate the health and economic benefits and the social inequalities 
in exposure resulting from several scenarios of reduction of PM2.5 exposure, in 
order to support decisions about urban policies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the French conurbations of Grenoble and Lyon (0.4 and 
1.4 million inhabitants, respectively), PM2.5 yearly average exposure was 
estimated on a 10-m grid by coupling a PM2.5 dispersion model to population 
density. Changes in death cases, life expectancy, lung cancer and term low birth 
weight incident cases as well as associated health economic costs were estimated 
for ten PM2.5 reduction scenarios differing in terms of amplitude of reduction 
and spatial extent. Changes in social differences in PM2.5 exposure were also 
assessed.
RESULTS: During the 2015-2017 period, PM2.5 average exposure was 13.9 μg/m3 in 
Grenoble and 15.3 μg/m3 in Lyon conurbations. Exposure to PM2.5 led to an 
estimated 145 (95% Confidence Interval, CI, 90-199) and 531 (95% CI, 330-729) 
premature deaths, 16 (95% CI, 8-24) and 65 (95% CI, 30-96) incident lung 
cancers, and 49 (95% CI, 19-76) and 193 (95% CI, 76-295) term low birth weight 
cases each year in Grenoble and Lyon conurbations, respectively, compared to a 
situation without PM2.5 anthropogenic sources, i.e. a PM2.5 concentration of 
4.9 μg/m3. The associated costs amounted to 495 (Grenoble) and 1767 (Lyon) 
M€/year for the intangible costs related to all-cause non-accidental mortality 
and 27 and 105 M€ for the tangible and intangible costs induced by lung cancer. 
A PM2.5 exposure reduction down to the WHO air quality guideline (10 μg/m3) 
would reduce anthropogenic PM2.5-attributable mortality by half while decreases 
by 2.9 μg/m3 (Grenoble) and 3.3 μg/m3 (Lyon) were required to reduce it by a 
third. Scenarios focusing only on the most exposed areas had little overall 
impact. Scenarios seeking to reach a homogeneous exposure in the whole study 
area were the most efficient in alleviating social inequalities in exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction scenarios targeting only air pollution hotspots had 
little expected impact on population health. We provided estimates of the PM2.5 
change required to reduce PM2.5-attributable mortality by one third or more. Our 
approach can help targeting air pollution reduction scenarios expected to entail 
significant benefits, and it could easily be transposed to other urban areas.

INTRODUCTION: Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) technique is a less invasive 
approach for radical cystectomy (RC), which is promising in reducing the 
incisional morbidity and improving the cosmesis of laparoscopic surgery. This 
study aimed to investigate the clinical and oncological outcomes for patients 
with malignant urinary bladder tumors that underwent the transurethral-assisted 
transumbilical LESS-RC.
METHODS: From December 2014 to June 2017, 47 patients underwent LESS-RC combined 
with unilateral or bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy were enrolled in this study. 
The urethra was used as a potential approach without additional incision, which 
could allow for trocar insertion through natural orifices. Assessments were also 
conducted on preoperative, perioperative, postoperative, pathologic, and 
functional outcome data.
RESULTS: Mean patient age was 73 years. Mean body mass index was 24.0 kg/m2. 
Median operating time and estimated blood loss measure 217 min and 178 mL, 
respectively. Four patients were diagnosed with positive lymph nodes. Two 
patients had positive surgical margins. No major perioperative complications 
occurred. Median postoperative follow-up time was 20.1 months. Two patients died 
due to their progressive disease.
CONCLUSION: LESS can serve as a feasible and effective surgical procedure for RC 
to treat bladder cancer. With increasing experience and improvements, LESS-RC is 
promising to be a relatively acceptable alternative for minimally invasive 
surgery in some specific patients (with generally poor conditions that cannot be 
tolerated for a long time surgery, short life expectancy, advanced cancer, or 
associated with intestinal disease).

BACKGROUND: Likely duration of survival of children described as having cerebral 
palsy is of considerable interest to individuals with cerebral palsy, their 
families, carers, health professionals, health economists and insurers. The aim 
of this paper is to describe patterns of survival and mortality to the sixth 
decade in a geographically defined population of people with cerebral palsy 
stratified according to the clinical description of their impairments in early 
childhood.
METHODS: Identifiers of persons born in Western Australia 1956-2011, registered 
with cerebral palsy on the Western Australian Register of Developmental 
Anomalies and surviving at least 12 months, were linked to the Australian 
National Death Index in December 2014. Patterns of mortality were investigated 
using survival analysis methods.
RESULTS: Of 3185 eligible persons, 436 (13.7%) had died. Of that sample the 22% 
with the mildest impairment had survival patterns similar to the general 
population. Mortality increased with increasing severity of impairment. Of 349 
(75%) with available cause of death data, 58.6% were attributed to respiratory 
causes, including 171 (49%) to pneumonia at a mean age of 14.6 (sd 13.4) years 
of which 77 (45%) were attributed to aspiration. For the most severely impaired, 
early childhood mortality increased in succeeding decades of birth cohorts from 
1950s to 1990 with 20% dying by 4 years of age in the 1981-1990 birth cohort; it 
then decreased for subsequent birth cohorts, 20% mortality not being attained 
until 15 years of age. However by 20 years of age mortality of the most severely 
impaired born in the 1991-2000 birth cohort exceeded that of all other birth 
cohorts. Remaining life expectancies by age to 50 years have been estimated for 
two strata with more severe impairments.
CONCLUSION: For 22% of individuals with cerebral palsy with mild impairment 
survival to 58 years is similar to that of the general population. Since 1990 
mortality for those with severe cerebral palsy in Western Australia has tended 
to shift from childhood to early adulthood.

Background: Recent progress in the diagnosis and treatment of primary and 
metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM) has led to a significant increase in the 
patients` expectancy of life. The development of additional primary tumors (APT) 
other than CM represents an important survival issue. Results: Of a total of 
1764 CM patients, 80 (4.5%) patients developed APT. For tumors diagnosed after 
CM, there was a 2.7 fold excess risk for APT compared to the swiss german 
population. A significantly increased risk was noted for female breast (SIR, 
2.46), male larynx (SIR, 76.92), male multiple myeloma (SIR, 11.2), male 
oesophagus (SIR, 10.8) and thyroid on males (SIR, 58.8) and females (SIR, 38.1). 
All thyroid cancer cases had a common papillary histological subtype and a high 
rate of BRAFV600E mutation. Melanoma was the primary cause of death in the vast 
majority of patients. Methods: We used the cancer registry from the 
Comprehensive Cancer Center Zurich (CCCZ) and retrospectively analyzed patients 
with CM and APT between 2008 and 2018. We calculated the risk of APT compared to 
the swiss german population using the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). 
Conclusions: Patients with CM have an increased risk for hematologic and solid 
APT. Long-term follow-up is indicated.

Liuwei Dihuang (LWDH), a famous traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in 
the clinical treatment of aging-related diseases in China. However, its 
pharmacological mechanisms are not clear. In the present study, we evaluated the 
lifespan extension effect of LWDH in C. elegans and mice and revealed its 
underlying mechanisms. The results showed that LWDH significantly extended the 
lifespan of C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner. LWDH also conferred 
protection to nematodes against oxidative stress and reduced their fat storage. 
Genetics analysis and microarray data showed that the longevity effect of LWDH 
was attributed to the regulation of the innate immune response, proteolysis, 
lipid metabolism, and the oxidation-reduction process and was dependent on 
daf-16. Among the six herbs in the formula, Radix Rehmanniae Preparata and 
Fructus Macrocarpii contributed most to the longevity effect of this medicine, 
while the other four components had a synergistic effect on the longevity effect 
of the prescription. The lack of any single herb reduced the efficacy of the 
complete formula. LWDH also extended the lifespan and reduced both the weight 
and oxidant stress status in aged mice. Taken together, these results suggested 
that LWDH might function in a multi-target manner to extend the lifespan in both 
C. elegans and aged mice, and the best effect was achieved with the complete 
formula.

Iatrogenic wounds are a common but often overlooked concept. They can lead to 
increases in hospital stays, therapy costs, repeat surgeries, and implant 
removal. If not handled properly, these wounds have a very poor prognosis and 
will cause serious physical and psychological harm to patients, which may result 
in medicolegal disputes. In recent years, the incidence of iatrogenic wounds has 
increased because of (1) an increase in the population of older people owing to
