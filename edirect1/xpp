The rapid increase of life expectancy during the last half of the 20th century 
is changing the expression of cardiovascular disease and of its risk factors. 
These findings are examined by the separate consideration of atheromatous plaque 
formation and vascular wall stiffening, known as arteriosclerosis. in humans, 
these processes may progress together, but in some other species as the rat, 
only vascular wall stiffening is observed. A saturated fat- and cholesterol-rich 
diet produces the early appearance of lipidic plaques, which progress to 
fibrous, sometimes ulcerated, thrombotic lesions. This progression is age 
dependent; the establishment of lipidic plaques is not. Vascular wall 
stiffening, characterized by an increase of the collagen-elastin ratio and 
diffuse deposition of calcium and lipids is also age dependent 
(arteriosclerosis). Although hyperlipidemia appears to be involved both in 
plaque formation and wall thickness progression, the detailed mechanisms are not 
identical. In the oldest age group (above 80 years and in centenarians), high 
cholesterol values may not be a risk factor as in younger individuals. Among the 
cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, immune factors and modifications in 
receptor coupling appear to play a major role. These mechanisms are described in 
some detail.

Expectancy in Spain.

OBJECTIVE: To study the geographical variations in Disability Free Life 
Expectancy (DFLE) at birth (DFLEb) and at 65 years (DFLE65) in Spain and to 
identify the main factors that explain these variations.
DESIGN: Ecological study with the 50 provinces of Spain as the units of 
analysis. Sullivan's method is used to calculate DFLE for each province based on 
information from the death registry and the survey on disabilities, impairments 
and handicaps. Information on the independent variables-socioeconomic level, 
factors related with the health system and risk factors-was taken from various 
sources.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Simple correlation coefficients were obtained between each 
dependent variable (DFLEb and DLFE65) and the independent variables. Two 
multiple linear regression models were fit to obtain the best set of factors 
that explain the geographical distribution of DFLEb and DLFE65.
RESULTS: Both DFLEb and DLFE65 vary widely among provinces. The multiple linear 
regression analysis shows that the illiteracy rate, the percentage of the 
unemployed and the percentage of smokers in the population were the main factors 
associated with the geographical variation of DFLE. The models explained 
approximately 40% of the variance for DFLEb and 30% for DLFE65.
CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained show the influence of education, the 
unemployment rate and smoking on the geographical differences of DFLE. The DFLE 
indicators are shown to be valid for use in health policy.

Risk attitudes of anesthesiologists and surgeons in clinical decision making 
with expected years of life.

Author information:
(1)Department of Anesthesia, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Ichihara 
Hospital, Chiba, Japan.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To understand anesthesiologists' and surgeons' risk attitudes 
about expected years of life.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Central operating rooms (ORs) in a university hospital.
RESPONDENTS: 122 anesthesiologists and surgeons.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A 7-page survey questionnaire regarding the 
length of survival and the choice of treatments was sent to 122 physicians. 
Certainty equivalents and Arrow-Pratt coefficients of absolute risk aversion 
(APC) were calculated from the survey. Of 122 physicians, 93 responded (38 
anesthesiologists and 55 surgeons; response rate 76. 2%). There was no 
significant difference in risk attitudes between the anesthesiologists and the 
surgeons. Their age was a statistically significant predictor of the risk 
attitudes: the older they were, the greater their APCs were (i.e., the more risk 
averse they were). There was no significant difference between gender in risk 
attitudes, nor was there any significant difference between the risk attitudes 
of becoming patients and those of working in the OR.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' risk attitudes cannot be predicted by their specialties 
or gender. However, the older they are, the more risk-averse they are.

Functional and oncological outcome of acetabular reconstruction for the 
treatment of metastatic disease.

10021, USA.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic disease of the acetabulum can be painful and disabling. 
Operative intervention is indicated for patients who fail to respond adequately 
to nonoperative treatment. We evaluated the functional and oncological outcome 
of acetabular reconstruction after curettage for the treatment of refractory 
symptomatic acetabular metastases.
METHODS: Fifty-five patients with metastatic disease of the acetabulum were 
treated with operative acetabular reconstruction combined with a total hip 
replacement. The most common primary tumor was carcinoma of the breast (eighteen 
patients), followed by carcinoma of the kidney (seven patients) and carcinoma of 
the prostate (seven patients). Forty (73 percent) of the patients presented with 
multiple skeletal metastases, and eighteen (33 percent) had associated visceral 
metastases. Twenty-eight (51 percent) had severe pain requiring continuous use 
of narcotics, twenty-four (44 percent) had moderate pain requiring periodic use 
of narcotics, and the remaining three (5 percent) had mild pain requiring use of 
non-narcotic analgesics. Eighteen (33 percent) of the patients could not walk, 
twenty-three (42 percent) needed a walker or crutches, twelve (22 percent) used 
a single cane, and two (4 percent) walked without assistive devices. 
Intralesional curettage of the tumor was performed in all of the patients. 
Fifty-four of the hips were reconstructed with a protrusio cup and one, with a 
hemipelvis endoprosthesis. Large defects were reinforced with cement and pin or 
screw fixation (the modified Harrington technique), which allowed transmission 
of weight-bearing forces to the remaining intact pelvis. Thirty-six acetabular 
reconstructions were performed with antegrade pins or cannulated screws; 
fifteen, with long retrograde screws; and four, with cement.
RESULTS: The median period of survival was nine months. Patients with visceral 
metastases had a median period of survival of three months compared with twelve 
months for patients without visceral metastases (p < 0.001). Patients with 
breast cancer presented later in the disease process (p < 0.004) and lived 
longer than did those with other carcinomas (p < 0.004). Forty-five patients 
were evaluated three months after reconstruction. Thirty-four (76 percent) of 
them had relief of pain as determined by decreased use of narcotics. Nine of the 
eighteen patients who could not walk preoperatively regained the ability to 
walk. Fourteen of the seventeen patients who originally were able to walk in the 
community retained that ability. Thirty-three patients were available for 
evaluation at six months. Twenty-five (76 percent) still had relief of pain, and 
nineteen (58 percent) were able to walk and function in the community. Overall, 
fourteen (25 percent) of the fifty-five patients had moderate local progression 
of the disease, and five of these patients had failure of the fixation. Fourteen 
early complications developed in twelve (22 percent) of the patients. One 
patient (2 percent) died perioperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have acetabular metastases that are refractory to 
radiation and chemotherapy have a short life expectancy. The early, gratifying 
results of reconstruction validate the role of operative treatment as a 
short-term palliative procedure. Protrusio acetabular cups presumably compensate 
for deficiencies of the medial wall, while cement and pin fixation can be used 
effectively to reconstruct large defects in the acetabular column and dome. The 
low rate of fixation failure supports the biomechanical principles of the 
reconstruction. Generally, the reconstructions are sufficiently durable to 
exceed the life expectancy of the patients.

BACKGROUND: The National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on 
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult 
Treatment Panel II) recommends treatment guidelines based on cholesterol level 
and number of risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how the cost-effectiveness ratios of cholesterol-lowering 
therapies vary according to different risk factors.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published data.
TARGET POPULATION: Women and men 35 to 84 years of age with low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 4.1 mmol/L or greater (> or =160 mg/dL), 
divided into 240 risk subgroups according to age, sex, and the presence or 
absence of four coronary heart disease risk factors (smoking status, blood 
pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol level).
TIME HORIZON: 30 years.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: Step I diet, statin therapy, and no preventive treatment for 
primary and secondary prevention.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for primary 
prevention with step I diet ranged from $1900 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained to $500000 per QALY depending on risk subgroup characteristics. 
Primary prevention with a statin compared with diet therapy was $54000 per QALY 
to $1400000 per QALY. Secondary prevention with a statin cost less than $50000 
per QALY for all risk subgroups.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The inclusion of niacin as a primary prevention 
option resulted in much less favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for 
primary prevention with a statin (>$500000 per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies varies significantly 
when adjusted for age, sex, and the presence or absence of additional risk 
factors. Primary prevention with a step I diet seems to be cost-effective for 
most risk subgroups but may not be cost-effective for otherwise healthy young 
women. Primary prevention with a statin may not be cost-effective for younger 
men and women with few risk factors, given the option of secondary prevention 
and of primary prevention in older age ranges. Secondary prevention with a 
statin seems to be cost-effective for all risk subgroups and is cost-saving in 
some high-risk subgroups.

    Ann Intern Med. 2002 Apr 16;136(8):635.

BACKGROUND: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) 
therapy has proven efficacy in reducing the rate of coronary and cerebrovascular 
events in patients 75 years of age or younger with a history of myocardial 
infarction. However, in patients older than 75 years of age, the efficacy and 
potential cost-effectiveness of statins are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of statin therapy 
compared with usual care in patients 75 to 84 years of age with previous 
myocardial infarction.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Published data from cohort studies.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients 75 to 84 years of age with a history of myocardial 
infarction.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Statin therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of statin 
therapy compared with usual care in patients 75 to 84 years of age with previous 
myocardial infarction was $18800 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: On the basis of a probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, there is a 75% chance that statin therapy costs less than $39800 per 
QALY compared with usual care. If the cost of statin therapy and efficacy of 
statin therapy at reducing myocardial infarction were set to their most 
favorable values, statin therapy cost $5400 per QALY; if cost and efficacy were 
set to their least favorable values, statin therapy cost $97800 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness ratios of statin therapy in older patients 
with previous myocardial infarction are reasonable under a wide variety of 
assumptions about drug efficacy, drug cost, and rates of cardiac and 
cerebrovascular events. Pending results of randomized, controlled trials of 
secondary prevention in patients in this age group, statin therapy seems to be 
as cost-effective as many routinely accepted medical interventions in this 
setting.

BACKGROUND: Hot flashes are the most frequently reported side effect of 
tamoxifen treatment. Although hormones are an effective treatment, their safety 
is questionable in women with breast cancer. It is therefore important to 
evaluate nonhormonal treatments for hot flashes.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of oral clonidine for control of hot 
flashes associated with tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women with breast 
cancer.
DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
SETTING: University of Rochester Cancer Center Community Clinical Oncology 
Program.
PATIENTS: 194 postmenopausal women with breast cancer who were receiving 
adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.
INTERVENTION: Oral clonidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mg/d, or placebo for 8 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: In a daily diary, patients recorded number, duration, and severity 
of hot flashes and overall quality-of-life score (on a 10-point scale) during a 
1-week baseline period and during the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of the study.
RESULTS: Patients in the placebo and treatment groups were similar in age, 
duration of tamoxifen use, reported frequency and duration of hot flashes at 
baseline, and dropout rates. One hundred forty-nine patients completed 12 weeks 
of follow-up. The mean decrease in hot flash frequency was greater in the 
clonidine group than in the placebo group after 4 weeks of treatment (37% 
compared with 20% [95% CI for difference, 7% to 27%]) and 8 weeks of treatment 
(38% compared with 24% [CI for difference, 3% to 27%]). Patients receiving 
clonidine were more likely than patients receiving placebo to report difficulty 
sleeping (41% compared with 21%; P = 0.02). A significant difference was seen in 
the mean change in quality-of-life scores (0.3 points in the clonidine group 
compared with -0.2 points in the placebo group; P = 0.02) at 8 weeks, although 
the median difference was 0 in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Oral clonidine, 0.1 mg/d, is effective against tamoxifen-induced hot 
flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

In vitro-cultured bovine oviductal cells bind acrosome-intact sperm and retain 
this ability upon sperm release.

The mammalian oviduct plays a key role in sperm storage, capacitation, and 
selection. Specific oviduct secretions and/or binding to oviductal cells are 
thought to be responsible for the extension of the fertile life span of sperm. 
In this in vitro study, a quantitative assay for sperm binding was developed to 
analyze the mechanisms of sperm-oviductal cell adhesion and release in the 
bovine species. Distribution and acrosomal status of sperm bound to in 
vitro-cultured ampullary and isthmic cell monolayers were followed until the 
time of sperm release by means of fluorescence labeling techniques. In order to 
understand whether release is due to surface changes of sperm or oviductal 
cells, double incubation experiments with unlabeled and Hoechst-labeled sperm 
have been performed. Main findings demonstrate that (1) only acrosome-intact 
sperm bind specific bovine oviductal epithelial cells; (2) acrosomes of bound 
sperm are preserved intact over time; and (3) release of unreacted sperm is 
likely to be due to changes of the sperm surface, probably triggered by 
capacitation. These findings support the hypothesis that binding to oviductal 
cells is essential for preserving the sperm fertilization competence during the 
interval from the onset of estrus to ovulation.

[Pharmacoeconomic evaluation of pravastatin in coronary secondary prevention in 
patients with myocardial infarct or unstable angina pectoris. An analysis based 
on the LIPID Study].

BACKGROUND: Secondary coronary prevention with lipid lowering drugs have become 
a major issue in health policy formulation due to the large upfront investment 
in drug therapy. The recently completed LIPID trial with pravastatin in 
secondary prevention immediately raise the question whether pravastatin might be 
cost-effective in Switzerland.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of 
third party payers. The following costs were included in the analysis: daily 
treatment costs of pravastatin, non fatal myocardial infarction, coronary bypass 
operations and stroke. Life years gained was obtained by applying the declining 
exponential approximation of life expectancy. All calculations were standardized 
to 1000 treated patients.
RESULTS: The net costs of treating 1000 patients (i.e. drug costs minus the 
costs of sequelae and interventions) are Fr. 3.6 Mio. In addition, a total of 
430 life-years may be saved through treatment. The corresponding 
cost-effectiveness of pravastatin treatment is Fr. 8341 (nominal) Fr. 6985 
(discounted).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of pravastatin in 
secondary prevention lie well within the threshold of other commonly accepted 
medical interventions and may be considered an economically viable approach for 
secondary coronary prevention.

Savings in the cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease in Canada: 
an analysis of treatment with rivastigmine.

Park, North Carolina 27709-2194, USA. Hauber@RTI.org

OBJECTIVE: To estimate per-patient potential cost savings using rivastigmine in 
the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Canada.
BACKGROUND: In recent years, new members of a class of pharmaceuticals known as 
cholinesterase inhibitors have been introduced for the treatment of patients 
with AD. Two recent studies conducted in the United Kingdom and the United 
States estimated potential cost savings from the new cholinesterase inhibitor 
rivastigmine. The present study combined the disease-progression model used in 
those 2 studies with Canadian costs to estimate per-patient potential savings 
resulting from the treatment of AD in Canada.
METHODS: Efficacy data from 2 pivotal, phase III clinical trials of rivastigmine 
were used in a hazard model of disease progression to estimate long-term 
differences in cognitive functioning between patients receiving rivastigmine and 
patients receiving no treatment. We used the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) score as our measure of disease progression. We also used Canadian costs 
of AD care, estimated as a function of MMSE score, to estimate cost savings 
experienced by treated patients compared with patients receiving no treatment. 
All costs and cost savings are presented in 1997 Canadian dollars. We used a 
societal perspective in this analysis.
RESULTS: Rivastigmine was estimated to delay the transition to more severe 
stages of AD by up to 188 days for patients with mild AD after 2 years of 
treatment. For patients with mild-to-moderate and moderate disease, this delay 
was estimated to be 106 and 44 days, respectively. For patients with the mild 
stage of AD, estimated average daily cost savings (excluding the cost of 
rivastigmine) ranged from Can $0.45 per patient per day at 6 months to Can $6.44 
per patient per day after 2 years of treatment. For all patients, these 
estimated average daily cost savings ranged from a low of Can $0.71 per patient 
per day after 6 months of treatment to a high of Can $4.93 per patient per day 
after 2 years.
CONCLUSION: On average, treatment with rivastigmine yields savings in the direct 
cost of caring for AD patients that exceed the cost of the drug after 2 years of 
treatment.

Decreasing seasonal variation of births in schizophrenia.

Suvisaari JM(1), Haukka JK, Tanskanen AJ, Lönnqvist JK.

Institute, Helsinki, Finland.

BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia have a winter-spring excess of births 
compared with the general population, the cause of which is unresolved. 
Fluctuations in the magnitude of the seasonal variation may provide clues to its 
aetiology.
METHODS: All Finnish patients with schizophrenia born between 1950 and 1969 (N = 
15892) were identified from two nationwide health-care registers. Their 
background demographic information was obtained from the Population Register 
Centre, which also provided monthly numbers of births in each municipality of 
Finland as multidimensional tables, with sex and year, month and place of birth 
as marginals. The incidence of schizophrenia was modelled using Poisson 
regression analysis, with sex, onset age, birth cohort, place of birth 
(urban/rural), trend and seasonal variation as explanatory variables. We also 
constructed a monthly time series and decomposed it into three 
components--seasonal, trend and remainder.
RESULTS: Seasonal variation of births among patients born in the 1950s, 
especially between 1955 and 1959, was marked, but decreased among patients born 
in the 1960s. No interaction between place of birth or sex and seasonal 
variation was observed. The incidence was higher among the rural-born than the 
urban-born, but declined more slowly among the urban-born than the rural-born.
CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of the factor causing the seasonal variation of 
births in schizophrenia may be decreasing. Urban birth may be emerging as a risk 
factor for schizophrenia in Finland, as elsewhere.

Neoplastic diseases are now among the most commonly seen conditions. Orthodox, 
non-surgical approaches, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have variable 
results, but many adverse affects that limit their use. These are sometimes the 
direct cause of death. More patients are choosing alternative treatments, mainly 
the homeopathic and herbal-nutrition approach. Homeopathy does not have highly 
effective remedies for cancer in its literature, and has been limited to 
palliating the adverse effects of chemo/radiotherapy. Research into substances 
that can produce neoplastic diseases (carcinogens), may lead to them being used 
to treat the cancer they cause, according to the principle of similarity. I have 
used ultra-low doses (1 x 10(-10) to 10(-12) molar) of chemical carcinogens for 
3-24 months, which have been given to cancer patients, usually in conjunction 
with conventional treatment. Using this procedure, complete remission or life 
extension has been achieved for some cancer cases. Three clinical cases are 
presented: a man with undifferentiated lung cancer; a child with an astrocytoma 
and a woman with leiomyosarcoma.

11040, USA. rose@lij.edu

BACKGROUND: The benefits of screening for latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
infection are unknown for most people, because screening has not been studied in 
clinical trials and preventive therapy has not been tested in all risk groups 
for whom it is recommended.
METHOD: A MEDLINE search was performed to determine tuberculosis risk. A Markov 
model was used to analyze tuberculin skin test screening and preventive therapy 
for 3-year-old and 30-year-old persons with positive test results. Outcome 
measures were lifetime and 10-year tuberculosis risk, including spread to 
others, life expectancy extension, and number needed to screen and number needed 
to treat to prevent 1 case and 1 death during 10 years.
RESULTS: The benefits of screening and preventive therapy outweigh the risks for 
all groups tested, although the benefits range from large to small. The number 
needed to screen to prevent 1 case is 10 to 6888, and the number needed to treat 
is 2 to 179. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection, intravenous 
drug abuse, or end-stage renal disease treated with transplantation and children 
exposed to high-risk adults have the highest tuberculosis rates and the lowest 
number needed to screen and number needed to treat to prevent cases and deaths. 
The range of risks found in the literature for some risk groups, such as persons 
with silicosis, leukemia or lymphoma, end-stage renal disease treated with 
dialysis, or prolonged corticosteroid therapy, is wide and, as a result, the 
benefits of screening are uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of screening and preventive therapy vary widely, 
although the benefits outweigh the risks for all risk groups. The benefits are 
large for some risk groups and uncertain for others.

The case for financial incentives to encourage organ donation.

Lysaght MJ(1), Mason J.

Author information:
(1)Biomed Center, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA.

The existing system of organ procurement has failed in its mission of providing 
an adequate number of organs for transplantation. The organ shortfall results in 
diminished life expectancy and quality of life for dialysis patients and in 
increased mortality for patients with end-stage cardiac disease and liver 
failure who are unable to obtain transplants. Oft-repeated arguments against 
sale of human organs do not stand up to careful examination, and seem 
anachronistic in the context of widespread current acceptance of financial 
incentives for tissue donation in analogous fields, such as reproductive 
medicine. This essay advocates the staged introduction of a reward-based system 
of organ donation, initially for cadaveric harvesting and, possibly, later for 
living donation. Although imperfect, the proposed approach would represent a 
significant improvement over the status quo.

Limits to rationality: economics, economists and priority setting.

Robinson R(1).

Author information:
(1)LSE Health, London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK.

This paper investigates why economic approaches to priority setting have had 
only limited impact in practice. It argues that obstacles to the take-up of the 
economic approach centre on (1) limitations in the theory and practice of 
economic evaluations, and (2) the nature of the wider context within which 
decisions on priority setting take place. On the first point, it argues that, 
despite advances in research methods, there is still debate about the 
theoretical basis of measures typically used in economic evaluations, such as 
QALYs, and that much of the extant empirical data is of questionable quality. On 
the second point, it maintains that politicians, health care professionals and 
local people attach importance to other factors besides allocative efficiency. 
If economic approaches are to have more impact in the future, it argues that 
health economists need to adopt a wider research agenda, focusing on public 
sector decision-making and, in particular, the incentives and constraints 
governing the use of economic data in different types of health care 
organisation.

Germany.

BACKGROUND: Despite great advances in intensive care medicine, sepsis still is 
the leading cause of death. Different strategies have been developed to file the 
patient data into scoring systems, primarily to predict the outcome. The Markov 
simulation-predominantly used in economic science to describe chains of events 
depending on and influencing each other-seems to be an interesting and new 
approach in analyzing the course of disease of critically ill patients in an 
intensive care unit (ICU). Using such a Markov model, this study analyzes data 
from 660 surgical ICU patients, 44 of whom died of sepsis.
METHODS: A three-state Markov model (integrating sepsis, adult respiratory 
distress syndrome, and mortality) was constructed to describe the course of 
disease of critically ill patients in defined cycles and to develop the risk 
profile of different groups of patients. The model enables the comparison 
between age- and sex-related survival rates and shows the difference in life 
expectancy compared with an average untreated standard population.
RESULTS: Women aged up to 30 years (G1F) show the best prognosis (mortality 
after 19 cycles 8.3%). On the contrary, the corresponding male group (G1M) 
demonstrates the worst outcome (mortality after 19 cycles 57.7 %).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study fit into the current discussion that 
female patients are better positioned to meet the challenge of sepsis.

[Imaging of orbital metastasis of small-intestine carcinoid by octreotide 
scintigraphy. A critical evaluation of the methodology].

[Article in German]

Guthoff R(1), Lieb WE, Rendl J, Reiners C.

Author information:
(1)Augenklinik der Universität Würzburg.

BACKGROUND: An orbital carcinoid metastasis can be specifically imaged by 
octreotide scintigraphy. Orbital metastases of carcinoid tumors are rare. In the 
current literature only 27 cases have been published.
CASE REPORT: We report on a 59 year-old woman who presented with diplopia 6 
years after resection of a carcinoid tumor of the ileum. She also complained 
about flush and diarrhea. The diplopia was caused by limited extensibility of 
the right inferior muscle. Computed tomography with contrast revealed an 
enhancing tumor in the area of the right inferior rectus muscle, which appeared 
in the MRT as an isointense structure in the T1-weighted image. On staging, we 
found a contrast-enhancing nodular hepatic lesion. In octreotide scintigraphy, 
enhancement of the liver, thoracic and abdominal para-aortic lymph nodes and of 
the right inferior orbit was found.
CONCLUSION: The survival times of patients with orbital metastasis of carcinoid 
tumors range between 7 months and 11 years. No specific treatment is available. 
Surgical excision is indicated for a symptomatic solitary metastasis. Octreotide 
is helpful in two ways: (1) as a radiolabeled tracer to detect extra-abdominal 
and extrahepatic secondary tumors; (2) as a treatment modality for flush and 
diarrhea, which is successful in over 60% of patients (life expectancy 
uninfluenced). Our patient is presently being treated with 200 micrograms of 
octreotide three times a day subcutaneously. Flush episodes and diarrhea have 
been reduced, but her ophthalmologic symptoms remain unchanged, and she has 
recently developed cardiac insufficiency.

Relation between response to illness and compliance in haemodialysis patients.

Saounatsou M(1).

Author information:
(1)Technological Educational Institution, Athens, Greece.

The treatment schedule of the haemodialysis patient has many restrictions and 
the long-term haemodialysis patient's response to illness is characterised by 
various emotional reactions. Compliance with their medical regimens remains a 
significant problem which influences the progress of health and by extension 
quality of life. The preconceived idea that a patient's response to illness may 
influence his adherence to medical regimen led to this study. The main variables 
examined were the relationship between the patient's response to illness and 
compliance and the relationship between compliance and age, education and the 
length of time on haemodialysis.

Quality management within a cost-constrained service.

Badger TG(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Nursing Studies, University of Central England, Birmingham, UK.

AIM: To examine the meaning of quality and ways in which quality can be improved 
despite budgetary limitations.
KEY ISSUES: Definitions of quality are discussed, comparing the development from 
industrial concepts of quality to that contained within the Department of 
Health's A First CLASS SERVICE: The relationship of cost and quality is examined 
and the effects of changing treatments on healthcare costs explored. Clinical 
error is identified as a cause of increased cost through failure to maintain 
quality. A variety of quality tools are discussed in identifying ways in which 
quality can be improved within a cost-limited service. Thrombolysis is used as 
an exemplar and the effects on nursing discussed.
CONCLUSION: There is research evidence which demonstrates that some areas of 
quality are amenable to improvement despite budgetary constraints.

Socioeconomic status and the expectation of disability in old age: estimates for 
England.

Melzer D(1), McWilliams B, Brayne C, Johnson T, Bond J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge.

OBJECTIVES: The longer life expectancy in old age of more privileged 
socioeconomic groups is well established, but less clear is whether the net 
effect of additional years of life is a lengthened, stable or reduced duration 
of disability. Estimates of healthy and disabled life expectancy (using 
definitions including dependency in activities of daily living and cognitive 
impairment) were made, contrasting occupational classes I and II (professional 
and managerial) with the rest.
DESIGN: Disability prevalence was estimated from the Medical Research Council 
Cognitive Function and Ageing study. Sullivan's method was used to calculate 
health expectancy.
SUBJECTS: 10,377 people aged 65 years or over in Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, 
Nottingham and Oxford. Subjects were classified as disabled if they had evidence 
of dementia (using the Automated Geriatric Examination Computer Assisted 
Taxonomy) or scored 11 or more on the modified Townsend Disability scale, at 
baseline screen.
RESULTS: The prevalence of disability overall and need for "constant care" was 
lower in both men and women in social classes I and II compared with the rest. 
Men aged 65 to 69 in classes I and II can expect nearly 14 years of life free of 
disability compared with 11.5 years for those in classes III to V: for women the 
equivalent expectations are 15.5 and 13.8 years. Men aged 65 to 69 in classes I 
and II can also expect a shorter duration of disability: 1 year compared with 
1.6 years for classes III to V. In women expectation of disability is higher 
overall, but shows little difference by occupational class.
CONCLUSIONS: Relatively privileged socioeconomic groups in England, especially 
men, can expect fewer years of disability despite longer overall life 
expectancy. These findings lend weight to optimistic scenarios for the future 
numbers of older people with disability.

Jolla, USA

Objectives: To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of modafinil in patients 
with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy.Background: 
Modafinil has been shown to be effective and well tolerated for treating EDS 
associated with narcolepsy in two large-scale, well-controlled, 9-week clinical 
trials.Methods: Four hundred and seventy eight adult patients with a diagnosis 
of narcolepsy who had completed one of two 9-week, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trials of modafinil were enrolled in 
two 40-week, open-label, extension studies. A flexible-dose regimen (i.e. 200, 
300, or 400 mg daily) was followed in one study. In the second study, patients 
received 200 mg/day for 1 week, followed by 400 mg/day for 1 week. Investigators 
then prescribed either 200- or 400-mg doses for the duration of the study. 
Efficacy was evaluated using Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) 
scores, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the 36-item Medical Outcomes 
Study health survey (SF-36). Adverse events were recorded. Data from the two 
studies were combined.Results: The majority of patients ( approximately 75%) 
received 400 mg of modafinil daily. Disease severity improved in >80% of 
patients throughout the 40-week study. At weeks 2, 8, 24, and 40, disease 
severity was 'much improved' or 'very much improved' in 49, 58, 59, and 58% of 
patients, respectively. The mean (+/-SEM) ESS score improved significantly from 
16.5+/-0.2 at open-label baseline to 12.4+/-0.2 at week 2 and remained at that 
level through week 40 (P<0.001). Quality of life scores at weeks 4, 8, 24, and 
40 were significantly improved versus open-label baseline scores for six of the 
eight SF-36 domains (P<0.001). The most common treatment-related adverse events 
were headache (13%), nervousness (8%), and nausea (5%). Most adverse events were 
mild to moderate in nature. A total of 341 patients (71%) completed the studies. 
Forty-three patients (9.0%) discontinued treatment because of adverse 
events.Conclusions: Modafinil is effective for the long-term treatment of EDS 
associated with narcolepsy and significantly improves perceptions of general 
health. Modafinil is well tolerated, with no evidence of tolerance developing 
during 40 weeks of treatment.

Relapse is a serious complication following high-dose therapy and autologous 
bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for malignant lymphoma (ML). Allogeneic 
transplantation (alloSCT) is a therapeutic option. However, it is associated 
with a high incidence of transplant-related organ toxicity and mortality. We 
recently reported fast engraftment and minimal transplant-related toxicity, 
using fludarabine-based conditioning with reduced amounts of chemotoxic drugs 
prior to alloSCT. We now present our experience with 23 heavily treated high 
risk ML patients who underwent matched alloSCT following the same low intensity 
conditioning. The patients (20 male, three female) were aged 13-63 years. 
Nineteen had NHL and four HD (resistant disease 12, partial remission 11). Five 
were post ABMT. Twenty-two patients had fully matched sibling donors, and one a 
fully matched unrelated donor. Engraftment was fast. There was no rejection or 
non-engraftment. Organ toxicity was moderate with no liver or renal toxicity 
>grade II. Four patients developed >grade II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 
Seven patients died - four of grade III-IV GVHD and severe infections, two of 
bacterial sepsis, one of pulmonary failure. Ten patients are alive after 22.5 
(15-37) months. Survival and disease-free survival at 37 months are both 40%. 
Probability of relapse is 26%. These encouraging results suggest that alloSCT 
following fludarabine-based low intensity conditioning in high-risk patients 
merits further evaluation. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2000).

All patients receiving autografts for acute leukaemia in remission between 1 
January 1981 and 31 December 1996 and reported to the European Group for Blood 
and Marrow Transplantation and had a relapse, were included. The patients 
underwent an allograft (n = 90, group A), were treated with chemotherapy (n = 
2584, group B) or received a second autograft (n = 74, group C). The 2-year 
survival after relapse was 32 +/- 5%, 11 +/- 1% and 42 +/- 6% in groups A, B and 
C, respectively. In group A, those with an HLA-A, -B and -DR compatible related 
or unrelated donor had a 2-year survival of 37 +/- 7% compared to 13 +/- 8% for 
those receiving a graft from an HLA mismatched donor (n = 20). The following 
factors were associated with better survival in multivariate analyses: an 
interval from first autograft to relapse >5 months (P < 0.00001), a first 
autograft performed later than 1991 (P < 0.00001), patient age below 26 years 
(median, P < 0.002), group B vs HLA mismatches from group A (P = 0.002), group C 
vs group B (P < 0.005), patients who were not treated with total body 
irradiation at first autograft (P < 0.02) and patients in first remission at 
first autograft (P = 0.02). To conclude, the poor outcome in these patients was 
improved if a second autograft was feasible (P < 0.005), or if an HLA-matched 
allograft was performed (NS). Bone Marrow Transplantation (2000).

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the commonest lethal inherited conditions among 
Caucasians. It affects multiple organ systems and exhibits a range of clinical 
problems of varying severity. Life expectancy has improved in recent years as 
treatment regimes have become more intensive, but current treatments are 
expensive, often time consuming and may affect quality of life. This review 
summarises the treatments currently used in the management of patients with CF, 
and the evidence for these.

HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 33-year-old man with fulminant hepatitis B 
infection was to have an orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) because of the
