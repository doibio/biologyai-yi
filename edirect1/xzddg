Stroke is the second leading cause of death and dependency in Europe and costs 
the European Union more than €30bn, yet significant gaps in the patient pathway 
remain and the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive stroke care to meet these 
needs is unknown. The European Brain Council Value of Treatment Initiative 
combined patient representatives, stroke experts, neurological societies and 
literature review to identify unmet needs in the patient pathway according to 
Rotterdam methodology. The cost-effectiveness of comprehensive stroke services 
was determined by a Markov model, using UK cost data as an exemplar and efficacy 
data for prevention of death and dependency from published systematic reviews 
and trials, expressing effectiveness as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
Model outcomes included total costs, total QALYs, incremental costs, incremental 
QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Key unmet needs in 
the stroke patient pathway included inadequate treatment of atrial fibrillation 
(AF), access to neurorehabilitation and implementation of comprehensive stroke 
services. In the Markov model, full implementation of comprehensive stroke 
services was associated with a 9.8% absolute reduction in risk of death of 
dependency, at an intervention cost of £9566 versus £6640 for standard care, and 
long-term care costs of £35 169 per 5.1251 QALYS vs. £32 347.40 per 4.5853 
QALYs, resulting in an ICER of £5227.89. Results were robust in one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Implementation of comprehensive stroke 
services is a cost-effective approach to meet unmet needs in the stroke patient 
pathway, to improve acute stroke care and support better treatment of AF and 
access to neurorehabilitation.

Hemorrhagic extension along the pulmonary arteries should be recognized as a 
complication of Stanford type A aortic dissection. Radiologists and other 
physicians with an interest in cardiothoracic imaging should be aware of this 
rare but life-threatening pathology. The anatomical concept of the pathology is 
outlined in this text, through high-quality electrocardiogram-gated computerized 
tomography images.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of 
Tofacitinib (TFC) in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had not 
responded well to methotrexate from the Iranian payer's perspective.
METHODS: An individual microsimulation Markov model was developed to compare TFC 
with etanercept (ETN) and Adalimumab (ADA) over a life-time horizon. Treatment 
efficacy was estimated based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
response improvement criteria in 6 months. Changes in the Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ) scores were mapped onto utility values to calculate outcomes 
in terms of QALYs. Direct medical costs were taken from national databases. 
Uncertainty in model parameters was evaluated by sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: This study demonstrated that TFC was cost-effective in both scenarios. 
Although TFC was associated with lower QALYs than ETN (6.664 versus 6.876), it 
was also associated with lower costs over a life-time horizon ($42,565.04 versus 
$58,696.29). Additionally, TFC was found to be the dominant strategy with a 
lower cost ($50,299.91 versus $51,550.29) and higher QALYs gained (6.900 versus 
6.687) compared to ADA.
CONCLUSION: TFC was found to be cost-effective in patients with severe RA who do 
not respond well to methotrexate compared to ADA, ETN in Iran.

INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative cardiac arrest (ICA) is a feared complication 
during liver transplantation (LTx), typically occurring during reperfusion. 
Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has been used for 
post-reperfusion cardiac arrest.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of successful resuscitation after hyperkalemic 
ICA during the pre-anhepatic phase of a second liver transplantation by 
converting veno-venous bypass (VVB) to VA-ECMO.
DISCUSSION: While this technique has been recommended for ICA during 
reperfusion, it has never been reported during the pre-anhepatic phase. VA-ECMO 
can be a lifesaving extension to cardiopulmonary resuscitation for ICA during 
LTx with beneficial neurological outcome by providing perfusion while the cause 
of ICA is reversed.
CONCLUSION: Conversion of VVB to VA-ECMO should be considered in all patients 
who suffer from ICA during LTx with use of VVB. With VVB installed, conversion 
to VA-ECMO is fast and effective. If VVB is not used, early VA-ECMO should be 
considered for ICA.

OBJECTIVE: To provide tribe- specific child mortality rates and health 
indicators from selected states in India.
METHODS: We used Census 2011 data and Coale Demney methodology to estimate the 
infant mortality rate (IMR), under-five mortality rate (U5MR) and expectation of 
life at birth (LEB) for 123 tribes of selected states of India.
RESULTS: The estimated IMR and U5MR were higher in scheduled tribe population 
compared to respective state's total population. The IMR varied from 124 in the 
Birhore tribe of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, and the Bharias of Madhya Pradesh 
to 48 per 1000 live births in the Gamit tribe of Maharashtra. Similarly, the 
U5MR varied from the highest (203) in the Birhore tribe of Chhattisgarh to the 
lowest (57/1000 live births) in the Gamit tribe. The LEB varied from 72 years in 
the Gamit tribe of Maharashtra to 51 years in the Birhore tribe of Chhattisgarh. 
The study reveals that tribes have gross variation in child mortality rates and 
there is pressing need to prioritize tribe-specific action plans to improve 
their health indicators.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review the outcomes and future challenges associated with 
pediatric vascularized composite allotransplantation, including follow-up data 
from our bilateral pediatric hand-forearm transplantation.
RECENT FINDINGS: In 2015, the first heterologous pediatric upper extremity 
hand-forearm transplant was performed at the Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia, and in 2019, the first pediatric neck reconstructive 
transplantation was performed in Poland. The 5-year follow-up of the pediatric 
upper extremity recipient demonstrates similar growth rates bilaterally, an 
increase in bone age parallel to chronologic age, and perhaps similar overall 
growth to nontransplant norms. The pediatric upper extremity recipient continues 
to make gains in functional independence. He excels academically and 
participates in various extracurricular activities. Future challenges unique to 
the pediatric population include ethical issues of informed consent, 
psychosocial implications, limited donor pool, posttransplant compliance issues, 
and greater life expectancy and therefore time to inherit the many complications 
of immunosuppression.
SUMMARY: Currently, we recommend pediatric vascularized composite 
allotransplantation (VCA) for bilateral upper extremity amputees, preferably on 
immunosuppression already, and those patients who would have the most potential 
gain not available through standard reconstructive techniques while being able 
to comply with postoperative immunosuppression protocols, surveillance, 
rehabilitation, and follow-up.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a 
progressive, severe brain disorder, which mainly affects people above the age of 
65 years. iNPH is characterized by the accumulation of excess cerebrospinal 
fluid in the brain's ventricles. In most cases, iNPH patients can be effectively 
treated with shunt surgery, which involves placing a tube into the brain to 
drain the excess fluid. As part of the European Brain Council-led Value of 
Treatment project, this study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of 
delivering timely and adequate iNPH treatment in Germany.
METHODS: The study identified treatment gaps that prevent iNPH patients from 
receiving adequate and timely treatment. The cost-effectiveness of delivering 
shunt surgery to iNPH-prevalent patients aged ≥65 years in Germany was 
calculated using decision-analytical modelling. The model compared two 
alternatives, current care (shunt surgery in 25% of iNPH cases) and target care 
(shunt surgery in 90% of iNPH cases), and looked at healthcare costs (diagnosis, 
shunt intervention and follow-up care) from the public health insurance 
perspective, as well as effectiveness outcomes in terms of lives saved and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: Delivering timely and adequate iNPH treatment proved to be 
cost-effective. Cost per life saved varied between €27 921 at 5 years and 
€246 726 at 15 years. Cost-per-QALY estimates varied between €10 202 at 5 years 
and €35 128 at 15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a treatable but often 
not-treated disease, resulting in unnecessary and avoidable disease burden for 
the healthcare system. Actions required to close this treatment gap are 
straightforward and their implementation has been modelled with successful 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have received political attention 
and commitment, yet surveillance is needed to measure progress and set 
priorities. Building on global estimates suggesting that Peru is not on target 
to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, we estimated the contribution of 
various NCDs to the change in unconditional probability of dying from NCDs in 25 
regions in Peru.
METHODS: Using national death registries and census data, we estimated the 
unconditional probability of dying between ages 30 and 69 from any and from each 
of the following NCDs: cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory 
diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated the contribution of each NCD 
to the change in the unconditional probability of dying from any of these NCDs 
between 2006 and 2016.
RESULTS: The overall unconditional probability of dying improved for men (21.4%) 
and women (23.3%). Cancer accounted for 10.9% in men and 13.7% in women of the 
overall reduction; cardiovascular diseases also contributed substantially: 11.3% 
in men) and 9.8% in women. Consistently in men and women and across regions, 
diabetes moved in the opposite direction of the overall reduction in the 
unconditional probability of dying from any selected NCD. Diabetes contributed a 
rise in the unconditional probability of 3.6% in men and 2.1% in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the unconditional probability of dying from any selected 
NCD has decreased, diabetes would prevent Peru from meeting international 
targets. Policies are needed to prevent diabetes and to strengthen healthcare to 
avoid diabetes-related complications and delay mortality.

BACKGROUND: Moroccan incidence of cancer is increasing with the lengthening of 
life expectancy. Data regarding elderly Moroccan cancer patients are lacking. In 
the context of our project aiming to develop an adapted version of the 
Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment CGA to the Moroccan population, we launched 
the first Moroccan multicenter transverse study to explore the characteristics 
of elderly Moroccan cancer patients.
METHODS: The study was conducted in nine Moroccan medical oncology departments. 
Patients were enrolled over 4 months. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 
65 years or over with verified solid cancer. The questionnaire included four 
sections: socio-demographic and economic data, clinical data, vulnerability and 
EORTC-QLQ C30. We explored the entire included population. Then, we compared the 
results according to age (65-70 years old and ≥ 71 years old) and sex. We also 
explored the correlation between G8 scores and the ability to practice religion 
as an indicator of fitness level.
RESULTS: In total, 164 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 
73.18 ± 6.01 years. The majority of patients were married, lived with their 
children and received their financial income from them. Fifteen percent of 
families asked to hide the diagnosis from the patient. Breast (23%), colorectal 
(15.9%) and lung (14%) cancers were the most frequent, and 83.5% had an abnormal 
G8. The majority of the patients were independent for basic daily activities. 
Female patients had poorer social and economic conditions. Abnormal G8 was 
correlated with religious practice and quality of life scores.
CONCLUSION: This is the first multicenter prospective study designed to collect 
data on the lifestyle and clinical profiles of elderly Moroccan cancer patients 
as an Arab and Muslim population. Our study shows that it is a well-cared-for 
population with strong social ties. However, there is deep economic 
vulnerability, especially among women, requiring urgent care. Religious practice 
is an important daily activity for our elderly patients and should be included 
in the Moroccan CGA.

Does unfairness sound wrong? A cross-domain investigation of expectations in 
music and social decision-making.

Civai C(1), Teodorini R(1), Carrus E(1).

University, London, UK.

This study was interested in investigating the existence of a shared 
psychological mechanism for the processing of expectations across domains. The 
literature on music and language shows that violations of expectations produce 
similar neural responses and violating the expectation in one domain may 
influence the processing of stimuli in the other domain. Like music and 
language, our social world is governed by a system of inherent rules or norms, 
such as fairness. The study therefore aimed to draw a parallel to the social 
domain and investigate whether a manipulation of melodic expectation can 
influence the processing of higher-level expectations of fairness. Specifically, 
we aimed to investigate whether the presence of an unexpected melody enhances or 
reduces participants' sensitivity to the violations of fairness and the 
behavioural reactions associated with these. We embedded a manipulation of 
melodic expectation within a social decision-making paradigm, whereby musically 
expected and unexpected stimuli will be simultaneously presented with fair and 
unfair divisions in a third-party altruistic punishment game. Behavioural and 
electroencephalographic responses were recorded. Results from the pre-planned 
analyses show that participants are less likely to punish when melodies are more 
unexpected and that violations of fairness norms elicit medial frontal 
negativity (MFN)-life effects. Because no significant interactions between 
melodic expectancy and fairness of the division were found, results fail to 
provide evidence of a shared mechanism for the processing of expectations. 
Exploratory analyses show two additional effects: (i) unfair divisions elicit an 
early attentional component (P2), probably associated with stimulus saliency, 
and (ii) mid-value divisions elicit a late MFN-like component, probably 
reflecting stimulus ambiguity. Future studies could build on these results to 
further investigate the effect of the cross-domain influence of music on the 
processing of social stimuli on these early and late components.

BACKGROUND: The STOPPFrail criteria were developed to assist physicians in 
deprescribing medications among frail patients approaching end of life. We aimed 
to measure the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and to 
describe changes over time, using STOPPFrail, in frail nursing home residents 
(NHRs) with limited life expectancy included in a medication review trial.
METHODS: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the COME-ON study, a 
cluster-controlled trial that evaluated the effect of a complex intervention on 
appropriateness of prescribing in Belgian nursing homes. We identified NHRs 
eligible for the application of STOPPFrail based on functional status, 
comorbidities, level of care and survival. PIM use was measured at baseline and 
at 8 months. Changes over time were compared in the control group (CG) and 
intervention group (IG).
RESULTS: At baseline, 308 NHRs met the STOPPFrail eligibility criteria, of whom 
196 (64.1%) had one or more PIM. At 8 months, among the 218 NHRs who were alive, 
there was an absolute reduction in the prevalence of PIMs of 9.1% in the CG 
(p < 0.05) and 10.2% in the IG (p < 0.05). We found large reductions for some 
medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors) but no reduction for others (e.g. 
calcium). The percentage of NHRs with one or more PIM discontinued without a new 
PIM initiated was higher in the IG than the CG but the difference was not 
significant (35.1% vs 23.6%, p = 0.127).
CONCLUSION: Among frail NHRs with poor survival prognosis, a significant and 
encouraging decrease in PIM prevalence over time was observed, probably 
facilitated by medication reviews. The overall prevalence of PIMs remained high, 
however.

AIM: Psychotic disorders have long-term negative consequences for functioning 
and quality of life. Ultra-high risk (UHR) programs aim to identify and treat 
people during the prodromal period before their first psychotic episode. Though 
studies on the clinical effectiveness of treating prodromal symptoms in people 
at UHR for psychosis exist, no review has exclusively and comprehensively 
evaluated the economic impact of UHR programs. Our objective was to 
systematically review the literature on economic evaluations of UHR programs.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo electronic 
databases, in addition to grey literature, from inception to March 2020 to 
identify economic evaluations of UHR programs. We included all cost and 
cost-effectiveness studies of interventions for people at UHR. The data were 
synthesized qualitatively, and a risk of bias assessment was performed.
RESULTS: Of the 1916 articles retrieved, six studies met our inclusion criteria. 
These included three cost analysis studies and three cost-effectiveness studies. 
Five studies were conducted from the health system perspective and the time 
horizon varied between six months and ten years. Only two reported 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as their outcome. Overall, all 
cost-effectiveness studies and one cost analysis suggested that UHR programs 
were cost-effective and cost saving, respectively. The risk of bias assessment 
suggested moderate levels of bias across all studies.
CONCLUSION: Economic evaluations of UHR programs varied in terms of outcomes and 
length of follow-up; however, most studies found them to be cost-effective. 
Future studies would benefit from long-term evaluations of UHR programs and 
consistent valuation of outcomes.

AIMS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is generally associated with mild 
disability and normal life expectancy. On the other hand, once the end-stage 
phase of HCM characterized by left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction < 50% is 
established, patients with this subtype have a poor prognosis. This study 
clarifies the clinical parameters associated with progression to end-stage HCM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 157 HCM patients (age 
59.9 ± 14.2 years, 104 men) with preserved LV systolic function in whom 
subsequent echocardiographic data were obtained for a period of >1 year. HCM 
progressed to end-stage HCM in 13 patients (8.3%) of the 157 patients during a 
mean follow-up period of 6.3 ± 2.8 years. Compared with patients who did not 
reach end-stage HCM at the last evaluation, patients with progression to the 
end-stage phase had lower ejection fraction, larger LV size, more enlarged left 
atrial diameter, longer follow-up period, and higher frequency of an elevated 
concentration of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT; >0.014 ng/mL) at 
registration. Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated hs-cTnT was a 
significant predictor independent of lower LV ejection fraction for progression 
to end-stage HCM. Furthermore, in patients with elevated hs-cTnT levels, LV 
ejection fraction became significantly lower, LV end-diastolic diameter 
increased, and LV wall thickness decreased during the follow-up period, whereas 
those parameters did not change in the normal hs-cTnT group.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, an elevated hs-cTnT was associated with 
progression of LV remodelling, and this biomarker can be useful for predicting 
progression to the end-stage phase.

[The use of parnaparin sodium (Fluxum) in the prevention of thromboembolic 
complications after surgical treatment of fractures associated with high risks 
of thrombosis].

The need for thromboprophylaxis in traumatological and orthopedic operations is 
determined by a constant increase in the level of injuries of the population, 
and as a result, fluctuating coagulation indicators. Risk factors inherent in 
modern society that correlate primarily with reduced physical activity and 
excessive consumption of unbalanced (carbohydrate) nutrition, bad habits 
(nicotinism, alcoholism and other toxic dependencies), increased life expectancy 
and comorbidity - these and other causes can lead to an increase in the 
incidence of vascular accidents in patients with large limb bone fractures. The 
goal is to compare the effectiveness and clinical safety of using parnaparin 
sodium (Fluxum) and enoxaparin sodium as the prevention of thrombosis in the 
treatment of lower limb bone fractures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comparative assessment of the effectiveness and clinical 
safety of thrombosis prevention in the treatment of lower limb bone fractures 
using low-molecular weight heparins: parnaparin sodium (Fluxum) and enoxaparin 
sodium.
RESULTS: Taking into account the literature data on the significant risk of 
venous thromboembolic complications, we successfully conduct the 
thromboprophylaxis in patients with the traumatological and orthopedic profile, 
including in 2019 using the drug parnaparin sodium (Fluxum, «Alfasigma»). Our 
own comparative clinical experience has shown that with the convenience of 
taking enoxaparin sodium and the completeness of the scheme, the prevention of 
thrombosis with the use of parnaparin sodium shows the tendency to better 
clinical effectiveness and safety.
CONCLUSION: The choice of anticoagulants in traumatological and orthopedic 
practice, with obvious ease of use, provides the complete scheme for the 
prevention of thrombosis. Further research is needed on the routine use of 
sodium parnaparin in order to prevent thronbosis in the treatment of fractures 
of various localization.

Publisher: Актуальность тромбопрофилактики при травматолого-ортопедических 
операциях определена постоянным увеличением уровня травматизма населения, ростом 
наследственных и приобретенных тромбофилий, рядом прочих факторов и, как 
следствие, колеблющимися показателями коагуляции. Свойственные современному 
обществу факторы риска, коррелирующие прежде всего с пониженной физической 
активностью и избыточным потреблением несбалансированного (углеводного) питания, 
вредными привычками (никотинизм, алкоголизм и др.), увеличением 
продолжительности жизни и коморбидностью, могут привести к повышению 
встречаемости сосудистых катастроф у больных с переломами длинных костей 
конечностей.
ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Сравнить эффективность и клиническую безопасность применения 
парнапарина натрия (флюксум) и эноксапарина натрия в качестве профилактики 
тромбообразования при лечении переломов костей нижних конечностей.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Проведена сравнительная оценка эффективности и клинической 
безопасности профилактики тромбообразования при лечении переломов костей нижних 
конечностей с применением низкомолекулярных гепаринов: парнапарина натрия 
(флюксум) и эноксапарина натрия.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: С учетом данных литературы о значительном риске венозных 
тромбоэмболических осложнений нами успешно проводится тромбопрофилактика у 
пациентов травматолого-ортопедического профиля, в том числе с 2019 г. с 
использованием препарата парнапарина натрия (флюксум, Alfasigma). Собственный 
сравнительный клинический опыт продемонстрировал, что при сопоставимом с 
эноксапарином натрия удобстве приема и законченности схемы профилактика 
тромбообразования с применением исследуемого препарата демонстрирует тенденцию к 
лучшей клинической эффективности и безопасности.
ВЫВОДЫ: Применение парнапарина натрия на сравнительно небольшом пуле пациентов 
травматологического профиля продемонстрировало баланс эффективности и 
клинической безопасности профилактики тромбообразования при очевидном удобстве 
применения. В этой связи представляются обоснованными более масштабные 
исследования рутинного использования парнапарина натрия при лечении переломов 
различной локализации.

BACKGROUND: Positive peritoneal cytology (PCY) indicates metastasis (M1) in 
gastric cancer (GC) patients; both the American and Chinese guidelines recommend 
laparoscopic peritoneal lavage (LPL) for cytology. However, relatively high 
costs impair the widespread use of LPL in some resource-limited regions in 
China, and the cost-effectiveness of PCY testing remains unclear. Therefore, we 
performed a decision analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCY testing 
by comparing the guideline-recommended intraoperative LPL, a newly proposed 
preoperative percutaneous peritoneal lavage (PPL), and a third strategy of 
exploratory laparotomy with no cytology testing (ELNC) among GC patients.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic Markov model of the aforementioned 
three strategies for a hypothetical cohort of GC patients with curative intent 
after initial imaging, from the perspective of Chinese society. We estimated 
costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) as primary outcomes; we also conducted one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses to investigate the model's robustness.
RESULTS: We found that ELNC was dominated (i.e., more expensive and less 
effective) by PPL and LPL. LPL was the most cost-effective method with an ICER 
of US$17,200/QALY compared to PPL, which was below the Chinese 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$29,313 per QALY gained. In sensitivity 
analyses, PPL was more likely to be cost-effective with a lower WTP threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Cytology testing through either LPL or PPL was less expensive and 
more effective than ELNC among GC patients. Moreover, LPL was the most 
cost-effective modality at the current WTP threshold, while PPL could 
potentially be cost-effective in lower-income areas.

Neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM; MIM # 249400; ORPHA: 2481], first reported by the 
Bohemian pathologist Rokitansky in 1861, and now more precisely defined as 
neurocutaneous melanocytosis, is a rare, congenital syndrome characterised by 
the association of (1) congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) of the skin with 
overlying hypertrichosis, presenting as (a) large (LCMN) or giant and/or 
multiple (MCMN) melanocytic lesions (or both; sometimes associated with smaller 
"satellite" nevi) or (b) as proliferative melanocytic nodules; and (2) 
melanocytosis (with infiltration) of the brain parenchyma and/or leptomeninges. 
CMN of the skin and leptomeningeal/nervous system infiltration are usually 
benign, more rarely may progress to melanoma or non-malignant melanosis of the 
brain. Approximately 12% of individuals with LCMN will develop NCM: wide 
extension and/or dorsal axial distribution of LCMN increases the risk of NCM. 
The CMN are recognised at birth and are distributed over the skin according to 6 
or more patterns (6B patterns) in line with the archetypical patterns of 
distribution of mosaic skin disorders. Neurological manifestations can appear 
acutely in infancy, or more frequently later in childhood or adult life, and 
include signs/symptoms of intracranial hypertension, seizures/epilepsy, cranial 
nerve palsies, motor/sensory deficits, cognitive/behavioural abnormalities, 
sleep cycle anomalies, and eventually neurological deterioration. NMC patients 
may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, with or without evidence of the typical 
nervous system changes at MRI. Associated brain and spinal cord malformations 
include the Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) complex, hemimegalencephaly, 
cortical dysplasia, arachnoid cysts, Chiari I and II malformations, 
syringomyelia, meningoceles, occult spinal dysraphism, and CNS 
lipoma/lipomatosis. There is no systemic involvement, or only rarely. 
Pathogenically, single postzygotic mutations in the NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS 
viral oncogene homologue; MIM # 164790; at 1p13.2) proto-oncogene explain the 
occurrence of single/multiple CMNs and melanocytic and non-melanocytic nervous 
system lesions in NCM: these disrupt the RAS/ERK/mTOR/PI3K/akt pathways. 
Diagnostic/surveillance work-ups require physical examination, ophthalmoscopy, 
brain/spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA), 
positron emission tomography (PET), and video-EEG and IQ testing. Treatment 
strategies include laser therapy, chemical peeling, dermabrasion, and surgical 
removal/grafting for CMNs and shunt surgery and surgical 
removal/chemo/radiotherapy for CNS lesions. Biologically targeted therapies 
tailored (a) BRAF/MEK in NCM mice (MEK162) and GCMN (trametinib); (b) PI3K/mTOR 
(omipalisib/GSK2126458) in NMC cells; (c) RAS/MEK (vemurafenib and trametinib) 
in LCMNs cells; or created experimental NMC cells (YP-MEL).

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurological 
disorder with a high psychosocial and economic burden. As part of the European 
Brain Council (EBC)-led Value of Treatment project, this study aimed to capture 
the economic benefit of timely, adequate, and adherence to PD treatment.
METHODS: The EBC Value of Treatment Initiative combined different stakeholders 
to identify unmet needs in the patients' journey according to Rotterdam 
methodology. The economic evaluation focused on three major topics identified as 
major gaps: start of treatment; best treatment for advanced disease; and 
adherence to treatment. Two separate healthcare systems (Germany and the UK) 
were chosen. Cost-effectiveness was determined by using decision-analytical 
modelling approaches. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Treatment intervention in PD was found to be cost-effective regardless 
of the initial health state of the patient receiving the treatment. Cost savings 
were between -€1000 and -€5400 with 0.10 QALY gain and -€1800 and -€7600 with 
0.10 QALY gain for Germany and the UK, respectively. Treatment remains 
cost-effective within the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
thresholds. Availability of adequate treatment to more patients was also found 
to be cost-effective, with an ICER of €15,000-€32,600 across country settings. 
Achieving the target adherence to treatment would generate cost-savings of 
€239,000-€576,000 (Germany) and €917,000-€2,980.000 (UK) for every 1,000 
patients treated adequately.
CONCLUSIONS: The analyses confirmed that timely, adequate, and adherence to PD 
treatment will not only improve care of the patients but is also cost-effective 
across healthcare systems. Further studies with a distinct identification of 
gaps in care are necessary to develop better and affordable care.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is considered to be a promising peptide for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the extremely short 
half-life of GLP-1 limits its clinical application. Albumin-binding domain (ABD) 
with high affinity for human serum albumin (HSA) has been used widely for 
half-life extension of therapeutic peptides and proteins. In the present study, 
novel GLP-1 receptor agonists were designed by genetic fusion of GLP-1 to three 
kinds of ABDs with different affinities for HSA: GA3, ABD035 and ABDCon. The 
bioactivities and half-lives of ABD-fusion GLP-1 proteins with different types 
and lengths of linkers were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results 
demonstrated that ABD-fusion GLP-1 proteins could bind to HSA with high 
affinity. The blood glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1 was significantly improved 
and sustained by fusion to ABD. Meanwhile, the fusion proteins significantly 
inhibited food intake, which was beneficial for T2DM and obesity treatment. The 
half-life of GLP-1 was substantially extended by virtue of ABD. The in vivo 
results also showed that a longer linker inserted between GLP-1 and ABD resulted 
in a higher blood glucose-lowering effect. The fusion proteins generated by 
fusion of GLP-1 to GA3, ABD035 and ABDCon exhibited similar bioactivities and 
pharmacokinetics in vivo. These findings demonstrate that ABD-fusion GLP-1 
proteins retain the bioactivities of natural GLP-1 and can be further developed 
for T2DM treatment and weight loss. It also indicates that the ABD-fusion 
strategy can be generally applicable to any peptide or protein, to improve 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties.

Antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV can achieve potent, long-term 
suppression of HIV plasma viremia and has increased life expectancy. The central 
nervous system is infected early after virus acquisition and remains a reservoir 
for HIV. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are an end-organ 
manifestation of HIV infection. The need to address neurological complications 
caused by HAND is significant as approximately 50% of people living with HIV on 
suppressive antiretroviral therapy are estimated to have some form of HAND. This 
review discusses the pathophysiology of HAND, CSF/CNS penetration and clinical 
pharmacology of antiretrovirals including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
relationships, the persistence of HIV in the brain, and future therapeutic 
approaches to preserve and improve sustained viral suppression in the brain.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Hemoglobinopathies.

Yesilipek MA(1).

Author information:

Unit, Medicalpark Antalya Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.

Hemoglobinopathies are the most common single-gene diseases and are estimated to 
affect millions of people worldwide. Thalassemia and sickle cell disease are the 
most prevalent diseases of this group. Today, despite the decreasing number of 
newborns diagnosed with a hemoglobinopathy, it remains an important health 
problem for many countries. Although regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, 
advanced iron chelation, and supportive therapy alternatives have improved life 
expectancy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the 
only curative option for patients with hemoglobinopathies to prevent 
irreversible organ damage. Modern transplantation approaches and careful 
posttransplantation follow-up of patients have improved survival outcomes, and 
HSCT has now been performed in several patients with hemoglobinopathies 
worldwide. Considering current experiences, hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation is recommended in cases of β-thalassemia (β-thal) in the 
presence of a matched family or unrelated donor, without secondary organ damage 
due to transfusion. In patients with sickle cell anemia, transplantation 
indications include transfusion dependence and cases of secondary organ damage. 
Recently, gene therapy as a possible treatment option has yielded promising 
results, though it is not in routine clinical use at its current stage.

INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the
