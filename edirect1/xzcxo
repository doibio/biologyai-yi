In Japan, 1.5-2 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection. New direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) offer an unprecedented 
opportunity to cure HCV. While the price of HCV treatment decreased recently in 
most countries, it remains one of the highest in Japan. Our objective was to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment in patients of different age 
groups and to estimate the price at which DAAs become cost-saving in Japan. A 
previously developed microsimulation model was adapted to the Japanese 
population and updated with Japan-specific health utilities and costs. Our model 
showed that compared with no treatment, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of DAAs at a price USD 41,046 per treatment was USD 9,080 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 60-year-old patients. HCV treatment 
became cost-effective after 9 years of starting treatment. However, if the price 
of DAAs is reduced by 55-85% (USD 6,730 to 17,720), HCV treatment would be 
cost-saving within a 5 to 20-year time horizon, which should serve to increase 
the uptake of DAA-based HCV treatment. The payers of health care in Japan could 
examine ways to procure DAAs at a price where they would be cost-saving.

Primary Metabolism in Fresh Fruits During Storage.

The extension of commercial life and the reduction of postharvest losses of 
perishable fruits is mainly based on storage at low temperatures alone or in 
combination with modified atmospheres (MAs) and controlled atmospheres (CAs), 
directed primarily at reducing their overall metabolism thus delaying ripening 
and senescence. Fruits react to postharvest conditions with desirable changes if 
appropriate protocols are applied, but otherwise can develop negative and 
unacceptable traits due to the onset of physiological disorders. Extended cold 
storage periods and/or inappropriate temperatures can result in development of 
chilling injuries (CIs). The etiology, incidence, and severity of such symptoms 
vary even within cultivars of the same species, indicating the genotype 
significance. Carbohydrates and amino acids have protective/regulating roles in 
CI development. MA/CA storage protocols involve storage under hypoxic conditions 
and high carbon dioxide concentrations that can maximize quality over extended 
storage periods but are also affected by the cultivar, exposure time, and 
storage temperatures. Pyruvate metabolism is highly reactive to changes in 
oxygen concentration and is greatly affected by the shift from aerobic to 
anaerobic metabolism. Ethylene-induced changes in fruits can also have 
deleterious effects under cold storage and MA/CA conditions, affecting 
susceptibility to chilling and carbon dioxide injuries. The availability of the 
inhibitor of ethylene perception 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) has not only 
resulted in development of a new technology but has also been used to increase 
understanding of the role of ethylene in ripening of both non-climacteric and 
climacteric fruits. Temperature, MA/CA, and 1-MCP alter fruit physiology and 
biochemistry, resulting in compositional changes in carbon- and nitrogen-related 
metabolisms and compounds. Successful application of these storage technologies 
to fruits must consider their effects on the metabolism of carbohydrates, 
organic acids, amino acids and lipids.

Immuno-DNA binding directed template-free DNA extension and enzyme catalysis for 
sensitive electrochemical DNA methyltransferase activity assay and inhibitor 
screening.

Sensitive and accurate determination of DNA methyltransferase (DNA Mtase) 
activity is highly pursued for understanding fundamental biological processes 
related to DNA methylation, clinical disease diagnosis and drug discovery. 
Herein, we propose a new electrochemical immuno-DNA sensing platform for DNA 
Mtase activity assay and inhibitor screening. After homogeneous DNA methylation 
by CpG methyltransferase (M.SssI Mtase), the methylated DNA can be specifically 
recruited onto an electrode via its immunological binding with the immobilized 
anti-5-methylcytosine antibody. The recruited methylated DNA was simultaneously 
used as a substrate to facilitate successive template-free DNA extension and 
enzyme catalysis for the dual-step signal amplification of DNA Mtase activity. 
The developed immuno-DNA sensing strategy effectively integrates solution-phase 
DNA methylation, surface affinity binding recognition, and successive 
template-free DNA extension and enzyme catalysis-based signal amplification, 
rendering a highly specific, sensitive and accurate assay of DNA Mtase activity. 
A low detection limit of 0.039 U mL-1 could be achieved with a high selectivity. 
It was also applied for efficient evaluation of various inhibitors. Current 
affinity recognition of the immobilized antibody with methylated DNA switches 
the sensing platform into a DNA operation interface, facilitating the 
opportunity for combining various DNA-based signal amplification strategies to 
improve the detection performance. It would be used as a general strategy for 
the analysis of DNA Mtase activity, inhibitors and more analytes, and is 
anticipated to show potential for applications in disease diagnosis and drug 
discovery.

INTRODUCTION: Plant-based diets are associated with a lower: (i) body mass 
index, (ii) rates of death from ischemic heart disease, (iii) serum cholesterol, 
(iv) incidence of high blood pressure, (v) type II diabetes mellitus and cancer, 
with an overall longer life expectancy. However, little data concerning the oral 
health in individuals on a plant-based diet are available.
AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the general and clinical 
oral health status in a cohort of adults who had been following a plant-based 
diet for a minimum of 24 months.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: For this purpose, individuals were administered two 
questionnaires (a.Questionnaire investigating risk areas for oral diseases; b. 
Italian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile -14 (IOHIP-14)) by a dental 
hygienist and clinical examination of the oral cavity was carried out.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven adult individuals were enrolled. On average, they 
followed a plant-based diet for the last four years, had four meals a day and 
brushed their teeth twice a day. Fruit was the most frequently consumed food at 
breakfast by 48 of the participants. Thirty-four responders did not drink beer 
or wine, 65 did not drink spirits, 57 avoided carbonated beverages and 62 
(80.5%) did not consume any highly-sugared beverages. Different dental therapies 
in the previous three years were reported in 36 of the responders. Overall, 
answers "never and almost never" to the IOHIP-14 questionnaire were observed in 
87% to 100% of the individuals. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed 
that fresh fruit consumption at lunch had a protective effect against caries 
(p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study showed that individuals on a plant-based 
diet have good overall oral health conditions. These features are in agreement 
with the behavior of these subjects towards an overall healthy life style.

BACKGROUND: It is important to identify variables that influence life expectancy 
in order to develop strategies to improve health care systems and thereby 
increase life expectancy.
AIMS: In this study, a decision tree was built using a chi-square automatic 
interaction detector technique in order to identify variables influencing life 
expectancy at birth.
METHODS: Data were taken from the databases of the World Bank, World Health 
Organization and World Life Expectancy. Data from 166 countries for the year 
2013 were extracted for 25 selected input variables related to mortality, health 
and the environment, child health, economy and demography in order to build the 
decision tree.
RESULTS: Of the 25 variables, nine had a significant influence on life 
expectancy: percentage of the population using improved sanitation facilities; 
death rates per 100 000 population for HIV/AIDS, liver disease, stroke and 
coronary heart disease; percentage of the urban population using improved 
drinking-water sources; total fertility rate (births per woman); public health 
expenditure (percent of government expenditure); and health expenditure per 
capita.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving these variables may result in significant increases in 
life expectancy and quality of life. At the country level, appropriate 
strategies can be developed to improve the quality and performance of health 
care systems.

BACKGROUND: Child mortality rates are considered to be one of the key indicators 
of child health.
AIMS: The main objective of this research was to calculate child mortality rates 
(CMRs) indirectly, using census data, and to investigate using spatial pattern 
analysis the presence of any clustering patterns among provincial regions.
METHODS: The Trussell version of the Brass method and Coale-Demeny West model 
were used to estimate CMRs and life expectancy (LE) at birth. The analyses were 
performed using the QFive program of MORTPAK 4 software. For cluster analysis, 
local and global Moran's I indexes were measured.
RESULTS: Infant mortality rate, under-5 mortality rate, 1-4 mortality rate and 
LE at birth were estimated as 21.9, 26, 4.1 (deaths per 1000 live births) and 
72.1 years, respectively. Global Moran's I index was calculated as 0.09, 0.09, 
0.08 and 0.12, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Special attention must be paid in provinces with high clusters 
regarding the evaluation of public health programmes, and the cause of failure 
of these programmes in reduction of childhood mortality indices.

Life expectancy at a given age is a summary measure of mortality rates present 
in a population (estimated as the area under the survival curve), and represents 
the average number of years an individual at that age is expected to live if 
current age-specific mortality rates apply now and in the future. A 
complementary metric is the number of Life Years Lost, which is used to measure 
the reduction in life expectancy for a specific group of persons, for example 
those diagnosed with a specific disease or condition (e.g. smoking). However, 
calculation of life expectancy among those with a specific disease is not 
straightforward for diseases that are not present at birth, and previous studies 
have considered a fixed age at onset of the disease, e.g. at age 15 or 20 years. 
In this paper, we present the R package lillies (freely available through the 
Comprehensive R Archive Network; CRAN) to guide the reader on how to implement a 
recently-introduced method to estimate excess Life Years Lost associated with a 
disease or condition that overcomes these limitations. In addition, we show how 
to decompose the total number of Life Years Lost into specific causes of death 
through a competing risks model, and how to calculate confidence intervals for 
the estimates using non-parametric bootstrap. We provide a description on how to 
use the method when the researcher has access to individual-level data (e.g. 
electronic healthcare and mortality records) and when only aggregated-level data 
are available.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have transformed conventional drug 
discovery pathways in recent years. In particular, recent advances in hiPSC 
biology, including organoid technologies, have highlighted a new potential for 
neural drug discovery with clear advantages over the use of primary tissues. 
This is important considering the financial and social burden of neurological 
health care worldwide, directly impacting the life expectancy of many 
populations. Patient-derived iPSCs-neurons are invaluable tools for novel 
drug-screening and precision medicine approaches directly aimed at reducing the 
burden imposed by the increasing prevalence of neurological disorders in an 
aging population. 3-Dimensional self-assembled or so-called 'organoid' hiPSCs 
cultures offer key advantages over traditional 2D ones and may well be 
gamechangers in the drug-discovery quest for neurological disorders in the 
coming years.

BACKGROUND: Physical multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more 
chronic physical conditions, is widespread and reduces life expectancy and 
quality of life in older adults. Sedentary behavior (SB) is increasingly 
identified as a risk factor for a range of chronic physical conditions, 
independent of physical activity.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between physical multimorbidity and SB 
in older adults.
STUDY DESIGN: We used cross-sectional data from a population-based sample of 
6903 adults aged â¥50 years who participated in the Irish Longitudinal Study on 
Ageing (TILDA) in 2009-2011. We conducted multivariable linear and logistic 
regression analyses to assess associations between multimorbidity and SB.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported minutes/day of SB and high SB (â¥ 8â¯h/day).
RESULTS: We found that most of the 14 individual chronic physical conditions 
included here were associated with greater SB. Those with stroke (ORâ¯=â¯2.63, 95 
% CIâ¯=â¯1.69, 4.10) and cirrhosis (ORâ¯=â¯2.53, 95 %CIâ¯=â¯1.19, 5.41) were the most 
likely to be classified with high SB. Time spent in SB and the prevalence of 
high SB increased linearly with number of chronic conditions. Multivariable 
regression models adjusting for sociodemographic and psychological factors, 
disability, social network, and physical activity showed that, compared with 
people with none, those with â¥4 chronic physical conditions had 1.45 times 
greater odds (ORâ¯=â¯1.45, 95 % CIâ¯=â¯1.09, 1.93) of high SB and higher mean 
minutes/day of SB (Î²â¯=â¯21.37, 95 % CIâ¯=â¯5.53, 37.20).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that physical multimorbidity is associated with 
SB and highlight the need for prospective research to examine the directionality 
and mechanisms of these associations.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence of malnutrition is over 70% in advanced 
cancer patients and impacts negatively on survival and quality of life. 
Artificial nutrition can be integrated into a home palliative care program. This 
observational study aims to describe the criteria for identifying the cancer 
patients that could benefit from home artificial nutrition (HAN) and to evaluate 
its impact on survival and performance status.
METHODS: The selection criteria for patient's eligibility to HAN were: Karnofsky 
Performance Status (KPS) â¥40, life expectancy â¥6 weeks, inadequate caloric 
intakeÂ Â±Â malnutrition, suitable psycho-physical conditions and informed consent. 
The access route for nutritional therapy (home parenteral nutrition, HPN; home 
enteral nutrition, HEN) was chosen according to the ESPEN Guidelines. The 
parameters considered were: primary site of the tumor; oral food intake; 
nutritional status; stage of cachexia; fluid, energy and protein supplied by 
HAN; survival.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, 43,474 cancer patients were assisted at home in 
Bologna (Italy). HAN started in 969 patients (2.2% of total patients, 571 men 
and 398 women, mean age 65.7Â Â±Â 12.7 years): HPN in 629 patients (64.9%), with 
gastrointestinal obstruction as the main indication; HEN in 340 patients 
(35.1%), with dysphagia as the main indication. Considering the 890 deceased 
patients, the mean survival after the start of HAN was 18.3 weeks and 649 
patients (72.9%) survived more than 6 weeks. The mean survival was higher in HEN 
(22.1 weeks) compared to HPN patients (16.1 weeks) (pÂ <Â .001). After one month, 
KPS was unchanged in 649 (67.0%), increased in 232 (23.9%) and decreased in 88 
patients (9.1%). The mean KPS increased in patients starting HAN in pre-cachexia 
and cachexia (pÂ <Â .001). Cachexia and refractory cachexia at the entry were 
associated with a reduced survival [odds ratio: 1.5 and 2.3 respectively, 
pÂ <Â .001 for both condition] respect to pre-cachexia.
CONCLUSIONS: The selection criteria allow the identification of the patient who 
can take advantage of HAN. HAN can be effective in avoiding death from 
malnutrition in 73% of patients, and in maintaining or improving the KPS at one 
month in 90% of cases. The benefits provided by HAN on survival and performance 
status depend on the cachexia degree at the entry.

OBJECTIVES: Studies examining the effects of statins after acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) excluded frail older adults, especially nursing home (NH) 
residents, and few examined functional outcomes. Older NH residents may benefit 
less from statins and be particularly susceptible to adverse drug events like 
myopathy-related functional decline. We evaluated the effects of statins on 
1-year functional decline, rehospitalization, and death in NH residents.
DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 2007-2010 linked 
national data from Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessments, Medicare claims, and 
Online Survey Certification and Reporting System records.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We included US NH residents 65Â years and older who 
were statin nonusers, were hospitalized for AMI between May 2007 and March 2010, 
and returned to the NH.
MEASURES: Outcomes were functional decline, death, and rehospitalization in the 
first year after post-AMI NH admission. New statin users were 1:1 
propensity-score matched to nonusers to adjust for 92 characteristics. We 
estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and restricted mean survival time differences with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing individuals who did vs did not initiate 
statin therapy after AMI hospitalization.
RESULTS: Propensity-score matching yielded a cohort of 5440 residents. Mean age 
was 83Â years and 69% were female. Statin use was associated with a reduction in 
mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87), corresponding to a mean of 15.9 (95% CI 
9.9-22.0) days of extended life expectancy. No overall differences in 
rehospitalization (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98-1.14) or functional decline (HR 1.00, 
95% CI 0.88-1.14) were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Statins may reduce 1-year mortality by 20% without 
affecting function among older NH residents who wish to live longer after AMI. 
During shared decision making with these patients or their representatives, 
clinicians should consider communicating that the average benefit of statins is 
16Â days of additional survival over 1Â year.

To better understand how associated microorganisms ("microbiota") influence 
organismal aging, we focused on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster We 
conducted a metagenome-wide association (MGWA) as a screen to identify bacterial 
genes associated with variation in the D. melanogaster life span. The results of 
the MGWA predicted that bacterial cysteine and methionine metabolism genes 
influence fruit fly longevity. A mutant analysis, in which flies were inoculated 
with Escherichia coli strains bearing mutations in various methionine cycle 
genes, confirmed a role for some methionine cycle genes in extending or 
shortening fruit fly life span. Initially, we predicted these genes might 
influence longevity by mimicking or opposing methionine restriction, an 
established mechanism for life span extension in fruit flies. However, follow-up 
transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolomic experiments were generally 
inconsistent with this conclusion and instead implicated glucose and vitamin B6 
metabolism in these influences. We then tested if bacteria could influence life 
span through methionine restriction using a different set of bacterial strains. 
Flies reared with a bacterial strain that ectopically expressed bacterial 
transsulfuration genes and lowered the methionine content of the fly diet also 
extended female D. melanogaster life span. Taken together, the microbial 
influences shown here overlap with established host genetic mechanisms for aging 
and therefore suggest overlapping roles for host and microbial metabolism genes 
in organismal aging.IMPORTANCE Associated microorganisms ("microbiota") are 
intimately connected to the behavior and physiology of their animal hosts, and 
defining the mechanisms of these interactions is an urgent imperative. This 
study focuses on how microorganisms influence the life span of a model host, the 
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster First, we performed a screen that suggested a 
strong influence of bacterial methionine metabolism on host life span. Follow-up 
analyses of gene expression and metabolite abundance identified stronger roles 
for vitamin B6 and glucose than methionine metabolism among the tested mutants, 
possibly suggesting a more limited role for bacterial methionine metabolism 
genes in host life span effects. In a parallel set of experiments, we created a 
distinct bacterial strain that expressed life span-extending methionine 
metabolism genes and showed that this strain can extend fly life span. 
Therefore, this work identifies specific bacterial genes that influence host 
life span, including in ways that are consistent with the expectations of 
methionine restriction.

Efforts to reduce smoking at the Olympics that will be hosted in Tokyo in 2020 
are spreading across the country, but they are not enough. In general, it is 
said that (1) smoke prevention education for minors, (2) smoking cessation 
support for smokers, and (3) smoking restriction in the social environment are 
necessary to reduce the smoking rate. Healthy Japan 21 called for achieving a 
numerical target for the reduction of youth smoking by 2010. The author is a 
principal school doctor at Hamamatsu Municipal Yuto Elementary School and has 
been teaching antismoking classes to elementary school students since 1999. In 
this area (Yuto District, Hamamatsu City in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan), there 
is the Oki-jinja Shrine, which was built in 705, and a large event (Oki-jinja 
grand festival) is held there each autumn, attracting 2500 people. Since many 
people gather there, it is worthwhile to provide information about passive 
smoking prevention on shrine grounds. Since 1999, smoking prevention classes 
have been held at elementary schools, and in 2008, smoking was prohibited in the 
grounds of the Oki-jinja Shrine, making the festival there totally nonsmoking 
within the shrine grounds, among additional measures taken against smoking. In 
addition, measures against smoking at large events in Shizuoka Prefecture and 
Hamamatsu City have also been effective, and the smoking rate among Hamamatsu 
citizens has dropped to 10.2% (From Health Promotion Division, Hamamatsu City, 
2016), which is expected to extend their healthy life expectancy. To reduce the 
smoking rate, it is important not only to provide administrative support but 
also to engage in steady civic activities.

The ability to positively alter immune and stress response with nutritional 
compounds is of great interest and importance to the beef industry. There is a 
proprietary product (OmniGen-AF [OG]; Phibro Animal Health, Quincy, IL) reported 
to have performance-enhancing benefits by altering animal response to stress and 
immune challenges. The objective of this 2-yr research project was to study the 
effect of supplementing OG to beef cows and their calves on breeding and growth 
performance. One hundred and twelve multiparous beef cows and 48 primiparous 
cows were randomly assigned to treatment in year 1; control (CON, no OG; n = 56 
multiparous and 24 primiparous) or treatment (OG fed at 8.8 g/100 kg body weight 
[BW]; n = 56 multiparous and 24 primiparous). Multiparous cows (mean Â± SD = 6.4 
Â± 0.4 yr; BW = 589 Â± 9.2 kg; body condition score [BCS] 6.2 Â± 0.07) were used in 
both years of the experiment and primiparous cows (mean Â± SD = 2.1 Â± 0.04 yr of 
age, weighed 400 Â± 7.5 kg, and BSC of 5.6 Â± 0.06) were only used in the first 
year of the experiment. CON and OG supplements were offered over two production 
cycles beginning in December approximately 60 d prior to projected calving 
through pre-breeding in May of each year. Calves from treatment cows were 
offered treatments in a creep supplement limited to a daily rate of 1% as-fed of 
BW prorated for 3-d/wk feeding from mid-July through weaning with OG offered at 
8.8 g/100 kg BW. Primiparous cow's BW, BCS, and calf performance were not 
affected by treatment (P â¥ 0.15) in year 1. BW of multiparous OG cows tended (P 
= 0.10) to be heavier at weaning in year 1 and was greater (P = 0.05) at the 
onset of the experiment in year 2. Body condition of OG cows was greater (P â¤ 
0.02) at weaning in both years 1 and 2, as well as at the onset of the 
experiment in year 2. Calves fed OG from the mature cows gained more (P = 0.05) 
BW during the creep feeding period than CON. Core body temperatures of OG 
heifers measured during the late summer with intravaginal temperature data 
loggers tended (P â¤ 0.10) to be less at 1400 and 1700 hours and were less (P = 
0.05) at 1800 hours than CON heifers. Feeding OG did not result in changes (P = 
0.25) in serum titer response to the BVD virus of calves during year 2. The 
results of the current experiment indicate feeding OG to beef cows and calves 
can result in improvement in BCS of cows, enhance weight gain of calves 
preweaning, and reduce heat loads in heifer calves during the late summer.

Telomere dysfunction and changes in their length during aging of an organism is 
a reflection of more global processes in the genome, which are caused by the 
regulatory influence of transposable elements sequentially activated during 
ontogenesis. This consequence is due to the fact that centromeres and 
centromeric proteins, telomeres and telomerases, introns and spliceosome 
components, transcription factors and their binding sites, noncoding RNAs and 
their targets in protein coding gene sequences have evolved from transposable 
elements. The relationship of these structural-functional elements of the genome 
dynamically changes in individual development and depends on the characteristics 
of successive activations and transpositions of the transposable elements. Each 
species is characterized by a specific set of transposable elements and 
associated tandem repeats, which affects the epigenetic regulation of 
ontogenesis. These tandem repeats are mainly contained in centromeres and 
telomeres, the specific influence of researchers on which is promising for 
developing ways of regulating life expectancy. This is due to the ability of 
ribozymes and peptides to interact with specific DNA nucleotide sequences, 
especially as part of tandem repeats. An important approach to the study of the 
relationship of transposons with telomeres, centromeres and subtelomeric regions 
for the regulation of aging can be the study of the role of their uniting 
peptides and miRNA, whose complex application has a high potential of 
geroprotective efficiency.

The steady tendency of modernity improve the average life expectancy of a man 
dictates the necessity of implementing the anti-aging stratege, one of the 
stratege for women is menopausal therapy. Currently, the protective effect of 
menopausal therapy for cardiovascular system has been proven up to 60 years 
after it's implication in treatment. MHT is rarely used in Russia, largely due 
to the hormonophobia of patients and doctors especially with oncological risk. 
In contrary, recent studies indicate prolonged use of MHT decrease the risk of 
breast, ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancer. Morden microdosed medications 
that include dydrogesteron and progesterone as a progestational agent, also 
minimize the risk. Currently, there are no restictions on the duration of 
appucation. Total mortality decrease by 30% based on the result of meta-analysis 
23 studies, which involve 39 049 people age until 60 years old with menopausal 
therapy.

Albumin accumulation in tumours could reflect a role of albumin in transport of 
endogenous nutrient cargos required for cellular growth and not just a suggested 
source of amino acids; a role driven by albumin engagement with its cognate 
cellular recycling neonatal Fc receptor. We investigate the hypothesis that 
albumin cellular recruitment is increased by higher human FcRn (hFcRn) 
expression in human cancer tissue that provides the mechanistic basis for 
exploitation in albumin-based drug designs engineered to optimise this process. 
Eight out of ten different human cancer tissue types screened for hFcRn 
expression by immunohistochemistry (310 samples) exhibited significantly higher 
hFcRn expression compared to healthy tissues. Accelerated tumour growth over 
28Â days in mice inoculated with hFcRn-expressing HT-29 human colorectal cancer 
cell xenografts, compared to CRISPR/Cas9 hFcRn-knockout HT-29, suggests a 
hFcRn-mediated tumour growth effect. Direct correlation between hFcRn expression 
and albumin recycling supports hFcRn-mediated diversion of albumin from 
lysosomal degradation. Two-fold increase in accumulation of fluorescent labelled 
high-binding hFcRn albumin, compared to wild type albumin, in luciferase 
MDA-MB-231-Luc-D3H2LN breast cancer xenografts was shown. This work identifies 
overexpression of hFcRn in several human cancer types with mechanistic data 
suggesting hFcRn-driven albumin recruitment for increased cellular growth that 
has the potential to be exploited with high hFcRn-binding albumin variants for 
targeted therapies.
