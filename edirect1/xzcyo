illustration. It contrasts these with arguments favoring age discrimination 
toward older people in high-income, more industrialized countries of the global 
North, particularly the United States and United Kingdom. Finally, it considers 
what role, if any, differences in life expectancy, infant and child mortality, 
and prospects for healthy lives should play in the moral embrace of a particular 
view by a community. It argues that there can be reasons to favor different 
types of discrimination in different parts of the world.

Aim A request was made to the Department of Public Health in early 2019 for some 
interesting statistics (funtistics) for a planned health promotion campaign 
encouraging public transport users to increase their physical activity levels by 
alighting one stop earlier and walking to their destination. For a novel 
presentation of the benefits of increasing physical activity it was decided to 
calculate the potential increase in life-expectancy that a given amount of 
physical activity would correspond to (at a population level). Method Estimated 
increase in weekly walking time was calculated for the Dublin Bus commuter 
walking the last stop of their journey. The reduced risk of mortality was 
estimated for this increase in physical activity and applied to Irish life 
tables to calculate change in life expectancy. Results Alighting from a bus one 
stop earlier in Dublin would lead to an average of 4.42 minutes additional 
walking (44.21 minutes additional walking per week for a commuter). In the 
Dublin Bus commuter population, this leads to an estimated 50 day increase in 
life expectancy (male population). Conclusion At the lower end of the dose 
response curve for physical activity, health benefits include: reduced risk of 
cardiovascular disease, reduced risk of diabetes, psychosocial benefit, reduced 
risk of musculoskeletal problems. For the prevention of weight gain and some 
cancers, activity at the upper end of the range (1000 MET.min/week, 
approximately 300 minutes of walking/week) is thought to be required.

BACKGROUND: Patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) have a good life 
expectancy due to early therapeutic options, such as stem cell therapy. Stem 
cell therapy can prevent the progression of some skeletal malformations. In 
contrast, the progression of thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, genua vara, and hip 
dysplasia cannot be influenced. We present 3 cases of children with MPS I with 
thoracolumbar kyphosis/kyphoscoliosis treated with a growing rod system.
CASE DESCRIPTION: The medical records and radiologic imaging of 3 children with 
a diagnosis of MPS I and kyphosis/kyphoscoliosis of the lumbar spine treated 
between 2007 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Two children presented with 
a kyphoscoliosis, and 1 child had a combination of severe anterolisthesis and 
kyphoscoliosis. Surgery to correct the kyphosis and dorsal stabilization was 
performed in all patients after exhausted conservative treatment. There were no 
neurologic complications. Postoperative treatment and aftercare included a 
corset for 4 months and physical therapy. In all 3 patients, distraction surgery 
of the lumbar stabilization was done twice at a mean interval of 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: If conservative treatment fails and surgery is necessary, an 
individual approach is needed. Dorsal stabilization with pedicle screws using a 
growing rod technique is an option for the correction of thoracolumbar/lumbar 
kyphosis in children with MPS I. However, fusion should be prevented initially 
or should be kept as short as possible. We achieved acceptable correction of the 
spinal deformity using the growing rod technique. Finally, surgery with 
correction and fusion is necessary after exhausted correction potential.

Palliative medicine is specialized medical care for people with serious illness. 
Serious illness is one with high risk of mortality that negatively affects 
quality of life or function or is burdensome in symptoms, treatments, or 
caregiver stress. Palliative care improves symptom management and addresses the 
needs of patients and families, resulting in improved patient and caregiver 
quality of life and reduced symptom burden and health care utilization. Hospice 
is palliative care for patients with a prognosis of 6 months or less and is 
appropriate when goals are to avoid hospitalization and maximize time at home 
for patients who are dying.

Prognostication is a vital aspect of decision making because it provides 
patients and families with information to establish realistic and achievable 
goals of care, is used in determining eligibility for certain benefits, and 
helps in targeting interventions to those likely to benefit. Prognostication 
consists of 3 components: clinicians use their clinical judgment or other tools 
to estimate the probability of an individual developing a particular outcome 
over a specific period of time; this prognostic estimate is communicated in 
accordance with the patient's information preferences; the prognostic estimate 
is interpreted by the patient or surrogate and used in clinical decision making.

STAT3 plays an important role in regulating gene expression and is closely 
related with cancer. Thus, the sensitive and specific detection of the STAT3 
biomarker is of great importance for disease diagnosis and therapeutics. In this 
study, by combining the target recycling amplification (TRA) with strand 
displacement amplification (SDA), we have developed a label-free and highly 
sensitive method for the dual-amplified detection of STAT3. The assay system 
consists of polymerization primer and label-free hairpin probe (HP) containing 
palindromic fragment and nicking site. In the presence of STAT3, the stem of the 
HP is opened, followed by the primer binding to initiate TRA and SDA with the 
help of Klenow Fragment (KF) and nickase. After multiple replication, nicking, 
and strand displacement, STAT3 was released and initiated the next round of 
reactions, generating a large number of terminal palindrome-contained fragments. 
Subsequently, the intermolecular hybridization between palindromic fragments 
occurred and the bidirectional extension by polymerase takes place, forming the 
dsDNAs. The double-stranded DNA products can be quantified by measuring the 
fluorescence intensity of SYBR Green I. The proposed strategy shows the 
excellent specificity and high sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 50 
pM. In addition, this designed protocol can be successfully applied to detect 
the STAT3 in human serum, indicating great potential for the practical 
application in early diagnosis and prognosis.

More than a decade ago Singer (2009) described Gibraltar's experience with 
cholera and smallpox in 1865 as a syndemic. In this study, we provide a 
reassessment of that event and, consequently, propose a methodology to identify 
a syndemic at the population level. We propose that the concept of the 
harvesting effect from demographic studies on crisis mortality provides a useful 
framework for evaluating the presence of a syndemic. Our research begins by 
establishing a normative baseline mortality (BM) through life table analysis, 
where changes in life expectancy (LE) around BM can be used to show a 
distinctive pattern of significant decline and increase. Such was the case with 
the presence of both cholera and smallpox in the fall of 1865, when LE fell 
significantly to 19.64 years from the background LE of 32.88 years. A year 
later, this decline was followed by a significant increase in LE to 41.34 years. 
Excessive mortality followed by a fallow (healthy) period represents a signature 
feature of a syndemic driven by a short-term infectious disease epidemic. The 
presence of both cholera and smallpox in 1860 did not produce similar results, 
evidence which suggests that the presence of two infectious epidemics in an 
impoverished population was not sufficient to produce a syndemic. The presence 
of a protracted state of quarantine, with its concomitant social and economic 
consequences, was a driving force responsible for amplifying the disease burden 
in 1865, and elevating to a syndemic status. Multivariate Poisson regression 
revealed patio level limiting factors (such as, presence of a cistern, a well, a 
live-in servant, and a Jewish co-resident), as well as risk factors (such as, a 
smallpox death in the building; the presence of a foreign-born individual). From 
the two-phase assessment of the syndemic in Gibraltar, we developed a conceptual 
framework for identifying, contributing, driving, and limiting factors.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetes affects more than 425 million people worldwide with a 
lifetime risk of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) of up to 25%. Management includes 
wound debridement, wound dressings, offloading, treatment of infection and 
ischaemia, optimising glycaemic control; use of advanced adjuvant therapies is 
limited by high cost and lack of robust evidence.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, seamless phase II/III, open, parallel 
group, multi-arm multi-stage randomised controlled trial in patients with a 
hard-to-heal DFU, with blinded outcome assessment. A maximum of 447 participants 
will be randomised (245 participants in phase II and 202 participants in phase 
III). The phase II primary objective will determine the efficacy of treatment 
strategies including hydrosurgical debridement ± decellularised dermal 
allograft, or the combination with negative pressure wound therapy, as an 
adjunct to treatment as usual (TAU), compared with TAU alone, with patients 
randomised in a 1:1:1:2 allocation. The outcome is achieving at least 50% 
reduction in index ulcer area at 4 weeks post randomisation.The phase III 
primary objective will determine whether one treatment strategy, continued from 
phase II, reduces time to healing of the index ulcer compared with TAU alone, 
with participants randomised in a 1:1 allocation. Secondary objectives will 
compare healing status of the index ulcer, infection rate, reulceration, quality 
of life, cost-effectiveness and incidence of adverse events over 52 weeks post 
randomisation. Phase II and phase III primary endpoint analysis will be 
conducted using a mixed-effects logistic regression model and Cox proportional 
hazards regression, respectively. A within-trial economic evaluation will be 
undertaken; the primary economic analysis will be a cost-utility analysis 
presenting ICERs for each treatment strategy in rank order of effectiveness, 
with effects expressed as quality-adjusted life years.The trial has predefined 
progression criteria for the selection of one treatment strategy into phase III 
based on efficacy, safety and costs at 4 weeks.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by the National 
Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee Yorkshire and The Humber - Bradford 
Leeds Research Ethics Committee; approved 26 April 2017; (REC reference: 
17/YH/0055). There is planned publication of a monograph in National Institute 
for Health Research journals and main trial results and associated papers in 
high-impact peer-reviewed journals.

Pulmonary endarterectomy is the guideline recommended treatment for chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, in addition to life-long anticoagulation 
therapy. The aim was to analyze long-term relative survival after pulmonary 
endarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. We included 
all patients who underwent pulmonary endarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension at Karolinska University Hospital between 1997 and 2018 
(n = 100). We obtained baseline characteristics and vital status from patient 
charts and national health-data registers. The expected survival from the 
general Swedish population matched by age, sex, and year of surgery was obtained 
from the Human Mortality Database. The relative survival was used as an estimate 
of cause-specific mortality. The mean age of the patients was 62 years and 39% 
were women. Most patients were severely symptomatic (95% in New York Heart 
Association functional class III-IV), and mean preoperative systolic/diastolic 
(mean) pulmonary artery pressure was 78/27 (45) mmHg. The mean and maximum 
follow-up time was 7.2 and 22.1 years, respectively. Early (30-day) mortality 
was 7%. The 15-year observed, expected, and relative survival was 55% (95% 
confidence interval, 40%-68%), 71%, and 77% (95% confidence interval, 56%-95%), 
respectively. The 15-year relative survival conditional on 30-day survival was 
83% (95% confidence interval, 60%-100%). Although the life expectancy following 
pulmonary endarterectomy was shorter compared to the general population, the 
difference was small in those who survived the operation and the early 
postoperative period. Patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary 
hypertension who are surgical candidates should undergo pulmonary endarterectomy 
to improve prognosis.

It is a common ground that humans have always modified the genome of both plants 
and animals. This intrusive process that has existed for thousands of years, 
many times through mistakes and failures, was initially carried out through the 
crossing of organisms with desirable features. This was done with the aim of 
creating and producing new plants and animals that would benefit humans, that is 
, they would offer better quality food, more opportunities for people to move 
and transport products, greater returns to work, resistance to diseases, etc. 
However, creating genetically modified organisms does not proceed without 
conflicts. One part of the equation concerns objections made by disputants of 
genetically modified organisms to the manipulation of life, as opposed to 
defenders who argue that it is essentially an extension of traditional plant 
cultivation and animal breeding techniques. There are also conflicts regarding 
the risks to the environment and human health from using genetically modified 
organisms. Concerns about the risks to the environment and human health from 
genetically modified products have been the subject of much debate, which has 
led to the development of regulatory frameworks for the evaluation of 
genetically modified crops. However, the absence of a globally accepted 
framework has the effect of slowing down technological development with negative 
consequences for areas of the world that could benefit from new technologies. 
So, while genetically modified crops can provide maximum benefits in food safety 
and in adapting crops to existing climate change, the absence of reforms, as 
well as the lack of harmonization of the frameworks and regulations about the 
genetic modifications results in all those expected benefits of using 
genetically modified crops being suspended. However, it is obvious that the 
evolution of genetically modified products is not going to stop. For that 
reason, research on the impact of genetic modification on medical technologies, 
agricultural production, commodity prices, land use and on the environment in 
general, should therefore continue.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic disease accounts for 70% of deaths globally and causes 
substantial economic burdens. Research indicates diet can significantly reduce 
the risk of many chronic diseases. Governments regulate health claims that can 
inform consumers of foods' health attributes and encourage them to consume 
healthy diets. This paper evaluates how the health status of North Americans has 
changed over time and after the approval of health claims in Canada and the 
United States.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the OECD Health Statistics database. A 
logarithmic health status function with country fixed-effects for Canada and the 
USA is used to evaluate changes in life expectancies over time.
RESULTS: The findings indicate the health claims significantly affected female 
but not male life expectancies. However, both female (0.303%/year) and male 
(0.611%/year) life expectancies improved over the period, suggesting they are 
responsive to external health information.
CONCLUSION: This paper provides insights and discusses policy options regarding 
the efficacy of specific health claims in Canada and the USA at nudging 
consumers to improve health outcomes.

OBJECTIFS: Les maladies chroniques représentent 70 % des décès dans le monde, 
ainsi qu’un fardeau économique important. Selon les études, le régime 
alimentaire peut considérablement réduire le risque de nombreuses maladies 
chroniques. Les gouvernements réglementent les allégations santé qui informent 
les consommateurs des attributs de santé de leurs aliments et les encouragent à 
adopter un régime sain. Nous avons cherché à déterminer si l’état de santé des 
Nord-Américains a changé au fil du temps et après l’approbation des allégations 
santé au Canada et aux États-Unis.
MÉTHODE: Nos données proviennent de la base de données de statistiques sur la 
santé de l’OCDE. Une fonction logarithmique de l’état de santé, à effets fixes 
par pays pour le Canada et les États-Unis, a permis d’évaluer les changements 
dans l’espérance de vie au fil du temps.
RÉSULTATS: Selon nos constatations, les allégations santé ont eu des effets 
significatifs sur l’espérance de vie des femmes, mais pas sur celle des hommes. 
Cependant, tant l’espérance de vie des femmes (0,303 %/année) que celle des 
hommes (0,611 %/année) se sont améliorées au cours de la période, ce qui donne à 
penser qu’elles sont sensibles aux informations sur la santé venant de 
l’extérieur.
CONCLUSION: Notre article apporte des éclaircissements et analyse des options 
stratégiques concernant l’efficacité potentielle de certaines allégations santé 
au Canada et aux États-Unis lorsqu’il s’agit d’encourager les consommateurs à 
améliorer leurs résultats de santé.

OBJECTIVE: This paper reports on the valuation of quality-of-life states in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Five Dimensions (AD-5D) instrument in a representative 
sample of the general population in Australia using the discrete-choice 
experiment with duration (DCETTO) elicitation technique.
METHOD: A DCE with 200 choice sets of two quality-of-life (QoL) state-duration 
combinations blocked into 20 survey versions, with ten choice sets in each 
version, was designed and administered online to a sample representative of the 
Australian population. Two additional choice sets comprising internal 
consistency and dominance checks were included in each survey version. A range 
of model specifications investigating preferences with respect to duration and 
interactions between AD-5D dimension levels were estimated. Utility weights were 
developed, with estimated coefficients transformed to the 0 (being dead) to 1 
(full health) scale, suitable for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) weights for use in economic evaluation.
RESULTS: In total, 1999 respondents completed the choice experiment. Overall, 
respondents were slightly better educated and had higher annual incomes than the 
Australian general population. The estimation results from different 
specifications and models were broadly consistent with the monotonic nature of 
the AD-5D: utility increased with increased life expectancy and decreased as the 
severity level for each dimension worsened. A utility value set was generated 
for the calculation of utilities for all QoL states defined by the AD-5D 
descriptive system.
CONCLUSION: The DCE-based utility value set is now available to use to generate 
QALYs for the economic evaluation of treatments and interventions targeting 
people with dementia and/or their family caregivers.

The oligodendrocyte lineage cell is crucial to proper brain function. During 
central nervous system development, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) 
migrate and proliferate to populate the entire brain and spinal cord, and 
subsequently differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes that wrap neuronal axons 
in an insulating myelin layer. When damage occurs to the myelin sheath, OPCs are 
activated and recruited to the demyelinated site, where they differentiate into 
oligodendrocytes that remyelinate the denuded axons. The process of OPC 
attraction and differentiation is influenced by a multitude of factors from the 
cell's niche. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are powerful and versatile 
enzymes that do not only degrade extracellular matrix proteins, but also cleave 
cell surface receptors, growth factors, signaling molecules, proteases and other 
precursor proteins, leading to their activation or degradation. MMPs are 
markedly upregulated during brain development and upon demyelinating injury, 
where their broad functions influence the behavior of neural progenitor cells 
(NPCs), OPCs and oligodendrocytes. In this review, we focus on the role of MMPs 
in (re)myelination. We will start out in the developing brain with describing 
the effects of MMPs on NPCs, OPCs and eventually oligodendrocytes. Then, we will 
outline their functions in oligodendrocyte process extension and developmental 
myelination. Finally, we will review their potential role in demyelination, 
describe their significance in remyelination and discuss the evidence for a role 
of MMPs in remyelination failure, focusing on multiple sclerosis. In conclusion, 
MMPs shape the oligodendrocyte (niche) both during development and upon 
demyelination, and thus are important players in directing the fate and behavior 
of oligodendrocyte lineage cells throughout their life cycle.

With rising life expectancy, the importance of patient-related prognostic 
factors and how to integrate such data into clinical decision-making becomes 
increasingly important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic 
impact of smoking status in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treated 
with intensive chemotherapy. We conducted a nationwide cohort study based on 
data obtained from the Danish National Leukaemia Registry (DNLR). The study 
comprised Danish patients aged 18-75 years, diagnosed with AML between 1 January 
2000 and 31 December 2012. Medical records were reviewed and data on smoking 
status were collected. A total of 1040 patients (median age 59 years) were 
included, and 602 patients (58·9%) were categorised as ever-smokers and the 
remaining as never-smokers. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates revealed that 
ever-smokers had a significant shorter median overall survival (OS) at 
17·2 months [95% CI (14·9;19·1)] compared to never-smokers at 24·5 months (95% 
CI [19·2;30·7]). Multivariate analysis revealed smoking status as a significant 
prognostic factor for inferior OS with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·22 [95% CI 
(1·04;1·44)]. In conclusion, smoking status was found to be associated with 
inferior OS in intensively treated AML patients.

Chronic diseases constitute a tremendous public health burden globally. Poor 
nutrition, inactive lifestyles, and obesity are established independent risk 
factors for chronic diseases. Public health decision-makers are in desperate 
need of effective and cost-effective programs that prevent chronic diseases. To 
date, most economic evaluations consider the effect of these programs on body 
weight, without considering their effects on other risk factors (nutrition and 
physical activity). We propose an economic evaluation approach that considers 
program effects on multiple risk factors rather than on a single risk factor. 
For demonstration, we developed an enhanced model that incorporates health 
promotion program effects on four risk factors (weight status, physical 
activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption). Relative to this enhanced model, 
a model that considered only the effect on weight status produced incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimates for quality-adjusted life years that 
were 1% to 43% higher, and ICER estimates for years with chronic disease 
prevented that were 1% to 26% higher. The corresponding estimates for return on 
investment were 1% to 20% lower. To avoid an underestimation of the economic 
benefits of chronic disease prevention programs, we recommend economic 
evaluations consider program effects on multiple risk factors.

Proline metabolism influences the metabolic and/or signaling pathway in 
regulating plant stress responses. This study aimed to characterize the 
physiological significance of glutamate (Glu)-mediated proline metabolism in the 
drought stress responses, focusing on the hormonal regulatory pathway. The 
responses of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling, proline metabolism, and redox components 
to the exogenous application of Glu in well-watered or drought-stressed plants 
were interpreted in relation to endogenous hormone status and their signaling 
genes. Drought-enhanced level of abscisic acid (ABA) was concomitant with the 
accumulation of ROS and proline, as well as loss of reducing potential, which 
was assessed by measuring NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ and GSH/GSSG ratios. Glu application 
to drought-stressed plants increased both salicylic acid (SA) and cytosolic Ca2+ 
levels, with the highest expression of calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK5) 
and salicylic acid synthesis-related ICS1. The SA-enhanced CPK5 expression was 
closely associated with further enhancement of proline synthesis-related genes 
(P5CS1, P5CS2, and P5CR) expression and a reset of reducing potential with 
enhanced expression of redox regulating genes (TRXh5 and GRXC9) in a SA-mediated 
NPR1- and/or PR1-dependent manner. These results clearly indicate that 
Glu-activated interplay between SA- and CPK5-signaling as well as Glu-enhanced 
proline synthesis are crucial in the amelioration of drought stress in Brassica 
napus.

The number of therapeutic peptides for human treatment is growing rapidly. 
However, their development faces two major issues: the poor yield of large 
peptides from conventional solid-phase synthesis, and the intrinsically short 
serum half-life of peptides. To address these issues, we investigated a platform 
for the production of a recombinant therapeutic peptide with an extended serum 
half-life involving the site-specific conjugation of human serum albumin (HSA). 
HSA has an exceptionally long serum half-life and can be used to extend the 
serum half-lives of therapeutic proteins and peptides. We used 
glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) as a model peptide in the present study. A 
"clickable" non-natural amino acid-p-azido-l-phenylalanine (AzF)-was 
incorporated into three specific sites (V16, Y19, and F28) of a GLP-1 variant, 
followed by conjugation with HSA through strain-promoted azide-alkyne 
cycloaddition. All three HSA-conjugated GLP-1 variants (GLP1_16HSA, GLP1_19HSA, 
and GLP1_28HSA) exhibited comparable serum half-lives in vivo. However, the 
three GLP1_HSA variants had different in vitro biological activities and in vivo 
glucose-lowering effects, demonstrating the importance of site-specific HSA 
conjugation. The platform described herein could be used to develop other 
therapeutic peptides with extended serum half-lives.

Shallow landslides damage buildings and other infrastructure, disrupt 
agriculture practices, and can cause social upheaval and loss of life. As a 
result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on 
producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to 
reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the 
power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithms-Logistic 
Model Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, 
and Support Vector Machine-in creating a reliable shallow landslide 
susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty 
conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the 
One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation 
processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based 
indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), 
root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic 
characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning 
models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the 
Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and 
prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), Naïve 
Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 
0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model 
in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision 
makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard 
and risk.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, severe, and rapidly progressive 
neurodegenerative disorder categorized as an atypical parkinsonian syndrome. 
With a mean life expectancy of 6-9 years after diagnosis, MSA is clinically 
characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, autonomic failure, and poor 
l-Dopa responsiveness. Aside from limited symptomatic treatment, there is 
currently no disease-modifying therapy available. Consequently, distinct 
pharmacological targets have been explored and investigated in clinical studies 
based on MSA-related symptoms and pathomechanisms. Parkinsonism, cerebellar 
ataxia, and autonomic failure are the most important symptoms targeted by 
symptomatic treatments in current clinical trials. The most prominent 
pathological hallmark is oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions containing 
alpha-synuclein, thus classifying MSA as synucleinopathy. Additionally, myelin 
and neuronal loss accompanied by micro- and astrogliosis are further distinctive 
features of MSA-related neuropathology present in numerous brain regions. 
Besides summarizing current symptomatic treatment strategies in MSA, this review 
critically reflects upon potential cellular targets and disease-modifying 
approaches for MSA such as (I) targeting α-syn pathology, (II) intervening 
neuroinflammation, and (III) neuronal loss. Although these single compound 
trials are aiming to interfere with distinct pathogenetic steps in MSA, a 
combined approach may be necessary to slow down the rapid progression of the 
oligodendroglial associated synucleinopathy.

With the increase in average life expectancy, several individuals are affected 
by age-associated non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs). The presence of 
NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), leads to the reduction in 
skeletal muscle mass, a pathological condition defined as sarcopenia. A key 
factor linking sarcopenia with cellular senescence and diabetes mellitus (DM) is 
oxidative stress. We previously reported as the absence of Peroxiredoxin 6 
(Prdx6), an antioxidant enzyme implicated in maintaining intracellular redox 
homeostasis, induces an early-stage of T2DM. In the present study we sought to 
understand the role of Prdx6 in the crosstalk between aging and diabetic 
sarcopenia, by using Prdx6 knockout (Prdx6-/-) mice. Absence of Prdx6 reduced 
telomeres length and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) nuclear localization. An increase in 
Sa-β-Gal activity and p53-p21 pro-aging pathway were also evident. An impairment 
in IGF-1 (Insulin-like Groth Factor-1)/Akt-1/mTOR pathway leading to a relative 
increase in Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) nuclear localization and in a decrease of 
muscle differentiation as per lower levels of myoblast determination protein 1 
(MyoD) was observed. Muscle atrophy was also present in Prdx6-/- mice by the 
increase in Muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) levels and proteins ubiquitination 
associated to a reduction in muscle strength. The present study, innovatively, 
highlights a fundamental role of Prdx6, in the crosstalk between aging, 
sarcopenia, and DM.

The last years have brought into attention more than ever concerns regarding the 
accelerating degradation of the environmental conditions which threaten both the 
present but mainly the future of human society. Under such circumstances, the 
society and especially the governments need to acknowledge the seriousness of 
environment issues and be able to develop and put into practice specific 
policies to counteract them. In this regard, this paper performs an analysis on 
a group of 11 European developing countries, over the period between 2000 and 
2017, aiming first to evaluate the impact of the changing environment conditions
