to changes in juvenile survival, and least sensitive to changes in fecundity. A 
population decline could be expected with only a 6% decrease in adult survival, 
whereas a 32% decrease in fecundity would be necessary to bring about a 
population decline. These results have important implications for population 
management and suggest current research priorities should be shifted to a 
greater emphasis on survival rates and causes of mortality.

Heart Failure.

Gedela M, Khan M, Jonsson O.

Heart failure is a major public health concern. It is the most common reason for 
hospitalization. It commonly affects older population and given the increasing 
life expectancy coupled with improved management of chronic medical conditions, 
the number of patients with heart failure is expected to increase. Heart failure 
has been recently categorized into heart failure with reduced and preserved 
ejection fraction. Despite differences in the two types, mortality remains high 
and similar in both conditions. Over the past few decades, numerous medical and 
device based therapies have been developed for the management of heart failure. 
These therapies have improved outcomes for the patients both in terms of 
morbidity and mortality. The objective of this review is to provide an overview 
of management of heart failure, specifically heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction. It is of paramount importance for all health care providers to be 
aware of therapies for management of heart failure. We will also briefly discuss 
the role of mechanical circulatory support as an emerging new therapy for 
patients with advanced heart failure.

Memory decline is one of the greatest health threats of the twenty-first 
century. Because of the widespread increase in life expectancy, 20 percent of 
the global population will be over 60 in 2050 and the problems caused by 
age-related memory loss will be dramatically aggravated. However, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying this inevitable process are not well understood. Here we 
show that the activity of the recently discovered mechanistic target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) declines with age in the brain of both fruit 
flies and rodents and that the loss of mTORC2-mediated actin polymerization 
contributes to age-associated memory loss. Intriguingly, treatment with a small 
molecule that activates mTORC2 (A-443654) reverses long-term memory (LTM) 
deficits in both aged mice and flies. In addition, we found that 
pharmacologically boosting either mTORC2 or actin polymerization enhances LTM. 
In contrast to the current approaches to enhance memory that have primarily 
targeted the regulation of gene expression (epigenetic, transcriptional, and 
translational), our data points to a novel, evolutionarily conserved mechanism 
for restoring memory that is dependent on structural plasticity. These insights 
into the molecular basis of age-related memory loss may hold promise for new 
treatments for cognitive disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Although available evidence is modest, exercise could be beneficial 
in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. We aim to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a dyadic exercise regimen for individuals 
with dementia and their main carer as therapy for behavioural and psychological 
symptoms of dementia.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis within a two-arm, pragmatic, randomised, 
controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial of a dyadic exercise regimen 
(individually tailored, for 20-30 min at least five times per week). The study 
randomised 131 community-dwelling individuals with dementia and clinically 
significant behavioural and psychological symptoms with a carer willing and able 
to participate in the exercise regimen; 52 dyads provided sufficient cost data 
for analyses.
RESULTS: Mean intervention cost was £284 per dyad. For the subsample of 52 
dyads, the intervention group had significantly higher mean cost from a societal 
perspective (mean difference £2728.60, p = 0.05), but costs were not 
significantly different from a health and social care perspective. The exercise 
intervention was more cost-effective than treatment as usual from both societal 
and health and social care perspectives for the measure of behavioural and 
psychological symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). It does not appear 
cost-effective in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year gain.
CONCLUSIONS: The exercise intervention has the potential to be seen as 
cost-effective when considering behavioural and psychological symptoms but did 
not appear cost-effective when considering quality-adjusted life year gains.

AIM: To provide an overview of thresholds for incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) representing willingness-to-pay (WTP) across multiple countries 
and insights into exemptions pertaining to the ICER (e.g., cancer). To compare 
ICER thresholds to individual country's estimated ability-to-pay.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We included AHRQ/USA, BIQG-GOEG/Austria, CADTH/Canada, 
DAHTA@DIMDI/Germany, DECIT-CGATS/Brazil, HAS/France, HITAP/Thailand, 
IQWiG/Germany, LBI-HTA/Austria, MSAC/Australia, NICE/England/Wales and 
SBU/Sweden. ICER thresholds were derived from systematic literature/website 
search/expert surveys. WTP was compared with ATP using Spearman's rank 
correlation.
RESULTS: Two general and explicitly acknowledged thresholds (England/Wales, 
Thailand), implicit thresholds in six countries and different ICER 
thresholds/decision-making rules in oncology were identified. Correlation 
between WTP and ability-to-pay was moderate.
DISCUSSION: Our overview supports country-specific discussions on WTP and on how 
to define value(s) within societies.

Neurons typically assume multipolar, bipolar, or unipolar morphologies. Little 
is known about the mechanisms underlying the development of these basic 
morphological types. Here, we show that the Krüppel-like transcription factor 
Dar1 determines the multipolar morphology of postmitotic neurons in Drosophila. 
Dar1 is specifically expressed in multipolar neurons and loss of dar1 gradually 
converts multipolar neurons into the bipolar or unipolar morphology without 
changing neuronal identity. Conversely, misexpression of Dar1 or its mammalian 
homolog in unipolar and bipolar neurons causes them to assume multipolar 
morphologies. Dar1 regulates the expression of several dynein genes and nuclear 
distribution protein C (nudC), which is an essential component of a specialized 
dynein complex that positions the nucleus in a cell. We further show that these 
genes are required for Dar1-induced multipolar neuron morphology. Dar1 likely 
functions as a terminal selector gene for the basic layout of neuron morphology 
by regulating both dendrite extension and the dendrite-nucleus coupling.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The three basic morphological types of 
neurons--unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar--are important for information 
processing and wiring of neural circuits. Little progress has been made toward 
understanding the molecular and cellular programs that generate these types 
since their discovery over a century ago. It is generally assumed that basic 
morphological types of neurons are determined by the number of dendrites growing 
out from the cell body. Here, we show that this model alone is insufficient. We 
introduce the positioning of nucleus as a critical factor in this process and 
report that the transcription factor Dar1 determines multipolar neuron 
morphology in postmitotic neurons by regulating genes involved in nuclear 
positioning.

This paper aims to report the assessment of trends in deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributed to ambient particulate matter 
(PM) pollution from 1990 to 2010 by sex and age in Iran. We used the data of the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 Study, and then we extracted its data on 
Iran for the years 1990, 2005, and 2010. The proportion of deaths and the DALYs 
caused by specific risk factors were assessed by using the comparative risk 
assessment and calculating the attributed burden of exposure level to each risk 
factor compared with the theoretical minimum level of risk exposure. 
Uncertainties in distribution of exposure, relative risks, and relevant outcomes 
calculation were disseminated into the estimates of the attributable deaths and 
DALYs. We found that the age-standardized death rate attributed to ambient PM 
pollution decreased to 27.90 cases per 100,000 populations from 1990 to 2010 
[86, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 76-97 to 62; 95% UI 54-71 per 100,000 
populations, respectively]. This was mainly because of greater decrease in 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) than in the other diseases attributed to PM 
pollution. Despite a decrease in the total DALYs and mortality rate attributed 
to PM pollution, the death percent increased by 6.94%, 95% UI 6.06-7.90% from 
1990 to 2010. The number of the DALYs and death in age groups of more than 70 
years increased in 2010 compared to that in 1990. The median percent change of 
the DALYs and death for all age groups shows that the DALYs and death increased 
by 6% (95% UI 8-19%) and 45% (95% UI 30-60%), respectively, in 2010 in 
comparison to that in 1990. The increase in the DALYs and mortality attributable 
to PM pollution emphasizes the necessity of the effective interventions for 
improving air quality, as well as for increasing the public awareness to reduce 
the exposure of vulnerable age groups to PM pollution.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to understand the functional health of 
older adults in China and to assess the potential for advancing healthy and 
active aging.
METHOD: Data of 13,739 older adults aged 50 years and older from the China 
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2011 were analyzed. Life expectancy 
in good perceived health, chronic-disease-free life expectancy, active life 
expectancy, and severe impairment-free life expectancy were calculated using 
Sullivan's method.
RESULTS: At age 50 years, older adults had a life expectancy in good perceived 
health of 7.0 and 6.7 years in men and women, respectively. They would remain 
chronic-disease-free for 8.4 and 8.6 years, without activity limitation for 23.6 
and 26.0 years, and severe impairment-free for 21.4 and 24.2 years.
DISCUSSION: The world's largest aging population was spending a substantial 
proportion of remaining life years in suboptimal health and well-being, while 
remaining largely independent in basic self-care without severe impairments.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV-1 infection into a 
managed condition with near-normal life expectancy. However, a significant 
number of patients remain with limited therapeutic options due to HIV-1 
resistance, side effects, or drug costs. Further, it is likely that current 
drugs will not retain efficacy, due to risks of side effects and transmitted 
resistance.
RESULTS: We describe compound 5660386 
(3-ethyl-2-[3-(1,3,3-trimethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1-propen-1-yl]-1,3-benzothiazol-3-ium) 
as a novel inhibitor of HIV-1 entry. Compound 5660386 inhibits HIV-1 entry in 
cell lines and primary cells, binds to HIV-1 envelope protein, and inhibits the 
interaction of GP120 to CD4. Further, compound 5660386 showed a unique and 
broad-range activity against primary HIV-1 isolates from different subtypes and 
geographical areas.
CONCLUSION: Development of small-molecule entry inhibitors of HIV-1 such as 
5660386 may lead to novel classes of anti-HIV-1 therapeutics. These inhibitors 
may be particularly effective against viruses resistant to current 
antiretroviral drugs and could have potential applications in both treatment and 
prevention.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are important problems among patients 
with schizophrenia. A wide spectrum of reasons, ranging from genes to the 
environment, are held responsible for causing the cardiovascular risk factors 
that may lead to shortening the life expectancy of patients with schizophrenia. 
Here, we have summarized the etiologic issues related with the cardiovascular 
risk factors in schizophrenia. First, we focused on heritable factors associated 
with cardiovascular disease and schizophrenia by mentioning studies about 
genetics-epigenetics, in the first-episode or drug-naïve patients. In this 
context, the association and candidate gene studies about metabolic disturbances 
in schizophrenia are reviewed, and the lack of the effects of 
epigenetic/posttranscriptional factors such as microRNAs is mentioned. Increased 
rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus and disrupted metabolic parameters in 
schizophrenia are forcing clinicians to struggle with metabolic syndrome 
parameters and related issues, which are also the underlying causes for the risk 
of having cardiometabolic and cardiovascular etiology. Second, we summarized the 
findings of metabolic syndrome-related entities and discussed the influence of 
the illness itself, antipsychotic drug treatment, and the possible 
disadvantageous lifestyle on the occurrence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) or 
diabetes mellitus. Third, we emphasized on the risk factors of sudden cardiac 
death in patients with schizophrenia. We reviewed the findings on the 
arrhythmias such as QT prolongation, which is a risk factor for Torsade de 
Pointes and sudden cardiac death or P-wave prolongation that is a risk factor 
for atrial fibrillation. For example, the use of antipsychotics is an important 
reason for the prolongation of QT and some other cardiac autonomic dysfunctions. 
Additionally, we discussed relatively rare issues such as myocarditis and 
cardiomyopathy, which are important for prognosis in schizophrenia that may have 
originated from the use of antipsychotic medication. In conclusion, we 
considered that the studies and awareness about physical needs of patients with 
schizophrenia are increasing. It seems logical to increase cooperation and 
shared care between the different health care professionals to screen and treat 
cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk factors, MetS, and diabetes in patients with 
psychiatric disorders, because some risk factors of MetS or CVD are avoidable or 
at least modifiable to decrease high mortality in schizophrenia. We suggested 
that future research should focus on conducting an integrated system of studies 
based on a holistic biopsychosocial evaluation.

The method of lifespan extension that is a practical application of the 
informational theory of aging is proposed. In this theory, the degradation 
(error accumulation) of the genetic information in cells is considered a main 
cause of aging. According to it, our method is based on the transplantation of 
genetically identical (or similar) stem cells with the lower number of genomic 
errors to the old recipients. For humans and large mammals, this method can be 
realized by cryopreservation of their own stem cells, taken in a young age, for 
the later autologous transplantation in old age. To test this method 
experimentally, we chose laboratory animals of relatively short lifespan 
(mouse). Because it is difficult to isolate the required amount of the stem 
cells (e.g., bone marrow) without significant damage for animals, we used the 
bone marrow transplantation from sacrificed inbred young donors. It is shown 
that the lifespan extension of recipients depends on level of their genetic 
similarity (syngeneity) with donors. We have achieved the lifespan increase of 
the experimental mice by 34% when the transplantation of the bone marrow with 
high level of genetic similarity was used.

Betanodaviruses cause massive mortality in marine fish species with viral 
nervous necrosis. The structure of a T = 3 Grouper nervous necrosis virus-like 
particle (GNNV-LP) is determined by the ab initio method with 
non-crystallographic symmetry averaging at 3.6 Å resolution. Each capsid protein 
(CP) shows three major domains: (i) the N-terminal arm, an inter-subunit 
extension at the inner surface; (ii) the shell domain (S-domain), a jelly-roll 
structure; and (iii) the protrusion domain (P-domain) formed by three-fold 
trimeric protrusions. In addition, we have determined structures of the T = 1 
subviral particles (SVPs) of (i) the delta-P-domain mutant (residues 35-217) at 
3.1 Å resolution; and (ii) the N-ARM deletion mutant (residues 35-338) at 7 Å 
resolution; and (iii) the structure of the individual P-domain (residues 
214-338) at 1.2 Å resolution. The P-domain reveals a novel DxD motif 
asymmetrically coordinating two Ca2+ ions, and seems to play a prominent role in 
the calcium-mediated trimerization of the GNNV CPs during the initial capsid 
assembly process. The flexible N-ARM (N-terminal arginine-rich motif) appears to 
serve as a molecular switch for T = 1 or T = 3 assembly. Finally, we find that 
polyethylene glycol, which is incorporated into the P-domain during the 
crystallization process, enhances GNNV infection. The present structural studies 
together with the biological assays enhance our understanding of the role of the 
P-domain of GNNV in the capsid assembly and viral infection by this 
betanodavirus.

Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a chronic blood cancer; its clinical features are 
dominated by myeloproliferation (erythrocytosis, often leucocytosis and/or 
thrombocytosis) and a tendency for thrombosis and transformation to 
myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukaemia. In the past 10 years the 
pathophysiology of this condition has been defined as JAK/STAT pathway 
activation, almost always due to mutations in JAK2 exons 12 or 14 (JAK2 V617F). 
In the same time period our understanding of the optimal management of PV has 
expanded, most recently culminating in the approval of JAK inhibitors for the 
treatment of PV patients who are resistant or intolerant to therapy with 
hydroxycarbamide. It has also been demonstrated that life expectancy for many 
patients with PV is not normal, nor is their quality of life. We critically 
explore these findings and discuss their impact. In addition, we highlight 
persisting gaps in our current management strategy; for example, what is the 
optimal first line cytoreductive therapy and, indeed, which patients need 
cytoreductive drugs.

Along with greater life expectancy in patients with haemophilia has been an 
increase in associated haemophilia-related (arthropathy, osteoporosis, viral 
infections) and age-related (cardiovascular disease, renal disease, cancer and 
others) comorbidities, many of which are only just emerging as the population 
ages. At present, experience in managing these comorbidities is limited. As the 
demographic shift continues, haemophilia care centres can expect to encounter 
more patients with greater levels of complexity. In the absence of 
evidence-based information to guide the management of adult patients with 
haemophilia, it is important that the scientific position be reviewed on a 
regular basis. To this end, several topics relevant to the clinical management 
of adult patients with haemophilia were examined in a symposium entitled 
Comorbidities and inhibitors in adult patients with haemophilia: issues, costs 
and management strategies held on 11 February 2015 in Helsinki, Finland, in 
conjunction with the 8th Annual Congress of the European Association for 
Haemophilia and Allied Disorders. This article is a summary of that event.

Significant improvements in therapy and life expectancy of β-thalassemia 
patients in last decades result in the need of commitment for gynecologists and 
obstetricians as the complexity of organ impairment needs a specific 
multidisciplinary approach. After a review of clinical manifestations of 
β-thalassemia from a gynecologic point of view, we present the experience of a 
gynecologic center in treating β-thalassemia patients from more than 20 years.

INTRODUCTION: With an increase in life expectancy in 'developed' countries, the 
number of elderly patients receiving joint injections for arthritis is 
increasing. There are legitimate concerns about an increased risk of 
thromboembolism if anticoagulation is stopped or reversed for such an injection. 
Despite being a common dilemma, the literature on this issue is scarce.
METHODS: We undertook 2,084 joint injections of the knee and shoulder in 1,714 
patients between August 2008 and December 2013. Within this cohort, we noted 41 
patients who were taking warfarin and followed them immediately after joint 
injection in the clinic or radiology department, looking carefully for 
complications. Then, we sought clinical follow-up, correspondence, and imaging 
evidence for 4 weeks, looking for complications from these joint injections. We 
recorded International Normalised Ratio (INR) values before injection.
RESULTS: No complications were associated with the procedure after any joint 
injection. The radiologists who undertook ultrasound-guided injections to 
shoulders re-scanned the joints looking for haemarthroses: they found none. A 
similar outcome was noted clinically after injections in the outpatient setting.
CONCLUSION: With a mean INR of 2.77 (range, 1.7-5.5) and a maximum INR within 
this group of 5.5, joint injections to the shoulder and knee can be undertaken 
safely in primary or secondary care settings despite the patient taking 
warfarin.

With the increasing life expectancy, the geriatric population has been 
increasing over the past few decades. By the year 2050, it is projected to 
compose more than a fifth of the entire population, representing a 147% increase 
in this age group. There has been a steady increase in the number of medical and 
psychiatric disorders, and a large percentage of geriatric patients are now 
presenting to the emergency department with such disorders. The management of 
our progressively complex geriatric patient population will require an 
integrative team approach involving emergency medicine, psychiatry, and 
hospitalist medicine.

The current study reassesses the prevalence of fragility fractures and lifetime 
costs in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Forty-two percent (391) of the 
fractures were at the neck of the femur, and 38.6 % (354) were 
inter-trochanteric fractures. The overall incidence was assessed to be 7528 
(1,300,336 population 55 years or older) with the direct cost of SR564.75 
million ($150.60 million). A National Fracture Registry and osteoporosis 
awareness programs are recommended.
PURPOSE: Proximal femur fragility fractures are reported to be increasing 
worldwide due to increased life expectancy. The current study is carried out to 
assess the incidence of such fractures in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia 
and to assess the costs incurred in managing them annually. Finally, by 
extrapolating the data, the study can calculate the overall economic burden in 
Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: The data of fragility proximal femur fractures was collected from 24 of 
28 hospitals in the Eastern Province. The data included age, sex, mode of 
injury, type of fracture, prescribed drug (and its cost), and length of hospital 
stay. Population statistics were obtained from the Department of Statistics of 
the Saudi Arabian government Web site.
RESULTS: Twenty-four hospitals (85 %) participated in the study. A total of 780 
fractures were sustained by 681 patients. Length of stay in the hospital 
averaged 23.28 ± 13.08 days. The projected fracture rate from all the hospitals 
would be 917 (an incidence of 5.81/1000), with a total cost of SR68.77 million. 
Further extrapolation showed that the overall incidence could be 7528 (1,300,336 
population 55 years or older) with the direct cost of SR564.75 million ($150.60 
million).
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis-related femoral fractures in Saudi Arabia are 
significant causes of morbidity besides incurring economic burden. We believe 
that a National Fracture Registry needs to be established, and osteoporosis 
awareness programs should be instituted in every part of Saudi Arabia so that 
these patients can be diagnosed early and treated appropriately to reduce both 
the number of fractures and the economic burden of the fractures.

After surgery, patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) should be 
assessed regarding the presence of residual disease, the localization of 
metastases, and the identification of progressive disease. Postoperatively, 
patients with MTC are staged to separate those at low risk from those at high 
risk of recurrence. The TNM staging system is based on tumor size, 
extra-thyroidal invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant spread of cancer. In 
addition, the number of lymph-node metastases, the number of compartments 
involved, and the postoperative calcitonin (CTN) and carcinoembryonic antigen 
(CEA) levels should be documented. The postoperative normalization of the serum 
CTN level is associated with a favorable outcome. When patients have basal serum 
CTN levels less than 150 pg/ml after a thyroidectomy, any persistent or 
recurrent disease is nearly always confined to lymph nodes in the neck. When the 
postoperative serum CTN level exceeds 150 pg/ml, patients should be evaluated 
with imaging procedures, including computed tomography (CT) of the neck and 
chest, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) of 
the liver, bone scintigraphy, MRI of the bone, and positron emission tomography 
(PET)/CT. One can estimate the growth rate of MTC metastases by quantifying 
increases in tumor size over time from sequential imaging studies analyzed with 
response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), and by determining the 
tumor marker doubling time from sequential measures of serum CTN or CEA levels 
over multiple time points. One of the main challenges remains to find effective 
adjuvant and palliative options for patients with metastatic disease. Patients 
with persistent or recurrent MTC localized to the neck following thyroidectomy 
are candidates for neck operations, depending on the tumor extension. Once 
metastases appear, the clinician must decide which patients require therapy. 
This requires a balance between the (often) slow rate of tumor progression, 
which is associated with a good quality of life, and the limited efficacy and 
potential toxicities of local and systemic therapies. Considering that 
metastatic MTC is incurable, the management goals are to provide loco-regional 
disease control, palliate symptoms of hormonal excess, such as diarrhea, 
palliate symptomatic metastases, like pain or bone fracture, and control 
metastases that threaten life, such as bronchial obstruction or spinal cord 
compression. This can be achieved with palliative surgery, external beam 
radiation therapy (EBRT), or systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI).

It is estimated that the world population will reach a record 7.3 billion in 
2015, and the high burden of chronic conditions associated with ageing and 
smoking will increase further. Respiratory diseases in general receive little 
attention and funding in comparison with other major causes of global morbidity 
and mortality. In particular, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has 
been a major public health problem and will remain a challenge for clinicians 
within the 21st century. Worldwide, COPD is in the spotlight, since its high 
prevalence, morbidity and mortality create formidable challenges for health-care 
systems. This review emphasizes the magnitude of the COPD problem from a 
clinician's standpoint by drawing extensively from the new findings of the 
Global Burden of Disease study. Updated, distilled information on the population 
distribution of COPD is useful for the clinician to help provide an appreciation 
of the relative impact of COPD in daily practice compared with other chronic 
conditions, and to allocate minimum resources in anticipation of future needs in 
care. Despite recent trends in reduction of COPD standardized mortality rates 
and some recent successes in anti-smoking efforts in a number of Western 
countries, the overarching demographic impact of ageing in an ever-expanding 
world population, joined with other factors such as high rates of smoking and 
air pollution in Asia, will ensure that COPD will continue to pose an 
ever-increasing problem well into the 21st century.

Fecundity is defined as the number of progeny produced by an organism. In our 
study, we used three different experimental settings to measure the fecundity of 
rugose spiraling whitefly (Aleurodicus rugioperculatus Martin), a recent 
invasive insect in Florida, on Strelitzia nicolai host plants. The adult 
longevity was significantly different among treatments, with females surviving 
significantly longer in groups in whole-plant cages and individual females in 
clip cages compared with individual females in whole-plant cages. Females laid 
34.5 ± 8.4, 156.4 ± 18.3, and 225.2 ± 18 eggs, on average, when kept 
individually in whole-plant cages, in a group in whole-plant cages, and 
individually in clip cages, respectively. In all treatments, there was a 
significant correlation between the longevity and fecundity of females. Males 
emerged earlier than females in all treatments. Virgin females produced only 
males in the F1, while mated females produced both males and females, which 
suggests an arrhenotokous parthenogenesis. The egg-to-adult survival of the 
whitefly was 29 ± 4%, and the highest mortality occurred at the crawler stage 
when reared on S. nicolai. The results showed a significant effect of 
aggregation and cage setting on longevity and fecundity of this whitefly. To 
conclude, the experimental setting of the group fecundity treatment is more 
similar to what occurs in the landscape. Such a significant effect of cage 
setting and aggregation on the life-history parameters should be always taken 
into account when designing experiments or interpreting results.

Psychosis increases the risk of CVD, obesity and type 2 diabetes and reduces 
life expectancy. There are limited data comparing the dietary habits of 
community-dwelling first-episode psychosis sufferers - with autonomy over diet - 
and the general population. The data represent the retrospective evaluation of 
nutritional data collected between 2007 and 2013 from 143 individuals from the 
UK population receiving treatment for first-episode psychosis. Differences in 
mean nutrient intakes between the study cohort and the national sample were 
tested for statistical significance using independent t tests, incorporating 
Satterthwaite's correction where required. Mean total energy intake was lower 
for males (P = 0·049) and higher for females (P = 0·016) in the cohort than in 
the corresponding subgroups of the national sample. Females in the study cohort 
consumed 12·9 (95 % CI 4·3, 21·5) g more total fat per d, whilst males consumed 
7·7 (95 % CI 0·5, 14·9) g less protein per d than the national sample. Males in 
the study also showed significantly lower mean intakes than nationally of 
folate, Fe, Se, vitamin D and Zn, but not vitamin C. The proportion of 
individuals not meeting the lower reference nutrient intakes, particularly for
