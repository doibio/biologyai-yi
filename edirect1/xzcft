the health and economic impact of United Community Clinic (UCC), a student-run 
clinic in Philadelphia, PA. We found that with an annual operating budget of 
$50,000, UCC saves 6.5 QALYs, corresponding to over $850,000 saved.
CONCLUSIONS: Using Monte Carlo simulation methods, the health and economic 
impact of SRCs can be reasonably estimated to demonstrate the utility of SRCs 
and justify their growing importance in the healthcare delivery landscape of the 
US.

Process-based models are increasingly used to study agroecosystem interactions 
and N2 O emissions from agricultural fields. The widespread use of these models 
to conduct research and inform policy benefits from periodic model comparisons 
that assess the state of agroecosystem modeling and indicate areas for model 
improvement. This work provides an evaluation of simulated N2 O flux from three 
process-based models: DayCent, DNDC, and EPIC. The models were calibrated and 
validated using data collected from two research sites over five years that 
represent cropping systems and nitrogen fertilizer management strategies common 
to dairy cropping systems. We also evaluated the use of a multi-model ensemble 
strategy, which inconsistently outperformed individual model estimations. 
Regression analysis indicated a cross-model bias to underestimate high magnitude 
daily and cumulative N2 O flux. Model estimations of observed soil temperature 
and water content did not sufficiently explain model underestimations, and we 
found significant variation in model estimates of heterotrophic respiration, 
denitrification, soil NH4+ , and soil NO3- , which may indicate that additional 
types of observed data are required to evaluate model performance and possible 
biases. Our results suggest a bias in the model estimation of N2 O flux from 
agroecosystems that limits the extension of models beyond calibration and as 
instruments of policy development. This highlights a growing need for the 
modeling and measurement communities to collaborate in the collection and 
analysis of the data necessary to improve models and coordinate future 
development.

BACKGROUND: Juvenile hormones (JH) and ecdysteroids control postembryonic 
development in insects. They serve as valuable targets for pest management. 
Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of their action is of crucial 
importance. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a universal transcriptional 
co-regulator. It controls the expression of several genes including those from 
hormone signaling pathways through co-activation of many transcription factors. 
However, the role of CBP during postembryonic development in insects is not well 
understood. Therefore, we have studied the role of CBP in postembryonic 
development in Tribolium, a model coleopteran insect.
RESULTS: CBP is ubiquitously expressed in the red flour beetle, Tribolium 
castaneum. RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown of CBP resulted in a 
decrease in JH induction of Kr-h1 gene expression in Tribolium larvae and led to 
a block in their development. Moreover, the injection of CBP double-stranded RNA 
(dsRNA) showed lethal phenotypes within 8 days of injection. RNA-seq and 
subsequent differential gene expression analysis identified CBP target genes in 
Tribolium. Knockdown of CBP caused a decrease in the expression of 1306 genes 
coding for transcription factors and other proteins associated with growth and 
development. Depletion of CBP impaired the expression of several JH response 
genes (e.g., Kr-h1, Hairy, early trypsin) and ecdysone response genes (EcR, E74, 
E75, and broad complex). Further, GO enrichment analyses of the downregulated 
genes showed enrichment in different functions including developmental 
processes, pigmentation, anatomical structure development, regulation of 
biological and cellular processes, etc.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest diverse but crucial roles for CBP during 
postembryonic development in the coleopteran model insect, Tribolium. It can 
serve as a target for RNAi mediated pest management of this stored product pest.

BACKGROUND: People with psychosis have a reduced life expectancy of 10-20 years, 
largely due to cardiovascular disease. This trial aimed to determine the 
effectiveness of a modular health promotion intervention (IMPaCT Therapy) in 
improving health and reducing cardiovascular risk in psychosis.
METHODS: A multicentre, two arm, parallel cluster RCT was conducted across five 
UK mental health NHS trusts. Community care coordinators (CC) were randomly 
assigned to training and supervision in delivering IMPaCT Therapy or treatment 
as usual (TAU) to current patients with psychosis (cluster). The primary outcome 
was the physical and mental health subscales of the Short form-36 (SF-36) 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Of 104 care coordinators recruited, 52 (with 213 patients) were 
randomised to deliver IMPaCT therapy and 52 (with 193 patients) randomised to 
TAU. Of 406 patients, 318 (78%) and 301 (74%) attended 12- and 15-month 
follow-up respectively. IMPaCT therapy showed no significant effect on the 
physical or mental health component SF-36 scores versus TAU at 12 or 15 months. 
No effect was observed for cardiovascular risk indicators, except for HDL 
cholesterol, which improved more with IMPACT therapy than TAU (Treatment effect 
(95% CI); 0.085 (0.007 to 0.16); p = 0.034). The 22% of patients who received 
>180 min of IMPACT Therapy in addition to usual care achieved a greater 
reduction in waist circumference than did controls, which was clinically 
significant.
CONCLUSION: Training and supervising community care coordinators to use IMPaCT 
therapy in patients with psychosis is insufficient to significantly improve 
physical or mental health quality of life. The search for effective, pragmatic 
interventions deliverable in health care services continues.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was retrospectively registered with ISRCTN 
registry on 23/4/2010 at ISRCTN58667926 ; recruitment started on 01/03/2010 with 
first randomization on 09.08.2010 ISRCTN58667926 .

BACKGROUND: Experience sampling, a method for real-time self-monitoring of 
affective experiences, holds opportunities for person-tailored treatment. By 
focussing on dynamic patterns of positive affect, experience sampling method 
interventions (ESM-I) accommodate strategies to enhance personalized treatment 
of depression-at potentially low-costs. This study aimed to investigate the 
cost-effectiveness of an experience sampling method intervention in patients 
with depression, from a societal perspective.
METHODS: Participants were recruited between January 2010 and February 2012 from 
out-patient mental health care facilities in or near the Dutch cities of 
Eindhoven and Maastricht, and through local advertisements. Out-patients 
diagnosed with major depression (n = 101) receiving pharmacotherapy were 
randomized into: (i) ESM-I consisting of six weeks of ESM combined with weekly 
feedback regarding the individual's positive affective experiences, (ii) six 
weeks of ESM without feedback, or (iii) treatment as usual only. Alongside this 
randomised controlled trial, an economic evaluation was conducted consisting of 
a cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis, using Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale (HDRS) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome, with 
willingness-to-pay threshold for a QALY set at €50,000 (based on Dutch 
guidelines for moderate severe to severe illnesses).
RESULTS: The economic evaluation showed that ESM-I is an optimal strategy only 
when willingness to pay is around €3000 per unit HDRS and around €40,500 per 
QALY. ESM-I was the least favourable treatment when willingness to pay was lower 
than €30,000 per QALY. However, at the €50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, 
ESM-I was, with a 46% probability, the most favourable treatment (base-case 
analysis). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results.
CONCLUSIONS: We may tentatively conclude that ESM-I is a cost-effective add-on 
intervention to pharmacotherapy in outpatients with major depression.

    Glob Health Sci Pract. 2017 Dec 28;5(4):530-533.

OBJECTIVE: The association between increased risk of HIV acquisition and use of 
progestin-only injectables (POIs) is controversial. We sought to compare the 
competing risks of maternal mortality and HIV acquisition with use of POIs using 
updated data on this association and considering an expanded number of African 
countries.
METHODS: We designed a decision-analytic model to compare the benefits and risks 
of POIs on the competing risks of maternal mortality and HIV acquisition on life 
expectancy for women in 9 African countries. For the purposes of this analysis, 
we assumed that POIs were associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition 
(hazards ratio of 1.4). Our primary outcome was life-years and the population 
was women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in these countries, who did not have 
HIV infection and were not currently planning a pregnancy. Probabilities for 
each variable included in the model, such as HIV incidence, access to 
antiretroviral therapy, and contraceptive prevalence, were obtained from the 
literature. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed to 
check model assumptions and explore how uncertainty in estimates would affect 
the model results.
RESULTS: In all countries, discontinuation of POIs without replacement with an 
equally effective contraceptive method would result in decreased life expectancy 
due to a significant increase in maternal deaths. While the removal of POIs from 
the market would result in the prevention of some new cases of HIV, the 
life-years gained from this are mitigated due to the marked increase in neonatal 
HIV cases and maternal mortality with associated life-years lost. In all 
countries, except South Africa, typical-use contraceptive failure rates with 
POIs would need to exceed 39%, and more than half of women currently using POIs 
would have to switch to another effective method, for the removal of POIs to 
demonstrate an increase in total life-years.
CONCLUSION: Women living in sub-Saharan Africa cope with both high rates of HIV 
infection and high rates of pregnancy-related maternal death relative to the 
rest of the world. Based on the most current estimates, our model suggests that 
removal of POI contraception from the market without effective and acceptable 
contraception replacement would have a net negative effect on maternal health, 
life expectancy, and mortality under a variety of scenarios.

INTRODUCTION: Acceptance and commitment therapy tries to increase one's 
psychological acceptance regarding subjective experiences (thoughts, feelings, 
etc.,) and in turn, decrease ineffective control actions.
AIM: The current study was conducted with the aim to investigate the effect of 
acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on the amount of life expectancy and 
anxiety among bereaved patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This research was a quasi-experimental study with 
pretest-post-test control group design. The statistical population included all 
bereaved patients aged between 20-40 who referred to counseling and treatment 
centers and psychiatric clinics in Tehran in 2015. Bereaved patients were 
identified through convenient random sampling method amongst patients and based 
on clinical diagnosis of psychiatrist treating patients. Thirty four persons 
were chosen and were randomly assigned in two 17- persons experimental and 
control groups. Both groups were evaluated at two stages of pre-test and 
post-test through anxiety scale (Spielberger STAI-y 1970) and life expectancy 
(Schneider, 1991).
FINDINGS: Conducted investigation shows that the average life expectancy in the 
experimental group has increased from 12.40 to 23.30 after acceptance and 
commitment therapy. Moreover, the average of anxiety scores in the experimental 
group has decreased in post-test from 121.20 to 79.10 after acceptance and 
commitment therapy. Results of covariance analysis revealed that the 
experimental group subjects experienced a significant lower level of anxiety 
than those in control group (p<0.001). Furthermore, the life expectancy has 
significantly increased in the experimental group (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Inefficient beliefs (illogical), intellectual faults and cognitive 
distortions have reduced, and these in turn cause a reduction in anxiety. In 
this way bereaved patients' life expectancy has increased.
CONCLUSION: The acceptance and commitment therapy has led to the anxiety 
reduction and caused an increase in bereaved patients' life expectancy.

Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), sub-types of non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both present unique features at the genome, epigenome, 
transcriptome and proteome levels, as well as shared clinical and 
histopathological characteristics, but differ in terms of treatment. To ensure 
proper treatment, one must be able to distinguish between these sub-types. Here, 
we identify novel biomarker proteins in NSCLC, allowing for distinguishing 
between the AC and SCC sub-types. Proteomics analysis distinguished between 
healthy and tumor tissues, with the expression level of 1,494 proteins being 
altered, 378 of which showed a ≥|100|-fold change. Enrichment of proteins 
related to protein synthesis and degradation, and of proteins associated with 
mitochondria, metabolism, and apoptosis, was found. Network analysis defined 
groups of proteins, such as those associated with cell metabolic processes or 
with fatty acid/lipid metabolism and transport. Several biomarkers that enable 
for distinguishing between AC and SCC were identified here for the first time, 
and together with previous reports confirmed here, led us to propose a list of 
proteins differentially expressed in SCC and AC. Some of these biomarkers are 
clear signatures for AC or SCC and four of them are secreted proteins. The 
presence of the mitochondrial protein SMAC/Diablo in the nucleus was found to be 
a signature for SCC. Precise diagnosis of AC and SCC is essential for selecting 
appropriate treatment and thus, increasing patient life expectancy. Finally, the 
search for drugs that target some of these biomarkers may lead to new treatments 
for lung cancer.

(1)Department of Orthopaedics, Taizhou First People's Hospital, Taizhou, 318020, 
China.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) are prevalent, devastating for quality 
and expectancy of life, and cause heavy economic burdens. Stem cell therapies 
hold promise in complete structural and functional restoration of SCI.
OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the methods currently used to evaluate the 
stem cell therapies for SCI.
RESULTS: Various kinds of stem cells involving embryonic stem cells (ESCs), bone 
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs) and induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs) are extensively used in regenerative research of SCI. For 
evaluation, the survival and integration of transplanted cells, spinal cord 
reconstruction and functional recovery all should be considered. Histological 
and histochemistrical, microscopic, and colorimetric assays, and real-time 
RT-PCR techniques are applied to determine the outcome. From the three main 
aspects-transplanted cells, spinal cord structure, and functional recovery-we 
summarize and discuss these methods with certain instances of applications in 
SCI models. Importantly, for the evaluations of function, neuronal transmitting, 
electrophysiological analysis and behavioral score are included.
CONCLUSION: Wider conjunction of established technologies, as well as the 
further development of nondestructive methods might make a big difference in 
testing stem cell therapies.

For the first time in 2017 adults with CHD was included in the World Congress of 
Pediatric Cardiology & Cardiac Surgery. With growing numbers and more complex 
patients reaching adulthood, there is a growing need for more attention to this 
subspecialty. Although survival is excellent and now over 90% of patients reach 
adulthood, many have residual problems and complications. Heart failure and 
arrhythmias are most commonly encountered. Life-expectancy is nearly normal for 
mild lesions, but remains reduced in moderate-complex lesions and 
re-interventions are often needed. As most patients want to live a normal life, 
sports participation and pregnancy become very important issues. Finally, 
although innovative treatments are being developed, including for end-stage 
heart failure, we have to refine strategies for optimal care, including during 
the end-stage lives of our patients. This article provides an overview of a 
selection of topics in the field of adults with CHD presented during the 2017 
Seventh World Congress of Pediatric Cardiology & Cardiac Surgery (WCPCCS) in 
Barcelona.

Life expectancy is increasing and, so, the years that patients have to live with 
chronic diseases and co-morbidities. Type 2 diabetes is one of the most 
prevalent chronic diseases, specifically linked to being overweight and ages 
over sixty. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of new strategies 
to delay and even prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes by a combination of 
active and healthy lifestyle on cohorts of mid to high risk subjects. 
Prospective research has been driven on large groups of the population to build 
risk scores that aim to obtain a rule for the classification of patients 
according to the odds for developing the disease. Currently, there are more than 
two hundred models and risk scores for doing this, but a few have been properly 
evaluated in external groups and integrated into a clinical application for 
decision support. In this paper, we present a novel system architecture based on 
service choreography and hybrid modeling, which enables a distributed 
integration of clinical databases, statistical and mathematical engines and web 
interfaces to be deployed in a clinical setting. The system was assessed during 
an eight-week continuous period with eight endocrinologists of a hospital who 
evaluated up to 8080 patients with seven different type 2 diabetes risk models 
implemented in two mathematical engines. Throughput was assessed as a matter of 
technical key performance indicators, confirming the reliability and efficiency 
of the proposed architecture to integrate hybrid artificial intelligence tools 
into daily clinical routine to identify high risk subjects.

Essential tremor (ET) is the most common type of tremor in adults. While ET does 
not result in decreased life expectancy, the disabilities associated with ET can 
have a significant impact on quality of life, mood, functional activities, and 
socialization. Patients suffering from ET not sufficiently treated with first 
line medications may be eligible for alternative strategies such as deep brain 
stimulation, radiofrequency ablation, and MRI guided focused ultrasound 
(MRgFUS). High-intensity MRgFUS is an emerging modality to treat ET, its 
attraction for patients being that it is noninvasive and associated with short 
recovery time, as patients are home the day after treatment. While MRgFUS 
centers are still limited, it will become important for clinicians to consider 
MRgFUS as a treatment alternative, particularly in the case of a patient for 
whom open surgery is contraindicated. This article outlines the steps of patient 
selection, equipment setup, sonication, and post-treatment follow-up, as well as 
critical steps to be aware of when performing a MRgFUS procedure.

04050, Ukraine.

OBJECTIVE: Determination of serum cortisol level in the initial period of acute 
leukemia in children, who exposed to ion izing radiation and other factors of 
Chornobyl accident, depending on their age and prognosis of disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 283 children residents of Kyiv, 
Zhytomyr and Chernihiv regions. There were 90 acute leukemia patients(AL) (ALL - 
56, AML - 34), and 193 people of comparison group with anemia, leukemoid 
reactions and lymphadenopathy. We analyzed the type of comorbid somatic 
pathology, diseases in the genealogy, hematological parameters, cortisol levels 
in blood serum and irradiation doses in all children. In patients with AL 
expected median survival was calculated.
RESULTS: In 28.9 % of AL children the initial cortisol content was below 200 
nmol/l, in 7.8 % - higher than 500 nmol/l (in the comparison group 10.4 % and 
17.1 % respectively). Among AL patients with cortisol levels below 200 nmol/l 
were significantly less amount of persons with chronic bacterial infections and 
persistent viral infections (CMV, EBV) and in the genealogy of these children 
allergic reactions, endocrine pathology diagnosed more often compared with 
patients, whose hormone levels was higher than 200 nmol/l (p < 0.05). 
Distribution of children from control group by gradations of cortisol, age 
groups, defined somatic pathology and diseases in genealogy had no difference. 
It is shown, that lower initial blood serum cortisol level in ALL children 
correlates to a greater probability of relapse (Rs = -0,67). In patients with 
AML a direct correlation between cortisol level and median survival was detected 
(Rs = 0,79). Children radiation doses were ranging from 0.08 mSv to 14.9 mSv, 
and there were slightly higher among residents of Zhytomyr region (8.4 ± 1.2 
mSv) compared to other regions. However, these doses did not affect blood serum 
cortisol levels in children and the course of AL.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the need for correction and individualization of 
corticosteroid doses for optimization of AL patients treatment. Children, who 
have lower than normative serum cortisol levels are at increased risk of hema 
tologic pathology and they need for hematologic monitoring.

Diabetes affects mortality and cognitive functioning. It is not known how 
diabetes influences life expectancy (LE) with and without cognitive impairment. 
We seek to examine age at onset of cognitive impairment and life expectancy (LE) 
with and without cognitive impairment by diabetes status among middle- and 
older-aged Americans. Data come from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study 
2000-2012 linked to the National Death Index (N = 13,687). We use multinomial 
regression models stratified by gender and controlling for age, education and 
race/ethnicity to estimate diabetes-status specific transition probabilities, 
then use a Markov chain matrix population model to calculate age at onset of 
cognitive impairment and LE with and without cognitive impairment by diabetes 
status at age 50. LE at age 50 was 27.6 (men) and 32.1 (women). From age 50, 
those with diabetes had a first incidence of cognitive impairment 3 (men) and 4 
(women) years earlier than those without. Diabetes reduced total LE by 5-7 years 
and cognitively healthy LE by 4-6 years. Those with diabetes lived one year less 
in a cognitively impaired state than those without. Over 80% of the lower LE 
associated with diabetes is attributable to the loss of cognitively-healthy 
years. Those with diabetes have a shorter LE with cognitive impairment because 
of higher mortality. In analyses by educational attainment, education was 
strongly protective of cognitive health, yet diabetes was associated with lower 
age of cognitive impairment onset and fewer cognitive healthy years lived in all 
educational groups. The excess mortality because of diabetes may be decreasing. 
If the mortality decline is not coupled with a comparable decline in the risk of 
cognitive impairment, the population level burden of impaired cognition may grow 
larger.

BACKGROUND: Early child weight gain predicts adolescent and adult obesity, 
underscoring the need to determine early risk factors affecting weight status 
and how risk factors might be mitigated. Socioeconomic status, food insecurity, 
caregiver depressive symptomology, single parenthood, and dysfunctional 
parenting each have been linked to early childhood weight status. However, the 
associations between these risk factors and children's weight status may be 
moderated by caregiver feeding styles (CFS). Examining modifiable factors 
buffering risk could provide key information to guide early obesity intervention 
efforts.
METHODS: This analysis used baseline data from the Growing Healthy project that 
recruited caregivers/child dyads (N = 626) from Michigan Head Start programs. 
Caregivers were primarily non-Hispanic white (62%) and African American (30%). 
After using latent class analysis to identify classes of familial psychosocial 
risk, CFS was tested as a moderator of the association between familial 
psychosocial risk class and child body mass index (BMI) z-score.
RESULTS: Latent class analysis identified three familial psychosocial risk 
classes: (1) poor, food insecure and depressed families; (2) poor, single parent 
families; and (3) low risk families. Interactive effects for uninvolved feeding 
styles and risk group indicated that children in poor, food insecure, and 
depressed families had higher BMI z-scores compared to children in the low risk 
group. Authoritative feeding styles in low risk and poor, food insecure, and 
depressed families showed lower child BMI z-scores relative to poor, single 
parent families with authoritative feeding styles.
CONCLUSIONS: Uninvolved feeding styles intensified the risk and an authoritative 
feeding style muted the risk conferred by living in a poor, food-insecure, and 
depressed family. Interventions that promote responsive feeding practices could 
help decrease the associations of familial psychosocial risks with early child 
weight outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco dependence remains the leading preventable cause of death in 
the developed world. Smokers are disproportionately from lower socioeconomic 
groups, and may use the hospital emergency department (ED) as an important 
source of care. A recent clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of a 
multicomponent intervention to help smokers quit, but the independent 
contributions of those components is unknown.
METHODS: This is a full-factorial (16-arm) randomized trial in a busy hospital 
ED of 4 tobacco dependence interventions: brief motivational interviewing, 
nicotine replacement therapy, referral to a telephone quitline, and a texting 
program. The trial utilizes the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and a 
novel mixed methods analytic design to assess clinical efficacy, cost 
effectiveness, and qualitative participant feedback. The primary endpoint is 
tobacco abstinence at 3months, verified by participants' exhaled carbon 
monoxide.
RESULTS: Study enrollment began in February 2017. As of April 2017, 52 of 1056 
planned participants (4.9%) were enrolled. Telephone-based semi-structured 
participant interviews and in-person biochemical verification of smoking 
abstinence are completed at the 3-month follow-up. Efficacy and cost 
effectiveness analyses will be conducted after follow-up is completed.
DISCUSSION: The goal of this study is to identify a clinically efficacious, 
cost-effective intervention package for the initial treatment of tobacco 
dependence in ED patients. The efficacy of this combination can then be tested 
in a subsequent confirmatory trial. Our approach incorporates qualitative 
feedback from study participants in evaluating which intervention components 
will be tested in the future trial.
