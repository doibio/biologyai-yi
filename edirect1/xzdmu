analytical strategy for labelling 11 IgGs has been investigated using 2 
different IgG1 constructs and applying 7 different types of labels. Each 
labelling resulted in a change in the physicochemical properties of the protein. 
Not only can the DoL of modified IgGs lead to a change in protein properties, 
but the type of label also can. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the 
labelling process can also influence the behaviour of labelled mAbs. An 
identical label on different constructs of IgG1 can cause different affinities 
for FcRn and heparin. Considering the assessment data, only 6 of the 11 modified 
antibodies from this study can be recommended for subsequent experiments. In 
conclusion, a suitability assessment of labelled antibodies prior to any 
pharmacokinetic studies is essential to reduce cost, allocate resources and 
reduce the number of animal experiments during pre-clinical drug development.

The burden of disease attributable to exposure to heavy metals via drinking 
water in Iran (2019) was assessed at the national and regional levels. The 
non-carcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and attributable burden of disease of 
heavy metals in drinking water were estimated in terms of hazard quotient (HQ), 
incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), and disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY), respectively. The average drinking water concentrations of arsenic (As), 
cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and nickel (Ni) in Iran 
were determined to be 2.3, 0.4, 12.1, 2.5, 0.7, and 19.7 μg/L, respectively, 
which were much lower than the standard values. The total average HQs of heavy 
metals in drinking water in the entire country, rural, and urban communities 
were 0.48, 0.65 and 0.45, respectively. At the national level, the average ILCRs 
of heavy metal in the entire country were in the following order: 1.06 × 10-4 
for As, 5.89 × 10-5 for Cd, 2.05 × 10-5 for Cr, and 3.76 × 10-7 for Pb. The 
cancer cases, deaths, death rate (per 100,000 people), DALYs, and DALY rate (per 
100,000 people) attributed to exposure to heavy metals in drinking water at the 
national level were estimated to be 213 (95% uncertainty interval: 180 to 254), 
87 (73-104), 0.11 (0.09-0.13), 4642 (3793-5489), and 5.81 (4.75-6.87), 
respectively. The contributions of exposure to As, Cd, Cr, and Pb in the 
attributable burden of disease were 14.7%, 65.7%, 19.3%, and 0.2%, respectively. 
The regional distribution of the total attributable DALY rate for all heavy 
metals was as follows: Region 5> Region 4> Region 1> Region 3> Region 2. The 
investigation and improvement of relatively high exceedance of As levels in 
drinking water from the standard value, especially in Regions 5 and 3 as well as 
biomonitoring of heavy metals throughout the country were recommended.

BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) frequently remains 
uncontrolled despite maximal medical therapy and sinonasal surgery, presenting 
several unmet needs and challenges. Omalizumab previously demonstrated efficacy 
in CRSwNP in duplicate phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (POLYP 1, 
POLYP 2).
OBJECTIVE: This open-label extension evaluated the continued efficacy, safety, 
and durability of response of omalizumab in adults with CRSwNP who completed 
POLYP 1 or 2.
METHODS: After 24 weeks of omalizumab or placebo in POLYP 1 and 2, patients (n = 
249) received open-label omalizumab plus background nasal mometasone therapy for 
28 weeks and were subsequently followed for 24 weeks after omalizumab 
discontinuation. Efficacy end points assessed change from baseline for the 
coprimary end points, Nasal Polyp Score and Nasal Congestion Score, and the 
secondary end points of Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22, Total Nasal Symptom Score 
and its components, and University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test 
scores. Safety objectives included incidence of adverse events and adverse 
events leading to omalizumab discontinuation.
RESULTS: Patients who continued omalizumab experienced further improvements 
across coprimary end points and secondary end points through 52 weeks. Patients 
who switched from placebo to omalizumab experienced favorable responses across 
end points through week 52 that were similar to POLYP 1 and 2 at week 24. After 
omalizumab discontinuation, scores gradually worsened over the 24-week 
follow-up, but remained improved from pretreatment levels for both groups. The 
safety profile was similar to previous reports.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety profile from this study supports extended 
omalizumab treatment up to 1 year for CRSwNP with inadequate response to nasal 
corticosteroids.

BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) shortens time to 
functional recovery and improves 30-day quality of life (QoL), as compared with 
open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) for nonmalignant disease. The impact of MIDP on 
QoL, cosmetic satisfaction, and overall major complications beyond 1-year 
follow-up is currently unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: The Minimally Invasive Versus Open Distal Pancreatectomy (LEOPARD) 
trial randomized 108 patients to MIDP (laparoscopic or robotic) or ODP in 14 
Dutch centers (April 2015 to March 2017). The primary outcome measure of this 
study was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), as assessed with the EQ-5D. QoL 
was assessed using subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, PAN-26, and a body image 
questionnaire. The latter included a cosmetic satisfaction score (range 3-24), 
and a body image score (range 5-20). Differences between MIDP and ODP for QALYs, 
generic, and disease-specific QoL and body image were analyzed. Missing QoL data 
were imputed using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: In total, 84 patients were alive, with a median follow-up of 44 months; 
62 of these patients (74%) completed the questionnaires (27 MIDP, 35 ODP). There 
was no significant difference in QALYs between the 2 groups (mean score 2.34 vs 
2.46 years, p = 0.63), nor on the QoL subscales. Significant overall change in 
EQ-5D health utilities were found for both groups over time (p < 0.001). 
Patients in the MIDP group scored higher on cosmetic satisfaction (21 vs 14, p = 
0.049). No differences between the 2 groups were observed for clinical outcomes 
such as major complications, readmissions, and incisional hernias.
CONCLUSIONS: More than 3 years after distal pancreatectomy, no improvement in 
QALYs and overall QoL was seen after MIDP, whereas cosmetic satisfaction was 
higher after MIDP as compared with ODP.

Development and health during calfhood are paramount for the success of dairy 
operations because they are associated with longevity and productivity later in 
life. Thus, provision of nutritional supplements has been explored as an 
alternative to improve growth of preweaned calves. Holstein calves (female = 
472, male = 46) from 2 dairies located in the San Joaquin Valley were assigned 
randomly to receive 25 g/d of Gammulin (APC Inc.) from 2 to 24 d of age (GAM = 
263) or to receive no supplementation (control = 255). Calves were fed a mixture 
of waste milk and milk replacer (3.79 L/d), and study personnel added the 
supplement to the bottles of calves in the GAM treatment daily. Study personnel 
monitored calves 6 d/wk and recorded starter intake, fecal score (1 = firm, 4 = 
watery), and attitude score (1 = alert and responsive, 4 = recumbent). Blood 
samples were collected (4, 7, 14, 26, 44, 56, and 68 d of age) to determine 
concentrations of total protein, glucose (n = 64), nonesterified fatty acids (n 
= 64), β-hydroxybutyrate (n = 171), and hematocrit (n = 518). Calves (n = 64) 
were treated with 0.5 mg of ovalbumin at 3, 21, and 42 d of age, and 
concentration of anti-ovalbumin IgG was measured. The percentage of 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes positive for phagocytosis and oxidative burst after 
the ex vivo exposure to an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli was evaluated (n = 
64). We followed the female calves through the end of the first lactation or 
until they left the herd to evaluate the effect of treatment on first-lactation 
performance. Treatment did not affect metabolic and immune responses. During the 
supplementation (1 to 24 d of age), starter intake did not differ between 
treatments, but the GAM treatment reduced starter intake (638.5 ± 1.1 vs. 696.6 
± 1.1 g/d; mean ± standard error of the mean) from 25 to 60 d of age and average 
daily gain (798.8 ± 15.4 and 749.5 ± 15.2) from 23 to 60 d of age, resulting in 
reduced body weight at 60 d of age (68.4 ± 0.4 vs. 69.8 ± 0.5 kg). From 1 to 24 
d of age, GAM treatment reduced the number of days calves had fecal score = 4 
(ratio of number of days = 0.92; 95% confidence interval = 0.84-1.00) and it 
reduced the number of electrolyte treatments calves received (ratio of number of 
treatments = 0.92; 95% confidence interval = 0.85-0.99). Treatment did not 
affect the hazard of first calving and first-lactation 305-d milk yield, but the 
adjusted hazard ratio (0.82; 95% confidence interval = 0.65, 1.04) of pregnancy 
in the first lactation tended to be reduced for the GAM treatment. In the 
conditions of this experiment, supplementation with 25 g/d of GAM to the liquid 
feed from 2 to 24 d of age did not improve calfhood health and performance.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) decreases life expectancy 
and impairs health related quality of life (HR-QOL). Revascularisation is needed 
to relieve ischaemia and salvage limbs. Although a major goal of CLTI treatment 
is maintaining QOL, little information is available about changes of HR-QOL over 
time after revascularisation. HR-QOL with survival after revascularisation for 
CLTI was assessed.
METHODS: The clinical database of the Surgical reconstruction versus Peripheral 
INtervention in pAtients with critical limb isCHemia (SPINACH), a prospective 
multicentre observational study, was analysed. Outcome measures were disease 
specific QOL per the Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQOL) questionnaire and the 
Short Form (SF) 36 evaluated generic QOL, which were assessed at baseline and 
three, 12, 24, and 36 months. The outcome measure was change of QOL from 
baseline. The minimally important difference (half a standard deviation from 
baseline) was used as the cut off point for improved, worsened, and unchanged 
QOL.
RESULTS: Overall QOL was improved in 61% of patients for the VascuQOL and 
approximately 40% for the SF-36 component summaries at three months. However, 
these proportion gradually decreased to 21% - 31% at three years. In contrast, 
the proportion of deceased patients gradually increased over the three year 
follow up. Multivariable analysis revealed that pre-operative non-ambulatory 
status was inversely associated with improved QOL for the three month VascuQOL 
and SF-36 mental component summary, and surgical reconstruction was positively 
associated with these measurements. Advanced age and renal failure were 
inversely associated with improved QOL for the SF-36 mental component summary 
and VascuQOL at one to three years.
CONCLUSION: Revascularisation improved QOL. However, patients with 
non-ambulatory status exhibited a negative association with improved QOL at 
three months, and advanced age and renal failure limited benefits one to three 
years after revascularisation. Accumulating QOL data will be essential for 
post-revascularisation QOL estimation. Pre-operative assessment, including 
estimated QOL, is important in shared decision making for patient oriented 
outcomes in the treatment of CLTI patients.

POLICY POLARIZATION AND DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES.

Montez JK(1).

and Co Director of the Policy, Place, and Population Health Lab at Syracuse 
University.

The United States currently ranks last among high-income countries for life 
expectancy. Since 2014, U.S. life expectancy has declined. By now, these 
alarming trends are well known to researchers, the public, and policymakers. 
Nevertheless, there is no consensus among researchers on the causes of the 
trends, and there has been no serious and effective bipartisan effort to solve 
the problem. The dominant narrative has implicated Americans' behaviors, such as 
smoking, illicit drug use, and suicide; yet, this narrative is misguided and 
counterproductive. It also exonerates the key structural drivers of behaviors 
and health, namely the U.S. policy context and the outsized influence of 
corporations and big donors on those policies. The U.S. policy context has 
changed dramatically since the 1970s, particularly at the state level. State 
policies have hyperpolarized along partisan lines. These changes have likely had 
a profound impact on nearly every aspect of Americans' lives, cutting short many 
of them. Consequently, this Essay argues that state policies increasingly affect 
life and death in the United States. It raises concerns about how the 
polarization of state policies will further deteriorate the health of many 
Americans. It points to three significant forces behind the polarization and the 
growing importance of state policy contexts on Americans' lives-(1) New 
Federalism; (2) the new type of state preemption laws; and (3) the emergence of 
organizations, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, through which 
corporations and big donors influence policies.

Frailty prevention is a cornerstone for the extension of healthy life 
expectancy. It is a multi-dimensional construct that includes physical, mental, 
and social aspects. Frailty is reversible and can be attenuated by intervention; 
therefore, its early detection is important in primary and community care. The 
mainstream of disability prevention in Japan, which comprises the Japanese and 
local governments as well as healthcare workers, was a high-risk approach until 
2014. Given the revision on Japan's long-term care insurance law, current ageing 
health policies have shifted to more population centric approach. Implements 
group activities called "Kayoi-no-ba" has been valued in Japan as disability 
prevention initiative. The Kihon Checklist - a 25-item questionnaire - has been 
broadly used by health experts and researchers to assess frailty in Japan. 
However, a new 15-item questionnaire has been newly developed to identify 
frailty and other health-related problems in older people of 75 years and above. 
This will enable providing the necessary support to frail individuals at any 
healthcare facility in local communities. The increase in frailty prevalence in 
older people has been concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Home-based physical 
exercise programs are expected to be effective for frailty prevention. 
Utilization of information and communication technologies, social network 
services, and video calls has attracted attention for being effective tools to 
facilitate communication for older people during the pandemic. Further, life 
course approaches are needed to clarify the midlife risk of frailty development 
in later life.

BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI) or Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome is 
a rare genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of arylsulphatase B. The 
resultant accumulation of dermatan sulphate causes lysosomal damage. The 
clinical symptoms are related to skeletal dysplasia (i.e. short stature and 
degenerative joint disease). Other manifestations include cardiac disease, 
impaired pulmonary function, ophthalmological complications, hepatosplenomegaly, 
sinusitis, otitis, hearing loss and sleep apnea. Intellectual impairment is 
generally absent. Clinical manifestation is typically by two or three years of 
age; however, slowly progressive cases may not present until adulthood. Enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) with galsulfase is considered a new approach for 
treating MPS VI.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treating MPS VI by ERT 
with galsulfase compared to other interventions, placebo or no intervention.
SEARCH METHODS: Eletronic searches were performed on the Cystic Fibrosis and 
Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Date of 
the latest search:  09 June 2021. Further searches of the following databases 
were also performed: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, the Journal of Inherited 
Metabolic Disease, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials 
Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Date of the latest search: 20 August 
2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical studies 
of ERT with galsulfase compared to other interventions or placebo.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the studies, 
assessed the risk of bias, extracted data and assessed the certainty of the the 
evidence using the GRADE criteria.
MAIN RESULTS: One study was included involving 39 participants who received 
either ERT with galsulfase (recombinant human arylsulphatase B) or placebo. This 
small study was considered overall to have an unclear risk of bias in relation 
to the design and implementation of the study, since the authors did not report 
how both the allocation generation and concealment were performed. Given the 
very low certainty of the evidence, we are uncertain whether at 24 weeks there 
was a difference between groups in relation to the 12-minute walk test, mean 
difference (MD) of 92.00 meters (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.00 to 172.00), 
or the three-minute stair climb, MD 5.70 (95% CI -0.10 to 11.50). In relation to 
respiratory tests, we are uncertain whether galsulfase makes any difference as 
compared to placebo in forced vital capacity in litres (FVC (L) (absolute change 
in baseline), given the very low certainty of the evidence. Cardiac function was 
not reported in the included study. We found that galsulfase, as compared to 
placebo, may decrease urinary glycosaminoglycan levels at 24 weeks, MD -227.00 
(95% CI -264.00 to -190.00) (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether 
there are differences between the galsulfase and placebo groups in relation to 
adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). In general, the dose of galsulfase 
was well tolerated and there were no differences between groups. These events 
include drug-related adverse events, serious and severe adverse events, those 
during infusion, drug-related adverse events during infusion, and deaths. More 
infusion-related reactions were observed in the galsulfase group and were 
managed with interruption or slowing of infusion rate or administration of 
antihistamines or corticosteroids drugs. No deaths occurred during the study.   
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review are based only on one small 
study (a 24-week randomised phase of the study and prior to the open-label 
extension). We are uncertain whether galsulfase is more effective than placebo, 
for treating people with MPS VI, in relation to the 12-minute walk test or the 
three-minute stair climb, as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as 
very low. We found that galsulfase may reduce urinary glycosaminoglycans levels. 
We are also uncertain whether there are any differences between treatment groups 
in relation to cardiac or pulmonary functions, liver or spleen volume, overnight 
apnea-hypopnea, height and weight, quality of life and adverse effects. Further 
studies are needed to obtain more information on the long-term effectiveness and 
safety of ERT with galsulfase.

African American men have the lowest life expectancy of any ethnic gender group 
in the USA. Furthermore, these men endorse having a lower health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) than any other group. There have been recent calls from national 
organizations to improve HRQoL-a multidimensional indicator of health strongly 
associated with mortality and morbidity. Following these calls, there have been 
widespread efforts implemented to improve HRQoL among the US population, though 
no known effort has been implemented that is tailored to the unique experiences 
of African American men. Health promotion efforts that are not tailored to the 
unique preferences and experiences of these men are likely to produce limited 
results. Formative research conducted among African American men is needed in 
order to design and implement an effective HRQoL-promoting intervention for 
African American men. The present study constitutes such formative research and 
was conducted with a sample of 211 African American men. Hierarchical 
regressions were performed to understand the role of literature-derived 
predictors of HRQoL among these men. Results found that depression, stress, and 
physical activity were found to be significant predictors of HRQoL among these 
men. This is the first known study to examine predictors of HRQoL among African 
American men-a group that disproportionately experiences health disparities and 
low HRQoL, though for who few successful health promotions exist. The findings 
from this study have implications for those seeking to design and implement 
HRQoL-promoting interventions among African American men.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure and compare the burden of disease 
of COVID-19 pandemic in 16 EU/EEA countries through the estimation of 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) over a long period of time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The observational study was based on data from ECDC and 
WHO databases collected from 27 January 2020 to 15 November 2020. In addition to 
the absolute number of DALYs, a weekly trend of DALYs/100,000 inhabitants was 
computed for each country to assess the evolution of the pandemic burden over 
time. A cluster analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test were performed to 
allow for a country-to-country comparison.
RESULTS: The total DALYs amount to 4,354 per 100.000 inhabitants. YLLs were 
accountable for 98% of total DALYs.  Italy, Czechia and Sweden had the highest 
values of DALYs/100,000 while Finland, Estonia and Slovakia had the lowest. The 
latter three countries differed significantly from the others - in terms of 
DALYs trend over time - as shown by KS test. The cluster analysis allowed for 
the identification of three clusters of countries sharing similar trends of 
DALYs during the assessed period of time. These results show that notable 
differences were observed among different countries, with most of the disease 
burden attributable to YLLs.
CONCLUSIONS: DALYs have proven to be an effective measure of the burden of 
disease. Public health and policy actions, as well as demographic, 
epidemiological and cultural features of each country, may be responsible for 
the wide variations in the health impact that were observed among the countries 
analyzed.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common cause of hospital 
admissions, readmissions, and mortality worldwide. Digital health interventions 
(DHIs) that promote self-management, adherence to guideline-directed therapy, 
and cardiovascular risk reduction may improve health outcomes in this 
population. The "Corrie" DHI consists of a smartphone application, smartwatch, 
and wireless blood pressure monitor to support medication tracking, education, 
vital signs monitoring, and care coordination. We aimed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of this DHI plus standard of care in reducing 30-day 
readmissions among AMI patients in comparison to standard of care alone.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to explore cost-effectiveness from the hospital 
perspective. The time horizon of the analysis was 1 year, with 30-day cycles, 
using inflation-adjusted cost data with no discount rate. Currencies were 
quantified in US dollars, and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). The results were interpreted as an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Univariate 
sensitivity and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: The DHI reduced costs and increased QALYs on average, dominating 
standard of care in 99.7% of simulations in the probabilistic analysis. Based on 
the assumption that the DHI costs $2750 per patient, use of the DHI leads to a 
cost-savings of $7274 per patient compared with standard of care alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this DHI is cost-saving through the 
reduction of risk for all-cause readmission following AMI. DHIs that promote 
improved adherence with guideline-based health care can reduce hospital 
readmissions and associated costs.

Fission yeast is a good model organism for the study of lifespan. To elucidate 
the mechanism, we screened for long-lived mutants. We found a nonsense mutation 
in the ksg1+ gene, which encodes an ortholog of mammalian PDK1 
(phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase). The mutation was in the PH domain 
of Ksg1 and caused defect in membrane localization and protein stability. 
Analysis of the ksg1 mutant revealed that the reduced amounts and/or activity of 
the Ksg1 protein are responsible for the increased lifespan. Ksg1 is essential 
for growth and known to phosphorylate multiple substrates, but the substrate 
responsible for the long-lived phenotype of ksg1 mutation is not yet known. 
Genetic analysis showed that deletion of pck2 suppressed the long-lived 
phenotype of ksg1 mutant, suggesting that Pck2 might be involved in the lifespan 
extension caused by ksg1 mutation.

The prevalence of maternal cardiovascular disease (CVD) has risen throughout the 
developed world, reflecting an increase in acquired cardiovascular risk factors, 
such as hypertension and diabetes, and the improved life expectancy of those 
living with congenital and acquired heart disease owing to advances in care. 
Because many cardiovascular risk factors and conditions are associated with 
infertility, reproductive-age individuals with CVD may increasingly seek 
reproductive assistance. The worldwide use of assisted reproductive technologies 
(ART), such as in vitro fertilisation, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection, or intrauterine insemination after pharmacologic ovulation induction 
have increased steadily over the past several decades. It is incumbent on 
providers who care for reproductive-age individuals with preexisting CVD or CVD 
risk factors to understand and appreciate the types of treatments offered and 
inherent risks related to infertility treatments, in order to guide their 
patients to making safe reproductive choices in line with their values and 
preferences. Infertility treatments increase the risk of complicated pregnancy, 
but whether these risks are compounded among individuals with preexisting CVD is 
less well known. In this review, we summarise current available evidence 
regarding short-term and long-term cardiovascular implications of ART among 
individuals with and without CVD, as well as treatment considerations for these 
individuals. Existing knowledge gaps and priority areas for further study are 
presented.

OBJECTIVE: Estimating the decrease in life expectancy (LE) of the population of 
Madrid and its districts and its relationship with socioeconomic variables in 
the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: Death records were obtained from the Municipal Register of inhabitants 
(Municipal Statistics Service). Based on Chiang II method, life expectancy at 
birth and at 65 years of age (LEB and LE65) were calculated, as well as their 
95% confidence intervals both for men and women and their gross, net and minimum 
falls for each district in 2020 over 2019, their correlation with some 
socioeconomic variables distribution and the existence of multiple linear 
regression explicative models.
RESULTS: In 2020, deaths in Madrid increased by 46.1% compared with the previous 
year, the LEB was 79.31 years in men and 85.25 years in women, meaning a 
decrease of 3.67 and 2.56 years respectively (4.42% and 2.91%). All districts 
registered decreases in LE, with the largest decrease in men in Tetuan (4.72 
years) and in women in Chamartín (3.91 years). The most affected were the 
southern districts, especially in men. Immigrant and people over 80 years old 
rates explained 24% of the drop in LE in men, using linear regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in LE recorded in Madrid and its districts in 2020 is 
bigger than in Spain (1.6 years), takes us back to values of 2002 (LE65) and 
2008 (LEB), has a sharper fall in the south and is territorially unequally 
distributed, according to socioeconomic variables and being associated with some 
of them.

Aging is a complex physiological process that leads to the progressive decline 
of metabolic and immune function, among other biological mechanisms. As global 
life expectancy increases, it is important to understand determinants of healthy 
aging-including environmental and genetic factors-and thus slow the onset or 
progression of age-related disease. Environmental enrichment (EE) is a housing 
environment wherein laboratory animals engage with complex physical and social 
stimulation. EE is a prime model to understand environmental influences on aging 
dynamics, as it confers an antiobesity and anticancer phenotype that has been 
implicated in healthy aging and health span extension. Although EE is frequently 
used to study malignancies in young mice, fewer studies characterize EE-cancer 
outcomes in older mice. Here, we used young (3-month-old) and aged 
(14-month-old) female C57BL/6 mice to determine whether EE would be able to 
mitigate age-related deficiencies in metabolic function and thus alter Lewis 
lung carcinoma (LLC) growth. Overall, EE improved metabolic function, resulting 
in reduced fat mass, increased lean mass, and improved glycemic processing; many 
of these effects were stronger in the aged cohort than in the young cohort, 
indicating an age-driven effect on metabolic responses. In the aged-EE cohort, 
subcutaneously implanted LLC tumor growth was inhibited and tumors exhibited 
alterations in various markers of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, 
inflammation, and malignancy. These results validate EE as an anticancer model 
in aged mice and underscore the importance of understanding environmental 
influences on cancer malignancy in aged populations. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: 
Environmental enrichment (EE) serves as a model of complex physical and social 
stimulation. This study validates EE as an anticancer intervention paradigm in 
aged mice and underscores the importance of understanding environmental 
influences on cancer malignancy in aged populations.

Local fluid shear stress operates a molecular switch to drive fetal semilunar 
valve extension.

University, Ithaca, New York, USA.

USA.

BACKGROUND: While much is known about the genetic regulation of early valvular 
morphogenesis, mechanisms governing fetal valvular growth and remodeling remain 
unclear. Hemodynamic forces strongly influence morphogenesis, but it is unknown 
whether or how they interact with valvulogenic signaling programs. Side-specific 
activity of valvulogenic programs motivates the hypothesis that shear stress 
pattern-specific endocardial signaling controls the elongation of leaflets.
RESULTS: We determined that extension of the semilunar valve occurs via fibrosa 
sided endocardial proliferation. Low OSS was necessary and sufficient to induce 
canonical Wnt/β-catenin activation in fetal valve endothelium, which in turn 
drives BMP receptor/ligand expression, and pSmad1/5 activity essential for 
endocardial proliferation. In contrast, ventricularis endocardial cells 
expressed active Notch1 but minimal pSmad1/5. Endocardial monolayers exposed to 
LSS attenuate Wnt signaling in a Notch1 dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Low OSS is transduced by endocardial cells into canonical Wnt 
signaling programs that regulate BMP signaling and endocardial proliferation. In 
contrast, high LSS induces Notch signaling in endocardial cells, inhibiting Wnt 
signaling and thereby restricting growth on the ventricular surface. Our results 
identify a novel mechanically regulated molecular switch, whereby fluid shear 
stress drives the growth of valve endothelium, orchestrating the extension of 
the valve in the direction of blood flow.

BACKGROUND: Long-term prognostication is important to inform preventive care in 
older adults. Existing prediction indices incorporate age and comorbidities. 
Frailty is another important factor in prognostication. In this project, we 
aimed at developing life expectancy estimates that incorporate both 
comorbidities and frailty.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data from a 5% sample of 
Medicare beneficiaries with and without history of cancer from Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry areas. We included adults 
aged 66-95 years who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare for 
≥1 year from 1998 to 2014. Participants were followed for survival until 
12/31/2015, death, or disenrollment. Comorbidity (none, low/medium, high) and 
frailty categories (low, high) were defined using established methods for 
claims. We estimated 5- and 10-year survival probabilities and median life 
expectancies by age, sex, comorbidities, and frailty.
RESULTS: The study included 479,646 individuals (4,128,316 person-years), of 
whom most were women (58.7%). Frailty scores varied widely among participants in 
the same comorbidity category. In Cox models, both comorbidities and frailty 
were independent predictors of mortality. Individuals with high comorbidities 
(HR, 3.24; 95% CI, 3.20-3.28) and low/medium comorbidities (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 
1.34-1.39) had higher risks of death than those with no comorbidities. Compared 
to low frailty, high frailty was associated with higher risk of death (HR, 1.55; 
95% CI, 1.52-1.58). Frailty affected life expectancy estimates in ways relevant 
to preventive care (i.e., distinguishing <10-year versus >10-year life 
expectancy) in multiple subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating both comorbidities and frailty may be important in 
estimating long-term life expectancies of older adults. Our life expectancy 
tables can aid clinicians' prognostication and inform simulation models and 
population health management.
