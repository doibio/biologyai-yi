Therapy-General significantly improved post-exercise interventions (P=0.037). 
There were significant improvements in the QoL subdomains of emotional 
well-being and physical, social, and cognitive functions.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise interventions are feasible and safe in patients with 
metastatic cancer. Exercise interventions can improve QoL and prevent skeletal 
muscle loss during palliative chemotherapy.

IMPORTANCE: The past 4 decades have seen substantial changes in allogeneic blood 
or marrow transplantation (BMT) practice, with the overarching goal of expanding 
the eligible patient pool while optimizing disease-free survival.
OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in life expectancy and cause-specific late 
mortality after allogeneic BMT performed over a 40-year period.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of 4741 
individuals who lived 2 or more years after allogeneic BMT performed between 
January 1, 1974, and December 31, 2014, was conducted at City of Hope, 
University of Minnesota, or University of Alabama at Birmingham. The end of 
follow-up was March 23, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Allogeneic BMT performed in 3 eras: 1974-1989, 1990-2004, and 
2005-2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause, recurrence-related, and 
nonrecurrence-related mortality and projected reduction in life expectancy. 
Information regarding vital status and cause of death was obtained from the 
National Death Index Plus and Accurint databases.
RESULTS: Of the 4741 individuals included in the study, 2735 (57.7%) were male; 
median age at BMT was 33 years (range, 0-75 years). The cumulative incidence of 
recurrence-related mortality plateaued at 10 years, reaching 12.2% (95% CI, 
11.0%-13.4%) at 30 years from BMT. In contrast, the incidence of 
nonrecurrence-related mortality continued to increase and was 22.3% (95% CI, 
20.4%-24.3%) at 30 years. Leading causes of nonrecurrence-related mortality 
included infection (30-year cumulative incidence, 10.7%; standardized mortality 
ratio [SMR], 52.0), subsequent malignant neoplasms (30-year cumulative 
incidence, 7.0%; SMR, 4.8), cardiovascular disease (30-year cumulative 
incidence, 4.6%; SMR, 4.1), and pulmonary disease (30-year cumulative incidence, 
2.7%; SMR, 13.9). Compared with the general population, the relative mortality 
remained higher at 30 or more years after BMT (SMR, 5.4; 95% CI, 4.0-7.1). The 
cohort experienced a 20.8% reduction in life expectancy (8.7 years of life 
lost). Compared with 1974-1989 (reference), the adjusted 10-year hazard ratio 
(HR) of all-cause mortality declined over the 3 eras (1990-2004: HR, 0.67; 95% 
CI, 0.53-0.85; 2005-2014: HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39-0.69; P < .001 for trend), as 
did years of life lost (1974-1989: 9.9 years [reference]; 1990-2004: 6.5 years; 
and 2005-2014: 4.2 years). The reduction in late mortality was most pronounced 
among individuals who underwent transplantation at ages younger than 18 years 
(1990-2004: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.96; 2005-2014: HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16-0.54; 
reference: 1974-1989; P < .001 for trend) and those who received bone marrow 
(1990-2004: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90; 2005-2014: HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.69; 
reference: 1974-1989; P < .001 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study noted that late mortality among 
recipients of allogeneic BMT has decreased over the past 40 years; however, life 
expectancy was not restored to expected rates compared with the general US 
population. Furthermore, the reduction in risk of late mortality appeared to be 
confined to those who underwent transplantation at a younger age or those who 
received bone marrow. Further efforts to mitigate disease recurrence, 
infections, subsequent neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary disease 
may be useful in this population.

Mucuri, Campus JK - Diamantina, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: Although commonly prescribed, exercise therapy alone is insufficient 
for the treatment of low back pain (LBP). Thus, studies recommend a combination 
of interventions. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) involving low-level laser is 
an effective intervention for relieving LBP; however, scientific evidence on the 
effects of laser therapy combined with exercise therapy is scarce and 
contradictory. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the short-term and 
long-term effects of the combination of PBMT and an exercise protocol in 
individuals with persistent nonspecificLBP.
METHODS: This 2-armed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with blinded 
participants, assessors, and therapists will be conducted in the outpatient 
physical therapy clinic of a university in Diamantina, Brazil. Participants are 
90 individuals between 18 and 65 years of age with self-reported LBP. The 
participants will be randomly allocated to (1) a 6-week exercise program 
combined with active PBMT at a frequency of twice per week, totaling 12 sessions 
(n = 45), or (2) a 6-week exercise program combined with placebo PBMT (n = 45). 
Clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline as well as at 8 and 20 weeks and 
12 months after randomization. The primary outcomes will be pain intensity and 
disability. The secondary outcomes will be mental health, mobility, disability, 
and strength of the trunk extensor muscles.
IMPACT: The findings will help determine whether adding PBMT to a physical 
therapist-supervised exercise protocol is more effective than the exercise 
protocol alone for persistent LBP. This study has the potential to guide 
clinical practice toward innovative ways of providing health care.

Program, Cecil College, North East, Maryland, USA.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the health of people from 
communities of color and people of limited socioeconomic means in a 
disproportionate way due to social determinants of health (SDoH). The Centers 
for Disease Control defines SDoH as the "conditions in the places where people 
live, learn, work, and play that affect a wide range of health and quality-of 
life-risks and outcomes." A related construct, social determinants of learning 
(SDoL), includes contextual conditions and variables that impact students' 
ability to optimally participate in their education, including academic and 
clinical development. SDoL directly impact students' ability to participate in 
the educational process. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students struggling with 
SDoH and, by extension SDoL, may be more likely to have sick family members, 
caregiving responsibilities, food and housing insecurity, and obligations to 
supplement lost family wages. SDoL are also influenced by individual experiences 
within and outside of the classroom. Beyond bringing this matter to the 
attention of our profession, especially clinical and academic educators, we must 
take action to reach and support students who are at higher academic risk due to 
the SDoL. The purpose of this paper is to (1) define SDoL, (2) explain how SDoL 
are impacting doctor of physical therapy and physical therapist assistant 
students, and (3) discuss actions that physical therapists and physical 
therapist assistants can take to mitigate the effects of SDoL on current doctor 
of physical therapy and physical therapist assistant students.
IMPACT: This Perspective is one of the first explorations of how SDoL affect 
physical therapy students during the pandemic and provides concrete suggestions 
on how educators in both academic and clinical settings can help students 
succeed when they are negatively affected by SDoL.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLHIV) have an elevated risk of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to their uninfected 
peers. Expanding statin use may help alleviate this burden. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of reducing the recommend statin initiation threshold for 
primary ASCVD prevention among PLHIV in Thailand.
METHODS: Our decision analytic microsimulation model randomly selected (with 
replacement) individuals from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (data 
collected between 1/January/2013 and 1/September/2019). Direct medical costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years were assigned in annual cycles over a lifetime 
horizon and discounted at 3% per year. We assumed the Thai healthcare sector 
perspective. The study population included PLHIV aged 35-75 years, without 
ASCVD, and receiving antiretroviral therapy. Statin initiation thresholds 
evaluated were 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10% (control), ≥7.5% and ≥5%.
RESULTS: A statin initiation threshold of ASCVD risk ≥7.5% resulted in 
accumulation of 0.015 additional quality-adjusted life-years compared with an 
ASCVD risk threshold ≥10%, at an extra cost of 3,539 Baht ($US113), giving an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 239,000 Baht ($US7,670)/quality-adjusted 
life-year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing ASCVD risk 
≥5% to ≥7.5% was 349,000 Baht ($US11,200)/quality-adjusted life-year gained. At 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Baht ($US5,135)/quality-adjusted 
life-year gained, a 30.8% reduction in the average cost of low/moderate statin 
therapy led to the ASCVD risk threshold ≥7.5% becoming cost-effective compared 
with current practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the recommended 10-year ASCVD risk threshold for statin 
initiation among PLHIV in Thailand would not currently be cost-effective. 
However, a lower threshold could become cost-effective with greater preference 
for cheaper statins.

BACKGOUND: Major Congenital anomalies are conditions that are severe enough to 
reduce life expectancy or compromise normal function. The introduction of 
prenatal screening for fetal anomalies to mid-trimester ultrasonography allows 
for early detection of many anomalies including the major ones. Once the 
diagnosis is made, the parents have the options of either terminating or 
continuing with the pregnancy after proper counselling. The purpose of this 
study is to determine the pattern of pregnancy termination for major congenital 
anomalies in our hospital after seven years of commencement of the screening 
programme.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which all women who presented for 
prenatal ultrasound screening for fetal anomalies at the University College 
Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria between August 2012 and July 2019 were scanned. Those 
with ultrasound diagnosed major fetal anomalies were counselled on the severity 
of the anomalies and were given the options of either continuing with the 
pregnancy or terminating it. All the data were recorded in a spreadsheet while 
Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM-SPSS version 20 spreadsheet.
RESULTS: During the seven-year period, three thousand, one hundred and twenty 
(3,120) fetuses were screened for fetal anomalies, out of which sixty-one 
(1.95%) had major anomalies. Twenty (32.8%) of the major anomalies were 
terminated at various stages of pregnancy. Anomalies of the central nervous 
system and the musculoskeletal system were the most frequently terminated 
anomalies, each having 8 fetuses. This was followed by anomalies involving more 
than one system which were diagnosed in 3 of the fetuses. All the mothers were 
counselled before the termination of the pregnancies. Nineteen (95%) of the 
anomalies were confirmed after termination.
CONCLUSION: The availability of prenatal ultrasound screening permits precise 
diagnosis of a range of fetal abnormalities, including those incompatible with 
life. Therefore, termination of pregnancies with major anomalies significantly 
contributes to the global decrease in perinatal morbidity and mortality 
associated with birth defects.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: Les anomalies congénitales majeures sont des affections 
suffisamment graves pour réduire l’espérance de vie ou compromettre le 
fonctionnement normal. L’introduction du dépistage prénatal des anomalies 
fœtales à l’échographie à mi-trimestre permet la détection précoce de nombreuses 
anomalies dont les plus importantes. Une fois le diagnostic posé, les parents 
ont le choix d’interrompre ou de poursuivre la grossesse après un conseil 
approprié. Le but de cette étude est de déterminer le modèle d’interruption de 
grossesse pour les anomalies congénitales majeures dans notre hôpital après sept 
ans de début du programme de dépistage.
MÉTHODES: Il s’agissait d’une étude rétrospective dans laquelle toutes les 
femmes qui se sont présentées pour un dépistage échographique prénatal 
d’anomalies fœtales à l’University College Hospital d’Ibadan, au Nigéria entre 
août 2012 et juillet 2019 ont été scannées. Celles dont l’échographie avait 
diagnostiqué des anomalies fœtales majeures ont été informées de la gravité des 
anomalies et ont eu la possibilité de poursuivre la grossesse ou de 
l’interrompre. Toutes les données ont été enregistrées dans un tableur tandis 
que l’analyse statistique a été effectuée à l’aide du tableur IBM-SPSS version 
20.
RÉSULTATS: Au cours de la période de sept ans, trois mille cent vingt (3 120) 
fœtus ont été dépistés pour des anomalies fœtales, dont soixante et un (1,95 %) 
avaient des anomalies majeures. Vingt (32,8%) des anomalies majeures ont été 
interrompues à divers stades de la grossesse. Les anomalies du système nerveux 
central et du système musculo-squelettique étaient les anomalies les plus 
fréquemment terminées, chacune ayant 8 fœtus. Cela a été suivi par des anomalies 
impliquant plus d’un système qui ont été diagnostiquées chez 3 des fœtus. Toutes 
les mères ont été conseillées avant l’interruption des grossesses. Dix-neuf 
(95%) des anomalies ont été confirmées après l’arrêt.
CONCLUSION: La disponibilité du dépistage échographique prénatal permet un 
diagnostic précis d’une gamme d’anomalies fœtales, y compris celles 
incompatibles avec la vie. Par conséquent, l’interruption de grossesse avec des 
anomalies majeures contribue de manière significative à la diminution globale de 
la morbidité et de la mortalité périnatales associées aux malformations 
congénitales.
MOTS-CLÉS: Interruption, Grossesse, Anomalies majeures, fœtales, Échographie.

The risk for adverse consequences and disease due to the trauma of child abuse 
or neglect is easily assessed using the self-administered modified ACEs 
questionnaire. Exposure to child maltreatment is endemic and common. At least 
one out of every ten USA adults has a significant history of childhood 
maltreatment. This is a review of the literature documenting that a past history 
of childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) makes substantial contributions to physical 
disease in adults, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung 
cancer, hypertension, stroke, kidney disease, hepatitis, obesity, diabetes, 
coronary artery disease, pelvic pain, endometriosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, 
irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and auto immune diseases. Adults who 
have experienced child maltreatment have a shortened life expectancy. The 
contribution of CAN trauma to these many pathologies remains largely 
underappreciated and neglected compared to the attention given to the array of 
mental illnesses associated with child maltreatment. Specific pathophysiolologic 
pathways have yet to be defined. Clinical recognition of the impact of past CAN 
trauma will contribute to the healing process in any disease but identifying 
specific effective therapies based on this insight remains to be accomplished. 
Recommendations are made for managing these patients in the clinic. It is 
important to incorporate screening for CAN throughout adult medical practice 
now.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease 
recognized as the most common form of dementia among elderly people. Due to the 
fact that the exact pathogenesis of AD still remains to be fully elucidated, the 
treatment is only symptomatic and available drugs are not able to modify AD 
progression. Considering the increase in life expectancy worldwide, AD rates are 
predicted to increase enormously, and thus the search for new AD drugs is 
urgently needed. Due to their complex nitrogen-containing structures, alkaloids 
are considered to be promising candidates for use in the treatment of AD. Since 
the introduction of galanthamine as an antidementia drug in 2001, Amaryllidaceae 
alkaloids (AAs) and further isoquinoline alkaloids (IAs) have been one of the 
most studied groups of alkaloids. In the last few years, several compounds of 
new structure types have been isolated and evaluated for their biological 
activity connected with AD. The present review aims to comprehensively summarize 
recent progress on AAs and IAs since 2010 up to June 2021 as potential drugs for 
the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: This study sought to investigate the prevalence and clinical outcome 
of left ventricular (LV) geometry in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) and the impact of glucose metabolism on the incidence of left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH).
METHODS: 15,010 subjects (35-74 years) of the population-based Gutenberg Health 
Study were categorized into euglycemia, prediabetes, and T2DM according to 
clinical and metabolic (HbA1c) information. Clinical outcome was assessed via 
structured follow-up.
RESULTS: The study comprised 12,121 individuals with euglycemia (81.6%), 1415 
with prediabetes (9.5%), and 1316 with T2DM (8.9%). Prevalence of LVH increased 
from euglycemia (10.2%) over prediabetes (17.8%) to T2DM (23.8%). Prediabetes 
and T2DM were associated with increased LV mass index (prediabetes: β1.3 (95% CI 
0.78-1.81), p < 0.0001; T2DM: β2.37 (95% CI 1.81; 2.92), p < 0.0001) independent 
of age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). The frequency of LVH was 
related to the presence of T2DM (prevalence ratio (PR)T2DM 1.2 (95% CI 
1.06-1.35), p = 0.0038). T2DM was related to mortality independent of age, sex, 
and CVRF regardless of LVH (hazard ratio (HR)T2DM-LVH 2.67 (95% CI 1.94-3.66), p 
< 0.0001; HRT2DM-noLVH 1.59 (95% CI 1.29-1.96), p < 0.0001), prediabetes was 
only associated with outcome in individuals with LVH independent of age and sex 
(HRprediabetes-LVH 1.51 (95% CI 1.01-2.25), p = 0.045). Neither T2DM nor 
prediabetes were predictors of incident LVH after adjustment for clinical 
covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes and T2DM promote alterations of cardiac geometry. T2DM 
and particularly the coprevalence of T2DM with LVH substantially reduce life 
expectancy. These findings highlight the need for new therapeutic and screening 
approaches to prevent and detect cardiometabolic diseases at an early stage.

Skeletal muscle fibrosis occurs with aging and has been suggested to impair 
muscle performance, thereby decreasing quality of life. Recently, muscle 
stiffness, a surrogate measure of muscle fibrosis, was noninvasively quantified 
as the shear modulus using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) in humans. 
We aimed to investigate thigh muscle stiffness in females and males, 
respectively, across a broad range of ages by using SWE. Eighty-six 
community-dwelling Japanese people who were aged 30 to 79 years and did not 
regularly exercise participated in this study. The vastus lateralis (VL) shear 
modulus was measured at three different knee joint angles: full extension, 90° 
of flexion, and full flexion. There were no significant main effects of sex or 
age on the VL shear modulus in full extension or 90° of flexion of the knee. 
However, the VL shear modulus in knee full flexion was significantly smaller in 
females than in males and increased with age from 47.9 years. The results 
suggest that the accelerated increase in VL stiffness that occurs after an 
individual passes their late 40s may be an important therapeutic target for 
developing effective treatments and programs that preserve and improve quality 
of life.

Promoting successful aging strategies through well-reasoned caregiving programs 
is, and should be, one of the main objectives of many government policies and 
their implementing agencies. Well-being has been considered an important 
indicator of successful aging. Leisure is a key life domain and a core 
ingredient for overall well-being. Yet, within well-being research, few studies 
have made the connection between leisure participation as accepted behavior and 
subjective well-being in senior citizens. This study proposed to examine the 
applicability of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) 
in explaining senior citizens' decision-making processes in terms of leisure 
participation behavior and the effect of such behavioral engagement on 
subjective well-being. The respondents were senior citizens in Taiwan who played 
gateball and were aged 60 years or older. A total of 595 usable responses were 
obtained and used to answer the research question. The empirical results 
indicate that performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating 
conditions are positively and significantly related to senior citizens' gateball 
participation behavior. In addition, gateball participation behavior had a 
positive and significant effect on respondents' subjective well-being. The 
results of this study not only extend the application of UTAUT in terms of 
participation behavior in leisure activities, but also can provide gateball 
associations and government entities a theoretical model for developing and 
promoting gateball programs which serve or involve the elderly, as well as 
helping older adults to pursue satisfactory levels of wellbeing.

Nurses are rarely treated as equals in the social, professional, clinical, and 
administrative life of healthcare organisations. The primary objective of this 
study is to explore nurses' perceptions of organisational justice in public 
healthcare institutions in Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, and to analyse the 
ways in which they exercise their political agency to challenge the 
institutional order when it fails to reflect their professional ethos. An 
ethnomethodological approach using critical discourse analysis will be employed. 
The main participants will be nurses occupying different roles in healthcare 
organisations, who will be considered central respondents, and physicians and 
managers, who will be considered peripheral respondents. Data generation 
techniques include semi-structured interviews, a sociodemographic questionnaire, 
and the researcher's field diary. This is one of the first studies to address 
organisational justice in healthcare organisations from a macrostructural 
perspective and to explore nurses' political agency. The results of this study 
have the potential to advance knowledge and to ensure that healthcare 
organisations are fairer for nurses, and, by extension, for the patients in 
their care.

Maintaining muscle mass and function is important throughout the lifestyle. 
While environmental factors such as physical activity and healthy nutrition are 
well investigated, the contribution of genetic factors is still controversial. 
Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of a common ACTN3 polymorphism 
(rs1815739) on body composition, handgrip strength, knee extensor peak torque, 
and physical performance (gait speed, 30-s arm curl, 30-s chair stand) in 
Kosovan adults. In total, 308 participants (160 females and 148 males, age range 
from 40 to 91 years) took part in this cross-sectional study. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from saliva and assessed for ACTN3 genotype distribution (41.5% of RR, 
53.9% of RX and 4.6% of XX). Genotype allocation did not account for differences 
in any of the variables. Interestingly, female XX carriers were taller (p = 
0.025) and had a higher isokinetic knee extension peak torque (p = 0.024) than 
the RX+RR group. In males, XX carriers were also taller (p = 0.049) and had a 
lower BMI (p = 0.026), but did not differ in any of the strength and performance 
parameters. These results indicate that the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism might exert 
a sex-specific impact on knee extensor peak torque and BMI.

The increase in life expectancy has led to the appearance of chronic diseases 
and interest in healthy aging, in turn promoting a growing interest in bioactive 
compounds (BCs) and functional ingredients. There are certain foods or products 
rich in functional ingredients, and algae are one of them. Algae consumption has 
been nominal in Europe until now. However, in recent years, it has grown 
significantly, partly due to globalization and the adoption of new food trends. 
With the aim of obtaining BCs from foods, multiple methods have been proposed, 
ranging from conventional ones, such as maceration or Soxhlet extraction, to 
more innovative methods, e.g., ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). UAE 
constitutes a novel method, belonging to so-called green chemistry, that enables 
the extraction of BCs requiring lower amounts of solvent and energy costs, 
preserving the integrity of such molecules. In recent years, this method has 
been often used for the extraction of different BCs from a wide range of algae, 
especially polysaccharides, such as carrageenans and alginate; pigments, 
including fucoxanthin, chlorophylls, or β-carotene; and phenolic compounds, 
among others. In this way, the application of UAE to marine algae is an 
efficient and sustainable strategy to pursue their deep characterization as a 
new source of BCs, especially suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets.

Aging and smoking are associated with the progressive development of three main 
pulmonary diseases: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial 
lung abnormalities (ILAs), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). All three 
manifest mainly after the age of 60 years, but with different natural histories 
and prevalence: COPD prevalence increases with age to >40%, ILA prevalence is 
8%, and IPF, a rare disease, is 0.0005-0.002%. While COPD and ILAs may be 
associated with gradual progression and mortality, the natural history of IPF 
remains obscure, with a worse prognosis and life expectancy of 2-5 years from 
diagnosis. Acute exacerbations are significant events in both COPD and IPF, with 
a much worse prognosis in IPF. This perspective discusses the paradox of the 
striking pathological and pathophysiologic responses on the background of the 
same main risk factors, aging and smoking, suggesting two distinct 
pathophysiologic processes for COPD and ILAs on one side and IPF on the other 
side. Pathologically, COPD is characterized by small airways fibrosis and 
remodeling, with the destruction of the lung parenchyma. By contrast, IPF almost 
exclusively affects the lung parenchyma and interstitium. ILAs are a 
heterogenous group of diseases, a minority of which present with the alveolar 
and interstitial abnormalities of interstitial lung disease.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as a loss of ovarian function 
before the age of 40 years, with a prevalence rate estimated at approximately 
1%. It causes infertility and is related to serious long-term health 
consequences, including reduced life expectancy, increased cardiovascular risk, 
decreased bone mineral density and neurological disorders. There is currently no 
effective therapy for POI that is widely available in clinical practice; 
therefore, the treatment of patients with POI is based on hormone replacement 
therapy. One of the recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology 
of POI has been the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) 
in the disease. Moreover, intensive research on human folliculogenesis and 
reproductive biology has led to the development of novel promising therapeutic 
strategies with the use of exosomal miRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells 
to restore ovarian function in POI patients. This narrative review focuses on 
the new studies concerning the role of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of POI, 
together with their potential as biomarkers of the disease and targets for 
therapy.

In the lifetime extension of nuclear power plants (NPPs) context, aging of 
electric cables has to be very well understood in order to predict their 
end-of-life and thus to replace them on time. Therefore, evaluation and 
understanding of the ageing mechanism of the cable insulating material is 
mandatory under conditions as close as possible of those encountered in NPPs. In 
this context, different formulated crosslinked polyethylenes (XLPE)-one of the 
polymers used nowadays to manufacture the insulator layer-have been irradiated 
under oxidative conditions, at two different dose rates and at different aging 
doses. Gases emitted and consumed from the irradiated polymers were quantified 
to identify the primary processes happening in the materials and thus the 
interactions involved between the different molecules composing the formulated 
polymers.

Despite widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and increased 
life expectancy in people living with HIV (PLWH), HIV-related lymphomas (HRL) 
remain a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality for PLWH, even in 
patients optimally treated with cART. While the incidence of aggressive forms of 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma decreased after the advent of cART, incidence of Hodgkin 
lymphoma (HL) has increased among PLWH in recent decades. The coinfection of 
Epstein-Barr virus plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HL in the HIV 
setting. Currently, PLWH with HRL, including HL, are treated similarly to 
HIV-negative patients and, importantly, the prognosis of HL in PLWH is 
approaching that of the general population. In this regard, effective cART 
during chemotherapy is strongly recommended since it has been shown to improve 
survival rates in all lymphoma subtypes, including HL. As a consequence, 
interdisciplinary collaboration between HIV specialists and hemato-oncologists 
for the management of potential drug-drug interactions and overlapping 
toxicities between antiretroviral and antineoplastic drugs is crucial for the 
optimal treatment of PLWH with HL. In this article the authors review and update 
the epidemiological, clinical and biological aspects of HL presenting in PLWH 
with special emphasis on advances in prognosis and the factors that have 
contributed to it.

Most human movements require coordinated activation of multiple muscles. 
Although many studies reported associations between arm, leg, and trunk muscles 
during functional tasks, their neural interaction mechanisms still remain 
unclear. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate arm-trunk or arm-leg 
neural interactions in the corticospinal tract during different arm muscle 
contractions. Specifically, we examined corticospinal excitability of the 
erector spinae (ES; trunk extensor), rectus abdominis (RA; trunk flexor), and 
tibialis anterior (TA; leg) muscles while participants exerted: (1) wrist 
flexion and (2) wrist extension isometric contraction at various contraction 
intensity levels ranging from rest to 50% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) 
effort. Corticospinal excitability was assessed using motor evoked potentials 
(MEPs) elicited through motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 
Results showed that ES MEPs were facilitated even at low contractions (>5% MVC) 
during wrist flexion and extension, while stronger contractions (>25% MVC) were 
required to facilitate RA MEPs. The extent of facilitation of ES MEPs depended 
on contraction intensity of wrist extension, but not flexion. Moreover, TA MEPs 
were facilitated at low contractions (>5% MVC) during wrist flexion and 
extension, but contraction intensity dependence was only shown during stronger 
wrist extension contractions (>25% MVC). In conclusion, trunk extensor 
corticospinal excitability seems to depend on the task and the intensity of arm 
contraction, while this is not true for trunk flexor and leg muscles. Our study 
therefore demonstrated task- and intensity-dependent neural interactions of 
arm-trunk connections, which may underlie anatomic and/or functional substrates 
of these muscle pairs.

The northern corn rootworm, Diabrotica barberi Smith & Lawrence, has a 
univoltine life cycle that typically produces one generation a year. When 
rearing the northern corn rootworm in the laboratory, in order to break 
diapause, it is necessary to expose eggs to a five month cold period before 
raising the temperature. By selective breeding of the small fraction of eggs 
that hatched without cold within 19-32 days post oviposition, we were able to 
develop a non-diapausing colony of the northern corn rootworm within five 
generations of selection. Through selection, the percentages of adult emergence 
from egg hatch without exposure to cold treatment significantly increased from 
0.52% ± 0.07 at generation zero to 29.0% ± 2.47 at generation eight. During this 
process, we developed an improved method for laboratory rearing of both the 
newly developed non-diapausing strain as well as the diapausing strain. The 
development of the non-diapausing colony along with the improvements to the 
rearing system will allow researchers to produce up to six generations of the 
northern corn rootworm per year, which would facilitate research and advance our 
knowledge of this pest at an accelerated rate.
