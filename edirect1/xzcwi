OBJECTIVE: To compare the recommended three-view fetal heart screening method to 
detect major congenital heart disease (CHD) with more elaborate screening 
strategies to determine the cost-effective strategy in unselected (low-risk) 
pregnancies.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was designed to compare four screening 
strategies to identify fetuses with major CHD in a theoretical cohort of 4 000 
000 births in the USA. The four strategies were: (1) three views: four-chamber 
view (4CV) and views of the left (LVOT) and right (RVOT) ventricular outflow 
tracts; (2) five views: 4CV, LVOT, RVOT and longitudinal views of the ductal 
arch and aortic arch; (3) five axial views: 4CV, LVOT, RVOT, three-vessel (3V) 
view and three-vessels-and-trachea view; and (4) six views: 4CV, LVOT, RVOT and 
3V views and longitudinal views of the ductal arch and aortic arch. Outcomes 
related to neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental disability were evaluated. 
The analysis was performed from a healthcare-system perspective, with a 
cost-effectiveness willingness-to-pay threshold set at $100 000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Baseline analysis, one-way sensitivity 
analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation were performed.
RESULTS: In our baseline model, screening with five axial views was the optimal 
strategy, detecting 3520 more CHDs, and resulting in 259 fewer children with 
neurodevelopmental disability, 40 fewer neonatal deaths and only slightly higher 
costs, compared with screening with the currently recommended three views. 
Screening with six views was more effective, but also cost considerably more, 
compared with screening with five axial views, and had an incremental cost of 
$490 023/QALY, which was over the willingness-to-pay threshold. The five-view 
strategy was dominated by the other three strategies, i.e. it was more costly 
and less effective in comparison. The data were robust when tested with 
Monte-Carlo and one-way sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: Although current guidelines recommend a minimum of three views for 
detecting CHD during the mid-trimester anatomy scan, screening with five axial 
views is a cost-effective strategy that may lead to improved outcome compared 
with three-view screening. Copyright © 2020 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley &

BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab (Pembro) in combination with chemotherapy has been 
approved for the treatment of pretreated advanced NSCLC in the United States and 
China for its significant efficacy. However, the cost-effectiveness is unknown 
considering Pembro's high price. The impact of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
test on the cost-effectiveness is also unknown. The current study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for nonsquamous NSCLC from the United 
States and China public payers' perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature-based Markov model was conducted using 
KEYNOTE-189 trial data to compare cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
of three treatment strategies for nonsquamous NSCLC: Pembro-chemotherapy 
combination and chemotherapy strategy without PD-L1 test, and treatment strategy 
according to their PD-L1 status.
RESULTS: In base case analysis, the combination strategy generated an additional 
0.78 QALYs and 0.59 QALYs over chemotherapy in the United States and China 
respectively, resulting in an ICER of $132 392/QALY in the United States and 
$92 533/QALY in China. In the PD-L1 ≥1% base case, the ICERs were $77 754/QALY 
and $56 768/QALY respectively in the United States and China for PD-L1 test 
strategy. In the PD-L1 ≥50% base case, the ICERs were $44 731/QALY and 
$34 388/QALY respectively in the United States and China for PD-L1 test 
strategy. Lowering Pembro price can also partly decrease the ICERs.
CONCLUSION: Compared with chemotherapy, the combination strategy is not 
cost-effective for the treatment of NSCLC in the American and Chinese health 
care system at WTP threshold of $100 000/QALY for the United States and 
$27 351/QALY for China. Using PD-L1 test for patient selection and price 
reduction could improve the cost-effective probabilities of immunotherapy for 
nonsquamous NSCLC.

Diabetic neuropathy, including autonomic cardiovascular neuropathy, is the most 
common chronic complication of diabetes. It causes serious health and social 
consequences, leading to a significant reduction of life expectancy in DM 
patients. Its development is initially asymptomatic and therefore often 
underestimated, and only the early detection of diabetic neuropathy gives a real 
chance to stop its progression and prevent irreversible damage to the nerves. 
The optimal glycemic control is the most important factor preventing the 
development of neuropathy, inhibiting its occurrence and progression. In the 
advanced stage, however, only symptomatic treatment remains. The article 
provides an overview of current knowledge about etiopathogenesis, therapy, 
symptoms and the latest clinical trials on NSN and DM.

Publisher: Neuropatia cukrzycowa, w tym autonomiczna neuropatia sercowo – 
naczyniowa, jest najczęstszym powikłaniem przewlekłym cukrzycy. Powoduje ona 
poważne konsekwencje zdrowotne i społeczne, prowadząc do istotnego skrócenia 
oczekiwanej długości życia u pacjentów z DM. Przez jej początkowo bezobjawowy 
rozwój jest często nierozpoznawana, a jedynie wczesne wykrycie neuropatii 
cukrzycowej daje realne szanse na zahamowanie jej postępu i zapobiegnięcie 
nieodwracalnemu uszkodzeniu nerwów. Najistotniejszym czynnikiem 
przeciwdziałającym rozwojowi neuropatii, hamującym jej występowanie oraz 
progresję, jest optymalizacja kontroli glikemii. W fazie zaawansowanej 
natomiast, pozostają jedynie próby leczenia objawowego. Poniższy artykuł

The EuroQol Group's health descriptive systems, the EQ-5D-3L and its successor 
introduced in 2009, the EQ-5D-5L, are widely used worldwide for valuing 
health-related quality of life for cost-utility analysis and patient-reported 
health outcome measures. A new online tool for creating personal and social 
EQ-5D-5L value sets was recently developed and trialled in New Zealand (NZ). The 
tool, which includes extensive checks of the quality of participants' data, 
implements the PAPRIKA method - a novel type of adaptive discrete choice 
experiment in the present context - and a binary search algorithm to identify 
any health states worse than dead. After development and testing, the tool was 
distributed in an online survey in February and March 2018 to a representative 
sample of NZ adults (N = 5112), whose personal value sets were created. The 
tool's extensive data quality checks resulted in a 'high-quality' sub-sample of 
2468 participants whose personal value sets were, in effect, averaged to create 
a social value set for NZ. These results overall as well as feedback from 
participants indicates that the new valuation tool is feasible and acceptable to 
participants, enabling valuation data to be relatively easily and cheaply 
collected. The tool could also be used in other countries, tested against other 
methods for creating EQ-5D-5L value sets, applied in personalised medicine and 
adapted to create value sets for other health descriptive systems.

Effects of Chlorogenic acid-Gelatin (CGA-Gel) combined with partial freezing on 
quality change of sword prawn (Parapenaeopsis hardwickii) stored at -5 °C were 
evaluated for 23 days. Changes in sensory score, total viable counts (TVC), and 
physiochemical indexes including pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and Ca2+-ATPase were examined. 
All shrimp treated with CGA and CGA-Gel had lower total viable counts compared 
to control (P < 0.05). The value of TVB-N and TBA of CGA-Gel treated group at 
day 13 were 18.4 mg N/100 g and 0.175 mg/100 g respectively, both below the 
proposed safe limits and values of CGA treated group. All the results 
demonstrated that Chlorogenic acid can inhibit growth of microorganism, lipid 
oxidation and protein degradation. CGA-Gel treated samples presented better 
quality preservation effects than CGA treated alone. Therefore, CGA-Gel combined 
with partial freezing is promising in sword prawn shelf life extension.

An Investigation of Computer-based Brain Training on the Cognitive and EEG 
Performance of Employees().

Miller SL, Chelian S, McBurnett W, Tsou W, Kruse AA.

Neurocognitive skills (e.g., processing speed, attention and memory) were 
hypothesized to be critical for workplace performance and by extension for the 
work-life balance of employees. Twenty-one employee volunteers underwent a 
neurocognitive training program - which consisted of an initial pre-test 
assessment, a six week "boost" or intervention period, and then a re-assessment 
to track the progress of each participant. A median split of the group created 
two training groups: a long-training group that averaged 30 hours of total 
training during the boost period; and a short-training group that averaged 7 
hours of training. On pre-training measures of neurocognitive performance, group 
differences in performance did not reach statistical significance. Following 
training participants experienced a positive impact from the program as measured 
in three ways: standardized higher behavioral metrics, improved cognitive state 
metrics using EEG and positive self-reported data. From a quantitative 
perspective, participants' cognitive efficiency increased by 12% for the 
high-training group and 5% for the low-training group (cognitive efficiency 
refers to a behavioral measure which combines accuracy and speed). 
Qualitatively, study participants reported improvements in their productivity 
and mental performance post-study.

Behaviour Profiles for Evidence-based Policies Against Obesity.

Sarafis I, Diou C, Delopoulos A.

Obesity is a preventable disease that affects the health of a significant 
population percentage, reduces the life expectancy and encumbers the health care 
systems. The obesity epidemic is not caused by isolated factors, but it is the 
result of multiple behavioural patterns and complex interactions with the living 
environment. Therefore, in-depth understanding of the population behaviour is 
essential in order to create successful policies against obesity prevalence. To 
this end, the BigO system facilitates the collection, processing and modelling 
of behavioural data at population level to provide evidence for effective policy 
and interventions design. In this paper, we introduce the behaviour profiles 
mechanism of BigO that produces comprehensive models for the behavioural 
patterns of individuals, while maintaining high levels of privacy protection. We 
give examples for the proposed mechanism from real world data and we discuss 
usages for supporting various types of evidence-based policy design.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the shape and 
attachment position of stretchable textile piezoresistive sensors coated with 
single-walled carbon nanotubes on their performance in measuring the joint 
movements of children. The requirements for fabric motion sensors suitable for 
children are also identified. The child subjects were instructed to wear 
integrated clothing with sensors of different shapes (rectangular and 
boat-shaped), attachment positions (at the knee and elbow joints or 4 cm below 
the joints). The change in voltage caused by the elongation and contraction of 
the fabric sensors was measured for the flexion-extension motions of the arms 
and legs at 60°/s (three measurements of 10 repetitions each for the 60° and 90° 
angles, for a total of 60 repetitions). Their reliability was verified by 
analyzing the agreement between the fabric motion sensors and attached 
acceleration sensors. The experimental results showed that the fabric motion 
sensor that can measure children's arm and leg motions most effectively is the 
rectangular-shaped sensor attached 4 cm below the joint. In this study, we 
developed a textile piezoresistive sensor suitable for measuring the joint 
motion of children, and analyzed the shape and attachment position of the sensor 
on clothing suitable for motion sensing. We showed that it is possible to sense 
joint motions of the human body by using flexible fabric sensors integrated into 
clothing.

Fire blight, which is caused by the bacteria Erwinia amylovora, remains one of 
the most important diseases limiting the productivity of apple and pear orchards 
in the United States. In commercial orchards, in-season fire blight management 
relies exclusively on the use of antibiotic treatments (such as streptomycin and 
oxytetracycline) and on bacterial biocontrol agents whose efficacy is limited. 
We hypothesize that the efficacy of the biocontrol agents can be greatly 
enhanced through targeted delivery to flowers, which serve as initial infection 
courts, using the Japanese orchard bee, Osmia cornifrons. Many factors, such as 
the synchrony of life cycle with plant phenology and specificity to pomaceous 
plants, suggest that O. cornifrons could be an excellent vector of the 
biocontrol products during bloom in pome tree fruits. However, deployment of 
this pollinator species to deliver biocontrol agents for fire blight control has 
not been attempted previously due to the lack of an efficient system to pack the 
bodies of the bees exiting nesting tubes with the biocontrol products. In this 
study, we design and test a dispenser system to facilitate the use of O. 
conifrons as a vector for commercially available biocontrol products for fire 
blight control. The effectiveness of O. conifrons to deliver biocontrol agents 
to flowers, and to effect secondary dissemination from treated to untreated 
flowers is also evaluated in greenhouse experiments. We found that the O. 
conifrons bees were able to use the nest dispenser designed for the delivery of 
biological control products, and are effective in vectoring and delivering the 
Bacillus subtilis-based biological control product (Serenade®) to apple 
blossoms. We also found that the O. cornifrons were effective in secondary 
inoculation of this biological control product to newly-opened flowers. These 
findings suggest the potential use of commercially available O. conifrons and 
other orchard bees in targeted delivery of biological control products for fire 
blight, and possibly other diseases, in different fruit crops.

Nobiletin (NOB), one of polymethoxyflavone existing in citrus fruits, has been 
reported to exhibit a multitude of biological properties, including 
anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-atherosclerosis, neuroprotection, and 
anti-tumor activity. However, little is known about the anti-aging effect of 
NOB. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of NOB on 
lifespan, stress resistance, and its associated gene expression. Using 
Caenorhabditis elegans, an in vivo nematode model, we found that NOB remarkably 
extended the lifespan; slowed aging-related functional declines; and increased 
the resistance against various stressors, including heat shock and ultraviolet 
radiation. Also, NOB reduced the effects of paraquat stressor on nematodes and 
scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, gene expression revealed 
that NOB upregulated the expression of sod-3, hsp-16.2, gst-4, skn-1, sek-1, and 
sir-2.1, which was suggested that anti-aging activity of NOB was mediated most 
likely by activation of the target genes of the transcription factors including 
dauer formation (DAF)-16, heat-shock transcription factor (HSF)-1, and skinhead 
(SKN)-1. In summary, NOB has potential application in extension of lifespan, and 
its associated healthspan and stress resistances.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the public colorectal cancer 
screening program in the Abruzzo region, Italy.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was analysed using a two-armed Markov model 
comparing: (1) Abruzzo screening program based on biennial faecal immunochemical 
occult blood testing, with colonoscopy as second level test for individuals with 
positive results, with (2) Treatment of symptomatic patients according to the 
stage of the neoplasm. Transition probabilities were adjusted for accuracy of 
tests and incidence of colorectal cancer. Diagnosis-related groups' charges and 
field collected data were used to estimate costs. Costs and benefits were 
discounted by 3.5%. Monte Carlo simulation confirmed the robustness of the model 
results.
RESULTS: Assuming a compliance rate of 64.7%, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for the current colorectal screening program was €433.06/quality adjusted 
life year gained, considerably lower than conventional thresholds (around 
€30,000).
CONCLUSION: Early detection and intervention programs help to avoid a large 
number of highly debilitating and expensive cancer treatments. These results 
show that the screening program currently implemented in Abruzzo should be 
considered as a good investment in health.

Atrial dysfunction has been widely considered a marker or consequence of other 
cardiac conditions rather than the cause itself. Here, we propose the term 
atrial failure as a clinically relevant entity, defined as any atrial 
dysfunction causing impaired heart performance, symptoms, and worsening quality 
of life or life expectancy. Aspects of the etiology, mechanisms, and 
consequences of atrial failure are discussed. Recent advances in cardiac 
electrophysiology and imaging have improved our understanding of the highly 
complex atrial anatomy and function, underlying the paramount importance of the 
atria in optimal heart performance. It is time to reappraise the concept of the 
failing atrium as a primary cause or aggravating factor of the symptoms in many 
of our patients. The concept of atrial failure may foster basic and 
translational research to gain a better understanding of how to identify and 
manage atrial dysfunction.

OBJECTIVES: Clinical studies show that resistance exercise and a protein-rich 
diet can counteract the age-related decline of muscle mass, strength, and 
physical performance. The aim of the ProMuscle in Practice study was to test 
effectiveness of a resistance exercise and dietary protein intervention for 
older adults implemented in a real-life setting.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled multicenter intervention study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-eight community-dwelling older 
adults were included (age 75 ± 6 years). A 12-week intensive support 
intervention including progressive resistance exercise supervised by a 
physiotherapist and dietitian guidance on increasing protein intake was followed 
by a voluntary 12-week moderate support intervention to continue the adapted 
lifestyle pattern. The control group received no intervention.
METHODS: Compliance was measured through attendance lists and 3-day food 
records. Physical functioning, leg strength (3-repetition maximum, knee 
extension strength), lean body mass [(LBM) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry], 
and quality of life (5-level EQ-5D) were measured at baseline, and after 12 and 
24 weeks. Differences in change between groups were assessed with linear mixed 
model analysis.
RESULTS: The intervention group increased protein intake and attended 83.6% of 
the training sessions. Short Physical Performance Battery score slightly 
increased in intervention participants [from 10.1 (95% confidence interval 
9.7-10.5) to 10.4 (10.0-10.8) at week 12 and 10.6 (10.2-10.9) at week 24], where 
control participants decreased (time × treatment interactions, P < .05). 
Improvements in intervention group compared with controls were also observed for 
Timed Up-and-Go, strength and LBM at both time points (time × treatment 
interactions, P < .05). No difference between groups was found for the 6-Minute 
Walking Test, activities of daily living, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: ProMuscle in Practice was effective on improving 
muscle strength and LBM, with small changes in the composite function score in 
community-dwelling older adults in a real-life setting. Further research should 
explore feasibility of real-life implementation, as well as improving long-term 
compliance.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the 24-month cost-effectiveness of total knee replacement 
(TKR) plus non-surgical treatment compared with non-surgical treatment with the 
option of later TKR if needed.
METHODS: 100 adults with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis found eligible 
for TKR by an orthopaedic surgeon in secondary care were randomised to TKR plus 
12 weeks of supervised non-surgical treatment (exercise, education, diet, 
insoles and pain medication) or to supervised non-surgical treatment alone. 
Including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) data from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 
24 months, effectiveness was measured as change at 24 months. Healthcare costs 
and transfer payments were derived from national registries. Incremental 
healthcare costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
calculated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted and the 
probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at the 22 665 Euros/QALY 
threshold defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
RESULTS: TKR plus non-surgical treatment was more expensive (mean of 23 076 vs 
14 514 Euros) but also more effective than non-surgical treatment (mean 24-month 
improvement in QALY of 0.195 vs 0.056). While cost-effective in the unadjusted 
scenario (ICER of 18 497 Euros/QALY), TKR plus non-surgical treatment was not 
cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR 
if needed in the adjusted (age, sex and baseline values), base-case scenario 
(ICER of 32 611 Euros/QALY) with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 23.2%. 
Including deaths, TKR plus non-surgical treatment was still not cost-effective 
(ICERs of 46 277 to 64 208 Euros/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: From a 24-month perspective, TKR plus non-surgical treatment does 
not appear to be cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the 
option of later TKR if needed in patients with moderate-to-severe knee 
osteoarthritis and moderate intensity pain in secondary care in Denmark. Results 
were sensitive to changes, highlighting the need for further confirmatory 
research also assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of TKR.

INTRODUCTION: Early breast cancer detection and advancements in treatment 
options have resulted in an increase of breast cancer survivors. An increasing 
number of women are living with the long-term effects of breast cancer 
treatment, making the quality of survivorship an increasingly important goal. 
Breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is one of the most underestimated 
complications of breast cancer treatment with a reported incidence of 20%. A 
microsurgical technique called lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) might be a 
promising treatment modality for patients with BCRL. The main objective is to 
assess whether LVA is more effective than the current standard therapy 
(conservative treatment) in terms of improvement in quality of life and weather 
it is cost-effective.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, randomised controlled trial, carried out in 
two academic and two community hospitals in the Netherlands. The study 
population includes 120 women over the age of 18 who have undergone treatment 
for breast cancer including axillary treatment (sentinel lymph node biopsy or 
axillary lymph node dissection) and/or axillary radiotherapy, presenting with an 
early stage lymphoedema of the arm, viable lymphatic vessels and received at 
least 3 months conservative treatment. Sixty participants will undergo the LVA 
operation and the other sixty will continue their regular conservative 
treatment, both with a follow-up of 24 months. The primary outcome is the 
health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes are societal costs, quality 
adjusted life years, cost-effectiveness ratio, discontinuation rate of 
conservative treatment and excess limb volume.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Maastricht University Medical Center (METC) on 19 December 2018 
(NL67059.068.18). The results of this study will be disseminated in 
presentations at academic conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals 
and other news media.

Autophagy is an important cellular degradation pathway with a central role in 
metabolism as well as basic quality control, two processes inextricably linked 
to ageing. A decrease in autophagy is associated with increasing age, yet it is 
unknown if this is causal in the ageing process, and whether autophagy 
restoration can counteract these ageing effects. Here we demonstrate that 
systemic autophagy inhibition induces the premature acquisition of 
age-associated phenotypes and pathologies in mammals. Remarkably, autophagy 
restoration provides a near complete recovery of morbidity and a significant 
extension of lifespan; however, at the molecular level this rescue appears 
incomplete. Importantly autophagy-restored mice still succumb earlier due to an 
increase in spontaneous tumour formation. Thus, our data suggest that chronic 
autophagy inhibition confers an irreversible increase in cancer risk and 
uncovers a biphasic role of autophagy in cancer development being both tumour 
suppressive and oncogenic, sequentially.

AIM: This research presents the radiogenic components in thirteen limestone 
samples from a quarry site in Ewekoro, southwestern Nigeria.
METHODS: The distributions of natural radionuclides (238U, 232Th and 40K) in the 
limestone samples were determined by gamma spectroscopy using a well-type 
thallium-doped sodium iodide detector. Also, estimated associated radiological 
hazards are presented and compared with the standard threshold values.
RESULTS: The activity concentrations for 238U, 232Th and 40K radionuclides range 
18.09 ± 3.43-239.50 ± 25.74 Bqkg-1, 8.33 ± 0.83 - 360.01 ± 21.33 Bqkg-1 and 
11.28 ± 0.81-735.26 ± 0.95 Bqkg-1 respectively. The radium equivalent activity 
concentration in the samples ranges 58.857-758.832 Bqkg-1 with samples S3, S4 
and S11 values higher than the threshold limit of 370 Bqkg-1. Estimated dose 
rate and annual effective dose rate (AEDE) from the samples have ranges 
28.754-330.917 nGyh-1 and 35.26-405.84 μSvy-1 respectively greater than the 
standard limit of 59 nGyh-1 and 70 μSvy-1 respectively for all samples except 
S9. The estimated external and internal indices are ranging 0.16 - 2.05 and 0.21 
- 2.68 respectively, greater than permissible unity in some limestone samples 
such as S3, S4, S8, S11 and S13. Excess lifetime cancer risk was also computed 
using a life expectancy of 54.5 years. The results of higher radiological 
parameters in the limestone samples revealed that the miners have a high 
probability of contracting induced cancer.
CONCLUSION: A regular check-up is recommended for the miners and staffs within 
the quarry site. Also, the residents within the environs should be relocated far 
away from the quarry site, as the particulates from the limestone rock blasting 
could contaminate the air in the study area.

Mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSCs) exist in adult tissues, such as adipose 
tissue and bone marrow, and differentiate into cells of multiple lineages. In 
previous studies, we found that MSCs differentiate into steroidogenic cells by 
forced expression of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1)/adrenal 4 binding protein 
(Ad4BP), the master regulator of steroidogenesis and differentiation of 
pituitary gonadotrophs, adrenal glands, and gonads. In this study, 
SF-1/Ad4BP-induced steroidogenic cells derived from mouse adipose tissue-derived 
MSCs (ADSCs) were implanted under the kidney capsule of bilateral 
adrenalectomized (bAdx) mice. bAdx mice did not survive after 7 days. However, 4 
of 9 bAdx mice implanted with SF-1/Ad4BP-induced steroidogenic cells, 1 of 10 
bAdx mice transplanted with control ADSCs, and bAdx mice transplanted with an 
adrenal gland survived for 30 days. Plasma corticosterone levels in bAdx mice 
implanted with SF-1/Ad4BP-induced steroidogenic cells and control ADSCs were 
5.41 ± 2.26 ng/mL (mean ± SEM) and undetectable at 7 days after implantation, 
respectively. After removal of the kidney bearing the graft from the surviving 
mice at 30 days after implantation, plasma corticosterone was not detected in 
any of the samples. Immunohistochemical staining revealed SF-1/Ad4BP-positive 
cells under the capsule of the kidney. Although we performed an 
adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) loading test on bAdx mice implanted with 
SF-1/Ad4BP-induced steroidogenic cells, ACTH responsiveness was not observed. 
Implantation of steroidogenic cells derived from ADSCs into bAdx mice increased 
the basal plasma corticosterone level and extended the survival of bAdx mice, 
suggesting the capability of restoring steroidogenic cells by cell 
transplantation therapy for adrenal insufficiency.

BACKGROUND: It is known that health impacts economic performance. This article 
aims to assess the current state of health inequality in the tropics, defined as 
the countries located between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, 
and estimate the impact of this inequality on gross domestic product (GDP).
METHODS: We constructed a series of concentration indices showing 
between-country inequalities in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), taken 
from the Global Burden of Disease Study. We then utilized a non-linear least 
squares model to estimate the influence of health on GDP and counterfactual 
analysis to assess the GDP for each country had there been no between-country 
inequality.
RESULTS: The poorest 25% of the tropical population had 68% of the all-cause 
DALYs burden in 2015; 82% of the communicable, maternal, neonatal and 
nutritional DALYs burden; 55% of the non-communicable disease DALYs burden and 
61% of the injury DALYs burden. An increase in the all-cause DALYs rate of 
1/1000 resulted in a 0.05% decrease in GDP. If there were no inequality between 
countries in all-cause DALY rates, most high-income countries would see a modest 
increase in GDP, with low- and middle-income countries estimated to see larger 
increases.
CONCLUSIONS: There are large and growing inequalities in health in the tropics 
and this has significant economic cost for lower-income countries.
