BACKGROUND: Cumulative damage from multiple relapses in neuromyelitis optica 
spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is associated with poor health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) and long-term disability in patients positive for anti-aquaporin 4 
antibodies (AQP4+). This study assessed the effect of an individual relapse on 
HRQoL and disability outcomes in AQP4+ NMOSD.
METHODS: Post hoc analyses of data pooled from the PREVENT study and its 
open-label extension, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in 
AQP4+ NMOSD, examined the effect of a single relapse on 3 disability and 4 HRQoL 
outcome measures. Assuming the effect of 1 relapse extends to multiple relapses, 
an extrapolation was done to assess the effect of 2 relapses on these outcomes.
RESULTS: In 27 patients (placebo: n = 20; eculizumab: n = 7) experiencing an 
independently adjudicated relapse, 1 relapse led to significantly worse 
disability (modified Rankin Scale and Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) 
and HRQoL (36-item Short-Form Health Survey mental and physical component 
summaries; European Quality of Life 5-Dimension questionnaire 3-Level visual 
analogue scale and utility index) scores. In 4 of 7 outcomes, clinically 
meaningful worsening was more likely for relapsing versus non-relapsing patients 
(n = 116). Extrapolating the effect of 2 relapses predicted that clinically 
meaningful worsening was more likely in 6 out of 7 outcomes, including EDSS, for 
patients experiencing multiple relapses versus patients experiencing no 
relapses.
CONCLUSION: Findings from these clinical trial data demonstrate that a single 
NMOSD relapse can worsen disability and HRQoL, underscoring the role of relapse 
prevention in improving long-term outcomes in patients with AQP4+ NMOSD.

As the most common malignancy, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is typically 
fatal. The survival of patients with oral cancer has not improved, and tumor 
recurrence remains high. During tumorigenesis, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene 
expression. Patients' life expectancy can be determined by prognostic survival 
biomarkers, which can focus therapy on specific targets. This study evaluated 
five miRNAs associated with OSCC for their prognostic impact. It was determined 
through microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction that there was a significant difference in the expression of 
miRNAs between OSCC patients and control patients in plasma. We used the 
unpaired t-tests and the Mann-Whitney test to conduct the statistical analysis. 
Based on the study's results, five miRNAs have been found to have significantly 
different expression levels in the plasma of patients with OSCC; in particular, 
miR-31 was found to have a significantly higher expression level in OSCC 
patients' plasma as compared with healthy controls. Aside from that, there was a 
significant reduction in the expression of miR-100, miR-199a, miR-203, and 
mir345 in the plasma of OSCC patients (P < 0.05). To better understand the 
importance of miRNAs in OSCC, various OSCC cases were analyzed. Detecting miRNAs 
in plasma may be a useful diagnostic tool for oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Therapeutic strategies for the treatment of congenital bleeding disorders. 
Congenital hemorrhagic diseases (CHDs) are a group of rare disorders caused by 
quantitative or qualitative deficiency of one or more coagulation factors. 
Haemophilia A, Haemophilia B, and von Willebrand disease are the most common 
congenital bleeding disorders. Over the past decades, the evolution of CHDs 
treatments has resulted in an increase in the average life expectancy of 
patients and in an improvement in their quality of life; it has also enabled the 
prevention of bleeding complications much more effectively than in the past. 
This has been possible, especially for haemophilia, mainly because of earlier 
diagnosis, introduction of recombinant factors, especially long-acting factors, 
and availability of new non-substitutive therapies. In 2021, there was an 
increase in the overall expenditure and consumption of coagulation factors in 
Italy; the increase concerned especially the long-acting recombinant factors 
used in the treatment of Haemophilia A and B and the monoclonal antibody 
emicizumab. Waiting for innovative therapies that can enable individually 
tailored therapies, special attention must be paid to prescriptive 
appropriateness and to identify the best diagnostic and therapeutic care 
pathways for patients.

Five heavy metals were introduced into the bacterial heavy metal resistance 
tests. The results showed that apparent inhibition effects of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on 
the growth of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans BYSW1 occurred at high 
concentrations (>0.04 mol l-1). Significant differences (P < 0.001) were both 
noticed in the expression of two ferredoxin-encoding genes (fd-I and fd-II) 
related to heavy metal resistance in the presence of Cd2+ and Cu2+ . When 
exposed to 0.06 mol l-1 Cd2+, the relative expression levels of fd-I and fd-II 
were about 11 and 13 times as much as those of the control, respectively. 
Similarly, exposure to 0.04 mol l-1 Cu2+ caused approximate 8 and 4 times higher 
than those of the control, respectively. These two genes were cloned and 
expressed in Escherichia coli, and the structures, functions of two 
corresponding target proteins, i.e. Ferredoxin-I (Fd-I) and Ferredoxin-II 
(Fd-II), were predicted. The recombinant cells inserted by fd-I or fd-II were 
more resistant to Cd2+ and Cu2+ compared with wild-type cells. This study was 
the first investigation regarding the contribution of fd-I and fd-II to 
enhancing heavy metal resistance of this bioleaching bacterium, and laid a 
foundation for further elucidation of heavy metal resistance mechanisms caused 
by Fd.

AIMS: Extreme temperatures are increasingly experienced as a result of climate 
change. Both high and low temperatures, impacted by climate change, have been 
linked with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Global estimates on non-optimal 
temperature-related CVD are not known. The authors investigated global trends of 
temperature-related CVD burden over the last three decades.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors utilized the 1990-2019 global burden of disease 
methodology to investigate non-optimal temperature, low temperature- and high 
temperature-related CVD deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
globally. Non-optimal temperatures were defined as above (high temperature) or 
below (low temperature) the location-specific theoretical minimum-risk exposure 
level or the temperature associated with the lowest mortality rates. Analyses 
were later stratified by sociodemographic index (SDI) and world regions. In 
2019, non-optimal temperature contributed to 1 194 196 (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI]: 963 816-1 425 090) CVD deaths and 21 799 370 (95% UI: 17 395 761-25 947 
499) DALYs. Low temperature contributed to 1 104 200 (95% UI: 897 783-1 326 965) 
CVD deaths and 19 768 986 (95% UI: 16 039 594-23 925 945) DALYs. High 
temperature contributed to 93 095 (95% UI: 10 827-158 386) CVD deaths and 2 098 
989 (95% UI: 146 158-3 625 564) DALYs. Between 1990 and 2019, CVD deaths related 
to non-optimal temperature increased by 45% (95% UI: 32-63%), low temperature by 
36% (95% UI: 25-48%), and high temperature by 600% (95% UI: -1879-2027%). 
Non-optimal temperature- and high temperature-related CVD deaths increased more 
in countries with low income than countries with high income.
CONCLUSION: Non-optimal temperatures are significantly associated with global 
CVD deaths and DALYs, underscoring the significant impact of temperature on 
public health.

Plain Language Summary: The paper discusses the relationship between non-optimal 
temperature and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and presents the first-to-date 
quantification of the global temperature-related CVD burden. Key findings 
include: Non-optimal temperatures were responsible for a significant proportion 
of global cardiovascular deaths between 1990 and 2019.People in lower 
socioeconomic regions were more vulnerable to the effects of non-optimal 
temperature on CVD than those in higher socioeconomic regions.

To Study Mean Corpuscular Volume in Alcoholic Liver Disease Patients and to 
Compare with Child-Pugh Score to Predict the Severity.

Mangal AK(1), Sharma D(1), Kumar P(1), Nagar GL(1).

Author information:

INTRODUCTION: Liver injury caused by the alcohol abuse is called alcoholic liver 
disease (ALD). In particular, ethanol exposure induces cell membrane remodeling 
in different cells and lipid vesicles including membrane fluidization. These 
phenomena may be related to the effects of alcohol on the red blood cells (RBCs) 
membrane because unmetabolized ethanol can have a direct effect on membrane 
properties.
MATERIALS: It was a cross sectional study conducted in 50 adult patients of both 
sex with a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease and equal number of controls 
matched in age and sex. Blood sample collected at the time of admission and sent 
for investigations and child-pugh score calculated.
RESULT: Maximum number of subjects were in 30 to 50 years of age group. Mean 
value of MCV in patients with alcoholic liver disease was 99.7fl (±8.176) and in 
control group was 84.2fl (±10.58) (P = 0.0001). Patients in child-pugh class A, 
B and C were 14%, 62% and 24% respectively. Moreover, there was statistically 
significant, positive correlation between MCV and child-pugh score. The raised 
MCV in alcoholic liver disease patients was associated with severity of ALD as 
mean MCV was 92.28 fl (±2.81) (P = 0.001) in child-pugh class A, 96.22fl (±8.20) 
(P = 0.001) in child-pugh class B and 113 fl (±11.25) (P = 0.005) in child-pugh 
class C.
CONCLUSION: Mean corpuscular volume is a simple, cost effective and easily 
obtainable test that may help in predicting the severity of disease and 
prognosis in terms of life expectancy as evidenced by its increased value in 
patients of chronic liver disease as well as its linear positive correlation 
with child-pugh score.

Speech-Language Pathology Treatment of Cognitive-Communication Deficits in 
School-Aged Children With Traumatic Brain Injury: A Scoping Review.

Crook L(1), Riccardi JS(1), Ruddock HS(1), Ciccia A(1).

Author information:
(1)Communication Sciences Program, Department of Psychological Sciences, Case 
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize the current 
evidence-based treatment practices used with school-aged children with any 
severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that could benefit the practice of 
speech-language pathologists (SLPs).
METHOD: A scoping review of the literature was conducted following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews guidelines. Included studies were assigned thematic labels based on a 
modified version of the Rehabilitation Treatment Specification System.
RESULTS: A total of 27 articles that covered 16 different treatment approaches 
met inclusion criteria for this study. Most studies included adolescent or 
teenage participants with moderate-severe TBIs. Treatment targets included 
executive functioning (n = 15), social competence (n = 6), postconcussive 
symptoms (n = 5), behavior (n = 3), family functioning (n = 1), and 
health-related quality of life (n = 1). The majority of current interventions 
for school-aged children with TBI include a multidisciplinary approach and 
components of family involvement education.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed on interventions that are specifically 
implemented by SLPs as well as protocols that include more heterogeneous samples 
(e.g., varied sociodemographic factors and injury severity) to allow for the 
development and testing of ecologically valid intervention practice. SLPs can 
use the results of this scoping review to individualize treatment based on the 
child's areas of need while considering individual characteristics and to 
provide person-centered intervention for children with school-aged TBI.

INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disease whose aetiology is unknown. It is characterised by 
upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Approximately 90% of cases of ALS are 
sporadic, whereas the other 10% are familial. Regardless of whether the case is 
familial o sporadic, patients will develop progressive weakness, muscle atrophy 
with spasticity, and muscle contractures. Life expectancy of these patients is 
generally 2 to 5 years after diagnosis.
DEVELOPMENT: In vivo models have helped to clarify the aetiology and 
pathogenesis of ALS, as well as the mechanisms of the disease. However, as these 
mechanisms are not yet fully understood, experimental models are essential to 
the continued study of the pathogenesis of ALS, as well as in the search for 
possible therapeutic targets. Although 90% of cases are sporadic, most of the 
models used to study ALS pathogenesis are based on genetic mutations associated 
with the familial form of the disease; the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS remains 
unknown. Therefore, it would be critical to establish models based on the 
sporadic form.
CONCLUSIONS: This article reviews the main genetic and sporadic experimental 
models used in the study of this disease, focusing on those that have been 
developed using rodents.

Designing Guidelines for Those Who Do Not Follow Them: The Impact of Adherence 
Assumptions on Optimal Screening Guidelines.

OBJECTIVES: Model-based cost-effectiveness analyses can inform decisions about 
screening guidelines by quantifying consequences of alternative algorithms. 
Although actual screening adherence is imperfect, incorporating nonadherence 
into analyses that aim to determine optimal screening may affect the policy 
recommendations. We evaluated the impact of nonadherence assumptions on the 
optimal cervical cancer screening in Norway.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model of cervical carcinogenesis to project 
the long-term health and economic outcomes under alternative screening 
algorithms and adherence patterns. We compared 18 algorithms involving primary 
human papillomavirus testing (5-yearly) that varied follow-up management of 
different human papillomavirus results. We considered 12 adherence scenarios: 
perfect adherence, 8 high- and low-coverage "random-complier" scenarios, and 3 
"systematic-complier" scenarios that reflect conditional screening behavior over 
a lifetime. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and considered a 
strategy with the highest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio < 55 000 US 
dollars/quality-adjusted life-year as "optimal."
RESULTS: Under perfect adherence, the least intensive screening strategy was 
optimal; in contrast, assuming any nonadherence resulted in a more intensive 
optimal strategy. Accounting for lower adherence resulted in both lower costs 
and health benefits, which allowed for a more intensive strategy to be 
considered optimal, but more harms for women who screen according to guidelines 
(ie, up to 41% more colposcopies when comparing the optimal strategy in the 
lowest-adherence scenario with the optimal strategy under perfect adherence).
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming nonadherence in analyses designed to inform national 
guidelines may lead to a relatively more intensive recommendation. Designing 
guidelines for those who do not adhere to them may lead to over-screening of 
those who do.

Developments in life expectancy and the growing emphasis on biological and 
'healthy' aging raise a number of important questions for health scientists and 
economists alike. Is it preferable to make lives healthier by compressing 
morbidity, or longer by extending life? What are the gains from targeting aging 
itself compared to efforts to eradicate specific diseases? Here we analyze 
existing data to evaluate the economic value of increases in life expectancy, 
improvements in health and treatments that target aging. We show that a 
compression of morbidity that improves health is more valuable than further 
increases in life expectancy, and that targeting aging offers potentially larger 
economic gains than eradicating individual diseases. We show that a slowdown in 
aging that increases life expectancy by 1 year is worth US$38 trillion, and by 
10 years, US$367 trillion. Ultimately, the more progress that is made in 
improving how we age, the greater the value of further improvements.

Improvements in life expectancy among high-income countries are increasingly 
occurring in later years. Efforts to exploit the malleability of age and the 
additional time longevity brings are already underway, but important roadblocks 
remain. This article discusses the socioeconomic concept of the longevity 
dividend, in which healthy and productive aging is achieved through a positive 
correlation between three dimensions: life expectancy, health and the economy. 
Investing in a longevity dividend is needed to offset the economic challenges of 
an aging society and embrace a new life course, but this requires deep-seated 
changes in individual behavior and corporate and government policies. Focusing 
on treatments that target delayed aging, supporting employment beyond 50 years 
of age and tackling ageism are key priorities.

UK state pension age is rising in response to life expectancy gains but 
population health and job opportunities may not be sufficient to achieve 
extended working lives1-3. This study aimed to estimate future trends in healthy 
working life expectancy (HWLE) from age 50 to 75 for men and women in England. 
Using the 'intercensal' health expectancy approach, annual period HWLE from 1996 
to 2014 was estimated using cross-sectional Health Survey for England data and 
mortality statistics4-7. HWLE projections until the year 2035 were estimated 
from Lee-Carter forecasts of transition rates8. Projections of life expectancy 
from age 50 showed gains averaging 10.7 weeks (0.21 years) and 6.4 weeks (0.12 
years) per calendar year between 2015 and 2035 for men and women respectively. 
HWLE has been extending in England but gains are projected to slow to an average 
of 1 week per year for men (0.02 years) and 2.8 weeks (0.05 years) per year for 
women between 2015 and 2035. Modest projected HWLE gains and the widening gap 
between HWLE and life expectancy from age 50 suggest that working lives are not 
extending in line with policy goals. Further research should identify factors 
that increase healthy working life.

In Ethiopia, children and adults face a double burden of malnutrition, with 
undernutrition and stunting coexisting with non-communicable diseases. Here we 
use a framework of comparative risk assessment, local dietary surveys and 
relative risks from large observational studies to quantify the health and 
environmental impacts of meeting adult and child recommended daily protein 
intakes in urban Addis Ababa. We find that plant-based foods, especially 
legumes, would have the lowest environmental impact and substantially increase 
life expectancy in adults, while animal-source proteins could be beneficial for 
children. This context-specific approach-accounting for regional constraints and 
trade-offs-could aid policymakers in developing culturally appropriate, 
nutritionally adequate and sustainable dietary recommendations.

Comorbid depression among diabetes mellitus (DM) patients is on the increase. 
This has been linked with poor glycaemic control, greater risk of complications, 
high burden of medical cost and health care utilisation, and worsening 
prevalence of other comorbidities resulting in decreased life expectancy. This 
study determined the antidepressant effect of amitriptyline on depression and 
glycaemic control among the depressed type 2 DM patients attending Federal 
Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti (FETHI), Nigeria. It was an interventional study 
involving 51 depressed type 2 DM patients randomly screened using Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). They had health education and oral amitriptyline 50mg 
at night for two months. Postintervention assessment was done using the same 
tool. Respondents' age ranged between 44 and 78 years with a mean age of 58±8.4 
years. Post-intervention assessment showed improved depressive symptoms; 50% of 
the respondents had significantly improved glycaemic control with a 
statistically significant effect on depression (the median score of PHQ-9 
reduced from 6.0 to 3.0).

chez les patients dépressifs atteints de diabète de type 2 qui fréquentent 
l’hôpital universitaire fédéral d’Ido-Ekiti (FETHI). Il s’agit d’une étude 
interventionnelle portant sur 51 patients atteints de diabète de type 2 et 
déprimés, sélectionnés au hasard à l’aide du questionnaire sur la santé des 
patients 9 (PHQ-9). Ils ont bénéficié d’une éducation à la santé et ont pris 50 
mg d’amitriptyline par voie orale pendant deux mois. L’évaluation 
post-intervention a été réalisée à l’aide du même outil. L’âge des personnes 
interrogées était compris entre 44 et 78 ans, avec un âge moyen de 58± 8,4 ans. 
L’évaluation postintervention a montré une amélioration des symptômes 
dépressifs, 50% des personnes interrogées ont eu un contrôle glycémique 
significativement amélioré avec un effet statistiquement significatif sur la 
dépression (le score médian du PHQ est passé de 6,0 à 3,0). Mots clés: Diabète

BACKGROUND: Childhood-onset chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition 
that can have a major effect on life expectancy and quality. We evaluated the 
usefulness of the kidney tubular cell stress marker urinary Dickkopf-related 
protein 3 (DKK3) in determining the short-term risk of chronic kidney disease 
progression in children and identifying those who will benefit from specific 
nephroprotective interventions.
METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we assessed the association between 
urinary DKK3 and the combined kidney endpoint (ie, the composite of 50% 
reduction of the estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] or progression to 
end-stage kidney disease) or the risk of kidney replacement therapy (ie, 
dialysis or transplantation), and the interaction of the combined kidney 
endpoint with intensified blood pressure reduction in the randomised controlled 
ESCAPE trial. Moreover, urinary DKK3 and eGFR were quantified in children aged 
3-18 years with chronic kidney disease and urine samples available enrolled in 
the prospective multicentre ESCAPE (NCT00221845; derivation cohort) and 4C 
(NCT01046448; validation cohort) studies at baseline and at 6-monthly follow-up 
visits. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, systolic blood 
pressure SD score (SDS), BMI SDS, albuminuria, and eGFR.
FINDINGS: 659 children were included in the analysis (231 from ESCAPE and 428 
from 4C), with 1173 half-year blocks in ESCAPE and 2762 in 4C. In both cohorts, 
urinary DKK3 above the median (ie, >1689 pg/mg creatinine) was associated with 
significantly greater 6-month eGFR decline than with urinary DKK3 at or below 
the median (-5·6% [95% CI -8·6 to -2·7] vs 1·0% [-1·9 to 3·9], p<0·0001, in 
ESCAPE; -6·2% [-7·3 to -5·0] vs -1·5% [-2·9 to -0·1], p<0·0001, in 4C), 
independently of diagnosis, eGFR, and albuminuria. In ESCAPE, the beneficial 
effect of intensified blood pressure control was limited to children with 
urinary DKK3 higher than 1689 pg/mg creatinine, in terms of the combined kidney 
endpoint (HR 0·27 [95% CI 0·14 to 0·55], p=0·0003, number needed to treat 4·0 
[95% CI 3·7 to 4·4] vs 250·0 [66·9 to ∞]) and the need for kidney replacement 
therapy (HR 0·33 [0·13 to 0·85], p=0·021, number needed to treat 6·7 [6·1 to 
7·2] vs 31·0 [27·4 to 35·9]). In 4C, inhibition of the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system resulted in significantly lower urinary 
DKK3 concentrations (least-squares mean 12 235 pg/mg creatinine [95% CI 10 036 
to 14 433] in patients not on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or 
angiotensin 2 receptor blockers vs 6861 pg/mg creatinine [5616 to 8106] in those 
taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor 
blockers, p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: Urinary DKK3 indicates short-term risk of declining kidney 
function in children with chronic kidney disease and might allow a personalised 
medicine approach by identifying those who benefit from pharmacological 
nephroprotection, such as intensified blood pressure lowering.

BACKGROUND: While modular reconstruction implants can be used to replace the 
bone lost after bone tumor resection, tumor excision from the neighboring soft 
tissues can lead to loss of strength and joint range of motion (ROM), which 
results in worse knee function. Functional recovery after total knee 
arthroplasty for osteoarthritis has been extensively documented. But few studies 
have evaluated the recovery after total knee reconstruction following tumor 
excision despite the fact that most of these patients are young and have high 
functional demands. We did a prospective cross-sectional study to: 1) compare 
muscle strength recovery around the knee with an isokinetic dynamometer after 
tumor excision and reconstruction with a modular implant to the healthy 
contralateral knee; 2) determine if the differences in peak torque (PT) in the 
knee extensors and flexors had a clinical impact.
HYPOTHESIS: Resection of soft tissues during tumor excision around the knee 
causes strength loss that cannot be fully recovered.
METHODS: The 36 patients who underwent extra- or intra-articular resection of a 
primary or secondary bone tumor in the knee area followed by reconstruction with 
a rotating hinge knee system between 2009 and 2021 were eligible for this study. 
The primary outcome was the ability to actively lock the operated knee. The 
secondary outcomes were the concentric PT during isokinetic testing at slow 
(90°/sec) and fast (180°/sec) speeds, flexion-extension ROM, Musculoskeletal 
Tumor Society (MSTS) score, the IKS, Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and KOOS.
RESULTS: Nine patients agreed to participate in the study, all of whom had 
regained the ability to lock their knee postoperatively. PT in flexion and 
extension on the operated knee was less than the healthy knee. The PT ratio for 
the operated/healthy knee at 60°/sec and 180°/sec in flexion was 56.3%±16.2 
[23.2-80.1] and 57.8%±12.3 [37.7-77.4], respectively, which corresponded to a 
slow-speed strength deficit of 43.7% in the knee flexors. The PT ratio for the 
operated/healthy knee at 60°/sec and 180°/sec in extension was 34.3%±24.6 
[8.6-76.5] and 43%±27.2 [13.1-93.4], respectively, which corresponded to a 
slow-speed strength deficit of 65.7% in the knee extensors. The mean MSTS was 
70%±20 [63-86]. The OKS was 29.9/48±11 [15-45], the mean IKS knee was 149.6±36 
[80-178] and the mean KOOS was 67.43±18.5 [35-88.7].
DISCUSSION: Despite all patients having the ability to lock out their knee, 
there was an imbalance in the strength between opposite muscle groups: 43.7% 
strength deficit at slow-speed and 42.2% at fast speed for the hamstring 
muscles, and 65.7% at slow-speed and 57% at fast speed for the quadriceps 
muscles. This difference is considered pathological with an increased risk of 
knee injury. Despite this strength deficit, this joint replacement technique, 
which is free of complications, can preserve good knee function with acceptable 
knee joint ROM and satisfactory quality of life.

Melatonin and Aging.

Irvine, CA, USA. scbondy@uci.edu.

The health problems associated with the aging process are becoming increasingly 
widespread due to the increase in mean life expectancy taking place globally. 
While decline of many organ functions is an unavoidable concomitant of 
senescence, these can be delayed or moderated by a range of factors. Among these 
are dietary changes and weight control, taking sufficient exercise, and the 
utilization of various micronutrients. The utility of incurring appropriate 
changes in lifestyle is generally not confined to a single organ system but has 
a broadly positive systemic effect.Among one of the most potent means of slowing 
down age-related changes is the use of melatonin, a widely distributed 
biological indole. While melatonin is well known as a treatment for insomnia, it 
has a wide range of beneficial qualities many of which are relevant. This 
overview describes how several of the properties of melatonin are especially 
relevant to many of the changes associated with senescence. Changes in 
functioning of the immune system are particularly marked in the aged, combining 
diminishing effectiveness with increasing ineffective and harmful activity. 
Melatonin treatment appears able to moderate and partially reverse this 
detrimental drift toward immune incompetence.

INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists represent highly 
efficacious treatment options for type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide was amongst the 
first authorised for use in 2010, but once-weekly semaglutide represents the 
most efficacious GLP-1 analogue currently available for type 2 diabetes. The aim 
of the present analysis was therefore to evaluate the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus liraglutide 1.8 mg 
with a lowered acquisition cost in the UK, as potentially lower cost liraglutide 
formulations may soon be developed.
METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patients' lifetimes using the IQVIA Core 
Diabetes Model (v9.0). Baseline cohort characteristics were sourced from SUSTAIN 
2, with changes in HbA1c, blood pressure and body mass index applied from a 
network meta-analysis, in which SUSTAIN 2 was used to inform the semaglutide 
arm. Modelled patients received semaglutide or liraglutide for 3 years, after 
which treatment was intensified to basal insulin. Costs were accounted from a 
healthcare payer perspective and expressed in 2021 pounds sterling (GBP). The 
acquisition cost of liraglutide was reduced by 33% compared with the currently 
marketed formulation.
RESULTS: Life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy were projected to 
improve with once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg, by 0.05 years and 0.06 
quality-adjusted life years, respectively, versus liraglutide 1.8 mg. Clinical 
benefits were due to a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications with 
semaglutide. Direct costs were estimated to be GBP 280 lower with semaglutide, 
entirely because of avoidance of diabetes-related complications versus 
liraglutide. Semaglutide 1 mg was therefore considered dominant versus 
liraglutide 1.8 mg, even with the liraglutide price reduced by 33%.
CONCLUSION: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg is likely to represent a dominant 
treatment option versus liraglutide 1.8 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
in the UK, even with the liraglutide price reduced by 33%.
