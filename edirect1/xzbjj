controlled trial comparing collaborative care with usual primary care for adults 
with depression (n = 581). Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated over a 12-month 
follow-up, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal 
Social Services (i.e. Third Party Payer). Sensitivity analyses are reported, and 
uncertainty is presented using the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) 
and the cost-effectiveness plane.
RESULTS: The collaborative care intervention had a mean cost of £272.50 per 
participant. Health and social care service use, excluding collaborative care, 
indicated a similar profile of resource use between collaborative care and usual 
care participants. Collaborative care offered a mean incremental gain of 0.02 
(95% CI: -0.02, 0.06) quality-adjusted life-years over 12 months, at a mean 
incremental cost of £270.72 (95% CI: -202.98, 886.04), and resulted in an 
estimated mean cost per QALY of £14,248. Where costs associated with informal 
care are considered in sensitivity analyses collaborative care is expected to be 
less costly and more effective, thereby dominating treatment as usual.
CONCLUSION: Collaborative care offers health gains at a relatively low cost, and 
is cost-effective compared with usual care against a decision-maker willingness 
to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. Results here support the 
commissioning of collaborative care in a UK primary care setting.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), tall cell (TC) variant, is exceptional in 
children. In adults it represents about 20% of PTCs, featuring a high-risk 
neoplasm, with a 4-fold risk of relapse and a 20-fold relapse-related risk of 
death. Out of 42 cases of pediatric PTCs, we found 3 cases of PTC-TC (7%) with 
clinical data at onset and follow-up up to June 2014. They were 3 females aged 
13, 15, and 15 years. Local extrathyroid extension was present in 2 cases. 
Neither nodal nor distant metastases were found. Two patients underwent 
hemithyroidectomy and 1 patient a total thyroidectomy, followed in all cases by 
life-long suppressive hormonal therapy. On follow-up, the patients were alive 
and well after 29, 24, and 29 years, respectively. The rarity of PTC-TC in 
children was confirmed. The behavior was indolent after a median follow-up of 
about 29 years, following treatment with hemithyroidectomy in 2 cases and 
controlled by suppressive hormonal therapy. The results of this series, albeit 
small, suggest that TC morphology in PTC does not carry the same negative 
prognostic significance in children as it does in adults. A conservative 
approach should therefore be considered for these 'pediatric type' cases of this 
tumor type.

Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance--Veterans' Group Life Insurance regulation 
update--ABO, VGLI application, SGLI 2-year disability extension. Final rule.

Department of Veterans Affairs.

This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) insurance 
regulations concerning Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) to reflect 
the statutory provisions of the Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010, which became law 
on October 13, 2010, and resulted in the need for amendments to change the SGLI 
Disability Extension period from 1 year to 2 years in duration; provide SGLI 
Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI) retroactive coverage effective from October 
7, 2001, for all qualifying injuries regardless of the geographic location and 
military operation in which the injuries were incurred; and remove the SGLI and 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) Accelerated Benefits Option (ABO) discount 
rate. This rule also clarifies that ``initial premium'' refers to ``initial 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance premium,'' updates the current address of the 
Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (OSGLI), managed by Prudential 
Insurance Company of America, to reflect where the ABO application is mailed for 
processing, and corrects the OSGLI phone number. Finally, this rule removes the 
ABO application form from the regulation, and it corrects and clarifies language 
concerning the VGLI application period that was inadvertently incorrectly 
modified in a prior amendment of the regulations.

[Symptom control and place of death in palliative cancer patients in primary 
care. Results of the controlled PAMINO evaluation study].

[Article in German]

BACKGROUND: The care of patients at the end of life focuses on preservation of 
the quality of life, symptom control and fulfillment of the preferred place of 
death. Only few care and outcome-related data for primary palliative care in 
Germany are available; therefore, the objective was to examine the quality of 
life, symptom control and place of death of patients with palliative treatment 
by general practitioners (GP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is part of the PAMINO project, a non-randomized, 
controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of continuing medical education 
for GPs (≥ 40 h) in palliative care (ISRCTN78021852). Cancer patients with an 
estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months were recruited by GPs with (PG) 
or without (CG) continuing education and documented the diagnosis, medication 
based on the hospice and palliative care collation ( Hospiz- und 
Palliativ-Erfassung, HOPE) core documentation and the preferred place of death. 
Patients rated their symptom burden and health-related quality of life using the 
quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C15-PAL). Baseline (t0) data at enrollment 
and the last individual (t1) assessment were used for the analysis.
RESULTS: Data of 68 patients (PG: n = 43, CG: n = 25, mean age 69.2 ± 12 years, 
average time since cancer diagnosis 14 months) were available at t0 and t1 (mean 
period 4.0 ± 2.1 months). Physical function decreased while emotional 
functioning remained stable. Patient-perceived pain did not increase; however, 
GPs intensified the pain therapy. The PGs prescribed non-opioid analgesics more 
frequently than CGs. During the observation period 59 patients died of which 40 
out of 48 (83 %) as preferred at home.
CONCLUSIONS: Stable emotional functioning, good symptom control in cancer 
patients at the end of life and the high rate of dying at home as preferred 
suggest that GPs with specific training can ensure high-quality general 
palliative care.

OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopy is recommended to detect radiographically occult 
metastases in patients with pancreatic cancer before curative resection. This 
study was conducted to test the hypothesis that diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) is 
cost-effective in patients undergoing curative resection with or without 
neoadjuvant therapy (NAT).
METHODS: Decision tree modelling compared routine DL with exploratory laparotomy 
(ExLap) at the time of curative resection in resectable cancer treated with 
surgery first, (SF) and borderline resectable cancer treated with NAT. Costs 
(US$) from the payer's perspective, quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Base case 
estimates and multi-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Willingness to pay 
(WtP) was US$4166/QALM (or US$50,000/quality-adjusted life year).
RESULTS: Base case costs were US$34,921 for ExLap and US$33,442 for DL in SF 
patients, and US$39,633 for ExLap and US$39,713 for DL in NAT patients. Routine 
DL is the dominant (preferred) strategy in both treatment types: it allows for 
cost reductions of US$10,695/QALM in SF and US$4158/QALM in NAT patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis supports the cost-effectiveness of routine DL 
before curative resection in pancreatic cancer patients treated with either SF 
or NAT.

BACKGROUND: Switzerland had the highest life expectancy at 82.8 years among the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2011. 
Geographical variation of life expectancy and its relation to the socioeconomic 
position of neighbourhoods are, however, not well understood.
METHODS: We analysed the Swiss National Cohort, which linked the 2000 census 
with mortality records 2000-2008 to estimate life expectancy across 
neighbourhoods. A neighbourhood index of socioeconomic position (SEP) based on 
the median rent, education and occupation of household heads and crowding was 
calculated for 1.3 million overlapping neighbourhoods of 50 households. We used 
skew-normal regression models, including the index and additionally marital 
status, education, nationality, religion and occupation to calculate crude and 
adjusted estimates of life expectancy at age 30 years.
RESULTS: Based on over 4.5 million individuals and over 400,000 deaths, 
estimates of life expectancy at age 30 in neighbourhoods ranged from 46.9 to 
54.2 years in men and from 53.5 to 57.2 years in women. The correlation between 
life expectancy and neighbourhood SEP was strong (r=0.95 in men and r=0.94 
women, both p values <0.0001). In a comparison of the lowest with the highest 
percentile of neighbourhood SEP, the crude difference in life expectancy from 
skew-normal regression was 4.5 years in men and 2.5 years in women. The 
corresponding adjusted differences were 2.8 and 1.9 years, respectively (all p 
values <0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although life expectancy is high in Switzerland, there is 
substantial geographical variation and life expectancy is strongly associated 
with the social standing of neighbourhoods.

BACKGROUND: Our study objectives were to evaluate the medical economics of 
cervical cancer prevention and thereby contribute to cancer care policy 
decisions in Japan.
METHODS: Model creation: we created presence- absence models for prevention by 
designating human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for primary prevention of 
cervical cancer. Cost classification and cost estimates: we divided the costs of 
cancer care into seven categories (prevention, mass-screening, curative 
treatment, palliative care, indirect, non-medical, and psychosocial cost) and 
estimated costs for each model. Cost-benefit analyses: we performed cost-benefit 
analyses for Japan as a whole.
RESULTS: HPV vaccination was estimated to cost $291.5 million, cervical cancer 
screening $76.0 million and curative treatment $12.0 million. The loss due to 
death was $251.0 million and the net benefit was -$128.5 million (negative).
CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer prevention was not found to be cost-effective in 
Japan. While few cost-benefit analyses have been reported in the field of cancer 
care, these would be essential for Japanese policy determination.

BACKGROUND: A significant number of people suffer iatrogenic bile duct injury 
during laparoscopic cholescystectomy. Biliary-digestive bypass may be 
complicated by stenosis and biliary sepsis, affecting both quality of life and 
life expectancy. To avoid bypass synthetic grafts have been used, which are 
expensive.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluating autologous implantation of peritoneus as alternative of 
bile duct repair.
METHODS: Under general anesthesia, ten New Zealand adult rabbits were operated, 
common bile duct approached and sectioned underneath the cystic duct followed by 
a liver biopsy. An autologous graft was built of peritoneum and graft-bile duct 
proximal and distal end-to-end anastomosis done. Animals were followed-up by 
weekly bilirrubin and transferases. Rabbits were scheduled euthanized and a 
liver biopsy done for histological examinations.
RESULTS: Autologous graft was easy to create and all rabbits survived. They did 
not develop jaundice or alterations in their normal habits. At necropsy, 
autologous grafts were removed and no signs of occlusion were noticed. Moderate 
short-term liver damage was observed but long-term damage was negligible. 
Bileoma and pyogenic liver abscess were observed in two animals, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Our results favourably match well-known procedures used for bile 
duct repair, especially in cases of severe injury (Bismuth-Strasberg E1-3): it 
seems less complicated than biliary-digestive bypass, not as expensive as 
synthetic grafts, and much easier to build than human amnion graft.
CONCLUSION: Interposing an autologous graft of peritoneum is an easy-to-create 
surgical procedure and circumferential bile duct injuries were adequately 
repaired.

Publisher: Antecedentes: un número significativo de individuos sufrirá daño por 
iatrogenia del colédoco durante colecistectomías laparoscópicas. Las 
derivaciones bilio-digestivas pueden complicarse con estenosis y sepsis biliar y 
afectar la calidad y expectativa de vida. Para evitar la derivación se utilizan 
injertos sintéticos. Objetivo: evaluar el implante autólogo de peritoneo en la 
reparación de colédoco. Material y métodos: estudio experimental efectuado en 10 
conejos Nueva Zelanda adultos a los que se les resecó un segmento del colédoco y 
para la reparación término-terminal de la vía biliar se construyó un 
neo-conducto con peritoneo parietal como auto-injerto. Se vigilaron con ontroles 
semanales de bilirrubinas y transaminasas. A la necropsia programada se estudió 
el segmento injertado, se realizó biopsia epática durante el procedimiento y la 
autopsia. Resultados: los animales no mostraron alteraciones en sus hábitos 
normales, la herida quirúrgica no tuvo complicaciones, no cursaron con ictericia 
y a la necropsia el segmento injertado se apreció totalmente integrado. En dos 
animales hubo como complicación un bilioma y un absceso hepático. El daño 
hepático observado inicialmente fue disminuyendo a lo largo del seguimiento. 
Discusión: nuestros resultados se equiparan con ventaja con los métodos 
conocidos de reparación de vías biliares, especialmente en lesiones severas 
(Bismuth-Strasberg E1-3). Adolece de las complicaciones de las derivaciones 
bilio-digestivas, no es caro como los injertos intéticos y es de mucho más fácil 
construcción que el injerto de amnios humano. Conclusiones: el auto-injerto de 
peritoneo es un procedimiento adecuado como alternativa para tratar lesiones 
circunferenciales de colédoco.

This paper describes an extension and performance characterization of a 
quantitative confirmatory multi-residue liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometric method for residues of macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics, 
originally validated for application to bovine kidney tissues, to tissues of 
salmon, shrimp and tilapia. The 12 analytes include clindamycin, erythromycin A, 
gamithromycin, josamycin, lincomycin, neospiramycin 1, oleandomycin, pirlimycin, 
spiramycin 1, tildipirosin, tilmicosin and tylosin A. The limit of detection was 
0.5 μg/kg. Within-laboratory precision evaluated over the analytical range of 
5.0-50.0 μg/kg ranged from 4 to 17%. The accuracy of the method ranged from 80 
to 112%. Recoveries ranged from 47 to 99% with all but one recovery above 60%. 
This is the first report of a quantitative confirmatory method for 
gamithromycin, pirlimycin and tildipirosin in fish and shrimp.

[Needle exchange programs are a cost-effective preventative measure against HIV 
in Iceland].

[Article in Icelandic]

Eythórsson ES, Ásgeirsdóttir TL, Gottfređsson M.

OBJECTIVE: In 2007 there was a sudden increase in HIV cases among intravenous 
drug users (IDUs) in Iceland. In 2007 - 2011 there were 34 new HIV cases among 
IDUs compared to four in the previous four year period. The purpose of this 
study was to assess whether needle exchange programs (NEPs) were cost-effective 
in preventing the spread of HIV among IDUs in Iceland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-utility analysis was conducted from a societal 
perspective. Costs are presented at the 2011 price level and values were 
discounted using a 3% discount rate. A ten year period, 2011 - 2020 was compared 
with and without NEPs. The Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) was calculated 
as societal cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analysis was 
performed on study assumptions.
RESULTS: The estimated societal costs associated with HIV infections among IDUs 
from 2011 - 2020 was 914.369.621 ISK without NEP and 947.653.758 ISK with NEP. 
Excess societal cost due to NEP was 33.284.137 ISK. Societal utility from NEP 
was 7,39 QALYs. Additionally, NEP prevented 4-5 HIV infections. The ICUR of 
providing NEP was 4.506.720 ISK.
CONCLUSION: According to WHO an intervention is considered cost-effective if the 
ICUR is less than three-fold national GDP per capita. In 2011 the GDP per capita 
in Iceland was 15.315.000 ISK. Sensitivity analysis on study assumptions yielded 
a societal cost within the WHO limit. Therefore, the results indicate that NEPs 
are cost-effective in preventing the spread of HIV among IDUs in Iceland.

if understanding is required for perception, how can we learn to perceive 
something new, something we do not yet understand? According to the sensorimotor 
approach, perception involves mastery of regular sensorimotor co-variations that 
depend on the agent and the environment, also known as the "laws" of 
sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs). In this sense, perception involves enacting 
relevant sensorimotor skills in each situation. It is important for this 
proposal that such skills can be learned and refined with experience and yet up 
to this date, the sensorimotor approach has had no explicit theory of perceptual 
learning. The situation is made more complex if we acknowledge the open-ended 
nature of human learning. In this paper we propose Piaget's theory of 
equilibration as a potential candidate to fulfill this role. This theory 
highlights the importance of intrinsic sensorimotor norms, in terms of the 
closure of sensorimotor schemes. It also explains how the equilibration of a 
sensorimotor organization faced with novelty or breakdowns proceeds by 
re-shaping pre-existing structures in coupling with dynamical regularities of 
the world. This way learning to perceive is guided by the equilibration of 
emerging forms of skillful coping with the world. We demonstrate the 
compatibility between Piaget's theory and the sensorimotor approach by providing 
a dynamical formalization of equilibration to give an explicit micro-genetic 
account of sensorimotor learning and, by extension, of how we learn to perceive. 
This allows us to draw important lessons in the form of general principles for 
open-ended sensorimotor learning, including the need for an intrinsic normative 
evaluation by the agent itself. We also explore implications of our 
micro-genetic account at the personal level.

Total caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition is a well-established 
experimental approach to extend life span in laboratory animals. Although CR in 
humans is capable of shifting several endocrinological parameters, it is not 
clear where the minimum inflection point of the U-shaped curve linking body mass 
index (BMI) with all-cause mortality lies. The exact trend of this curve, when 
used for planning preventive strategies for public health is of extreme 
importance. Normal BMI ranges from 18.5 to 24.9; many epidemiological studies 
show an inverse relationship between mortality and BMI inside the normal BMI 
range. Other studies show that the lowest mortality in the entire range of BMI 
is obtained in the overweight range (25-29.9). Reconciling the extension of life 
span in laboratory animals by experimental CR with the BMI-mortality curve of 
human epidemiology is not trivial. In fact, one interpretation is that the CR 
data are identifying a known: "excess fat is deleterious for health"; although a 
second interpretation may be that: "additional leanness from a normal body 
weight may add health and life span delaying the process of aging." This short 
review hope to start a discussion aimed at finding the widest consensus on which 
weight range should be considered the "healthiest" for our species, contributing 
in this way to the picture of what is the correct life style for a long and 
healthy life span.

FgfrL1 is the fifth member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (Fgfr) 
family. Studies with FgfrL1 deficient mice have demonstrated that the gene plays 
an important role during embryonic development. FgfrL1 knock-out mice die at 
birth as they have a malformed diaphragm and lack metanephric kidneys. Similar 
to the classical Fgfrs, the FgfrL1 protein contains an extracellular part 
composed of three Ig-like domains that interact with Fgf ligands and heparin. 
However, the intracellular part of FgfrL1 is not related to the classical 
receptors and does not possess any tyrosine kinase activity. Curiously enough, 
the amino acid sequence of this domain is barely conserved among different 
species, with the exception of three motifs, namely a dileucine peptide, a 
tandem tyrosine-based motif YXXΦ and a histidine-rich sequence. To investigate 
the function of the intracellular domain of FgfrL1, we have prepared genetically 
modified mice that lack the three conserved sequence motifs, but instead contain 
a GFP cassette (FgfrL1ΔC-GFP). To our surprise, homozygous FgfrL1ΔC-GFP knock-in 
mice are viable, fertile and phenotypically normal. They do not exhibit any 
alterations in the diaphragm or the kidney, except for a slight reduction in the 
number of glomeruli that does not appear to affect life expectancy. In addition, 
the pancreas of both FgfrL1ΔC-GFP knock-in and FgfrL1 knock-out mice do not show 
any disturbances in the production of insulin, in contrast to what has been 
suggested by recent studies. Thus, the conserved motifs of the intracellular 
FgfrL1 domain are dispensable for organogenesis and normal life. We conclude 
that the extracellular domain of the protein must conduct the vital functions of 
FgfrL1.

HIV-1 transgenic rats display alterations in immunophenotype and cellular 
responses associated with aging.

Advances in anti-retroviral therapy over the last two decades have allowed life 
expectancy in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus to 
approach that of the general population. The process of aging in mammalian 
species, including rats, results in immune response changes, alterations in 
immunological phenotypes, and ultimately increased susceptibility to many 
infectious diseases. In order to investigate the immunological pathologies 
associated with chronic HIV-1 disease, particularly in aging individuals, the 
HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1Tg) rat model was utilized. HIV-1Tg rats were challenged 
with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to determine immunological alterations during the 
aging process. LPS is known to cause an imbalance in cytokine and chemokine 
release, and provides a method to identify changes in immune responses to 
bacterial infection in an HIV animal model. An immune profile and accompanying 
cellular consequences as well as changes in inflammatory cytokine and chemokine 
release related to age and genotype were assessed in HIV-1Tg rats. The 
percentage of T cells decreased with age, particularly T cytotoxic cells, 
whereas T helper cells increased with age. Neutrophils and monocytes increased 
in HIV-1Tg rats during maturation compared to age-matched F344 control rats. 
Aging HIV-1Tg rats displayed a significant increase in the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, along with an increase in the chemokine, KC/GRO, in 
comparison to age-matched controls. Our data indicate that immunophenotype and 
immune responses can change during aging in HIV-positive individuals. This 
information could be important in determining the most beneficial age-dependent 
therapeutic treatment for HIV patients.

BACKGROUND: To facilitate the discussion on the increasing number of total hip 
replacements (THR) and their effectiveness, we apply a joint evaluation of 
hospital case costs and health outcomes at the patient level to enable 
comparative effectiveness research (CER) based on the preoperative health state.
METHODS: In 2012, 292 patients from a German orthopedic hospital participated in 
health state evaluation before and 6 months after THR, where health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) and disease specific pain and dysfunction were analyzed 
using EQ-5D and WOMAC scores. Costs were measured with a patient-based DRG 
costing scheme in a prospective observation of a cohort. Costs per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were calculated based on the preoperative 
WOMAC score, as preoperative health states were found to be the best predictors 
of QALY gains in multivariate linear regressions.
RESULTS: Mean inpatient costs of THR were 6,310 Euros for primary replacement 
and 7,730 Euros for inpatient lifetime costs including revisions. QALYs gained 
using the U.K. population preference-weighted index were 5.95. Lifetime costs 
per QALY were 1,300 Euros.
CONCLUSIONS: The WOMAC score and the EQ-5D score before operation were the most 
important predictors of QALY gains. The poorer the WOMAC score or the EQ-5D 
score before operation, the higher the patient benefit. Costs per QALY were far 
below common thresholds in all preoperative utility score groups and with all 
underlying calculation methodologies.

NICE's selective application of differential discounting: ambiguous, 
inconsistent, and unjustified.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recently 
recommended differential discounting of costs and health effects in the economic 
appraisal of health care interventions in certain circumstances. The 
recommendation was published in an amendment to NICE's Guide to the Methods of 
Technology Appraisal. The amendment states that differential discounting should 
be applied where "treatment effects are both substantial in restoring health and 
sustained over a very long period (normally at least 30 years)." Renewed 
interest in differential discounting from NICE is welcome; however, the 
recommendation's selective application of differential discounting raises a 
number of concerns. The stated criteria for applying differential discounting 
are ambiguous. The rationale for the selective application of differential 
discounting has not been articulated by NICE and is questionable. The selective 
application of differential discounting leads to several inconsistencies, the 
most concerning of which is the lower valuation of health gains for those with 
less than 30 years remaining life expectancy, which can be interpreted as age 
discrimination. Furthermore, the discount rates chosen by NICE do not appear to 
be informed by recent advances in the theoretical understanding of differential 
discounting. NICE's apparent motivation for recommending differential 
discounting was to ensure a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio for a pediatric 
oncology drug. While flexibility may be appropriate to allow some interventions 
that exceed conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds to be adopted, the 
selective adjustment of appraisal methods is problematic and without 
justification.

OBJECTIVES: Dietary salt intake has been causally linked to high blood pressure 
and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular disease causes 
approximately 35% of total UK deaths, at an estimated annual cost of £30 
billion. The World Health Organization and the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence have recommended a reduction in the intake of salt in people's 
diets. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of four population health 
policies to reduce dietary salt intake on an English population to prevent 
coronary heart disease (CHD).
METHODS: The validated IMPACT CHD model was used to quantify and compare four 
policies: 1) Change4Life health promotion campaign, 2) front-of-pack traffic 
light labeling to display salt content, 3) Food Standards Agency working with 
the food industry to reduce salt (voluntary), and 4) mandatory reformulation to 
reduce salt in processed foods. The effectiveness of these policies in reducing 
salt intake, and hence blood pressure, was determined by systematic literature 
review. The model calculated the reduction in mortality associated with each 
policy, quantified as life-years gained over 10 years. Policy costs were 
calculated using evidence from published sources. Health care costs for specific 
CHD patient groups were estimated. Costs were compared against a "do nothing" 
baseline.
RESULTS: All policies resulted in a life-year gain over the baseline. 
Change4life and labeling each gained approximately 1960 life-years, voluntary 
reformulation 14,560 life-years, and mandatory reformulation 19,320 life-years. 
Each policy appeared cost saving, with mandatory reformulation offering the 
largest cost saving, more than £660 million.
CONCLUSIONS: All policies to reduce dietary salt intake could gain life-years 
and reduce health care expenditure on coronary heart disease.

OBJECTIVES: To compare different chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
cost-effectiveness models with respect to structure and input parameters and to 
cross-validate the models by running the same hypothetical treatment scenarios.
METHODS: COPD modeling groups simulated four hypothetical interventions with 
their model and compared the results with a reference scenario of no 
intervention. The four interventions modeled assumed 1) 20% reduction in decline 
in lung function, 2) 25% reduction in exacerbation frequency, 3) 10% reduction 
in all-cause mortality, and 4) all these effects combined. The interventions 
were simulated for a 5-year and lifetime horizon with standardization, if 
possible, for sex, age, COPD severity, smoking status, exacerbation frequencies, 
mortality due to other causes, utilities, costs, and discount rates. 
Furthermore, uncertainty around the outcomes of intervention four was compared.
RESULTS: Seven out of nine contacted COPD modeling groups agreed to participate. 
The 5-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the most 
comprehensive intervention, intervention four, was €17,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) for two models, €25,000 to €28,000/QALY for three models, and 
€47,000/QALY for the remaining two models. Differences in the ICERs could mainly 
be explained by differences in input values for disease progression, 
exacerbation-related mortality, and all-cause mortality, with high input values 
resulting in low ICERs and vice versa. Lifetime results were mainly affected by 
the input values for mortality. The probability of intervention four to be 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay value of €50,000/QALY was 90% to 100% for 
five models and about 70% and 50% for the other two models, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was the most important factor determining the differences 
in cost-effectiveness outcomes between models.

Treating to target with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis: cost-effectiveness 
of dose reductions when remission is achieved.

Kobelt G(1).

Author information:

France. Electronic address: Gisela.Kobelt@he-europe.com.

BACKGROUND: Current management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) focuses on inducing 
remission as early as possible to avoid lasting joint damage, and maintenance of 
remission has become important. A 12-month clinical trial in 834 patients with 
moderate RA investigated whether etanercept 50 mg/wk could be reduced to half 
dose or discontinued in patients who achieved low disease activity after 36 
weeks.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
the three maintenance strategies.
METHODS: A Markov model integrated the three strategies from the clinical trial 
and extrapolated to 10 years using data from the Swedish RA registry. Assumed 
treatment strategies after the trial were similar in all three arms, with 
patients failing to maintain remission on half-dose etanercept or methotrexate 
alone switching to the full dose of etanercept and patients maintaining 
remission on full-dose etanercept allowed switching to half dose. Resource use 
and utilities were taken from an observational study. Results are presented as 
cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (both discounted 3%) in the societal 
perspective.
RESULTS: The cost/QALY gained with half-dose etanercept versus methotrexate 
ranged from €14,000 to €29,000: Longer simulations result in a higher cost/QALY, 
as the acquisition cost of etanercept increases. Half-dose etanercept 
technically dominates the full dose (lower costs [€-3000 to 6300] and similar 
effectiveness [0.007-0.011]).
CONCLUSIONS: Although ultimately all three strategies explored achieve a similar 
outcome as all three continuously manage patients to maintain remission, it 
appears that a dose reduction is the most advantageous strategy in patients with 
moderate disease activity.

OBJECTIVES: The NADiA ProsVue is a prognostic system that measures 
prostate-specific antigen slope to identify men at lower risk of clinical 
recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. We developed a 
decision-modeling framework to evaluate its cost-effectiveness to guide the use 
of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART).
METHODS: We populated the model using patient-level data and external sources. 
Patients were classified as intermediate risk or high risk on the basis of 
Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) nomogram and then 
stratified by the ProsVue slope (≤2 pg/mL/mo; >2 pg/mL/mo) and receipt of ART. 
In sensitivity analyses, we varied the effect of the ProsVue slope on the use of 
ART and other model parameters.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of the ProsVue-guided strategy varied widely 
because of small differences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 10 years. 
In the intermediate-risk group, when the use of ART decreased from 20% (standard 
care) to 7.5% among patients with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less, 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25,160/QALY. In the high-risk 
group, the use of ART would have to decrease from 40% (standard care) to 11.5% 
among those with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less to obtain a ratio 
of $50,000/QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to varying 
benefits of salvage therapy, quality of life, and costs of ART and ProsVue 
testing.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the ProsVue system on costs will be dependent on the 
extent to which ART decreases among men identified as having a low risk of 
recurrence. Its effect on QALYs will remain conditional on uncertain clinical 
and quality-of-life benefits associated with ART.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented insulin pump 
therapy with "Low Glucose Suspend" (LGS) functionality versus standard pump 
therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes 
who have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.
METHODS: A clinical trial-based economic evaluation was performed in which the 
net costs and effectiveness of the two treatment modalities were calculated and 
expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The clinical 
outcome of interest for the evaluation was the rate of severe hypoglycemia in 
each arm of the LGS study. Quality-of-life utility scores were calculated using 
the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Resource use costs were 
estimated using public sources.
RESULTS: After 6 months, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with 
LGS significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoglycemia compared with 
standard pump therapy (incident rate difference 1.85 [0.17-3.53]; P = 0.037). 
Based on a primary randomized study, the ICER per severe hypoglycemic event 
avoided was $18,257 for all patients and $14,944 for those aged 12 years and 
older. Including all major medical resource costs (e.g., hospital admissions), 
the ICERs were $17,602 and $14,289, respectively. Over the 6-month period, the 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $40,803 for patients aged 12 
years and older.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the Australian experience evaluating new interventions 
across a broad range of therapeutic areas, sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy 
with LGS may be considered a cost-effective alternative to standard pump therapy 
with self-monitoring of blood glucose in hypoglycemia unaware patients with type 
1 diabetes.
