calorie restriction and its influence on reproductive capabilities of cells. In 
this paper, we propose another approach to this issue based on analysis the 
connection between energy-producing and biomass formation pathways which are 
closed in the metabolic triangle, i.e., the respiration-glycolysis-pentose 
phosphate pathway. The analyses were based on the use of cells lacking 
hexokinase 2 (∆hxk2) and conditions of different glucose concentration 
corresponding to the calorie restriction and the calorie excess. Hexokinase 2 is 
the key enzyme involved in central carbon metabolism and is also treated as a 
calorie restriction mimetic. The experimental model used allows us to explain 
both the role of increased respiration as an effect of calorie restriction but 
also other aspects of carbon metabolism and the related metabolic flux in 
regulation of reproductive potential of the cells. The obtained results reveal 
that increased respiration is not a prerequisite for reproductive potential 
extension but rather an accompanying effect of the positive role of calorie 
restriction. More important seems to be the changes connected with fluxes in 
central carbon metabolic pathways resulting in low biosynthetic capabilities and 
improved proteostasis.

BACKGROUND: The quantity, quality, and type (e.g., animal and vegetable) of 
human food have been correlated with human health, although with some 
contradictory or neutral results. We aimed to shed light on this association by 
using the integrated data at country level.
METHODS: We correlated elemental (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) compositions 
and stoichiometries (N:P ratios), molecular (proteins) and energetic traits 
(kilocalories) of food of animal (terrestrial or aquatic) and vegetable origin, 
and alcoholic beverages with cancer prevalence and mortality and life expectancy 
(LE) at birth at the country level. We used the official databases of United 
Nations (UN), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, World 
Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of 
Health, and Eurobarometer, while also considering other possibly involved 
variables such as income, mean age, or human development index of each country.
RESULTS: The per capita intakes of N, P, protein, and total intake from 
terrestrial animals, and especially alcohol were significantly and positively 
associated with prevalence and mortality from total, colon, lung, breast, and 
prostate cancers. In contrast, high per capita intakes of vegetable N, P, N:P, 
protein, and total plant intake exhibited negative relationships with cancer 
prevalence and mortality. However, a high LE at birth, especially in 
underdeveloped countries was more strongly correlated with a higher intake of 
food, independent of its animal or vegetable origin, than with other variables, 
such as higher income or the human development index.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses, thus, yielded four generally consistent conclusions. 
First, the excessive intake of terrestrial animal food, especially the levels of 
protein, N, and P, is associated with higher prevalence of cancer, whereas 
equivalent intake from vegetables is associated with lower prevalence. Second, 
no consistent relationship was found for food N:P ratio and cancer prevalence. 
Third, the consumption of alcoholic beverages correlates with prevalence and 
mortality by malignant neoplasms. Fourth, in underdeveloped countries, reducing 
famine has a greater positive impact on health and LE than a healthier diet.

In this review, we summarize up-to-date reports with 5-year survival after 
endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for superficial esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma. In ESD for the depth of the epithelium (m1) or lamina propria (m2), 
the 5-year cause-specific survival and 5-year overall survival rates were 
reported to be 98-100%, and 85-95%, respectively. In cases with submucosal 
invasion or vascular involvement, additional prophylactic treatment such as 
chemoradiotherapy or surgery was recommended, and the 5-year cause-specific 
survival and 5-year overall survival rates were reported to be 85-100%, and 
56-84%, respectively. Additional treatment might be too invasive for the elderly 
or patients with severe comorbidities. The risk of additional therapy should be 
balanced against the risk of lymph node metastasis, considering the life 
expectancy of such patients.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tenecteplase improved functional outcomes and reduced 
the requirement for endovascular thrombectomy in ischemic stroke patients with 
large vessel occlusion in the EXTEND-IA TNK randomized trial. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase versus alteplase in this trial.
METHODS: Post hoc within-trial economic analysis included costs of index 
emergency department and inpatient stroke hospitalization, 
rehabilitation/subacute care, and rehospitalization due to stroke within 90 
days. Sources for cost included key study site complemented by published 
literature and government websites. Quality-adjusted life-years were estimated 
using utility scores derived from the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. 
Long-term modeled cost-effectiveness analysis used a Markov model with 7 health 
states corresponding to 7 modified Rankin Scale scores. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Within the 202 patients in the randomized controlled trial, total cost 
was nonsignificantly lower in the tenecteplase-treated patients (40 997 
Australian dollars [AUD]) compared with alteplase-treated patients (46 188 AUD) 
for the first 90 days(P=0.125). Tenecteplase was the dominant treatment strategy 
in the short term, with similar cost (5412 AUD [95% CI, -13 348 to 2523]; 
P=0.181) and higher benefits (0.099 quality-adjusted life-years [95% CI, 
0.001-0.1967]; P=0.048), with a 97.4% probability of being cost-effective. In 
the long-term, tenecteplase was associated with less additional lifetime cost 
(96 357 versus 106 304 AUD) and greater benefits (quality-adjusted life-years, 
7.77 versus 6.48), and had a 100% probability of being cost-effective. Both 
deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: Both within-trial and long-term economic analyses showed that 
tenecteplase was highly likely to be cost-effective for patients with acute 
stroke before thrombectomy. Recommending the use of tenecteplase over alteplase 
could lead to a cost saving to the healthcare system both in the short and long 
term. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier:

Aging and age-related neurodegeneration are among the major challenges in modern 
medicine because of the progressive increase in the number of elderly in the 
world population. Nutrition, which has important long-term consequences for 
health, is an important way to prevent diseases and achieve healthy aging. The 
beneficial effects of Vigna unguiculata on metabolic disorders have been widely 
documented. Here, we show that an aqueous extract of V. unguiculata beans delays 
senescence both in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, in a 
Snf1/AMPK-dependent manner. Consistently, an increased expression of FOXO, 
SIRT1, NOTCH and heme oxygenase (HO) genes, already known to be required for the 
longevity extension in D. melanogaster, is also shown. Preventing α-synuclein 
self-assembly is one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease (PD), for which aging is a risk factor. In vitro aggregation 
of α-synuclein, its toxicity and membrane localization in yeast and 
neuroblastoma cells are strongly decreased in the presence of bean extract. In a 
Caenorhabditis elegans model of PD, V. unguiculata extract substantially reduces 
the number of the age-dependent degeneration of the cephalic dopaminergic 
neurons. Our findings support the role of V. unguiculata beans as a functional 
food in age-related disorders.

Three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of cells in microscopy images is crucial to 
accurately capture signals that extend across optical sections. Using 
brightfield images for segmentation has the advantage of being minimally 
phototoxic and leaving all other channels available for signals of interest. 
However, brightfield images only readily provide information for two-dimensional 
(2D) segmentation. In radially symmetric cells, such as fission yeast and many 
bacteria, this 2D segmentation can be computationally extruded into the third 
dimension. However, current methods typically make the simplifying assumption 
that cells are straight rods. Here, we report Pomegranate, a pipeline that 
performs the extrusion into 3D using spheres placed along the topological 
skeletons of the 2D-segmented regions. The diameter of these spheres adapts to 
the cell diameter at each position. Thus, Pomegranate accurately represents 
radially symmetric cells in 3D even if cell diameter varies and regardless of 
whether a cell is straight, bent or curved. We have tested Pomegranate on 
fission yeast and demonstrate its ability to 3D segment wild-type cells as well 
as classical size and shape mutants. The pipeline is available as a macro for 
the open-source image analysis software Fiji/ImageJ. 2D segmentations created 
within or outside Pomegranate can serve as input, thus making this a valuable 
extension to the image analysis portfolio already available for fission yeast 
and other radially symmetric cell types.

BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental 
disorder with multisystem comorbidities that evolve across a patient's lifespan 
requiring attentive coordination of subspecialty care by primary care providers. 
A comprehensive, up-to-date synthesis of medical comorbidities in RTT would aid 
care coordination and anticipatory guidance efforts by healthcare providers. Our 
objective was to review and summarise published evidence regarding prevalence of 
RTT medical comorbidities across all relevant organ systems.
METHODS: Search of PubMed from January 2000 to July 2019 was performed using the 
search terms (Rett and MECP2 AND patient) OR (Rett and MECP2 AND cohort). 
Articles reporting the prevalence of clinical findings in RTT were assessed with 
respect to the size and nature of the cohorts interrogated and their relevance 
to clinical care.
RESULTS: After review of over 800 records, the multisystem comorbidities of RTT 
were summarised quantitatively from 18 records comprising both retrospective and 
prospective cohorts (31-983 subjects). Neurological comorbidities had the 
highest prevalence, occurring in nearly all individuals with gastrointestinal 
and orthopaedic concerns almost as prevalent as neurological. With the exception 
of low bone mineral content which was relatively common, endocrine comorbidities 
were seen in only around one-third of patients. Although more prevalent compared 
with the general population, cardiac conduction abnormalities were the least 
common comorbidity in RTT.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective care coordination for RTT requires knowledge of and 
attention to multiple comorbidities across multiple unrelated organ systems. 
Many issues common to RTT can potentially be managed by a primary care provider 
but the need for sub-specialist referral can be anticipated. Since the median 
life expectancy extends into the sixth decade with evolving subspecialty 
requirements throughout this time, paediatric providers may be tasked with 
continued coordination of these comorbidities or transitioning to adult medicine 
and specialists with experience managing individuals with complex medical needs.

The chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood, is a recently established pest in 
the USA and poses a serious risk to many economically important ornamental and 
food crops. In this study the biological control potential of the phytoseiid 
mites Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman and McGregor) and Amblyseius swirskii 
(Athias-Henriot) was compared by examining their predation and oviposition rates 
when fed different developmental stages of S. dorsalis. Gravid females were 
offered 10 individuals of either first instar, second instar, or adult S. 
dorsalis using a no-choice leaf disc bioassay and oviposition and predation 
rates were assessed daily for 2 and 3 days, respectively. There was no 
significant difference in predation and oviposition rates between mite species 
fed specific S. dorsalis life stages. There was, however, a significant effect 
of S. dorsalis life stage on the oviposition and predation rates observed for 
each mite species. The larval stage was the most preferred stage for both mite 
species, with A. swirskii consuming 4.6-6.3 and A. limonicus 4.8-6.4 
individuals/day compared to only 1.6-1.7 adults/day consumed by both species. 
Female A. swirskii and A. limonicus laid 0.55-0.75 and 0.73 eggs/day on the two 
larval stages, respectively, compared to only 0.25-0.30 eggs/day observed for 
individuals feeding on adults. Although the results showed that the biological 
control potential of both mite species was similar, having an additional 
predator available that may be as effective as A. swirskii, a proven control 
agent against S. dorsalis in the field, warrants additional research into its 
potential utility.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review article, we will highlight ethical issues 
faced by hematologists due to a growing constellation of expensive diagnostics 
and therapeutics in hematology. We outline the important issues surrounding this 
topic including stakeholders, cost considerations, and various ethical 
challenges surrounding access to care, communication about costs, and individual 
vs. societal responsibilities. We review available tools to navigate these 
ethical themes and offer potential solutions.
RECENT FINDINGS: We identified several gaps in the literature on the topic of 
ethical issues in hematology treatment and supplement by non-hematological 
cancer and general medical literature. We propose proactive solutions to address 
these problems to include cost transparency, utilization of evidence-based 
decision making tools, application of the four quadrant approach to ethical 
care, and advanced systems-based practice curriculum for physician trainees.

As of October 2020, there are >1 million documented deaths with COVID-19. Excess 
deaths can be caused by both COVID-19 and the measures taken. COVID-19 shows 
extremely strong risk stratification across age, socioeconomic factors, and 
clinical factors. Calculation of years-of-life-lost from COVID-19 is 
methodologically challenging and can yield misleading over-estimates. Many early 
deaths may have been due to suboptimal management, malfunctional health systems, 
hydroxychloroquine, sending COVID-19 patients to nursing homes, and nosocomial 
infections; such deaths are partially avoidable moving forward. About 10% of the 
global population may be infected by October 2020. Global infection fatality 
rate is 0.15-0.20% (0.03-0.04% in those <70 years), with large variability 
across locations with different age-structure, institutionalization rates, 
socioeconomic inequalities, population-level clinical risk profile, public 
health measures, and health care. There is debate on whether at least 60% of the 
global population must be infected for herd immunity, or, conversely, mixing 
heterogeneity and pre-existing cross-immunity may allow substantially lower 
thresholds. Simulations are presented with a total of 1.58-8.76 million COVID-19 
deaths over 5-years (1/2020-12/2024) globally (0.5-2.9% of total global deaths). 
The most favorable figures in that range would be feasible if high risk groups 
can be preferentially protected with lower infection rates than the remaining 
population. Death toll may also be further affected by potential availability of 
effective vaccines and treatments, optimal management and measures taken, 
COVID-19 interplay with influenza and other health problems, reinfection 
potential, and any chronic COVID-19 consequences. Targeted, precise management 
of the pandemic and avoiding past mistakes would help minimize mortality.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the health and productivity burden of 
migraines in Australia, measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs, a novel measure of productivity), and 
associated health-care and broader economic costs.
METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was constructed to simulate follow-up 
of Australians aged 20-64 years over the next 10 years. The model was first run 
using current prevalence estimates of migraine. It was then rerun assuming that 
people with migraine hypothetically did not have the condition. Differences in 
outcomes between the 2 model simulations represented the health and productivity 
burden attributable to migraine. All data inputs were obtained from published 
sources. Gross domestic product (GDP) per equivalent full-time worker in 
Australia was used to reflect the cost of each PALY (AU$177,092). Future costs 
and outcomes were discounted by 5% annually.
RESULTS: Currently, 1,274,319 million (8.5%) Australians aged 20-64 years have 
migraine. Over the next 10 years, migraine was predicted to lead to a loss of 
2,577,783 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2,054,980 to 3,000,784) QALYs among this 
cohort (2.02 per person and 2.43% of total QALYs), and AU$1.67 (95% CI $1.16 to 
$2.37) billion in health-care costs (AU$1313 per person, 95% CI $914 to $1862). 
There would also be 384,740 (95% CI 299,102 to 479,803) PALYs lost (0.30 per 
person and 0.53% of total PALYs), resulting in AU$68.13 (95% CI $44.42 to 
$98.25) billion of lost GDP (AU$53,467 per person, 95% CI $34,855 to $77,102).
CONCLUSION: Migraines impose a substantial health and economic burden on 
Australians of working age. Funding interventions that reduce the prevalence of 
migraines and/or its effects are likely to provide sound return on investment.

OBJECTIVE: Health state utility values (HSUVs) are a key input in health 
economic modeling, but HSUVs of people with osteoarthritis (OA)-related 
conditions have not been systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed. Our 
objective was to systematically review and meta-analyze the HSUVs for people 
with OA.
METHODS: Searches within health economic/biomedical databases were performed to 
identify eligible studies reporting OA-related HSUVs. Data on study design, 
participant characteristics, affected OA joint sites, treatment type, HSUV 
elicitation method, considered health states, and the reported HSUVs were 
extracted. HSUVs for people with knee, hip, and mixed OA in pre- and 
posttreatment populations were meta-analyzed using random effects models.
RESULTS: A total of 151 studies were included in the systematic review, and 88 
in meta-analyses. Of 151 studies, 56% were conducted in Europe, 75% were in 
people with knee and/or hip OA, and 79% were based on the EuroQoL 5-dimension 
instrument. The pooled mean baseline HSUVs for knee OA core interventions, 
medication, injection, and primary surgery treatments were 0.64 (95% confidence 
interval [95% CI] 0.61-0.66), 0.56 (95% CI 0.45-0.68), 0.58 (95% CI 0.50-0.66), 
and 0.52 (95% CI 0.49-0.55), respectively. These were 0.71 (95% CI 0.59-0.84) 
for hip OA core interventions and 0.52 (95% CI 0.49-0.56) for hip OA primary 
surgery. For all knee OA treatments and hip OA primary surgery, pooled HSUVs 
were significantly higher in the post- than the pretreatment populations.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive summary of OA-related HSUVs and 
generates an HSUV database for people with different affected OA joint sites 
undergoing different treatments to guide HSUV choices in future health economic 
modeling of OA interventions.

The objective of this study is to show the impact of the early death of the 
elderly, especially those who are financially responsible for families, on the 
income of other family members. It is considered to be premature, because death 
occurs at an age where life expectancy is positive and different from zero. The 
concern arises from the finding that 74.7% of the deaths recorded by Covid-19 
until 8/13/2020 occurred in individuals aged 60 years or older, of which 56.4% 
were men. For example, at age 60 a male individual could still expect to live 
another 18.1 years, given the health conditions prevailing in 2018.

Publisher: O objetivo deste trabalho é mostrar o impacto da morte precoce de 
idosos, em especial dos que são responsáveis financeiros da família, na renda 
desta. Considera-se como precoce, porque o óbito ocorre a uma idade onde a 
expectativa de vida é positiva e diferente de zero. A preocupação surge da 
constatação de que 74,7% das mortes registradas por Covid-19 até 13/08/2020 
ocorreram em Indivíduos com 60 anos ou mais, dos quais 56,4% eram homens. Por 
exemplo, aos 60 anos um Indivíduo do sexo masculino ainda poderia esperar viver 
mais 18,1 anos, dadas as condições de saúde vigentes em 2018.

BACKGROUND: Data regarding the prevalence of anemia in inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) patients are scarce in Brazil. Anemia and iron deficiency anemia 
have been known to cause significant functional impairment, lower quality of 
life, and higher morbidity and mortality and may be correlated with an impact on 
the cost of treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors 
for anemia and iron deficiency anemia in patients with IBD in a tertiary IBD 
unit in Southeast Brazil.
METHODS: We conducted an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective 
analysis of an adult IBD cohort (IBD Unit, Ribeirão Preto Medical School, 
University of São Paulo, Brazil) consisting of 579 patients between January 2014 
and July 2018. Clinicoepidemiological data, hemoglobin measurements and serum 
ferritin were extracted from electronic medical records. Anemia prevalence was 
calculated among ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) phenotypes. 
Risk factors for anemia were also calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 529 (91%) patients had complete blood counts available in 
their medical records. Only 35.5% of IBD patients were fully screened for 
anemia. The prevalence of anemia in IBD patients was 24.6% (29.1% in CD and 
19.1% in UC, P=0.008). The anemia was moderate to severe in 16.9% (19.8% in CD 
and 11.4% in UC, P=0.34). The prevalence of iron deficiency was 52.3% (53.6% in 
CD and 51.2% in UC, P=0.95). Anemia of chronic disease was present in 14.1% of 
IBD patients. A total of 53.8% of patients with anemia were in clinical 
remission. CD was associated with an increased prevalence of anemia (P=0.008; 
OR=1.76; CI 95% =1.16-2.66) compared to UC. The penetrant disease phenotype in 
CD was associated with a lower risk of anemia (P<0.0001; OR=0.25; CI 95% 
=0.14-0.43). Active disease compared to the disease in clinical remission was 
associated with an increased risk of anemia (P=0.0003; OR=2.61; CI 95% 
=1.56-4.36) in CD. The presence of anemia was less frequent in patients with CD 
who underwent surgical bowel resection compared to those who did not undergo 
surgery (P<0.0001; OR=0.24; CI 95% =0.14-0.40). No differences in anemia 
prevalence were observed regarding CD localization, age at diagnosis, UC 
extension or biological therapy (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Despite the low levels of full screening, anemia and iron deficiency 
anemia were common manifestations of IBD. CD was associated with an increased 
risk of anemia, especially with active disease. In addition, patients with CD 
who underwent surgical bowel resection and penetrant disease phenotype in CD 
were associated with lower risk of anemia.

Patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder of adult onset, were found less than 9 years of life expectancy after 
onset. The disorders include bradykinesia and rigidity commonly seen in 
Parkinsonism disease and additional signs such as autonomic dysfunction, ataxia, 
or dementia. In clinical treatments, MSA poorly responds to levodopa, the drug 
used to remedy Parkinsonism disease. The exact cause of MSA is still unknown, 
and exploring a therapeutic solution to MSA remains critical. A transgenic mouse 
model was established to study the feasibility of human adipose-derived stem 
cell (ADSC) therapy in vivo. The human ADSCs were transplanted into the striatum 
of transgenic mice via intracerebral injection. As compared with sham control, 
we reported significantly enhanced rotarod performance of transgenic mice 
treated with ADSC at an effective dose, 2 × 105 ADSCs/mouse. Our ex vivo 
feasibility study supported that intracerebral transplantation of ADSC might 
alleviate striatal degeneration in MSA transgenic mouse model by improving the 
nigrostriatal pathway for dopamine, activating autophagy for α-synuclein 
clearance, decreasing inflammatory signal, and further cell apoptosis, improving 
myelination and cell survival at caudate-putamen.

BACKGROUND: Recent improvements in life expectancy in many countries stem from 
reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer above the age of 60. 
This is the combined result of decreased incidence and improved survival among 
those with disease. The latter has led to a higher proportion in the population 
of people with a past history of disease. This is a group with higher mortality 
than the general population. How growing shares of persons with past history of 
disease and improved survival with disease have affected changes in life 
expectancy of the total population is the objective of this paper.
METHODS: Using register data for the total Swedish population, we stratified the 
population based on whether individuals have been diagnosed with myocardial 
infarction, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer, or breast cancer. Using a novel 
decomposition approach, we decomposed the changes in life expectancy at age 60 
between 1994 and 2016 into contributions from improved survival with disease and 
from changes in proportion of people with past history of disease.
RESULTS: Improvements in survival from disease resulted in gains of life 
expectancy for the total population. However, while the contributions to life 
expectancy improvements from myocardial infarction, stroke and breast cancer 
were substantial, the contributions from the other diseases were minor. These 
gains were counteracted, to various degrees, by the increasing proportion of 
people with raised mortality due to a past history of disease. For instance, the 
impact on life expectancy by improved survival from breast cancer was almost 
halved by the increasing share of females with a past history of breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: Rising numbers of survivors of different diseases can slow the 
increase in life expectancy. This dynamic may represent the costs associated 
with successful treatment of diseases, and thus, a potential "failure of 
success." This dynamic should be considered when assessing mortality and life 
expectancy trends. As populations are aging and disease survival continues to 
improve, this issue is likely to become even more important in the future.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hand and wrist impairment are frequently present following 
stroke and severely limit independence in everyday life. The wrist orientates 
and stabilizes the hand before and during grasping, and is therefore of critical 
importance in activities of daily living (ADL). To improve rehabilitation 
outcomes, classical therapy could be supplemented by novel therapies that can be 
applied in unsupervised settings. This would enable more distributed practice 
and could potentially increase overall training dose. Robotic technology offers 
new possibilities to address this challenge, but it is critical that devices for 
independent training are easy and appealing to use. Here, we present the 
development, characterization and wearability evaluation of a fully portable 
exoskeleton for active wrist extension/flexion support in stroke rehabilitation.
METHODS: First we defined the requirements, and based on these, constructed the 
exoskeleton. We then characterized the device with standardized haptic and 
human-robot interaction metrics. The exoskeleton is composed of two modules 
placed on the forearm/hand and the upper arm. These modules weigh 238 g and 224 
g, respectively. The forearm module actively supports wrist extension and 
flexion with a torque up to 3.7 Nm and an angular velocity up to 530 deg/s over 
a range of 154∘. The upper arm module includes the control electronics and 
battery, which can power the device for about 125 min in normal use. Special 
emphasis was put on independent donning and doffing of the device, which was 
tested via a wearability evaluation in 15 healthy participants and 2 stroke 
survivors using both qualitative and quantitative methods.
RESULTS: All participants were able to independently don and doff the device 
after only 4 practice trials. For healthy participants the donning and doffing 
process took 61 ±15 s and 24 ±6 s, respectively. The two stroke survivors donned 
and doffed the exoskeleton in 54 s/22 s and 113 s/32 s, respectively. Usability 
questionnaires revealed that despite minor difficulties, all participants were 
positive regarding the device.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes an actuated wrist exoskeleton which weighs 
less than 500 g, and which is easy and fast to don and doff with one hand. Our 
design has put special emphasis on the donning aspect of robotic devices which 
constitutes the first barrier a user will face in unsupervised settings. The 
proposed device is a first and intermediate step towards wearable rehabilitation 
technologies that can be used independently by the patient and in unsupervised 
settings.

Deaths due to opioid overdose have reached unprecedented levels in Canada; over 
12,800 opioid-related deaths occurred between January 2016 and March 2019, and 
overdose death rates increased by approximately 50% from 2016 to 2018.1 In 2016, 
Health Canada declared the opioid epidemic a national public health crisis,2 and 
life expectancy increases have halted in Canada for the first time in decades.3 
Children are not exempt from this crisis, and the Chief Public Health Officer of 
Canada has recently prioritized the prevention of problematic substance use 
among Canadian youth.4.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib vs 
docetaxel and bevacizumab in third-line treatment in EGFR T790M resistance 
mutation advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China from the perspective of 
the health care system.
METHODS: To explore modeling uncertainty, 2 different model methods (a Markov 
model and a partitioned survival [PS] model) were developed to simulate costs 
and health outcomes during a lifetime. Both models consisted of 3 health states: 
progression-free survival, postprogression survival, and death. Efficacy and 
safety data of osimertinib vs docetaxel and bevacizumab in patients who had 
acquired EGFR T790M resistance mutation were derived from a key head-to-head 
clinical trial. Cost and utility values were derived from local charges, the 
literature, the China Drug Bidding Database, and patients' health care 
documents. Two scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to 
explore the robustness of the results.
FINDINGS: In the Markov model, compared with docetaxel and bevacizumab, 
osimertinib yielded 0.69 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an 
additional cost (in US dollars) of $17,311 for an incremental cost-utility ratio 
(ICUR) of $25,463 per QALY. In the PS model, osimertinib yielded an additional 
0.69 QALYs with an incremental cost of $17,827 for an ICUR of $25,951 per QALY. 
From the Markov model, the ICUR was $29,416 per QALY in scenario 1 and $25,543 
per QALY in scenario 2. From the PS model, the ICUR was $30,264 per QALY and 
$25,947 per QALY for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, osimertinib treatment had a 21%-63% probability of being 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $9777 to $29,330 per QALY 
(1-3 times the gross domestic product per capita).
IMPLICATIONS: The findings from the present analysis suggest that osimertinib 
could be cost-effective vs docetaxel and bevacizumab in third-line treatment in 
EGFR T790M resistance mutation advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China.

We propose a model for the replication of primordial protocell genomes that 
builds upon recent advances in the nonenzymatic copying of RNA. We suggest that 
the original genomes consisted of collections of oligonucleotides beginning and 
ending at all possible positions on both strands of one or more virtual circular 
sequences. Replication is driven by feeding with activated monomers and by the 
activation of monomers and oligonucleotides in situ. A fraction of the annealed 
configurations of the protocellular oligonucleotides would allow for 
template-directed oligonucleotide growth by primer extension or ligation. 
Rearrangements of these annealed configurations, driven either by environmental 
fluctuations or occurring spontaneously, would allow for continued 
oligonucleotide elongation. Assuming that shorter oligonucleotides were more 
abundant than longer ones, replication of the entire genome could occur by the 
growth of all oligonucleotides by as little as one nucleotide on average. We 
consider possible scenarios that could have given rise to such protocell 
genomes, as well as potential routes to the emergence of catalytically active 
ribozymes and thus the more complex cells of the RNA World.
