BACKGROUND: COVID-19 remains a major public health challenge, requiring the 
development of tools to improve diagnosis and inform therapeutic decisions. As 
dysregulated inflammation and coagulation responses have been implicated in the 
pathophysiology of COVID-19 and sepsis, we studied their plasma proteome 
profiles to delineate similarities from specific features.
METHODS: We measured 276 plasma proteins involved in Inflammation, organ damage, 
immune response and coagulation in healthy controls, COVID-19 patients during 
acute and convalescence phase, and sepsis patients; the latter included (i) 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Influenza, (ii) bacterial CAP, 
(iii) non-pneumonia sepsis, and (iv) septic shock patients.
RESULTS: We identified a core response to infection consisting of 42 proteins 
altered in both COVID-19 and sepsis, although higher levels of cytokine 
storm-associated proteins were evident in sepsis. Furthermore, microbiologic 
etiology and clinical endotypes were linked to unique signatures. Finally, 
through machine learning, we identified biomarkers, such as TRIM21, PTN and 
CASP8, that accurately differentiated COVID-19 from CAP-sepsis with higher 
accuracy than standard clinical markers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the understanding of host responses underlying 
sepsis and COVID-19, indicating varying disease mechanisms with unique 
signatures. These diagnostic and severity signatures are candidates for the 
development of personalized management of COVID-19 and sepsis.

In recent years, microbial food safety has garnered a lot of attention due to 
worldwide expansion of the food industry and processed food products. This has 
driven the development of novel preservation methods over traditional ones. 
Food-derived antimicrobial peptides (F-AMPs), produced by the proteolytic 
degradation of food proteins, are emerging as pragmatic alternatives for 
extension of the shelf-life of food products. The main benefits of F-AMPs are 
their wide spectrum antimicrobial efficacy and low propensity for the 
development of antibiotic resistance. However, direct application of F-AMPs in 
food limits its efficacy during storage. Therefore, the development of 
nanocarriers for the conjugation and distribution of potential AMPs may hold 
great potential to increase their bioactivity. This review highlights the 
significance of F-AMPs as a feasible and sustainable alternative to conventional 
food preservatives. The most recent developments in production, 
characterization, and mode of action of these AMPs against planktonic and 
biofilm forming pathogens are thoroughly discussed in this work. Moreover, 
nano-conjugation of F-AMPs with different nano-carriers and potential future 
application in food packaging are emphasized. This review may aid in 
comprehending the nano-conjugation of F-AMPs and offer insightful 
recommendations for further exploration and potential uses in the food 
processing industry.

The European hedgehog is in decline, triggering a need to monitor population 
dynamics to optimise conservation initiatives directed at this species. By 
counting periosteal growth lines, we determined the age of 388 dead European 
hedgehogs collected through citizen science in Denmark. The overall mean age was 
1.8 years (1.6 years for females and 2.1 years for males), ranging between 0 and 
16 years. We constructed life tables showing life expectancies at 2.1 years for 
females and 2.6 years for males. We discovered that male hedgehogs were more 
likely to have died in traffic than females, but traffic-related deaths peaked 
in July for both sexes. A sex difference was detected for non-traffic deaths, as 
most males died in July, and most females died in September. We created 
empirical survivorship curves and hazard curves showing that the risk of death 
for male hedgehogs remains approximately constant with age. In contrast, the 
risk of death for females increases with age. Most of the collected road-killed 
individuals died in rural habitats. The degree of inbreeding did not influence 
longevity. These new insights are important for preparing conservation 
strategies for the European hedgehog.

Normal cells under stressful conditions such as DNA damage or excessive 
mitogenic signaling may undergo senescence, which is associated with cell cycle 
arrest and induction of a proinflammatory phenotype. Accumulation of senescent 
cells may contribute to the shortening of the life span by accelerating aging 
and promoting chronic diseases. Cytochemical detection of the 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity with 
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) is a widely recognised 
marker of cell senescence. However, its simplicity and cost effectiveness lead 
to limitations in quantification, which is usually limited to manual counting of 
the positive cells. In order to address those limitations, we developed a 
Fiji-based macro extension that performs automatic and unbiased analysis of the 
integrated density of SA-β-gal specific signal. Our tool is not only faster than 
manual counting but also provides extra resolution compared to the manual 
methods. Our macro extension could be a valuable tool in any senescence research 
laboratory.

Metabolic syndrome is a complex disease state, which appears mostly as a 
consequence of an unhealthy, sedentary lifestyle. Metabolic complications 
include insulin resistance (IR), diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and 
atherosclerosis, impairing life standards and reducing life expectancy. The 
endocannabinoid system (ECS) has an important role in signalization processes, 
not only in the central nervous system, but also in the peripheral tissues. 
Several physiological functions are affected, and overexpression or 
downregulation contributes to several diseases. A better understanding of the 
functions of cannabinoid (CB) receptors may propose potential therapeutic 
effects by influencing receptor signaling and enzymes involved in downstream 
pathways. In this review, we summarize recent information regarding the roles of 
the ECS and the CB1 receptor signaling in the physiology and pathophysiology of 
energy and metabolic homeostasis, in the development of obesity by enhancing 
food intake, upregulating energy balance and fat accumulation, increasing 
lipogenesis and glucose production, and impairing insulin sensitivity and 
secretion. By analyzing the roles of the ECS in physiological and 
pathophysiological mechanisms, we introduce some recently identified signaling 
pathways in the mechanism of the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Our review 
emphasizes that the presence of such recently identified ECS signaling steps 
raises new therapeutic potential in the treatment of complex metabolic diseases 
such as diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, and hypertension.

PURPOSE: We examined a prospective consecutive cohort of low dose rate (LDR) 
brachytherapy for prostate cancer to evaluate the efficacy of monotherapy for 
unfavorable-intermediate risk (UIR) disease, and explore factors associated with 
toxicity and quality of life (QOL).
METHODS: 149 men with prostate cancer, including 114 staged with MRI, received 
Iodine-125 brachytherapy alone (144-145 Gy) or following external beam radiation 
therapy (110 Gy; EBRT). Patient-reported QOL was assessed by the Expanded 
Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) survey, and genitourinary (GU) and 
gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were prospectively recorded (CTC v4.0). Global 
QOL scores were assessed for decline greater than the minimum clinically 
important difference (MCID). Univariate analysis (UVA) was performed, with 
30-day post-implant dosimetry covariates stratified into quartiles. Median 
follow-up was 63 mo.
RESULTS: Men with NCCN low (n = 42) or favorable-intermediate risk (n = 37) 
disease were treated with brachytherapy alone, while most with high-risk disease 
had combined EBRT (n = 17 of 18). Men with UIR disease (n = 52) were selected 
for monotherapy (n = 42) based on clinical factors and MRI findings. Freedom 
from biochemical failure-7 yr was 98%. Of 37 men with MRI treated with 
monotherapy for UIR disease, all 36 men without extraprostatic extension were 
controlled. Late Grade 2+/3+ toxicity occurred in 55/3% for GU and 8/2% for GI, 
respectively. Fifty men were sexually active at baseline and had 2 yr sexual 
data; 37 (74%) remained active at 2 yr. Global scores for urinary incontinence 
(UC), urinary irritation/obstruction (UIO), bowel function, and sexual function 
(SF) showed decreases greater than the MCID (p < 0.05) in UC at 2 mo, UIO at 2 
and 6 mo, and SF at 2-24 mo, and >5 yr. Analysis did not reveal any significant 
associations with any examined rectal or urethral dosimetry for late toxicity or 
QOL.
CONCLUSION: Disease outcomes and patient-reported QOL support LDR brachytherapy, 
including monotherapy for UIR disease.

Do We Need Palliative Care in Pediatric Nephrology? Patients' and Caregivers' 
Disease Experience.

Chronic life-limiting illnesses such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) require 
integral support to the families concerned in addition to medical care. 
Palliative care is an option to facilitate families to address future concerns, 
such as procedures for acute life-threatening complications, or to relieve 
physical and psychosocial suffering. The exact needs of patients or parents have 
not yet been investigated. To assess needs in supportive palliative care, we 
conducted a monocentric qualitative interview study. We included patients 14 to 
24 years old as well as parents of younger children (below 14 years) with CKD ≥ 
stage 3. In total, fifteen interviews were conducted. Data were analyzed with a 
deductive and descriptive approach using qualitative content analysis as 
described by Mayring. Sociodemographic data and basic information of disease 
were collected using questionnaires. In contrast to caregivers, adolescents and 
young adults do not express worries about their own mortality or reduced life 
expectancy. Rather, they report about their limitations to everyday life 
associated with the disease, especially in the areas of school and work. They 
wish to live a normal life. Caregivers are concerned about the future and the 
disease trajectory. They also describe difficulties in balancing the management 
of the disease with other responsibilities such as work and healthy siblings' 
needs. Patients and caregivers appear to need a chance to talk about their 
everyday struggles and disease-related fears and concerns. Talking about their 
concerns and needs may help deal with their emotions and facilitate acceptance 
of their situation characterized by a life-limiting disease. Our study confirms 
the need for psychosocial support in pediatric nephrology to address the needs 
of the affected families. This can be offered by pediatric palliative care 
teams.

Thermodynamic Assessment of the Effects of Intermittent Fasting and Fatty Liver 
Disease Diets on Longevity.

Organisms uptake energy from their diet and maintain a highly organized 
structure by importing energy and exporting entropy. A fraction of the generated 
entropy is accumulated in their bodies, thus causing ageing. Hayflick's entropic 
age concept suggests that the lifespan of organisms is determined by the amount 
of entropy they generate. Organisms die after reaching their lifespan entropy 
generation limit. On the basis of the lifespan entropy generation concept, this 
study suggests that an intermittent fasting diet, which means skipping some 
meals without increasing the calories uptake in the other courses, may increase 
longevity. More than 1.32 million people died in 2017 because of chronic liver 
diseases, and a quarter of the world's population has non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease. There are no specific dietary guidelines available for the treatment of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases but shifting to a healthier diet is 
recommended as the primary treatment. A healthy obese person may generate 119.9 
kJ/kg K per year of entropy and generate a total of 4796 kJ/kg K entropy in the 
first 40 years of life. If obese persons continue to consume the same diet, they 
may have 94 years of life expectancy. After age 40, Child-Pugh Score A, B, and C 
NAFLD patients may generate 126.2, 149.9, and 272.5 kJ/kg K year of entropy and 
have 92, 84, and 64 years of life expectancy, respectively. If they were to make 
a major recommended shift in their diet, the life expectancy of Child-Pugh Score 
A, B, and C patients may increase by 29, 32, and 43 years, respectively.

Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the 
α-galactosidase-A enzyme. The result is the progressive accumulation of complex 
glycosphingolipids and cellular dysfunction. Cardiac, renal, and neurological 
involvement significantly reduces life expectancy. Currently, there is 
increasing evidence that clinical response to treatment improves with early and 
timely initiation. Until a few years ago, treatment options for Fabry disease 
were limited to enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa or beta 
administered by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. Migalastat (Galafold®) is an 
oral pharmacological chaperone that increases the enzyme activity of "amenable" 
mutations. The safety and efficacy of migalastat were supported in the phase III 
FACETS and ATTRACT studies, compared to available enzyme replacement therapies, 
showing a reduction in left ventricular mass, and stabilization of kidney 
function and plasma Lyso-Gb3. Similar results were confirmed in subsequent 
extension publications, both in patients who started migalastat as their first 
treatment and in patients who were previously on enzyme replacement therapy and 
switched to migalastat. In this review we describe the safety and efficacy of 
switching from enzyme replacement therapy to migalastat in patients with Fabry 
disease and "amenable" mutations, referring to publications available to date.

Background: Due to the increase in life expectancy, both the general population 
and the population of patients of emergency departments (ED) are getting older. 
An understanding of differences, workload and resource requirements may be 
helpful in improving patient care. The main goal of this study was to evaluate 
the reasons for geriatric admissions in the ED, identify typical medical 
problems and assess the number of resources in order to provide more effective 
management. Methods: We examined 35,720 elderly patients' ED visits over the 
course of 3 years. The data collected included age, sex, timing and length of 
stay (LOS), use of various resources, endpoint (admission, discharge or death) 
and ICD-10 diagnoses. Results: The median age was 73 years [66-81], with more 
females (54.86%). There were 57.66% elderly (G1), 36.44% senile (G2) and 5.89% 
long-liver (G3) patients. There were more females in the older groups. The total 
admission rate was 37.89% (34.19% for G1, 42.21% for G2 and 47.33% for G3). The 
average length of the patient's stay was 150 min [81-245] (G3 180 min [108-277], 
G2 (162 min [92-261]) and G1 139 min [71-230]). Heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation and hip fracture were the most common diagnoses. Nonspecific 
diagnoses were common in all groups. Conclusion: The vast majority of geriatric 
patients required considerable resources. With increasing ages, the number of 
women, LOS and number of admissions increased.

The average age of fathers at first pregnancy has risen significantly over the 
last decade owing to various variables, including a longer life expectancy, more 
access to contraception, later marriage, and other factors. As has been proven 
in several studies, women over 35 years of age have an increased risk of 
infertility, pregnancy problems, spontaneous abortion, congenital malformations, 
and postnatal issues. There are varying opinions on whether a father's age 
affects the quality of his sperm or his ability to father a child. First, there 
is no single accepted definition of old age in a father. Second, much research 
has reported contradictory findings in the literature, particularly concerning 
the most frequently examined criteria. Increasing evidence suggests that the 
father's age contributes to his offspring's higher vulnerability to inheritable 
diseases. Our comprehensive literature evaluation shows a direct correlation 
between paternal age and decreased sperm quality and testicular function. 
Genetic abnormalities, such as DNA mutations and chromosomal aneuploidies, and 
epigenetic modifications, such as the silencing of essential genes, have all 
been linked to the father's advancing years. Paternal age has been shown to 
affect reproductive and fertility outcomes, such as the success rate of in vitro 
fertilisation (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and premature 
birth rate. Several diseases, including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorders, and paediatric leukaemia, have been linked to the father's advanced 
years. Therefore, informing infertile couples of the alarming correlations 
between older fathers and a rise in their offspring's diseases is crucial, so 
that they can be effectively guided through their reproductive years.

BACKGROUND: The experiences in coping with HIV/AIDS from people living with HIV 
(PLWH) in Austria, Munich, and Berlin regarding adherence, antiretroviral 
therapy (ART), stigmatization, and discrimination were the main focus of this 
study. Therapy adherence is the cornerstone for PLWH to reduce disease 
progression and increase life expectancy combined with a high quality of life. 
The experience of stigmatization and discrimination in different life situations 
and settings is still experienced today.
AIMS: We aimed to examine the subjective perspective of PLWH concerning living 
with, coping with, and managing HIV/AIDS in daily life.
METHODS: Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM) was used. Data collection was 
conducted with semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 25 participants. 
Data analysis was performed in three steps, open, axial, and selective coding.
RESULTS: Five categories emerged, which included the following: (1) fast coping 
with diagnosis, (2) psychosocial burden due to HIV, (3) ART as a necessity, (4) 
building trust in HIV disclosure, (5) stigmatization and discrimination are 
still existing.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it can be said that it is not the disease itself that 
causes the greatest stress, but the process of coping with the diagnosis. 
Therapy, as well as lifelong adherence, is hardly worth mentioning today. Much 
more significant is currently still the burden of discrimination and 
stigmatization.

This article studies the relationship between environmental governance, public 
health expenditure, and economic growth by introducing human health status into 
a three-period overlapping generation dynamic general equilibrium (OLG-DGE) 
model and conducting a policy simulation analysis in a Chinese scenario. The 
main findings are generalized as follows: (i) The increase in pollution 
emissions per unit of output will not only lead to the deterioration of public 
health but also hinder long-term economic growth, while the efficiency of 
pollution control will improve health and output per labor unit; (ii) Although 
levying environmental tax will improve health status and life expectancy, it has 
a non-linear impact on pollution emissions and output per labor unit, which 
means that there are trade-offs among environmental governance, public health 
improvement, and economic output; and (iii) Although the increase in the 
proportion of public health expenditure will improve health status, its impact 
on life expectancy and economic output is affected by the level of environmental 
tax. Only when the environmental tax rate is relatively low, will increasing the 
proportion of public health expenditure extend life expectancy and output per 
labor unit.

Emerging contaminants, which mainly exist as organic pollutants and pose adverse 
biological effects, could be removed using photocatalytic degradation, resulting 
in a low-cost and environmentally friendly solution. Herein, BiVO4 nanoparticles 
with different morphologies and photocatalytic performances were synthesized by 
hydrothermal treatment at different residence times. The XRD and SEM results 
indicate that the crystal phase of BiVO4 gradually transformed from a single 
tetragonal phase to a single monoclinic crystal phase as the hydrothermal time 
increased, and with the extension of the hydrothermal time, the morphology of 
BiVO4 nanoparticles gradually differentiated from a smooth spherical shape to 
flower-like shapes composed of polyhedrons; the size of the crystals also 
increased accordingly. Methylene blue (MB), used as a probe of organic 
pollutants, was degraded under visible light irradiation by all BiVO4 samples to 
investigate its photocatalytic activities. The experimental results show that 
the longer the hydrothermal time, the better the photocatalytic performance. The 
optimum hydrothermal time was 24 h, at which the sample showed the highest 
photocatalytic activity for MB degradation. This work shows a convenient 
strategy for control of the crystal phase of BiVO4-based photocatalysts based on 
the understanding of the crystal morphology evolution mechanism, which will 
benefit the researchers in designing new BiVO4-based photocatalysts with high 
efficiency for emerging contaminants' degradation.

Wastewater storage before reuse is regulated in some countries. Investigations 
of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater storage 
are necessary for lowering the risks for wastewater reuse but are still mostly 
lacking. This study aimed to investigate pathogens, including harmful plant 
pathogens, and ARGs during 180 d of swine wastewater (SWW) storage in an 
anaerobic storage experiment. The contents of total organic carbon and total 
nitrogen in SWW were found to consistently decrease with the extension of 
storage time. Bacterial abundance and fungal abundance significantly decreased 
with storage time, which may be mainly attributed to nutrient loss during 
storage and the long period of exposure to a high level (4653.2 μg/L) of 
sulfonamides in the SWW, which have an inhibitory effect. It was found that 
suspected bacterial pathogens (e.g., Escherichia-Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., 
Arcobacter spp., Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 spp., and Pseudomonas spp.) and 
sulfonamide-resistant genes Sul1, Sul2, Sul3, and SulA tended to persist and 
even become enriched during SWW storage. Interestingly, some suspected plant 
fungal species (e.g., Fusarium spp., Ustilago spp. and Blumeria spp.) were 
detected in SWW. Fungi in the SWW, including threatening fungal pathogens, were 
completely removed after 60 d of anaerobic storage, indicating that storage 
could lower the risk of using SWW in crop production. The results clearly 
indicate that storage time is crucial for SWW properties, and long periods of 
anaerobic storage could lead to substantial nutrient loss and enrichment of 
bacterial pathogens and ARGs in SWW.

BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been used for venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) in Thailand. However, they have not been listed in the 
National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). A cost-effectiveness analysis is 
needed to aid policymakers in deciding whether DOACs should be listed in the 
NLEM. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of DOACs for patients 
with VTE in Thailand.
METHODS: A cohort-based state transition model was constructed from a societal 
perspective with a lifetime horizon. All available DOACs, including apixaban, 
rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran, were compared with warfarin. A 6-month 
cycle length was used to capture all costs and health outcomes. The model 
consisted of nine health states, including VTE on treatment, VTE off treatment, 
recurrent VTE, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, intracranial bleeding, post-intracranial bleeding, chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and death. All inputs were based on a 
comprehensive literature review. The model outcomes included total cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with a 3% annual discount rate. A fully 
incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) per QALY gained were calculated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 
THB 160,000/QALY ($5003). The robustness of the findings was assessed using 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: All DOACs were associated with a decreased risk of VTE recurrence and 
intracranial hemorrhage. In the base-case analysis, apixaban could increase 0.16 
QALYs compared with warfarin. An ICER for apixaban was 269,809 Thai baht 
(THB)/QALY ($8437/QALY). Rivaroxaban had a better QALY than warfarin at 0.09 
QALYs with an ICER of 757,363 THB/QALY ($23,682/QALY). Edoxaban and dabigatran 
could also increase by 0.10 QALYs with an ICER of 709,945 THB ($22,200) and 
707,145 THB ($22,122)/QALY, respectively. Our probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
indicated that warfarin had a 99.8% possibility of being cost-effective, while 
apixaban had a 0.2% possibility of being cost-effective at the current WTP. 
Other DOACs had no possibility of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: All DOACs were not cost-effective for VTE treatment at the current 
WTP in Thailand. Apixaban is likely to be the best option among DOACs.

BACKGROUND: Brain cancer is one of the worst types of cancer worldwide. 
Understanding the epidemiology of CNS cancer is critical for properly allocating 
healthcare resources.
METHODS: We collected data on CNS cancer deaths in Wuhan, China, during 
2010-2019. We constructed the cause-eliminated life tables to calculate life 
expectancy (LE), mortality, and years of life lost (YLLs) by age and sex. The 
BAPC model was used to forecast the future trends of age-standardized mortality 
rate (ASMR). Decomposition analysis was adopted to explore the contribution of 
population growth, population aging, and age-specific mortality to the change in 
total CNS cancer deaths.
RESULTS: In 2019, the ASMR of CNS cancer was 3.75, and the ASYR was 135.70 in 
Wuhan, China. ASMR was expected to decrease to 3.43 in 2024. The age 
distribution of deaths due to CNS cancer was concentrated in the middle-aged and 
older population, with a peak in the 65-69 age group. Caidian, Jianghan, and 
Qingshan had the greatest ASMRs in 2019 in Wuhan, with ASMRs of 6.32, 4.78, and 
4.75, respectively. Population aging is critical to the change in total CNS 
cancer deaths.
CONCLUSION: We analyzed the current status, temporal trends, and gender and age 
distributions of the burden of CNS cancer in Wuhan, during 2010-2019, providing 
a valuable reference for better lessening the CNS cancer burden.

Current research on the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) gene has yielded 
controversial results on whether different ACE polymorphisms are linked with 
human longevity. ACE polymorphisms are a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and 
age-onset diseases that may contribute to the mortality of older people. Our 
goal is to consolidate existing studies, using artificial intelligence-assisted 
software to come to a more precise understanding of the role of the ACE gene in 
human longevity. The I (insertion) and D (deletion) polymorphisms in the intron 
are correlated with the levels of circulating ACE; homozygous D (DD) is high, 
and homozygous I (II) is low. Here, we performed a detailed meta-analysis of the 
I and D polymorphisms using centenarians (100+ years old), long-lived subjects 
(85+ years old), and control groups. ACE genotype distribution was analyzed 
across a total of 2054 centenarians and 12,074 controls, as well as 1367 
long-lived subjects between the ages of 85-99, using the inverse variance and 
random effects methods. The ACE DD genotype was found to be favored in 
centenarians (OR: 1.41 (95% CI: 1.19-1.67), p < 0.0001) with a heterogeneity of 
32%, and the II genotype slightly favored the control groups (OR: 0.81 (95% CI: 
0.66-0.98), p = 0.03) with a heterogeneity of 28%, corroborating results from 
previous meta-analyses. Novel to our meta-analysis, the ID genotype was found to 
be favored in control groups (OR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76-0.97), p = 0.01) with a 
heterogeneity of 0%. The long-lived group showed a similar positive association 
between the DD genotype and longevity (OR: 1.34 (95% CI: 1.21-1.48), p < 0.0001) 
and a negative association between the II genotype and longevity (OR: 0.79 (95% 
CI: 0.70-0.88), p < 0.0001). The long-lived ID genotype did not show significant 
findings (OR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.84-1.02), p = 0.79). In conclusion, the results 
suggest a significant positive association of the DD genotype with human 
longevity. However, despite the previous study, the results do not confirm a 
positive association of the ID genotype with human longevity. We suggest a few 
important paradoxical implications: (1) inhibition of ACE can increase longevity 
in model systems from nematodes to mammals, seemingly opposite to the finding in 
humans; (2) exceptional longevity associated with homozygous DD is also 
associated with age-related diseases with higher mortality risks in homozygous 
DD. We discuss ACE, longevity, and age-related diseases.

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in age-related diseases 
due to the improvement in life expectancy worldwide. The pancreas undergoes 
various morphological and pathological changes with aging, such as pancreatic 
atrophy, fatty degeneration, fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and 
exocrine pancreatic metaplasia. Meanwhile, these may predispose the individuals 
to aging-related diseases, such as diabetes, dyspepsia, pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma, and pancreatitis, as the endocrine and exocrine functions of the 
pancreas are significantly affected by aging. Pancreatic senescence is 
associated with various underlying factors including genetic damage, DNA 
methylation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
inflammation. This paper reviews the alternations of morphologies and functions 
in the aging pancreas, especially β-cells, closely related to insulin secretion. 
Finally, we summarize the mechanisms of pancreatic senescence to provide 
potential targets for treating pancreatic aging-related diseases.

Cancer is the leading cause of death and represents a significant economic 
burden worldwide. The numbers are constantly growing as a result of increasing 
life expectancy, toxic environmental factors, and adoption of Western lifestyle. 
Among lifestyle factors, stress and the related signaling pathways have recently 
been implicated in the development of tumors. Here we present some 
epidemiological and preclinical data concerning stress-related activation of the 
ß-adrenoreceptors (ß-ARs), which contributes to the formation, sequential 
transformation, and migration of different tumor cell types. We focused our 
survey on research results for breast and lung cancer, melanoma, and gliomas 
published in the past five years. Based on the converging evidence, we present a 
conceptual framework of how cancer cells hijack a physiological mechanism 
involving ß-ARs toward a positive modulation of their own survival. In addition, 
we also highlight the potential contribution of ß-AR activation to tumorigenesis 
and metastasis formation. Finally, we outline the antitumor effects of targeting 
the ß-adrenergic signaling pathways, methods for which primarily include 
repurposed ß-blocker drugs. However, we also call attention to the emerging 
(though as yet largely explorative) method of chemogenetics, which has a great 
potential in suppressing tumor growth either by selectively modulating neuronal 
cell groups involved in stress responses affecting cancer cells or by directly 
manipulating specific (e.g., the ß-AR) receptors on a tumor and its 
microenvironment.

Wolfram syndrome 1 (WS1) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease 
caused by mutations in WFS1 and WFS2 genes that produce wolframin, a protein 
involved in endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and cellular apoptosis. 
Its main clinical features are diabetes insipidus (DI), early-onset 
non-autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM), gradual loss of vision 
due to optic atrophy (OA) and deafness (D), hence the acronym DIDMOAD. Several 
other features from different systems have been reported such as urinary tract, 
neurological, and psychiatric abnormalities. In addition, endocrine disorders 
that can appear during childhood and adolescence include primary gonadal atrophy 
and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in males and menstrual cycle abnormalities in 
females. Further, anterior pituitary dysfunction with deficient GH and/or ACTH 
production have been described. Despite the lack of specific treatment for the 
disease and its poor life expectancy, early diagnosis and supportive care is 
important for timely identifying and adequately managing its progressive 
symptoms. The current narrative review focuses on the pathophysiology and the 
clinical features of the disease, with a special emphasis on its endocrine 
abnormalities that appear during childhood and adolescence. Further, therapeutic 
interventions that have been proven to be effective in the management of WS1 
endocrine complications are discussed.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) affect the West due to the increase in life 
expectancy. Nervous cells accumulate oxidative damage, which is one of the 
factors that triggers and accelerates neurodegeneration. However, cells have 
mechanisms that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviate oxidative 
stress (OS). Many of these endogenous antioxidant systems are regulated at the 
gene expression level by the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 
2-related factor 2). In the presence of prooxidant conditions, Nrf2 translocates 
to the nucleus and induces the transcription of genes containing ARE 
(antioxidant response element). In recent years, there has been an increase in 
the study of the Nrf2 pathway and the natural products that positively regulate 
it to reduce oxidative damage to the nervous system, both in in vitro models
