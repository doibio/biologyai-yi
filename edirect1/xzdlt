INTRODUCTION: Total hip arthroplasty in young patients has evolved in recent 
decades, and the use of short stems in young adult patients has been gaining 
popularity. The restitution of the biomechanics of the hip is a primary 
requirement to determine the future success of total hip replacement, and even 
more so in young adults who present the particularity of having a high 
functional demand and a long life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the learning curve 
and initial clinical-radiological outcomes of the Alteon Neck Preserving Stem™ 
(ANPS) (Exactech, Gainesville, FL, USA) with a minimum of 2 years follow up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter prospective study that analyzed 
90 consecutive total hip replacements during 2014. We performed a 
clinical-radiological analysis measuring Harris Hip Score (HHS), subjective 
Rodes and Maudsley satisfaction evaluation, radiolucencies, components position, 
limb length discrepancy, heterotopic ossification, medical and surgical 
complications and learning curve.
RESULTS: During the first 30 cases, the intraoperative complication rate was 
16%, while in the next 60 cases no intraoperative complications were reported. 
Thigh pain was reported in 3 cases (3.3%), being 2 moderates, and 1 severe. In 2 
cases subsidences of 3 mm were detected in the first scheduled X-ray, both 
related to intraoperative fractures with no progression after 3 months. Mean HHS 
improved from 42.9 points (range 37-54 points) preoperatively to 93.2 on average 
(range, 87-96) at the end of the follow up (p < 0.01). Subjective evaluation was 
excellent in 75 (83.3%) cases and good in 15 patients (16.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: This short stem has good clinical radiological results in a short 
and medium term follow-up and in the hands of surgeons specializing in 
arthroplasty the learning curve is estimated to be less than 30 surgeries.

The objectives of the study were to calculate the standardised mortality rates 
(SMRs) for COVID-19 in European Union/European Economic Area countries plus the 
UK and Switzerland and to evaluate the correlation between SMRs and selected 
indicators in the first versus the subsequent waves until 23 June 2021. We used 
indirect standardisation (using Italy as the reference) to compute SMRs and 
considered 16 indicators of health and social well-being, health system capacity 
and COVID-19 response. The highest SMRs were in Belgium, the UK and Spain in the 
first wave (1.20-1.84) and in Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia in the subsequent 
waves (2.50-2.69). Human Development Index (HDI), life expectancy, urbanisation 
and healthcare expenditure had positive correlations with SMR in the first wave 
(rho=0.30-0.46), but negative correlations (rho=-0.67 to -0.47) in the 
subsequent waves. Retail/recreation mobility and transit mobility were 
negatively correlated with SMR in the first wave, while transit mobility was 
inversely correlated with SMR in the subsequent waves. The first wave hit most 
hard countries with high HDI, high life expectancy, high urbanisation, high 
health expenditures and high tourism. This pattern may reflect higher early 
community seeding and circulation of the virus. Conversely, in the subsequent 
waves, this pattern was completely inversed: countries with more resources and 
better health status did better than eastern European countries. While major SMR 
differences existed across countries in the first wave, these differences 
largely dissipated by 23 June 2021, with few exceptions.

Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs) including antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 
antigen-4 and programmed cell death 1 have been shown to be effective in the 
treatment of certain types of cancer. The benefit of these therapies is to 
prolong life expectancy in the case of metastatic malignancies. Rheumatic 
adverse events are not very common. In the present study, 9 patients were 
monitored between November 2018 and January 2020. The oncologist, who identified 
the occurrence of rheumatic toxicities after the treatment with ICIs, evaluated 
the patients. Only oncological patients with rheumatic manifestations after the 
start of immunotherapy were included. Toxicity grading was performed by both the 
oncologist and the rheumatologist, on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, mild; 2, moderate; 
3, severe; 4, life-threatening; 5, death related to toxicity). The results 
showed that rheumatoid factor, which was sampled in each patient, was negative 
in all cases. Patients were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or 
prednisone depending on the severity of the adverse events. The results varied 
with the severity of the adverse events. In conclusion, as the number of 
patients treated with ICIs increases, so will the number of patients presenting 
with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The collaboration between 
oncologists and rheumatologists should be intimate to provide optimal treatment 
to patients. Musculoskeletal manifestations secondary to ICIs are slightly 
different from other rheumatologically conditions making diagnosis, treatment 
and monitoring difficult. Thus, irAEs are new and challenging for oncologists, 
thus understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics must be 
improved for better treatment guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are 
recommended to be added in sequentially in the treatment of moderate-to-severe 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All these drugs, however, are substantially more 
expensive than conventional synthetic DMARDs throughout the world, including in 
China. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
treatment sequences of bDMARDs for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid 
arthritis from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was used to track the course of 
patients from first treatment through switches to further lines in a sequence. 
The comparator treatment sequence commenced with methotrexate, followed by 
non-biologic therapy. The intervention sequences were assumed to be the 
combinations of bDMARDs available, followed by non-biologic therapy. Life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and lifetime costs were estimated. 
Univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were 
performed to evaluate the model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared with the comparator treatment sequence, bDMARDs sequences were 
associated with more life years, QALYs, and cost. These produced ICERs ranged 
from $27,441.36/QALY to $40,149.2/QALY, above the willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $10,378 per QALY. The uncertainty analyses and the scenario analyses 
confirmed the result of the base case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system, bDMARDs 
sequences are estimated not to be cost-effective compared with conventional 
synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug strategy for patients with 
moderate-to-severe RA at a WTP threshold of $10,378 per QALY. Price reductions 
are warranted to make bDMARDs cost-effective and affordable.

BACKGROUND: Migraine is associated with depression as well as negative impact on 
quality of life and work productivity. Fremanezumab, a fully humanized 
monoclonal antibody (IgG2Δa), selectively targets the calcitonin gene-related 
peptide and has proven efficacy for the preventive treatment of migraine.
OBJECTIVE: In this open-label extension (OLE) of the phase 3b FOCUS study, we 
assessed patient-reported outcomes (PROs) over time.
METHODS: Patients with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) 
completing the 12-week, double-blind (DB) period of the FOCUS trial entered the 
12-week OLE and received three monthly doses of fremanezumab (225 mg). PROs 
included the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQoL) questionnaire (role 
function-restrictive [RFR], role function-preventive [RFP], and emotional 
function [EF] domains), EuroQol-5-Dimension-5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) assessment, Work Productivity and 
Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire, and 9-Item Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
RESULTS: A total of 838 patients were randomized in the DB period, 807 entered 
the OLE at 3 months, and 772 were still enrolled at 6 months. At 6 months, 
patients in the quarterly fremanezumab, monthly fremanezumab, and placebo DB 
randomization groups, respectively, reported improvements in RFR (mean [standard 
deviation] change from baseline: 24.6 [21.9]; 22.9 [21.3]; 20.8 [26.5]), RFP 
(19.6 [20.0]; 18.3 [19.7]; 16.0 [19.9]), and EF (22.5 [24.2]; 19.1 [23.6]; 17.2 
[24.7]) domains of the MSQoL questionnaire, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (8.0 
[19.6]; 7.3 [21.1]; 6.6 [21.0]), all four domains of the WPAI questionnaire, and 
the PHQ-9 (-2.4 [5.3]; -1.6 [5.5]; -2.0 [4.9]); 77.1% (209/271), 75.4% 
(205/272), and 68.8% (181/263) of patients were identified as PGIC responders.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with EM or CM and prior inadequate response to 
multiple migraine-preventive medication classes, progressive improvements in 
MSQoL, depression, and work productivity were achieved during 6 months of 
fremanezumab treatment.

Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PMT), as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has 
been widely used in the prevention and treatment of aging-related diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, hyperlipidemia, 
atherosclerosis and inflammation. However, the effect of PMT on the lifespan and 
its molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here we found that 60% ethanol 
refined fraction (PMT-E) of Polygonum multiflorum Thunb at 50 μg mL-1, which 
contained two main bioactive compounds, 
2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside (TSG) and 
emodin-8-O-β-D-glucoside (EG), could significantly increase the mean lifespan by 
19.82%, delay the age-related decline of phenotypes, enhance stress resistance 
and reduce ROS accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover, we also found 
that the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and ATP content of worms treated 
with 50 μg mL-1 PMT-E were obviously improved. Further mechanistic studies 
revealed that DAF-16, SIR-2.1 and SKN-1 transcription factors were required for 
PMT-E-mediated lifespan extension. Finally, we found that PMT-E could 
significantly inhibit the toxicity induced by β-amyloid (Aβ) in Aβ transgenic 
worms. Altogether, these findings laid the foundation for the use of Polygonum 
multiflorum Thunb to treat aging and age-related diseases.

OBJECTIVES: This study examines total life expectancies (TLEs) for both healthy 
and diabetic U.S.-born populations and 2 measures capturing quality of life: (a) 
the proportion of remaining life to be spent without either other chronic 
conditions or activities of daily living disabilities (ADLs) and (b) the 
proportion of remaining life to be spent with ADLs for U.S.-born diabetic 
populations by race/ethnicity and educational attainment.
METHODS: Using the 1998-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (n = 
16,983), we apply a Bayesian multistate life table method to calculate these 
quantities from the constructed life tables.
RESULTS: TLE at age 50 is shorter for diabetic individuals than healthy 
individuals, for non-Hispanic Blacks than members of other racial/ethnic groups, 
and for less-educated individuals. Gaps in TLE at age 50 between healthy and 
diabetic populations range from 6.3 to 8.8 years across sex-race combinations 
and from 5.6 to 9.2 years across sex-education combinations. Among the diabetic 
population, those with at least a college degree on average have a higher 
proportion of remaining life to be spent without either other chronic conditions 
or ADLs. Hispanics and those without a college degree have a particularly high 
proportion of remaining life to be spent with ADLs. Although diabetic women on 
average live longer than men, their quality of life tends to be lower.
DISCUSSION: The impact of diabetes on population health varies across 
racial/ethnic and educational groups. The findings support targeted 
interventions for vulnerable groups, such as people of color, women, and 
less-educated individuals.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study is to validate and compare 
four of the most widely used staging systems for juvenile angiofibroma on a 
homogeneous cohort of patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated with endoscopic or 
endoscopic-assisted surgical resection between 1999 and 2020 was carried out. 
Each case was classified according to the following staging systems: 
Andrews-Fisch (1989), Radkowski (1996), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center 
(2010), and Janakiram (2017). Spearman's rank correlation test and areas under 
the curve of receiver operator curves were used to assess the correlation 
between outcomes of interests (blood loss, surgical time, need for transfusion, 
and persistence of disease) and stage of disease.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were included, with a median follow-up time of 
25 months (range 12-127 months). Median surgical time was 217 minutes (range 
52-625). Median blood loss was 500 mL (range 40-5200) and 27 patients (34.2%) 
required blood transfusions. Seven patients (8.9%) showed persistence of 
disease. All classification systems showed a similar association with blood 
loss, surgical time, persistence of disease, and need for transfusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Involvement of the infratemporal fossa and intracranial extension 
was identified as red flags for surgical planning and preoperative counseling, 
as associated with increased risk for transfusion and persistent/recurrent 
disease, respectively. No classification system was found to be better than the 
others in predicting the most important outcomes. Therefore, the simplest and 
most easily applicable system would be the preferred one to be used in clinical 
practice.

Lung cancer is one of the commonest cancers with a significant mortality rate 
for both genders, particularly in men. Lung cancer is recognized as one of the 
leading causes of death worldwide, which threatens the lives of over 1.6 million 
people every day. Although cancer is the leading cause of death in 
industrialized countries, conventional anticancer medications are unlikely to 
increase patients' life expectancy and quality of life significantly. In recent 
years, there are significant advances in the development and applications of 
nanotechnology in cancer treatment. The superiority of nanostructured approaches 
is that they act more selectively than traditional agents. This progress led to 
the development of a novel field of cancer treatment known as nanomedicine. 
Various formulations based on nanocarriers, including lipids, polymers, 
liposomes, nanoparticles and dendrimers have opened new horizons in lung cancer 
therapy. The application and expansion of nano-agents lead to an exciting and 
challenging research era in pharmaceutical science, especially for the delivery 
of emerging anti-cancer agents. The objective of this review is to discuss the 
recent advances in three types of nanoparticle formulations for lung cancer 
treatments modalities, including liposomes, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers 
for efficient drug delivery. Afterward, we have summarized the promising 
clinical data on nanomaterials based therapeutic approaches in ongoing clinical 
studies.

BACKGROUND: The human resource gap in veterinary sectors, particularly in 
low-income countries, imposes limitations on the delivery of animal healthcare 
in hard-to-reach populations. Lay animal health workers have been deployed in 
these settings to fill the gap though there are mixed views about the benefits 
of doing this and whether they can deliver services safely. We mapped evidence 
on the nature and extent of roles assigned to lay animal vaccinators, and 
identified lessons useful for their future deployment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Following the PRISMA Extension for Scoping 
Reviews guidelines, we searched seven bibliographic databases for articles 
published between 1980 and 2021, with the search terms lay OR community-based OR 
volunteer AND "animal health worker" OR vaccinator*, and applied an a priori 
exclusion criteria to select studies. From 30 identified studies, lay 
vaccinators were used by non-government developmental (n = 12, 40%), research (n 
= 10, 33%) and government (n = 5, 17%) programmes to vaccinate domestic animals. 
The main reason for using lay vaccinators was to provide access to animal 
vaccination in the absence of professional veterinarians (n = 12, 40%). Reported 
positive outcomes of programmes included increased flock and herd sizes and 
farmer knowledge of best practice (n = 13, 43%); decreased disease transmission, 
outbreaks and mortality (n = 11, 37%); higher vaccination coverage (10, 33%); 
non-inferior seroconversion and birth rates among vaccinated herds (n = 3, 10%). 
The most frequently reported facilitating factor of lay vaccinator programmes 
was community participation (n = 14, 47%), whilst opposition from professional 
veterinarians (n = 8, 27%), stakeholders seeking financial gains to detriment of 
programmes goals (n = 8, 27%) and programming issues (n = 8, 27%) were the most 
frequently reported barriers. No study reported on cost-effectiveness and we 
found no record from a low and middle-income country of lay vaccinator 
programmes being integrated into national veterinary services.
CONCLUSION: Although the majority of included studies reported more benefits and 
positive perceptions of lay vaccinator programmes than problems and challenges, 
regularization will ensure the programmes can be designed and implemented to 
meet the needs of all stakeholders.

An inherited deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ASA) causes the lysosomal storage 
disease metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by massive 
intralysosomal storage of the acidic glycosphingolipid sulfatide and progressive 
demyelination. Lyso-sulfatide, which differs from sulfatide by the lack of the 
N-linked fatty acid, also accumulates in MLD and is considered a key driver of 
pathology although its concentrations are far below sulfatide levels. However, 
the metabolic origin of lyso-sulfatide is unknown. We show here that 
ASA-deficient murine macrophages and microglial cells express an 
endo-N-deacylase that cleaves the N-linked fatty acid from sulfatide. An 
ASA-deficient astrocytoma cell line devoid of this activity was used to identify 
the enzyme by overexpressing 13 deacylases with potentially matching substrate 
specificities. Hydrolysis of sulfatide was detected only in cells overexpressing 
the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). A cell-free assay with recombinant 
FAAH confirmed the novel role of this enzyme in sulfatide hydrolysis. Consistent 
with the in vitro data, deletion of FAAH lowered lyso-sulfatide levels in a 
mouse model of MLD. Regardless of the established cytotoxicity of lyso-sulfatide 
and the anti-inflammatory effects of FAAH inhibition seen in mouse models of 
several neurological diseases, genetic inactivation of FAAH did not mitigate, 
but rather exacerbated the disease phenotype of MLD mice. This unexpected 
finding was reflected by worsening of rotarod performance, increase of 
anxiety-related exploratory activity, aggravation of peripheral neuropathy, and 
reduced life expectancy. Thus, we conclude that FAAH has a protective function 
in MLD and may represent a novel therapeutic target for treatment of this fatal 
condition.

BACKGROUND: In North America, most people start hemodialysis via a central 
venous catheter ("catheter"). These patients are counseled to undergo 
arteriovenous fistula ("fistula") creation within weeks of starting hemodialysis 
because fistulas are associated with improved survival.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether attempting to create a fistula in patients who 
start hemodialysis via a catheter is associated with improved mortality. We also 
sought to determine whether differences in baseline patient characteristics, 
vascular procedures for access-related complications, or days in hospital may 
confound or mediate the relationship between attempted fistula creation and 
mortality.
DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Six dialysis programs located in Ontario, Alberta, and Manitoba.
PATIENTS: Patients aged ≥18 years who initiated hemodialysis via a catheter 
between January 1, 2004, and May 31, 2012, who had not had a previous attempt at 
fistula creation. We excluded those who had a life expectancy less than 1 year, 
who transitioned to peritoneal dialysis within 6 months of starting dialysis, 
and people who started hemodialysis via a graft.
MEASUREMENTS: Attempted fistula creation, all-cause mortality, patient 
characteristics and comorbidities, vascular procedures for access-related 
complications, and days spent in hospital.
METHODS: We used survival methods, including marginal structural models, to 
account for immortal time bias and time-varying confounding.
RESULTS: In total, 1832 patients initiated hemodialysis via a catheter during 
the study period and met inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 565 (31%) 
underwent an attempt at fistula creation following hemodialysis start. As 
compared to those who did not receive a fistula attempt, these people were 
younger, had fewer comorbidities, and were more likely to have started dialysis 
as an outpatient and to have received pre-dialysis care. In a marginal 
structural model controlling for baseline characteristics and comorbidities, 
attempted fistula creation was associated with a significantly lower mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.43-0.66). This 
effect did not appear to be confounded or mediated by differences in the number 
of days spent in hospital or vascular procedures for access-related 
complications. It also remained similar in analyses restricted to patients who 
survived at least 6 months (HR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.47-0.77) and to patients who 
started hemodialysis as an outpatient (HR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.33-0.68).
LIMITATIONS: There is likely residual confounding and treatment selection bias.
CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter cohort study, attempting fistula creation in 
people who started hemodialysis via a catheter was associated with significantly 
reduced mortality. This reduction in mortality could not be explained by 
differences in patient characteristics or comorbidities, days spent in hospital, 
or vascular procedures for access-related complications. Residual confounding or 
selection bias may explain the observed benefits of fistulas for hemodialysis 
access.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable (cohort study).

Publisher: CONTEXTE: En Amérique du Nord, la plupart des patients amorcent 
l’hémodialyse avec un cathéter veineux central (cathéter). Dans les semaines qui 
suivent le début de la dialyse, on conseille à ces patients la création d’une 
fistule artérioveineuse (fistule), cette dernière étant associée à un taux de 
survie accru.
OBJECTIF: Vérifier si la tentative de créer une fistule est associée à un 
accroissement de la survie chez les patients ayant amorcé l’hémodialyse avec un 
cathéter. Nous souhaitions aussi évaluer si les différences dans les 
caractéristiques initiales des patients, les interventions vasculaires pour 
gérer les complications liées à l’accès ou la durée du séjour pouvaient aggraver 
ou médier la relation entre la mortalité et le fait de tenter la création d’une 
fistule.
TYPE D’ÉTUDE: Étude de cohorte rétrospective menée dans plusieurs centres.
CADRE: Six programmes de dialyse situés en Ontario, en Alberta et au Manitoba.
SUJETS: Les patients adultes ayant amorcé l’hémodialyse avec un cathéter entre 
le 1er janvier 2004 et le 31 mai 2012, et n’ayant pas antérieurement tenté la 
création d’une fistule. Ont été exclus les patients ayant une espérance de vie 
inférieure à un an, ceux qui étaient passés à la dialyse péritonéale dans les 
six mois suivant le début de la dialyse, et ceux qui avaient commencé 
l’hémodialyse par un greffon artérioveineux.
MESURES: La tentative de création d’une fistule, la mortalité toutes causes 
confondues, les caractéristiques initiales et comorbidités des patients, les 
interventions vasculaires pour gérer les complications liées à l’accès et le 
nombre jours passés à l’hôpital.
MÉTHODOLOGIE: Nous avons utilisé des méthodes de survie, notamment des modèles 
structurels marginaux, pour tenir compte du biais d’immortalité et des facteurs 
confusionnels variables dans le temps.
RÉSULTATS: Au cours de la période étudiée, 1 832 patients avaient amorcé une 
hémodialyse avec un cathéter et répondaient aux critères d’inclusion. Parmi eux, 
565 (31 %) avaient tenté la création d’une fistule après le début de 
l’hémodialyse. Ces patients étaient plus jeunes, présentaient moins de 
comorbidités et étaient plus susceptibles d’avoir amorcé la dialyse en clinique 
externe et d’avoir reçu des soins de prédialyse que les patients qui n’avaient 
pas tenté la création d’une fistule. Dans un modèle structurel marginal 
contrôlant les caractéristiques initiales et les comorbidités, la tentative de 
création d’une fistule a été associée à un taux de mortalité significativement 
inférieur [risque relatif (RR) : 0,53; intervalle de confiance (IC) à 95 % : 
0,43-0,66]. Cet effet n’a pas semblé aggravé ou médié par des différences dans 
la durée du séjour à l’hôpital ou par les interventions vasculaires pour gérer 
les complications liées à l’accès. Cela est également demeuré similaire dans les 
analyses, mais uniquement chez les patients ayant survécu au moins 6 mois (RR : 
0,60; IC 95 % : 0,47-0,77) et chez les patients ayant commencé l’hémodialyse en 
clinique externe (RR : 0,48; IC 95 % : 0,33-0,68).
LIMITES: Probabilité de facteurs de confusion résiduels et de biais relatifs au 
choix du traitement.
CONCLUSION: Dans cette étude de cohorte multicentrique, la création d’une 
fistule chez des patients ayant commencé l’hémodialyse avec un cathéter a été 
associée à une réduction significative de la mortalité. Cette réduction de la 
mortalité n’a cependant pas pu être expliquée par des différences dans les 
caractéristiques ou les comorbidités des patients, par la durée du séjour à 
l’hôpital ou par les interventions vasculaires pratiquées pour gérer les 
complications liées à l’accès. Un biais de sélection ou des facteurs de 
confusion résiduels pourraient expliquer les bienfaits observés par la création 
d’une fistule pour l’accès à l’hémodialyse.

Pycnodysostosis is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by the mutation 
of CTSK gene. CTSK regulates the activity of Cathepsin K which is responsible 
for osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. This mutation causes the bones to 
become dense, sclerotic, brittle, and thus, prone to fracture. Affected 
individuals have normal cognitive development and life expectancy, however, the 
quality of life depends on the early diagnosis of the condition. The patient 
presents with striking clinical (short stature, brachydactyly) and radiological 
(frontal and parieto-occipital bossing, open sutures, and fontanelles, 
acro-osteolysis of terminal phalanges) features making the diagnosis 
clinico-radiographic. In atypical or mild cases with overlapping features, gene 
mapping is advocated. A plethora of dental anomalies and characteristic 
craniofacial dysmorphia puts the dentist in a position to diagnose such a case.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of mammography screening among Chinese women 
remains contentious. Here, we characterized breast cancer (BC) epidemiology in 
Hong Kong and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of personalized risk-based 
screening.
METHODS: We used the Hong Kong Breast Cancer Study (a case-control study with 
3501 cases and 3610 controls) and Hong Kong Cancer Registry to develop a risk 
stratification model based on well-documented risk factors. We used the Shanghai 
Breast Cancer Study to validate the model. We considered risk-based programs 
with different screening age ranges and risk thresholds under which women were 
eligible to join if their remaining BC risk at the starting age exceeded the 
threshold.
RESULTS: The lifetime risk (15-99 years) of BC ranged from 1.8% to 26.6% with a 
mean of 6.8%. Biennial screening was most cost-effective when the starting age 
was 44 years, and screening from age 44 to 69 years would reduce breast cancer 
mortality by 25.4% (95% credible interval [CrI] = 20.5%-29.4%) for all risk 
strata. If the risk threshold for this screening program was 8.4% (the average 
remaining BC risk among US women at their recommended starting age of 50 years), 
the coverage was 25.8%, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
US$18 151 (95% CrI = $10 408-$27 663) per quality-of-life-year (QALY) compared 
with no screening. The ICER of universal screening was $34 953 (95% CrI = $22 
820-$50 268) and $48 303 (95% CrI = $32 210-$68 000) per QALY compared with no 
screening and risk-based screening with 8.4% threshold, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Organized BC screening in Chinese women should commence as 
risk-based programs. Outcome data (e.g., QALY loss because of false-positive 
mammograms) should be systemically collected for optimizing the risk threshold.

BACKGROUND: To date, the economic burden and patient-reported outcomes 
associated with carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients with neuroendocrine tumor 
(NET) remain largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of 
economic and quality-of-life (QOL) studies related to the treatment of CS.
METHODS: Articles included in the review were extracted from PubMed, Embase, and 
the Cochrane Library. Studies had to be in English and published between 1 
January 2000 and 2 July 2020. Other study eligibility criteria included patients 
with NET with CS receiving treatment for CS, study outcomes of cost or QOL, and 
clinical trials or population-based studies using claims or other secondary 
databases. The interventions included somatostatin analogs, telotristat ethyl, 
or other treatment for CS. To evaluate the quality and bias of the included 
studies, the 24-item CHEERS and 10-item Gill and Feinstein checklists were used. 
We report a narrative synthesis of the findings from the selected studies.
RESULTS: A total of 12 economic and 12 QOL studies met the inclusion criteria 
and were included for review. Patients with uncontrolled CS symptoms had 23-92% 
higher costs than those with controlled CS; mostly, ambulatory/outpatient 
services were the primary drivers of the costs. The use of telotristat ethyl may 
be cost effective if the societal willingness to pay is as high as $US150,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year in the USA. Of the 12 QOL papers, only three 
case-control studies assessed QOL at baseline and more than two follow-up time 
points. Seven studies evaluated QOL at two or more time points but lacked a 
control group, obscuring direct intervention effects on patients' well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed wide variations in the reviewed studies evaluating the 
economic burden and patient-reported outcomes, in terms of cost and QOL, of 
patients with CS. Although QOL is consistently impaired and costs are 
consistently increased by CS, the numbers of both cost and QOL studies among 
this patient population remain sparse, and many of the existing studies 
indicated an important need for quality improvement.

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of hereditary 
degenerative diseases of the nervous system, in particular the cerebellum, and 
other systems that manifest with a variety of progressive motor, cognitive, and 
behavioral deficits with the leading symptom of cerebellar ataxia. SCAs often 
lead to severe impairments of the patient's functioning, quality of life, and 
life expectancy. For SCAs, there are no proven effective pharmacotherapies that 
improve the symptoms or substantially delay disease progress, i.e., 
disease-modifying therapies. To study SCA pathogenesis and potential therapies, 
animal models have been widely used and are an essential part of pre-clinical 
research. They mainly include mice, but also other vertebrates and 
invertebrates. Each animal model has its strengths and weaknesses arising from 
model animal species, type of genetic manipulation, and similarity to human 
diseases. The types of murine and non-murine models of SCAs, their contribution 
to the investigation of SCA pathogenesis, pathological phenotype, and 
therapeutic approaches including their advantages and disadvantages are reviewed 
in this paper. There is a consensus among the panel of experts that (1) animal 
models represent valuable tools to improve our understanding of SCAs and 
discover and assess novel therapies for this group of neurological disorders 
characterized by diverse mechanisms and differential degenerative progressions, 
(2) thorough phenotypic assessment of individual animal models is required for 
studies addressing therapeutic approaches, (3) comparative studies are needed to 
bring pre-clinical research closer to clinical trials, and (4) mouse models 
complement cellular and invertebrate models which remain limited in terms of 
clinical translation for complex neurological disorders such as SCAs.
