BACKGROUND: Most epidemiological risk indicators strongly depend on the age 
composition of populations, which makes the direct comparison of raw 
(unstandardized) indicators misleading because of the different age structures 
of the spatial units of study. Age-standardized rates (ASR) are a common 
solution for overcoming this confusing effect. The main drawback of ASRs is that 
they depend on age-specific rates which, when working with small areas, are 
often based on very few, or no, observed cases for most age groups. A similar 
effect occurs with life expectancy at birth and many more epidemiological 
indicators, which makes standardized mortality ratios (SMR) the omnipresent risk 
indicator for small areas epidemiologic studies.
METHODS: To deal with this issue, a multivariate smoothing model, the M-model, 
is proposed in order to fit the age-specific probabilities of death (PoDs) for 
each spatial unit, which assumes dependence between closer age groups and 
spatial units. This age-space dependence structure enables information to be 
transferred between neighboring consecutive age groups and neighboring areas, at 
the same time, providing more reliable age-specific PoDs estimates.
RESULTS: Three case studies are presented to illustrate the wide range of 
applications that smoothed age specific PoDs have in practice . The first case 
study shows the application of the model to a geographical study of lung cancer 
mortality in women. This study illustrates the convenience of considering 
age-space interactions in geographical studies and to explore the different 
spatial risk patterns shown by the different age groups. Second, the model is 
also applied to the study of ischaemic heart disease mortality in women in two 
cities at the census tract level. Smoothed age-standardized rates are derived 
and compared for the census tracts of both cities, illustrating some advantages 
of this mortality indicator over traditional SMRs. In the latest case study, the 
model is applied to estimate smoothed life expectancy (LE), which is the most 
widely used synthetic indicator for characterizing overall mortality differences 
when (not so small) spatial units are considered.
CONCLUSION: Our age-space model is an appropriate and flexible proposal that 
provides more reliable estimates of the probabilities of death, which allow the 
calculation of enhanced epidemiological indicators (smoothed ASR, smoothed LE), 
thus providing alternatives to traditional SMR-based studies of small areas.

The chemical analysis of tree rings has attracted the interest of researchers in 
the past five decades in view of the possibility of exploiting this biological 
indicator as a widely available, high-resolution environmental archive. 
Information regarding the surrounding environment can be derived either by 
directly measuring environmental variables (nutrient availability, presence of 
pollutants, etc.) or by exploiting proxies (e.g. paleoclimatic and 
paleoenvironmental reconstructions). This review systematically covers the topic 
and provides a critical view on the reliability of dendrochemical information. 
First, we introduce the determinable chemical species, such as major elements, 
trace metals, isotopic ratios, and organic compounds, together with a brief 
description of their uptake mechanisms and functions in trees. Subsequently, we 
present the possibilities offered by analytical techniques in the field of tree 
ring analysis, focusing on direct methods and recent developments. The latter 
strongly improved the details of the accessible information, enabling the 
investigation of complex phenomena associated with plant life and encouraging 
the direct analysis of new analytes, particularly minor organic compounds. With 
regard to their applications, dendrochemical proxies have been used to trace 
several processes, such as environmental contamination, paleoclimate 
reconstruction, global environmental changes, tree physiology, extreme events, 
ecological trends, and dendroprovenance. Several case studies are discussed for 
each proposed application, with special emphasis on the reliability of tracing 
each process. Starting from the reviewed literature data, the second part of the 
paper is devoted to the critical assessment of the reliability of tree ring 
proxies. We provide an overview of the current knowledge, discuss the 
limitations of the inferences that may be drawn from the dendrochemical data, 
and provide recommendations for the best practices to be used for their 
validation. Finally, we present the future perspectives related to the 
advancements in analytical instrumentation and further extension of application 
fields.

INTRODUCTION: Children with malignancy who are under treatment with nephrotoxic 
drugs are at risk of renal dysfunction. Due to increased life expectancy, 
evaluation of drug toxicity is now of higher importance than before. The aim of 
this study is to compare two methods of GFR measurement.
METHODS: An analytical study on children with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy 
with nephrotoxic drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamind, 
etoposide) during 2016 and 2017 in Mofid Children Hospital was done. Demographic 
information, anthropometric measurements, type of malignancy, type of 
chemotherapy medication and also lab tests including CBC and the biochemistry 
indices were recorded. The GFR of each patient was calculated using Schwartz 
formula and DTPA scanning. The rates were compared and the difference was 
analyzed statistically.
RESULTS: According to Schwartz formula, 24% of patients needed dose adjustment, 
while based on DTPA scanning, this rate was 6%. Comparing these two measures by 
paired T-test, showed a significant statistical difference (P < .05). Schwartz 
formula had 25.5% more positive results of predicting the need for dose 
adjustment. The two measured GFRs for each person were evaluated in terms of 
compatibility and correlation based on Kappa statistical method, which were 
incompatible and had significant difference (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Using evaluative methods including Schwartz formula cannot 
demonstrate renal dysfunctions reliability in patients taking nephrotoxic 
chemotherapy drugs. Eventually if the GFR measurement method overestimates 
patients with renal dysfunction, the patients will not be able to make adequate 
use of the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy with the appropriate dosage.

BACKGROUND: Cefepime is essentially used for life-threatening infections. 
Although overutilisation of antibiotics is strongly discouraged around the 
world, they are still overused in developing countries including Sudan.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the rational use of cefepime at Khartoum 
North Teaching Hospital-Sudan.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional, hospital-based study was conducted in 
the internal medicine ward at Khartoum North Teaching Hospital from August/2018 
to April/2019. The study covered medical records of adult patients receiving 
cefepime during the study period. Patient's data were analysed using simple 
descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) and inferential statistics 
(logistic regression) to describe the relationship between dependent and 
independent variables. P ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Out of 90 patients, only 16.7% of patients were tested for antibiotic 
sensitivity. Cefepime was prescribed to 50% and 23.3% of patients for the 
treatment of UTIs/post-dialysis and sepsis, respectively. Although the majority 
of patients (72.2%) received cefepime with appropriate indication, only 21.1% 
and 15.6% received the drug with appropriate dose and duration, respectively. 
Cefepime had been prescribed appropriately in a correct dose, duration, and 
indications for only 7.8% of patients. The vast majority of patients tested for 
kidney functions had elevated creatinine levels (96.1%); however, cefepime dose 
had been adjusted for only 4.1% of them.
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the irrational use of cefepime regarding 
inappropriate dose, duration, and inadequate antibiotic sensitivity tests. A 
lack of attention to dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment had 
been observed. Positive clinical outcome was significantly associated with 
antibiotic sensitivity test.

OBJECTIVES: In preparation for the future arrival of a group A Streptococcus 
(GAS) vaccine, this study estimated the economic and health burdens of GAS 
diseases in New Zealand (NZ).
METHODS: The annual incidence of GAS diseases was based on extrapolation of the 
average number of primary healthcare episodes managed each year in general 
practices (2014-2016) and on the average number of hospitalizations occurring 
each year (2005-2014). Disease incidence was multiplied by the average cost of 
diagnosing and managing an episode of disease at each level of care to estimate 
the annual economic burden.
RESULTS: GAS affected 1.5% of the population each year, resulting in an economic 
burden of 29.2 million NZ dollars (2015 prices) and inflicting a health burden 
of 2373 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Children <5 years of age were 
the most likely age group to present for GAS-related healthcare. Presentations 
for superficial throat and skin infections (predominantly pharyngitis and 
impetigo) were more common than other GAS diseases. Cellulitis contributed the 
most to the total economic and health burdens. Invasive and immune-mediated 
diseases disproportionately contributed to the total economic and health burdens 
relative to their frequency of occurrence.
CONCLUSION: Preventing GAS diseases would have substantial economic and health 
benefits in NZ and globally.

The influence of angular velocity on rate of torque development (RTD) is 
unknown, despite the inverse, curvilinear torque-velocity relationship for 
angle- and velocity-specific maximum available torque (Tmax) being 
well-established. This study investigated the relationship between angular 
velocity and RTD scaled to Tmax. In 17 participants, tetanic contractions 
(100-Hz) of the knee extensors were evoked as the knee was passively extended at 
different iso-velocities between 0° s-1 and 200° s-1. Each condition consisted 
of evoking 0.25-s contractions without pre-activation (for measuring RTD) 
commencing as the knee passed 95° of extension, and 1.25-s contractions with 
pre-activation (for measuring Tmax), commencing 1 s prior to the knee reaching 
95°. Torque at 100 ms after torque onset (T100) and peak RTD (RTDpeak) in the 
contractions without pre-activation were normalised to Tmax. The torque-velocity 
relationship for T100 was flat in comparison to an inverse, curvilinear 
relationship for Tmax, resulting in linear increases in normalised T100 and 
RTDpeak with increased velocity. Results also showed normalised T100 and RTDpeak 
were likely overestimated due to shortening-induced force depression (FD) which 
would be greater in contractions with- than without- pre-activation. However, 
these effects of FD cannot explain the faster normalised RTD with increased 
velocity, as the relative difference in work done (a proxy for FD) between 
contractions with and without pre-activation decreased - and thus the 
overestimation of normalised RTD metrics likely decreased - with increased 
velocity. In conclusion, RTD scaled to Tmax increases with increased velocity, 
which appears to be an intrinsic contractile property independent of the effects 
of force depression.

OBJECTIVE: The consensus is that life expectancy for individuals with 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced, but estimations vary. We aimed to provide 
an overview of 20 years of mortality and risk factor data from the Queensland 
Parkinson's Project.
METHODS: The analysis included 1,334 PD and 1,127 control participants. 
Preliminary analysis of baseline characteristics (sex, age at onset, family 
history, smoking status, pesticide exposure, depression and neurosurgery) was 
conducted, and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for each potential risk 
factor. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated comparing this 
cohort to the general Australian population. Cox proportional hazards regression 
modeling was used to analyze potential predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: In total, 625 (46.8%) PD and 237 (21.0%) control participants were 
deceased. Mean disease duration until death was 15.3 ± 7.84 years. Average ages 
at death were 78.0 ± 7.4 years and 80.4 ± 8.4 years for the deceased PD and 
control participants, respectively. Mortality was significantly increased for PD 
in general {SMR = 2.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.53-2.96]; p = 0.001}. 
SMRs were slightly higher for women and those with an age of onset before 60 
years. Multivariate analysis showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment 
was associated with lower mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; 95% CI: 
0.59-0.98], while occasional pesticide exposure increased mortality risk (HR = 
1.48; 95% CI: 1.17-1.88). Family history of PD, smoking and depression were not 
independent predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: Mortality in PD is increased. Sex, age at onset and occasional 
pesticide exposure were independent determinants of increased mortality, while 
DBS treatment was associated with reduced mortality.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge about patients' attitudes towards deprescribing is 
essential for optimizing medication use. The revised Patients' Attitudes Towards 
Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire is a 22-item self-report instrument 
capturing older patients' beliefs and attitudes towards deprescribing.
OBJECTIVES: To translate and cross-culturally adapt the rPATD questionnaire into 
Danish and subsequently validate it in a cohort of nursing home residents.
METHODS: The rPATD questionnaire was translated and cross-culturally adapted 
during five stages of forward and backward translation. The validation study 
included 162 Danish nursing home residents (median age 84 years; 67% women). 
Validity was assessed through exploratory factor analysis (structural validity) 
and hypothesis testing (construct validity), while reliability was assessed 
through internal consistency. Floor and ceiling effects were examined.
RESULTS: The exploratory factor analysis revealed a 4-factor structure similar 
to the original rPATD questionnaire, with items loading into four factors 
related to level of involvement in medication use, perceived burden of taking 
medication, belief in appropriateness of using medication, and concerns about 
stopping medication. The questionnaire was adjusted to the Danish nursing home 
population and health care system by omission of two items, concerning 
medication expenses and inconvenience of taking medication, which resulted in a 
model with factor loadings ranging from 0.29 to 0.84 and only minor 
cross-loading. Construct validity correctly predicted 67% of the hypothesized 
correlations. Internal consistency of all factors was generally acceptable with 
Cronbach's α ranging from 0.67 to 0.78. No floor and ceiling effects were 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the Danish modified model of the rPATD 
questionnaire generally has acceptable validity and reliability.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early liver transplantation (LT) for alcoholic hepatitis (AH) 
is lifesaving but concerns regarding return to harmful alcohol use remain. We 
sought to identify distinct patterns of alcohol use post-LT to inform pre-LT 
candidate selection and post-LT addiction care.
METHODS: Detailed post-LT alcohol use data was gathered retrospectively from 
consecutive patients with severe AH at 11 ACCELERATE-AH sites from 2006-2018. 
Latent class analysis identified longitudinal patterns of alcohol use post-LT. 
Logistic and Cox regression evaluated associations between patterns of alcohol 
use with pre-LT variables and post-LT survival. A microsimulation model 
estimated the effect of selection criteria on overall outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 153 LT recipients, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were 95%, 88% and 
82%. Of 146 LT recipients surviving to home discharge, 4 distinct longitudinal 
patterns of post-LT alcohol use were identified: Pattern 1 [abstinent](n = 103; 
71%), pattern 2 [late/non-heavy](n = 9; 6.2%), pattern 3 [early/non-heavy](n = 
22; 15%), pattern 4 [early/heavy](n = 12; 8.2%). One-year survival was similar 
among the 4 patterns (100%), but patients with early post-LT alcohol use had 
lower 5-year survival (62% and 53%) compared to abstinent and late/non-heavy 
patterns (95% and 100%). Early alcohol use patterns were associated with younger 
age, multiple prior rehabilitation attempts, and overt encephalopathy. In 
simulation models, the pattern of post-LT alcohol use changed the average 
life-expectancy after early LT for AH.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant majority of LT recipients for AH maintain longer-term 
abstinence, but there are distinct patterns of alcohol use associated with 
higher risk of 3- and 5-year mortality. Pre-LT characteristics are associated 
with post-LT alcohol use patterns and may inform candidate selection and post-LT 
addiction care.

BACKGROUND: A significant percentage of patients who acutely develop high-grade 
atrioventricular block after valve surgery will ultimately recover, yet the 
ability to predict recovery is limited. The purpose of this analysis was to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two different management strategies for the 
timing of permanent pacemaker implantation for new heart block after valve 
surgery.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using costs and probabilities 
of short- and long-term complications of pacemaker placement, short-term 
atrioventricular node recovery, intensive care unit stays, and long-term 
follow-up. We aggregated the total expected cost and utility of each option over 
a 20-y period. Quality-adjusted survival with a pacemaker was estimated from the 
literature and institutional patient-reported outcomes. Primary decision 
analysis was based on an expected recovery rate of 36.7% at 12 d with timing of 
pacemaker implantation: early placement (5 d) versus watchful waiting for 12 d.
RESULTS: A strategy of watchful waiting was more costly ($171,798 ± $45,695 
versus $165,436 ± $52,923; P < 0.0001) but had a higher utility (9.05 ± 1.36 
versus 8.55 ± 1.33 quality-adjusted life years; P < 0.0001) than an early 
pacemaker implantation strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
watchful waiting was $12,724 per quality-adjusted life year. The results are 
sensitive to differences in quality-adjusted survival and rates of recovery of 
atrioventricular node function.
CONCLUSIONS: Watchful waiting for pacemaker insertion is a cost-effective 
management strategy compared with early placement for acute atrioventricular 
block after valve surgery. Although this is cost-effective from a population 
perspective, clinical risk scores predicting recovery will aid in personalized 
decision-making.

    Mol Psychiatry. 2021 Jan 4;:

Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with core features including 
hallucinations, delusions, and cognition deficits. Accumulating evidence has 
implicated abnormal DNA methylation in the development of schizophrenia. 
However, the mechanisms by which DNA methylation changes alter the risk for 
schizophrenia remain largely unknown. We recently carried out a DNA methylome 
study of peripheral blood samples from 469 first-episode patients with 
schizophrenia and 476 age- and gender-matched healthy controls of Han Chinese 
origin. Genomic DNA methylation patterns were quantified using an Illumina 
Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We identified multiple differentially 
methylated positions (DMPs) and regions between patients and controls. The most 
significant DMPs were annotated to genes C17orf53, THAP1 and KCNQ4 (KV7.4), with 
Bonferroni-adjusted P values of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and 
[Formula: see text], respectively. In particular, KCNQ4 encodes a voltage-gated 
potassium channel of the KV7 family, which is linked to neuronal excitability. 
The genes associated with top-ranked DMPs also included many genes involved in 
nervous system development, such as LIMK2 and TMOD2. Gene ontology analysis of 
the differentially methylated genes further identified strong enrichment of 
neuronal networks, including neuron projection extension, axonogenesis and 
neuron apoptotic process. Finally, we provided evidence that 
schizophrenia-associated epigenetic alterations co-localize with genetic 
susceptibility loci. By focusing on first-episode schizophrenia patients, our 
investigation lends particularly strong support for an important role of DNA 
methylation in schizophrenia pathogenesis unconfounded by the effects of 
long-term antipsychotic medication or disease progression. The observed DNA 
methylation aberrations in schizophrenia patients could potentially provide a 
valuable resource for identifying diagnostic biomarkers and developing novel 
therapeutic targets to benefit schizophrenia patients.

According to the World Health Organization, human life expectancy has increased 
significantly around the world over the past century, but this process is 
inevitably accompanied by aging. Therefore, persons who have reached the elderly 
and senile age often become infirm, especially physically. As a result, such 
people find it increasingly difficult to make movements related to self-service 
and movement when using standard clothing and shoes. In a study of 55 patients 
(from 60 to 87 years), conducted for the first time from the point of view of 
medical and social rehabilitation, data were obtained that reveal the nature of 
physical limitations of this group of people, which significantly complicate 
them use of standard clothing and shoes. The main conclusion of the work is the 
relevance of the development of medical and technical requirements for the 
design and production of clothing and footwear specifically for the elderly and 
senile taking into account their changed anthropometric parameters and their 
characteristic functional limitations.

Publisher: По данным ВОЗ, за последнее столетие продолжительность жизни человека 
значительно увеличилась во всем мире, но этот процесс неизбежно сопровождается 
старением. Поэтому лица, достигшие пожилого и старческого возраста, нередко 
становятся немощными, особенно в физическом плане. В итоге, таким людям всё 
труднее даются движения, связанные с самообслуживанием и передвижением, при 
пользовании типовой одеждой и обувью. В процессе обследования 55 пациентов 60–87 
лет, проведённого впервые с позиций медико-социальной реабилитации, получены 
данные о характере ограничений физических возможностей этого контингента людей, 
существенно осложняющих использование ими типовой одежды и обуви. Основной вывод 
работы заключается в актуальности разработки медико-технических требований, 
предъявляемых к проектированию и производству одежды и обуви специально для 
данной категории людей с учетом их измененных антропометрических параметров и 
характерных для них функциональных ограничений.

Edible films and coatings are eco-friendly promising materials for preserving 
the quality and extending the shelf life of fresh and minimally-processed 
fruits. They can form protective layers around fruits, regulate their 
respiration rates, and protect them from loss of water, tissue softening, 
browning, and microbial contamination. Edible films and coatings have many 
advantages over other post-harvest treatments. They can add commercial value to 
fruits by enhancing their appearance, and act as carriers of functional 
ingredients, such as antioxidants, antimicrobial agents and nutraceuticals. 
Mango, a highly perishable tropical fruit, has a short post-harvest life, which 
limits transport to distant markets. Application of edible films and coatings on 
mango fruits is an effective method to preserve their quality and safety. This 
paper provides an overview of desirable properties for films and coatings, and 
recent development in different edible coatings for both fresh and 
minimally-processed mango. The most popular edible coating materials, such as 
chitosan, waxes, starch, gums, and cellulose used for mango are reviewed. The 
commercialization of coating formulations and equipment used for application of 
coatings are discussed. The environmental impacts, safety aspects, and the 
challenges encountered are outlined. The opportunities to use other coating 
materials, such as aloe-vera gel, microbial polysaccharides, and photosynthetic 
microorganisms are also examined.

BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that catheter ablation 
for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction may improve survival and other cardiovascular outcomes.
METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to estimate the costs 
and benefits of catheter ablation and medical management in patients with 
symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular 
ejection fraction ≤35%) and atrial fibrillation over a lifetime horizon. 
Evidence from the published literature informed the model inputs, including 
clinical effectiveness data from meta-analyses. Probabilistic and deterministic 
sensitivity analyses were performed. A 3% discount rate was applied to both 
future costs and benefits. The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio assessed from the US health care sector perspective.
RESULTS: Catheter ablation was associated with 6.47 (95% CI, 5.89-6.93) 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a total cost of $105 657 (95% CI, 
$55 311-$191 934; 2018 US dollars), compared with 5.30 (95% CI, 5.20-5.39) QALYs 
and $63 040 (95% CI, $37 624-$102 260) for medical management. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for catheter ablation compared with medical management 
was $38 496 (95% CI, $5583-$117 510) per QALY gained. Model inputs with the 
greatest variation on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates were the 
cost of ablation and the effect of catheter ablation on mortality reduction. 
When assuming a more conservative estimate of the treatment effect of catheter 
ablation on mortality (hazard ratio of 0.86), the estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $74 403 per QALY gained. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained, atrial fibrillation ablation was found to 
be economically favorable compared with medical management in 95% of 
simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation in patients with heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction patients and atrial fibrillation may be considered 
economically attractive at current benchmarks for societal willingness-to-pay in 
the United States.

The discovery of antibiotics was one of the fundamental stages in the 
development of humanity, leading to a dramatic increase in the life expectancy 
of millions of people all over the world. The uncontrolled use of antibiotics 
resulted in the selection of resistant strains of bacteria, limiting the 
effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy nowadays. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
were considered promising candidates for next-generation antibiotics for a long 
time. However, the practical application of AMPs is restricted by their low 
therapeutic indices, impaired pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, which is 
predetermined by their peptide structure. Nevertheless, the DNA-encoded nature 
of AMPs enables creating broad repertoires of artificial biodiversity of 
antibiotics, making them versatile templates for the directed evolution of 
antibiotic activity. Lantibiotics are a unique class of AMPs with an expanded 
chemical space. A variety of post-translational modifications, mechanisms of 
action on bacterial membranes, and DNA-encoded nature make them a convenient 
molecular template for creating highly representative libraries of antimicrobial 
compounds. Isolation of new drug candidates from this synthetic biodiversity is 
extremely attractive but requires high-throughput screening of antibiotic 
activity. The combination of synthetic biology and ultrahigh-throughput 
microfluidics allows implementing the concept of directed evolution of 
lantibiotics for accelerated creation of new promising drug candidates.

Diagnosis and Image-guided Therapy of Cardiac Left Ventricular Assist Device 
Infections.

Due to limited availability of donor hearts, more and more end stage heart 
failure patients are dependent on left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as their 
destination therapy rather than the original intended use as a bridge for heart 
transplantation. While LVADs improve life expectancy in these patients, 
infection emerges as one of the major adverse events. Early and accurate 
localization of LVAD infection is critical, as it can significantly influence 
clinical management decisions and ultimately impact patient outcome. Although 
the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation has defined 3 
categories for LVAD infection: (1) LVAD-specific infection, (2) LVAD-related 
infection, and (3) non-LVAD infection, there is still lack of standardized 
criteria for diagnosing these 3 types of LVAD infections. Morphologically based 
imaging tools such as transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac computed 
tomography (CT) or CT angiogram have limited roles in diagnosing LVAD infections 
due to their nonspecific findings, often affected by significant streaking and 
beam hardening artifacts from the metal device. In contrast, 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT has 
repeatedly shown a high sensitivity and specificity for LVAD infection 
diagnosis, albeit in small number of subjects. Beyond its accuracy for detecting 
infection, FDG PET/CT can predict clinical outcome based on the location of LVAD 
infection. As a functional imaging tool, FDG PET/CT can demonstrate the extent 
and severity of LVAD infection, as well as infectious embolism and potential 
extra-cardiac source of infection, which are all critical for providing optimal 
patient care, justifying its judicious and precise use in the workup of LVAD 
infection.

Dysdercus koenigii, a serious cotton-staining insect pest in many countries, has 
shown high resistance to imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide used 
to control sap-sucking pests. With the aim of creating an effective management 
strategy, the biological traits of susceptible (SS) and imidacloprid-resistant 
(Imida-RS) D. koenigii, as well as their reciprocal crosses (CR1 and CR2), were 
investigated here using a life table established on age, stage, and two-sex 
patterns. Compared with SS D. koenigii, Imida-RS and CR1 strains had lower 
relative fitness (0.80 and 0.47, respectively) and fecundity (eggs per female); 
prolonged egg duration and a prolonged adult preoviposition period; shorter 
nymphal duration, male/female total longevity, and oviposition days, and a 
shorter total preoviposition period. However, there were no differences among 
strains in nymphal survival rates and female ratio. The CR2 D. koenigii had 
similar relative fitness value (1.09), suggested no fitness cost in most of the 
parameters. Demographic parameters, including net reproductive rate, were lower 
in the Imida-RS strain than in SS and CR2 D. koenigii. Similarly, the Imida-RS 
and CR1 strains had shorter generation time and doubling time, lower 
reproductive value and life expectancy relative to the SS and CR2 D. koenigii. 
In addition, age-specific fecundity was negatively affected in the CR1 strain 
compared with the other strains. These findings could help facilitate the 
development of rational D. koenigii control strategies.

A model for the incremental burden of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b due 
to a decline of childhood vaccination during the COVID-19 outbreak: A dynamic

BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused 
a persistent decline in childhood vaccination coverage, including Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, in some countries. Our objective was to 
evaluate the impact of decreased Hib vaccination due to COVID-19 on invasive Hib 
disease burden in Japan.
METHODS: Using a deterministic dynamic transmission model 
(susceptible-carriage-infection-recovery model), the incidence rates of invasive 
Hib disease in under 5 year olds in rapid vaccination recovery and persistent 
vaccination declined scenarios were compared for the next 10 years after 2020. 
The national Hib vaccination rate after the impact of COVID-19 reduced to 87% 
and 73% in 2020 from approximately 97% each in 2013-2019 for primary and booster 
doses.
RESULTS: While the persistent decline scenarios revealed an increase in invasive 
Hib disease incidence to 0.50/100,000 children under 5 years old, the incidence 
of the rapid recovery scenario slightly increased with a consistent decline of 
incidence after 2021. The shorter the duration of the decline in vaccination 
rate was, the smaller the incremental disease burden observed in the model. 
Compared to the rapid recovery scenario, the permanent decline scenario showed a 
296.87 cumulative incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss for the 
next 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 
causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib 
transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures. A rapid recovery of 
vaccination coverage rate can prevent this possible incremental disease burden.

PURPOSE: To estimate health and economic outcomes associated with newborn 
screening (NBS) for infantile-onset Pompe disease in the United States.
METHODS: A decision analytic microsimulation model simulated health and economic 
outcomes of a birth cohort of 4 million children in the United States. Universal 
NBS and treatment was compared with clinical identification and treatment of 
infantile-onset Pompe disease. Main outcomes were projected cases identified, 
costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) over the life course.
RESULTS: Universal NBS for Pompe disease and confirmatory testing was estimated 
to cost an additional $26 million annually. Additional medication costs 
associated with earlier treatment initiation were $181 million; however, $8 
million in medical care costs for other services were averted due to delayed 
disease progression. Infants with screened and treated infantile-onset Pompe 
disease experienced an average lifetime increase of 11.66 QALYs compared with 
clinical detection. The ICER was $379,000/QALY from a societal perspective 
and $408,000/QALY from the health-care perspective. Results were sensitive to 
the cost of enzyme replacement therapy.
CONCLUSION: Newborn screening for Pompe disease results in substantial health 
gains for individuals with infantile-onset Pompe disease, but with additional 
costs.
