INTRODUCTION: Fear of childbirth is a well-known problem during pregnancy and 
can have implications for childbirth, including prolonged labor, use of epidural 
analgesia, obstetric complications, presence of traumatic stress symptoms, or 
request for an elective cesarean section. The coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic has affected mental health and therefore could have 
increased fear of childbirth during the pandemic. The aim of this study was to 
investigate fear of childbirth during the pandemic in the Netherlands compared 
with a reference group from before the pandemic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate pregnant 
women during the first and second waves of COVID-19 compared with both each 
other and with pregnant women from before the pandemic. Participants were 
recruited through social media platforms, hospitals, and midwifery practices. 
Pregnant women aged ≥18 years who had mastered the Dutch language were eligible 
to participate. Fear of childbirth was measured with the Wijma Delivery 
Expectancy Questionnaire online using a cut-off score of ≥85 to indicate 
clinically relevant fear of childbirth. The primary outcome was the prevalence 
of fear of childbirth. We undertook additional analyses to specifically look at 
possible effect modification.
RESULTS: In total, 1102 pregnant women completed the questionnaire during the 
first wave of the pandemic, 731 during the second wave, and 364 before the 
pandemic. Fear of childbirth was present in 10.6%, 11.4%, and 18.4%, 
respectively. We considered possible effect modification, which indicated that 
age and parity had a significant influence. In participants during the first 
wave of COVID-19, nulliparous women had significantly lower odds (odds ratio 
[OR] 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.73; p < 0.01) of having a fear of 
childbirth than did the reference group. Both younger participants in the first 
wave (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.37-0.93; p < 0.05) and older participants in the first 
wave (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.28-0.71; p < 0.01) and the second wave (OR 0.36; 95% CI 
0.21-0.62; p < 0.01) of COVID-19 had lower odds of fear of childbirth than the 
reference group.
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women during the first and second waves of COVID-19 had 
lower fear of childbirth scores than pregnant women before the pandemic, 
indicating less fear of childbirth during the pandemic. This could be explained 
by an increased level of information, more time to consume information, and 
better work-life balance with more people working at home during the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: A dose-response and nonlinear association between fruit and 
vegetable intake and mortality has been reported in Europe and the United 
States, but little is known about this association in Asia.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association of fruit and vegetable 
intake with all-cause, cancer, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease mortality 
in a Japanese cohort.
METHODS: In the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study, we included 
94,658 participants (mean age: 56.4; 46.0% male) without cancer and 
cardiovascular disease at baseline. Information on fruit and vegetable intake 
was collected using a validated FFQ. The Cox proportional hazard model was used 
to estimate HRs and 95% CIs of each quintile of fruit and vegetable intake, 
separately, in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality using the 
first quintile as a reference. Nonlinear associations were evaluated using a 
likelihood ratio test, comparing a linear model with a restricted cubic spline 
model.
RESULTS: During a median of 20.9 follow-up years (IQR: 19.6-23.8 y), 23,687 
all-cause deaths were documented. After adjusting for age, sex, and potential 
confounding factors, fruit and vegetable intake was nonlinearly and 
significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality, with the fourth and 
fifth quintiles having comparable HRs (fruit: fourth quintile HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 
0.87, 0.95 and fifth quintile HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.96; P-nonlinearity 
< 0.001; vegetable: fourth quintile HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.97 and fifth 
quintile HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.98; P-nonlinearity = 0.002). Fruit intake was 
significantly associated with lower cardiovascular mortality (HR in the fifth 
quintile: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99; P-nonlinearity = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In the Japanese population, higher intake of fruits and vegetables 
was nonlinearly associated with decreased all-cause mortality. These findings 
may contribute to the establishment of dietary recommendations for enhancing 
life expectancy in Asia.

BACKGROUND: Whilst there is a substantial body of evidence on the costs and 
benefits of smoking cessation generally, the benefits of routinely providing 
smoking cessation for surgical populations are less well known. This review 
summarises the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of preoperative smoking 
cessation to prevent surgical complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the Cochrane, Econlit, EMBASE, Health 
Technology Assessment, Medline Complete and Scopus databases was conducted from 
inception until June 23, 2021. Peer-reviewed, English-language articles 
describing economic evaluations of preoperative smoking cessation interventions 
to prevent surgical complications were included. Search results were 
independently screened for potentially eligible studies. Study characteristics, 
economic evaluation methods and cost-effectiveness results were extracted by one 
reviewer and details checked by a second. Two authors independently assessed 
reporting and methodological quality using the Consolidated Health Economic 
Evaluation Reporting Standards statement (CHEERS) and the Quality of Health 
Economic Studies Instrument checklist (QHES) respectively.
RESULTS: After removing duplicates, twenty full text articles were screened from 
1423 database records, resulting in six included economic evaluations. Studies 
from the United States (n = 4), France (n = 1) and Spain (n = 1) were reported 
between 2009 and 2020. Four evaluations were conducted from a payer perspective. 
Two-thirds of evaluations were well-conducted (mean score 83) and well-reported 
(on average, 86% items reported). All studies concluded preoperative smoking 
cessation is cost-effective for preventing surgical complications; results 
ranged from cost saving to €53,131 per quality adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative smoking cessation is cost-effective for preventing 
surgical complications from a payer or provider perspective when compared to 
standard care. There is no evidence from outside the United States and Europe to 
inform healthcare providers, funders and policy-makers in other jurisdictions 
and more information is needed to clarify the optimal point of implementation to 
maximise cost-effectiveness of preoperative smoking cessation intervention.

The repeated, rapid and often pronounced patterns of evolutionary divergence 
observed in insular plants, or the 'plant island syndrome', include changes in 
leaf phenotypes, growth, as well as the acquisition of a perennial lifestyle. 
Here, we sequence and describe the genome of the critically endangered, 
Galápagos-endemic species Scalesia atractyloides Arnot., obtaining a 
chromosome-resolved, 3.2-Gbp assembly containing 43,093 candidate gene models. 
Using a combination of fossil transposable elements, k-mer spectra analyses and 
orthologue assignment, we identify the two ancestral genomes, and date their 
divergence and the polyploidization event, concluding that the ancestor of all 
extant Scalesia species was an allotetraploid. There are a comparable number of 
genes and transposable elements across the two subgenomes, and while their 
synteny has been mostly conserved, we find multiple inversions that may have 
facilitated adaptation. We identify clear signatures of selection across genes 
associated with vascular development, growth, adaptation to salinity and 
flowering time, thus finding compelling evidence for a genomic basis of the 
island syndrome in one of Darwin's giant daisies.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, declining mortality, and birth 
rates, the world's geriatric population is increasing. Falls in the older people 
are one of the most common and serious problems. Injuries from falls can be 
fatal or non-fatal and physical or psychological, leading to a reduction in the 
ability to perform activities of daily living. The aim of this study was to 
determine the prevalence of falls in the older people through systematic review 
and meta-analysis.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the data from studies on 
the prevalence of falls in the older people in the world were extracted in the 
databases of Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), PubMed and Science Direct, and Google 
Scholar, Magiran and Scientific Information Database (SID) without any time 
limit until August 2020. To analyze the eligible studies, the stochastic effects 
model was used, and the heterogeneity of the studies with the I2 index was 
investigated. Data analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 
software (Version 2).
RESULTS: In the review of 104 studies with a total sample size of 36,740,590, 
the prevalence of falls in the older people of the world was 26.5% (95% CI 
23.4-29.8%). The highest rate of prevalence of falls in the older people was 
related to Oceania with 34.4% (95% CI 29.2-40%) and America with 27.9% (95% CI 
22.4-34.2%). The results of meta-regression indicated a decreasing trend in the 
prevalence of falls in the older people of the world by increasing the sample 
size and increasing the research year (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The problem of falls, as a common problem with harmful consequences, 
needs to be seriously considered by policymakers and health care providers to 
make appropriate plans for preventive interventions to reduce the rate of falls 
in the older people.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of voretigene neparvovec 
(VN) compared with standard of care (SoC) for patients with inherited retinal 
disease (IRD) caused by a biallelic RPE65-mutation. VN is a live, 
non-replicating adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2). SoC is best supportive 
care provided to patients with visual impairment. Patients under SoC may 
experience progressive vision loss leading to complete blindness.
METHODS: We adapted a previously published Markov cohort model for IRD. An 
annual cycle length, life-long time horizon, discount rate of 3% for cost and 
health outcomes, and Swiss health system perspective were used. Data from a 
randomised controlled phase III trial of VN versus SoC (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT00999609) were used to estimate transitions between health states in the 
first year, after which VN patients were assumed to remain for 39 subsequent 
years in the health state they were in at the end of the first year. After the 
40th year for VN patients and 1st year for SoC patients, visual decline was 
modelled based on observational data on the natural progression of the disease. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated based on an external study 
which elicited clinicians' EQ-5D-5L-based utility estimates for IRD patients 
with a RPE65-mutation. Costs (Swiss Francs (CHF), year 2018-2019) included drug 
acquisition/ administration, adverse events, testing for sufficient viable 
retinal cells, and healthcare-related costs of blindness. Societal costs of 
blindness were added in a complementary analysis. Robustness of the model 
results were tested in sensitivity and scenario analyses.
RESULTS: For the base-case, VN resulted in incremental costs per patient of CHF 
764'402 (VN: CHF 901'654, SoC: CHF 137'252), incremental blindness-free years of 
7.67 (VN: 28.32, SoC: 20.65) and incremental QALYs of 6.73 (VN: 18.35, SoC: 
11.62), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 113'526 per 
QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost-effectiveness of VN 
was better than CHF 100,000 per QALY gained in 41% of iterations. For the 
scenario analysis in which a societal perspective was adopted and for which a 
50% work-related productivity loss from blindness was assumed, incremental costs 
of CHF 423,837 and an ICER of CHF 62'947 per QALY gained were produced. The 
scenario assuming VN treatment effect lasts for 20 years produced an ICER of CHF 
156'171 per QALY gained, whereas assuming a life-long VN treatment effect 
resulted in an ICER of CHF 96'384 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of VN compared to the SoC 
was estimated to be CHF 113'526 and CHF 62'947 per QALY gained, respectively, 
from a Swiss healthcare system, and societal perspective assuming a 50% 
productivity loss.

Sporulation: A response to starvation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces 
pombe.

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe employs two main strategies to adapt 
to the environment and survive when starved for nutrients. The strategies employ 
sporulation via sexual differentiation and extension of the chronological 
lifespan. When a cell is exposed to nutrient starvation in the presence of a 
cell of the opposite sex, the cells undergo fusion through conjugation and 
sporulation through meiosis. S. pombe spores are highly resistant to diverse 
stresses and may survive for a very long time. In this minireview, among the 
various sexual differentiation processes induced by starvation, we focused on 
and summarized the findings of the molecular mechanisms of spore formation in 
fission yeast. Furthermore, comparative measurements of the chronological 
lifespan of stationary phase cells and G0 cells and the survival period of spore 
cells revealed that the spore cells survived for a long period, indicating the 
presence of an effective mechanism for survival. Currently, many molecules 
involved in sporulation and their functions are being discovered; however, our 
understanding of these is not complete. Further understanding of spores may not 
only deepen our comprehension of sexual differentiation but may also provide 
hints for sustaining life.

A mini-review of end-of-life management of wind turbines: Current practices and 
closing the circular economy gap.

and Education, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia.

Renewable energy generation and increased electrification are pivotal to 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Consequently, 
global deployment of wind turbines has soared, and the trend is expected to 
continue. Installed turbines have only recently started reaching the end of 
their design lives, and waste volumes are projected to escalate rapidly. 
Approximately 94% of a wind turbine (by mass) is recyclable, but the waste 
polymer composite blades are most commonly landfilled. This mini-review aims to 
review current end-of-life (EoL) management practices in the large-scale wind 
industry for countries with established EoL standards as well as those with less 
mature regulations. Data on current EoL management practices, initiatives and 
regulations in industry was sourced primarily from literature reviews and 
publicly available internet information. Additional insights and perspectives 
were gained from WindEurope's EoL Issues and Strategies 2020 seminar and through 
communication with select individuals from various sectors such as wind energy 
development and operations, government, industry associations, academia and 
research organizations. The results show that the decision on EoL options is 
dictated by the remaining useful life (RUL) of the wind turbines, prevailing 
policies and electricity prices. The contribution of this article is, firstly, 
identifying a number of key technical, economic and regulatory questions that 
must be asked before deciding on the most appropriate EoL option. Secondly, the 
article identifies factors that impede current EoL management efforts to close 
the circular economy gap and those that can support sustainable technology 
deployment. Finally, the article considers the way that countries with a young 
fleet of wind farms may learn from more experienced nations. There are few 
proven business cases, and barriers to the profitability and effectiveness of 
EoL strategies include uncertainty about the assets' RUL, collection logistics, 
the size of wind farm operation margins, low waste feedstock and limited markets 
for recycled products. Designing for circularity, stakeholder collaboration, 
circular business models and technology-specific regulations can improve EoL 
sustainability. The research found that wind turbine EoL management is dynamic 
and complex and needs to consider multiple, often conflicting factors. However, 
it is necessary and has immense environmental, technical and economic potential 
as the industry matures and business cases are proven.

Objectives: People living with HIV (PWH) have seen reduction in HIV-associated 
morbidity and increase in near-normal life expectancy, yet unhealthy alcohol use 
poses substantial risks to older as well as younger adults. Further research 
regarding age-associated physical and mental health concerns among PWH who drink 
alcohol is needed to inform services, given the expanding age range of patients 
in care.Methods: We compared age group differences (18-34, 35-44, 45-54, 
≥55 years old) in two-year patient-reported outcomes and HIV viral control among 
PWH enrolled in a primary care-based behavioral alcohol intervention trial; with 
90% follow up from baseline.Results: Of 553 PWH, 50 (9%) were 18-34, 85 (15%) 
were 35-44, 197 (36%) were 45-54, and 221 (40%) were ≥55 years old. Most were 
men (97%) and White (64%). At two years, PWH ≥55 reported less substance use in 
the prior 30 days, fewer social contacts, and more pain; younger PWH had lower 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. In adjusted analyses, PWH ages 18-34 had 
higher odds of unhealthy alcohol use, tobacco, cannabis, or other substances 
compared to those ≥55; with higher odds of anxiety among PWH 35-44 compared with 
those ≥55; and physical quality of life was worse among those ≥55 compared with 
younger groups.Conclusions: While older PWH report less substance use than 
younger PWH and have better ART adherence post-treatment, they are more likely 
to experience limited social support and worse physical quality of life. 
Findings can inform interventions to address varying needs of PWH across the 
lifespan.

Immunological mechanisms involved in the persistence of HIV reservoirs.

[Article in English]

Espinosa Ortiz A, Modica A, Fromentin R, Chomont N.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) controls viral replication and has dramatically 
improved the quality and life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV). 
However, almost 40 years after the discovery of HIV, there is still no cure; 
even after years of effective ART, the virus persists in cells, primarily memory 
CD4 T cells. These cells are a perennial source of infectious viruses, which 
necessitate that people living with HIV continue ART for life. Research on HIV 
reservoirs over the past 25 years has provided insight into how some infected 
cells persist for decades without being cleared by ART nor by immune responses. 
HIV "hides" in cells with extended lifespans, which have the capacity to 
proliferate through diverse mechanisms and which preferentially express several 
receptors that allow them to remain invisible to the immune system. A better 
understanding of these mechanisms of persistence is a necessary prerequisite for 
the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at eradicating HIV.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential years of life lost (PYLL) to cancer in the 
State of Mato Grosso, from 2000 to 2019, stratified by sex, according to age 
groups and cancer types.
METHODS: It is a quantitative study with an ecological approach developed from 
secondary data, using the PYLL and its derivatives.
RESULTS: In the period analyzed, deaths from cancer in Mato Grosso resulted in 
680,338 PYLL before the age of 80, with a variation of 82.5%. Of this total, 
52.7% were assigned to males. The rate of the PYLL for cancer before the age of 
60 was 70.9% in males, and 80.1% among women. The rates of PYLL increased in the 
period and showed slightly higher values in males. In the analysis according to 
age group, the rates of PYLL were also higher in males, except between the ages 
of 30 and 49. Lung cancers and lymphomas/leukemias resulted in greater losses of 
PYLL among men and female specific cancers (breast, cervical and uterine, and 
ovarian cancer) accounted for 36.26% of the PYLL among women, with variability 
per age groups.
CONCLUSION: In Mato Grosso, the PYLL indicator for cancer presented unfavorable 
evolution between 2000 and 2019, with greater damage for males and for the 
younger population. Leukemias, lymphomas, and lung and breast cancers were the 
main causes for the PYLL.

BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty around the health impact and economic costs of 
the recent slowing of the historical decline in cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
incidence and the future impact on dementia and disability.
METHODS: Previously validated IMPACT Better Ageing Markov model for England and 
Wales, integrating English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) data for 17,906 
ELSA participants followed from 1998 to 2012, linked to NHS Hospital Episode 
Statistics. Counterfactual design comparing two scenarios: Scenario 1. CVD 
Plateau-age-specific CVD incidence remains at 2011 levels, thus continuing 
recent trends. Scenario 2. CVD Fall-age-specific CVD incidence goes on 
declining, following longer-term trends. The main outcome measures were 
age-related healthcare costs, social care costs, opportunity costs of informal 
care, and quality adjusted life years (valued at £60,000 per QALY).
FINDINGS: The total 10 year cumulative incremental net monetary cost associated 
with a persistent plateauing of CVD would be approximately £54 billion (95% 
uncertainty interval £14.3-£96.2 billion), made up of some £13 billion 
(£8.8-£16.7 billion) healthcare costs, £1.5 billion (-£0.9-£4.0 billion) social 
care costs, £8 billion (£3.4-£12.8 billion) informal care and £32 billion 
(£0.3-£67.6 billion) value of lost QALYs.
INTERPRETATION: After previous, dramatic falls, CVD incidence has recently 
plateaued. That slowdown could substantially increase health and social care 
costs over the next ten years. Healthcare costs are likely to increase more than 
social care costs in absolute terms, but social care costs will increase more in 
relative terms. Given the links between COVID-19 and cardiovascular health, 
effective cardiovascular prevention policies need to be revitalised urgently.

INTRODUCTION: (Excess) mortality and years of life lost are important measures 
of health risks from the Corona pandemic. The aim of this paper was to identify 
methodological factors that affect the calculation of mortality and further to 
point out possible misinterpretations of years of life lost.
METHODOLOGY: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) can be used to compare 
mortalities (e. g., an SMR of 1.015 means excess mortality of 1.5%, an SMR of 
0.990 means that mortality is reduced by 1.0%). In this study, SMRs as a measure 
of association for mortality in Germany were calculated for 2020 using different 
methods. In particular, the influence of different data sources and reference 
periods was examined. Furthermore, its influence on the calculated mortality was 
also examined to take into account increasing life expectancy. In addition, 
published results on years of life lost were critically analyzed.
RESULTS: Using January 2022 data from the Federal Statistical Office on 
mortality for 5-year age groups resulted in higher SMR values than using 
preliminary data from February 2021 with 20-year age groups (SMR=0.997, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.995-0.999 versus SMR=0.976 (95% CI: 0.974-0.978)). 
The choice of the reference period had a large impact on calculated mortality 
(for men, SMR=1.024 (95% CI: 1.022-1.027) with 2019 as the reference year versus 
SMR=0.998 (95% CI: 0.996-1.001) with 2016 to 2019 as the reference period). 
Analyses in which declining mortality in 2016 to 2019 was carried forward into 
2020 when calculating expected deaths resulted in significantly higher SMR 
values (for men SMR=1.024 (95% CI: 1.021-1.026) with, and SMR=0.998 (95% CI: 
0.996-1.001) without carrying forward declining mortality). Figures for 
pandemic-related years of life lost per person who died from COVID-19 should be 
interpreted with caution: Calculation from remaining life reported in mortality 
tables can lead to misleading results.
CONCLUSION: When calculating mortality and years of life lost during the 
pandemic, a number of methodological assumptions must be made that have a 
significant impact on the results and must be considered when interpreting the 
results.

Publisher: EINLEITUNG: (Über)sterblichkeit und verlorene Lebensjahre sind 
wichtige Maße für gesundheitliche Risiken durch die Corona-Pandemie. Das Ziel 
dieses Beitrags ist es, methodische Faktoren zu benennen, die die Berechnung der 
Sterblichkeit beeinflussen, und auf mögliche Fehlinterpretationen von verlorenen 
Lebensjahren hinzuweisen.
METHODIK: Standardisierte Mortalitätsratios (SMRs) können für den Vergleich von 
Sterblichkeiten verwendet werden (z. B. bedeutet ein SMR von 1,015 eine 
Übersterblichkeit von 1,5%, ein SMR von 0,990 eine Untersterblichkeit von 1,0%). 
In dieser Studie werden SMRs als Assoziationsmaße für die Sterblichkeit in 
Deutschland mit unterschiedlicher Methodik für das Jahr 2020 berechnet. 
Insbesondere wird der Einfluss unterschiedlicher Datenquellen und 
Referenzperioden untersucht. Ferner wird geprüft, welchen Einfluss es auf die 
berechnete Sterblichkeit hat, die steigende Lebenserwartung zu berücksichtigen. 
Darüber hinaus werden publizierte Ergebnisse zu verlorenen Lebensjahren kritisch 
diskutiert.
ERGEBNISSE: Die Nutzung aktueller Daten des Statistischen Bundesamts vom Januar 
2022, in denen die Sterblichkeit für 5-Jahres-Altersgruppen berichtet wird, 
führt zu höheren SMR-Werten als die Nutzung vorläufiger Daten vom Februar 2021 
mit 20-Jahres-Altersklassen (SMR=0,997, 95% Konfidenzintervall (KI): 0,995–0,999 
versus SMR=0,976 (95% KI: 0,974–0,978)). Die Wahl des Referenzzeitraums hat 
großen Einfluss auf die berechnete Sterblichkeit (für Männer: SMR=1,024 (95% KI: 
1,022–1,027) mit 2019 als Referenzjahr versus SMR=0,998 (95% KI: 0,996–1,001) 
mit 2016 bis 2019 als Referenzzeitraum). Analysen, in denen bei der Berechnung 
erwarteter Sterbefälle die sinkende Mortalität in den Jahren 2016 bis 2019 in 
das Jahr 2020 fortgeschrieben wird, führen zu deutlich höheren SMR-Werten (für 
Männer SMR=1,024 (95% KI: 1,021–1,026) mit, und SMR=0,998 (95% KI: 0,996–1,001) 
ohne Fortschreibung der sinkenden Mortalität). Zahlen zu pandemiebedingten 
verlorenen Lebensjahren pro an COVID-19 Verstorbenem sind mit Vorsicht zu 
interpretieren: Eine Berechnung aus der in Sterbetafeln angegebenen 
verbleibenden Lebenszeit führt zu irreführenden Ergebnissen.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Bei Berechnung zur Sterblichkeit und zu verlorenen 
Lebensjahren während der Pandemie sind eine Reihe methodischer Annahmen zu 
treffen, die erheblichen Einfluss auf die Ergebnisse haben und bei der 
Interpretation der Ergebnisse beachtet werden müssen.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or 
function, present for ˃3 months, with implications for health. The most used 
diagnostic criteria are a urinary albumin: creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g or an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Either of these 
diagnostic thresholds is associated with adverse health outcomes. GFR decreases 
with age and the prevalence of CKD is highest in older adults; moreover, the 
presence of CKD is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and 
cardiovascular death related to accelerated ageing in all age ranges, and the 
absolute increase in risk is highest for those aged ˃75 years. Indeed, premature 
death is a more common outcome than CKD progression to kidney failure requiring 
kidney replacement therapy. The progressive ageing of the world population 
contributes to the projection that CKD will become the second most common cause 
of death before the end of the century in countries with long life expectancy. 
The current collection of selected studies on kidney disease and ageing 
published in Age&Ageing, NDT and CKJ provides an overview of key topics, 
including cognitive decline, sarcopaenia, wasting and cardiovascular and 
non-cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the management of kidney failure and 
gender differences in CKD progression.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the global burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, as 
well as the five common conditions, and their relevant risk factors from 1990 to 
2019.
DESIGN: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 were used in this 
study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Individuals of all ages and genders from 204 countries 
and territories in 21 regions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes were the numbers and age-standardised rates 
(ASRs) of incident cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of 
MSK disorders. The average annual percent changes (AAPCs) in the ASRs were 
calculated using joinpoint regression analysis to estimate the trends.
RESULTS: There were 322.75 million incident cases, 117.54 thousand deaths and 
150.08 million DALYs of MSK disorders in 2019. The age-standardised incidence 
rate and age-standardised DALY rate in 2019 (incidence: AAPC=-0.32, 95% CI -0.34 
to -0.31; DALYs: AAPC=-0.05, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.04) were lower than those in 
1990. However, the age-standardised death rate showed a stable trend (AAPC 0.05, 
95% CI -0.05 to 0.15) from 1990 to 2019. The peak age of onset and DALYs of MSK 
disorders was 50-54 years in 2019. The burden of MSK disorders in females was 
much higher than that in males (1.29 times more incident cases, 2.24 times more 
deaths and 1.45 times more DALYs in females than in males). A significant 
negative correlation was observed between the AAPCs in the ASRs and the 
Sociodemographic Index (SDI) score. Occupational risk exhibited the highest 
contribution to MSK disorders, and tobacco use and high body mass index were 
also major risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the burden of MSK disorders tends to 
be lower in high-SDI regions than in lower-SDI regions. Strengthening the 
effectiveness of preventive measures against occupational risks may reduce the 
burden of MSK disorders.

Avoidance of sunlight and self-restraint due to the COVID-19 pandemic may 
contribute to reduced vitamin D status. This study provides comparable data on 
vitamin D status in Japanese young women and assesses the effect of lifestyle, 
including changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on vitamin D status. In study 
1, 39 young healthy Japanese women aged 21-25 y were recruited from May 
2016-June 2017. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration and diet and 
lifestyle information were obtained from participants each month (n=124). In 
study 2, using the same parameters as study 1, young women aged 21-23 y (n=10) 
were recruited in September 2020. In the results of study 1, we found the 
frequencies of vitamin D deficiency (25OHD<20 ng/mL) in spring, summer, fall, 
and winter were 90.5%, 62.5%, 81.5%, and 91.3%, respectively. The substantial 
difference of serum 25OHD concentration was obtained in spring (Δ3.6 ng/mL) and 
summer (Δ5.1 ng/mL) depending on the frequency of sunscreen use (0-2 d/wk, 3-7 
d/wk). In study 2, serum 25OHD concentration in September 2020 was extremely 
lower than in September 2016 (13.2 ng/mL vs. 21.7 ng/mL). The number of days 
spent outside in 2020 decreased drastically compared with 2019. In conclusion, 
vitamin D deficiency was highly common in Japanese women in their early 20s, and 
frequent sunscreen use contributed to low vitamin D status. Moreover, because 
the decrease in days outside due to the COVID-19 pandemic obviously resulted in 
a decline in vitamin D status, both appropriate sunbathing and increased dietary 
vitamin D intake are recommended to young women.
