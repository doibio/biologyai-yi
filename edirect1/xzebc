DNA polymerases catalyze DNA synthesis with high efficiency, which is essential 
for all life. Extensive kinetic and structural efforts have been executed in 
exploring mechanisms of DNA polymerases, surrounding their kinetic pathway, 
catalytic mechanisms, and factors that dictate polymerase fidelity. Recent 
time-resolved crystallography studies on DNA polymerase η (Pol η) and β have 
revealed essential transient events during the DNA synthesis reaction, such as 
mechanisms of primer deprotonation, separated roles of the three metal ions, and 
conformational changes that disfavor incorporation of the incorrect substrate. 
DNA-embedded ribonucleotides (rNs) are the most common lesion on DNA and a major 
threat to genome integrity. While kinetics of rN incorporation has been explored 
and structural studies have revealed that DNA polymerases have a steric gate 
that destabilizes ribonucleotide triphosphate binding, the mechanism of 
extension upon rN addition remains poorly characterized. Using steady-state 
kinetics, static and time-resolved X-ray crystallography with Pol η as a model 
system, we showed that the extra hydroxyl group on the primer terminus does 
alter the dynamics of the polymerase active site as well as the catalysis and 
fidelity of DNA synthesis. During rN extension, Pol η error incorporation 
efficiency increases significantly across different sequence contexts. Finally, 
our systematic structural studies suggest that the rN at the primer end improves 
primer alignment and reduces barriers in C2'-endo to C3'-endo sugar 
conformational change. Overall, our work provides further mechanistic insights 
into the effects of rN incorporation on DNA synthesis.

Simulation of Alcohol Control Policies for Health Equity (SIMAH) Project: Study 
Design and First Results.

Probst C, Buckley C, Lasserre AM, Kerr WC, Mulia N, Puka K, Purshouse RC, Ye Y, 
Rehm J.

Since about 2010, life expectancy at birth in the United States has stagnated 
and begun to decline, with concurrent increases in the socioeconomic divide in 
life expectancy. The Simulation of Alcohol Control Policies for Health Equity 
(SIMAH) Project uses a novel microsimulation approach to investigate the extent 
to which alcohol use, socioeconomic status (SES), and race/ethnicity contribute 
to unequal developments in US life expectancy and how alcohol control 
interventions could reduce such inequalities. Representative, secondary data 
from several sources will be integrated into one coherent, dynamic 
microsimulation to model life-course changes in SES and alcohol use and 
cause-specific mortality attributable to alcohol use by SES, race/ethnicity, 
age, and sex. Markov models will be used to inform transition intensities 
between levels of SES and drinking patterns. The model will be used to compare a 
baseline scenario with multiple counterfactual intervention scenarios. The 
preliminary results indicate that the crucial microsimulation component provides 
a good fit to observed demographic changes in the population, providing a robust 
baseline model for further simulation work. By demonstrating the feasibility of 
this novel approach, the SIMAH Project promises to offer superior integration of 
relevant empirical evidence to inform public health policy for a more equitable 
future.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of early CT coronary angiography 
(CTCA) for intermediate risk patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS), compared with standard care METHODS: We performed within-trial economic 
analysis using data from the RAPID-CTCA randomised trial, and long-term 
modelling of cost-effectiveness using secondary data sources to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of early CTCA compared with standard care for patients with 
suspected ACS attending acute hospitals in the UK. Cost-effectiveness was 
estimated as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, 
and the probability of each strategy being cost-effective at varying 
willingness-to-pay per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The within-trial analysis showed that there were no demonstrable 
differences in costs or QALYs between early CTCA and standard care, with point 
estimates suggesting higher costs (£7414 vs £6845: mean difference £569, 95% CI 
-£208 to £1335; p=0.1521) and lower QALYs (0.749 vs 0.758, mean difference 
-0.009, 95% CI -0.026 to 0.010; p=0.377) in the CTCA arm. The long-term economic 
analysis suggested that, on average, CTCA was slightly less effective than 
standard care alone with 0.025 quality-adjusted life years lost per patient 
treated and was more expensive with additional costs of £481 per patient 
treated. At a threshold of £20 000 per QALY, CTCA has 24% probability of being 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no demonstrable differences in within-trial costs and 
QALYs, and long-term cost-effectiveness modelling suggested higher long-term 
costs with CTCA and uncertain effect on long-term QALYs, making routine use of 
CTCA for suspected ACS unlikely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.

This study examined the adaptation level of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) 
practices among the farmers and the factors influencing the adoption of CSA 
practices in the Fujian Province, China. In this study, questionnaire survey 
data was analyzed, and 600 respondents were randomly selected as sample through 
randomly sampling technique. Descriptive statistics, adoption level index (ALI), 
and binary logit model were used for data analyses. These results indicated a 
moderate adoption level of CSA practices in the Fujian Province. Use of improved 
varieties, conservation tillage, fallow cropping, new technology, and 
intercropping were prevalent CSA practices among the farmers in the study area. 
In addition, farmers were not very interested in using herbicides on their 
farmlands, and only 20% of the respondents used herbicides in the Fujian 
Province. Except for Nindge village in the Fujian Province, all other studied 
villages have adapted to using organic fertilizer (around 50% of total 
respondents). However, more than 60% of respondents have claimed they still use 
chemical weed/insect/disease control in their farmlands. Age and working 
experience of farmers were the most influencing factors affecting the increase 
in the adoption of CSA practices among the farmers, and to the results of the 
binary logit model, education was not significant. Landholding, loan access, and 
access to agricultural extensions and organizations considerably impacted the 
adoption level of CSA practices among the farmers in the Fujian Province. 
Finally, this study will be helpful to decision-makers to make appropriate 
decisions to minimize the impact of climate change on agriculture and improve 
the standard of human life and food security.

AIM: We aimed to combine Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study data and local 
data to identify the highest priority intervention domains for preventing 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the case study country of Aotearoa New Zealand 
(NZ).
METHODS: Risk factor data for CVD in NZ were extracted from the GBD using the 
"GBD Results Tool." We prioritized risk factor domains based on consideration of 
the size of the health burden (disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) and then 
by the domain-specific interventions that delivered the highest health gains and 
cost-savings.
RESULTS: Based on the size of the CVD health burden in DALYs, the five top 
prioritized risk factor domains were: high systolic blood pressure (84,800 
DALYs; 5400 deaths in 2019), then dietary risk factors, then high LDL 
cholesterol, then high BMI and then tobacco (30,400 DALYs; 1400 deaths). But if 
policy-makers aimed to maximize health gain and cost-savings from specific 
interventions that have been studied, then they would favor the dietary risk 
domain (e.g., a combined fruit and vegetable subsidy plus a sugar tax produced 
estimated lifetime savings of 894,000 health-adjusted life years and health 
system cost-savings of US$11.0 billion; both 3% discount rate). Other potential 
considerations for prioritization included the potential for total health gain 
that includes non-CVD health loss and potential for achieving relatively greater 
per capita health gain for Māori (Indigenous) to reduce health inequities.
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show how CVD risk factor domains could be 
systematically prioritized using a mix of GBD and country-level data. Addressing 
high systolic blood pressure would be the top ranked domain if policy-makers 
focused just on the size of the health loss. But if policy-makers wished to 
maximize health gain and cost-savings using evaluated interventions, dietary 
interventions would be prioritized, e.g., food taxes and subsidies.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding the latest global spatio-temporal pattern of 
prostate cancer burden attributable to smoking can help guide effective global 
health policy. This study aims to elucidate the trends in smoking-related 
prostate cancer from 1990 to 2019 using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 
study data.
METHODS: Data on prostate cancer attributable to smoking were extracted from 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. The numbers and age-standardized 
rates on smoking-related prostate cancer mortality (ASMR) and 
disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) were analyzed by year, age, region, 
country, and socio-demographic index (SDI) level. Estimated annual percentage 
change (EAPC) was calculated to evaluate the temporal trends of ASMR and ASDR 
from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Of all prostate cancer deaths and DALYs globally in 2019, 6% and 6.6% 
were attributable to smoking, which contributed to 29,298 (95% CI 12,789 to 
46,609) deaths and 571,590 (95% CI 253,490 to 917,820) disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) in 2019. The number of smoking-related deaths and DALYs 
showed an upward trend, increasing by half from 1990 to 2019, while ASMR and 
ASDR declined in five sociodemographic indexes (SDI) regions, with the fastest 
decline in high SDI regions. For geographical regions, Western Europe and East 
Asia were the high-risk areas of prostate cancer deaths and DALYs attributable 
to smoking, among which China and the United States were the countries with the 
heaviest burden. The ASMR has decreased in all age groups, with the fastest 
decrease occurring in 75-79 years old. The ASMR or ASDR tended to increase in 
countries with the lowest SDI, but declined in countries with the highest SDI. 
The EAPC in ASMR or ASDR was highly negatively correlated with Human Development 
Index (HDI) in 2019, with coefficients 0.46.
CONCLUSION: The number of smoking-related prostate cancer deaths and DALYs 
continued to increase globally, whereas its ASMR and ASDR have been decreasing. 
This substantial progress is particularly significant in developed regions and 
vary across geographic regions. Medical strategies to prevent and reduce the 
burden should be adjusted and implemented based on country-specific disease 
prevalence.

Poor nations are already facing the heat of double burden of communicable and 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), often known as chronic illnesses, which are 
characterized by a protracted course and are multifactorial in causation. In 
addition to this, neglected non-communicable diseases (NNCD) in the form of 
gout, sickle cell disease, accidents and many more are likely to be one of the 
biggest public health challenges soon. Nearly three-quarters (31.4 million) of 
all NCD-related fatalities occur in developing nations. In terms of morbidity 
and mortality, the "BIG FOUR" NCDs-diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory 
diseases, and cardiovascular diseases-are widely acknowledged as the main 
contributors to global health loss. However, other NCDs account for 55% of the 
global burden of NCDs and are frequently neglected in terms of premature death, 
increased Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), and decreased Quality-Adjusted 
Life Year (QALY). We have briefly discussed the disease burden of a few 
significant, yet neglected NCDs in this paper.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including risk factors, e.g., 
obesity, are the major causes of preventable deaths in China, yet NCD 
disparities in China remain under-studied.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the determinants and burden of NCDs 
within four selected provinces in mainland China: the least developed 
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau group (PG, Tibetan Autonomous Region [TAR] and Qinghai 
Province) and most developed megacity group (MCG, Shanghai, and Beijing).
METHODS: Studies, reports, and other official sources with comparable data for 
NCD burden and related determinants for the four provinces were searched. 
Geographic, demographic, socioeconomic, and dietary characteristics and selected 
health indicators (e.g., life expectancy) were extracted from the China 
Statistical Yearbook and China Health Statistics Yearbook. Data on NCD burdens 
were extracted from the National Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance 
Study and other nationally representative studies.
RESULTS: The overall NCD mortality rates and prevalence of metabolic risk 
factors including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in mainland China have 
increased in the past 20 years, and this trend is expected to continue. The PG 
had the highest level of standardized mortality rates (SMRs) on NCDs 
(711.6-896.1/100,000, 6th/6-level); the MCG had the lowest (290.6-389.6/100,000, 
1st/6-level) in mainland China. The gaps in SMRs were particularly high with 
regard to chronic respiratory diseases (PG 6th/6-level, MCG 1st/6-level) and 
cardiovascular diseases (6th/6 and 4th/6 in TAR and Qinghai; 1st/6-level and 
2nd/6-level in Shanghai and Beijing). In contrast, the prevalence rates of 
obesity, hypertension, and diabetes were generally higher or comparable in MCG 
compared to PG. Diabetes prevalence was particularly high in MCG (5th/5-level, 
13.36-14.35%) and low in PG (1st/5-level, 6.20-10.39%). However, awareness, 
treatment, and control of hypertension were poor in PG. Additionally, PG had 
much lower and severely inadequate intakes of vegetables, fruits, and dairy 
products, with additional indicators of lower socioeconomic status (education, 
income, etc.,) compared with MCG.
CONCLUSION: Evidence showed large disparities in NCD burden in China's 
provinces. Socioeconomic disparity and dietary determinants are probably the 
reasons. Integrated policies and actions are needed.

BACKGROUND: With an increase in life expectancy globally, the focus on digital 
health technologies that can enhance physical and mental health among older 
people with frailty and impairment has increased. Similarly, research interest 
in how digital health technology can promote well-being and self-management of 
health in older age has increased, including an increased focus on methods for 
designing digital health technologies that meet the various medical, 
psychological, and social needs of older population. Despite the increased 
focus, there remains a necessity to further understand the needs of this 
population group to ensure uptake and to avoid introduction of additional 
challenges when introducing technologies, for example, because of poor 
technological design. The scope is limited to digital health technologies meant 
to enable older people with frailty and impairment to age in place.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore how older people with frailty and 
impairment are involved in various parts of the design processes of digital 
health technologies and identify gaps or neglected steps in a user-involving 
design process. This included a focus on recruitment strategies, contributions, 
and methods used to address the perspectives, needs, and desires of older people 
with frailty and impairment in the development of digital health technologies.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension 
for Scoping Reviews) reporting from February 2021 to April 2021. Literature 
searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and IEEE using a search 
string covering the concepts of health technology, older people, frailty and 
impairment, user-centered design, and self-management.
RESULTS: In total, 1891 studies were imported for screening from the initial 
search. A total of 22 studies were included in this review after full-text 
screening and manual search. Invitation through partners was the most reported 
recruitment strategy to involve older people with frailty and impairment in the 
design process of digital health technologies. Furthermore, they were commonly 
involved in the final evaluation of the development process. Three main gaps 
identified were the use of outreach approaches to recruit older people with 
frailty and impairment in the design process of digital health technologies, 
description of the value of involvement and outcome of the contribution of 
participants, and knowledge regarding involvement in all parts of the design 
process.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there is literature on methods for involving older people 
with frailty and impairment in the design of digital health technology, there is 
little methodological dialogue on the nuances of how different methods for 
involvement relate to and shape the outcome of the development process.

INTRODUCTION: Cochlear Implants (CI) are a mainstay in the treatment of severe 
sensorineural hearing loss with proven cost-effectiveness and improved quality 
of life. However, costs associated with CI are variable. During the Covid-19 
pandemic, elective surgeries decreased. The investigation into how the pandemic 
affected CI procedures, costs, and demographic utilization has not been 
elucidated.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information 
System® (PHIS) database, which consists of 50 children's hospitals, was 
performed. Regions were defined according to PHIS guidelines. We evaluated 
number of CIs, total charges and costs, Charge to Cost Ratios (CCR), demographic 
information, and subgrouped this analysis by region throughout 2016-2021. 
Charges were adjusted by CMS wage index for hospital location.
RESULTS: During the years of 2016-2021, there was a rising number of CIs every 
year except for 2020 which had a decrease, largely driven by the southern and 
midwestern regions. The median number of cases did not differ between the years. 
The median adjusted charges increased every year, but not significantly 
($103,883-$125,394). The median CCR also did not differ throughout the years 
(2.7-3.1). Still, there was a larger interquartile range in 2021 (2.3-4.4) for 
the median CCR compared to all other years (2.1-3.8), particularly in the South. 
The percentage of white, non-Hispanic/Latino patients who underwent CI was 
larger in 2020-2021 (78-79.8 %) compared to 2016-2019 (73.3-77.5 %).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of CIs in 2020 was lower than in 2019 or 2021. The 
median CCR for CI procedures increased from 2016 to 2021 but not significantly. 
The range of CCR was larger in 2021 compared to the years prior, suggestive of 
cost shifting by some hospitals to offset the loss in revenue. There was a small 
but significant increase in white, non-Hispanic patients receiving CI in 2020 
and 2021, suggestive of a socio-economic shift in care post pandemic.

Malaria remains as a global life-threatening disorder due to the emergence of 
resistance against standard antimalarials. Consequently, there is a serious need 
to better understand the biology of the malaria parasite in order to determine 
appropriate targets for new interventions. Calcyclin binding protein (CacyBP) is 
a multi-functional and multi-ligand protein that is not well characterized in 
malaria disease. In this study, we have cloned CacyBP from rodent species 
Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis and purified the recombinant protein to carry out 
its detailed molecular, biophysical and immunological characterization. 
Molecular characterization indicates that PyCacyBP is a ∼27 kDa protein in 
parasite lysate and exists in monomer and dimer forms. Bioinformatic analysis of 
CacyBP showed significant sequence and structural similarities between rodent 
and human malaria parasites. CacyBP is expressed in all blood stages of P. 
yoelii nigeriensis parasite. In silico studies proposed the immunogenic 
potential of CacyBP. The rPyCacyBP immunized mice exhibited elevated levels of 
IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 in their serum. Notably, cellular immune response in 
splenocytes from immunized mice showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF-α. This CacyBP exhibited pro-inflammatory 
immune response in rodent host. These finding revealed that CacyBP may have the 
potential to boost the host immunity for protection against malaria infection. 
The present study provides basis for further exploration of the biological 
function of CacyBP in malaria parasite.

BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in 2012, which was modified in 2018 
into shared decision making for men aged 55-70 years with a life expectancy over 
10 years. We studied the trends in PSA screening in younger Black and White men 
with the implementation of the 2012 and 2018 guidelines.
METHODS: Younger Black and White men (aged 40-54 years) were identified using 
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System database biennially from 2012 to 
2020. Our primary outcome was PSA screening within 2 years of the survey. An 
adjusted logistic regression model with 2-way interaction assessment between 
race and survey year was used to investigate the temporal trend of PSA screening 
in younger Black and White men.
RESULTS: A total of 142 892 men were included. We saw steadily decreasing odds 
of PSA screening among both younger Black and White men in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 
2020 compared with 2012 (for younger Black men: odds ratio [OR]2014 = 0.77, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 0.62 to 0.96, OR2016 = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.63, 
OR2018 = 0.33, 95%CI = 0.27 to 0.42, OR2020 = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.32; and 
for younger White men: OR2014 = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.76 to 0.87, OR2016 = 0.66, 95% 
CI = 0.61 to 0.71, OR2018 = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.37 to 0.44, OR2020 = 0.36, 95% 
CI = 0.33 to 0.39). Younger Black men showed a brisker decrease in PSA screening 
in 2016, 2018, and 2020 compared with younger White men (all P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: PSA screening among younger men steadily decreased over the past 
decade since the 2012 United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, 
demonstrating a narrowing racial gap. How such an observed trend translates to 
long-term clinical outcomes for younger Black men remains to be seen.

This paper investigates the role of forests in the life expectancy of people in 
Ghana. We test whether the extinction of forests will inevitably lead to 
extinction of people in Ghana. We first examined the causal relationship between 
life expectancy and deforestation using the full sample bootstrap Granger 
causality test approach and find causality to run from deforestation to life 
expectancy with no feedback from life expectancy to deforestation. Testing for 
parameter stability, the parameters of the VAR model were found to be unstable 
in the short and long run. Consequently, the bootstrap rolling-window Granger 
causality test, a time-varying approach was then employed to examine the true 
nature of the causal relationship that exists between life expectancy and 
deforestation. The results showed that deforestation has a negative effect on 
life expectancy, confirming the widely accepted saying that the health of 
forests is inextricably linked to the health of mankind. The empirical results 
further show that, on trend higher life expectancy increases the rate of 
deforestation in Ghana. Highlighting the importance of the role of forests in 
influencing life expectancy in Ghana, we recommend awareness creation on the 
role of forests in supporting human life and also extensive afforestation 
programs to reduce the rate of deforestation in Ghana. This, we believe, will 
reduce the spread of vector borne diseases such as malaria and reduce the surge 
in respiratory diseases which shorten the life span of Ghanaians.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization recommends a universal 
hepatitis B vaccination within the first 24 h of birth. However, hepatitis B 
vaccines are given during adolescence in many jurisdictions including in 
Ontario, Canada. The objective of this study was to assess the cost 
effectiveness of shifting the hepatitis B vaccination timing from adolescence to 
birth.
METHODS: A state-transition model of 18 health states representing the natural 
history of acute and chronic hepatitis B was developed to conduct a cost-utility 
analysis. Most input parameters were obtained from the Canadian literature or 
publicly available provincial data. The model followed a lifetime model time 
horizon with health outcomes and costs being discounted at 1.5% annually. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the model. Analyses were conducted from a public-payer perspective 
with all costs adjusted to 2021 Canadian dollars.
RESULTS: Hepatitis B vaccination in newborns dominated the current strategy of 
adolescent vaccination. The probabilistic analysis showed that the newborn 
strategy was cost effective in 100% of the iterations at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year and cost saving in 79.39% of the 
iterations. A microsimulation projected that a newborn vaccination may lead to 
reductions in cases by 16.1% in acute hepatitis B, 43.2% in chronic hepatitis B, 
48.2% in hepatocellular carcinoma, and 51.9% in hepatitis B liver-related death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that changing the age of the hepatitis B 
vaccination recommendation from adolescent to newborn is cost effective and 
mostly a cost-saving strategy. Newborn vaccination may lead to cost and health 
benefits while aligning with best available evidence and guidance from the World 
Health Organization.

Skeletal muscle is a tissue integral to general health. Due to its high 
abundance and oxidative capacity, its metabolism is intimately linked to 
whole-body physiology. In the elderly population, mobility correlates positively 
with life expectancy and survival. Furthermore, regular physical activity is one 
of the most effective health-promoting interventions that delay the onset of 
aging-associated chronic diseases. Data from preclinical studies show that aging 
of various tissues is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which plays a central role in energy 
homeostasis. Thus, a hypothesis has emerged that normalization of its content 
would ameliorate the age-related decline in tissue function and therefore 
improve health of the elderly. This idea, along with the documented safety and 
high tolerability of NAD precursor supplementation, makes NAD metabolism a 
prospective target for anti-aging interventions. Interestingly, muscle NAD 
biosynthesis pathways are stimulated by exercise training, which suggests that 
training-induced adaptations rely on tissue NAD levels. However, while the 
relationship between muscle fitness and regular physical activity is 
well-characterized, the proposed synergy between muscle NAD replenishment and 
exercise training has not been established. Here, we review the published data 
on the role of NAD metabolism in exercise in the context of young and aged 
skeletal muscle and discuss the current challenges relevant to the field.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the change in life expectancy (LE) and 
the healthy lifespan among patients with advanced schistosomiasis. This study 
was to evaluate the LE and healthy life expectancy (HLE) for patients and assess 
the mechanism responsible for the LE inequality.
METHODS: We utilized data from a dynamic advanced schistosomiasis cohort (10,362 
patients) for the period from January 2008 to December 2019 in Hunan Province, 
China, to calculate the LEs of patients, and made a comparison with that of 
general population (19,642 schistosomiasis-free individuals) in the 
schistosomiasis endemic areas. LEs were estimated from 15 years of age by 
constructing period life tables. Arriaga's decomposition method was applied to 
quantify the influence of the age structure on the difference in LE. HLE for 
advanced schistosomiasis patients was calculated by using Sullivan method with 
age-specific disability weight. The LE and HLE were calculated for both males 
and females to perform further analyses on gender gap.
RESULTS: The estimated LE for advanced schistosomiasis patients aged 15-19 was 
49.51 years (48.86 years for males and 51.07 years for females), which was 
20.14 years lower compared with general population (69.65 years), and the LE gap 
between patients and general population decreased with age. The largest 
age-specific mortality contribution to the gap (32.06%) occurred at age 
80-84 years. Women had a lower LE and HLE than men at age ≥ 60 years (both 
gender gaps in LE and HLE < 0). For advanced schistosomiasis patients, the 
gender gap in LE was largely attributed to the difference in mortality among 
those under the age of 55; the age-specific mortality in women exerted positive 
influence on the gap at age 25-64 and 75-79 years, with the contribution rate 
ranging from 0.59% to 57.02%, and made the negative contribution at other age 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The LE of advanced schistosomiasis patients was still much lower 
compared with general population. Strengthened prevention strategies and 
targeted treatments are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality due to advanced 
schistosomiasis, especially for younger population and elderly female patients.

PURPOSE: Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of disability in older 
people. Although often underemphasized, it may affect quality of life and 
imposes a considerable burden on the health system. This study evaluated the 
epidemiology of hand OA in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
METHODS: This epidemiological study was performed based on the Global Burden of 
Disease study from 1990 to 2019. The incidence, prevalence, and years lived with 
disability (YLD) in all 21 MENA countries during the study period were reported 
in rate, age-standardized, and percentage.
RESULTS: Hand osteoarthritis in MENA increased 2.7-fold, from 1.6 million cases 
to 4.3 million from 1990 to 2019 with an age-standardized incidence rate of 50.2 
(95% CI, 38.2-66.4) per 100,000 people in 2019. Saudi Arabia had the highest 
age-standardized prevalence in both 1990 (2.3%) and 2019 (2.3%), whereas Turkey 
had the lowest (0.3%) in both years. Total YLDs due to hand osteoarthritis 
increased by more than 2.7-fold, from 50,335 to 135,336 during the study period. 
The highest rate of increase in YLD rate from 1990 to 2019 was in Iran (3.3) and 
the largest decrease was in Qatar (-11.5).
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the global trend, MENA hand OA prevalence and YLDs 
did not decrease between 1990 and 2019 and remained constant over time. Aging 
and increasing obesity rates, particularly among women, might be the 
contributing factors. Hand OA epidemiology varies by country, possibly due to 
genetic, ethnic, and environmental factors.

INTRODUCTION: Due to medical improvements leading to increased life expectancy 
after renal transplantation and widened eligibility criteria allowing older 
patients to be transplanted, incidence of (low-risk) prostate cancer (PCa) is 
increasing among renal transplant recipients (RTR). It remains to be established 
whether active surveillance (AS) for PCa represents a safe treatment option in 
this setting. Therefore, we aim to compare AS discontinuation and oncological 
outcomes of AS for PCa of RTR vs. non-transplant patients.
METHODS: Multicentre study including RTR diagnosed with PCa between 2008 and 
2018 in whom AS was initiated. A subgroup of non-RTR from the St. Antonius 
hospital AS cohort was used as a control group. Comparison of RTR vs. non-RTR 
was performed by 2:1 propensity score matched survival analysis. Outcome 
measures included tumour progression-free survival, treatment-free survival, 
metastasis rates, biochemical recurrence rates and overall survival. Patients 
were matched based on age, year of diagnosis, PSA, biopsy ISUP grade group, 
relative number of positive biopsy cores and clinical stage.
RESULTS: A total of 628 patients under AS were evaluated, including 17 RTRs and 
611 non-RTRs. A total of 13 RTR cases were matched with 24 non-RTR cases. Median 
overall follow-up for the RTR and non-RTR matched cases was, respectively, 5.1 
(IQR 3.2-8.7) years and 5.7 (IQR 4.8-8.1) years. There were no events of 
metastasis and biochemical recurrence among matched cases. The matched-pair 
analysis results in a 1-year and 5-year survival of the RTR and non-RTR patients 
were, respectively, 100 vs. 92%, and 39 vs. 76% for tumour progression, 100 vs. 
91% and 59 vs. 76% for treatment-free survival and, respectively, 100 vs. 100% 
and 88 vs. 100% for overall survival. No significant differences in tumour 
progression-free survival (p = 0.07) and treatment-free survival were observed 
(p = 0.3). However, there was a significant difference in overall survival 
comparing both groups (p = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: AS may be carefully considered in RTR with low-risk PCa. In our 
preliminary analysis, no major differences were present in AS outcomes between 
RTR and non-RTR. Overall mortality was significantly higher in the RTR subgroup.
