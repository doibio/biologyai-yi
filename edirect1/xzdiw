OBJECTIVE: To estimate the overall quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by 
averting 1 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection over the duration of 
the pandemic.
METHODS: A cohort-based probabilistic simulation model, informed by the latest 
epidemiological estimates on COVID-19 in the United States provided by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and literature review. Heterogeneity 
of parameter values across age group was accounted for. The main outcome studied 
was QALYs for the infected patient, patient's family members, and the contagion 
effect of the infected patient over the duration of the pandemic.
RESULTS: Averting a COVID-19 infection in a representative US resident will 
generate an additional 0.061 (0.016-0.129) QALYs (for the patient: 0.055, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.014-0.115; for the patient's family members: 0.006, 
95% CI 0.002-0.015). Accounting for the contagion effect of this infection, and 
assuming that an effective vaccine will be available in 3 months, the total 
QALYs gains from averting 1 single infection is 1.51 (95% CI 0.28-4.37) accrued 
to patients and their family members affected by the index infection and its 
sequelae. These results were robust to most parameter values and were most 
influenced by effective reproduction number, probability of death outside the 
hospital, the time-varying hazard rates of hospitalization, and death in 
critical care.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the health benefits of averting 1 COVID-19 
infection in the United States are substantial. Efforts to curb infections must 
weigh the costs against these benefits.

OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 has put unprecedented pressure on 
healthcare systems worldwide, leading to a reduction of the available healthcare 
capacity. Our objective was to develop a decision model to estimate the impact 
of postponing semielective surgical procedures on health, to support 
prioritization of care from a utilitarian perspective.
METHODS: A cohort state-transition model was developed and applied to 43 
semielective nonpediatric surgical procedures commonly performed in academic 
hospitals. Scenarios of delaying surgery from 2 weeks were compared with 
delaying up to 1 year and no surgery at all. Model parameters were based on 
registries, scientific literature, and the World Health Organization Global 
Burden of Disease study. For each surgical procedure, the model estimated the 
average expected disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per month of delay.
RESULTS: Given the best available evidence, the 2 surgical procedures associated 
with most DALYs owing to delay were bypass surgery for Fontaine III/IV 
peripheral arterial disease (0.23 DALY/month, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.13-0.36) and transaortic valve implantation (0.15 DALY/month, 95% CI: 
0.09-0.24). The 2 surgical procedures with the least DALYs were placing a shunt 
for dialysis (0.01, 95% CI: 0.005-0.01) and thyroid carcinoma resection (0.01, 
95% CI: 0.01-0.02).
CONCLUSION: Expected health loss owing to surgical delay can be objectively 
calculated with our decision model based on best available evidence, which can 
guide prioritization of surgical procedures to minimize population health loss 
in times of scarcity. The model results should be placed in the context of 
different ethical perspectives and combined with capacity management tools to 
facilitate large-scale implementation.

OBJECTIVES: Continuous chemotherapy has been used to treat patients with 
metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (mESCC), despite weak evidence 
supporting a clinical benefit, associated side effects for the patients, and 
unjustified medical costs. In the French setting, we conducted a cost-utility 
analysis alongside the randomized E-DIS trial (NCT01248299), which compared 
first-line fluorouracil/platinum-based chemotherapy continuation (CT-CONT) to CT 
discontinuation (CT-DISC) in progressive-free patients after an initial 6-week 
treatment phase.
METHODS: A partitioned survival analysis was performed using patient-level data 
collected during the trial for survival outcomes, quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), 
and medical costs. The mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and medical 
costs were estimated over an 18-month period to assess the incremental net 
monetary benefit and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Uncertainty was 
handled using the nonparametric bootstrap and univariate analysis. Sixty-seven 
patients with mESCC were randomized and included in the cost-utility analysis.
RESULTS: On average, CT-CONT slightly decreased the number of QALYs (-0.038) and 
increased the cost per patient (+ €1177). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€50 000/QALY, the incremental net monetary benefit was negative (-€3077 [95% 
confidence interval: -6564; 4359]), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was -30 958€/QALY (CT-CONT dominated). The probability of the CT-CONT treatment 
option being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €50 000/QALY, 
compared to CT-DISC, was 29%.
CONCLUSIONS: CT-DISC may be considered as an alternative therapeutic option to 
CT-CONT in patients with mESCC who have stable disease after an initial 
chemotherapy treatment phase. A continuous chemotherapy could indeed reduce the 
number of QALYs because of the disutility associated with the continuous 
treatment.

OBJECTIVES: In January 2009, the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence introduced supplementary guidance for end-of-life (EoL) treatments, 
which allowed treatments with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over the 
regular threshold (£20 000-£30 000) to be recommended, if they satisfied the EoL 
criteria. The aims of this study were (1) to systematically review 10 years of 
EoL supplementary guidance implementation and explore how it could be improved, 
and (2) to create a framework for incorporating the uncertainty relating to EoL 
criteria satisfaction into model-based cost-effectiveness analyses for decision 
making.
METHODS: All appraisals between January 2009 and 2019 were screened for EoL 
discussions. Data were extracted on the EoL criteria and cost-effectiveness 
assessment details. Additionally, a quantitative method was developed to include 
the EoL criteria satisfaction uncertainty into model-based cost-effectiveness 
analyses. A stylized example was created to provide a case study for the 
inclusion of EoL criteria satisfaction uncertainty.
RESULTS: An EoL discussion was identified in 35% of appraisals, 57% of which led 
to a positive EoL decision. Only 5.7% of technologies with positive EoL 
decisions were not recommended, versus 43.8% of technologies with negative EoL 
decisions. EoL criteria assessment was often reported insufficiently and 
evaluated inconsistently and nontransparently. A total of 54.9% of EoL decisions 
were made while at least 1 criterion was surrounded by considerable uncertainty. 
By applying the proposed quantitative method, this EoL criteria satisfaction 
uncertainty was accounted for in decision making. The stylized example 
demonstrated that the impact of EoL criteria satisfaction uncertainty can be 
substantial enough to reverse the reimbursement decision.
CONCLUSIONS: To improve consistency/transparency and correct reimbursement 
decisions' likelihood, new guidelines on the implementation of the EoL criteria 
are needed.

OBJECTIVES: The standard quality-adjusted life year (QALY) model (SQM) assumes 
time-utility independence within constant health states and additive 
independence when health varies over time. The validity of SQM has been 
challenged through reported violations of these assumptions. An alternative 
approach that relaxes these assumptions is to assign a single valuation to an 
entire health profile: an integral assessment of disease severity over time. 
Here, we compare SQM with the annual profile model (APM) and test SQM for 
additive independence.
METHODS: Eighty-two respondents valued 6 episodic conditions, including 4 of 
short duration, with SQM and APM, using the time trade-off method. Inter-rater 
reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Face 
validity was tested by asking respondents how well they were able to imagine the 
health states under SQM and APM. We calculated SQM QALY values for a 1-year time 
period, allowing for a direct comparison with APM values. For the short-term 
conditions we expected higher QALY values for SQM, violating additive 
independence.
RESULTS: APM showed higher interrater reliability (intraclass correlation 
coefficient of 0.53 vs 0.18, respectively) and better face validity than SQM, 
with 6% (APM) vs 21% (SQM) of all respondents reporting difficulties. Additive 
independence of SQM was violated in 5 of the 6 conditions (including the 4 short 
duration health states), with higher QALY values under SQM (mean difference 
0.04).
CONCLUSION: The impact of short-term conditions is systematically underestimated 
under SQM when compared to a health profile model. APM is a less restrictive 
model and demonstrates better validity.

OBJECTIVES: Many economic evaluations of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
screenings have been conducted; however, these vary substantially with regards 
to screening strategies, patient group, and setting. This review aims to report 
the current knowledge of the cost-effectiveness of screening and describe the 
published data.
METHODS: We conducted a search of biomedical and health economic databases up to 
July 2020. We included full and partial health economic studies if they 
evaluated the costs or outcomes of HCC screening strategies.
RESULTS: The review included 43 studies. Due to significant heterogeneity in key 
aspects across the studies, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Most studies 
reported using ultrasound or alpha fetoprotein as screening strategies. 
Screening intervals were mostly annual or biannual. Incidence, diagnostic 
performance, and health state utility values were the most critical parameters 
affecting the cost-effectiveness of screening. The majority of studies reported 
HCC screening to be cost-effective, with the biannual ultrasound + alpha 
fetoprotein standing out as the most cost-effective strategy. However, few 
studies considered the utilization rate, and none considered the diagnostic 
performance of ultrasound in the context of central adiposity. Computed 
tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were also evaluated, but its 
cost-effectiveness was still controversial.
CONCLUSIONS: Although many studies suggested HCC screening was cost-effective, 
substantial limitations of the quality of these studies means the results should 
be interpreted with caution. Future modeling studies should consider the impact 
of central adiposity on the precision of ultrasound, real-world utilization 
rates and projections of increased HCC incidence.

Rugao city is a typical longevity area taking shallow groundwater as the primary 
drinking water source. To determine the relationship between longevity and 
groundwater conditions, the hydrogeochemical characteristics and related causes 
of potable groundwater were investigated. On this basis, the water quality index 
(WQI) and hazard index (HI) of groundwater were evaluated. Meanwhile, the 
nutrient indicators beneficial to human health, like Ca and Mg concentrations, 
were also considered to explore the relationship. The results were as following: 
(1) 91.3% of water samples fell under the Ca/Mg-HCO3 water type, which resulted 
from the dissolution of silicate rock. Na, Cl-, Br, B in groundwater emanated 
from seawater intrusion. The abnormal concentrations of NO3- and As also 
indicated that anthropogenic activities had exerted significant influences on 
groundwater quality. (2) The average WQI value was 30.19, which meant that the 
overall groundwater quality in Rugao city was pretty good. However, 8 water 
samples were found to have HI values above 1, which might be attributed to the 
high concentration of As (maximum value 0.0407 mg/L; mean value 0.0076 mg/L). In 
general, low WQI and HI values corresponded to towns with a high longevity 
population; what's more, WQI and HI values of Rugao city were lower than those 
of non-longevity areas. (3) Comparing with adjacent non-longevity areas, the 
potable groundwater in Rugao city had the characteristics of high Ca (mean value 
123.57 mg/L), high Mg (mean value 50.33 mg/L) and high SO42- (mean value 
525.19 mg/L). The daily intake of Ca and Mg from drinking water could meet 12.4% 
and 22.4% of daily Ca and Mg requirements, respectively. Also, the areas where 
the Sr and B concentrations were higher usually had higher life expectancy. The 
high concentrations of Ca, Mg, SO42-, Sr and B in drinking water, as well as low 
WQI and HI values, probably contribute to physical health and longevity. This 
research helps provide an insight into the relationship between groundwater 
quality and health and can serve as a reference for drinking water quality 
management.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for depression in 
patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and no history of depression.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized trial enrolling 1500 
patients with ACS between 2013 and 2017. Patients were randomized to no 
screening, screening and notifying the primary care provider (PCP), and 
screening, notifying the PCP, and providing enhanced depression treatment. 
Outcomes measured were Healthcare utilization, costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: 7.1% of patients screened positive for depressive symptoms. There was 
no significant difference in usage of mental health services, cardiovascular 
tests and procedures, and medications. Mean total costs in No Screen group 
($7440), in Screen, Notify, and Treat group ($6745), and in Screen and Notify 
group ($6204). The difference was only significant in the Screen and Notify 
group versus the No Screen group (-$1236, 95% confidence interval -$2388 to 
-$96). Because mean QALYs were higher (+0.003 QALY in Screen and Notify; +0.004 
QALYs in Screen, Notify, and Treat) and mean total costs were lower in both 
intervention groups, these interventions were cost-effective. There was 
substantial uncertainty because confidence intervals around cost differences 
were wide and QALY effects were small.
CONCLUSION: Depression screening strategies for patients with ACS may be 
modestly cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: The phase 3 NCT00793962 trial demonstrated that postmastectomy 
hypofractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) was noninferior to conventional 
fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT) in patients with high-risk breast cancer. 
This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of postmastectomy HFRT vs CFRT based 
on the NCT00793962 trial.
METHODS: A Markov model was adopted to synthesize the medical costs and health 
benefits of patients with high-risk breast cancer based on data from the 
NCT00793962 trial. Main outcomes were discounted lifetime costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). We employed a time-dependent horizon from Chinese, French and USA payer 
perspectives. Model robustness was evaluated with one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Patients receiving CFRT versus HFRT gained an incremental 0.0163 QALYs, 
0.0118 QALYs and 0.0028 QALYs; meanwhile an incremental cost of $2351.92, 
$4978.34 and $8812.70 from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives, 
respectively. Thus CFRT versus HFRT yielded an ICER of $144,281.47, $420,636.10 
and $3,187,955.76 per QALY from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives, 
respectively. HFRT could maintain a trend of >50% probabilities of 
cost-effectiveness below a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $178,882.00 in China, 
while HFRT was dominant relative to CFRT, regardless of the WTP values in France 
and the USA. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICERs were most sensitive 
to the parameters of overall survival after radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Postmastectomy HFRT could be used as a cost-effective substitute 
for CFRT in patients with high-risk breast cancer and should be considered in 
appropriately selected patients.

Historically, asparagus is a vegetable with abundant phytochemicals 
(polyphenols, saponins, asparagusic acid, and alkaloids) and crucial 
bioactivities (neuroprotective, antianxiety, antityrosinase, antioxidant, 
antibacterial, and antiasthma effects). Numerous investigations indicated that 
processing technologies have a significant influence on the physicochemical, 
functional, and microstructural characteristics of asparagus. This review 
presents an updated overview of novel applications of processing technologies, 
including ultrasound treatments (in terms of extraction, purification, and 
preservation), heating treatments (hydrothermal treatments, thermal treatments, 
and combination heating treatments), high-pressure processing, representative 
shelf-life extension technologies, and green extraction technologies. These 
physical technologies enhance the yields of bioactive substances, bioactivities 
and product quality. In addition, utilizing the novel technologies (ohmic 
heating, cold plasma, pulsed electric fields, membrane processing) and 
conventional technologies with novel effects to fully develop the potential of 
asparagus should also be taken into consideration in the future.

OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to report the demographic and clinical 
characteristics of two new cases with non-paraneoplastic anti-Hu-associated gut 
motility impairment, and perform a thorough revision covering anti-Hu-associated 
paraneoplastic (PGID) and non-paraneoplastic (nPGID) gastrointestinal 
dysmotility.
BACKGROUND: Several case series have clearly established a relationship between 
certain type of cancers, the development of circulating anti-Hu antibodies, and 
the concomitant usually severe gastrointestinal dysmotility; in contrast, a few 
studies focused on anti-Hu-associated nPGID.
METHODS: We searched for studies regarding anti-Hu-associated gastrointestinal 
manifestations and extracted data concerning clinical characteristics of 
patients, including specific demographic, oncological, neurological, 
gastrointestinal, histological, and treatment response features.
RESULTS: Forty-nine articles with a total of 59 cases of anti-Hu-associated 
gastrointestinal dysmotility were analyzed. The patients' age at symptom onset 
significantly differed between PGID and nPGID (median 61 vs 31 years, 
p < 0.001). Most cancers (95%) in PGID were detected within 24 months from the 
beginning of gastrointestinal symptoms. The impairment of gastrointestinal 
motility was generalized (i.e., involving the whole gut) in 59.3% of patients, 
with no significant differences between PGID vs nPGID group. nPGID patients 
showed a better response to immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive treatment and a 
longer life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Hu-associated gastrointestinal dysmotility covers a wide 
clinical spectrum. Patients with otherwise unexplained gastrointestinal 
dysmotility, especially when associated with other neurological symptoms, should 
be tested for anti-Hu antibodies regardless age of onset and disease duration. 
Compared to PGID, nPGID occurs in younger patients with a long duration of 
disease.

BACKGROUND: We assessed secular trends in the burden of ischaemic heart disease 
(IHD), stroke, and dementia in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) countries.
METHODS: Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017, we compared 
sex-specific and age-standardized rates of disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY); mortality, incidence, and prevalence of IHD and stroke; and dementia per 
100,000 people, in the world, OECD countries, and Canada.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2017, the crude incidence number of IHD, stroke, and 
dementia increased 52%, 76%, and 113%, respectively. Likewise, the prevalence of 
IHD (75%), stroke (95%), and dementia (119%) increased worldwide. In addition 
during the study period, the crude global number of deaths of IHD increased 52%, 
stroke by 41%, and dementia by 146% (9, 6, and 3 million deaths in 2017, 
respectively). Despite an increase in the crude number of these diseases, the 
global age-standardized incidence rate of IHD, stroke, and dementia decreased by 
-27%, - 11%, and - 5%, respectively. Moreover, there was a decline in their 
age-standardized DALY rates (- 1.17%, - 1.32%, and - 0.23% per year, 
respectively) and death rates (- 1.29%, - 1.46%, and - 0.17% per year, 
respectively), with sharper downward trends in Canada and OECD countries. Almost 
all trends flattened during the last decade.
CONCLUSIONS: From 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized burden of IHD, stroke, and 
dementia decreased, more prominently in OECD countries than the world. However, 
their rising crude numbers mainly due to population growth and ageing require 
urgent identification of reversible risk and protective factors.

BACKGROUND: The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health performed a health 
technology assessment regarding statins in primary care. The chosen models may 
lead to a situation where a clinically indicated statin therapy is estimated not 
to be cost effective.
METHODS: We performed a cohort study regarding cardiovascular events, comparing 
SCORE and AGLA risk categories with tertiles of carotid plaque burden and used 
two models for cost-effectiveness analysis of high-potency statins.
RESULTS: Subjects (n = 2842) were followed up for 5.9 &plusmn; 2.9 years with 
the occurrence of 154 cardiovascular events (extrapolated 10-year risk was 
9.2%). Carotid plaque imaging (total plaque area, TPA) significantly improved 
cardiovascular risk prediction compared with AGLA and SCORE for event-free 
survival prediction, test accuracy (discrimination) and calibration. 
Discrimination was significantly improved by about 4% with the inclusion of TPA. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
sensitivity analyses (based on 16 models) ranged between CHF 144,496 and 
&minus;128,328 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness analysis using direct and indirect 
costs showed that a treat-them-all strategy in the Swiss population would be 
cost effective with a return-on-investment per patient in 10 years of between 
CHF 4442 and 19,059, and the use of carotid imaging was also cost effective 
(incremental cost-efficiency ratio &minus;2.97 to &minus;7.86).
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid ultrasound significantly improved cardiovascular risk 
stratification and is cost effective. The Swiss Medical Board QALY model 
presents several drawbacks, which are shown in our sensitivity analysis, where 
results vary considerably and are not useful for clinical decision making. A 
&ldquo;treat them all&rdquo; strategy with statins in the Swiss population aged 
30&ndash;65 years may be cost effective, when indirect costs of avoidable 
cardiovascular events are included, even at an unacceptably low value of a 
statistical life year.

CHAPTER 1: HOW AUSTRALIA IMPROVED HEALTH EQUITY THROUGH ACTION ON THE SOCIAL 
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Do not think that the social determinants of health 
equity are old hat. In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the 
societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy 
that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action 
to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In 
this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey 
where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive 
progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was 
committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It 
is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral 
stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. CHAPTER 2: ABORIGINAL 
AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER CONNECTION TO CULTURE: BUILDING STRONGER INDIVIDUAL 
AND COLLECTIVE WELLBEING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have 
long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is 
vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding 
has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research 
methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture 
is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its 
significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By 
extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until 
recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said - that strong 
culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. 
Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of 
health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, 
to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health 
and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and 
wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper 
understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people. CHAPTER 3: PHYSICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: HEALTHY, 
LIVEABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES: Good city planning is essential for 
protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, 
collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. 
We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose 
an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning 
for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public 
health leaders to collaborate with city planners - to advocate for 
evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning 
efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels 
of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities 
for all. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE ANTHROPOCENE: THE ECOLOGICAL 
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the 
natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of 
health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, 
and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits 
of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological 
determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary 
health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in 
Australia. We highlight Australia's position as a major fossil fuel producer and 
exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. 
We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a 
scaffold of guiding approaches - planetary health, Indigenous people's knowledge 
systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient 
development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a 
recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia 
over the coming decade. CHAPTER 5: DISRUPTING THE COMMERCIAL DETERMINANTS OF 
HEALTH: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human 
and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, 
current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities 
and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for 
Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the 
power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. 
We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to 
protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing 
unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how 
healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make 
recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations 
to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and 
prosperous future Australia. CHAPTER 6: DIGITAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: THE 
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological 
change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such 
as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum 
computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public 
health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of 
digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital 
revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and 
integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and 
wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving 
many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical 
applications and use. CHAPTER 7: GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH AND EQUITY: A VISION FOR 
OUR FUTURE: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to 
take stock on Australia's direction in relation to health, community, jobs, 
environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the 
air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what 
we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing - most 
pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We 
present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to 
ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the 
involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for 
Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social 
progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights 
(including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an 
independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and 
democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and 
community development.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) has traditionally been 
managed with palliative chemotherapy regimens or best supportive care (BSC). 
Avelumab, a novel anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) human monoclonal 
antibody for mMCC treatment, is being studied in the pivotal JAVELIN Merkel 200 
trial.
AIM: Incorporating trial results, this analysis aimed to evaluate the 
cost-utility of avelumab in Taiwan.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A de novo partitioned-survival model with three key health 
states related to survival (progression-free disease, progressed disease, and 
death) was applied in this study. The data of clinical efficacy, safety, and 
patient utilities were obtained from the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, literature 
review, and Taiwanese clinical expert opinion. Cost-utility analysis was 
performed, and results were presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. For treatment-naïve patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) for avelumab vs BSC and avelumab vs chemotherapy were US$44885.06 
and US$42993.06 per QALY gained, respectively. As to treatment-experienced mMCC 
patients, avelumab was associated with ICERs of US$27243.06 (vs BSC)/US$26557.43 
(vs chemotherapy) per QALY gained. All ICERs remained consistently within the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$53,333.33 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated avelumab to be a cost-effective treatment 
option for both treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve mMCC patients with 
very poor prognosis in Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLHIV) receive free antiretroviral treatment 
(ART) in public health facilities of India. With improved life expectancy, unmet 
sexual and reproductive health needs of PLHIV have to be addressed through a 
converged programmatic response strategy. Evidence shows that socioeconomically 
disadvantaged women are most vulnerable to high reproductive morbidities, 
especially HIV positive women with an unmet need of contraception.
METHODS: Programmatic convergence by linking ART and family planning services 
were strengthened at two public health facilities (district hospitals) generally 
accessed by disadvantaged socio-economic sections of the society. Barriers to 
linking services including stigma and discrimination were addressed through 
analysis of existing linkage situation, sensitization and training of healthcare 
providers and system-level interventions. This facilitated provider-initiated 
assessment of contraceptive needs of PLHIV, counseling about dual contraception 
using a couple approach, linkage to family planning centers and maintaining data 
about these indicators. Six hundred eligible PLHIV seeking care at ART centers 
were enrolled and followed up for a duration of 6 months. Acceptance of family 
planning services as a result of the intervention, use of dual contraception 
methods and their determinants were assessed.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent HIV couples reached FP centers and 44.6% accepted 
dual methods at the end of the study period. Dual methods such as oral 
contraceptive pills (56.2%), IUCDs (19.4%), female sterilization (11.6%), 
injectable contraception (9.9%) and vasectomy (2.9%) in addition to condoms were 
the most commonly accepted methods. Condom use remained regular and consistently 
high throughout. The study witnessed seven unintended pregnancies, all among 
exclusive condom users. These women availed medical abortion services and 
accepted dual methods after counseling. Female index participants, concordant 
couples, counseling by doctors and women with CD4 count above 741 had higher 
odds of accepting dual contraception methods. Standard operating procedures 
(SOP) were developed in consultation with key stakeholders to address 
operational linkage of HIV and family programs.
CONCLUSION: The study saw significant improvement in acceptance of dual 
contraception by PLHIV couples as a result of the intervention. Implementation 
of SOPs with supportive supervision can ensure efficient linkage of programs and 
provide holistic sexual and reproductive healthcare for PLHIV in India.
