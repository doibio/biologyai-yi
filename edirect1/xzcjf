with microprolactinoma diagnosed in perimenopausal period had not been offered 
DA; PRL decreased (but not normalized) during observation of 1 and 8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolactin normalized over time in nearly half of the women and 
serum PRL 6-12 months after DA withdrawal is useful predictor. Nonetheless, 7% 
of the patients demonstrated adenoma regrowth which, given the life expectancy 
postmenopause, necessitate regular monitoring of the cases with persistent 
hyperprolactinaemia.

Health-care companies around the world face an unprecedented challenge of rising 
health-care costs, increasing life expectancy and escalating demand. Although 
national health-care budgets have increased (as a percentage of gross domestic 
product) health care continues to impart significant upward pressure on national 
expenditure, particularly in the UK ( Licchetta and Stelmach, 2016 ). 
Additionally a substantial funding gap will continue to grow ( Gainsbury, 2016 
). In response to this challenge a 'value' based strategy has gained momentum 
over the last two decades. Several pioneers of this approach (Sir Muir Gray at 
Oxford University, Professor Michael Porter at Harvard University and Professor 
Elizabeth Teisberg at Dell Medical School) emphasize the importance of 
organizations focusing on 'value'. Porter and Teisberg (2006) highlight the 
'value equation' as obtaining the very best patient outcomes for each unit of 
currency spent. Gray expands on this model, describing three types of value: 
allocative, technical and personal ( Gray, 2011 ). Although some global 
health-care organizations have embraced the value-based agenda to transform 
acute care facilities, mental health providers have been slow to consider the 
benefits of this approach. This article gives a broad overview of implementing a 
value-based model in mental health care, the significant development resources 
needed, organizational issues, and finally concludes with the benefits and a 
vision of value-based mental health care for the future.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to (a) identify and assess the quality 
of reporting of published cost-effectiveness studies of bariatric surgery, (b) 
assess their transferability to Switzerland, and (c) adapt transferable 
cost-effectiveness results to Switzerland.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase and 
other databases. Two reviewers independently undertook screening, extraction, 
assessment of reporting quality utilising the Consolidated Health Economic 
Evaluation Reporting Standards, transferability, adaptation of cost data and 
recalculation of cost-effectiveness results. Cost data were adapted in three 
steps: correction for different levels of resource utilisation, for different 
prices of healthcare services and for change in costs over time.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies fulfilled criteria for adaptation of cost data to 
Switzerland. Four out of fifteen adapted studies with a long time-horizon for 
patients with a body mass index (BMI) >35kg/m2 indicated bariatric surgery to be 
a cost-saving (dominant) approach compared with conventional treatment. Other 
studies for patients with BMI >35kg/m2 showed cost-effective results, with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below CHF 50,000 per quality 
adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Two studies assessed cost-effectiveness for 
patients with BMI <35kg/m2, and revealed ICERs below 50,000 per QALY gained for 
bariatric surgery versus conventional treatment. Between-study differences were 
related to approaches for the modelling effectiveness and costs, time horizon, 
population, type of intervention and possibly other unidentified reasons. 
Gastric bypass appeared to be superior to gastric banding, but was more 
expensive.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all studies found bariatric surgery to be a cost saving or 
cost-effective compared with conventional treatment. The adaptation of existing 
cost-effectiveness analyses cannot be considered to give accurate ICERs for 
Switzerland, but may have achieved an approximation of cost-effectiveness levels 
to be expected for Switzerland. It has made the results of international 
cost-effectiveness studies reported for different countries and in different 
currencies more comparable, and may be useful for individual countries in which 
financing or capacity for economic analyses is scarce.

The study of prognostic understanding is imperative as the trend toward 
individualized medicine continues. However, without guidelines for discussing 
prognosis, palliative care clinicians face challenges presenting prognostic 
information in a way that optimizes patient understanding, psychological 
adjustment, and decision-making. The present study draws on the experiences of 
experts in the field of palliative care in order to examine the communication of 
prognostic information. Fifteen oncology, psycho-oncology, and palliative care 
professionals with expertise in doctor-patient communication participated in 
semi-structured interviews that focused on identifying the breadth of factors 
underlying prognostic understanding, as well as methods to identify and quantify 
this understanding. Three independent raters utilized a thematic content 
analysis framework to identify core themes that reflected unique aspects of 
prognostic understanding. Interviews yielded 2 types of information. 
Participants described the multifaceted nature of prognostic understanding and 
identified 5 distinct elements of prognostic understanding: understanding of 
current state of disease, life expectancy, curability, decline trajectory, and 
available treatment options. Participants also offered "best practice" 
techniques, including methods for determining a patient's preferences for and 
understanding of prognostic information, assessing patient fears and concerns, 
and communicating medical uncertainties. Results emphasize the need for 
clinicians to join with patients to ensure that prognostic information is well 
understood. These results highlight the salience of health information 
preferences and strategies to provide comprehensive prognostic information, 
compassionately and with respect for each individual patient.

BACKGROUND: Decisions about which subgroup of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients 
should be treated with direct acting anti-viral agents (DAAs) have economic 
importance due to high drug prices. Treat-all DAA strategies for CHC have gained 
acceptance despite high drug acquisition costs. However, there are also costs 
associated with the surveillance of CHC to determine a subgroup of patients with 
significant impairment. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the 
modelling methods used and summarise results in cost-effectiveness analyses 
(CEAs) of both CHC treatment with DAAs and surveillance of liver disease.
METHODS: Electronic databases including Embase and Medline were searched from 
inception to May 2015. Eligible studies included models predicting costs and/or 
outcomes for interventions, surveillance, or management of people with CHC. 
Narrative and quantitative synthesis were conducted. Quality appraisal was 
conducted using validated checklists. The review was conducted following 
principles published by NHS Centre for Research and Dissemination.
RESULTS: Forty-one CEAs met the eligibility criteria for the review; 37 
evaluated an intervention and four evaluated surveillance strategies for 
targeting DAA treatment to those likely to gain most benefit. Included studies 
were of variable quality mostly due to reporting omissions. Of the 37 CEAs, 
eight models that enabled comparative analysis were fully appraised and 
synthesized. These models provided non-unique cost-effectiveness estimates in a 
specific DAA comparison in a specific population defined in terms of genotype, 
prior treatment status, and presence or absence of cirrhosis. Marked 
heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness estimates was observed despite this 
stratification. Approximately half of the estimates suggested that DAAs were 
cost-effective considering a threshold of US$30,000 and 73% with threshold of 
US$50,000. Two models evaluating surveillance strategies suggested that treating 
all CHC patients regardless of the staging of liver disease could be 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: CEAs of CHC treatments need to better account for variability in 
their estimates. This analysis suggested that there are still circumstances 
where DAAs are not cost-effective. Surveillance in place of a treat-all strategy 
may still need to be considered as an option for deploying DAAs, particularly 
where acquisition cost is at the limit of affordability for a given health 
system.

INTRODUCTION: Considering the old age, uncertain life expectancy, co-morbidities 
and fear of postoperative complications, elderly patients often hesitate to 
undergo simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA).
MATERIALS & METHODS: A retrospective study of SBTKA in 46 patients (92 knees) of 
age >70 years done between 2003 and 2012. Mean age was 80.13 ± 5.24 years (range 
-70-93 years).
RESULTS: 74 percent had 1 or more major medical problems. There was a 
significant improvement of KSS at six months (p value = 0.00).
CONCLUSION: With expected benefits of surgery, SBTKA seems a safe, efficient, 
and viable procedure for carefully selected elderly patients.

Acetabular Cup Revision Arthroplasty Using Morselized Impaction Allograft.

Lee JM(1), Kim TH(1).

Author information:

University, Seongnam, Korea.

The rate of acetabular cup revision arthroplasty is gradually rising along with 
an increased risk of osteolysis and prosthesis loosening over time and an 
increase in life expectancy. The goals of revision total hip arthroplasty are: 
i) implant stability through reconstruction of large bone defects, ii) 
restoration of range of motion and biomechanics of the hip joint, and iii) 
normalization of uneven limb lengths. In acetabular cup revision arthroplasty, 
stable fixation of acetabular components is difficult in the presence of severe 
bone loss (e.g., evidence suggests that it is challenging to achieve 
satisfactory results in cases of Paprosky type 3 or higher bone defects using 
conventional techniques). The author of this study performed acetabular revision 
to manage patients with large areas of defective bones by filling in with 
morselized impaction allografts. These allografts were irradiated frozen-stored 
femoral heads acquired from a tissue bank, and were applied to areas of an 
acetabular bone defect followed by insertion of a cementless cup. When this 
procedure was insufficient to obtain primary fixation, a tri-cortical or 
structural allograft using a femoral head was carried out. Structural stability 
and bone incorporation were confirmed via long-term follow-up. This study aims 
to review conventional surgical techniques and verify the utility of surgical 
procedures by analyzing the author's surgical methods and discussing case 
reports.

BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Interest in treatments for elderly patients has increased with 
life expectancy, and various studies have reported on the safety and feasibility 
of radical surgery in elderly patients with cancer. Here, we investigated 
oncologic outcomes of periampullary cancer in octogenarians.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 68 patients over 80 
years of age who were diagnosed with periampullary cancer and were eligible for 
surgery; we analyzed overall survival (OS) and immediate postoperative 
complications and mortality.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean age, disease type, 
oncologic features, comorbidities, or nutritional status between the patients 
who had surgery and those who did not. Five patients (20.0%) had major 
postoperative complications, but there was no immediate postoperative mortality. 
Patients who had surgery (n=25) had better OS (29.3 months; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 5.6-53.0) than did those who did not (n=43, OS: 7.6 months; 95% 
CI: 3.2-12.0 months; p<0.001). Similarly, patients with distal common bile duct 
cancer who underwent surgery had better OS than those who did not (surgery 
group: n=13, OS: 29.3 months, 95% CI: 8.9-49.7; non-surgery group: n=15, OS: 5.7 
months, 95% CI: 4.2-7.2 months; p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Radical surgery for octogenarian patients with periampullary cancer 
is safe, feasible, and expected to result in better survival outcomes, 
especially for patients with common bile duct cancer.

MOTIVATION: The study of comorbidities is a major priority due to their impact 
on life expectancy, quality of life and healthcare cost. The availability of 
electronic health records (EHRs) for data mining offers the opportunity to 
discover disease associations and comorbidity patterns from the clinical history 
of patients gathered during routine medical care. This opens the need for 
analytical tools for detection of disease comorbidities, including the 
investigation of their underlying genetic basis.
RESULTS: We present comoRbidity, an R package aimed at providing a systematic 
and comprehensive analysis of disease comorbidities from both the clinical and 
molecular perspectives. comoRbidity leverages from (i) user provided clinical 
data from EHR databases (the clinical comorbidity analysis) and (ii) 
genotype-phenotype information of the diseases under study (the molecular 
comorbidity analysis) for a comprehensive analysis of disease comorbidities. The 
clinical comorbidity analysis enables identifying significant disease 
comorbidities from clinical data, including sex and age stratification and 
temporal directionality analyses, while the molecular comorbidity analysis 
supports the generation of hypothesis on the underlying mechanisms of the 
disease comorbidities by exploring shared genes among disorders. The open-source 
comoRbidity package is a software tool aimed at expediting the integrative 
analysis of disease comorbidities by incorporating several analytical and 
visualization functions.

Sickle cell anemia is a haematological disorder characterized by multiple 
vaso-occlusive complications, resulting in a reduced life expectancy. These 
patients are exposed to several triggering factors for sickle cell crises when 
they are submitted to cardiovascular surgeries with extracorporeal circulation. 
Therefore, meticulous care and perioperative management are required. This paper 
reports a successful case of combined cardiovascular surgery - aortic valve 
replacement and ascending aortic aneurysmectomy - with no serious post-operative 
complications. In this report, we emphasize the peculiarities of perioperative 
care in patients with sickle cell anemia.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy and improved surgical techniques have led 
to a sharp rise in healthcare resource consumption by older patients. In these 
patients early recovery of walking ability after abdominal surgery may shorten 
length of hospital stay and reduce overall healthcare costs, but it is important 
to understand what factors determine this recovery.
AIM: To assess preoperative and postoperative determinants of walking ability 
recovery after major abdominal surgery in older patients.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: General Surgery Unit.
POPULATION: The study included 327 consecutive older inpatients who underwent 
major acute-care abdominal surgery.
METHODS: Data on demographic characteristics, diagnosis, comorbidities defined 
by Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), preoperative walking ability, and early 
postoperative physical deconditioning (PPDS) were gathered. All patients 
underwent an individually-tailored rehabilitation program. At discharge, pain 
(by a Visual Analogue Scale, VAS-pain, 0-10), transfers and walking ability were 
assessed. Number of rehabilitation sessions attended and discharge setting were 
recorded.
RESULTS: Of 320 patients included in the analysis (7 died), 72% had CCI>5, 
signifying presence of >1 comorbidities. Before hospitalization, 79% of patients 
were completely independent in walking at home, 12% needed assistive devices or 
direct assistance from the caregiver, and 9% were unable to walk. Complex 
postoperative physical deconditioning was detected in 25%. At discharge, most 
patients (87%) had achieved their rehabilitative goal and returned home. Only 
PPDS and VAS-pain were able to predict both walking ability and the discharge 
setting, PPDS alone showing adequate sensitivity (82%) and specificity (70%).
CONCLUSIONS: PPDS was the sole early postoperative predictor of recovery of 
walking ability and the discharge setting. Pain therapy might be a key factor 
influencing the postoperative functional decline. Age and severity of 
preoperative comorbidities seem not important determinants of functional decline 
in older surgical patients.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: An early postoperative assessment of physical 
deconditioning might be able to predict the walking ability at discharge (hence, 
the discharge setting), in older patients undergoing major surgery.

AIMS: Obinutuzumab (GA101, G) was approved in February 2016 by the US Food and 
Drug Administration to treat follicular lymphoma (FL) patients who relapsed 
after, or are refractory to (R/R), a rituximab-containing regimen 
(R/R-rituximab). In the GADOLIN trial, R/R-rituximab patients who received G 
plus bendamustine (B) followed by G-monotherapy (G + B) for up to 2 years had 
significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared 
to patients receiving B-monotherapy. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness 
of G + B vs B-monotherapy for R/R-rituximab FL patients from a US payer 
perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient outcomes were simulated using a 3-state area 
under the curve model including progression-free survival, progressive disease, 
and death. This study used R/R-rituximab data from the National LymphoCare Study 
to extrapolate the GADOLIN trial's refractory FL progression-free and overall 
survival data to a R/R-rituximab FL population. Drug utilization and adverse 
events were based on trial data, and costs were based on Medicare reimbursements 
and drug wholesale acquisition costs in 2016. Utility estimates were derived 
from published literature. Post-progression treatment costs were based on 
observed post-progression therapies in GADOLIN. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to assess model uncertainty.
RESULTS: G + B resulted in an increase in quality-adjusted life years relative 
to B-monotherapy of 1.24 (95% CR = 0.61-1.87); the incremental total cost was 
$58,100 (95% CR = $54,500-$61,500). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
$47,000 per QALY gained, and, based on probabilistic simulations, there was a 
98% probability that G + B was cost-effective at the $100,000 per QALY 
threshold.
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: This US-based analysis suggests that treatment with 
G + B compared to B-monotherapy is likely cost-effective in R/R-rituximab FL 
patients. Modeling a R/R-rituximab population based on a synthesis of GADOLIN 
and the National LymphoCare Study data introduces uncertainty in the analysis. 
However, the findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.

BACKGROUND: Adherence to recommendations and medication is deemed to be 
important for effectiveness of case management interventions. Thus, reasons for 
non-adherence and effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) should be 
fully understood. The objective of this research was to identify determinants of 
non-adherence to medication and recommendations, and to test whether increased 
adherence improved HRQoL in patients after myocardial infarction (MI) in a case 
management intervention.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the intervention group of the KORINNA study, a 
randomized controlled trail of a nurse-led case management intervention with 
targeted recommendations in the elderly after MI in Germany. Reasons for 
non-adherence were described. Logistic mixed effects models and OLS (ordinary 
least squares) were used to analyze the effect of recommendations on the 
probability of adherence and the association between adherence and HRQoL.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients with 965 contacts were included. 
Frequent reasons for non-adherence to medication and recommendations were 
"forgotten" (22%; 11%), "reluctant" (18%; 18%), "side effects" (38%; 7%), "the 
problem disappeared" (6%; 13%), and "barriers" (0%; 13%). The probability of 
adherence was lowest for disease and self-management (38%) and highest for 
visits to the doctor (61%). Only if patients diverging from prescribed 
medication because of side effects were also considered as adherent, 3-year 
medication adherence was associated with a significant gain of 0.34 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: Most important determinants of non-adherence to medication were 
side effects, and to recommendations reluctance. Recommended improvements in 
disease and self-management were least likely adhered. Medication adherence was 
associated with HRQoL.

Photoreceptor-specific ciliopathies often affect a structure that is considered 
functionally homologous to the ciliary transition zone (TZ) called the 
connecting cilium (CC). However, it is unclear how mutations in certain ciliary 
genes disrupt the photoreceptor CC without impacting the primary cilia 
systemically. By applying stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy 
technology in different genetic models, we show that the CC can be partitioned 
into two regions: the proximal CC (PCC), which is homologous to the TZ of 
primary cilia, and the distal CC (DCC), a photoreceptor-specific extension of 
the ciliary TZ. This specialized distal zone of the CC in photoreceptors is 
maintained by SPATA7, which interacts with other photoreceptor-specific ciliary 
proteins such as RPGR and RPGRIP1. The absence of Spata7 results in the 
mislocalization of DCC proteins without affecting the PCC protein complexes. 
This collapse results in destabilization of the axonemal microtubules, which 
consequently results in photoreceptor degeneration. These data provide a novel 
mechanism to explain how genetic disruption of ubiquitously present ciliary 
proteins exerts tissue-specific ciliopathy phenotypes.

How organisms discount the value of future rewards is associated with many 
important outcomes, and may be a central component of theories of life-history. 
According to life-history theories, prioritizing immediacy is indicative of an 
accelerated strategy (i.e. reaching reproductive maturity quickly and producing 
many offspring at the cost of long-term investment). Previous work extrapolating 
life-history theories to facultative calibration of life-history traits within 
individuals has theorized that cues to mortality can trigger an accelerated 
strategy; however, compelling evidence for this hypothesis in modern humans is 
lacking. We assessed whether country-level life expectancy predicts individual 
future discounting behaviour across multiple intertemporal choice items in a 
sample of 13 429 participants from 54 countries. Individuals in countries with 
lower life expectancy were more likely to prefer an immediate reward to one that 
is delayed. Individuals from countries with greater life expectancy were 
especially more willing to wait for a future reward when the relative gain in 
choosing the future reward was large and/or the delay period was short. These 
results suggest that cues to mortality can influence the way individuals 
evaluate intertemporal decisions, which in turn can inform life-history 
trade-offs. We also found that older (but not very old) participants were more 
willing to wait for a future reward when there is a greater relative gain and/or 
shorter delay period, consistent with theoretical models that suggest 
individuals are more future-orientated at middle age.

The sweet potato leaf folder, Brachmia macroscopa Meyrick (Lepidoptera: 
Gelechiidae), which is a significant pest of plants in the family 
Convolvulaceae, is rapidly expanding its range in South China and other 
subtropical regions. Studies were designed to examine the effects of three 
different host plants (sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.; water spinach, 
I. aquatica Forsskål; and morning glory, Pharbitis purpurea (L.)) on the 
development and life table parameters of B. macroscopa under laboratory 
conditions. We found that the intrinsic rates of increase of B. macroscopa were 
0.17 ± 0.004, 0.21 ± 0.005 and 0.16 ± 0.004 on I. batatas, I. aquatica and P. 
purpurea, respectively. The highest net reproduction rate was 158.06 ± 18.22 per 
female reared on I. aquatica. The larvae had five instars when reared on I. 
batatas and I. aquatica, but required six instars on P. purpurea. The mean 
generation lengths of B. macroscopa ranged from 24.32 ± 0.18 days when reared on 
I. aquatica to 29.40 ± 0.24 days on P. purpurea. The survival of all stage and 
fecundity curves was intuitively manipulated using the age-stage-structured and 
two-sex population life table method, to enable comprehensive descriptions of 
the stage and population trends of B. macroscopa on the three Convolvulaceae 
plants. Our results indicated that I. batatas and I. aquatica were more suitable 
host plants than P. purpurea.

Most antiaging factors or life span extenders are associated with calorie 
restriction (CR). Very few of these factors function independently of, or 
additively with, CR. In this study, we focused on tschimganine, a compound that 
was reported to extend chronological life span (CLS). Although tschimganine led 
to the extension of CLS, it also inhibited yeast cell growth. We acquired a 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutant with a tolerance for tschimganine due to the 
gene crm1. The resulting Crm1 protein appears to export the stress-activated 
protein kinase Sty1 from the nucleus to the cytosol even under stressful 
conditions. Furthermore, we synthesized two derivative compounds of 
tschimganine, α-hibitakanine and β-hibitakanine; these derivatives did not 
inhibit cell growth, as seen with tschimganine. α-hibitakanine extended the CLS, 
not only in S. pombe but also in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating the 
possibility that life span regulation by tschimganine derivative may be 
conserved across various yeast species. We found that the longevity induced by 
tschimganine was dependent on the Sty1 pathway. Based on our results, we propose 
that tschimganine and its derivatives extend CLS by activating the Sty1 pathway 
in fission yeast, and CR extends CLS via two distinct pathways, one 
Sty1-dependent and the other Sty1-independent. These findings provide the 
potential for creating an additive life span extension effect when combined with 
CR, as well as a better understanding of the mechanism of CLS.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common autoimmune disease in the 
UK, is a chronic systemic inflammatory arthritis that affects 0.8% of the UK 
population.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not an alternative class of biologic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are comparable to rituximab in 
terms of efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with RA in whom initial tumour 
necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) bDMARD and methotrexate (MTX) therapy failed 
because of inefficacy.
DESIGN: Multicentre, Phase III, open-label, parallel-group, three-arm, 
non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of alternative TNFi and abatacept with that of rituximab (and 
background MTX therapy). Eligible consenting patients were randomised in a 
1 : 1 : 1 ratio using minimisation incorporating a random element. Minimisation 
factors were centre, disease duration, non-response category and 
seropositive/seronegative status.
SETTING: UK outpatient rheumatology departments.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years who were diagnosed with RA and were 
receiving MTX, but had not responded to two or more conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapies and had shown an inadequate 
treatment response to a first TNFi.
INTERVENTIONS: Alternative TNFi, abatacept or rituximab (and continued 
background MTX).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was absolute reduction in the Disease 
Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) at 24 weeks post randomisation. Secondary 
outcome measures over 48 weeks were additional measures of disease activity, 
quality of life, cost-effectiveness, radiographic measures, safety and toxicity.
LIMITATIONS: Owing to third-party contractual issues, commissioning challenges 
delaying centre set-up and thus slower than expected recruitment, the funders 
terminated the trial early.
RESULTS: Between July 2012 and December 2014, 149 patients in 35 centres were 
registered, of whom 122 were randomised to treatment (alternative TNFi, n = 41; 
abatacept, n = 41; rituximab, n = 40). The numbers, as specified, were analysed 
in each group [in line with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle]. Comparing 
alternative TNFi with rituximab, the difference in mean reduction in DAS28 at 24 
weeks post randomisation was 0.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to 1.05] in 
the ITT patient population and -0.58 (95% CI -1.72 to 0.55) in the per protocol 
(PP) population. Corresponding results for the abatacept and rituximab 
comparison were 0.04 (95% CI -0.72 to 0.79) in the ITT population and -0.15 (95% 
CI -1.27 to 0.98) in the PP population. General improvement in the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life 
and the patients' general health was apparent over time, with no notable 
differences between treatment groups. There was a marked initial improvement in 
the patients' global assessment of pain and arthritis at 12 weeks across all 
three treatment groups. Switching to alternative TNFi may be cost-effective 
compared with rituximab [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) £5332.02 
per quality-adjusted life-year gained]; however, switching to abatacept compared 
with switching to alternative TNFi is unlikely to be cost-effective (ICER 
£253,967.96), but there was substantial uncertainty in the decisions. The value 
of information analysis indicated that further research would be highly valuable 
to the NHS. Ten serious adverse events in nine patients were reported; none were 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. Two patients died and 10 
experienced toxicity.
FUTURE WORK: The results will add to the randomised evidence base and could be 
included in future meta-analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: How to manage first-line TNFi treatment failures remains 
unresolved. Had the trial recruited to target, more credible evidence on whether 
or not either of the interventions were non-inferior to rituximab may have been 
provided, although this remains speculative.

RELEVANCE: Erectile dysfunction (ED) associated with radical prostatectomy (RP) 
affects 25-75% of patients and has a significant negative impact on their 
quality of life AIM: To analyze the maintenance of erectile function after RP 
depending on the type of endoscopic access and nerve-sparing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprised 231 patients with 
localized prostate cancer, who underwent surgery between February 2015 and 
February 2016. Surgery was performed using one of three approaches: 
laparoscopic, extraperitoneoscopic or robot-assisted. Nerve-sparing surgery was 
chosen were based on the Briganti nomogram (low risk of extraprostatic 
extension), Partins table, and taking into account the patients desire to 
maintain EF. EF and the quality of life were evaluated using the International 
Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire and the QoL (Quality of Life) 
scale.
RESULTS: Nerve-sparing RP was performed in 153 patients. Nerve-sparing RP did 
not differ significantly from non-nerve sparing RP with regard to operative time 
(p=0.064) and blood loss (p=0.073). According to the pathomorphological study, 
the prostatic capsule was intact, and surgical margins were negative in all 
cases. The incidence of significant ED and complete loss of erectile function 
was greater in patients after non-nerve sparing RP compared with nerve sparing 
RP [(5.0 (0-10.0) vs. 6.5 (0.8-19,0) points according to the IIEF-5 scale, 
p=0.271)]; 96.2% versus 72.2% (p<0.001). Nerve-sparing RP had a statistically 
significant better effect on the quality of life: 1.63+/-1.16 points against 
1.88+/-1.02 points (p=0.035).
CONCLUSION: The best outcomes were observed in patients undergoing 
robot-assisted RP. Nerve-sparing RP resulted in a lower rate of ED. This 
advantage without compromising the completeness of resection allows us to 
consider nerve-sparing RP as an appropriate and validated modality of preventing 
erectile dysfunction in properly selected patients.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading cause of premature mortality and morbidity. 
This study aimed at assessing the impact of smoking on life expectancy (LE) and 
LE with (LED) and without disability (DFLE). We further estimated the 
contribution of disability and mortality and their causes to differences in LED 
and DFLE by smoking.
METHODS: Data on disability, chronic conditions, and smoking from 17 148 
participants of the 1997, 2001, 2004 Belgian Health Interview Surveys were used 
to estimate causes of disability using the attribution method. A 10-year 
mortality follow-up of survey participants was used. The Sullivan method was 
applied to estimate LED and DFLE. The contribution of disability and mortality 
and of causes of disability and death to smoking differences in LED and DFLE was 
assessed using decomposition methods.
RESULTS: Never smokers live longer than daily smokers. DFLE advantage at age 15 
of +8.5/+4.3 years (y) in men/women never compared with daily smokers was the 
result of lower mortality (+6.2y/+3y) and lower disability (2.3y/1.3y). The 
extra 0.3y/1.6y LED in never smokers was due to lower mortality (+2.6y/+2.9y) 
and lower disability (-2.3y/-1.3y). Lower mortality from lung/larynx/trachea 
cancer, chronic respiratory, and ischaemic heart diseases was the main 
contributor to higher LED and DFLE in never smokers. Lower disability from 
musculoskeletal conditions in men and chronic respiratory diseases in women 
increased LED and DFLE in never smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and disability advantage among never smokers contributed 
to longer DFLE, while mortality advantage contributed to their longer LED.
