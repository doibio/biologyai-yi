BACKGROUND: Although cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) continues to be the 
gold standard, there are patient populations with higher failure rates with 
cemented TKAs such as the obese, morbidly obese, and younger active males. 
Cementless TKA usage continues to increase because of the potential benefits of 
long-term biologic fixation similar to the rise in cementless total hip 
arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and 
radiographic results of cementless TKA using a novel highly porous cementless 
tibial baseplate.
METHODS: This was a retrospective matched case-control study of 400 primary TKAs 
comparing cementless vs cemented TKAs using the same implant design (Stryker 
Triathlon; Stryker Inc, Mahwah, NJ). Two-hundred patients with a mean age of 64 
years (range 42-88 years) and body mass index (BMI) of 33.9 kg/m2 (range 
19.7-57.1 kg/m2) were matched to 200 primary cemented TKA patients with a mean 
age of 64 years (range 43-87 years) and BMI of 33.1 kg/m2 (range 22.2-53.2 
kg/m2). The mean follow-up in the cementless group was 2.4 years (range 2-3.5 
years) and in the cemented group was 5.3 years (range 2-10.9 years). Clinical 
and radiographic analyses were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed 
using the Microsoft Excel, version 15.21.1.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in age, BMI, and preoperative Knee 
Society Scores between the 2 groups (P = .22, P = .82, and P = .43, 
respectively). Patients in both groups had a similar incidence of postoperative 
complications (P = .90). Cementless group had 7 revisions with one aseptic 
loosening of the tibial component (0.5%). Cementless tibial baseplates 
demonstrated areas of increased bone density at the pegs of the tibial 
baseplate. The cemented group had 8 total revisions with 5 cases of aseptic 
loosening (2.5%).
CONCLUSION: Early results of cementless TKA using a highly porous tibial 
baseplate designed with a keel and 4 pegs appear promising with one case of 
aseptic loosening at minimum 2-year follow-up. As the demographics of patients 
undergoing TKA change to include younger, obese, and more active patients, along 
with increased life expectancy, the use of a highly porous cementless tibial 
baseplate may be beneficial in providing long-term durable biologic fixation 
similar to the success of cementless total hip arthroplasty.

BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of 
dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 
Our goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different durations of DAPT.
METHODS: We created a probabilistic patient-level Markov microsimulation model 
to assess the discounted lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
of short duration (3-6 months: short-duration group) vs standard therapy (12 
months: standard-duration group) vs prolonged therapy (30-36 months: 
long-duration group) in patients undergoing PCI.
RESULTS: The majority of patients in the model underwent PCI for stable angina 
(47.1%) with second-generation drug-eluting stents (62%) and were receiving 
clopidogrel (83.6%). Short-duration DAPT was the most effective strategy (7.163 
± 1.098 QALYs) compared with standard-duration DAPT (7.161 ± 1.097 QALYs) and 
long-duration DAPT (7.156 ± 1.097 QALYs). However, the magnitude of these 
differences was very small. Similarly, the average discounted lifetime cost was 
CAN$24,859 ± $6533 for short duration, $25,045 ± $6533 for standard duration, 
and $25,046 ± $6548 for long duration. Thus, in the base-case analysis, short 
duration was dominant, being more effective and less expensive. However, there 
was a moderate degree of uncertainty, because short duration was the preferred 
option in only ∼ 55% of simulations at a willingness to pay threshold of 
$50,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a stable angina cohort receiving clopidogrel with 
second-generation stents, a short duration of DAPT was marginally better. 
However, the differences are minimal, and decisions about duration of therapy 
should be driven by clinical data, patient risk of adverse events, including 
bleeding, and cardiovascular events.

BACKGROUND: Globally, the cost-effectiveness of spinal surgery is becoming 
increasingly important. However, these data are limited to a few countries. The 
purpose of our study was to examine the cost/quality adjusted life year 
(cost/QALY) gained for posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) in the Japanese 
universal health insurance system.
METHODS: Fifty five patients underwent PLIF for lumbar degenerative spinal canal 
stenosis between July 2013 and September 2015 was included. Effectiveness was 
measured using Euro QOL 5-dimension (EQ-5D), Short-Form 8 physical component 
summary (PCS), and visual analog scale (VAS). The cost was calculated from the 
perspective of the public healthcare payer. Effectiveness and cost were measured 
one year after surgery. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the utility value 
(EQ-5D) and life years. Only direct costs were included on the basis of actual 
reimbursements. Cost/QALY at a 5-year time horizon with a 2% discount rate was 
estimated. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the time horizon 
(2 years or 10 years). The exchange rate was defined as US $1 to Japanese 100 
yen.
RESULTS: Mean total cost one year after surgery was ￥2,802,900 ($28029). 
Operative cost was ￥1,779,700 ($17797). Mean gained score was 0.22 in EQ-5D, 
10.3 in PCS, and -44 in VAS. Cost/QALY was ￥2,697,500 ($26975). Sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that cost/QALY at a 10-year time horizon was ￥1,428,300 
($14283) and that cost/QALY at a 2-year time horizon was ￥6,435,400 ($64354).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes after PLIF improved beyond minimum clinical 
improvement difference. Cost/QALY was below the widely-accepted benchmark 
(cost/QALY < $50000). PLIF could be regarded as cost-effective interventions.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the growth and behavior of the ascending 
aorta in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease.
METHODS: We examined 200 patients with descending thoracic aortic disease 
including acute type B dissection (n = 95), chronic type B dissection (n = 38), 
intramural hematoma (n = 23), and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (n = 44). 
Images from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated 
after three-dimensional reconstruction to examine the growth rate in those with 
>1 year of imaging follow-up (n = 108). Survival data were derived from all 200 
patients in this study.
RESULTS: Average proximal aortic dimensions at the index image were relatively 
small, measuring 3.65 ± 0.51 cm in the root, 3.67 ± 0.48 cm in the ascending 
aorta, and 3.50 ± 0.44 cm in the proximal arch. Average growth rate was low for 
the aortic root, ascending aorta, and proximal arch at 0.36 ± 0.64 mm/y, 0.26 ± 
0.44 mm/y, and 0.25 ± 0.44 mm/y, respectively. There was no difference in 
baseline proximal aortic dimensions and growth rate between the four subgroups. 
An index aortic diameter ≥4.1 cm grew faster than those <4.1 cm at the ascending 
aorta (P = .028) and proximal arch (P = .019). There was no difference in aortic 
growth rates at the aortic root (P = .887). After the index scan, five patients 
underwent six ascending aortic replacement procedures, leading to a 3% ascending 
aortic intervention rate. Overall median life expectancy was 86.15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Native ascending aortic growth in patients with descending thoracic 
aortic disease is slow. We suggest regular follow-up for index ascending aorta 
≥4.1 cm because of its larger initial size and more rapid growth.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Total Hip Arthroplasty in Patients 80 Years of Age and 
Older.

Lebanon, New Hampshire.

BACKGROUND: This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of total hip 
arthroplasty (THA) in patients 80 years old.
METHODS: A Markov, state-transition model projecting lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was constructed to determine 
cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. Costs (in 2016 US dollars), 
health state utilities, and state transition probabilities were obtained from 
published literature. Primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to evaluate parameter assumptions.
RESULTS: At our base-case values, THA was cost-effective compared to 
non-operative treatment with a total lifetime accrued cost of $186,444 vs 
$182,732, and a higher lifetime accrued utility (5.60 vs 5.09). Cost per QALY 
for THA was $33,318 vs $35,914 for non-operative management, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $7307 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
THA to be cost-effective with a utility of successful primary THA above 0.67, a 
peri-operative mortality risk below 0.14, and a risk of primary THA failure 
below 0.14. Analysis further demonstrated that THA is a cost-effective option 
below a base-rate mortality threshold of 0.19, corresponding to the average 
base-rate mortality of a 93-year-old individual. Markov cohort analysis 
indicated that for patients undergoing THA at age 80 there was an approximate 
28% reduction in total lifetime long-term assisted living expenditure compared 
to non-operatively managed patients with end-stage hip osteoarthritis.
CONCLUSION: The results of our model demonstrate that THA is a cost-effective 
option compared to non-operative management in patients ≥80 years old. This 
analysis may inform policy regarding THA in elderly patients.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) imposes a substantial disease burden, predominantly from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), which accounts for >50% of deaths in this 
population and leads to a 12-year reduction in the life expectancy of a 
60-year-old male patient with T2D and CVD compared with the general population. 
The results from mandatory cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) are therefore 
of great interest in the field. The Academy for Cardiovascular Risk, Outcomes 
and Safety Studies in Type 2 Diabetes meeting program aims to bring together 
experts from several associated disciplines to provide fair and balanced 
resources for those involved in the management of patients with T2D. This 
publication represents the opinions of the faculty on the key learnings from the 
meeting held in Vienna in the spring of 2017. In particular, we detail how data 
from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® [cardiovascular outcomes trial of empagliflozin] and 
Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome 
Results (LEADER®) (liraglutide) CVOTs can be practically interpreted across 
clinical specialities. It is hoped that this translation of CVOT data will 
achieve a dual treatment paradigm for the management of both raised glucose 
levels and CV risk in patients with T2D.

AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of once-daily insulin 
degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) versus basal-bolus therapy in patients with type 
2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets on basal insulin from a healthcare payer 
perspective in Slovakia.
METHODS: Long-term clinical and economic outcomes for patients receiving 
IDegLira and basal-bolus therapy were estimated using the IMS CORE Diabetes 
Model based on a published pooled analysis of patient-level data.
RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with an improvement in quality-adjusted life 
expectancy of 0.29 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with basal-bolus 
therapy. The average lifetime cost per patient in the IDegLira arm was EUR 2,449 
higher than in the basal-bolus therapy arm. Increased treatment costs with 
IDegLira were partially offset by cost savings from avoided diabetes-related 
complications. IDegLira was highly cost-effective versus basal-bolus therapy 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 8,590 per QALY gained, which 
is well below the cost-effectiveness threshold set by the law in Slovakia.
CONCLUSION: IDegLira is cost-effective in Slovakia, providing a simple option 
for intensification of basal insulin therapy without increasing the risk of 
hypoglycemia or weight gain and with fewer daily injections than a basal-bolus 
regimen.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the risks of people on medication for 
schizophrenia developing different components of the metabolic syndrome and 
their life expectancy, through reference to a representative population of 
Australians without schizophrenia.
METHOD: Pharmacy payment-claim records from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 
were analyzed based on a representative 10% sample of Medicare numbers supplied 
by the Department of Human Services. Records were analyzed based on the date of 
supply of the prescription and the dataset included year of death information. 
Two major analyses were conducted for 9,533 people on medication for 
schizophrenia and a 1:1 sex/age matched control, followed for up to 7 years. 
Patient life expectancy was estimated by performing a Kaplan Meier survival 
analysis.
RESULTS: People on medication for schizophrenia compared to controls were 
1.91-times (95% CI = 1.66-2.21) and 1.28-times (95% CI = 1.15-1.43) more likely 
to start treatment for diabetes and hyperlipidemia, respectively, but were no 
more likely to start treatment for hypertension (hazard ratio = 0.87; 95% 
CI = 0.78-0.97). Overall, people on medication for schizophrenia were 1.32-times 
more likely to start treatment for one of these three comorbidities. Median life 
expectancy was assessed as 80 years for people on medication for schizophrenia, 
and 91 years for controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The results for this study confirm in a large representative 
Australian sample of people on medication for schizophrenia, an excess risk of 
components of the metabolic syndrome and early death.

Criteria used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to 
assess life-extending, end-of-life (EoL) treatments imply that health gains from 
such treatments are valued more than other health gains. Despite claims that the 
policy is supported by societal values, evidence from preference elicitation 
studies is mixed and in-depth research has shown there are different societal 
viewpoints. Few studies elicit preferences for policies directly or combine 
different approaches to understand preferences. Survey questions were designed 
to investigate support for NICE EoL guidance at national and regional levels. 
These 'Decision Rule' and 'Treatment Choice' questions were administered to an 
online sample of 1496 UK respondents in May 2014. The same respondents answered 
questions designed to elicit their agreement with three viewpoints (previously 
identified and described) in relation to provision of EoL treatments for 
terminally ill patients. We report the findings of these choice questions and 
examine how they relate to each other and respondents' viewpoints. The Decision 
Rule questions described three policies: DA - a standard 'value for money' test, 
applied to all health technologies; DB - giving special consideration to all 
treatments for terminal illnesses; and DC - giving special consideration to 
specific categories of treatments for terminal illnesses e.g. life extension (as 
in NICE EoL guidance) or those that improve quality-of-life (QoL). Three 
Treatment Choices were presented: TA - improving QoL for patients with a 
non-terminal illness; TB - extending life for EoL patients; and TC - improving 
QoL at the EoL. DC received most support (45%) with most respondents giving 
special consideration to EoL only when treatments improved QoL. The most 
commonly preferred treatment choices were TA (51%) and TC (43%). Overall, this 
study challenges claims about public support for NICE's EoL guidance and the 
focus on life extension at EoL and substantiates existing evidence of plurality 
in societal values.

'Fair innings' in the face of ageing and demographic change.

There are now 125 million people aged 80 years and over worldwide, projected by 
the United Nations to grow threefold by 2050. While increases in life expectancy 
and rapid increases in the older-age population are considered positive 
developments, the consequential future health care burden represents a leading 
concern for health services. We revisit Williams' 'fair innings' argument from 
1997, in light of technological and demographic changes, and challenge the 
notion that greater longevity may impose an unfair burden on younger 
generations. We discuss perspectives on the equity-efficiency trade-off in terms 
of their implications for the growing over-80 population, as well as society in 
general. This includes questioning the comparison of treatment 
cost-effectiveness in younger vs. older populations when using quality-adjusted 
life years and the transience of life expectancies over generations. While 
recognising that there will never be a clear consensus regarding societal value 
judgements, we present empirical evidence on the very elderly that lends support 
to a stronger anti-ageist stance given current increases in longevity.

The extension of comparative immunology to non-model systems, such as mollusks 
and annelids, has revealed an unexpected diversity in the complement of immune 
receptors and effectors among evolutionary lineages. However, several 
lophotrochozoan phyla remain unexplored mainly due to the lack of genomic 
resources. The increasing accessibility of high-throughput sequencing 
technologies offers unique opportunities for extending genome-wide studies to 
non-model systems. As a result, the genome-based study of the immune system in 
brachiopods allows a better understanding of the alternative survival strategies 
developed by these immunologically neglected phyla. Here we present a detailed 
overview of the molecular components of the immune system identified in the 
genome of the brachiopod Lingula anatina. Our findings reveal conserved 
intracellular signaling pathways as well as unique strategies for pathogen 
detection and killing in brachiopods.

PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the ability of oxygen uptake kinetics to 
predict short-term outcomes after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
METHODS: Fifty-two patients aged 60.9 ± 7.8 years waiting for off-pump coronary 
artery bypass surgery were evaluated. The 6-min walk test distance was performed 
pre-operatively, while simultaneously using a portable cardiopulmonary testing 
device. The transition of oxygen uptake kinetics from rest to exercise was 
recorded to calculate oxygen uptake kinetics fitting a monoexponential 
regression model. Oxygen uptake at steady state, constant time, and mean 
response time corrected by work rate were analysed. Short-term clinical outcomes 
were evaluated during the early post-operative of off-pump coronary artery 
bypass surgery.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed body mass index, surgery time, and mean 
response time corrected by work rate as independent predictors for short-term 
outcomes. The optimal mean response time corrected by work rate cut-off to 
estimate short-term clinical outcomes was 1.51 × 10-3 min2/ml. Patients with 
slower mean response time corrected by work rate demonstrated higher rates of 
hypertension, diabetes, EuroSCOREII, left ventricular dysfunction, and impaired 
6-min walk test parameters. The per cent-predicted distance threshold of 66% in 
the pre-operative was associated with delayed oxygen uptake kinetics.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative oxygen uptake kinetics during 6-min walk test 
predicts short-term clinical outcomes after off-pump coronary artery bypass 
surgery. From a clinically applicable perspective, a threshold of 66% of 
pre-operative predicted 6-min walk test distance indicated slower kinetics, 
which leads to longer intensive care unit and post-surgery hospital length of 
stay. Implications for rehabilitation Coronary artery bypass grafting is a 
treatment aimed to improve expectancy of life and prevent disability due to the 
disease progression; The use of pre-operative submaximal functional capacity 
test enabled the identification of patients with high risk of complications, 
where patients with delayed oxygen uptake kinetics exhibited worse short-term 
outcomes; Our findings suggest the importance of the rehabilitation in the 
pre-operative in order to "pre-habilitate" the patients to the surgical 
procedure; Faster oxygen uptake on-kinetics could be achieved by improving the 
oxidative capacity of muscles and cardiovascular conditioning through 
rehabilitation, adding better results following cardiac surgery.

Because life tables are capable of providing the most comprehensive description 
on the survival, stage differentiation, and the reproduction of animal 
populations, they can be considered as the bases of population ecology and pest 
management. Researchers concerned with studies involving life tables inevitably 
face the problem of describing the variabilities that occur in the survival, 
stage differentiation, and fecundity data. Finding a means to include these 
variabilities in population projections concerning pest management may be 
problematic. Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata (F.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) 
is a pest of many plant species in Asia, including cultivated crops, 
ornamentals, and wild plants. The raw life history data (survival, stage 
differentiation, and fecundity) and consumption rate of both sexes of H. 
vigintioctopunctata reared on Solanum photeinocarpum Nakamura et Odashima 
(Solanales: Solanaceae) were collected in the laboratory and analyzed based on 
the age-stage, two-sex life table theory. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), 
finite rate of increase (λ), net reproductive rate (R0), mean generation time 
(T), and net consumption rate (C0) of H. vigintioctopunctata were 0.1312 d-1, 
1.1402 d-1, 603.5 offspring, 48.8 d, and 77.8 cm2, respectively. By using the 
bootstrap technique with 100,000 samples, we demonstrated that the life tables 
constructed based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of R0 and λ can be used to 
describe the variabilities found in the survival and fecundity curves and to 
project the uncertainty of population growth.

Adolescent obesity is a major health issue facing today's youth. This may be the 
first generation to have a lower life expectancy than their parents. The Youth 
Empowerment Implementation Project's (YEIP) goal was to increase fruit and 
vegetable intake, lower junk food consumption, and increase physical activity 
among low-income African-American youth living in the Midwest. Thirty middle 
school aged youth participated in an evidenced-based program (i.e., Botvin's 
Life Skills Training) and were engaged in health education and physical 
activities. The results from baseline to follow-up demonstrated a reduction in 
junk food intake for participants and an increase in fruit and vegetable intake 
but not for physical activity. The health behaviors of participants improved for 
three out of four indicators following the intervention. Limitations, future 
research, and implications for future programs are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is the 
leading cause of heart failure in Latin America. The clinical treatment of 
Chagas disease is limited to two 60 year-old drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, 
that have variable efficacy against different strains of the parasite and may 
lead to severe side effects. CYP51 is an enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis 
pathway that has been exploited for the development of therapeutics for fungal 
and parasitic infections. In a target-based drug discovery program guided by 
x-ray crystallography, we identified the 4-aminopyridyl-based series of CYP51 
inhibitors as being efficacious versus T.cruzi in vitro; two of the most potent 
leads, 9 and 12, have now been evaluated for toxicity and efficacy in mice.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both acute and chronic animal models infected 
with wild type or transgenic T. cruzi strains were evaluated. There was no 
evidence of toxicity in the 28-day dosing study of uninfected animals, as judged 
by the monitoring of multiple serum and histological parameters. In two acute 
models of Chagas disease, 9 and 12 drastically reduced parasitemia, increased 
survival of mice, and prevented liver and heart injury. None of the compounds 
produced long term sterile cure. In the less severe acute model using the 
transgenic CL-Brenner strain of T.cruzi, parasitemia relapsed upon drug 
withdrawal. In the chronic model, parasitemia fell to a background level and, as 
evidenced by the bioluminescence detection of T. cruzi expressing the 
red-shifted luciferase marker, mice remained negative for 4 weeks after drug 
withdrawal. Two immunosuppression cycles with cyclophosphamide were required to 
re-activate the parasites. Although no sterile cure was achieved, the 
suppression of parasitemia in acutely infected mice resulted in drastically 
reduced inflammation in the heart.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The positive outcomes achieved in the absence of 
sterile cure suggest that the target product profile in anti-Chagasic drug 
discovery should be revised in favor of safe re-administration of the medication 
during the lifespan of a Chagas disease patient. A medication that reduces 
parasite burden may halt or slow progression of cardiomyopathy and therefore 
improve both life expectancy and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: With continuous progress over the past few decades in understanding 
diagnosis, treatment, and genetics, much has been learned about the prostate 
cancer-diagnosed genome.
METHODS: A comprehensive MEDLINE® and Google scholar literature search was 
conducted using keyword variations relating to the genetics of prostate cancer 
such as chromosomal alterations, androgen receptor, castration-resistant, 
inheritance, polymorphisms, oncogenes, metastasis, biomarkers, and 
immunotherapy.
RESULTS: Traditionally, androgen receptors (AR) have been the focus of research. 
Recently, identification of recurrent chromosomal alterations that lead to 
either multiplication of regions (gain-of-function) or deletion of regions 
(loss-of-function) has opened the door to greater genetic accessibility. These 
chromosomal aberrations lead to variation in copy number and gene expression. 
Some of these chromosomal alterations are inherited, while others undergo 
somatic mutations during disease progression. Inherited gene mutations that make 
one susceptible to prostate cancer have been identified with familial-linked 
studies. Somatic genes that progress tumorigenesis have also been identified. 
Research on the molecular biology of prostate cancer has characterized these 
genes into tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Additionally, genome-wide assay 
studies have identified many high-risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms recurrent 
throughout the prostate cancer-diagnosed genome. Castration-resistant prostate 
cancer is the most aggressive form of prostate cancer, and its research has 
elucidated many types of mutations associated with AR itself, including enhanced 
expression and amplification, point mutations, and alternative splicing. 
Understanding the molecular biology of prostate cancer has permitted more 
accurate identification using advanced biomarkers and therapy for aggressive 
forms using immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: An age-related disease, prostate cancer commands profound 
attention. With increasing life expectancy and the continuous pursuit of it, 
prostate cancer is a powerful obstacle best defeated using targeted therapies 
specifically designed for the unique molecular profile of the malignancy.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease characterized by joint 
destruction, deformity, lower functionality, and decrease in life expectancy. 
Wingless signaling pathway (Wnt) has been recently involved in bone homeostasis. 
Studies suggest that overexpression of the pathway inhibitors, like the Dickkopf 
1 protein (DKK1), has been implicated in bone destruction. The objective of this 
study is to compare circulating levels of DKK1 in different groups of patients 
with disease activity (remission, low, moderate, high activity,) and 
functionality status. Three hundred seventy-nine patients with RA were evaluated 
between March 2015 and November 2016. Disease activity was evaluated by disease 
activity score 28 with C-reactive protein (DAS28CPR), simplified and clinical 
disease activity scores (SDAI, CDAI), routine assessment of patient index data 3 
(RAPID3), functional status using Multidimensional Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (MD-HAQ), and the Steinbrocker functional classification. DKK1 
levels were measured by ELISA. The mean age was 60.7 ± 13.9 years. Disease 
duration was 13.2 ± 10.9 years. Higher levels of DKK1 were not associated with 
disease activity by CDAI (p = 0.70), SDAI (p = 0.84), DAS28CRP (p = 0.80), or 
RAPID3 (p = 0.70). Interestingly higher levels of DKK1 were significantly 
associated to lower functional status evaluating by the Steinbrocker 
classification (p = 0,013), severe disability by MD-HAQ (p = 0,004), and 
variables associated with joint destruction like osteoporosis, higher titles of 
rheumatoid factor, smoking, and increased hospital admissions related to RA. 
Higher levels of DKK1 were found in patients with lower functional status. This 
association was not found in patients with greater disease activity by CDAI, 
SDAI, DAS28, and RAPID3. This could be explained by more structural damage; DKK1 
could be used as a biomarker of joint destruction in RA.

The cost of generating a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) within a National 
Health Service provides an approximation of the average opportunity cost of 
funding decisions. This information can be used to inform a cost-effectiveness 
threshold. The aim of this paper is to estimate the cost per QALY at the Spanish 
National Health Service. We exploit variation across 17 regional health services 
and the exogenous changes in expenditure that took place as a consequence of the 
economic crisis over 5 years of data. We conduct fixed effect models and use an 
instrumental variable approach to test for potential remaining endogeneity. Our 
results show that health expenditure has a positive and significant effect on 
population health, with an average spending elasticity of 0.07. This translates 
into a cost per QALY of between 22,000€ and 25,000€. These values are below the 
cost-effectiveness threshold figure of 30,000€ commonly cited in Spain.

[Gasotransmitters: Physiological Role and Involvement in the Pathogenesis of the 
Diseases].

[Article in Russian]

Sukmansky OI, Reutov VP.

In recent decades, it has been found the existence of a new class of 
biologically active substances - gaseous mediators (gasotransmitters), 
performing in the cells the signaling function and with high specificity 
involved in the intercellular and intracellular communication. This review 
characterizes the main gasotransmitters: nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen 
sulfide, sulfur dioxide and polysulfides. Their physiological role and 
involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases is described. Basic information 
about main gasotransmitters is generalized in the original table. 
Nitrate-Nitrite background, which is a chemical background of the existence of 
modern man, affects the intra- and intercellular signaling system, alters the 
ultrastructure of neurons, neuron-neuron and neuron-glia interaction, eliminates 
the effects of endogenous gasotransmitters and affects the average life 
expectancy. In accordance with the principle of cyclicity is proposed and 
substantiated the hypothesis of the existence of “hydrogen sulfide cycle”, 
combining three sulfur-containing gasotransmitters. It is suggested that the 
cyclic organization of gasotransmitters in the cells and the whole body can be 
due to the existence of a global principle of cyclicity, which can spread its 
influence on almost all the structural and functional levels in the animate and 
inanimate nature.

[Molecular Mechanisms of Action of Gas Transmitters NO, CO and H2S in Smooth 
Muscle Cells and Effect of NO-generating Compounds (Nitrates and Nitrites) on 
Average Life Expectancy].

[Article in Russian]

VP.

Gaseous signaling molecules (gas transmitters) take an especial position among 
the numerous signaling molecules involved in the regulation of both 
intracellular processes that occur in different types of cells and cell-cell 
interactions. At present time, gas transmitters include three molecules whose 
enzymatic systems of synthesis and degradation, physiological action and 
intracellular effectors, the change of which under the action of gas 
transmitters may result in physiological and/or pathophysiological effects are 
well- determined. These molecules include nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide 
(CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). They are involved in the regulation of 
functions of various organs and systems of the human body, including the 
circulatory system. Interaction of NO, CO and H2S with various enzymatic and 
structural components of endothelial and, especially, smooth muscle cells has a 
significant impact on vascular tone and blood pressure. Furthermore, the 
crossing of NO-, CO- and H2S-mediated signaling pathways at common effectors and 
interaction with each other can determine the end, resulting functional response 
of the cell. The knowledge of the molecular targets of gas transmitters' action, 
the structure of the binding centers for gas transmitters and their interaction 
with each other may be essential in the development of methods of regulation of 
these signaling systems by targeted, directed action. This review summarizes the 
molecular mechanisms of the NO, CO and H2S interaction with the main targets, 
which carry out their regulatory effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. Also we 
describe here different ways of cross-regulation of NO-, CO- and H2S-dependent 
signaling pathways. We analyzed NO-synthase and nitrite reductase systems of 
nitric oxide cycle and discuss the nitrate-nitrite background of the existence 
of modern man, which can substantially modify the signaling system, the 
metabolism of virtually all cell ultrastructure of neurons, neuron-neuron and 
neuron-glial interactions and exerts its influence on socially significant 
diseases that can affect the quality and the average life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Student Run Clinics (SRCs) are a common aspect of medical education, 
present at more than half of US medical schools, and noted for providing care to 
communities that might otherwise lack access, including the uninsured and 
underinsured. To date, few studies have rigorously quantified the health and 
economic benefits of SRCs, and the present study remedies that.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the health 
impact of common preventive health interventions applied to individuals in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We then used those measurements to estimate
