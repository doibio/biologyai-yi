BACKGROUND: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema 
pallidum, and the infection source is syphilis patients. This study aimed to 
estimate the incidence, mortality rate, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of syphilis to improve the understanding of the current global situation 
of syphilis.
METHODS: This study collected data on syphilis incidence, mortality, and DALYs 
from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease database.
RESULTS: The global number of incident cases and age-standardized incidence rate 
(ASIR) increased from 8,845,220 (95% UI: 6,562,510-11,588,860) in 1990 to 
14,114,110 (95% UI: 10,648,490-18,415,970) in 2019 and 160.03/100,000 persons 
(95% UI: 120.66-208.1) to 178.48/100,000 persons (95% UI: 134.94-232.34), 
respectively. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the ASIR was 0.16 
(95% CI: 0.07-0.26). The EAPC in the ASIR associated with high and high-middle 
sociodemographic indices increased. The ASIR increased among males but decreased 
among females, and the incidence peaked among males and females between the ages 
of 20 and 30 years. The EAPCs in the age-standardized death rate and 
age-standardized DALY rate decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and ASIR of syphilis increased worldwide from 1990 to 
2019. Only the regions with high and high-middle sociodemographic indices showed 
an increase in the ASIR. Moreover, the ASIR increased among males but decreased 
among females. The age-standardized death rate and DALY rate both declined 
worldwide. The increase in the global ASIR of syphilis is a challenge.

BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency accompanied 
by frequency and nocturia, with or without urge urinary incontinence (UUI). 
Vibegron, a selective β3-adrenergic receptor agonist approved in the US in 
December 2020, demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms of OAB and was safe 
and well tolerated in the 12-week EMPOWUR trial and its 40-week, double-blind 
extension trial. The goal of the COMPOSUR study is to evaluate vibegron in a 
real-world setting to assess patient treatment satisfaction, tolerability, 
safety, duration of treatment, and persistence.
METHODS: This is a 12-month, prospective, observational, real-world study, with 
an optional 12-month extension to 24 months, in the US assessing 
adults ≥ 18 years old starting a new course of vibegron. Patients must be 
previously diagnosed with OAB with or without UUI, symptomatic for ≥ 3 months 
before enrollment, and receive prior treatment with an anticholinergic, with 
mirabegron, or with a combination of an anticholinergic and mirabegron. 
Enrollment is performed by the investigator following exclusion and inclusion 
criteria guided by US product labeling, reinforcing a real-world approach. 
Patients complete the OAB Satisfaction with Treatment Questionnaire (OAB-SAT-q) 
monthly and the OAB Questionnaire short form (OAB-q-SF) and Work Productivity 
and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI:US) at baseline and monthly for 
12 months. Patients are followed up via phone call, in-person visits, or 
telehealth (ie, virtual) visits. The primary endpoint is patient treatment 
satisfaction as determined by the OAB-SAT-q satisfaction domain score. Secondary 
endpoints include percent positive responses to individual OAB-SAT-q questions, 
additional OAB-SAT-q domain scores, and safety. Exploratory endpoints include 
adherence and persistence.
DISCUSSION: OAB leads to a significant decrease in quality of life, as well as 
impairment of work activities and productivity. Persistence with OAB treatments 
can be challenging, often due to lack of efficacy and adverse effects. COMPOSUR 
is the first study to provide long-term, prospective, pragmatic treatment data 
for vibegron in the US and the resultant effect on quality of life among 
patients with OAB in a real-world clinical setting. Trial registration 
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05067478; registered: October 5, 2021.

BACKGROUND: Hospital admissions are common in the last phase of life. However, 
palliative care and advance care planning (ACP) are provided late or not at all 
during hospital admission.
AIM: To provide insight into the perceptions of in-hospital healthcare 
professionals concerning current and ideal practice and roles of in-hospital 
palliative care and advance care planning.
METHODS: An electronic cross-sectional survey was send 398 in-hospital 
healthcare professionals in five hospitals in the Netherlands. The survey 
contained 48 items on perceptions of palliative care and ACP.
RESULTS: We included non-specialists who completed the questions of interest, 
resulting in analysis of 96 questionnaires. Most respondents were nurses (74%). 
We found that current practice for initiating palliative care and ACP was 
different to what is considered ideal practice. Ideally, ACP should be initiated 
for almost every patient for whom no treatment options are available (96.2%), 
and in case of progression and severe symptoms (94.2%). The largest differences 
between current and ideal practice were found for patients with functional 
decline (Current 15.2% versus Ideal 78.5%), and patients with an estimated life 
expectancy <1 year (Current 32.6% versus ideal 86.1%). Respondents noted that 
providing palliative care requires collaboration, however, especially nurses 
noted barriers like a lack of inter-professional consensus.
CONCLUSIONS: The differences between current and ideal practice demonstrate that 
healthcare professionals are willing to improve palliative care. To do this, 
nurses need to increase their voice, a shared vision of palliative care and 
recognition of the added value of working together is needed.

OBJECTIVE: This article estimates the disease burden of 5q-SMA in Colombia by 
using the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) metric.
METHODS: Epidemiological data were obtained from local databases and medical 
literature and were adjusted in the DisMod II tool. DALYs were obtained by 
adding years of life lost due to premature death (YLL) and years lived with 
disability (YLD).
RESULTS: The modeled prevalence of 5q-SMA in Colombia was 0.74 per 100,000 
population. The fatality rate for all types was 14.1%. The disease burden of 
5q-SMA was estimated at 4,421 DALYs (8.6 DALYs/100,000), corresponding to 4,214 
(95.3%) YLLs and 207 (4.7%) YLDs. Most of the DALYs were accounted in the 2-17 
age group. Of the total burden, 78% correspond to SMA type 1, 18% to type 2, and 
4% to type 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Although 5q-SMA is a rare disease, it is linked to a significant 
disease burden due to premature mortality and severe sequelae. The estimates 
shown in this article are important inputs to inform public policy decisions on 
how to ensure adequate health service provision for patients with 5q-SMA.

Obesity as a Main Threat to Future Improvements in Population Health: Policy 
Opportunities and Challenges.

Branch.

Policy Points Obesity has emerged as a main threat to future improvements in 
population health, and there is little evidence that the epidemic is retreating. 
The traditional model of "calories in, calories out," which has guided public 
health policy for decades, is increasingly viewed as far too simple a framing to 
explain the evolution of the epidemic or guide public policy. Advances in the 
science of obesity, coming from many fields, highlight the structural nature of 
the risk, which has provided an evidence base to justify and guide policies 
toward addressing the social and environmental drivers of obesity. Societies and 
researchers need to play the long game in that widespread reductions in obesity 
in the short run are unlikely. Nonetheless, there are opportunities. Policies 
specifically targeting the food environment such as taxing high-calorie 
beverages and foods, restricting the marketing of junk foods to children, 
enhancing food labeling, and improving the dietary environment at schools may 
yield long-run benefits.

The Politics of Population Health.

Dawes D(1), Gonzalez J(1).

Author information:

Health Equity.

Policy Points Despite increased spending and consuming more health care services 
than any other country in the world, the United States global health rankings 
experience continued decline, including worsening performance in life expectancy 
and mortality owing to lack of investment in and strategies on the upstream 
determinants of health. These determinants of health are found in our access to 
adequate, affordable, and nutritious food options; safe housing, blue and green 
spaces; reliable and safe transportation; education and literacy; opportunities 
for economic stability; and sanitation, among other important factors and all 
share a common root driver in the political determinants of health. Health 
systems are increasingly investing in programs and exerting influence over 
policies to address these upstream determinants of health, including population 
health management, however these programs will continue to be hindered without 
addressing the political determinants through government, voting, and policy. 
Although these investments are laudable, it is important to understand what 
gives rise to the social determinants of health and-more importantly-why have 
they disproportionately and detrimentally affected historically marginalized 
communities and vulnerable populations for so long? Deeply entrenched and 
pervasive throughout society, the political determinants of health are the 
fundamental instigators of these unjust and inequitable outcomes.

Optimising the current model of care for knee osteoarthritis with the 
implementation of guideline recommended non-surgical treatments: a model-based 
health economic evaluation.

Physiotherapy, Bern, Switzerland.

Brussels, Belgium.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: Structured exercise, education, weight management and 
painkiller prescription are guideline recommended non-surgical treatments for 
patients suffering from knee osteoarthritis. Despite its endorsement, uptake of 
guideline recommended non-surgical treatments remains low. It is unknown whether 
the implementation of these treatments into the current model of care for knee 
osteoarthritis would be cost-effective from a Swiss statutory healthcare 
perspective. We therefore aimed to (1) assess the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of an optimised model of care incorporating guideline recommended 
non-surgical treatments in adults with knee osteoarthritis and (2) the effect of 
total knee replacement (TKR) delay with guideline recommended non-surgical 
treatments on the cost-effectiveness of the overall model of care.
METHODS: A Markov model from the Swiss statutory healthcare perspective was used 
to compare an optimised model of care incorporating guideline recommended 
non-surgical treatments versus the current model of care without standardised 
guideline recommended non-surgical treatments. Costs were derived from two Swiss 
health insurers, a national database, and a reimbursement catalogue. Utility 
values and transition probabilities were extracted from clinical trials and 
national population data. The main outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for three scenarios: "base case" (current model of care 
vs optimised model of care with no delay of total knee replacement), "two-year 
delay" (current model of care vs optimised model of care + two-year delay of 
total knee replacement) and "five-year delay" (current model of care vs 
optimised model of care + five-year delay of total knee replacement). Costs and 
utilities were discounted at 3% per year and a time horizon of 70 years was 
chosen. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The "base case" scenario led to 0.155 additional quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) per person at an additional cost per person of CHF 341 (ICER = CHF 
2,203 / QALY gained). The "two-year delay" scenario led to 0.134 additional 
QALYs and CHF -14 cost per person. The "five-year delay" scenario led to 0.118 
additional QALYs and CHF -501 cost per person. Delay of total knee replacement 
by two and five years led to an 18% and 36% reduction of revision surgeries, 
respectively, and had a cost-saving effect.
CONCLUSION: According to this Markov model, the optimisation of the current 
model of care by implementing guideline recommended non-surgical treatments 
would likely be cost-effective from a statutory healthcare perspective. If 
implementing guideline recommended non-surgical treatments delays total knee 
replacement by two or five years, the amount of revision surgeries may be 
reduced.

With increasing life expectancy, the prevalence of dementia is increasing 
worldwide. Dementia is among the greatest challenges for healthcare and social 
systems of the future. Approximately 40% of newly diagnosed cases of dementia 
are associated with risk factors that can potentially be influenced by 
preventive measures. Based on the evidence from longitudinal studies, systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses, the Lancet commission on dementia prevention, 
intervention and care has defined 12 risk factors that are associated with an 
increased risk for dementia: low level of education, hearing impairment, 
traumatic brain injury, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, 
excessive alcohol consumption, depression, obesity, social isolation, and air 
pollution.

zurückführen, die potenziell durch präventive Maßnahmen beeinflussbar sind. Die 
Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care hat auf Basis 
der Evidenz aus longitudinalen Studien, systematischen Reviews und Metaanalysen 
12 Risikofaktoren definiert, die mit einem erhöhten Risiko für Demenz assoziiert

Transgenic soybean is the commercial crop with the largest cultivation area 
worldwide. During transgenic soybean cultivation, exogenous genes may be 
transferred to wild relatives through gene flow, posing unpredictable ecological 
risks. Accordingly, an environmental risk assessment should focus on fitness 
changes and underlying mechanisms in hybrids between transgenic and wild 
soybeans (Glycine soja). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass 
spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used for in situ detection and imaging of 
protein changes in the seeds of transgenic herbicide-resistant soybean harboring 
epsps and pat genes, non-transgenic soybean, wild soybean, and their F2 hybrid. 
Protein data clearly distinguished wild soybeans, while the F2 seeds had protein 
characteristics of both parents and were distinguished from wild soybean seeds. 
Using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, 22 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were 
identified, including 13 specific to wild soybean. Sucrose synthase and stress 
response-related DEPs were differentially expressed in parental and offspring. 
Differences in these may underpin the greater adaptability of the latter. MSI 
revealed DEP distribution in transgenic, wild, and F2 seeds. Identifying DEPs 
related to fitness may elucidate mechanisms underlying fitness differences among 
the studied varieties. Our study shows that MALDI-MSI has the potential to 
become a visual method for transgenic soybean analysis.

BACKGROUND: The East North Central Census division (aka the Great Lakes region) 
experienced a decrease in life expectancy of 0.3 years from 2014 to 2016 - one 
of the largest declines across the nine Census divisions. Disadvantaged groups 
that typically have below-average life expectancy, including Black individuals 
and those without a college education, may have been disproportionately affected 
by this longevity shift. This investigation examines life expectancy changes 
among different sex, race, and education groups in the Great Lakes region, and 
how specific causes of death contributed to within-group longevity changes over 
time and across age.
METHODS: We used 2008 to 2017 death counts from the National Center for Health 
Statistics and American Community Survey population estimates to measure 
within-group change in life expectancy at age 25 among non-Hispanic Black and 
white males and females by educational attainment. We decomposed life expectancy 
change over time for each subgroup by 24 causes of death and measured their 
contribution to longevity change across 13 age groups.
RESULTS: Among persons with ≤ 12 years of education, white males and females 
experienced 1.3- and 1.7-year longevity declines respectively, compared to a 
0.6-year decline among Black males and a 0.3-year decline among Black females. 
Life expectancy declined among all groups with 13-15 years of education, but 
especially Black females, who experienced a 2.2-year loss. With the exception of 
Black males, all groups with 16 + years of education experienced longevity 
gains. Homicide contributed 0.34 years to longevity decline among Black males 
with ≤ 12 years of education. Drug poisoning made large contributions to 
longevity losses among Black females with ≤ 12 years of education (0.31 years), 
white males and females with 13-15 years of education (0.35 and 0.21 years, 
respectively), and white males and females with ≤ 12 years of education (0.92 
and 0.65 years, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Public health efforts to reduce the risks of homicide among Black 
males without a college education and drug poisoning among all groups could 
improve life expectancy and reduce racial and educational longevity disparities 
in the Great Lakes region.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes can capture domains that are meaningful to 
patients, such as life engagement in major depressive disorder (MDD), which 
reflects life fulfillment, well-being, and participation in valued and 
meaningful activities. This analysis investigated the effects of brexpiprazole 
adjunct to antidepressant treatment (ADT) on patient life engagement over the 
short and long term, using the 10-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 
Self-Report (IDS-SR10) Life Engagement subscale.
METHODS: Short-term data were pooled from three 6-week, randomized, double-blind 
studies of ADT + brexpiprazole 2-3 mg/day versus ADT + placebo in adult 
outpatients with MDD (DSM-IV-TR criteria) and inadequate response to ADTs. 
Long-term data were from a 26-52-week, open-label extension study of 
ADT + brexpiprazole 0.5-3 mg/day.
RESULTS: Over 6 weeks, ADT + brexpiprazole (n = 579) showed greater improvement 
in IDS-SR10 Life Engagement subscale score than ADT + placebo (n = 583), with a 
least squares mean difference of -1.19 (95% confidence limits: -1.78, -0.59; 
p = 0.0001; Cohen's d effect size: 0.23). Greater improvement for 
ADT + brexpiprazole versus ADT + placebo (p < 0.05) was also observed on eight 
life engagement items, with effect sizes ranging from 0.12 to 0.24. In the 
long-term study, mean (standard deviation) IDS-SR10 Life Engagement subscale 
score changed by -2.4 (4.9) points to Week 26 (n = 2047), and -3.7 (5.3) points 
to Week 52 (n = 768), with mean improvements on all ten items.
CONCLUSIONS: Beyond its efficacy on depressive symptoms, adjunctive 
brexpiprazole may improve patient life engagement, thereby helping patients with 
MDD to achieve personally meaningful functional outcomes.

Climate change can directly (physiology) and indirectly (novel species 
interactions) modify species responses to novel environmental conditions during 
the initial stages of range shifts. Whilst the effects of climate warming on 
tropical species at their cold-water leading ranges are well-established, it 
remains unclear how future seasonal temperature changes, ocean acidification, 
and novel species interactions will alter the physiology of range-shifting 
tropical and competing temperate fish in recipient ecosystems. Here we used a 
laboratory experiment to examine how ocean acidification, future summer vs 
winter temperatures, and novel species interactions could affect the physiology 
of competing temperate and range-extending coral reef fish to determine 
potential range extension outcomes. In future winters (20 °C + elevated pCO2) 
coral reef fish at their cold-water leading edges showed reduced physiological 
performance (lower body condition and cellular defence, and higher oxidative 
damage) compared to present-day summer (23 °C + control pCO2) and future summer 
conditions (26 °C + elevated pCO2). However, they showed a compensatory effect 
in future winters through increased long-term energy storage. Contrastingly, 
co-shoaling temperate fish showed higher oxidative damage, and reduced 
short-term energy storage and cellular defence in future summer than in future 
winter conditions at their warm-trailing edges. However, temperate fish 
benefitted from novel shoaling interactions and showed higher body condition and 
short-term energy storage when shoaling with coral reef fish compared to 
same-species shoaling. We conclude that whilst during future summers, ocean 
warming will likely benefit coral reef fishes extending their ranges, future 
winter conditions may still reduce coral reef fish physiological functioning, 
and may therefore slow their establishment at higher latitudes. In contrast, 
temperate fish species benefit from co-shoaling with smaller-sized tropical 
fishes, but this benefit may dissipate due to their reduced physiological 
functioning under future summer temperatures and increasing body sizes of 
co-shoaling tropical species.

Although air pollutions cause human diseases, no epidemiological study has 
investigated the effect of exposure to air pollutants on brain diseases in the 
general population. Our objective was to examine the association between 
tropospheric airborne pollutants and human health risk and global burden, 
especially, attributable to indoor formaldehyde (FA) pollution in China. The 
data of tropospheric pollutants, such as: CO, NO, O3, PM2.5 or PM10, SO2, and FA 
in China, 2013-2019, which were derived from the database of satellite 
remote-sensing, were first calculated and then analyzed them according to 
satellite cloud pictures. The rate of prevalence, incidence, deaths, years of 
life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) of the Chinese population was obtained from the Global Burden 
of Diseases (GBD 2010). A linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the 
relationship between tropospheric FA concentrations and GBD indexes of human 
brain diseases, the numbers of fire plot, the average summer temperature, 
population density and car sales in China from 2013 to 2019. Our results showed 
that the levels of tropospheric FA could reflect the degree of indoor air FA 
pollution on a nationwide scale in China; in particular, only tropospheric FA 
exhibited a positive correlation with the rates of both prevalence and YLDs in 
brain diseases including: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and brain cancer, but not in 
Parkinson's disease and depression. In particular, the spatial-temporal changes 
in tropospheric FA levels were consistent with the geographical distribution of 
FA exposure-induced AD and brain cancer in both sex old adults with age (60-89). 
In addition, summer average temperature, car sales and population density were 
positively correlated with tropospheric FA levels in China, 2013-2019. Hence, 
mapping of tropospheric pollutants could be used for air quality monitoring and 
health risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women with an 
incidence of around 6.5 % of all the cancer in women worldwide. Early detection 
and adequate treatment according to staging improve the patient's life 
expectancy. Outcome prediction models might aid treatment decisions, but a 
systematic review on prediction models for cervical cancer patients is not 
available.
DESIGN: We performed a systematic review for prediction models in cervical 
cancer following PRISMA guidelines. Key features that were used for model 
training and validation, the endpoints were extracted from the article and data 
were analyzed. Selected articles were grouped based on prediction endpoints i.e. 
Group1: Overall survival, Group2: progression-free survival; Group3: recurrence 
or distant metastasis; Group4: treatment response; Group5: toxicity or quality 
of life. We developed a scoring system to evaluate the manuscript. As per our 
criteria, studies were divided into four groups based on scores obtained in our 
scoring system, the Most significant study (Score > 60 %); Significant study 
(60 % > Score > 50 %); Moderately Significant study (50 % > Score > 40 %); least 
significant study (score < 40 %). A meta-analysis was performed for all the 
groups separately.
RESULTS: The first line of search selected 1358 articles and finally 39 articles 
were selected as eligible for inclusion in the review. As per our assessment 
criteria, 16, 13 and 10 studies were found to be the most significant, 
significant and moderately significant respectively. The intra-group pooled 
correlation coefficient for Group1, Group2, Group3, Group4, and Group5 were 0.76 
[0.72, 0.79], 0.80 [0.73, 0.86], 0.87 [0.83, 0.90], 0.85 [0.77, 0.90], 0.88 
[0.85, 0.90] respectively. All the models were found to be good (prediction 
accuracy [c-index/AUC/R2] >0.7) in endpoint prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: Prediction models of cervical cancer toxicity, local or distant 
recurrence and survival prediction show promising results with reasonable 
prediction accuracy [c-index/AUC/R2 > 0.7]. These models should also be 
validated on external data and evaluated in prospective clinical studies.

BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis treatment should consider risks and benefits for 
lifetime management. Although the feasibility of redo transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) remains unclear, concerns are emerging regarding reoperation 
after TAVR.
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to define comparative risk of surgical aortic 
valve replacement (SAVR) after prior TAVR or SAVR.
METHODS: Data on patients undergoing bioprosthetic SAVR after TAVR and/or SAVR 
were extracted from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database (2011-2021). 
Overall and isolated SAVR cohorts were analyzed. The primary outcome was 
operative mortality. Risk adjustment using hierarchical logistic regression as 
well as propensity score matching for isolated SAVR cases were performed.
RESULTS: Of 31,106 SAVR patients, 1,126 had prior TAVR (TAVR-SAVR), 674 had 
prior SAVR and TAVR (SAVR-TAVR-SAVR), and 29,306 had prior SAVR (SAVR-SAVR). 
Yearly rates of TAVR-SAVR and SAVR-TAVR-SAVR increased over time, whereas 
SAVR-SAVR was stable. The TAVR-SAVR patients were older, with higher acuity, and 
with greater comorbidities than other cohorts. The unadjusted operative 
mortality was highest in the TAVR-SAVR group (17% vs 12% vs 9%, respectively; 
P < 0.001). Compared with SAVR-SAVR, risk-adjusted operative mortality was 
significantly higher for TAVR-SAVR (OR: 1.53; P = 0.004), but not SAVR-TAVR-SAVR 
(OR: 1.02; P = 0.927). After propensity score matching, operative mortality of 
isolated SAVR was 1.74 times higher for TAVR-SAVR than SAVR-SAVR patients 
(P = 0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of post-TAVR reoperations is increasing and represent a 
high-risk population. Yet even in isolated SAVR cases, SAVR after TAVR is 
independently associated with increased risk of mortality. Patients with life 
expectancy beyond a TAVR valve and unsuitable anatomy for redo-TAVR should 
consider a SAVR-first approach.

BACKGROUND: Screening for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is recommended for people 
aged above 65 years. Screening for AF in asymptomatic individuals can be 
beneficial by enabling earlier diagnosis and the commencement of interventions 
to reduce the risk of early events, thus improving patient outcomes. This study 
systematically reviews the literature about the cost-effectiveness of various 
screening methods for previously undiagnosed AF.
METHODS: Four databases were searched to identify articles that are 
cost-effectiveness studies conducted on screening for AF published from January 
2000 to August 2022. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting 
Standards 2022 checklist was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. 
A previously published approach was used to assess the usefulness of each study 
for health policy makers.
RESULTS: The database search yielded 799 results, with 26 articles meeting the 
inclusion criteria. Articles were categorised into four subgroups: (i) 
population screening, (ii) opportunistic screening, (iii) targeted, and (iv) 
mixed methods of screening. Most of the studies screened adults ≥65 years of 
age. Most studies were performed from a 'health care payer perspective' and 
almost all studies used 'not screening' as a comparator. Almost all screening 
methods assessed were found to be cost-effective in comparison to 'not 
screening'. The reporting quality varied between 58% to 89%. The majority of the 
studies were found to be of limited usefulness for health policy makers, as none 
of the studies made any clear statements about policy change or implementation 
direction.
CONCLUSION: All approaches of AF screening were found to be cost-effective 
compared with no screening, while opportunistic screening was found to be the 
optimal approach in some studies. However, screening for AF in asymptomatic 
individuals is context specific and likely to be cost-effective depending on the 
population screened, screening approach, frequency, and the duration of 
screening.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the risk factors for synchronous lung metastases (LM) in 
patients with major salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MaSG-MEC).
METHODS: MaSG-MEC patients were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology 
and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2014. Descriptive statistics 
were used to examine the baseline characteristics of the patients. We examined 
the association between risk factors and synchronous LM using Chi-squared tests. 
The primary study outcomes were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific 
survival (CSS). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank 
test. Hazard analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: A total of 701 patients were analyzed, which including 8 patients 
(1.1%) with synchronous LM, and 693 patients without synchronous LM (98.9%). 
Lower T or N classification, and highly differentiated disease were associated 
with a significantly lower risk of LM and multivariate logistic regression 
analysis showed that lower T classification were associated with a significantly 
lower risk of LM (P < 0.05, respectively). Elderly Caucasian male patients with 
poorly differentiated disease, multiple sites of metastases and no surgical 
therapy to primary tumor were more likely to reduce life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: By analyzing data from a large cohort, lower T or N classification 
and highly differentiated disease were associated with a significantly lower 
risk of LM. Elderly Caucasian male patients with poorly differentiated disease, 
multiple sites of metastases and no surgical therapy to primary tumor were more 
likely to reduce life expectancy. More accurate assessments of LM will be 
imperative for early diagnosis and treatment in patients who harbored with 
higher T or N classification and poorly differentiated disease.

Cancer and cardiac diseases are the most prevalent causes of death in most 
developed countries. Due to the earlier detection and higher effectiveness of 
treatment, more patients survive the disease and have a long life expectancy. As 
the post-cancer population is growing, an increasing number of patients will be 
diagnosed with sequelae of those therapies, most often affecting the 
cardiovascular system. Although the risk of cancer recurrence decreases within 
years, the risk of cardiac complications-for example left ventricle (LV) 
systolic and diastolic dysfunction, arterial hypertension, arrhythmias, 
pericardial effusion and premature coronary artery disease remains elevated for
