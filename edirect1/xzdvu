measure different aspects of functional outcome. In addition, objective 
evaluation and perceptual analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included in this study. The median time between 
the start of radiotherapy and assessment was 42 months (range, 26-143 months). 
Patients reported high-level functioning, with low symptom scores and good 
swallowing function, and showed a median dysphonia grade of 1.5. The median 
Voice Handicap Index-30 score was 17.5.
CONCLUSION: Patients with T2N0 glottic carcinoma treated with radiotherapy had 
good long-term quality of life, with low symptom scores, good swallowing 
functioning and slightly elevated voice outcome parameters.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is considered a significant public health issue 
with a substantial and growing epidemiologic and economic burden in relation to 
longer life expectancy and aging global population.
AIMS: To determine cost-of-disease of heart failure (HF) in Turkey from the 
payer perspective.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cost of disease study.
METHODS: In this cost-of-disease study, annual direct and indirect costs of 
management of HF were determined based on epidemiological, clinical and lost 
productivity inputs provided by a Delphi panel consisted of 11 experts in HF 
with respect to ejection fraction (EF) status (HF patients with reduced EF 
(HFrEF), mid-range EF (HFmrEF) and preserved EF (HFpEF)) and New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) classification. Direct medical costs included cost items on 
outpatient management, inpatient management, medications, and non-pharmaceutical 
treatments. Indirect cost was calculated based on the lost productivity due to 
absenteeism and presenteeism.
RESULTS: 51.4%, 19.5%, and 29.1% of the patients were estimated to be HFrEF, 
HFmrEF, and HFpEF patients, respectively. The total annual direct medical cost 
per patient was $887 and non-pharmaceutical treatments ($373, 42.1%) were the 
major direct cost driver. Since an estimated nationwide number of HF patients is 
1,128,000 in 2021, the total annual national economic burden of HF is estimated 
to be $1 billion in 2021. The direct medical cost was higher in patients with 
HFrEF than in those with HFmrEF or HFpEF ($1,147 vs. $555 and $649, 
respectively). Average indirect cost per patient was calculated to be $3,386 and 
was similar across HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF groups, but increased with advanced 
NYHA stage.
CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the substantial economic burden of HF in terms 
of both direct and indirect costs and indicate that the non-pharmaceutical cost 
is the major direct medical cost driver in HF management, regardless of the EF 
status of HF patients.

Objectives: We examined the magnitude and determinants of socioeconomic 
disparities in disability-free life expectancy and life expectancy at age 65 
(DFLE65 and LE65) in China. Methods: Data from Chinese Longitudinal Healthy 
Longevity Survey collected during 2011-2018 (8,184 participants aged ≥65) were 
used. Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by economic status (ES), and 
education, respectively. Multistate Markov models and microsimulations were 
fitted to estimate DFLE65 and LE65. Results: LE65 between high- and low-ES 
groups differed by 2.20 years for males and 2.04 years for females. The DFLE65 
disparity in ES was 1.51 and 1.29 years for males and females, respectively. Not 
undergoing physical examinations, inadequate fruit/vegetable intake, and stress 
contributed to 35.10% and 57.36% of DFLE65 disparity in ES, as well as 26.36% 
and 42.65% of LE65 disparity for males and females, respectively. These 
disparities in education and ES were of a similar magnitude, while the above 
factors contributed little to education disparity. Conclusion: Socioeconomic 
disparities in DFLE65 and LE65 existed in China. Physical examination, 
fruit/vegetable intake and stress partly explained these disparities.

Bisected N-glycans represent a unique class of protein N-glycans that play 
critical roles in many biological processes. Herein, we describe the systematic 
synthesis of these structures. A bisected N-glycan hexasaccharide was chemically 
assembled with two orthogonal protecting groups attached at the C2 of the 
branching mannose residues, followed by sequential installation of GlcNAc and 
LacNAc building blocks to afford two asymmetric bisecting "cores". Subsequent 
enzymatic modular extension of the "cores" yielded a comprehensive library of 
biantennary N-glycans containing the bisecting GlcNAc and presenting 6 common 
glycan determinants in a combinatorial fashion. These bisected N-glycans and 
their non-bisected counterparts were used to construct a distinctive glycan 
microarray to study their recognition by a wide variety of glycan-binding 
proteins (GBPs), including plant lectins, animal lectins, and influenza A virus 
hemagglutinins. Significantly, the bisecting GlcNAc could bestow (PHA-L, 
rDCIR2), enhance (PHA-E), or abolish (ConA, GNL, anti-CD15s antibody, etc.) 
N-glycan recognition of specific GBPs, and is tolerated by many others. In 
summary, synthesized compounds and the unique glycan microarray provide ideal 
standards and tools for glycoanalysis and functional glycomic studies. The 
microarray data provide new information regarding the fine details of N-glycan 
recognition by GBPs, and in turn improve their applications.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting 0.6-0.75% of dogs in 
veterinary practice. Treatment is frequently complicated by the occurrence of 
drug-resistant epilepsy and cluster seizures in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. 
Only few studies are available to guide treatment choices beyond licensed 
veterinary drugs. The aim of the study was to compare antiseizure efficacy and 
tolerability of two add-on treatment strategies in dogs with drug-resistant 
idiopathic epilepsy. The study design was a prospective, open-label, 
non-blinded, comparative treatment trial. Treatment success was defined as a 
3-fold extension of the longest baseline interseizure interval and to a minimum 
of 3 months. To avoid prolonged adherence to a presumably ineffective treatment 
strategy, dog owners could leave the study after the third day with generalized 
seizures if the interseizure interval failed to show a relevant increase. 
Twenty-six dogs (mean age 5.5 years, mean seizure frequency 4/month) with 
drug-resistant idiopathic epilepsy and a history of cluster seizures were 
included. Dogs received either add-on treatment with pregabalin (PGB) 4 mg/kg 
twice daily (14 dogs) or a dose increase in levetiracetam (LEV) add-on treatment 
(12 dogs). Thirteen dogs in the PGB group had drug levels within the therapeutic 
range for humans. Two dogs in the PGB group (14.3%; 2/14) and one dog in the LEV 
group (8.3%; 1/12) achieved treatment success with long seizure-free intervals 
from 122 to 219 days but then relapsed to their early seizure frequency 10 
months after the study inclusion. The overall low success rates with both 
treatment strategies likely reflect a real-life situation in canine 
drug-resistant idiopathic epilepsy in everyday veterinary practice. These 
results delineate the need for research on better pharmacologic and 
non-pharmacologic treatment strategies in dogs with drug-resistant epilepsy.

The life expectancy of the world's elderly population (65 and older) continues 
to reach new milestones with older individuals currently comprising greater than 
8.5% (617 million) of the world's population. This percentage is predicted to 
approach 20% of the world's population by 2050 (representing 1.6 billion 
people). Despite this amazing feat, many healthcare systems are not equipped to 
handle the multitude of diseases that commonly manifest with age, including most 
types of cancers. As the world's aging population grows, cancer treatments 
continue to evolve. Immunotherapies are a new drug class that has revolutionized 
our ability to treat previously intractable cancers; however, their efficacy in 
patients with compromised immune systems remains unclear. In this review, we 
will discuss how aging-associated losses in immune homeostasis impact the 
efficacy and safety of immunotherapy treatment in preclinical models of aging. 
We will also discuss how these findings translate to elderly patients receiving 
immunotherapy treatment for refractory and relapsed cancers, as well as, 
strategies that could be explored to improve the efficacy of immunotherapies in 
aged patients.

After the COVID-19 pandemic reached Missouri, the Show-Me ECHO (Extension for 
Community Healthcare Outcomes) project initiated COVID-19 ECHO virtual 
knowledge-sharing networking sessions. These live-interactive weekly sessions 
inform participants about up-to-date evidence-based recommendations and 
guidelines through expert didactic lectures followed by real-life case 
discussions. We conducted a qualitative analysis of pre-session surveys and 
questions asked during sessions to learn about information needs of community 
members during first months of public health emergency. This was a pilot project 
using qualitative analysis of registration questions regarding anticipated 
COVID-19 community information needs, and participants' questions asked during 
sessions collected from March 23 until May 4, 2020. We also analyzed 
participants' satisfaction surveys collected in December 2020. A total of 761 
unique participants attended COVID-19 ECHO during the study period. Survey was 
completed by 692 respondents. Participants asked 315 questions resulting in 797 
identified community information needs. Five thematic categories were 
recognized: patient care, information seeking, minimizing exposure, financial 
themes, and general comments. Most attendees rated content quality, logistics, 
and technical operations as good or excellent on a five-point Likert scale. The 
COVID-19 ECHO model was responsive to the needs of participants by sharing and 
discussing up-to-date recommendations and guidelines regarding COVID-19. 
Sessions were well-attended, and the didactic presenters were invited to deliver 
same or similar presentations at Boone County Medical Society (BCMS) weekly 
seminars, suggesting the value of the project to healthcare providers and other 
community members caring for or working with the most vulnerable populations.

The rice production system is one of the most climate change sensitive 
agro-ecosystems. This paper reviews the effects of current and future climate 
change on rice production in China. In recent decades, thermal resources have 
increased during the rice growing season, while solar radiation resources have 
decreased, and precipitation heterogeneity has increased. The increasing 
frequency of high-temperature stress, heavy rainfall, drought, and flood 
disasters may reduce the utilization efficiency of hydrothermal resources. 
Climate change, thus far, has resulted in a significant northward shift in the 
potential planting boundaries of single- and double-cropping rice production 
systems, which negatively affects the growth duration of single-, early-, and 
late-cropping rice. Studies based on statistical and process-based crop models 
show that climate change has affected rice production in China. The effects of 
climate change on the yield of single rice (SR), early rice (ER), and late rice 
(LR) were significant; however, the results of different methods and different 
rice growing areas were different to some extent. The trend of a longer growth 
period and higher yield of rice reflects the ability of China's rice production 
system to adapt to climate change by adjusting planting regionalization and 
improving varieties and cultivation techniques. The results of the impact 
assessment under different climate scenarios indicated that the rice growth 
period would shorten and yield would decrease in the future. This means that 
climate change will seriously affect China's rice production and food security. 
Further research requires a deeper understanding of abiotic stress physiology 
and its integration into ecophysiological models to reduce the uncertainty of 
impact assessment and expand the systematicness of impact assessment.

Objective.This study aims at quantifying the lifetime attributable risk of 
secondary fatal cancer (LARFAC) to patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy 
treatment for thymoma, a neoplasm where cure rates and life expectancy are 
relatively high, patient age at presentation relatively low and indications for 
radiotherapy controversial depending on the disease stage.Approach.An 
anthropomorphic phantom was scanned, organs were contoured and a standard 6 MV 
3DCRT treatment plan was produced for thymoma treatment. The phantom was loaded 
with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and treated by linear accelerator per 
plan. The TLDs were subsequently read for out-of-field dose distribution while 
in-field dose distribution was obtained from the planning system. Sex and 
age-specific lifetime radiogenic cancer risk was calculated as the sum of 
in-field risk and out-of-field risk. The latter risk was estimated using hybrid 
ICRP 2007 103-BEIR VII tables of organ-specific risks based on the linear-no 
threshold (LNT) model and applicable at low doses, while the former using 
mathematical risk models applicable at high doses.Main results.The LARFAC 
associated with a prescribed dose of 50 Gy to target volume in 25 fractions was 
in the approximate range of 1%-3%. The risk was higher for young and female 
patients. The largest contributing organ to this risk were the lungs by far. 
Using the LNT model inappropriately to calculate risk at therapeutic doses 
(in-field) would overestimate the risk up to tenfold.Significance.The LARFAC to 
patient from thymoma radiotherapy was quantified taking into consideration the 
inapplicability of the LNT model at therapeutic doses. The risk is not 
negligible; the information may be relevant to patients and clinicians.

Introduction: The evidence for prostatic urethral lift (PUL), in treating lower 
urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with 
obstructive median lobes (OMLs), has grown. In this study, we present the first 
detailed comparison of outcomes between OML patients treated with PUL in 
controlled and real-world settings to relevant comparators (subjects treated 
with transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] and sham in randomized 
controlled trials [RCTs]) to demonstrate similar symptom, safety, and patient 
experience outcomes. Materials and Methods: Symptom and safety outcomes and 
patient satisfaction were compared through 12 months among controlled PUL 
studies: BPH6 RCT (35 men randomized to TURP); L.I.F.T. pivotal RCT in subjects 
with lateral lobe obstruction (66 subjects randomized to sham) and MedLift, an 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved Investigational Device Exemption 
(IDE) extension of the L.I.F.T. trial (45 men with OML). Symptom improvement, 
catheterization, and adverse event rates were compared between MedLift subjects 
and OML patients (n = 187) from the large real-world retrospective (RWR) study 
of PUL filtered on baseline characteristics to approximate the MedLift 
population. Results: Posttreatment, International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) 
improvement for MedLift subjects was 170% greater compared with sham at 3 months 
with significantly better quality of life (QoL), Qmax, and benign prostatic 
hyperplasia impact index (BPHII). Compared with TURP, MedLift IPSS and QoL 
improved significantly better at 1 and 3 months and with superior ejaculatory 
function scores at all time points after PUL. IPSS, QoL, postvoid residual 
(PVR), and Qmax outcomes were equivalent between MedLift and RWR OML groups at 
3, 6, and 12 months. RWR OML patients did not experience higher rates of overall 
adverse events compared with MedLift. Conclusion: Controlled and real-world 
outcomes confirm PUL is a safe and effective treatment for BPH patients with and 
without OML.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 75% of breast cancer (BC) is associated with luminal 
differentiation expressing endocrine receptors (ER). For ER+ HER2- tumors, 
adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) is the cornerstone treatment. Although relapse 
events steadily continue, the ET benefits translate to dramatically lengthen 
life expectancy with bearable side-effects. This review of ER+ HER2- female BC 
outlines suitable adjuvant treatment strategies to help guide clinical decision 
making around appropriate therapy.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane 
Libraries, using ER+ HER-, ET BC keywords.
RESULTS: In low-risk patients: five years of ET is the standard option. While 
Tamoxifen remains the preferred selection for premenopausal women, AI is the 
choice for postmenopausal patients. In the high-risk category: ET plus/minus OFS 
with two years of Abemaciclib is recommended. Although extended ET for a total 
of ten years is an alternative, the optimal AI duration is undetermined; 
nevertheless an additional two to three years beyond the initial five years may 
be sufficient. In this postmenopausal group, bisphosphonate is endorsed.
CONCLUSIONS: Classifying the risk category assists in deciding the treatment 
route and its optimal duration. Tailoring the breadth of ET hinges on a wide 
array of factors to be appraised for each individualized case, including 
weighing its benefits and harms.

In the present day, the increment in life expectancy has led to the necessity of 
developing new biomaterials for the restoration or substitution of damaged 
organs that have lost their functionalities. Among all the research about 
biomaterials, this review paper aimed to expose the main possibilities that the 
sol-gel synthesis method can provide for the fabrication of materials with 
interest in the biomedical field, more specifically, when this synthesis method 
is used to improve the biological properties of different magnesium alloys used 
as biomaterials. The sol-gel method has been widely studied and used to generate 
ceramic materials for a wide range of purposes during the last fifty years. 
Focused on biomedical research, the sol-gel synthesis method allows the 
generation of different kinds of biomaterials with diverse morphologies and a 
high potential for the biocompatibility improvement of a wide range of materials 
commonly used in the biomedical field such as metallic implants, as well as for 
the generation of drug delivery systems or interesting biomaterials for new 
tissue engineering therapies.

Meat is a food of animal origin, which can be contaminated by infectious, 
parasitic and other non-infectious agents responsible for diseases, which 
threaten the health of consumers. This still poses a public health problem in 
Algeria and in many countries. In order to assess the epidemiological situation 
of certain diseases in the Taher region in Jijel and to determine the influence 
of certain variation factors and to estimate the risk on public health, a study 
was extended over a period of 14 months on a total of 1756 cattle slaughtered at 
the Taher slaughterhouse. The results showed that 609 cattle (34.68%) showed 
lesions. The highest rate of pathological findings was observed on the liver 
(37.27%) followed by the lungs (30.21%). The lowest rate was recorded on the 
digestive system (0.33%) followed by the kidneys (1.14%). In addition, the liver 
and lungs were more contaminated with hydatid cyst compared to other organs 
(20.69%, 19.05%, respectively). Our data showed that the diseases affected more 
females (55.82%) than males (44.17%) (p < 0.001). Furthermore, cattle aged 
between 3 and 5 years were the most affected (43.51%) and local breed cattle 
showed more lesions (71.59%). These results testify to the real risk represented 
by the consumption of organs affected by diseases, and the need to recognize the 
agents of contamination and the mode of transmission and to implement an 
extension and control program in this region depending on the epidemiological 
aspect of the lesions.

After the copulation process, some sperm start the long journey with an ultimate 
goal of fertilizing the oocyte. Inside the oviduct, sperm are stored, waiting 
for the ovulated oocyte where they bind to the apical surface of the oviduct 
cells, which in turn hold sperm to form a sperm nest. The essential functions of 
the sperm reservoir include attaching spermatozoa to oviduct epithelial cells, 
selecting intact, good-quality sperm with an end result of extending sperm life 
expectancy. The current study aimed to evaluate the fertilization ability of 
sperm that bind to cell aggregates from different parts of the oviduct 
(infundibulum-ampulla-isthmus), and to assess the effect of heparin and or 
progesterone (P4) on the in-vitro fertilization ability of sperm co-incubated 
with cell aggregates from the isthmus. In-vitro fertilization was identified as 
a cleaved oocyte to two cells or more. The sperm bound to cell aggregates from 
the isthmus improved the rate of in-vitro fertilization (48.09%) compared to 
aggregates from the infundibulum (36.90%) and ampulla (37.61%). Moreover, 
pre-treatment of mature COCs with heparin (40 μg/mL) and P4 (80 nanomolar) play 
a coactive role that improves the in-vitro fertilization ability of sperm bound 
to cell aggregates from isthmus (63.33%), compared to 42.61% in the absence of 
cells aggregates. In conclusion, binding to cell aggregates from isthmus 
improves the in-vitro fertilization ability of Bovine sperm. Additionally, 
heparin, together with P4, exerts a synergistic action that improves the 
in-vitro fertilizing potential of sperm attached to cell aggregates from the 
isthmus of the bovine oviduct.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A previous study found that the cross-sectional area (CSA) 
of the preoperative cervical paraspinal extensors (CPEs) was associated with 
loss of cervical lordosis after laminoplasty, while a recent study found that 
CPE asymmetry was associated with symptoms of degenerative cervical myelopathy. 
Whether preoperative CPE asymmetry can predict cervical sagittal deformity (CSD) 
after laminoplasty is unknown.
PURPOSE: To assess whether asymmetry, degree of degeneration, and extension 
function of the CPE can be used as predictors of postoperative CSD in patients 
who undergo laminoplasty.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: From January 2017 to December 2019, 55 patients with multilevel 
cord compression and myelopathic symptoms were enrolled.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The visual analog scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), 
and modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) were used to assess cervical 
spinal function and quality of life.
METHODS: From January 2017 to December 2019, 55 patients undergoing modified 
laminoplasty were included. The following parameters were measured 
preoperatively and 24 months postoperatively on X-ray: (1) C0-C2 Cobb angle; (2) 
C2-C7 Cobb angle (CL); (3) T1 slope (T1S); (5) C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis 
(SVA); (6) T1S minus CL; (7) Preoperative extension function: Extension CL minus 
Neutral CL (EF). Preoperative global alignment parameters: (8) spino cranial 
angle, (9) C7-S1 sagittal vertical axis (C7 SVA), (10) pelvic incidence, (11) 
lumbar lordosis, (12) thoracic kyphosis. (13) Preoperative CPE parameters: 
Summation of bilateral total cross-sectional area (STCSA), summation of 
bilateral total cross-sectional area ratio (STCSAR), total cross-sectional area 
asymmetry, summation of bilateral functional cross-sectional area of muscle 
(SFCSA), summation of bilateral functional cross-sectional area of muscle ratio 
(FCSAR), and functional cross-sectional area of muscle asymmetry (FCSAA). The 
VAS, mJOA, and NDI were used to evaluate cervical spine function and quality of 
life. Patients were divided into the CSD group and the non-deformed group 
(N-CSD) group postoperatively, and the parameters between the two groups were 
compared. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the 
relationship between the parameters, and multiple regression analysis and ROC 
curve analysis were used to determine the predictors and key values.
RESULTS: Compared with functional scores, mJOA in the CSD group was 
significantly lower than that in the N-CSD group, while NDI and VAS were 
significantly higher. Postoperative CL was significantly correlated with EF, 
SFCSA/STCSA (C3-C6), SFCSAR (C4 and C6), STCSAR (C6), and FSCAA (C6). T1S minus 
CL was significantly correlated with EF, SFCSA/STCSA (C3-4 and C6), SFCSAR (C4 
and C6), STCSAR (C6) and FSCAA (C6). C2-7 SVA was significantly correlated with 
EF, SFCSAR (C4 and C6), STCSAR (C6), and FSCAA (C6). Multiple regression 
analysis showed that FCSAA (C6), SFCSAR (C6), SFCSAR (C4), and EF were 
significant predictors of postoperative CSD. ROC curve analysis showed that the 
optimal cutoff points were 18.405, 2.95, 4.47, and 11.96.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that preoperative extension dysfunction of 
CPEs, asymmetry at the C6 level cervical extensors, and cervical extensor CSAs 
without fatty infiltration at the C4 and C6 levels were associated with cervical 
sagittal imbalance after modified laminoplasty. These factors can be considered 
when future spine surgeons formulate surgical plans.

BACKGROUND: Pregnant individuals are vulnerable to COVID-19-related acute 
respiratory distress syndrome. There is a lack of high-quality evidence on 
whether elective delivery or expectant management leads to better maternal and 
neonatal outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether elective delivery or expectant 
management are associated with higher quality-adjusted life expectancy for 
pregnant individuals with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome 
and their neonates.
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a clinical decision analysis using a patient-level 
model in which we simulatedpregnant individuals and their unborn children. We 
used a patient-level model with parallel open-cohort structure, daily cycle 
length, continuous discounting, lifetime horizon, sensitivity analyses for key 
parameter values, and 1000 iterations for quantification of uncertainty. We 
simulated pregnant individuals at 32 weeks of gestation, invasively ventilated 
because of COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the elective 
delivery strategy, pregnant individuals received immediate cesarean delivery. In 
the expectant management strategy, pregnancies continued until spontaneous labor 
or obstetrical decision to deliver. For both pregnant individuals and neonates, 
model outputs were hospital or perinatal survival, life expectancy, and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy denominated in years, summarized by the mean 
and 95% credible interval. Maternal utilities incorporated neonatal outcomes in 
accordance with best practices in perinatal decision analysis.
RESULTS: Model outputs for pregnant individuals were similar when comparing 
elective delivery at 32 weeks' gestation with expectant management, including 
hospital survival (87.1% vs 87.4%), life-years (difference, -0.1; 95% credible 
interval, -1.4 to 1.1), and quality-adjusted life expectancy denominated in 
years (difference, -0.1; 95% credible interval, -1.3 to 1.1). For neonates, 
elective delivery at 32 weeks' gestation was estimated to lead to a higher 
perinatal survival (98.4% vs 93.2%; difference, 5.2%; 95% credible interval, 
3.5-7), similar life-years (difference, 0.9; 95% credible interval, -0.9 to 
2.8), and higher quality-adjusted life expectancy denominated in years 
(difference, 1.3; 95% credible interval, 0.4-2.2). For pregnant individuals, 
elective delivery was not superior to expectant management across a range of 
scenarios between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. Elective delivery in cases where 
intrauterine death or maternal mortality were more likely resulted in higher 
neonatal quality-adjusted life expectancy, as did elective delivery at 30 weeks' 
gestation (difference, 1.1 years; 95% credible interval, 0.1 - 2.1) despite 
higher long-term complications (4.3% vs 0.5%; difference, 3.7%; 95% credible 
interval, 2.4-5.1), and in cases where intrauterine death or maternal acute 
respiratory distress syndrome mortality were more likely.
CONCLUSION: The decision to pursue elective delivery vs expectant management in 
pregnant individuals with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome 
should be guided by gestational age, risk of intrauterine death, and maternal 
acute respiratory distress syndrome severity. For the pregnant individual, 
elective delivery is comparable but not superior to expectant management for 
gestational ages from 28 to 34 weeks. For neonates, elective delivery was 
superior if gestational age was ≥30 weeks and if the rate of intrauterine death 
or maternal mortality risk were high. We recommend basing the decision for 
elective delivery vs expectant management in a pregnant individual with 
COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome on gestational age and 
likelihood of intrauterine or maternal death.

Thrombotic complications during COVID-19 infections occur frequently, and 
anticoagulants to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis appear to have a good 
safety profile in these patients. In addition, haemorrhagic complications during 
COVID-19 infections have also been reported. Hepatic inflammation can occur in 
COVID-19 infections as a direct consequence of cellular infection and cytopathy. 
Spontaneous subcapsular hepatic haematoma is extremely rare and can be 
life-threatening.A woman in her 40s presented to the hospital with fever and 
shortness of breath and was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection with respiratory 
failure requiring intubation. On day 49 of hospitalisation, she developed melena 
and acute anaemia; her haemoglobin dropped from 97g/L (9.7g/dL) to 56g/L 
(5.6g/dL). Abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed a large subcapsular liver 
haematoma with retroperitoneal extension. The patient received blood 
transfusions and remained haemodynamically stable. She was eventually extubated 
and discharged home.

With the aging of the society, the proportion of elderly patients with gastric 
cancer is increasing and the chances of encountering elderly patients with early 
gastric cancer (EGC) are increasing. Because elderly patients have more 
comorbidities, and lower life expectancy than younger patients, the treatment 
strategy for elderly patients with EGC is not standardized. Therefore, it is 
necessary to identify risk factors related to survival of elderly patients with 
EGC and to establish treatment strategies according to prognosis in elderly 
patients with EGC.

The presence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in our daily life is increasing 
every day and, by extension, human exposure and the consequences thereof. Among 
these substances are bisphenols and parabens. Urine is used to analyze the 
exposure. The determination of 12 bisphenol homologues and 6 parabens is 
proposed. A procedure based on a method previously developed by our research 
group in 2014 is improved. The extraction yield is higher, because the new 
protocol is 5 times more efficient. Also, a comparison between calibration with 
pure standards and matrix calibration, to calculate the matrix effect, was also 
made. A high grade of matrix effect for all analytes was observed. In terms of 
validation, the limits of detection (LOD) were between 0.03 and 0.3 ng mL-1 and 
limits of quantification (LOQ) 0.1 to 1.0 ng mL-1, respectively, and the 
recovery is higher than 86.4% and lower than 113.6%, with a RSD lower than 13.5% 
in all cases. A methodology for accurate and sensitive quantification of 
bisphenol homologues together with parabens in human urine using UHPLC-MS/MS was 
developed. The method was successfully applied to 30 urine samples from 
children.
