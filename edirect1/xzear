BACKGROUND: The phase 3 TERIKIDS study demonstrated efficacy and manageable 
safety for teriflunomide versus placebo in children with relapsing multiple 
sclerosis (RMS).
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) concentrations in 
TERIKIDS.
METHODS: Patients received placebo or teriflunomide (14 mg adult equivalent) for 
up to 96 weeks in the double-blind (DB) period. In the open-label extension 
(OLE), all patients received teriflunomide until up to 192 weeks after 
randomization. pNfL was measured using single-molecule array assay (Simoa® 
NF-light™).
RESULTS: Baseline mean age was 14.5 years; 69.4% were female. Baseline geometric 
least square mean pNfL levels were similar for teriflunomide (n = 78) and 
placebo (n = 33) patients (19.83 vs 18.30 pg/mL). Over the combined DB and OLE 
periods, pNfL values were lower for teriflunomide versus placebo (analysis of 
variance p < 0.01; Week 192: 10.61 vs 17.32 pg/mL). Observed between-group pNfL 
differences were attenuated upon adjustment for gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing or 
new/enlarged T2 lesion counts at DB Week 24. Higher baseline pNfL levels were 
associated with shorter time since first MS symptom onset, higher baseline 
Gd-enhancing lesion counts and T2 lesion volume, and increased hazard of high 
magnetic resonance imaging activity or clinical relapse during the DB period.
CONCLUSION: Teriflunomide treatment was associated with significantly reduced 
pNfL levels in children with RMS.

PURPOSE: In 2019, in Australia, there were 500,000 people aged 85 and over. 
Traditionally, clinicians have adopted the view that surgery is not desirable in 
this cohort due to increasing perioperative risk, perceived minimal clinical 
benefit, and shortened life expectancy. This cohort study is aimed at 
investigating postoperative outcomes from elective and non-elective colorectal 
cancer surgery in patients aged 80 and over.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients from 2010 to 2020 on 
a prospectively maintained colorectal database. Patients aged over 80 who 
underwent surgical resection for colorectal cancer were reviewed. Oncological 
characteristics, short-term outcomes, overall survival, and relapse-free 
survival rates were analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 832 patients were identified from the database. Females 
comprised 55% of patients aged 80 and above. The median age was 84 for 
octogenarians and 92 for nonagenarians. Most patients were ASA 2 (212) or ASA 3 
(501). ASA 3 and 4 and stage III pathology were associated with higher 
postoperative complications. Fifty percent of over 80 s and 37% of over 90 s 
were surgically discharged to their own home. Overall survival at 30, 180, and 
360 days and 5 years was 98.1%, 93.1%, 87.2%, and 57.2% for the over 80 s and 
98.1%, 88.9%, 74.9%, and 24.4% for the over 90 s.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that surgical treatment of older patients is 
safe with acceptable short-, medium-, and long-term survival. Nonetheless, 
efforts are needed to reduce the rates of complications in older patients, 
including utilisation of multi-disciplinary teams to assess the optimal 
treatment strategy and postoperative care.

AIM: To assess the effects of the nursing workforce and advanced nursing 
practice on the outcomes of patients and life expectancy, including mortality 
rates of under-five children in Cambodia, and to develop policy recommendations 
to increase the influence of the nursing workforce.
BACKGROUND: In low-middle-income nations, life expectancy and under-five 
mortality are important measures of public health. However, there is still a 
dearth of literature related to the nursing workforce in Southeast Asia.
METHOD: The authors retrieved the data from the World Nursing Report produced by 
the World Health Organization 2020 for 10 member states. The transparent 
reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or 
diagnosis checklist has guided this study. The univariate linear regression 
model was applied to categorize the potential predictors for each outcome 
assessment. In addition, the Spearman rank correlation test was selected to 
assess the potential predictors, and a multivariate statistical analysis was 
carried out for each of the five outcomes.
RESULTS: According to the study's findings, nurse density and advanced practice 
nursing improve both female and male life expectancy. The existence of advanced 
nursing roles is associated with decreased under-five mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: There are great opportunities to improve the nursing workforce 
within Cambodia and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations member states 
to increase patient outcomes. Investment in nursing is essential for improved 
patient outcomes.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Health policy investments in these 
projects and future initiatives intended to advance nurse density, education, 
and practice are based on this study's results. Policy initiatives should focus 
on increasing density because nursing appears to impact life expectancy and 
other outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic factors for survival and toxicities in 
elderly (≥65 years) patients with endometrial cancer who underwent 
post-operative radiotherapy. Additionally, to compare the treatment outcomes 
between the older elderly (≥75 years) and younger elderly (65-74 years) 
patients.
METHODS: Medical records of patients with enometrial cancer treated between 
January 1998 and July 2019 were reviewed. Patients with stage IA to IIIC2, all 
histology subtypes, and any grade were included. All patients underwent total 
abdominal hysterectomy and received adjuvant radiotherapy with or without 
chemotherapy. All but 67 (8.4%) of 801 patients had lymph node dissection. 
Clinicopathological factors and treatment strategies were compared between the 
two age groups. The prognostic factors for overall survival and progression-free 
survival were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 801 patients with enometrial cancer, 627 patients (78.3%) 
younger elderly and 174 patients (21.7%) in the older elderly group were 
included. Median follow-up was 74.3 months (range 0.4-224.6). The older elderly 
patients had significantly higher rates of grade 3 tumors (51.7% vs 40.8%; 
p=0.04), cervical glandular involvement (21.8% vs 14.0%; p=0.03), and cervical 
stromal invasion (34.5% vs 27.9%; p=0.04) than the younger elderly patients. The 
rates of lymph node dissection (p=0.2), radiotherapy modalities (p=0.92), and 
systemic chemotherapy (p=0.2) did not differ between the two groups. The 5-year 
locoregional control and distant metastasis rates were 88.3% and 23.8%, 
respectively. The 5-year cause-specific survival and progression-free survival 
rates for younger and older elderly patients, were 79.8% vs 74.3% (p=0.04) and 
67.5% vs 57.8% (p<0.001), respectively. In multivariate analysis, larger tumor 
size, non-endometrioid histology, cervical stromal involvement, and stage III 
disease were associated with poor cause-specific survival and progression-free 
survival. Age was an independent predictor of worse progression-free survival, 
but not of cause-specific survival. There was no significant difference in acute 
and late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities between age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative radiotherapy for elderly patients with endometrial 
cancer is effective and well tolerated. Advanced age should not preclude 
appropriate treatment, especially in those with adequate quality of life, life 
expectancy, and functional status.

In the iron- and sulfur-oxidizing acidophilic chemolithoautotrophic bacterium, 
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, tetrathionate hydrolase gene (Af-tth) is highly 
expressed during tetrathionate growth. The expression levels of Af-tth were 
specifically determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction and the expression ratios of S0/Fe2+ and S4O62-/Fe2+ were found to be 
68 ± 21 and 181 ± 5, respectively. The transcriptional start site was identified 
by primer extension. Promoter regions of Af-tth were cloned into the expression 
shuttle vector pMPJC and GFP gene was under the direction of the regions. Green 
fluorescence was observed by UV irradiation in recombinant A. ferrooxidans 
harboring the plasmid colonies grown on tetrathionate. Furthermore, His-tagged 
Af-Tth was synthesized in the recombinant cells grown on tetrathionate. 
Recombinant, His-tagged Af-Tth in an active form, was rapidly purified through 
metal-affinity column chromatography, although recombinant Af-Tth was 
synthesized in the inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli and acid-refolding 
treatment was necessary to recover the activity. The specific activity of 
purified Af-Tth from recombinant A. ferrooxidans (2.2 ± 0.37 U mg-1) was similar 
to that of acid-refolded Af-Tth from recombinant E. coli (2.5 ± 0.18 U mg-1). 
This method can be applied not only to heterologous expression but also to 
homologous expression of target genes for modification or specific mutation in 
A. ferrooxidans cells.

BACKGROUND: Despite consistently reporting poorer health, women universally 
outlive men. We examine whether gender differences in lived circumstances 
considered, and meaning attributed to SRH by women and men might explain this 
paradox.
METHODS: In an online survey 917 adults rated their health (SRH) and mental 
health (SRMH) and reflected upon what life experiences they considered in making 
their ratings. Descriptive findings were sex-disaggregated. The multiple 
experiences listed were then subject to factor analyses using principal 
components methods and orthogonal rotation.
RESULTS: Women reported poorer SRH and SRMH. They considered a wider range of 
circumstances, weighing all but self-confidence and behaviors as more important 
to SRH than did men. Two underlying components, psychosocial context and 
clinical status were identified overall. Physical health and pain were more 
important elements of men's clinical status and behaviors. Comparisons with 
others of the same age played a larger role in male psycho-social context. Two 
components also underpinned SRMH. These were clinical problems and psycho-social 
circumstances for which self-confidence was only important among men.
CONCLUSIONS: Women's and men's common interpretation of measures like SRH 
suggests that women's health disadvantage is neither artefactual nor determined 
by gendered meanings of measures and does not explain the paradox. SRH and SRMH 
captured social circumstances for all. Convergence of characteristics women and 
men consider as central to health is evidence of the dynamism of gender with 
evolving social norms. The remaining divergence speaks to persisting traditional 
male stereotypes.

BACKGROUND: Obesity in early adulthood is associated with lower breast cancer 
rates in later life. This could be interpreted as a positive reinforcement of 
excess weight amongst younger women however, the wider implications of higher 
weights are less well known. This study examined the association between both 
obesity in early adulthood and body mass index (BMI) change through adulthood, 
and all-cause mortality.
METHODS: The Predicting Risk of Cancer At Screening (PROCAS) study recruited 
57,902 women aged 46-73 years (median age 57.2, IQR 51.8-63.7 years) from the 
Greater Manchester National Health Service breast screening programme in North 
West England between 2009 and 2015. It was used to assess associations between 
BMI at 20 years and cohort entry with all-cause mortality ascertained via deaths 
recorded on the National Breast Screening System to June 2020. Hazard ratios 
were estimated using proportional hazards (Cox) regression adjusted for factors 
at entry to the cohort: age, deprivation, bilateral oophorectomy, 
hormone-replacement therapy, menopausal status, ethnicity, alcohol intake, 
physical activity, and BMI.
RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight (25-30 kg/m2) and obesity (> 30 kg/m2) 
were 10.4% and 2.5% respectively at 20 years, increasing to 35.2% and 25.9% 
respectively at cohort entry. After a mean 8.7 years follow-up we observed that 
overweight (HR = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.10-1.47) and obesity (HR = 2.11, 
95%CI = 1.67-2.66) at 20 years had a higher mortality rate compared with healthy 
weight. Women who were underweight/healthy weight at 20 years and gained weight 
to obesity at entry had a slightly increased mortality rate compared with women 
who were underweight/healthy weight at both time points (HR 1.16, 
95%CI = 1.02-1.32). Women with overweight (HR = 1.36, 95%CI = 1.06-1.75) or 
obesity (HR = 1.90, 95%CI = 1.45-2.48) at both 20 years and entry had a higher 
mortality rate than women who were underweight/healthy weight at both points.
CONCLUSIONS: Women who self-reported overweight and obesity at 20 years had a 
shorter life expectancy in this cohort of women attending breast cancer 
screening. Weight gain from 20 years was common in this group. Girls and women 
should be supported to maintain a healthy weight throughout the lifespan to help 
increase life expectancy. Trial registration number NCT04359420, retrospectively 
registered 24/04/2020.

BACKGROUND: The brain vascular basement membrane (brain-VBM) is an important 
component of the brain extracellular matrix, and the three-dimensional structure 
of the cerebrovascular network nested with many cell-adhesive proteins may 
provide guidance for brain tissue regeneration. However, the potential of 
ability of brain-VBM to promote neural tissue regeneration has not been examined 
due to the technical difficulty of isolating intact brain-VBM.
METHODS: The present study developed a simple, effective method to isolate 
structurally and compositionally intact brain-VBM. Structural and component 
properties of the brain-VBM were characterized to confirm the technique. Seed 
cells were cocultured with brain-VBM in vitro to analyze biocompatibility and 
neurite extension. An experimental rat model of focal traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) induced by controlled cortical impact were conducted to further test the 
tissue regeneration ability of brain-VBM.
RESULTS: Brain-VBM isolated using genipin showed significantly improved 
mechanical properties, was easy to handle, supported high cell viability, 
exhibited strong cell adhesive properties, and promoted neurite extension and 
outgrowth. Further testing of the isolated brain-VBM transplanted at lesion 
sites in an experimental rat model of focal TBI demonstrated considerable 
promise for reconstructing a complete blood vessel network that filled in the 
lesion cavity and promoting repopulation of neural progenitor cells and neurons.
CONCLUSION: The technique allows isolation of intact brain-VBM as a 3D 
microvascular scaffold to support brain tissue regeneration following TBI and 
shows considerable promise for the production of naturally-derived biomaterials 
for neural tissue engineering.

PURPOSE: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin has 
recently been shown to improve the outcomes of heart failure (HF) patients 
regardless of patient's left ventricular ejection fraction by reducing the 
combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF. The 
aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding empagliflozin 
to the standard care (SC) in comparison to SC only in the treatment of HF in 
Finland.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The assessment was performed in the cost-utility framework 
using two Markov cohort state-transition models, one for HF with reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF) and one for HF with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF). The models have been primarily developed based on the EMPEROR-Reduced 
and EMPEROR-Preserved trials which informed the modelled patient 
characteristics, efficacy of treatments in terms of associated risks for heart 
failure hospitalizations, cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV death, treatment 
related adverse events (AE), and state- and event-specific health-related 
quality of life weights (EQ-5D). Direct health care costs were estimated from 
Finnish published references. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from health care 
payer perspective based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost per 
quality adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) and probability of cost-effectiveness 
(at willingness-to-pay [WTP] of 35,000 euros/QALY). The ICER was reported as the 
weighted (HFrEF, 43.5%; HFpEF, 56.5%) average result of the two models.
RESULTS: Empagliflozin + SC treatment increased the average quality-adjusted 
life-expectancy, and treatment costs of HF patients by 0.15 QALYs and 1,594 
euros, respectively, when compared to SC. An additional QALY with empagliflozin 
was thus gained at a cost of 10,621 euros. The probability of empagliflozin + SC 
being cost-effective compared to placebo + SC was 77.6% and 83.5% with WTP of 
35,000 and 100,000 euros/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin is a cost-effective treatment for patients with HF in 
the Finnish health care setting.

BACKGROUND: Holistic multimodal interventions have not been established for 
cancer cachexia. The beliefs and perceptions of health care professionals (HCPs) 
based on their experiences influence the interventions.
OBJECTIVES: HCPs' knowledge, perceptions, and practices in cancer cachexia 
management were evaluated.
DESIGN/SETTING/SUBJECTS/MEASUREMENTS: A nationwide questionnaire survey was 
conducted that focused on the perspectives of HCPs on interventions in 451 
designated cancer hospitals across Japan. Descriptive statistics were applied.
RESULTS: Among 2255 participants, 1320 responded (58.5%), and 1188 in 258 
institutes were included in the analysis. The current international definition 
of cancer cachexia is not commonly known and recent clinical practice guidelines 
have not been widely adopted. More than 50% of participants considered ≥5% 
weight loss in six months and ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status) 2-4 to be cancer cachexia, whereas 50% answered that there 
was no relationship between life expectancy and cancer cachexia. Participants 
tended to consider it important to initiate nutritional and exercise 
interventions before cancer cachexia becomes apparent. The majority of 
participants recognized the importance of holistic multimodal interventions, 
particularly for the management of physical and psychological symptoms; however, 
only 20% reported that they educated patients and families. Furthermore, 33% of 
participants considered themselves to have provided patients and families with 
sufficient nutritional and exercise interventions and evidence-based 
information.
CONCLUSION: The results reveal that HCPs are not regularly providing education 
and emotional support to patients and families suffering from cancer cachexia. 
The results also show the need for education for HCPs to enhance implementation 
of holistic multimodal interventions for cancer cachexia.

Aim      To assess the prevalence of heart failure (HF) in St. Petersburg from 
2019 through 2021 based on medical reports.Material and methods  Medical records 
of 146 912 patients with HF who were managed in St. Petersburg from 2019 through 
2021 were analyzed. Prevalence of HF was assessed using a standard ICD-10 I 50.x 
code for this disease. Also, expanded HF coding was used with ICD-10 codes 
I09.9, I11.0, I13.0, I13.2, I25.5, I42.0, I42.9, I43.0, I43.1, I43.8, I42.5, 
I42.7, and I42.8. An additional analysis was performed for mortality from 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as a whole and from HF in particular 
(n=192 133).Results From 2019 through 2021, the number of both male and female 
patients with HF increased by 18.14 %. The greatest number of HF patients was in 
the age group of 75-89 years in 2019-2020 and 60-74 years in 2021, with females 
prevailing. The HF incidence increased in the age group of 45-59 years with a 
peak morbidity at age of 60-74 for men and 75-89 for women, which was consistent 
with the life expectancy of each gender. The expanded coding allowed a more 
complete presentation of HF prevalence and also to take into account patients 
with HF caused not only by myocardial infarction or acute cardiac pathology but 
also by rheumatic heart disease, arterial hypertension, myocarditis, and 
cardiomyopathies. Cardiovascular mortality significantly increased by 20.1% 
during the period from 2019 through 2021. The HF prevalence for deceased 
patients also was steadily increasing during 3 years. Analysis of associated 
pathology in HF patients revealed, in most cases, hypertension, ischemic heart 
disease, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and 
obesity.Conclusion      The increase in HF prevalence and mortality draws 
attention and calls for managing measures to change the current situation in 
health care. A registry is required to characterize a typical patient with HF 
and to present an unbiased picture of HF prevalence. It is also necessary to 
develop programs for outpatient follow-up of patients in this category and for 
providing current, highly effective medicines. Education of patients and 
improving the knowledge of therapists in diagnosis and treatment of HF are most 
relevant for enhancing the quality and duration of patients' life and for 
reducing the number of hospitalizations and the HF mortality.

[Whether or not to remove root remnants in frail older adults?].

[Article in Dutch; Abstract available in Dutch from the publisher]

de Smit MJ, Bakker MH, Tams J, Vissink A, Visser A.

Many frail older adults have a poor oral health: unrestorable broken teeth and 
root remnants with open root canals, commonly associated with periapical and 
periodontal inflammation, are often seen. Improving oral health in this growing 
group of frail older adults is a considerable challenge for dental care 
professionals. Dentists are often uncertain how to deal with root remnants and 
unrestorable broken teeth in psychogeriatric and/or medically compromised frail 
older adults. Decisions about the extraction or retention of root remnants 
should not only be made on the basis of preventing pain and inflammation, but 
also on the course of disease, life expectancy, cooperation, laws and 
regulations and other factors that are an issue in geriatric patients but not in 
regular (healthy) patients. To help oral health care professionals in their 
treatment choice for this complex patient group, a decision tree was developed 
in which both root and patient-related factors were included.

Publisher: Veel kwetsbare ouderen hebben een slechte mondgezondheid: afgebroken 
gebitselementen en wortelresten met open wortelkanalen, vaak met apicale en 
parodontale ontstekingen, komen veel voor. Het verbeteren van de mondgezondheid 
in deze groeiende groep ouderen is een uitdaging voor professionele 
mondzorgverleners. Zij weten vaak niet goed wat er met deze wortelresten en 
afgebroken gebitselementen moet gebeuren bij psychogeriatrische en/of medisch 
gecompromitteerde kwetsbare oudere patiënten. Het nemen van een beslissing over 
wel of niet verwijderen is in deze doelgroep niet alleen gebaseerd op voorkomen 
van pijn en ontsteking maar ook op ziektebeloop, levensverwachting, 
coöperativiteit, wet- en regelgeving en andere factoren die in de geriatrische 
doelgroep wel spelen maar niet bij (gezonde) reguliere patiënten. Om 
professionele mondzorgverleners te helpen bij de behandelkeuze in deze complexe 
doelgroep is een beslisboom ontwikkeld waarin factoren op zowel gebitselement- 
en patiëntniveau zijn meegenomen.

BACKGROUND: Maintaining caregivers' quality of life (QoL) is critical to 
sustaining the care needed for cancer patients. One of the interventions applied 
to cancer patients' caregivers is early palliative care (EPC).
AIMS: This systematic review synthesized the implementation of EPC on the QoL of 
caregivers of cancer patients.
METHODS: The search was undertaken using seven electronic databases: Medline, 
Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertation & 
Theses (PQDT). The search strategy integrated relevant terms of early palliative 
care, caregivers, cancer, and quality of life and was conducted until March 14, 
2022. The thematic data analysis approach was used to integrate the results.
RESULTS: Using advanced search features, 4193 studies were obtained on the 
initial search. After screening and quality assessment, eight studies were 
included. Eight studies depicted that EPC interventions were delivered for 
caregivers of patients with advanced cancer, that is, those with a life 
expectancy of at least 4-24 months or considered intermediate to poor prognosis. 
One study provided the intervention for caregivers of patients newly diagnosed 
with cancer. None of the studies had the same protocol or content in delivering 
EPC for caregivers. Four studies gave similar details on addressing the 
strategies for caregivers in several aspects, including physical, psychological, 
social, and spiritual. There was no difference in the QoL between caregivers 
with cancer patients who received EPC compared with usual care. EPC was noted to 
influence other factors, such as caregivers' psychological distress and burden.
LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: The data on EPC interventions portray no beneficial 
effects on the QoL of caregivers with cancer patients. Further studies on 
developing standard protocols of EPC, multidisciplinary team, and how early it 
should be given to caregivers are strongly recommended.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the incremental lifetime effects, 
costs, and net monetary benefit (NMB) of knowing BRCA information by universal 
genetic testing of all US women without breast cancer turning 40 in a given 
year, and the cumulative savings or losses of yearly cohort testing over 
16 years. We compared two strategies: (1) 'with BRCA information' and (2) 
'without BRCA information.'
METHODS: Incremental NMB (INMB) was calculated as the monetized benefit per 
person of knowing BRCA status. The net monetized value (cumulated INMB) of 
knowing BRCA information was estimated by multiplying the INMB with the eligible 
population or the year 2020 cohort of US women age 40 and extended for a total 
of 16 yearly cohorts.
RESULTS: Universal testing of the female population at the age of 40 in a given 
year provided aan INMB of $663/person (payer) and $1,006/person 
(society).Escalated to the U.S. population of women age 40 , knowing BRCA status 
resulted in lifetime cumulated INMB of $1.3 billion (payer) and $2.0 billion 
(society) for the 2020 cohort; and yielded accumulated monetized value of $18.3 
billion (payer) and $27.6 billion (society) over 16 yearly cohorts of 
40-year-old women.
CONCLUSIONS: The universal testing for BRCA status of all US women at age 40 
provides compelling short-term and long-term economic value.

BACKGROUND: Safe and effective vaccination is considered to be the most critical 
strategy to fight coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to individual and 
herd immunity protection. We aimed to systematically review the economic 
evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination globally.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search to identify relevant studies in two 
major databases (MEDLINE/PubMed and EBSCO) published until September 8, 2022. 
After deduplication, two researchers independently screened the study titles and 
abstracts according to pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The 
remaining full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. We assessed their 
quality of reporting using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting 
Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist and summarized and narratively presented the 
results.
RESULTS: We identified 25 studies that assessed the economic evaluation of 
COVID-19 vaccination worldwide by considering several input parameters, 
including vaccine cost, vaccine efficacy, utility value, and the size of the 
targeted population. All studies suggested that COVID-19 vaccination was a 
cost-effective or cost-saving intervention for mitigating coronavirus 
transmission and its effect in many countries within certain conditions. Most 
studies reported vaccine efficacy values ranging from 65% to 75%.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the favorable cost-effectiveness profile of COVID-19 vaccines 
and disparities in affordability across countries, considering prioritization 
has become paramount. This review provides comprehensive insights into the 
economic evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination that will be useful to policymakers, 
particularly in highlighting preventive measures and preparedness plans for the 
next possible pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Sustainable employability (SE) has become an important factor for 
keeping people in the labour market and enabling the extension of working life.
AIMS: We developed and validated an SE index to predict assured workability in 2 
years. Additionally, we developed a scoring tool to use in practice.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey of postal employees aged ≥50 years was conducted 
in 2016 and followed up in 2018 (n = 1102). The data were divided into training 
and validation sets. The outcome was defined as whether the employees had an 
assured workability after 2 years or not. Multivariable log-binomial regression 
was used to calculate the SE index. The area under the curve (AUC) was 
calculated to assess the discriminative power of the index.
RESULTS: The probability of assured workability increased with increasing 
quintiles of the SE index. The highest quintiles of the SE index showed the 
highest observed and expected assured workability in 2 years. The predictive 
ability, area under the curve (AUC) for training was 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.83) and 
for validation data was 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.80). In the scoring tool, the 
self-rated health, workability, job satisfaction and perceived employment had 
the highest contribution to the index.
CONCLUSIONS: The SE index was able to distinguish the employees based on whether 
they had assured workability after 2 years. The scoring method could be used to 
calculate the potentiality of future employability among late midlife postal 
employees.

We study the impact of health insurance expansion on medical spending, longevity 
and welfare in an OLG economy in which individuals purchase health care to lower 
mortality and medical progress is profit-driven. Three sectors are considered: 
final goods production; a health care sector, selling medical services to 
individuals; and an R&D sector, selling increasingly effective medical 
technology to the health care sector. We calibrate the model to the development 
of the US economy/health care system from 1965 to 2005 and study numerically the 
impact of the insurance expansion. We find that more extensive health insurance 
accounts for a large share of the rise in US health spending but also boosts the
