stems from inadequate knowledge about the benefits and harms of cancer screening 
and indicates a need for education or decision support. Other reasons for 
disagreement highlight the need to refine the current recommended cancer 
screening approaches and identify strategies to avoid unintended consequences, 
such as introducing bias or exacerbating existing disparities. J Am Geriatr Soc

Lutjanid snappers belonging to the subfamilies Apsilinae and Etelinae are 
commercially valuable components of tropical deep-water fisheries throughout 
much of the Indo-Pacific region. Based on age assessment using sagittal 
otoliths, the age-specific demographic characteristics of four deep-water 
snappers, Etelis coruscans, Paracaesio caerulea, Pristipomoides filamentosus and 
Pristipomoides sieboldii, in the Okinawa Islands, southwestern Japan, were 
examined, and the results were discussed for fishery management. Age validation 
using edge-type analysis demonstrated that opaque zones in all species were 
formed once per year and were considered valid annual growth increments. The von 
Bertalanffy growth equations were also determined for each species. These 
snappers are long-lived (>50 years for E. coruscans and P. caerulea 
and >30 years for the two species of Pristipomoides) and relatively 
slow-growing. The age of acquiring sexual maturity in females was relatively 
later in E. coruscans, P. caerulea and P. filamentosus than in P. sieboldii. The 
results revealed differences in the biological traits among these four species; 
E. coruscans and P. caerulea with long life spans and late maturation are 
particularly more vulnerable to fishing impact than the two Pristipomoides 
species. Therefore, further approaches to decrease and control fishing 
intensity, such as networking of marine-protected areas and regulation to 
control the numbers of boats and/or the total allowable catch, are necessary for 
the management of the stock of these species, especially for E. coruscans and P. 
caerulea.

USA.

Environmental characteristics can influence aging. Democracy results in higher 
life expectancy for its members. However, there is a lack of research that 
indicates the influence of democracy on its leaders. Specifically, we examine 
how the nature of democracy affects the perceived aging of its leaders. In this 
paper, we capture perceived aging via face perception. We suggest that leaders 
in a democracy are perceived to age more compared to those in an autocracy. 
Counter to the common belief that democracies are less stressful, we find that 
the stress of being a leader in a democracy can have adverse effects. Study 1 
uses picture pairs of 268 leaders from across the world, and participants judge 
age difference in years between the pictures. Study 2, a controlled study, 
examines downstream influences on the leader's specific attributes. Results 
indicate that leaders appearing to age more are more likely to avoid complex 
decisions, to be less charismatic, and to be less inspiring.

PURPOSE: Globally, years of life lost are declining, while years lived with 
disability are increasing. In high socio-demographic index countries, this trend 
has been attributed to an overall ageing population and rehabilitation services 
have begun to adjust to this change. In low- and middle-income countries, this 
trend is less well understood. Hence, the WHO's 'Rehabilitation 2030 Call for 
Action' and 'Rehabilitation in Health Systems Guide' call for better assessment 
of the situation. In order to understand trends and causes in middle income 
countries such as Botswana, we examine the change over time in causes and number 
of years lived with disability and years of life lost.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2017 
data, exploring the change over time in Disability Adjusted Life Years per 
100 000 people over the period 1990-2016. The descriptive analysis focuses on 
the contribution of years lived with disability towards the burden of disease 
within Botswana compared with the world, sub-Saharan Africa, and high-income 
countries.
RESULTS: Our results show that Botswana's top causes of years of life lost are 
HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, cardiovascular diseases, maternal 
and neonatal disorders, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and neoplasms. 
Years lived with disability have increased over time, which is driven by mental 
disorders, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, musculoskeletal 
disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Botswana needs better data to prepare its emerging health systems 
to accommodate the increased need for disability support and rehabilitation 
services caused by communicable and non-communicable diseases.Implications for 
RehabilitationBotswana has an increase in disability prevalence over time that 
requires the development of disability and rehabilitation services.The greatest 
contributors towards disability adjusted life years in Botswana are currently 
mental disorders (13.7%), HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases, (13.0%), 
musculoskeletal disorders (9.9%), neurological disorders (8.0%), and sense organ 
diseases (6.2%).This requires strengthen of services such as mental health 
interventions, physiotherapy, optometry and audiology as well as linkages from 
major disease clusters such as HIV to rehabilitation services.

Objective: To investigate the current status and changes of disease burden of 
cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in 1990 and 2016 for Beijing people. Methods: 
Using the results of the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to 
describe deaths status and disease burden of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in 
Beijing. The measurement index included the total deaths, years of life lost due 
to premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and 
disability-adjusted years (DALY). Using the average world population from 2000 
to 2025 as standard population to calculate the age-standardized mortality rate, 
DALY rate, YLL rate and YLD rate. Results: The age-standardized mortality rate 
of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases was 209.24 per 100 000. In 2016, DALY, YLL 
and YLD of cardio-cerebrovascular was 875.6, 733.6 and 142.0 thousand 
person-years, respectively, which has increased by 58.05%, 44.24% and 213.47%, 
respectively, than that in 1990. The age-standardized DALY rate and 
age-standardized YLL rate of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in 2016 was 3 
552.24 and 2 988.01 per 100 000 which has decreased by 47.90% and 52.43%, 
respectively, than that in 1990. The age-standardized YLD rate of 
cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in 2016 was 564.23 per 100 000 which increased 
by 5.10% than that in 1990. In 2016, the total death of cerebrovascular disease 
and ischemic heart disease was 17.6 thousand and 23.7 thousand, respectively. 
DALY was 396.3 and 393.6 thousand person-years in 2016, while 330.2 and 162.7 
thousand person-years in 1990, which has increased by 20.02% and 141.92%, 
respectively. Conclusions: The disease burden of cardio-cerebrovascular disease 
is serious, especially the burden of cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart 
disease. The disability burden of cerebrovascular disease is serious. The 
disease burden of ischemic heart disease has multiplied.

Aortitis and periaortitis are inflammatory diseases of the aorta and its main 
branches; they differ in the extension of inflammation, which is confined to the 
aortic wall in aortitis, and spreads to the periaortic space in periaortitis. 
Aortitis is classified as non-infectious or infectious. Non-infectious aortitis 
represents a common feature of large-vessel vasculitides but can also be 
isolated or associated with other rheumatologic conditions. Periaortitis can be 
idiopathic or secondary to a wide array of etiologies such as drugs, infections, 
malignancies, and other proliferative diseases. Notably, both aortitis and 
periaortitis may arise in the context of IgG4-related disease, a recently 
characterised fibro-inflammatory systemic disease. Prompt recognition, correct 
diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential in order to avoid 
life-threatening complications.

BACKGROUND: Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair endograft 
(f/bEVAR) allows the endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal and juxtarenal and 
pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (T-J-P-AAAs); however, given their high 
cost and complexity, their use should be limited to patients with life 
expectancy >2 years. Nevertheless, the number of patients older than 80 years 
treated by f/bEVAR is growing, with no hard evidence of the real efficacy in 
this context. The aim of the present study is to analyze the survival of 
≥80-year-old patients treated with f/bEVAR, and to identify possible predictors 
of late mortality.
METHODS: An analysis of clinical, anatomical, and technical characteristics of 
patients treated with f/bEVAR for J-, P-, and T-AAA from 2010 to 2019 in a 
single academic center was performed. Follow-up data were collected 
prospectively with clinical visit and computed tomography angiography at 
discharge, after 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Survival after 2 years was 
evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Possible predictors of mortality were 
evaluated by univariable/multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: In the study period, a total of 243 f/bEVARs were considered: 83 for 
TAAA (34%) and 160 for J/PAAA (66%). Mean age was 73 ± 6 years, with 35 (14%) 
patients ≥80 years old; 209 patients (86%) were male and 78 (39%) had an 
American Society of Anesthesiology score IV. The 30-day and 2-year survival were 
96% and 80 ± 3%, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 36 ± 25 months, 
independent predictors of late mortality by Cox regression analysis were chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal failure (CRF), and ≥80 years 
old (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-3.2, P = 0.05; HR 
1.7, 95% CI 1.01-3.4, P = 0.04; HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.3, P = 0.002, 
respectively). Preoperative clinical characteristics were similar in ≥80 years 
old versus younger patients, except for the prevalence of TAAA (14% vs. 38%, 
P = 0.04). The technical success and 30-day mortality were similar in ≥80 vs. 
<80-year-old patients (93% vs. 96%, P = 0.31; 7% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.60, 
respectively). The 2-year survival estimation was significantly lower in ≥80 
years old compared with younger patients (62 ± 10% vs. 82 ± 3%, P = 0.003). The 
association of COPD and CRF significantly affects the 2-year survival in 
≥80-year-old patients (no patients survived at 2 years) and was significantly 
different compared with the survival in ≥80-year-old patients without these risk 
factors (70 ± 11%, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The early mortality rate and the 2-year survival after f/bEVAR 
justify this type of treatment in patients ≥80 years old; however, the presence 
of comorbidities such as COPD and CRF significantly reduces mid-term survival in 
this group and should be taken into consideration in the indication to f/bEVAR.

BACKGROUND: Children at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) (>6% over 5 
years) receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), but no 
guidelines are available for those at lower risk. For children at intermediate 
risk for SCD (4%-6% over 5 years), the utility and cost-effectiveness of in-home 
automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
in-home AED for children at intermediate risk for SCD.
METHODS: Using hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as the proxy disease, a 
theoretical cohort of 1550 ten-year-old children with HCM was followed for 69 
years. Baseline annual risk of SCD was 0.8%. Outcomes were SCD, severe 
neurologic morbidity (SNM), cost, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Model 
inputs were derived from the literature, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: Among children at intermediate risk for SCD, in-home AED resulted in 31 
fewer cases of SCD but 3 more cases of SNM. There were 319 QALYs gained. 
Although costs were higher by $28 million, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was $86,458, which is below the willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSION: For children at intermediate risk for SCD and HCM, in-home AED is 
cost-effective, resulting in fewer deaths and increased QALYS for a cost below 
the willingness-to-pay threshold. These findings highlight the economic benefits 
of in-home AED use in this population.

The elderly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population consists of both elderly-onset 
RA that manifests after the age of 60 and individuals diagnosed with RA early in 
life who age naturally to become members of this group. The elderly RA 
population is expanding due to both increased life expectancy and an increased 
incidence of elderly onset RA. Elderly onset RA seems to have a characteristic 
clinical pattern and perhaps biological profile different to that of early onset 
RA. The management of RA in elderly patients can be challenging, as robust 
treat-to-target approaches must be balanced against the adverse events due to 
increased comorbidities in old age. This produces a tendency to prefer less 
aggressive treatment in elderly RA patients in clinical practice. Despite the 
concerns about adverse events, there is limited evidence on the best way to 
approach RA in this population, as elderly patients are often not well presented 
in the clinical trials. Herein, we review the literature to assess the efficacy 
and safety of RA therapies in this age group. We then suggest a tailored 
approach that can be adopted in clinical practice, based on the disease severity 
and risk profiles of elderly RA patients.

OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer detection by low-dose computed tomographic screening 
reduces mortality. However, it is essential to assess cost-effectiveness. We 
present a cost-effectiveness analysis of screening in Italians at high risk of 
lung cancer, from the point of view of the Italian tax-payer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a decision model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of annual screening for 5 years in smokers (≥30 pack-years) 
of 55-79 years. Patients diagnosed in the COSMOS study were the screening arm; 
patients diagnosed and treated for lung cancer in the Lombardy Region, Italy, 
constituted the usual care arm. Treatment costs were extracted from our hospital 
database. Lung cancer survival in screened patients was adjusted for 2-year 
lead-time bias. Life-years and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated by 
stage at diagnosis, from which incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per 
life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gained were estimated.
RESULTS: Base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 3297 and 2944 euro 
per quality-adjusted life-year and life-year gained, respectively. Deterministic 
sensitivity analysis indicated that these values were particularly sensitive to 
lung cancer prevalence, screening sensitivity and specificity, screening cost, 
and treatment costs for stage I and IV disease. From the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis incremental cost-effectiveness ratios had a 98 % 
probability of being <25,000 euro (widely-accepted threshold) and a 55 % 
probability of being <5000 euro.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose computed tomographic screening is associated with an 
incremental cost of 2944 euro per life-year gained in high risk population, 
implying that screening can be introduced in Italy at contained cost, saving the 
lives of many lung cancer patients.

BACKGROUND/AIM: We evaluated the diagnostic value of functional imaging with 
[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed 
tomography (PET/CT) for the identification of extranodal extension (ENE) in 
patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 94 patients with HNSCC who underwent 
FDG-PET/CT were enrolled. We recorded the maximum standardized uptake value 
(SUVmax), compared the results with pathologic findings, and evaluated the 
diagnostic performance of using a SUVmax cut-off value for ENE.
RESULTS: Of the 566 dissected levels examined, 53 (9.4%) exhibited ENE. The mean 
SUVmax of LN with and without ENE were 6.67 and 1.64, respectively (p<0.001). A 
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis for SUVmax showed an 
area under the ROC curve of 0.913. A SUVmax cut-off of 3.0 achieved diagnostic 
performance for identifying ENE with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 
81.1%, 94.3% and 93.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: FDG-PET/CT findings using a SUVmax cut-off of 3.0 provides 
appropriate diagnostic value in identifying ENE.

PURPOSE: Japan is one of few countries with a male life expectancy over 80 
years. The gap between the healthy life span and the total life expectancy is 
large, highlighting the importance of maintaining physical performance. The 
present study aims to establish reference values for multiple physical 
performance measures among high-functioning oldest-old Japanese men and to 
investigate the correlations among these measurements to understand how these 
variables are related.
METHODS: This study was conducted with 120 Japanese males aged 80 years or older 
who were able to walk independently. Seven measures of physical performance were 
assessed: handgrip strength, quadriceps strength, static balance ability 
(one-legged stance), dynamic balance ability (Functional Reach Test; FRT), 
walking ability (5-m walking time test), combined movement ability (Timed Up & 
Go test), and bone quality. Cognitive function was also measured (Mini-Mental 
State Examination; MMSE).
RESULTS: Specific reference values are reported for each physical performance 
measurement explored in this study. Only six participants were classified as 
cognitively impaired, and 16 had mild cognitive impairment. There were 
significant correlations of varying levels among all of the measures of physical 
performance. Age was significantly correlated with all performance measures 
except FRT, and there was no correlation between age and MMSE. MMSE was weakly 
correlated with FRT and unrelated to the other performance measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The reference ranges can be used by older men who have not yet 
reached 80 years and their health care providers as physical performance targets 
to facilitate the maintenance of independent mobility in later life.

OBJECTIVE: To achieve the goal of "healthy China 2030", reasonable health 
policies must be developed based on the changes of death spectrum. We aim to 
investigate the temporal patterns of life expectancy (LE) and age/cause-specific 
contributions from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: Joinpoint regression model was used with Arriaga's decomposition 
method.
RESULTS: LE in China has reached to 76.3 years in 2016 with an increase of 9.44 
years from 1990. From 1990 to 2002, a remarkable reduction in infant mortality 
accounted for an increase of 1.27 years (35.39%) to LE which mainly resulted 
from diarrhea, lower respiratory, and other common infectious diseases (1.00 
years, 27.79%). After 2002, those aged 65+ years contributed most to increased 
LE and the most prominent causes included cardiovascular diseases (0.67 years, 
23.36%), chronic respiratory diseases (0.54 years, 18.76%) and neoplasms (0.39 
years, 13.44%). Moreover, the effects of transport injuries changed from 
negative to positive. After 2007, contributions of transport and unintentional 
injuries increased especially for males. And for females contributions of 
cardiovascular diseases sharply increased LE by 1.17 years (32.26%).
CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to cardiovascular diseases, chronic 
respiratory diseases and neoplasms which were mainly attributed to the increase 
of LE, especially for males and elderly population.

AIM: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the neuromusculoskeletal late side 
effects and their impact on the quality of life of patients with nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma treated with radiochemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were included. The mean follow-up 
was 61 months (range, 18-111 months). The median external radiotherapy dose 
applied to the nasopharynx and primary tumor was 70 Gy (range, 61-73 Gy). The 
mean dose received by the temporomandibular joint in the dose-volume histograms 
of these patients was 60.7 Gy. The maximal doses of the muscles responsible for 
cervical motion in different ranges were greater than 60 Gy, and the mean doses 
were greater than 40 Gy in the muscle groups, except for the extensor muscles.
RESULTS: Two patients had brachial plexus involvement, while 89% of the patients 
had restriction in flexion and extension movements. Of the patients, 52% had 
trismus. There was a significant correlation between extension restriction and 
general heath score and the physical subscale of the quality-of-life 
questionnaire (p = 0.01). There was also a correlation between trismus and pain 
killer usage (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to analyze long-term muscle and nerve 
toxicity and their correlation between doses in nasopharyngeal cancer patients 
following radiochemotherapy. Despite the advances in radiotherapy techniques, it 
is necessary to pay attention to the doses of the nerves and muscles for late 
effects.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When measuring inequalities in health, public health and 
addiction research has tended to focus on differences in average life-span 
between socio-economic groups. This does not account for the extent to which age 
of death varies between individuals within socio-economic groups or whether this 
variation differs between groups. This study assesses (1) socio-economic 
inequalities in both average life-span and variation in age at death, (2) the 
extent to which these inequalities can be attributed to alcohol-specific causes 
(i.e. those attributable only to alcohol) and (3) how this contribution has 
changed over time.
DESIGN: Cause-deleted life table analysis of national mortality records.
SETTING: England and Wales, 2001-16.
CASES: All-cause and alcohol-specific deaths for all adults aged 18+, stratified 
by sex, age and quintiles of the index of multiple deprivation (IMD).
MEASUREMENTS: Life expectancy at age 18 yearss and standard deviation in age at 
death within IMD quintiles and the contribution of alcohol to overall 
differences in both measures between the highest and lowest IMD quintiles by 
comparing observed and cause-deleted inequality 'gaps'.
FINDINGS: In 2016, alcohol-specific causes reduced life expectancy for men and 
women by 0.26 and 0.14 years, respectively, and increased the standard deviation 
in age at death. These causes also increased the inequality gap in life 
expectancy by 0.33 years for men and 0.17 years for women, and variation in age 
at death by 0.14 years and 0.13 years, respectively. For both measures, the 
contribution of alcohol to mortality inequalities rose after 2001 and 
subsequently fell back. For women, alcohol accounted for 3.6% of inequality in 
age at death and 6.0% of life-span uncertainty, suggesting that using only the 
former may underestimate alcohol-induced inequalities. There was no comparable 
difference for men.
CONCLUSIONS: Deaths from alcohol-specific causes increase inequalities in both 
life expectancy and variation in age of death between socio-economic groups. 
Using both measures can provide a fuller picture of overall inequalities in 
health.

BACKGROUND: As the causal agent of pine wilt disease, Bursaphelenchus 
xylophilus, is a serious pathogen of forest pine trees. Esteya vermicola is a 
nematophagous fungus of B. xylophilus and exhibits great potential as a 
biological control agent. However, the in vivo infection mechanism of E. 
vermicola on B. xylophilus is unclear. Experiments were conducted to study the 
colonization of host plant and infection of B. xylophilus by E. vermicola inside 
pine tree xylem.
RESULTS: A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged E. vermicola transformant was 
constructed as a biomarker to study the in vivo colonization and infection of B. 
xylophilus in pine trees. The in vitro infection of B. xylophilus by E. 
vermicola was observed through GFP expression. The bacilloid conidia produced by 
trophic hyphae in the body of the nematode are described. Additionally, the 
monitoring of in vivo colonization by GFP-tagged E. vermicola showed the 
germination and hyphal extension of this fungus after inoculation. Moreover, B. 
xylophilus infected by this biocontrol agent were extracted from healthy 
seedlings and observed in the xylem of trees that were wilting due to pine wilt 
disease.
CONCLUSION: Evidence of fungal colonization and infection of B. xylophilus by E. 
vermicola is provided to improve our understanding of the in vivo infection 
mechanisms used by this nematophagous fungus against B. xylophilus. The 
infection of B. xylophilus by E. vermicola was inferred to begin with the 
implantation of propagules, and this inference will require future 
investigation. The colonization of Esteya vermicola in host pine tree xylem and 
the in vivo infection of pinewood nematode by E. vermicola were investigated 
using the green fluorescence protein transformant. © 2020 Society of Chemical

OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of the change in mortality by AIDS in life 
expectancy at birth of Spanish population in 1985-2017.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 56 863 deaths by AIDS. We calculated 
age-standardized death rates, and we applied Poisson regression and 
decomposition of life expectancies.
RESULTS: From 1985 to 1995, mortality by AIDS contributed to reduce life 
expectancy at birth of 0.64 years for men, and 0.17 for women; in 1996-2017, 
increase it by 0.60 years, men, and 0.17, women.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 
and prevention were decisive to reduce mortality by AIDS and to become chronic 
the epidemic.

This study examined racial/ethnic, nativity, and country of origin differences 
in life expectancy with and without functional limitations among older adults in 
the United States. We used data from the National Health Interview Survey 
(1999-2015) to estimate Sullivan-based life tables of life expectancies with 
functional limitations and without functional limitations by sex for U.S.-born 
Mexicans, foreign-born Mexicans, U.S.-born Puerto Ricans, island-born Puerto 
Ricans, foreign-born Cubans, and U.S.-born Whites. We find that Latinos exhibit 
heterogeneous life expectancies with functional limitations. Among females, 
U.S.-born Mexicans, foreign-born Mexicans, and foreign-born Cubans spend 
significantly fewer years without functional limitations, whereas island-born 
Puerto Ricans spend more years with functional limitations. For men, U.S.-born 
Puerto Ricans were the only Latino subgroup disadvantaged in the number of years 
lived with functional limitations. Conversely, foreign-born Cubans spend 
significantly fewer years without functional limitations. To address disparities 
in functional limitations, we must consider variation in health among Latino 
subgroups.

BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass 
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) biotyping is an innovative strategy, applied 
successfully for the identification of numerous arthropod families including 
mosquitoes. The effective mosquito identification using this emerging tool was 
demonstrated possible at different steps of their life-cycle, including eggs, 
immature and adult stages. Unfortunately, for species identification by MS, the 
euthanasia of the mosquito specimen is required.
METHODS: To avoid mosquito euthanasia, the present study assessed whether aedine 
mosquitoes could be identified by MALDI-TOF MS biotyping, using their respective 
exuviae. In this way, exuviae from the fourth-instar and pupal stages of Aedes 
albopictus and Aedes aegypti were submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis.
RESULTS: Reproducible and specific MS spectra according to aedine species and 
stage of exuviae were observed which were objectified by cluster analyses, 
composite correlation index (CCI) tool and principal components analysis (PCA). 
The query of our reference MS spectra database (DB) upgraded with MS spectra of 
exuviae from fourth-instar larvae and pupae of both Aedes species revealed that 
100% of the samples were correctly classified at the species and stage levels. 
Among them, 93.8% (135/144) of the MS profiles reached the threshold log score 
value (LSV > 1.8) for reliable identification.
CONCLUSIONS: The extension of reference MS spectra DB to exuviae from 
fourth-instar and pupal stages made now possible the identification of 
mosquitoes throughout their life-cycle at aquatic and aerial stages. The exuviae 
presenting the advantage to avoid specimen euthanasia, allowing to perform 
complementary analysis on alive mosquitoes.

OBJECTIVE: According to the WHO coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation report 
35, as of 24th February 2020, there was a total of 77,262 confirmed COVID-19 
cases in China. That included 2595 deaths. The specific objective of this study 
was to estimate the fiscal value of human lives lost due to COVID-19 in China as 
of 24th February 2020.
RESULTS: The deaths from COVID-19 had a discounted (at 3%) total fiscal value of 
Int$ 924,346,795 in China. Out of which, 63.2% was borne by people aged 
25-49 years, 27.8% by people aged 50-64 years, and 9.0% by people aged 65 years 
and above. The average fiscal value per death was Int$ 356,203. Re-estimation of 
the economic model alternately with 5% and 10 discount rates led to a reduction 
in the expected total fiscal value by 21.3% and 50.4%, respectively. 
Furthermore, the re-estimation of the economic model using the world's highest 
average life expectancy of 87.1 years (which is that of Japanese females), 
instead of the national life expectancy of 76.4 years, increased the total 
fiscal value by Int$ 229,456,430 (24.8%).

INTRODUCTION: Sao Tome and Principe is an African low-and-middle-income country, 
where extreme poverty causes major health inequalities. No systematic research 
has been done on the consumption of alcohol and drugs in Sao Tome and Principe, 
and only overall statistics are available based on the importation of alcoholic 
drinks and their distribution among the population. There are also no studies on 
consumption of alcohol and illicit substances in children and youth and no 
preventive measures being undertaken. Besides that, manual databases present 
significant limitations, considering the lack of causes associated with 
mortality rates (0 - 5 years and > 5), and the difficulty to establish a 
cause/effect relation between diseases, deaths and life expectancy. No relevant 
data with burden of life was found in the reports of Centro Nacional de Endemias 
or the non-governmental, organization Instituto Marques de Valle Flor, a 
facilitator on healthcare clinical specialties selected on a voluntary basis by 
doctors from Portuguese hospitals. So, we proposed to provide a first overview 
of family and housing conditions, and above all, the consumption of alcohol and 
illegal drugs in young people. Thus, a project, the National Survey on Harmful 
Consumption of Alcohol and Drugs in Schools of Sao Tome and Principe, will be 
realized in order to better characterize the situation among children and young 
students and test public health communication strategies and preventive 
interventions aimed at this target-population. Interventions were designed 
taking into consideration local sociocultural realities of target audiences. We 
considered dialect language, single-parent families (matriarchal structure) and 
polygamy (mostly) in men and a country and governments led by men (patriarchal 
structure) and, in which the woman's role, as Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations reports, remains overlooked. Subsequently, we will collect 
traditional alcohols samples from the two main islands for analysis (at 
Laboratório de Estudos Farmacêuticos and Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia 
Civil - Portugal) and to determine heavy metals in the production process and 
impact on burden of life.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to characterise the country's situation in terms 
of alcohol and illicit substances consumption a literature review was carried 
out through a search in several international electronic databases, such as 
those of the World Health Organization, World Health Organization Africa, United 
Nation, The Lancet and Lancet Global Health, etc. Available data of the 
following institutions of Sao Tome and Príncipe was also analyzed: National 
Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Education, Culture and Training and
