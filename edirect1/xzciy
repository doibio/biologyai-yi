overexpression, consequently leading to the increase of PAK1 phosphorylation, 
neurite extension, BrdU/NeuN- and Dcx-positive populations, and MAP-2 
expression. Behavioral symptoms of depression following cranial irradiation were 
also relieved by treatment of allantoin and neferine. These findings demonstrate 
that TTR plays a critical role in neurogenesis after irradiation, and allantoin 
and neferine could be potential drug candidates for recovering the effects of 
radiation on neurogenesis and depression.

As life expectancy increases, elderly populations tend to spend an increasing 
number of years in poor health, with chronic age-related diseases and 
disability. Therefore, the development of therapeutic strategies to treat or 
prevent multiple pathophysiological conditions in the elderly may improve 
health-adjusted life expectancy and alleviate the potential economic and social 
burdens arising from age-related diseases. Bioactive natural products might 
represent promising new drug candidates for the treatment of many chronic 
age-related diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular 
disease, obesity, and liver disease. Here, we discuss a therapeutic option using 
saikosaponins, which are triterpene saponins isolated from Bupleurum, against a 
variety of age-related diseases. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of 
natural products like saikosaponins in the treatment of age-related diseases may 
help in the development of diverse natural product-derived compounds that may be 
effective against a number of chronic health problems.

BACKGROUND: Excessive postoperative opioid prescription is a source of 
prescription diversion in the United States opioid crisis and may contribute to 
chronic opioid use. Efficient prescription by the surgeon can mitigate opioid 
abuse and improve postoperative pain control. In this study we sought to better 
characterize the incidence and predictive baseline characteristics associated 
with the need for additional opioid prescription after endoscopic sinus surgery 
(ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on subjects undergoing ambulatory 
ESS between November 2016 and August 2017. The medical and Controlled Substance 
Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) records were reviewed. Uni- and 
multivariable logistic regressions were performed to evaluate factors associated 
with additional opioid prescription within 60 days of surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 121 patients were included. Additional prescriptions were 
seen in 22 patients (18%). Surgical factors, including sinuses operated, 
septoplasty, revision, or extended procedure (Draf IIB/III), were not associated 
with additional prescription. On multivariate logistic regression, preoperative 
opioid use (odds ratio [OR], 23.45; 95% CI, 1.52-362.63), greater number of 
prescribed tablets (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26), and lower preoperative health 
status (ASA score) (OR, 11.21; 95% CI, 1.49-84.30) were associated with 
additional prescription (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A need for extension of postoperative opioid pain control is not 
uncommon after ESS. Patient baseline clinical characteristics are predictive of 
a need for re-prescription of opioids. Surgical extent is not associated with 
need for prolonged postoperative opioid pain management.

The importance of genome replication has inspired detailed crystallographic 
studies of enzymatic DNA/RNA polymerization. In contrast, the mechanism of 
nonenzymatic polymerization is less well understood, despite its critical role 
in the origin of life. Here we report the direct observation of nonenzymatic RNA 
primer extension through time-resolved crystallography. We soaked crystals of an 
RNA primer-template-dGMP complex with guanosine-5'-phosphoro-2-aminoimidazolide 
for increasing times. At early times we see the activated ribonucleotides bound 
to the template, followed by formation of the imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide 
intermediate. At later times, we see a new phosphodiester bond forming between 
the primer and the incoming nucleotide. The intermediate is pre-organized 
because of the constraints of base-pairing with the template and hydrogen 
bonding between the imidazole amino group and both flanking phosphates. Our 
results provide atomic-resolution insight into the mechanism of nonenzymatic 
primer extension, and set the stage for further structural dissection and 
optimization of the RNA copying process.

OBJECTIVES: The trends of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality 
and prevalence from 1990 to 2015 in Hubei province of mid-China remain unknown. 
We used findings from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study to estimate 
the COPD burden and attributable to risk factors in Hubei province of China from 
1990 to 2015.
STUDY DESIGN: The GBD study uses various analytical tools and a diverse set of 
data sources to generate comparable estimates of deaths and mortality rates 
broken down by age, sex, cause, year, and geography.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the GBD 2015 study. Statistical models were 
used to produce comprehensive results of COPD deaths, prevalence, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost, years lived with a 
disability, and attributable to risk factors in Hubei. The median of the percent 
change and 95% uncertainty intervals were determined for the period between 1990 
and 2015.
RESULTS: In 2015, there were 37,144 deaths from COPD in Hubei, accounting for 
10.05% of the total deaths in Hubei. The age-standardized COPD death rate was 
reduced by 60.28% from 188.67 per 100,000 (in 1990) to 74.94 per 100,000 (in 
2015). The age-standardized prevalence decreased from 4.30% (1990) to 2.85% 
(2015). By 2015, the leading risk factors for all ages COPD DALYs were smoking 
and ambient particulate matter pollution, accounting for 44.69% and 32.91%, 
respectively. The proportion of ambient ozone pollution was increasing steadily 
each year since 1990.
CONCLUSION: Hubei has made substantial progress in reducing the mortality due to 
COPD since 1990, but the absolute number of COPD cases is increasing steadily, 
given the population growth and aging. The increasing contribution from smoking, 
ambient particulate matter pollution, and ambient ozone pollution should require 
growing attention.

Ractopamine has been allowed by some countries as a repartitioning additive in 
pig diet, since it promotes protein synthesis and fat lipolysis. Most regulatory 
agencies only propose the ractopamine assessment in meat, kidney, liver and fat. 
Aiming at contributing to the scarcity data regarding this analyte in pig lungs, 
we extended the scope of a LC-MS method to evaluate pig offals. Homogenized 
tissue samples were extracted by a QuEChERS procedure; following by clean up 
steps and further tandem mass spectrometry determination. Method performance was 
evaluated through specificity, recovery, linearity, reproducibility, 
repeatability, decision limit (CCα), and detection capability (CCβ), in 
accordance to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Regression coefficients (R2) 
between 0.994 and 0.999 were achieved for kidney, liver and lungs. Recoveries 
ranged from 92.0 to 127%. CCα and CCβ values ranged from 3.65 to 4.86 μg kg-1, 
and from 6.27 to 7.21 μg kg-1, respectively. These values were under the maximum 
residue limits suggested by Codex Alimentarius, which are 90 and 40 μg kg-1 for 
kidney and liver, respectively. When applied to real samples up to 22.5, 92 and 
1003 μg kg-1 of ractopamine residues were detected in pig liver, kidney and 
lungs, respectively. The results allowed concluding that the proposed analytical 
method is capable to detect ractopamine residues in all evaluated matrices. 
Therefore, it can be successfully applied and used as a routine method in 
laboratories of residue analysis.

BACKGROUND: Older adults and women have historically been underrepresented in 
randomized controlled trials of cardiology. Recent temporal evolution and 
factors influencing representation are incompletely investigated. We aimed to 
contrast age and female representation in the most influential randomized 
controlled trials in cardiology of the last 20 years to population prevalence 
and to assess the study factors affecting representation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Web of Science, we selected the 25 most-cited 
cardiology articles each year between 1996 and 2015, and extracted mean age, 
percentage of women, funding source, sample size, disease condition, 
intervention type, and exclusion criteria. The outcomes were the evolution of 
the mean age and the percentage of women over time. Protocol design elements and 
year of publication were assessed as predictors of outcomes in multivariable 
regressions. A total of 500 studies were analyzed, where the mean age was 
62.6±7.4 years and the median percentage of women was 28.6% (22.2-40.5). 
Compared with population prevalence derived from National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey 2015-2016, gaps in representation were apparent and more 
pronounced for coronary artery disease (-5.0 years; -27.2% women) and heart 
failure (-6.0 years; -25.4% women). The mean age (0.15 year per year; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.04-0.26) and percentage of women (+0.29% per year; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.07-0.50), slightly but significantly increased over time. 
Private funding, small sample size, and exclusions pertaining to maximal age, 
atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus were associated with a decreased mean 
age in multivariable linear regressions. Age and life expectancy exclusions were 
associated with lower female percentage.
CONCLUSIONS: Although age and female representation increased over time, the 
modest trends are unlikely to resolve the persistently wide gaps with actual 
populational prevalence, especially for coronary artery disease and HF. 
Representation is modulated by the cardiovascular condition studied and some 
modifiable protocol elements.

BACKGROUND: One of the functions of the reformed Cancer Drugs Fund in England is 
as a managed access fund, providing conditional funding for cancer drugs where 
there is uncertainty in the economic case, and where that uncertainty can be 
addressed by data collection during two years' use in the NHS. Our study 
characterises likely sources of such uncertainty, through a review of recent 
NICE Technology Appraisals.
METHODS: Discussions of uncertainty in NICE Appraisal Committees were extracted 
from published Single Technology Appraisals of cancer drugs, 2014-2016, and 
categorised inductively. The location of the comments within the structured 
Appraisal document was used as a proxy for the degree of concern shown by the 
Committee.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine appraisals were analysed, of which 23 (79%) were 
recommended for funding. Six main sources of uncertainty were identified. 
Immaturity of survival data, and issues relating to comparators, were common 
sources of uncertainty regardless of degree of concern. Uncertainties relating 
to quality of life, and the patient population in the trial, were discussed 
frequently but rarely occurred in the more uncertain appraisals. Concerns with 
trial design, and cost uncertainty, were less common, but a high proportion 
contributed to the most uncertain appraisals. Funding decisions were not driven 
by uncertainty in the evidence base, but by the expected cost per QALY relative 
to acceptance thresholds, and the resultant level of uncertainty in the 
decision.
CONCLUSIONS: The reformed CDF is an improvement on its predecessor. However the 
main types of uncertainty seen in recent cancer appraisals will not readily be 
resolved solely by 2 years' RWD collection in the reformed CDF; where there are 
no ongoing trials to provide longer-term data, randomised trials rather than RWD 
may be needed to fully resolve questions of relative efficacy. Other types of 
uncertainty, and concerns with generalisability, may be more amenable to the RWD 
approach, and it is these that we expect to be the focus of data collection 
arrangements in the reformed CDF.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS) is effective but uptake is 
suboptimal.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of quality improvement (QI) 
interventions for DRS attendance; describe the interventions in terms of QI 
components and behaviour change techniques (BCTs); identify theoretical 
determinants of attendance; investigate coherence between BCTs identified in 
interventions and determinants of attendance; and determine the 
cost-effectiveness of QI components and BCTs for improving DRS.
DATA SOURCES AND REVIEW METHODS: Phase 1 - systematic review of randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions to increase DRS attendance 
(The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and trials registers to February 2017) 
and coding intervention content to classify QI components and BCTs. Phase 2 - 
review of studies reporting factors influencing attendance, coded to theoretical 
domains (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and sources of grey literature to March 
2016). Phase 3 - mapping BCTs (phase 1) to theoretical domains (phase 2) and an 
economic evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of BCTs or QI 
components.
RESULTS: Phase 1 - 7277 studies were screened, of which 66 RCTs were included in 
the review. Interventions were multifaceted and targeted patients, health-care 
professionals (HCPs) or health-care systems. Overall, interventions increased 
DRS attendance by 12% [risk difference (RD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.10 to 0.14] compared with usual care, with substantial heterogeneity in effect 
size. Both DRS-targeted and general QI interventions were effective, 
particularly when baseline attendance levels were low. All commonly used QI 
components and BCTs were associated with significant improvements, particularly 
in those with poor attendance. Higher effect estimates were observed in subgroup 
analyses for the BCTs of 'goal setting (outcome, i.e. consequences)' (RD 0.26, 
95% CI 0.16 to 0.36) and 'feedback on outcomes (consequences) of behaviour' (RD 
0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.29) in interventions targeting patients and of 
'restructuring the social environment' (RD 0.19, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.26) and 
'credible source' (RD 0.16, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.24) in interventions targeting 
HCPs. Phase 2 - 3457 studies were screened, of which 65 non-randomised studies 
were included in the review. The following theoretical domains were likely to 
influence attendance: 'environmental context and resources', 'social 
influences', 'knowledge', 'memory, attention and decision processes', 'beliefs 
about consequences' and 'emotions'. Phase 3 - mapping identified that 
interventions included BCTs targeting important barriers to/enablers of DRS 
attendance. However, BCTs targeting emotional factors around DRS were 
under-represented. QI components were unlikely to be cost-effective whereas BCTs 
with a high probability (≥ 0.975) of being cost-effective at a societal 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY included 'goal-setting 
(outcome)', 'feedback on outcomes of behaviour', 'social support' and 
'information about health consequences'. Cost-effectiveness increased when DRS 
attendance was lower and with longer screening intervals.
LIMITATIONS: Quality improvement/BCT coding was dependent on descriptions of 
intervention content in primary sources; methods for the identification of 
coherence of BCTs require improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Randomised controlled trial evidence indicates that QI 
interventions incorporating specific BCT components are associated with 
meaningful improvements in DRS attendance compared with usual care. 
Interventions generally used appropriate BCTs that target important barriers to 
screening attendance, with a high probability of being cost-effective. Research 
is needed to optimise BCTs or BCT combinations that seek to improve DRS 
attendance at an acceptable cost. BCTs targeting emotional factors represent a 
missed opportunity to improve attendance and should be tested in future studies.

Clinostomum spp. (Digenea: Clinostomidae) are a group of trematodes commonly 
found in the buccal cavity and oesophagus of a variety of piscivorous birds. The 
metacercariae, colloquially known as "yellow grubs," have been reported from a 
diverse group of freshwater fishes worldwide. In the catfish farming region of 
the southeastern USA, piscivorous birds present a continuous challenge for 
aquaculturists in the form of fish depredation and the introduction of 
trematodes into these static, earthen pond systems. Clinostomum spp. are 
commonly encountered in farm-raised catfish. While generally considered pests of 
minimal importance, heavy infections can result in unmarketable fillets. Of the 
piscivorous birds that frequent catfish aquaculture operations in the 
southeastern US, the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus Lesson) is 
one of the most damaging, although reports of Clinostomum spp. from P. auritus 
are limited. In this study, adult trematodes morphologically consistent with 
Clinostomum sp. were found in the trachea of a double-crested cormorant captured 
in Lowndes Co., Mississippi, USA. These specimens differed from other recognised 
Clinostomum spp. in several key morphological characters. Moreover, sequence 
data of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1), nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 gene (nad1) and ribosomal internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS) regions did not match any known Clinostomum sp. for 
which sequence data are available. While genetically similar to C. marginatum 
and C. album Rosser, Alberson, Woodyard, Cunningham, Pote & Griffin, 2017 
reported from the great egret Ardea alba L. in Mississippi, these adult 
clinostomids were larger in size and limited to the trachea, whereas both C. 
marginatum Rudolphi, 1819 and C. album are found in the oral cavity and 
esophagus. Given these distinct morphological and molecular characters we 
propose a new member of the genus, known hereafter as Clinostomum poteae n. sp. 
Additionally, larval stages in the life-cycle of C. album are morphologically 
and molecularly identified for the first time from ramshorn snails Planorbella 
trivolvis Say and fathead minnows Pimephales promelas Rafinesque.

The long-term benefit-to-risk ratio of sustained antipsychotic treatment for 
schizophrenia has recently been questioned. In this paper, we critically examine 
the literature on the long-term efficacy and effectiveness of this treatment. We 
also review the evidence on the undesired effects, the impact on physical 
morbidity and mortality, as well as the neurobiological correlates of chronic 
exposure to antipsychotics. Finally, we summarize factors that affect the 
risk-benefit ratio. There is consistent evidence supporting the efficacy of 
antipsychotics in the short term and mid term following stabilization of acute 
psychotic symptoms. There is insufficient evidence supporting the notion that 
this effect changes in the long term. Most, but not all, of the long-term cohort 
studies find a decrease in efficacy during chronic treatment with 
antipsychotics. However, these results are inconclusive, given the extensive 
risk of bias, including increasing non-adherence. On the other hand, long-term 
studies based on national registries, which have lower risk of bias, find an 
advantage in terms of effectiveness during sustained antipsychotic treatment. 
Sustained antipsychotic treatment has been also consistently associated with 
lower mortality in people with schizophrenia compared to no antipsychotic 
treatment. Nevertheless, chronic antipsychotic use is associated with metabolic 
disturbance and tardive dyskinesia. The latter is the clearest undesired 
clinical consequence of brain functioning as a potential result of chronic 
antipsychotic exposure, likely from dopaminergic hypersensitivity, without 
otherwise clear evidence of other irreversible neurobiological changes. 
Adjunctive psychosocial interventions seem critical for achieving recovery. 
However, overall, the current literature does not support the safe reduction of 
antipsychotic dosages by 50% or more in stabilized individuals receiving 
adjunctive psychosocial interventions. In conclusion, the critical appraisal of 
the literature indicates that, although chronic antipsychotic use can be 
associated with undesirable neurologic and metabolic side effects, the evidence 
supporting its long-term efficacy and effectiveness, including impact on life 
expectancy, outweighs the evidence against this practice, overall indicating a 
favorable benefit-to-risk ratio. However, the finding that a minority of 
individuals diagnosed initially with schizophrenia appear to be relapse free for 
long periods, despite absence of sustained antipsychotic treatment, calls for 
further research on patient-level predictors of positive outcomes in people with 
an initial psychotic presentation.

AIMS: Budesonide with multi-matrix technology (MMX) is an oral corticosteroid, 
shown to have high topical activity against ulcerative colitis (UC) while 
maintaining low systemic bioavailability with few adverse events. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of budesonide MMX versus 
commonly used corticosteroids, in the second-line treatment of active 
mild-to-moderate UC in the Netherlands.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An eight-state Markov model with an 8 week cycle length 
captured remission, four distinct therapy stages, hospitalization, possible 
colectomy and mortality. Remission probability for budesonide MMX was based on 
the CORE-II study. Population characteristics were derived from the Dutch 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease South Limburg cohort (n = 598) and included patients 
with proctitis (39%), left-sided (42%) and extensive disease (19%). Comparators 
(topical budesonide foam and enema, oral budesonide and prednisolone) were 
selected based on current Dutch clinical practice. Treatment effects were 
evaluated by network meta-analysis using a Bayesian framework. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over a 5 year time horizon from a 
societal perspective, with costs, health-state and adverse event utilities 
derived from published sources. Outcomes were weighted by disease extent 
distribution and corresponding comparators.
RESULTS: Budesonide MMX was associated with comparable quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gain versus foam and oral formulations (+0.01 QALYs) in the total UC 
population, whilst being cost-saving (EUR 366 per patient). Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis evaluated an 86.6% probability of budesonide MMX being 
dominant (cost-saving with QALY gain) versus these comparators. Exploratory 
analysis showed similar findings versus prednisolone.
LIMITATIONS: Differing definitions of trial end-points and remission across 
trials meant indirect comparison was not ideal. However, in the absence of 
head-to-head clinical data, these comparisons are reasonable alternatives and 
currently offer the only comparison of second-line UC treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present analysis, budesonide MMX was shown to be 
cost-effective versus comparators in the total UC population, for the 
second-line treatment of active mild-to-moderate UC in the Netherlands.

Physarum polycephalum, a single-celled, multinucleate slime mould, is a 
seemingly simple organism, yet it exhibits quasi-intelligent behaviour during 
extension, foraging, and as it adapts to dynamic environments. For these 
reasons, Physarum is an attractive target for modelling with the underlying goal 
to uncover the physiological mechanisms behind the exhibited quasi-intelligence 
and/or to devise novel algorithms for solving complex computational problems. 
The recent increase in modelling studies on Physarum has prompted us to review 
the latest developments in this field in the context of modelling and computing 
alike. Specifically, we cover models based on (i) morphology, (ii) taxis, and 
(iii) positive feedback dynamics found in top-down and bottom-up modelling 
techniques. We also survey the application of each of these core features of 
Physarum to solving difficult computational problems with real-world 
applications. Finally, we highlight some open problems in the field and present 
directions for future research.

OBJECTIVES: In Europe, there is uncertainty about the potential effects and 
cost-effectiveness of low dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer and 
about the applicability of results of North American studies. We aimed to 
estimate the effects and cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening in a 
population-based setting in Switzerland where the smoking prevalence is high.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MIcrosimulation Screening ANalysis-Lung (MISCAN) 
model was adapted using country specific input parameters regarding lung cancer 
epidemiology, smoking behaviours, and treatment costs. The effects and costs of 
648 screening scenarios with different screening start and stop ages, smoking 
eligibility criteria, and screening intervals were examined from a public 
healthcare system perspective across a lifetime horizon in a cohort born between 
1935 and 1965.
RESULTS: All screening scenarios showed an increase in the total number of 
detected lung cancer cases and a decrease in lung cancer mortality. On the 
efficiency frontier, 15 of 27 scenarios showed incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios below € 50,000 per life year gained. These scenarios reduced lung cancer 
mortality by 6-15% while increasing incidence of lung cancer diagnoses by 2-6%.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that lung cancer screening may be 
cost-effective in Switzerland, a high-income, European country with high smoking 
prevalence.

The ubiquitous and emerging physiology function of endogenous nitric oxide in 
vascular, myocardial, immune, and neuronal systems prompts chemists to develop a 
prodrug for the controlled delivery of ·NO in vivo and for the translational 
biomedical application. Inspired by the discovery of natural [Fe(NO)2] motif, 
herein, we develop the synthetic dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) 
[Fe2(μ-SR)2(NO)4] (1) as a universal platform for the O2-triggered release of 
·NO, for the regulation of ·NO-release kinetics (half-life = 0.6-27.4 h), and 
for the activation of physiological function of ·NO. Using C. elegans as a model 
organism, the ·NO-delivery DNIC 1 regulates IIS signaling pathway, AMPK 
signaling pathway, and mitochondrial function pathway to extend the lifespan and 
to delay the aging process based on the lifespan analysis, SA-βgal activity 
assay, and next-generation RNA sequencing analysis. This study unveils the 
anti-aging effect of ·NO and develops DNICs as a chemical biology probe for the 
continued discovery of unprecedented NO physiology.

INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment improves quality of life in patients with adult 
degenerative scoliosis (ADS). However, open ADS surgeries are complex, large 
magnitude operations associated with a high rate of complications. The lateral 
transpsoas interbody fusion technique is a less invasive alternative to open ADS 
surgery, but less invasive techniques tend to be more expensive. The objective 
of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the transpsoas technique 
for patients with ADS over a 12-month time horizon from a public payer 
perspective.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on a consecutive case 
series of patients who underwent ADS surgeries between 2006 and 2012. 
Effectiveness was expressed as the difference in patient reported preoperative 
and 12-month postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which was 
measured in quality-adjusted life years. Health-care resource use was tabulated 
based on a clinical chart review on an item-by-item basis. Unit cost data were 
obtained from published provincial costs in Alberta, Canada. All costs were 
adjusted to 2015 Canadian dollars. The base case analysis included costs for the 
surgery, initial hospitalization, and treatment for complications over a 
12-month follow-up period. The uncomplicated case analysis included costs for 
the surgery and initial hospitalization only. The joint uncertainty surrounding 
the cost and HRQOL differences was estimated using bootstrapping with 10,000 
replicates.
RESULTS: A total of 10 open technique and 12 transpsoas technique T11-pelvis 
fusions were included in the analysis. In the base case analysis, the transpsoas 
technique was less costly compared with the open technique, total cost of 
$83,513 (95% CI: $72,772-$94,253) versus $111,381 (95% CI: $36,340-$186,423), 
respectively (incremental cost $27,869), and was associated with 0.06 more 
quality-adjusted life years and/or patient. However, in the uncomplicated case, 
the open technique was less costly compared with the transpsoas technique 
($47,795 [95% CI: $39,003-$56,586] vs $76,510 [95% CI: $72,273-$80,746]), 
respectively, with an incremental cost of $28,715. Based on the probabilistic 
analysis of 10,000 bootstrap iterations for the base case analysis, the 
transpsoas technique was more effective and less costly compared with the open 
technique 57% of time. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis by adjusting 
bone-morphogenetic protein-2 dosage further improved cost effectiveness of the 
transpsoas technique by lowering overall costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Transpsoas surgeries were associated with better outcomes in terms 
of HRQOL and lower costs over 1-year follow-up period compared with more 
invasive open technique. This study should be viewed as a pilot evaluation and 
should be replicated in a larger prospective multicenter controlled study.

Peripheral vascular trauma due to injuries of the upper and lower limbs are 
life-threatening, and their treatment require rapid diagnosis and 
highly-qualified surgical procedures. Experienced surgeons have recognized that 
subclavian arteries, affected by injuries of the upper limbs, require a more 
careful handling due to fragility than common iliac arteries, which are may be 
affected by injures of the lower limbs. We investigated these two artery types 
with comparable diameter to evaluate the differences in the biomechanical 
properties between subclavian and iliac arteries. Human subclavian and common 
iliac arteries of 14 donors either from the right or the left side (age: 63 yrs, 
SD: 19,9 female and 5 male) were investigated. Extension-inflation-torsion 
experiments at different axial strains (0-20%), transmural pressures 
(0-200 mmHg) and torsion (±25°) on preconditioned arterial tubes were performed. 
Residual stresses in both circumferential and axial direction were determined. 
Additionally, the microstructure of the tissues was determined via 
second-harmonic generation imaging and by histological investigations. At 
physiological conditions (pi=13.3 kPa, λz=1.1) common iliac arteries revealed 
higher Cauchy stresses in circumferential and axial directions but a more 
compliant response in the circumferential direction than subclavian arteries. 
Both arteries showed distinct stiffer behavior in circumferential than in axial 
direction. Circumferential stiffness of common iliac arteries at physiological 
conditions increased significantly with aging (r=-0.67,p=0.02). The median 
inversion stretches, where the axial force is basically independent of the 
transmural pressure, were determined to be 1.05 for subclavian arteries and 1.11 
for common iliac arteries. Both arteries exhibited increased torsional 
stiffness, when either axial prestretch or inflation pressure was increased. 
Residual stresses in the circumferential direction were significantly lower for 
subclavian arteries than for common iliac arteries at measurements after 30 min 
(p=0.05) and 16hrs (p=0.01). Investigations of the collagen microstructure 
revealed different collagen fiber orientations and dispersions in subclavian and 
iliac arteries. The difference in the collagen microstructure revealed further 
that the adventitia seems to contribute significantly to the passive mechanical 
response of the tested arteries at physiological loadings. Histological 
investigations indicated pronounced thickened intimal layers in subclavian and 
common iliac arteries, with a thickness comparable to the adventitial layer. In 
conclusion, we obtained biomechanical differences between subclavian and common 
iliac arteries, which possibly resulted from their different mechanical 
loadings/environments and respective in vivo movements caused by their 
anatomical locations. The biomechanical differences explored in this study are 
well reflected by the microstructure of the collagen and the histology of the 
investigated arteries, and the results can improve trauma patient care and 
endovascular implant design.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: During surgical interventions surgeons experienced 
that subclavian arteries (SAs) supplying the upper extremities, appear more 
fragile and prone to damage during surgical repair than common iliac arteries 
(CIAs), supplying the lower extremities. To investigate this difference in a 
systematic way the aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties 
of these two arteries from the same donors in terms of geometry, 
extension-inflation-torsion behavior, residual stresses, microstructure, and 
histology. In regard to cardiovascular medicine the material behavior of aged 
human arteries is of crucial interest. Moreover, the investigation of SA is 
important as it can help to improve surgical procedures at this challenging 
location. Over the long-term it might well be of value in the construction of 
artificial arteries for substituting native arteries. In addition, the analysis 
of mechanical stresses can improve design and material choice for endovascular
