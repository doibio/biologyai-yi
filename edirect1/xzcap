The aim of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
combining intraductal RFA with biliary metal stent placement for patients with 
malignant biliary obstruction.
METHODS: Patients who received percutaneous intraductal RFA and biliary stent 
placement for malignant biliary obstruction between 2013 and 2015 were 
identified. Outcomes were stent patency, technique and clinical success rate, 
overall survival (OS) and complication rates. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression 
analyses were used to examine the association of various factors with stent 
patency and OS. Complications and laboratory abnormalities were recorded.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were treated with percutaneous RFA and stent placement. 
The rates of technical success and clinical success were 98% and 92%, 
respectively. The median stent patency was 7.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
5.3, 8.7) months and OS was 5.0 (95% CI: 4.0, 6.0) months. On univariable 
analysis, previously cholangitis was an independent poor prognosis factor for 
recurrent biliary obstruction. OS was improved in patients who received more 
than one intervention compared to those who received only one intervention 
(log-rank P = 0.007), and in those treated without versus those treated with 
sequential chemotherapy (log-rank P = 0.017). On multivariable analysis, the 
occurrence of more than one intervention (P = 0.019) had independent prognostic 
significance for OS.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous RFA and stent placement is a technically safe and 
feasible therapeutic option for the palliative treatment of malignant biliary 
obstruction. The long-term efficacy and safety of the procedure is promising, 
but further study is required via randomized and prospective trials.

Infectious disease burdens vary from country to country and year to year due to 
ecological and economic drivers. Recently, Murray et al. (Murray CJ et al 2012 
Lancet380, 2197-2223. (doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4)) estimated 
country-level morbidity and mortality associated with a variety of factors, 
including infectious diseases, for the years 1990 and 2010. Unlike other 
databases that report disease prevalence or count outbreaks per country, Murray 
et al. report health impacts in per-person disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), allowing comparison across diseases with lethal and sublethal health 
effects. We investigated the spatial and temporal relationships between DALYs 
lost to infectious disease and potential demographic, economic, environmental 
and biotic drivers, for the 60 intermediate-sized countries where data were 
available and comparable. Most drivers had unique associations with each 
disease. For example, temperature was positively associated with some diseases 
and negatively associated with others, perhaps due to differences in disease 
agent thermal optima, transmission modes and host species identities. Biodiverse 
countries tended to have high disease burdens, consistent with the expectation 
that high diversity of potential hosts should support high disease transmission. 
Contrary to the dilution effect hypothesis, increases in biodiversity over time 
were not correlated with improvements in human health, and increases in 
forestation over time were actually associated with increased disease burden. 
Urbanization and wealth were associated with lower burdens for many diseases, a 
pattern that could arise from increased access to sanitation and healthcare in 
cities and increased investment in healthcare. The importance of urbanization 
and wealth helps to explain why most infectious diseases have become less 
burdensome over the past three decades, and points to possible levers for 
further progress in improving global public health.This article is part of the 
themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific 
evidence and policy implications'.

Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland, United States.

OBJECTIVES: Differences in the availability of a Social Security Number (SSN) by 
race/ethnicity could affect the ability to link with death certificate data in 
passive follow-up studies and possibly bias mortality disparities reported with 
linked data. Using 1989-2009 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data linked 
with the National Death Index (NDI) through 2011, we compared the availability 
of a SSN by race/ethnicity, estimated the percent of links likely missed due to 
lack of SSNs, and assessed if these estimated missed links affect race/ethnicity 
disparities reported in the NHIS-linked mortality data.
METHODS: We used preventive fraction methods based on race/ethnicity-specific 
Cox proportional hazards models of the relationship between availability of SSN 
and mortality based on observed links, adjusted for survey year, sex, age, 
respondent-rated health, education, and US nativity.
RESULTS: Availability of a SSN and observed percent linked were significantly 
lower for Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander (PI) participants compared with 
White non-Hispanic participants. We estimated that more than 18% of expected 
links were missed due to lack of SSNs among Hispanic and Asian/PI participants 
compared with about 10% among White non-Hispanic participants. However, 
correcting the observed links for expected missed links appeared to only have a 
modest impact on mortality disparities by race/ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Researchers conducting analyses of mortality disparities using the 
NDI or other linked death records, need to be cognizant of the potential for 
differential linkage to contribute to their results.

Pediatric overweight and obesity is an emerging public health priority as rates 
have rapidly increased worldwide. Obesity is often clustered with other 
metabolic abnormalities including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin 
resistance, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This cluster of 
risk factors, termed the metabolic syndrome, has traditionally been reported in 
adults. However, with the increased prevalence of pediatric obesity, the 
metabolic syndrome is now evident in children and adolescents. This complex 
cluster of risk factors is the result of the pathological interplay between 
several organs including adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and intestine with a 
common antecedent - insulin resistance. The association of the metabolic 
syndrome with several systemic alterations that involve numerous organs and 
tissues adds to the complexity and challenge of diagnosing the metabolic 
syndrome and identifying useful clinical indicators of the disease. The complex 
physiology of growing and developing children and adolescents further adds to 
the difficulties in standardizing laboratory assessment, diagnosis, and 
prognosis for the diverse pediatric population. However, establishing a 
consensus definition is critical to identifying and managing children and 
adolescents at high risk of developing the metabolic syndrome. As a result, the 
examination of novel metabolic syndrome biomarkers which can detect these 
metabolic abnormalities early with high specificity and sensitivity in the 
pediatric population has been of interest. Understanding this complex cluster of 
risk factors in the pediatric population is critical to ensure that this is not 
the first generation where children have a shorter life expectancy than their 
parents. This review will discuss the pathophysiology, consensus definitions and 
laboratory assessment of pediatric metabolic syndrome as well as potential novel 
biomarkers.

Psychiatry Residents' Perceptions and Reported Practices in Providing Primary 
Care.

Wehr LM, Vanderlip ER, Gibbons PH, Fiedorowicz JG.

BACKGROUND: Patients with psychiatric disorders have higher rates of chronic 
medical conditions and decreased life expectancy. Integrating medical and 
psychiatric care is likely to improve health outcomes for these patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined what proportion of psychiatry residents viewed 
psychiatry as a primary care specialty, how important they felt it was to 
provide primary care to patients, and how this perception altered self-reported 
comfort and practice patterns in providing screening and treatment for select 
general medical conditions.
METHODS: An online survey was sent to current psychiatry residents of US 
residency programs.
RESULTS: A total of 268 residents from 40 programs completed the survey (25% 
response rate), with 55% (147 of 265) of respondents considering psychiatry to 
be a primary care specialty. Residents who held this opinion gave higher ratings 
for the importance of providing preventive counseling and reported counseling a 
higher percentage of patients on a variety of topics. They also reported 
screening more patients for several medical conditions. Residents who considered 
psychiatry to be primary care did not report greater comfort with treating these 
conditions, with the exception of dyslipidemia. The most commonly cited barrier 
to integrating primary care services was lack of time.
CONCLUSIONS: Residents' perceptions of psychiatry as a primary care field 
appears to be associated with a higher reported likelihood of counseling about, 
and screening for, medical conditions in their patients.

BACKGROUND: Insulin is generally administered to people with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM) using multiple daily injections (MDIs), but can also be 
delivered using infusion pumps. In the UK, pumps are recommended for patients 
with the greatest need and adult use is less than in comparable countries. 
Previous trials have been small, of short duration and have failed to control 
for training in insulin adjustment.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pump 
therapy compared with MDI for adults with T1DM, with both groups receiving 
equivalent structured training in flexible insulin therapy.
DESIGN: Pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group cluster randomised 
controlled trial, including economic and psychosocial evaluations. After 
participants were assigned a group training course, courses were randomly 
allocated in pairs to either pump or MDI.
SETTING: Eight secondary care diabetes centres in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with T1DM for > 12 months, willing to undertake intensive 
insulin therapy, with no preference for pump or MDI, or a clinical indication 
for pumps.
INTERVENTIONS: Pump or MDI structured training in flexible insulin therapy, 
followed up for 2 years. MDI participants used insulin analogues. Pump 
participants used a Medtronic Paradigm® VeoTM (Medtronic, Watford, UK) with 
insulin aspart (NovoRapid, Novo Nordisk, Gatwick, UK).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome - change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
at 2 years in participants whose baseline HbA1c was ≥ 7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Key 
secondary outcome - proportion of participants with HbA1c ≤ 7.5% at 2 years. 
Other outcomes at 6, 12 and 24 months - moderate and severe hypoglycaemia; 
insulin dose; body weight; proteinuria; diabetic ketoacidosis; quality of life 
(QoL); fear of hypoglycaemia; treatment satisfaction; emotional well-being; 
qualitative interviews with participants and staff (2 weeks), and participants 
(6 months); and ICERs in trial and modelled estimates of cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: We randomised 46 courses comprising 317 participants: 267 attended a 
Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating course (132 pump; 135 MDI); 260 were included 
in the intention-to-treat analysis, of which 235 (119 pump; 116 MDI) had 
baseline HbA1c of ≥ 7.5%. HbA1c and severe hypoglycaemia improved in both 
groups. The drop in HbA1c% at 2 years was 0.85 on pump and 0.42 on MDI. The mean 
difference (MD) in HbA1c change at 2 years, at which the baseline HbA1c was 
≥ 7.5%, was -0.24% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53% to 0.05%] in favour of 
the pump (p = 0.098). The per-protocol analysis showed a MD in change of -0.36% 
(95% CI -0.64% to -0.07%) favouring pumps (p = 0.015). Pumps were not 
cost-effective in the base case and all of the sensitivity analyses. The pump 
group had greater improvement in diabetes-specific QoL diet restrictions, daily 
hassle plus treatment satisfaction, statistically significant at 12 and 24 
months and supported by qualitative interviews.
LIMITATION: Blinding of pump therapy was not possible, although an objective 
primary outcome was used.
CONCLUSION: Adding pump therapy to structured training in flexible insulin 
therapy did not significantly enhance glycaemic control or psychosocial outcomes 
in adults with T1DM.
RESEARCH PRIORITY: To understand why few patients achieve a HbA1c of < 7.5%, 
particularly as glycaemic control is worse in the UK than in other European 
countries.

Werner Syndrome (WS) is a rare, adult‑onset progeroid syndrome that is 
associated with multiple age‑associated complications and relatively short life 
expectancy. The characteristics of WS include a 'bird‑like' appearance, 
canities, cataracts and ulcerations around the ankles. In addition, certain 
patients develop hypogonadism with atrophic genitalia and infertility. The 
average life span of affected individuals is 54 years. Previous studies have 
demonstrated that mutations in the Werner syndrome RecQ like helicase gene (WRN) 
may contribute to WS. The present study investigated a consanguineous family 
with WS, comprising of 4 generations from Northwest China (Gansu province). A 
novel homozygous splice‑site mutation in WRN (c.IVS28+2T>C) was identified in 
this family and was predicted to be deleterious. No further relevant mutations 
were identified by direct sequencing of the genes lamin A/C, barrier to 
autointegration factor 1, zinc metallopeptidase STE24 and DNA polymerase Δ1. 
cDNA sequencing and alignments were performed to further confirm the 
pathogenicity of this mutation. The results support the important role of WRN in 
WS and expand the spectrum of known WRN mutations. In addition, it may provide 
novel approaches in genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with WS.

Using the Payoff Time in Decision-Analytic Models: A Case Study for Using 
Statins in Primary Prevention.

BACKGROUND: The payoff time represents an estimate of when the benefits of an 
intervention outweigh the costs. It is particularly useful for benefit-harm 
decision making for interventions that have deferred benefits but upfront harms. 
The aim of this study was to expand the application of the payoff time and 
provide an example of its use within a decision-analytic model.
METHODS: Three clinically relevant patient vignettes based on varying levels of 
estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk (10%, 15%, 20%) were developed. An 
existing state-transition Markov model taking a health service perspective and a 
life-time horizon was adapted to include 3 levels of direct treatment disutility 
(DTD) associated with ongoing statin use: 0.005, 0.01, and 0.015. For each 
vignette and DTD we calculated a range of outputs including the payoff time 
inclusive and exclusive of healthcare costs.
RESULTS: For a 10% 10-year cardiovascular risk (vignette 1) with low-levels of 
DTD (0.005), the payoff time was 8.5 years when costs were excluded and 16 years 
when costs were included. As the baseline risk of cardiovascular increased, the 
payoff time shortened. For a 15% cardiovascular risk (vignette 2) and for a 
low-level of DTD, the payoff time was 5.5 years and 9.5 years, respectively. For 
a 20% cardiovascular risk (vignette 3), the payoff time was 4.2 and 7.2 years, 
respectively. For higher levels of DTDs for each vignette, the payoff time 
lengthened, and in some instances the intervention never paid off, leading to an 
expected net harm for patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown how the payoff time can be readily applied to 
an existing decision-analytic model and be used to complement existing measures 
to guide healthcare decision making.

New role of mechanical assist device as bridge to transplant: USA perspective.

Mohamed A(1), Mehta N, Eisen HJ.

Author information:

Pennsylvania, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiac transplant remains the gold standard of care for 
patients with end-stage heart failure. Unfortunately, due to the limited 
availability of donor hearts in the United States, not all eligible candidates 
are able to be transplanted. Since the introduction of mechanical assist devices 
for the treatment of advanced heart failure, patients gain a significant 
survival benefit while awaiting transplant. With rapidly evolving technology, it 
is important to appreciate the advances in the current use of mechanical assist 
devices.
RECENT FINDINGS: Following a comprehensive analysis of novel therapies in 
end-stage heart failure, there is an enhancement in quality of life and life 
expectancy following implantation of left ventricular (LV) assist devices 
(LVADs). When implanted in suitable patients as bridge-to-transplant or 
'destination therapy', recipients demonstrate superior outcomes and survival 
compared with those who remain on optimal medical therapy.
SUMMARY: The use of LV assist devices (LVADs) as bridge to transplantation has 
gained popularity over the last decade. It is recognized as an integral 
treatment modality in end-stage heart failure to those awaiting heart 
transplantation. When implanted in the appropriately chosen patient, it is 
superior to medical treatment alone and has shown noninferiority to heart 
transplantation while allowing for optimal functional status and preservation of 
end organ function.

Designing Fit for Purpose Health and Social Services for Ageing Populations.

Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.

Population ageing is occurring in all countries, regardless of the level of 
economic development. While the rising burden of chronic diseases and 
disabilities as a consequence of this demographic transition is well recognized, 
the increasing prevalence of geriatric syndromes as a public health issue is not 
as well recognized. Recently the World Health Organization's World Health and 
Ageing Report emphasized functional ability as an important outcome for aging 
populations, highlighting the concept of raising intrinsic capacity throughout 
the life course. The complementary perspective is the prevention of frailty, 
which has physical, cognitive, social and psychological dimensions. Therefore, 
services for older people should encompass medical as well as social components. 
The need and evolution for a transition in health and social services in Hong 
Kong, a special administrative region of China which has a population with the 
world's highest life expectancy, is presented as an example of how one developed 
economy attempts to meet the challenges of population ageing. There is a need to 
shift to integrated care in the community instead of specialty dominated 
hospital care, and to establish regular activities in the community to adopt and 
maintain a lifestyle that reduces frailty and disability (or promotes intrinsic 
capacity). A top down approach with financial incentives, together with public 
education to help drive policy changes, are key drivers of change. It is 
expected that there will be much heterogeneity between different countries in 
terms of barriers and facilitators, such that each country needs to document 
their needs and design appropriate services.

New Metrics for Economic Evaluation in the Presence of Heterogeneity: Focusing 
on Evaluating Policy Alternatives Rather than Treatment Alternatives.

Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA (DDK).

and the Departments of Health Services and Economics University of Washington, 
Seattle, WA, USA (AB).

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) methods fail to acknowledge that 
where cost-effectiveness differs across subgroups, there may be differential 
adoption of technology. Also, current CEA methods are not amenable to 
incorporating the impact of policy alternatives that potentially influence the 
adoption behavior. Unless CEA methods are extended to allow for a comparison of 
policies rather than simply treatments, their usefulness to decision makers may 
be limited.
METHODS: We conceptualize new metrics, which estimate the realized value of 
technology from policy alternatives, through introducing subgroup-specific 
adoption parameters into existing metrics, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) and Incremental Net Monetary Benefits (NMBs). We also provide the Loss 
with respect to Efficient Diffusion (LED) metrics, which link with existing 
value of information metrics but take a policy evaluation perspective. We 
illustrate these metrics using policies on treatment with combination therapy 
with a statin plus a fibrate v. statin monotherapy for patients with diabetes 
and mixed dyslipidemia.
RESULTS: Under the traditional approach, the population-level ICER of 
combination v. monotherapy was $46,000/QALY. However, after accounting for 
differential rates of adoption of the combination therapy (7.2% among males and 
4.3% among females), the modified ICER was $41,733/QALY, due to the higher rate 
of adoption in the more cost-effective subgroup (male). The LED metrics showed 
that an education program to increase the uptake of combination therapy among 
males would provide the largest economic returns due to the significant 
underutilization of the combination therapy among males under the current 
policy.
CONCLUSION: This framework may have the potential to improve the decision-making 
process by producing metrics that are better aligned with the specific policy 
decisions under consideration for a specific technology.

Inspired from geldanamycin, the synthesis of a new series of 20-membered 
macrocyclic compounds is developed. The key features in our design are (i) 
retention of the fragment having the precise chiral functional groups of 
geldanamycin at C10, C11, C12 and C14, and (ii) replacement of an olefin moiety 
with the ester group, and the quinoid sub-structure with the triazole ring. The 
southern fragment needed for the macrocyclic ring formation was obtained from 
Evans' syn aldol as the key reaction and with the use of D-mannitol as the cheap 
source of a chiral starting material. For the synthesis of the northern 
fragment, we utilized l-ascorbic acid, which provided the desired chiral 
functional groups at C6 and C7. Further, the chain extension completed the 
synthesis of the northern fragment. In our approach, the crucial 20 membered 
macrocyclic ring was formed employing the click chemistry. When tested for their 
ability to directly trans-differentiate human mesenchymal stem cells to neurons, 
two novel compounds (20a and 7) from this series were identified and this was 
further validated by the presence of specific neuronal biomarkers (i.e. nestin, 
agrin and RTN4).

There is a lack of studies on the impact of very toxic and persistent organic 
compounds as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the population life expectancy. Preliminary 
studies on the relations between exposure to PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in ambient air 
and the length of life of residents of 12 cities (2 million people) in the 
Silesia province has been undertaken. The average length of life of inhabitants 
in 12 cities of Silesia province was calculated on the basis of register of 
deaths after excluding deaths caused by external causes and the concentration of 
PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were measured. The studies have shown that inhalation 
exposure to dioxins, furans and dl-PCBs could be an important factor which may 
shorten the life expectancy of the population. The results of preliminary 
studies indicate a strong correlation between the concentration of PCDD/Fs and 
dl-PCBs in the ambient air and the length of life of women. The conducted 
analysis of the regression shows that reduction of chlorinated persistent 
organic compounds of 10fg I-TEQ/m3 could extend life expectancy of women by 
approximately 4months (0.3years).

Email: mrmadhan@kisr.edu.kw

Objective: To explore salient trends in incidence and mortality from breast 
cancer among Kuwaiti females and to quantify the number of years that could be 
saved if breast cancer deaths were eliminated. Methods: Appling life table 
technique, the paper constructs a bridged, multiple decrement and 
cancer-elimination life tables for Kuwaiti females. Data sources include Kuwait 
Cancer Control Center Registry along with vital statistics on mortality by age 
groups, nationality, and causes of death according to ICD-10 revision. Result: 
The study finds that, without interventions, nearly 2.5% of Kuwaiti female live 
births are expected to die from breast cancer. By contrast, if this disease were 
to be completely eradicated, Kuwaiti females are expected to gain half a year of 
life expectancy at birth. Likewise, a 10% reduction in deaths attributed to 
breast cancer would produce a gain of 11 days of life at age 30. The gain would 
augment to 51 days when death is reduced by 50%. Kuwaiti females aged 50 would 
add almost 5 months when breast cancer is eradicated, while a 20 percent 
reduction in breast cancer mortality would raise their life expectancy by 26 
days. Conclusion: The results strongly support policy interventions of Kuwait’s 
government by instituting a well-documented public health policy for chronic 
diseases and mitigating the increase of cancer prevalence.

Morquio A syndrome is an ultra-rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorder 
associated with progressive, multi-systemic clinical impairments, causing 
gradual loss of functional capacity and endurance, impaired quality of life, and 
early mortality. Studies in Morquio A patients have used the 6-min walk test 
(6MWT) to assess functionality and endurance and to evaluate disease progression 
or efficacy of treatment. The objective of the present study was to review 
minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for the 6MWT reported for 
disease states that widely use the 6MWT to evaluate clinical benefit and to 
discuss the results in view of the challenges in estimating MCID for ultra-rare 
diseases, using the case of elosulfase alfa in Morquio A patients. A systematic 
literature search was performed using Embase and Medline to identify studies 
specifically estimating the MCID using either anchor-based or distribution-based 
methods. A total of 19 publications on 17 studies were identified; none of these 
included patients with Morquio A syndrome or the wider disease category of 
lysosomal storage disorders. Therefore, the MCIDs determined by studies in 
patients with respiratory, cardiovascular, or musculoskeletal disease were 
compared to changes in the 6MWT seen in Morquio A patients in the pivotal phase 
3 clinical trial of elosulfase alfa enzyme replacement therapy. The literature 
review showed a mean MCID for the 6MWT of 7% change (range 3-15%) in studies 
using anchor-based methods and a 9% change (range 4-16%) using 
distribution-based methods. Results of the elosulfase alfa clinical trial and 
its extension showed a placebo-adjusted 14.9% improvement in the 6MWT from 
baseline at week 24, which was greater than the mean MCID based on the results 
of the systematic literature review. After 2 years, 6MWT distance increased by a 
mean of 20.7% from baseline in a modified per-protocol population, versus a 
reduction of 6.9% in comparable untreated patients from the MorCAP natural 
history study over the same period. Although further research is required to 
establish the MCID of the 6MWT in Morquio A patients, the presented data provide 
further evidence for the positive effect of elosulfase alfa in this patient 
population.

Cloning procedures often interfere with conceptus growth and life ex utero, in a 
set of symptoms known as abnormal offspring syndrome (AOS). The aim of the 
present study was to compare the developmental pattern of in vivo-derived (IVD), 
IVF-derived and handmade cloning-derived (NT-HMC) Day 225 bovine concepti using 
established procedures. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed on Day 30 following 
blastocyst transfer on Day 7. Conceptus morphometry was assessed by 
ultrasonography on Day 51, and on Day 225 pregnant cows were killed for 
morphological examination of concepti. Pregnancy outcome was similar between 
groups, with greater pregnancy losses in the first trimester (70.6%) and smaller 
fetuses on Day 51 in the NT-HMC group than in the IVD (14.3%) and IVF (20.0%) 
groups. However, NT-HMC-derived concepti were twofold larger on Day 225 of 
gestation than controls. A higher frequency (63.5%) of placentomes larger than 
the largest in the IVD group was observed in the NT-HMC group, which may be 
relevant to placental function. Conceptus traits in the IVF group were similar 
to the IVD controls, with only slight changes in placentome types. Morphological 
changes in cloned concepti likely affected placental function and metabolism, 
disrupting the placental constraining mechanism on fetal growth in mid- to late 
pregnancy.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of underwater ultrasound (US) therapy in 
48 patients with moderately active rheumatoid arthritis (disease activity score 
in 28 joints [DAS28]>3.2 and<5.1).
METHODS: Patients randomly assigned to the ultrasound group (n=25) received 
underwater continuous ultrasound therapy to both wrists and hands for 7min per 
session with an intensity of 0.7W/cm2 for 10 sessions. The control group (n=23) 
received sham treatment under the same conditions. At baseline, at the end of 
treatment (end of Week 2) and at the follow-up visit (Week 14), the following 
outcomes were evaluated: disease activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], 
C-reactive protein [CRP], tender and swollen joint counts, pain on a visual 
analog scale, DAS28, hand function (fist making, wrist extension and flexion, 
hand grip strength) and quality of life (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]).
RESULTS: A significant decrease in C-reactive protein at the end of Week 2 and 
Week 14 compared to control group (mean between-group difference at 2 
weeks=-5.77, 95% CI=-10.86 to -0.68, mean between-group difference at 14 
weeks=-5.07, 95% CI=-10.13 to -0.01), and non-significant decrease in DAS28 was 
observed. By the end of treatments at the end of week 2, ultrasound alleviated 
pain significantly (mean between-group difference at two weeks=-8.35 95% 
CI=-16.12 to -0.58), as well as improved left wrist extension compared to the 
control group (mean between-group difference at 14 weeks=4.35, 95% 
CI=1.09-7.60).
CONCLUSION: Underwater ultrasound therapy was better than sham treatment at the 
end of 2 weeks of treatment, but not at long term (14 weeks) in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis.

We evaluated the direct effects of three different atmospheric CO2 
concentrations (380 ppm, 550 ppm and 750 ppm) on the population parameters of 
the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera fed an artificial diet. The life 
history and fitness of H. armigera were analyzed using an age-stage, two-sex 
life table. Our results showed significantly longer larval durations and lower 
female pupal weight under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2. Additionally, the 
fecundity of H. armigera was lower under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2. H. 
armigera reared under elevated CO2 conditions showed lower intrinsic and finite 
rates of increase but higher net consumption and finite consumption rates than 
H. armigera reared under ambient CO2 conditions. According to population 
projections, a much smaller total population size and reduced consumption 
capacities would be expected in an elevated CO2 atmosphere due to higher 
mortality and lower growth rate compared with ambient CO2 levels. These results 
indicate that the fitness of and potential damage caused by H. armigera would be 
affected by increased CO2 relative to ambient CO2 concentrations. Additional 
studies on the long-term direct and indirect effects of elevated CO2 levels on 
H. armigera are still needed.

BACKGROUND: The causes of death have changed with regard to the epidemiological 
and demographic events in society. There is no evidence of prior research into 
the epidemiological transition in Turkey. This transition in Turkey should be 
observed starting with the Ottoman Empire period (19th to early 20th century). 
However, information about the Ottoman Empire is quite limited.
AIMS: To discuss the epidemiological and demographic transitions in Turkey, 
using demographic, educational and urbanization data in our present study.
STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive archive study.
METHODS: Mortality statistics dating from 1931 and published by the Turkish 
Statistical Institute were analysed, and the causes of death were coded and 
classified according to ICD-10. Other data were obtained from the published 
reports and studies regarding the issue.
RESULTS: In the 1930s, Turkey's life expectancy was low (aged 40 years), 
fertility and mortality rates were high (respectively 45% and 31%), and the main 
causes of death were infectious diseases. Nowadays, life expectancy is close to 
80 years, the total fertility rate has dropped to 2.1 per woman, and the main 
causes of death are chronic diseases and cancer. The population rate in the 
urban areas has increased steadily from 24.2% in 1927 to 77.3% in 2012. level of 
education has also increased during this period. In 1935, less than 10% of women 
were literate, and in 2013 90% were literate. Qualitative and quantitative 
increase have been observed in the presentation and access of healthcare 
services compared to the early years of the Republic.
CONCLUSION: Turkey has been undergoing a modernization period in the last 200 
years, and it is believed that the epidemiological and demographic transitions 
result from this period. This process has led to urbanization and an increase in 
the level of education, as well as a decrease in premature deaths, lower 
fertility rates, and an increase in the elderly population and chronic diseases. 
It is therefore our conclusion that Turkey needs policies regarding the elderly 
population and the management of chronic diseases.

[Twenty years of combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection in the 
Netherlands: progression and new challenges].

Due to the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) 20 years 
ago, HIV infection in the Netherlands has changed from a fatal disease to a 
chronic condition with a near normalized life expectancy. The average age of 
HIV-positive patients continues to increase, as does the prevalence of 
non-HIV-related comorbidity. The number of new HIV diagnoses seems to be 
decreasing in the Netherlands, which is partly due to increased testing, earlier 
diagnosis, prompt cART initiation, and achievement of high levels of viral 
suppression, resulting in a reduced likelihood of onward transmission. In order 
to further curb the epidemic, it is important that as yet undiagnosed people 
living with HIV are identified as soon as possible. All practicing physicians in 
the Netherlands can contribute to this goal.
