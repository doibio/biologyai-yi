BACKGROUND: People in prison experience a range of physical and mental health 
problems. Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of prison-based 
interventions presents a number of methodological challenges. We present a case 
study of an economic evaluation of a prison-based intervention ("Engager") to 
address common mental health problems.
METHODS: Two hundred and eighty people were recruited from prisons in England 
and randomised to Engager plus usual care or usual care. Participants were 
followed up for 12 months following release from prison. The primary analysis is 
the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of Engager compared to 
usual care from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective with QALYs 
calculated using the CORE 6 Dimension. A cost-consequences analysis evaluated 
cross-sectoral costs and a range of outcomes.
RESULTS: From an NHS perspective, Engager cost an additional £2737 per 
participant (95% of iterations between £1029 and £4718) with a mean QALY 
difference of - 0.014 (95% of iterations between - 0.045 and 0.017). For the 
cost-consequences, there was evidence of improved access to substance misuse 
services 12 months post-release (odds ratio 2.244, 95% confidence Interval 
1.304-3.861).
CONCLUSION: Engager provides a rare example of a cost-utility analysis conducted 
in prisons and the community using patient-completed measures. Although the 
results from this trial show no evidence that Engager is cost-effective, the 
results of the cost-consequences analysis suggest that follow-up beyond 
12 months post-release using routine data may provide additional insights into 
the effectiveness of the intervention and the importance of including a wide 
range of costs and outcomes in prison-based economic evaluations.

South Africa has the world's largest antiretroviral programme which has resulted 
in an increase in life expectancy in persons living with HIV. Parkinson's 
disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder. No data has been 
published in this setting with regards to the interaction between PD and people 
infected with HIV. This was a retrospective study which matched two HIV 
non-infected PD patients to one HIV-infected patient with PD. Patients with 
secondary causes of Parkinsonism were excluded. Demographic, clinical and 
laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Hoehn and Yahr scale was used to 
assess PD severity. Twenty PD patients were recruited from 1 January 2008 to 31 
October 2020 and were diagnosed with HIV for a median of 72 months. The median 
age at onset of PD was 52 years. All patients were on antiretroviral therapy. 
There were no statistically significant differences in the levodopa equivalent 
daily dose, clinical phenotype, impulse control disorders (ICDs) and frequency 
of a positive family history between the two groups. HIV-infected patients had a 
higher frequency of dopamine dysregulation syndrome. At the end of follow-up, 3 
(15%) PLH-PD had moderate to severe PD compared to 16 (40%) of PD controls. The 
OR of having moderate to severe PD in HIV non-infected PD patients was 4. 
Persons living with HIV and Parkinson's disease present with PD symptoms at a 
younger age, progress slower to a severe stage and respond well to dopaminergic 
replacement therapy.

The continuous improvement of life expectancy of patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has resulted in increased risk of second primary 
malignancy that potentially may affect survival and quality of life of CLL 
patients. We performed a systematic review to assess the risk and the 
clinical-pathological features and prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell 
carcinoma (cSCC) in patients with CLL. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane 
Central Register of Control Trials databases for articles published from 
database inception to December 31, 2019. English-language studies reporting 
original data on patients with a specific diagnosis of CLL and cSCC were 
included. Data were extracted using a standardized extraction form, and any 
discordance was resolved by consensus. Descriptive data were generated by 
pooling patients from eligible studies. Of the 4588 non-duplicate records 
identified, 55 articles met our inclusion criteria. These studies reported that 
CLL patients have a 3.2% prevalence of cSCC, with an 11.5% cSCC-related 
lethality and an overall risk of metastasis of 5.7% (7.3% for regional lymph 
node involvement and 3.8% for distant metastasis). The quality of evidence was 
limited by the high heterogeneity in the design, populations, and objectives of 
the included studies. This systematic review suggests that cSCC in CLL patients 
tends to behave less aggressively compared with the solid organ transplant 
recipients but has a higher morbidity and mortality than in the general 
population. Future prospective studies are needed to increase the quality of 
evidence and to determine the best treatment modalities and screening intervals 
for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has focused on the mortality associated with armed 
conflict as the primary measure of the population health effects of war. 
However, mortality only demonstrates part of the burden placed on a population 
by conflict. Injuries and resultant disabilities also have long-term effects on 
a population and are not accounted for in estimates that focus solely on 
mortality. Our aim was to demonstrate a new method to describe the effects of 
both lives lost, and years of disability generated by a given conflict, with 
data from the US-led 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our data come from interviews conducted in 2014 in 900 
Baghdad households containing 5,148 persons. The average household size was 5.72 
persons. The majority of the population (55.8%) were between the ages of 19 and 
60. Household composition was evenly divided between males and females. 
Household sample collection was based on methodology previously designed for 
surveying households in war zones. Survey questions were answered by the head of 
household or senior adult present. The questions included year the injury 
occurred, the mechanism of injury, the body parts injured, whether injury 
resulted in disability and, if so, the length of disability. We present this 
modeling study to offer an innovative methodology for measuring "years lived 
with disability" (YLDs) and "years of life lost" (YLLs) attributable to 
conflict-related intentional injuries, using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
approach. YLDs were calculated with disability weights, and YLLs were calculated 
by comparing the age at death to the GBD standard life table to calculate 
remaining life expectancy. Calculations were also performed using Iraq-specific 
life expectancy for comparison. We calculated a burden of injury of 5.6 million 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to conflict-related injuries in 
Baghdad from 2003 to 2014. The majority of DALYs lost were attributable to YLLs, 
rather than YLDs, 4.99 million YLLs lost (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 3.87 
million to 6.13 million) versus 616,000 YLDs lost (95% UI 399,000 to 894,000). 
Cause-based analysis demonstrated that more DALYs were lost to due to gunshot 
wounds (57%) than any other cause. Our study has several limitations. Recall 
bias regarding the reporting and attribution of injuries is possible. Second, we 
have no data past the time of the interview, so we assumed individuals with 
ongoing disability at the end of data collection would not recover, possibly 
counting more disability for injuries occurring later. Additionally, incomplete 
data could have led to misclassification of deaths, resulting in an 
underestimation of the total burden of injury.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we propose a methodology to perform burden of 
disease calculations for conflict-related injuries (expressed in DALYs) in 
Baghdad from 2003 to 2014. We go beyond previous reports of simple mortality to 
assess long-term population health effects of conflict-related intentional 
injuries. Ongoing disability is, in cross section, a relatively small 10% of the 
total burden. Yet, this small proportion creates years of demands on the health 
system, persistent limitations in earning capacity, and continuing burdens of 
care provision on family members.

BACKGROUND: Access to health services across the continuum of care improves 
maternal and newborn health outcomes. Ethiopia launched the Community-Based 
Newborn Care programme in 2013 to increase the coverage of antenatal care, 
institutional delivery, postnatal care and newborn care. The programme also 
introduced gentamicin and amoxicillin treatment by health extension workers for 
young infants with possible serious bacterial infection when referral was not 
possible. This study aimed to assess the extent to which the coverage of health 
services for mothers and their young infants increased after the initiation of 
the programme.
METHODS: A baseline survey was conducted in October-December 2013 and a 
follow-up survey four years later in November-December 2017. At baseline, 10,224 
households and 1,016 women who had a live birth in the 3-15 months prior to the 
survey were included. In the follow-up survey, 10,270 households and 1,057 women 
with a recent live birth were included. Women were asked about their experience 
of care during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum periods, as well as the 
treatment provided for their child's illness in the first 59 days of life.
RESULTS: Between baseline and follow-up surveys the proportion of women 
reporting at least one antenatal care visit increased by 15 percentage points 
(95% CI: 10,19), four or more antenatal care visits increased by 17 percentage 
points (95%CI: 13,22), and institutional delivery increased by 40 percentage 
points (95% CI: 35,44). In contrast, the proportion of newborns with a postnatal 
care visit within 48 hours of birth decreased by 6 percentage points (95% CI: 
-10, -3) for home deliveries and by 14 percentage points (95% CI: -21, -7) for 
facility deliveries. The proportion of mothers reporting that their young infant 
with possible serious bacterial infection received amoxicillin for seven days 
increased by 50 percentage points (95% CI: 37,62) and gentamicin for seven days 
increased by 15 percentage points (95% CI: 5,25). Concurrent use of both 
antibiotics increased by 12 percentage points (95% CI: 4,19).
CONCLUSION: The Community-Based Newborn Care programme was an ambitious 
initiative to enhance the access to services for pregnant women and newborns. 
Major improvements were seen for the number of antenatal care visits and 
institutional delivery, while postnatal care remained alarmingly low. Antibiotic 
treatment for young infants with possible serious bacterial infection increased, 
although most treatment did not follow national guidelines. Improving postnatal 
care coverage and using a simplified antibiotic regimen following recent World 
Health Organization guidelines could address gaps in the care provided for sick 
young infants.

OBJECTIVES: Robust economic evaluations are needed to identify efficient 
strategies for lung cancer prevention that combine brief and intensive smoking 
cessation intervention programmes with screening using low-dose computed 
tomography (LDCT) at different ages, frequencies, and coverages. We aimed to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation approaches combined with lung 
cancer screening in the European context at a population level from a societal 
perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model that describes the natural 
history of lung cancer and incorporates several prevention strategies was 
developed. Discounted lifetime QALYs and costs at a rate of 3% were used to 
calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, defined as additional costs in 
2017 Euros per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Smoking cessation interventions reduce the incidence of lung cancer by 
8%-46% and are consistently more effective and cost-effective when starting at 
younger ages. Screening reduces lung cancer mortality by 1%-24% and is generally 
less effective and more costly than smoking cessation interventions. The most 
cost-effective strategy would be to implement intensive smoking cessation 
interventions at ages 35, 40 and 45, combined with screening every three years 
between the ages of 55 and 65.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining smoking cessation interventions with LDCT screening is a 
very attractive prevention strategy that substantially diminishes the burden of 
lung cancer. These combined prevention strategies, especially when providing 
several intensive interventions for smoking cessation at early ages, are more 
cost-effective than both approaches separately and allow for a more intensified 
LDCT without losing efficiency.

Management of Cardiovascular Risk in Perimenopausal Women with Diabetes.

Kim C(1).

Author information:
(1)Departments of Medicine, Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Epidemiology, 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of mortality in women and men with 
diabetes. Due to age and worsening of risk factors over the menopausal 
transition, risk of coronary heart disease events increases in postmenopausal 
women with diabetes. Randomized studies have conflicted regarding the beneficial 
impact of estrogen therapy upon intermediate cardiovascular disease markers and 
events. Therefore, estrogen therapy is not currently recommended for indications 
other than symptom management. However, for women at low risk of adverse events, 
estrogen therapy can be used to minimize menopausal symptoms. The risk of 
adverse events can be estimated using risk engines for the calculation of 
cardiovascular risk and breast cancer risk in conjunction with screening tools 
such as mammography. Use of estrogen therapy, statins, and anti-platelet agents 
can be guided by such calculators particularly for younger women with diabetes. 
Risk management remains focused upon lifestyle behaviors and achieving optimal 
levels of cardiovascular risk factors, including lipids, glucose, and blood 
pressure. Use of pharmacologic therapies to address these risk factors, 
particularly specific hypoglycemic agents, may provide some additional benefit 
for risk prevention. The minimal benefit for women with limited life expectancy 
and risk of complications with intensive therapy should also be considered.

Corrigendum to: Multimorbidity through the lens of life-limiting illness: how 
helpful are Australian clinical practice guidelines to its management in primary 
care?

Damarell RA, Morgan DD, Tieman JJ, Healey DF.

This study assessed Australian clinical practice guidelines for life-limiting 
index conditions for the extent to which they acknowledged comorbidities and 
framed management recommendations within the context of older age and reduced 
life expectancy. A comprehensive search identified current, evidence-based 
Australian guidelines for chronic life-limiting conditions directed at general 
practitioners. Guideline content was analysed qualitatively before comorbidity 
acknowledgements were quantified using a 17-item checklist. Full guidelines were 
quality appraised using AGREE-II. Ten documents covering chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, heart failure, cancer pain, dementia and palliative care in 
aged care were identified. Most guidelines addressed one 'comorbid' condition 
and prompted clinicians to consider patient quality of life and personal 
preferences. Fewer addressed burden of treatment and half suggested modifying 
treatments to account for limited life expectancy, age or time horizon to 
benefit. Half warned of potential adverse drug interactions. Guidelines were of 
moderate to very high quality. Guidelines naturally prioritised their index 
condition, directing attention to only the most common comorbidities. However, 
there may be scope to include more condition-agnostic guidance on multimorbidity 
management. This might be modelled on the 'guiding principles' approach now 
emerging internationally from organisations such as the American Geriatrics 
Society in response to increasing multimorbidity prevalence and evidence 
limitations.

Editorial Commentary: More Clinical Trials Should Focus on Primary Prevention of 
Osteoarthritis: Disruptive Thinkers Are Required.

Hohmann E.

Comment on
    Arthroscopy. 2021 Aug;37(8):2627-2639.

With increasing life expectancy and an increased prevalence of osteoarthritis, 
the total number of individuals with symptomatic degenerative arthritis will 
most likely increase considerably. The current focus of nonoperative treatment 
is on weight loss, exercise, muscle strengthening, physical therapy, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular injection therapies with 
corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, or platelet-rich plasma, and lately, 
disease-modifying drugs. Obviously, prevention is better than cure, but only 5% 
of all studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov in the United States are 
intending to develop strategies for prevention. The overall majority of included 
studies (89%) will target symptom resolution, and 6% will investigate 
disease-modifying drugs.

OBJECTIVES: A healthy diet is associated with reduced risk for premature death; 
however, data on the association between food expenditure and life expectancy 
are scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the association of 
expenditure on food groups with life expectancy in men and women.
METHODS: This study used data from 1548 counties, representing >90% of the 
population of the United States from 2001 through the end of 2014. Multivariable 
adjusted Bayesian generalized linear models were used to assess the association 
of county-level expenditure on nine groups of individual food and combined 
healthy and unhealthy foods, and a constructed healthy diet score with life 
expectancy at 40 y of age by sex.
RESULTS: A 1-unit increase in the healthy diet score based on food expenditure 
was associated with a 0.07 y (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.10), 0.04 y 
(95% CI, 0.02-0.07), and 0.06 y (95% CI, 0.04-0.08) increase in county-level 
life expectancy among men alone, women alone, and men and women combined, 
respectively. Increasing expenditure on whole grains (estimate of per 1% 
increase 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03-0.11), fresh fruit and vegetables (0.06; 95% CI, 
0.02-0.09), and dairy products (0.05; 95% CI, 0.03-0.07), as well as reducing 
expenditure on sugar-sweetened beverages (-0.02; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.01) and 
processed red meat (-0.05; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.02) showed a positive association 
with increased county-level life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may inform a nutritional measure against premature 
death and stagnation of increase in life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: To analyse the transitions of disability onset and recovery, 
estimate life expectancy (LE) with and without disability and explore the 
relation between insurance and disability patterns in the population aged 50+ in 
Mexico.
DESIGN: Multistate life table analysis of data from a longitudinal cohort 
survey.
SETTING: Data came from the Mexican Health and Aging Study, a longitudinal and 
representative survey of older adults in Mexico.
PARTICIPANTS: 10 651 individuals aged 50+ interviewed in 2012 and 2015, 
including those who died between waves.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability is measured using the 
activities of daily living (ADL) scale. Transition rates between disability 
free, ADL disabled and death were employed to estimate total life expectancy 
(TLE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE).
RESULTS: 46% of the individuals who reported an ADL limitation in 2012 recover 
from disability by 2015. TLE at age 60 for people without ADL limitations is 30 
years (95% CI 28.9 to 31), out of which 4.7 years (95% CI 4.1 to 5.4) are lived 
with ADL limitations, while TLE at age 60 in the initially disabled is 18.7 
years (95% CI 17.3 to 20), with 9.4 years (95% CI 8.4 to 10.3) lived with 
disability. DFLE at age 60 in people with social security is 24.2 years (95% CI 
23.3 to 25.2), in people with public insurance is 24.6 years (95% CI 23.7 to 
25.4) and in uninsured people is 26.9 years (95% CI 25.9 to 27.9).
CONCLUSIONS: In Mexico, a substantial proportion of ADL disabled individuals 
recover from disability. Nevertheless, initially disabled individuals have a 
considerably lower DFLE regardless of age when compared with initially active 
individuals. There appeared to be no differences in terms of disability and LEs 
between the individuals with social security and public insurance.

Mutations in the LaminA gene are a common cause of monogenic dilated 
cardiomyopathy. Here we show that mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific Lmna 
deletion develop cardiac failure and die within 3-4 weeks after inducing the 
mutation. When the same Lmna mutations are induced in mice genetically deficient 
in the LINC complex protein SUN1, life is extended to more than one year. 
Disruption of SUN1's function is also accomplished by transducing and expressing 
a dominant-negative SUN1 miniprotein in Lmna deficient cardiomyocytes, using the 
cardiotrophic Adeno Associated Viral Vector 9. The SUN1 miniprotein disrupts 
binding between the endogenous LINC complex SUN and KASH domains, displacing the 
cardiomyocyte KASH complexes from the nuclear periphery, resulting in at least a 
fivefold extension in lifespan. Cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the SUN1 
miniprotein prevents cardiomyopathy progression, potentially avoiding the 
necessity of developing a specific therapeutic tailored to treating each 
different LMNA cardiomyopathy-inducing mutation of which there are more than 
450.

We evaluated the stabilities of kojibiose and sophorose when heated under 
neutral pH conditions. Kojibiose and sophorose epimerized at the C-2 position of 
glucose on the reducing end, resulting in the production of 
2-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose and 2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose, 
respectively. Under weak alkaline conditions, kojibiose was decomposed due to 
heating into its mono-dehydrated derivatives, including 3-deoxy-2,3-unsaturated 
compounds and bicyclic 3,6-anhydro compounds. Following these experiments, we 
propose a kinetic model for the epimerization and decomposition of kojibiose and 
sophorose by heat treatment under neutral pH and alkaline conditions. The 
proposed model shows a good fit with the experimental data collected in this 
study. The rate constants of a reversible epimerization of kojibiose at pH 7.5 
and 90 °C were (1.6 ± 0.1) × 10-5 s-1 and (3.2 ± 0.2) × 10-5 s-1 for the forward 
and reverse reactions, respectively, and were almost identical to those [(1.5 ± 
0.1) × 10-5 s-1 and (3.5 ± 0.4) × 10-5 s-1] of sophorose. The rate constant of 
the decomposition reaction for kojibiose was (4.7 ± 1.1) × 10-7 s-1 whereas that 
for sophorose [(3.7 ± 0.2) × 10-6 s-1] was about ten times higher. The 
epimerization reaction was not significantly affected by the variation in the 
buffer except for a borate buffer, and depended instead upon the pH value 
(concentration of hydroxide ions), indicating that epimerization occurred as a 
function of the hydroxide ion. These instabilities are an extension of the 
neutral pH conditions for keto-enol tautomerization that are often observed 
under strong alkaline conditions.

Background: Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) is a rare 
paraneoplastic intraocular syndrome that causes progressive visual loss in 
patients, and is associated with an underlying malignancy. Recently, the 
incidence of BDUMP has increased with the prolonged life expectancy of oncology 
patients. Case Presentation: We report a case of a 68-year-old man with 
significant visual loss in both eyes. The patient presented with a diffusely 
thickened choroid and ciliary body, extremely shallow anterior chamber, 
increased intraocular pressure, and cataract formation, accompanied by exudative 
retinal detachment in both eyes. He underwent a pars plana vitrectomy and 
choroidal biopsy, which revealed benign proliferation of melanocytes. A small 
amount of subretinal fluid persisted, and uveal thickness persisted in the early 
postoperative period. During the 1-year follow-up assessment, he underwent 
rectal tumor resection, and was pathologically diagnosed with rectal 
adenocarcinoma. Six months after the rectal tumor resection, the subretinal 
fluid was completely absorbed and the retina had reattached. The thickness of 
both the ciliary body and choroid had significantly decreased. Conclusion: This 
case report describes a rare paraneoplastic intraocular syndrome, BDUMP, which 
was associated with rectal adenocarcinoma. Treatment for the primary malignancy 
gradually improved the visual symptoms and signs.

Active coating could improve the fish quality and extend the shelf life. This 
study investigates the effect of locust bean gum (LBG) and sodium alginate (SA) 
active coatings containing lemon verbena (Lippa citriodora Kunth.) essential oil 
(LVEO) emulsions on microbiological, physicochemical and organoleptic evaluation 
of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) samples during refrigerated 
storage at 4°C. Results showed that LBG-SA coatings incorporated with 0.30 or 
0.60% LVEO emulsions significantly inhibited the growth of mesophile bacteria, 
Pseudomonas spp., H2S-producing bacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and 
psychrophilic bacteria, and reduce the productions of trimethylamine (TMA), 
total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and ATP-related compounds. Further, the 
LVEO treatments also retarded the water migration and maintained the 
organoleptic evaluation results of large yellow croaker during storage at 4°C. 
In conclusion, the LBG-SA active coatings incorporated with LVEO emulsions 
maintained the quality and extended the shelf life of large yellow croaker 
during refrigerated storage.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis associated with 
polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) experience deterioration in health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) as the disease progresses. Findings from the randomized 
placebo-controlled phase III NEURO-TTR study showed treatment benefit of 
inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, for preserving or improving HRQOL after 
65 weeks of treatment. The current analysis examines longitudinal trends in 
specific aspects of HRQOL, including polyneuropathy symptoms, daily activities, 
and physical, role, and social functioning in patients with ATTRv-PN receiving 
long-term treatment in a follow-up open-label extension (OLE) study.
METHODS: One-hundred thirty-five patients with ATTRv-PN were enrolled in an 
ongoing 5-year OLE study following completion of NEURO-TTR. Eighty-five patients 
received continuous weekly treatment with inotersen in both studies 
(inotersen-inotersen group), while 50 patients switched from placebo to 
inotersen at OLE study baseline (placebo-inotersen group). Descriptive analyses 
of changes in domain scores and item responses through week 104 of the OLE study 
were conducted for measures of neuropathy-related and generic HRQOL: Norfolk 
QOL-Diabetic Neuropathy (DN) questionnaire and SF-36v2® Health Survey (SF-36v2), 
respectively.
RESULTS: For both inotersen-inotersen and placebo-inotersen groups, all Norfolk 
QOL-DN and most SF-36v2 domain scores remained stable from OLE baseline through 
week 104. Differences in HRQOL between the two groups at OLE baseline were 
sustained through week 104. Analysis of item responses from NEURO-TTR baseline 
to OLE study week 104 (170 weeks) for the inotersen-inotersen group found no 
notable increases in the proportion of patients reporting substantial 
impairments across a wide variety of symptoms, daily activities, and 
functioning.
CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with inotersen preserved HRQOL for patients with 
ATTRv-PN for periods of up to 3 years. The gap in HRQOL between those who had 
previously received inotersen or placebo in NEURO-TTR did not close by week 104 
of the OLE phase, indicating the importance of early treatment for maintaining 
HRQOL in these patients.

Plain Language Summary: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy 
is a rare disease that causes damage to nerves in the limbs, leading to pain, 
numbness, loss of sensitivity, and muscle weakness, with eventual loss of the 
ability to walk (i.e., patients require a wheelchair or are bedridden). As the 
disease progresses, patients’ quality of life, including their ability to engage 
in everyday activities, socialize with others, work, and live independently, 
continually worsens. In a recent clinical trial (the NEURO-TTR study), patients 
with this disease randomized to receive the drug inotersen for 66 weeks 
maintained their quality of life, while patients randomized to receive a placebo 
showed continued worsening. All patients completing the NEURO-TTR study could 
participate in an extension study during which all patients knowingly received 
inotersen for up to 5 years. We examined quality of life in patients through the 
first 2 years of this extension study. For all patients, regardless of previous 
treatment (inotersen or placebo), most aspects of quality of life did not change 
throughout the 2-year extension study, showing that inotersen can preserve 
quality of life of these patients for up to 2–3 years. However, while quality of 
life in patients who had received placebo in the NEURO-TTR study did not get 
worse during the extension study, it also did not improve to match that of 
patients who received inotersen during the NEURO-TTR study. This finding shows 
the importance of treating these patients with inotersen as early as possible to 
preserve their quality of life before it substantially deteriorates.

Cold plasma (CP) is an upcoming technology implemented for the preservation of 
highly perishable foods, especially aquatic food products (AFPs). The high 
moisture content, high-quality protein with all essential amino acids and 
unsaturated fatty acids makes AFP more susceptible to microbial spoilage and 
oxidation of lipids and proteins. Spoilage lowers the nutritive value and could 
generate toxic components, making it unsafe for consumption. In recent times, 
the rising demand for food products of aquatic origin with preserved quality and 
extended shelf-life has been recorded. In addition, minimally or nonthermally 
processed and preserved foods are gaining great attention. CP technology has 
demonstrated an excellent ability to inactivate microorganisms without promoting 
their resistance and triggering some deteriorative enzymes, which are typical 
factors responsible for the spoilage of AFP. Consequently, CP could be 
recommended as a minimal processing intervention for preserving the quality of 
AFP. This review focuses on different mechanisms of fish spoilage, that is, by 
microorganisms and oxidation, their inhibition via the application of CP, and 
the retention of quality and shelf-life extension of AFP.

The increase in human life expectancy has become a challenge to reduce the 
deleterious consequences of aging. Nowadays, an increasing number of the 
population suffer from age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These disorders present 
different signs of neurodegeneration such as mitochondrial dysfunction, 
inflammation, and oxidative stress. Accumulative evidence suggests that the 
transcriptional factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) plays 
a vital defensive role orchestrating the antioxidant response in the brain. Nrf2 
activation promotes the expression of several antioxidant enzymes that exert 
cytoprotective effects against oxidative damage and mitochondrial impairment. In 
this context, several studies have proposed a role of Nrf2 in the pathogenesis 
of PD and AD. Thus, we consider it important to summarize the ongoing literature 
related to the effects of the Nrf2 pathway in the context of these diseases. 
Therefore, in this review, we discuss the mechanisms involved in Nrf2 activity 
and its connection with mitochondria, energy supply, and antioxidant response in 
the brain. Furthermore, we will lead our discussion to identify the 
participation of the Nrf2 pathway in mitochondrial impairment and 
neurodegeneration present in PD and AD. Finally, we will discuss the therapeutic 
effects that the Nrf2 pathway activation could have on the cognitive impairment, 
neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial failure present in PD and AD.

The discovery and application of antibiotics in the common clinical practice has 
undeniably been one of the major medical advances in our times. Their use meant 
a drastic drop in infectious diseases-related mortality and contributed to 
prolonging human life expectancy worldwide. Nevertheless, antibiotics are 
considered by many a double-edged sword. Their extensive use in the past few 
years has given rise to a global problem: antibiotic resistance. This factor and 
the increasing evidence that a wide range of antibiotics can damage mammalian 
mitochondria, have driven a significant sector of the medical and scientific 
communities to advise against the use of antibiotics for purposes other to 
treating severe infections. Notwithstanding, a notorious number of recent 
studies support the use of these drugs to treat very diverse conditions, ranging 
from cancer to neurodegenerative or mitochondrial diseases. In this context, 
there is great controversy on whether the risks associated to antibiotics 
outweigh their promising beneficial features. The aim of this review is to 
provide insight in the topic, purpose for which the most relevant findings 
regarding antibiotic therapies have been discussed.
