Radiation therapy (RT) is the main type of antitumor treatment in inoperable 
patients. Low awareness and fear of the development of radiation reactions 
contributes to the destabilization of psycho-emotional state of patients, which 
can result in withdrawal from treatment and deterioration of their quality of 
life (QOL). Despite a steady increase in cancer rates in Ukraine, there are 
currently no studies to develop measures to improve psychological condition of 
patients undergoing treatment in radiation therapy departments.
OBJECTIVE: to assess the dynamics of psycho-emotional status and QOL of cancer 
patients at the stage of radiation therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved psychodiagnostic examination of 66 
cancer patients who underwent radiation treatment in the clinic of the State 
Organization «Grigoriev Institute for Medical Radiology and Oncology of the NAMS 
of Ukraine», of whom Group 1 included 44 patients with head and neck cancer, 
Group 2 comprised 22 patients with colorectal cancer. Comparison group comprised 
30 conditionally «healthy» respondents without cancer. All patients had stage 
III-IV cancer. The study implied the employment of «Distress Thermometer», 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the SF-36 Questionnaire (Short 
Form). The examination was performed before and following the course of 
radiation therapy. Group 1 patients underwent only psychodiagnostic examination, 
Group 2 patients apart from psychodiagnostic were accompanied by a psychologist 
before undergoing radiation procedures. In the comparison group, the survey was 
conducted once.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Assessment of the data showed that before the start of 
RT most subjects (72.73 % in Group 1 and 77.3 % in Group 2) had a high level of 
distress, they were worried and nervous before the first radiation procedure, 
had fears about the consequences and side effects. The level of anxiety in Group 
1 at the pathological and subclinical level was recorded in 54.55 % of patients, 
the rate of depression at the subclinical level was diagnosed in 18.20 %, and in 
9.10 % of patients at the clinical one. In Group 2, the level of anxiety that 
exceeded the norm was recorded significantly less often (27.25 % vs. 54.55 %, pt 
< 0.05), and the rate of depression at the subclinical level was diagnosed 
significantly more often than in Group 1 (54.50 % vs. 18.20 %, pt < 0.05), and 
in 18.2 % of patients at the clinical level. After radiation, 81.81 % of Group 1 
patients showed an increase in distress and anxiety, and depressive symptoms 
tended to worsen. The level of distress in Group 2 after consulting a 
psychologist in preparation for RT and undergoing radiation procedures decreased 
almost twice, the level of anxiety decreased to normal, the indicators of 
depressive symptoms remained unchanged. According to QOL assessments on the 
scales of physical and role functioning (PF and RP), general health (GH) and 
mental health (MH), patients in both groups had significantly lower scores 
before the RT than in the comparison groups. After the procedures, there was a 
significant deterioration in the RP scale in Group 1 (18.75 vs. 40.00, pt < 
0.05), and an improvement of almost 2 times in Group 2 (35.73 vs. 68.33, pt < 
0.06). The indicator of general health (GH) at the end of RT in Group 1 did not 
change, and in Group 2 it tended to improve (20.93 vs. 47.26, pt < 0.06). Life 
expectancy (LE) in Group 1 tended to decrease further after treatment, having 
increased 1.7 times in Group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that cancer patients before the onset of RT 
experienced a rather strong distress and level of anxiety. Psychological 
correction of the emotional state at the beginning of treatment allowed for a 
significant improvement in the QOL of patients on the scales of role physical 
functioning (RF) and vitality (VT). An important area of work of a clinical 
psychologist at this stage of treatment involved correction of cognitive sphere, 
support of role functioning and formation of behavior aimed at further 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: The criteria for the selection of COVID-19 patients that could 
benefit most from ECMO organ support are yet to be defined. In this study, we 
evaluated the predictive performance of ECMO mortality predictive models in 
patients with COVID-19. We also performed a cost-benefit analysis depending on 
the mortality predicted probability. We conducted a retrospective cohort study 
in COVID-19 patients who received ECMO at two tertiary care hospitals between 
March 2020 to July 2021.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the discrimination (C-statistic), 
calibration (Cox calibration), and accuracy of the prediction of death due to 
severe ARDS in V-V ECMO score (PRESERVE), the Respiratory Extracorporeal 
Membrane Oxygenation Survival Score (RESP) score, and the PREdiction of Survival 
on ECMO Therapy-Score (PRESET) score. In addition, we compared the RESP score 
with Plateau pressure instead of Peak pressure.
RESULTS: We included a total of 36 patients, 29 (80%) of them male and with a 
median (IQR) APACHE of 10 (8-15). The PRESET score had the highest 
discrimination (AUROCs 0.81 [95%CI 0.67-0.94]) and calibration 
(calibration-in-the-large 0.5 [95%CI -1.4 to 0.3]; calibration slope 2.2 [95%CI 
0.7/3.7]). The RESP score with Plateau pressure had higher discrimination than 
the conventional RESP score. The cost per QALY in the USA, adjusted to life 
expectancy, was higher than USD 100 000 in patients older than 45 years with a 
PRESET > 10.
CONCLUSION: The PRESET score had the highest predictive performance and could 
help in the selection of patients that benefit most from this resource-demanding 
and highly invasive organ support.

Life-Expectancy: A Retrospective Study.

BACKGROUND: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has become an established 
treatment for cuff arthropathy, severe osteoarthritis and in certain fracture 
cases. Due to the increasingly aging population, patients who have already 
exceeded their life-expectancy pose a significant challenge to the shoulder 
surgeon.
METHODS: Patients older than 83 years who received a RTSA were included. 
Elective cases were compared to fracture cases. Patient demographics, hospital 
stay length, complication rate, functional outcome, patient reported outcome 
scores and mortality were assessed retrospectively.
RESULTS: We included 110 cases, 48 in the elective group and 62 in the fracture 
group. The average age at time of surgery was 86.6 ± 3.5 years. Mean follow-up 
was 30 months. Elective cases had a significant shorter hospital stay length (P 
= .014). Functional outcome scores showed better results for the elective group 
with ASES 79 ± 12 vs 69 ± 19 (P = .07), QuickDASH 29 ± 16 vs 37 ± 21 (P = .22), 
subjective shoulder value 86 ± 14 vs 75 ± 19 (P = .04*) and VAS .7 ± 1.5 vs 2.1 
± 2.5 (P = .02*). There was no significant difference in ROM and mean 
quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) with 3.2 ± 1.8 vs 3.5 ± 2.5 years (P = .69). 
The complication rate requiring surgical intervention was 2.4% in the elective 
and 6.5% in the fracture group. The 1-year mortality was 3 (6%) respectively 9 
(15%).
CONCLUSION: RTSA in elderly patients can be successful with good functional 
outcomes. Age should not be a contraindication. Instead, the patient's activity 
level and quality of life should be taken into account. Elective RTSA show 
better functional outcome scores and lower complication rates compared to RTSA 
in proximal humeral fractures.

Circular permutation (CP) is a protein sequence rearrangement in which the 
amino- and carboxyl-termini of a protein can be created in different positions 
along the imaginary circularized sequence. Circularly permutated proteins 
usually exhibit conserved three-dimensional structures and functions. By 
comparing the structures of circular permutants (CPMs), protein research and 
bioengineering applications can be approached in ways that are difficult to 
achieve by traditional mutagenesis. Most current CP detection algorithms depend 
on structural information. Because there is a vast number of proteins with 
unknown structures, many CP pairs may remain unidentified. An efficient 
sequence-based CP detector will help identify more CP pairs and advance many 
protein studies. For instance, some hypothetical proteins may have CPMs with 
known functions and structures that are informative for functional annotation, 
but existing structure-based CP search methods cannot be applied when those 
hypothetical proteins lack structural information. Despite the considerable 
potential for applications, sequence-based CP search methods have not been well 
developed. We present a sequence-based method, SeqCP, which analyzes normal and 
duplicated sequence alignments to identify CPMs and determine candidate CP sites 
for proteins. SeqCP was trained by data obtained from the Circular Permutation 
Database and tested with nonredundant datasets from the Protein Data Bank. It 
shows high reliability in CP identification and achieves an AUC of 0.9. SeqCP 
has been implemented into a web server available at: 
http://pcnas.life.nthu.edu.tw/SeqCP/.

BACKGROUND: As the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment landscape 
continues to evolve, the prolonged life expectancy and long-term exposure to 
antiretroviral drugs have modified the burden associated with living with HIV.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand the current treatment and comorbidity burden in 
people living with HIV (PLWH).
METHODS: Peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews (SLRs) between 2017 and 
2020 that included US studies and examined drug adherence/pill burden, 
resistance burden, or comorbidities in PLWH were identified. Methods and 
findings were extracted for the overall studies and examined in the subset of US 
studies.
RESULTS: Among 665 publications identified, 47 met the inclusion criteria (drug 
adherence/pill burden: 5; resistance: 3; comorbidities: 40). While 
antiretroviral drug adherence levels varied across SLRs, single-tablet regimens 
(STR) were associated with higher adherence versus multiple-tablet regimens. 
STRs were also associated with lower risk of treatment discontinuation, higher 
cost-effectiveness, and lower risk of hospitalization. Longer survival resulted 
in a high comorbidity burden, with non-AIDS causes accounting for 47% of deaths 
among PLWH in the US. HIV doubled the risk of cardiovascular disease and was 
associated with other health problems, including bone and muscle diseases, 
depression, and cancers. Several antiretroviral regimens were associated with 
chronic diseases, including cardiometabolic conditions. Lifetime HIV costs are 
substantially increasing, driven by antiretroviral, adverse event, and 
comorbidity treatment costs cumulated due to longer survival times.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable burden associated with HIV and 
antiretroviral treatment, highlighting the benefits of less complex and safer 
regimens, and the unmet need for effective preventative interventions.

Study 2019.

Globally, the number of people living with diabetes mellitus (DM) increased by 
62% between 1990 and 2019, affecting 463 million people in 2019, and is 
projected to increase further by 51% by 2045. The increasing burden of DM that 
requires chronic care could have a considerable cost implication in the health 
system, particularly in resource constraint settings like Nepal. In this 
context, this study attempts to present the burden of DM in terms of prevalence, 
mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The study is based on the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, a multinational collaborative research, led 
by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations. In the study, the overall 
prevalence of DM was estimated using DisMod MR-2.1, a Bayesian metaregression 
model. DALYs were estimated summing years of life lost due to premature death 
and years lived with disability. There were a total of 1,412,180 prevalent cases 
of DM, 3,474 deaths and 189,727 DALYs, due to DM in 2019. All-age prevalence 
rate and the age-standardized prevalence rate of DM stood at 4,642.83 (95% 
uncertainty interval (UI): 4,178.58-5,137.74) and 5,735.58 (95% UI: 
5,168.74-6327.73) cases per 100,000 population, respectively, in 2019. In 2019, 
1.8% (95% UI: 1.54, 2.07) of total deaths were from DM, which is a more than 
three-fold increase from the proportion of deaths attributed in 1990 (0.43%, 95% 
UI: 0.36, 0.5) with most of these deaths being from DM type 2. In 2019, a total 
of 189,727 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to DM of 
which 105,950 DALYs were among males, and the remaining 83,777 DALYs were among 
females. Overall, between 1990 and 2019, the DALYs, attributable to Type 1 and 2 
DM combined and for Type 2 DM only, have increased gradually across both sexes. 
However, the DALYs per 100,000 attributable to DM have slightly reduced across 
both sexes in that time. There is a high burden of DM in Nepal in 2019 with a 
steep increase in the proportion of deaths attributable to DM in Nepal which 
could pose a serious challenge to the health system. Primary prevention of DM 
requires collaborative efforts from multiple sectors. Meanwhile, the current 
federal structure could be an opportunity for integrated, locally tailored 
public health and clinical interventions for the prevention of the disease and 
its consequences.

Acquired cardiovascular diseases account for much of the increased risk of 
premature death in patients with Turner syndrome (TS). Hypertension is a major 
modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. It has a high prevalence in TS developing 
at an early age and thus leading to prolonged exposure to high blood pressure. 
The aetiology for hypertension in TS is largely unknown. It is likely 
multifactorial, and recent hypotheses include altered sympathetic tone, 
vasculopathy and endocrine factors. In this review article we aim to provide a 
comprehensive review of data on mechanisms of hypertension in TS and their 
implication for diagnostics and optimal choice of antihypertensive treatments. 
Ultimately this knowledge should help prevent hypertension-related 
complications, and improve quality of life and life expectancy for patients with 
TS.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer mortality in women has declined statistically 
significantly over the past several years. In men, it is unclear whether 
survival has changed over time. We evaluated changes in breast cancer-specific 
survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) in male breast cancer over the past 3 
decades.
METHODS: We evaluated men diagnosed with breast cancer between 1988 and 2017, 
reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Patients 
were categorized into 3 groups by year of diagnosis: 1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 
2008-2017. BCSS and OS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier, and differences between 
groups were compared by log-rank test. Multivariable Cox regression evaluated 
the independent association of year of diagnosis with BCSS and OS. All tests 
were 2-sided.
RESULTS: We included 8481 men. Overall, BCSS at 5 years was 83.69%, 83.78%, and 
84.41% in groups 1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2017, respectively (P = .86). 
There was no statistically significant difference in BCSS between the 3 groups 
within each stage of disease. Among all patients, OS at 5 years was 64.61%, 
67.31%, and 69.05% in groups 1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2017, respectively 
(P = .01). In adjusted Cox models, each additional year of diagnosis had no 
statistically significant association with BCSS (hazard ratio = 1.00, 95% 
confidence interval = 0.99 to 1.01, P = .75), but there was statistically 
significant improvement in OS (hazard ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98 to 0.99, 
P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 3 decades, there has been no statistically 
significant improvement in BCSS in male breast cancer. Changes in OS over time 
are consistent with increasing life expectancy. Efforts to improve BCSS in male 
breast cancer are warranted.

BACKGROUND: The use of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with other 
anti-cancer agents was a priority for treating advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) patients with considerable PD-L1 expression. However, studies 
seldom show the progression of liver metastases after using immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs).
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care 
of Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Military Medical 
University. In the present study, we analyzed five non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients who had liver metastases after they were treated with 
pembrolizumab between 2019 and 2021. All of them had both stable primary lesions 
and liver progression with pembrolizumab intervention. Blood laboratory tests 
and imaging examinations were performed regularly during the treatment to assess 
the tumor responses of patients.
RESULTS: All patients displayed reduction or stability in the initial lesions as 
a result, but they also experienced the emergence of metastatic liver locations, 
which were regularly detected throughout immunotherapy. Additionally, the 
appearance of liver metastasis weakened their liver function gradually with the 
escalation of carcinoembryonic antigen, regarded as a predictor for evaluating 
the progression of tumors. These individuals were highly distinctive with 
hyper-progressive diseases associated with immunotherapy. We drew individualized 
intervention schemes for metastatic lesions in each patient and found that their 
life expectancy shared no significance given the restricting subjected 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated a clinical phenomenon after using immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and presented a necessity for implementing large scales 
clinical studies to manage NSCLC-oriented liver metastasis.

BACKGROUND: There are a very few studies focusing on the individual-based 
survival with a long follow-up time.
AIM: To identify predictors and determine their joint predictive value for 
longevity using individual-based outcome measures.
METHODS: Data were drawn from Tampere Longitudinal Study on Aging (TamELSA), a 
study of individuals' age 60-89 years (N = 1450) with a mortality follow-up of 
up to 35 years. Two measures of longevity were used: the longevity difference 
(LD) and realized probability of dying (RPD), both of which compare each 
individual's longevity with their life expectancy as derived from population 
life tables. Independent variables were categorized into five domains: 
sociodemographic, health and functioning, subjective experiences, social 
activities, and living conditions. Linear regression models were used in three 
steps: bivariate analysis for each variable, multivariate analysis based on 
backward elimination for each domain, and one final model.
RESULTS: The most important predictors of both outcomes were marital status, 
years smoked regularly, mobility, self-rated health, endocrine and metabolic 
diseases, respiratory diseases, and unwillingness to do things or lack of 
energy. The explained variance in longevity was 13.8% for LD and 14.1% for RPD. 
This demonstrated a large proportion of unexplained error margins for the 
prediction of individual longevity, even though many known predictors were used.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Several predictors associated with longer life were 
found. Yet, on an individual level, it remains difficult to predict who will 
live longer than their age peers. The stochastic element in the process of aging 
and in death may affect this prediction.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe and interpret differences in 
major cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality during 60 years between Northern 
European and Southern European cohorts of the Seven Countries Study of 
Cardiovascular Diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Northern Europe included two cohorts from Finland and one 
from the Netherlands, and Southern Europe included two cohorts from Italy and 
two from Greece, for a total of 2360 and 2792 CVD-free men, respectively, at 
entry examination. Coronary heart disease (CHD), STROKE and other Heart Diseases 
of Uncertain Etiology (HDUE) deaths were the outcomes and Cox models were solved 
separately based on 12 risk factors.
RESULTS: In 60 years, overall death rates were 99.8% in both Northern and 
Southern Europe and the pooled CVD rates were 46.9% (significantly higher) and 
42.2%, respectively: CHD mortality was higher in Northern Europe, whereas STROKE 
and HDUE mortality were higher in Southern Europe. Significant Cox coefficients 
for both areas (but not significantly different between areas) were age, smoking 
habits, SBP and serum cholesterol for CHD, and only age and SBP did so for 
STROKE and HDUE. Age at death was lower for CHD, intermediate for STROKE and 
higher for HDUE in both areas.
CONCLUSION: The advantage for Southern Europe was small in terms of overall CVD 
death rates, but definitely larger in terms of expectancy of life due to the 
differences in age at death in the three types of CVD mortality. Mean entry 
levels of serum cholesterol, 50 mg/dl higher in Northern Europe than in Southern 
Europe are a major culprit of these outcomes.

A Review on the Concepts for Initially Unresectable Liver Tumors - Bridge to 
Surgery.

Andacoglu O, Ozkan O, Sekmen U, Dibekoglu C, Tokat Y.

Surgical treatments of advanced tumors have expanded in the last two decades as 
a result of ad-vances in surgical techniques, advanced interventional radiology 
methods, improved intensive care unit settings and increased overall life 
expectancy. Advanced liver tumors represent a broad category from various 
malignancies such as liver metastasis or native liver tumors. Not uncom-monly 
these tumors are not amenable to curative treatment and require down-staging, or 
local control at the initial diagnosis. Herein we discuss the portal vein 
embolization (PVE), transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with Yttrium-90 
(Y-90), and surgical options namely, two-staged hepatectomy (TSH), and 
associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatecto-my 
(ALPPS) as bridging strategies for definitive surgical treatment.

Patients with chronic ulcerative and Crohn's colitis are at increased risk for 
colorectal neoplasia(CRN [dysplasia and cancer]) compared to the general 
population. Risk factors for CRN include extent of colitis, cumulative 
inflammatory burden, family history of colorectal cancer, and primary sclerosing 
cholangitis. Best practices to prevent CRN include control of colonic 
inflammation, high quality surveillance colonoscopy with or without enhanced 
imaging techniques, resection of visible dysplasia if possible, and colectomy in 
patients with unresectable dysplasia, invisible multifocal low grade dysplasia, 
or invisible high grade dysplasia. Cessation of dysplasia surveillance is 
individualized and should involve shared decision making based on factors 
including but not limited to chronologic age, frailty, co-morbid conditions, 
life expectancy, results of prior surveillance exams, and risk factors for CRN.

OBJECTIVE: Self-management of chronic diseases is regarded as dynamic experience 
which is always evolving and that requires constant adjustment. As unexpected 
and new shifts in diseases occur, patients tend to abandon acquired behaviours 
calling into question their sustainability over time. Developing a daily 
self-management routine as a response to lifestyle changes is considered to 
facilitate self-management performance. However, fitting self-management 
recommendations in one's daily life activities is a constant challenge. In this 
review, we describe the performance of self-management routines within daily 
settings in people living with chronic conditions with the aim of identifying 
factors that challenge its integration in daily life.
DESIGN: Scoping review.
DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO on 
February 2022.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included qualitative studies on self-management 
experience, in English, with adult participants, original and peer-reviewed, and 
depicting the performance of self-management activities in one's own 
environment.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened titles and 
abstracts. After agreement, one reviewer screened the full text of relevant 
articles and extracted the data. The data were synthesised and analysed 
thematically. PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist was used for 
reporting the steps.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. The thematic analysis brought up two 
overreaching themes. The first one is the Environment support with three 
subthemes: family and cultural norms; health professionals and guiding 
communication; and society and disease perceptions. The second theme is 
comprehension gap with two subthemes: reading the body and applying information.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of self-management requirements in a daily routine 
is affected by the patients' inability to apply disease knowledge in different 
context and by the challenge of understanding body symptoms and predicting body 
reactions in advance.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Life expectancy is considered in treatment decision-making for 
non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). We explored the factors related to overall 
survival (OS) and investigated the association between OS and life expectancy in 
patients with non-metastatic PCa according to various treatment modalities.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 714 patients with 
non-metastatic PCa between 2006 and 2010 at our institute. The treatment 
modalities were classified as follows: radical prostatectomy (RP), androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT), brachytherapy (BT) and external beam radiation 
therapy (EBRT). We defined life expectancy according to an abridged life table 
published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan.
RESULTS: The median age and initial prostate-specific antigen levels at 
treatment were 71 years and 8.8 ng/mL, respectively. Advanced age, Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI) ≥1, cT3a stage and ADT were independent poor prognostic 
factors for OS. OS and life expectancy did not significantly differ in all 
patients (p=0.32) and in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
high-risk group (p=0.059). In patients with a life expectancy of <10 years, the 
OS was significantly shorter than life expectancy (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with non-metastatic PCa may live beyond their life 
expectancy regardless of the type of therapy and NCCN risk classification, and 
patients with a life expectancy of <10 years may benefit from BT rather than ADT 
and EBRT.

BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy among 
older people, especially in people living with HIV (PLWH) with an increased life 
expectancy due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Consequently, there is 
a higher risk of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), potential 
drug-drug interactions (DI), and problems of non-adherence to treatment (NAC) in 
older PLWH. PIMDINAC criteria (potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), 
drug-drug interactions (DI), and non-adherence to treatment (NAC)) purport to 
jointly analyse these problems. The purpose of the study was to compare the 
prevalence of PIMDINAC criteria among elderly PLWH and non-infected patients 
with chronic diseases, and to determine whether HIV infection constitutes a 
predictor of the presence of PIMDINAC criteria, totally or partially.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted between February and June 2020. 
HIV positive patients aged ≥65 years were compared with a group of patients with 
chronic conditions attending the outpatient hospital pharmacy service.
RESULTS: The study involved 140 patients: 47 HIV positive and 93 HIV negative, 
and mean age was 69 versus 73 years, respectively (p=0.062). The prevalence of 
total PIMDINAC criteria was similar between the groups (12.5 vs 10.8%, p=0.505). 
In relation to inappropriate medication, no differences were observed between 
groups (48.9 vs 55.9%, p=0434). Drug-drug interactions were higher in patients 
with chronic conditions (52.7 vs 25.5%, p=0.002) compared with non-adherence, 
which was higher in people with HIV (22.6 vs 65.6%, p<0.001). No differences in 
polypharmacy (≥6 and 11 drugs) rates were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: PIMDINAC criteria were highly prevalent in older PLWH, similar to 
non-infected patients. HIV infection in older people was associated with a lower 
risk of drug-drug interactions. However, non-adherence was a risk factor 
compared with age matched controls. Deprescribing strategies, including a 
capability-motivation-opportunity pharmaceutical care model based intervention 
should be implemented in clinical routines.

Data from nearly 1000 species reveal the upper bound to rates of biomass 
production achievable by natural selection across the Tree of Life. For 
heterotrophs, maximum growth rates scale positively with organism size in 
bacteria but negatively in eukaryotes, whereas for phototrophs, the scaling is 
negligible for cyanobacteria and weakly negative for eukaryotes. These results 
have significant implications for understanding the bioenergetic consequences of 
the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and of the expansion of some 
groups of the latter into multicellularity. The magnitudes of the scaling 
coefficients for eukaryotes are significantly lower than expected under any 
proposed physical-constraint model. Supported by genomic, bioenergetic, and 
population-genetic data and theory, an alternative hypothesis for the observed 
negative scaling in eukaryotes postulates that growth-diminishing mutations with 
small effects passively accumulate with increasing organism size as a 
consequence of associated increases in the power of random genetic drift. In 
contrast, conditional on the structural and functional features of ribosomes, 
natural selection has been able to promote bacteria with the fastest possible 
growth rates, implying minimal conflicts with both bioenergetic constraints and 
random genetic drift. If this extension of the drift-barrier hypothesis is 
correct, the interpretations of comparative studies of biological traits that 
have traditionally ignored differences in population-genetic environments will 
require revisiting.

OBJECTIVE: To present estimates of prevalence and incidence of and contributors 
to central nervous system (CNS) cancers, death, years of life lost, years lived 
with disability, and disability-adjusted life years from 1990 to 2019 in North 
Africa and the Middle East.
METHODS: Primary measures were retrieved from Global Burden of Disease 2019. 
Contribution of various factors to observed incidence and mortality changes was 
investigated with decomposition and age-period-cohort analyses.
RESULTS: In 2019, 27,529 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 18,554-32,579; percent 
change compared with 1990: +152.5%) new CNS cancers and 17,773 (95% 
UI:12,096-20,936; percent change compared with 1990: +111.5%) deaths occurred. 
Meanwhile, 71.0% increase led to 71,6271 (95% UI: 493,932-848,226) 
disability-adjusted life years in 2019 with a halved years of life lost/years 
lived with disability ratio of 66.3% (proxy of worse care quality). Altogether, 
97,195 (95% UI: 64,216-115,621; percent change compared with 1990: +280.5%) 
patients with prevalent cases were alive in 2019. All decomposed indices, 
including aging, cause-specific incidence, and population growth, contributed 
substantially to increased incidence of CNS cancers. Moreover, age brackets, 
study period (1990-2019), and 5-year cohorts all demonstrated positive effects, 
while age had a mixed influence in different age groups. Palestine harbored the 
highest age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate in 2019 (232.0 [95% 
UI: 175.6-279.5]), while Tunisia had the lowest (41.8 [95% UI: 27.6-57.1] per 
100,000). The greatest burden increase was found in Saudi Arabia (32.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of CNS cancers is rising in North Africa and the Middle 
East, with major heterogeneities among countries. Improved early detection and 
health care access across countries are required to bridge inequalities and 
address the rising burden of CNS malignancies.
