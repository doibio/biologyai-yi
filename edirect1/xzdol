OBJECTIVE: To date, there are no literature reports combining the relationship 
between depression and chronic heart failure (CHF) in relations to selective 
nutritional, cardiac and laboratory parameters. The aim of this study was to 
correlate the rs1799964 genotypes in TNF-α with clinical outcomes of depressive 
CHF patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 94 CHF patients were enrolled to assess depression 
prevalence and to compare values of cardiac, laboratory and nutritional 
parameters between depressed and non-depressed patients with different rs1799964 
genotypes.
RESULTS: Depression was diagnosed in 66 individuals (70.2%). We noted 
significant reduction of EF% in CC genotype carriers compared to other patients 
(mean EF%: 36±11 CC vs. 44±14 CT and 46±7 TT; p=0.023) and worse outcomes in 
NYHA examination (p=0.033). We noticed a significant increase in serum CRP and 
TNF-α in CC patients (p=0.003 and p<0.001). Compared with T allele carriers, the 
CHF patients bearing CC genotype were more frequently diagnosed as cachectic 
(cachexia incidence for CC - 80% vs. 28% for CT and 38.7% for TT; p=0.017). CC 
genotype of rs1799964 was found as unfavorable factor affecting survival of 
depressive CHF patients (HR=8.87; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the CC genotype in patients with depression and CHF 
can be considered an unfavorable prognostic factor related to the risk of 
shortening the life expectancy and deteriorating its quality, which is reflected 
in the severity of inflammation.

The grapevine phylloxera Daktulosphaira vitifoliae (Fitch) is the pest insect of 
greatest importance in grapevine. The objective of study was to evaluate the 
occurrence of overwintering eggs in seedlings of 'Paulsen 1103' (Vitis 
berlandieri × Vitis rupestris) and evaluate the biology and fertility life table 
of D. vitifoliae on five grape cultivars: 'Bordô' (Vitis labrusca), 'Cabernet 
Sauvignon' (Vitis vinifera), 'BRS Lorena' (Vitis vinifera × Seyval [Seibell 
5656-Rayon d'Or]), 'Magnolia' (Vitis rotundifolia), and 'Paulsen 1103'. In the 
field, overwintering eggs were found to be present in 78% of 'Paulsen 1103' 
seedlings, on the trunk of the seedlings. In the laboratory, phylloxera was 
found to complete the biological cycle (egg to adult) in roots of 'BRS Lorena', 
'Bordô', and 'Cabernet Sauvignon'. Nymphs did not complete development on roots 
of 'Paulsen 1103' and 'Magnolia', with 100% first instar mortality. Adult 
females feeding on 'Bordô' roots showed the lowest total fecundity (20.9 eggs 
per female), differing from insects feeding on 'Cabernet Sauvignon' roots (207.8 
eggs per female). Based on the fertility life table, roots of 'Cabernet 
Sauvignon' provided the best reproduction rate (Ro = 219), intrinsic rate of 
increase (rm = 0.197 d) and time between generations (T = 21.5 d). The presence 
of overwintering eggs on the trunk of the rootstock 'Paulsen 1103' may promote 
the survival and dispersal of the insect. Lignified roots of the rootstock 
'Paulsen 1103' and the cultivar 'Magnolia' do not allow the development of D. 
vitifoliae, with 'Cabernet Sauvignon' being the most suitable for the 
development of the insect.

Comment in
    Eur Heart J. 2022 Jan 03;:

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of 
offering population genomic screening to all young adults in Australia to detect 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We designed a decision analytic Markov model to compare the 
current standard of care for heterozygous FH diagnosis in Australia 
(opportunistic cholesterol screening and genetic cascade testing) with the 
alternate strategy of population genomic screening of adults aged 18-40 years to 
detect pathogenic variants in the LDLR/APOB/PCSK9 genes. We used a validated 
cost-adaptation method to adapt findings to eight high-income countries. The 
model captured coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity/mortality over a lifetime 
horizon, from healthcare and societal perspectives. Risk of CHD, treatment 
effects, prevalence, and healthcare costs were estimated from published studies. 
Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), discounted 5% annually. Sensitivity analyses 
were undertaken to explore the impact of key input parameters on the robustness 
of the model. Over the lifetime of the population (4 167 768 men; 4 129 961 
women), the model estimated a gain of 33 488years of life lived and 51 790 QALYs 
due to CHD prevention. Population genomic screening for FH would be 
cost-effective from a healthcare perspective if the per-test cost was ≤AU$250, 
yielding an ICER of <AU$28 000 per QALY gained. From a societal perspective, 
population genomic screening would be cost-saving. ICERs from societal 
perspective remained cost-saving after adaptation to other countries.
CONCLUSION: Based on our model, offering population genomic screening to all 
young adults for FH could be cost-effective, at testing costs that are feasible.

The three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin is intrinsically associated 
with gene regulation and cell function1-3. Methods based on chromatin 
conformation capture have mapped chromatin structures in neuronal systems such 
as in vitro differentiated neurons, neurons isolated through 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting from cortical tissues pooled from different 
animals and from dissociated whole hippocampi4-6. However, changes in chromatin 
organization captured by imaging, such as the relocation of Bdnf away from the 
nuclear periphery after activation7, are invisible with such approaches8. Here 
we developed immunoGAM, an extension of genome architecture mapping (GAM)2,9, to 
map 3D chromatin topology genome-wide in specific brain cell types, without 
tissue disruption, from single animals. GAM is a ligation-free technology that 
maps genome topology by sequencing the DNA content from thin (about 220 nm) 
nuclear cryosections. Chromatin interactions are identified from the increased 
probability of co-segregation of contacting loci across a collection of nuclear 
slices. ImmunoGAM expands the scope of GAM to enable the selection of specific 
cell types using low cell numbers (approximately 1,000 cells) within a complex 
tissue and avoids tissue dissociation2,10. We report cell-type specialized 3D 
chromatin structures at multiple genomic scales that relate to patterns of gene 
expression. We discover extensive 'melting' of long genes when they are highly 
expressed and/or have high chromatin accessibility. The contacts most specific 
of neuron subtypes contain genes associated with specialized processes, such as 
addiction and synaptic plasticity, which harbour putative binding sites for 
neuronal transcription factors within accessible chromatin regions. Moreover, 
sensory receptor genes are preferentially found in heterochromatic compartments 
in brain cells, which establish strong contacts across tens of megabases. Our 
results demonstrate that highly specific chromatin conformations in brain cells 
are tightly related to gene regulation mechanisms and specialized functions.

Malaria still is the most fatal parasitic disease affecting 50% of the world's 
population. Although annual deaths attributed to malaria has reduced, crucial 
importance of its prevention and treatment remains a priority for health care 
systems and researchers. The worldwide increase in resistance to most common 
antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, their unpleasant side effects and low 
efficiencies persuade researchers to prioritize finding alternative drugs 
including herbal medication from plant roots. The present study aimed to examine 
in vitro and in vivo effects of hydroalcoholic extract of herbal medicinal 
plant, Allium paradoxum, on growth rate in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium 
berghei. The cytotoxicity assay was performed for hydroalcoholic extract of A. 
paradoxum. The 3D7 strain of P. falciparum was cultured. The IC50 assay and 
enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase were performed. BALB/c mice were 
infected with P. berghei in vivo. Toxicity and histopathological changes in the 
tissues of liver and kidney were also examined. The highest efficacy of A. 
paradoxum extract was observed at 80 μg/mL in P. falciparum culture resulting in 
60.43% growth inhibition compared to control groups. The significantly highest 
parasite growth inhibition with 88.71% was seen in the mice infected with P. 
berghei when administered with 400 mg/kg extract compared to control groups. No 
significant changes in the liver and kidney cells were observed between 
experimental and control groups. The study showed that A. paradoxum extract 
exhibited significant antimalarial properties in vitro on P. falciparum and in 
vivo in mice infected with P. berghei. There was no significant toxicity in the 
liver and kidney of the treated mice.

This study evaluated the potential of alternative treatments against larval 
stages of Lernaea cyprinacea. For in vitro test, the nanoemulsified oils of 
Pinus sp. acicule and oleoresin were evaluated, along with Biogermex® 
(commercial product based on citrus biomass). For this, the motility of five 
larvae of the same stage (nauplii or copepodite) were evaluated in a 96-well 
microplate. Using the best results, on the in vivo test, fries of Rhamdia quelen 
were submitted to a long-term immersion bath (96 h) containing different 
concentrations of the product diluted directly in the water. It was possible to 
notice the antiparasitic potential of the oleoresin and the acicule of Pinus 
sp., as well as the citrus biomass extract against the parasites. The 
nanoemulsified oils successfully inhibited the development of nauplii (10 mg L-1 
in 24 h) and the fries showed to be tolerant to the presence of the compound 
(LC50 96 h-16.74 mg L-1). The concentration of 30.5 mg L-1 of Biogermex® 
eliminated the copepodites within 24 h, being more efficient than Pinus sp. when 
tested at the same stage, at the times analyzed. The results obtained indicate a 
potential use of these compounds as prophylactic agents against L. cyprinacea.

Living arrangements of older adults have often been studied as a measure of the 
support available to them. Given the rapidly ageing and low fertility context of 
Singapore where the prevalence of older adults living alone and without children 
is expected to increase, we construct multistate life tables to estimate the 
number of years that older persons can expect to live in different living 
arrangements at a population level (population-based) as well as based on their 
initial living arrangement (status-based). We focus particularly on whether 
there are gender differences in the expected years of life in different living 
arrangement states. We use the Panel on Health and Ageing of Singaporean 
Elderly, a 2009 nationally representative survey of 4990 Singaporeans aged 
60 years and older, with follow-up surveys in 2011 and 2015. In calculating the 
probabilities of transition between different states, we control for number of 
children, housing type, and time-varying ADL limitations. We find that at age 
60, women can expect to spend more than twice the proportion (18%) of their 
remaining lives living alone compared to men (7%). Status-based estimates 
indicate that the proportion of remaining years living with a child is higher 
for women initially living alone, with a spouse only or already with a child, 
compared to males. Our results indicate that while older women are more likely 
to live alone compared to their male counterparts, older women living alone are 
also more likely to transition to living with children. Our research sheds light 
on the importance of expanding research on life expectancy beyond health, to 
consider analysis using other forms of social stratification, particularly 
gender differences in states of living arrangement.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked condition caused by a 
deficiency of functional dystrophin protein. Patients experience progressive 
muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy and have a decreased life expectancy. Standards 
of care, including treatment with steroids, and multidisciplinary approaches 
have extended the life expectancy and improved the quality of life of patients. 
In the last 30 years, several compounds have been assessed in preclinical and 
clinical studies for their ability to restore functional dystrophin levels or to 
modify pathways involved in DMD pathophysiology. However, there is still an 
unmet need with regards to a disease-modifying treatment for DMD and the 
attrition rate between early-phase and late-phase clinical development remains 
high. Currently, there are 40 compounds in clinical development for DMD, 
including gene therapy and antisense oligonucleotides for exon skipping. Only 
five of them have received conditional approval in one jurisdiction subject to 
further proof of efficacy. In this review, we present data of another 16 
compounds that failed to complete clinical development, despite positive results 
in early phases of development in some cases. We examine the reasons for the 
high attrition rate and we suggest solutions to avoid similar mistakes in the 
future.

Introduction: While most people with cerebral palsy (CP) will have a life 
expectancy similar to that of the general population, international research has 
primarily focused on childhood and adolescence; and knowledge about the quality 
of life (QoL) of young adults with CP, its trajectories, and associated factors 
remains scarce. Methods: This longitudinal study included young adults with CP 
living in five European regions and who had previously participated in the 
SPARCLE cohort as children and/or adolescents. Their QoL in the psychological 
well-being and social relationships domains was estimated using age-appropriate 
validated instruments (KIDSCREEN-52 in childhood/adolescence and WHOQOL-Bref in 
young adulthood). We used generalized linear mixed-effect models with random 
intercept to estimate long-term trajectories of QoL in both domains and to 
investigate whether severity of impairment, pain, and seizure influenced these 
trajectories. We sought to identify potentially different trajectories of QoL 
from childhood to adulthood using a shape-based clustering method. Results: In 
total, 164 young adults with CP aged 22-27 years participated in the study. 
Psychological well-being linearly decreased by 0.78 points (scale 0-100) per 
year (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.99 to -0.56) from childhood to young 
adulthood, whereas QoL in the social relationships domain increased (β 
coefficient 1.24, 95% CI 0.92-1.55). Severity of impairment was associated with 
reduced QoL in all life periods of the study (childhood, adolescence, and young 
adulthood): motor impairment with social relationships, and more nuancedly 
intellectual disability with psychological well-being and social relationships. 
At all periods, frequent pain significantly reduced psychological well-being, 
and seizures were associated with lower QoL in the social relationships domain. 
In both domains, we identified a group of individuals with CP who presented a 
reverse trajectory compared with the general QoL trajectory. Conclusion: 
Identification of QoL trajectories and their associated factors yields improved 
knowledge about the experience of individuals with CP until young adulthood. 
Further studies are needed to better understand the determinants that have the 
greatest influence on the different shapes of long-term trajectories of QoL.

BACKGROUND: Objective responses to first-line systemic chemotherapy in 
metastatic pancreatic cancer patients are seen in less than one third of cases. 
Unfortunately, a significant amount will have disease progression (PD) on their 
first restaging imaging. With patients' short life expectancy, it is crucial for 
clinicians to be prudent when deciding whom and when to treat. Our study aimed 
to evaluate outcomes of patients that progressed on their first restaging 
imaging on 1st line therapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed between 2010-2017 whose 
first restaging imaging demonstrated PD. The primary outcome was overall 
survival (OS) from metastatic diagnosis date to death. Patients who were lost to 
follow-up were excluded.
RESULTS: Out of 262 total patients reviewed, 98 patients (37%) were included. 
Sixty-five (66%) received 2nd line therapy, and 33 (34%) did not. Reasons 
patients did not pursue 2nd line therapy were performance status (PS) decline, 
organ dysfunction, or patient choice for alternative therapy. Median ages for 
patients who did and did not receive 2nd line therapy were 61 and 67, 
respectively (P<0.001). More patients had a poor PS at the time of initial 
diagnosis in the non-2nd line therapy group (7.5% vs. 31.0%, P=0.021). Median OS 
for those receiving 2nd line therapy was 9 months (95% CI: 7-11 months) compared 
to 4 months (95% CI: 3-5 months) for those not receiving 2nd-line therapy 
(P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although likely biased due to better performance status and younger 
age, our patients who progressed rapidly on 1st line therapy showed an OS 
benefit if they received 2nd line therapy. These results suggest that patients 
maintaining a good PS after immediate progression on 1st line therapy should be 
offered 2nd line therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Osteochondrosis of humeral capitellum (Panner's disease) is a rare 
condition. Very few cases are reported in the literature and may be overlooked 
or misdiagnosed. Most cases are unilateral in distribution and occur in young 
boys during the first decade of life. It is often difficult to distinguish 
osteochondrosis from osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum that 
occurs in older children and adolescents in the second decade of life.
CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 6-year-old boy who presented with pain, 
subtle swelling and limited extension in his right elbow following a fall. 
Diagnosis of Panner's disease was made 2 weeks later on follow-up based on 
classical features on plain radiograph of joint effusion, irregular delineation 
of the articular contour, and faint sclerosis of the capitellum with a 
radiolucent line in the subchondral bone. The patient had uneventful full 
functional recovery with conservative treatment: Rest, temporary immobilization, 
and subsequent remobilization.
CONCLUSION: Osteochondrosis of humeral capitellum though rare is a known 
condition. It may be overlooked or misdiagnosed. High degree of awareness is 
required and diagnosis can be made with utmost care based on the age of 
presentation, clinical signs and clearly recognizable plain radiographic 
features of joint effusion, irregular articular outline with radiolucent line in 
subchondral bone and faint sclerosis of capitellum.

BACKGROUND: As the life expectancy of elderly people has drastically increased, 
the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in this population 
has proportionally grown. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to all 
forms of cognitive disorder associated with cerebrovascular disease. 
Homocysteine has recently been recognized as a contributor to the 
pathomechanisms involved in cognitive impairment. B vitamins, such as folic 
acid, are known to be effective in lowering homocysteine levels.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the efficacy of folic acid in patients with VCI.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on folic 
acid treatments for VCI. Only randomized controlled trials studies that compared 
the efficacy of folic acid to placebo or other interventions were considered, 
irrespective of publication status, year of publication, and languages. Two 
independent reviewers searched the Medline via Ovid, EMBASE and Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (Central) journal databases up to July 2021 and 
independently appraised the included studies. We used mean difference outcome 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to calculate the change of Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), cognitive function domain, and concentration of 
homocysteine.
RESULTS: We found three studies comparing folic acid with placebo and one study 
comparing folic acid with other interventions. There is only slight evidence 
that the MMSE score in patients who received Folic Acid increased 0.3 point 
higher compared to the placebo group after 24 months (95% CI:-0.12-0.37; 
p=0.31). There is very strong evidence that the concentration of Homocysteine in 
the Folic Acid group became 6.16 μmol/L lower compared to the placebo group 
after 6 months (95% CI:2.32-8.21 lower; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows the effectiveness of folic acid in lowering plasma 
homocysteine concentration after 6 months period compared to placebo. However, 
this effect is not accompanied by improvement in cognitive function.

OBJECTIVES: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is an uncommon disease known 
for its acute phase mortality and long-term sequelae. The objective was to 
assess the impact of IMD on post-discharge mortality risk and dependence on the 
French state for financial aid.
METHODS: A 6-year retrospective analysis in the national insurance database 
(SNIIRAM) assessed mortality in IMD cases (both during acute phase and 
post-discharge) and matched controls as well as benefit claims (i.e., for salary 
loss compensation [SLC], long-term sickness [ALD] and complementary health 
insurance [CMUc]). Observed survival data were extrapolated to estimate lifetime 
life expectancy following IMD.
RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2017, 3532 incident IMD cases were hospitalised in 
France (peak in < 2 years and 15-24 year olds), of which 23.3% developed 
sequelae. With an average follow-up of 2.8 years, 12.9% of cases vs. 3.2% of 
controls died (p < 0.0001), with significantly more cases than controls dying 
both during the acute phase and post-discharge. Around a third of these deaths 
occurred post-discharge. Extrapolation to lifetime life expectancy estimated 
that having IMD at any age significantly reduces life expectancy in survivors of 
the acute disease phase, e.g., by around 16 years for cases aged 0-50 years. IMD 
cases in France were significantly more likely to receive state-funded SLC 
(relative risk [RR] 3.9, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.3-6.4) and ALD 
benefits (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.71-2.00).
CONCLUSIONS: IMD has a significant impact on mortality post-discharge, expected 
to persist over a lifetime. In addition to long-term sequelae, the financial 
burden extends beyond the healthcare sector. These results highlight the 
importance of IMD prevention (e.g., vaccination).

Plain Language Summary: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is an uncommon 
disease mainly affecting children, with severe consequences such as a risk of 
dying within hours of symptoms and a risk of developing long-term conditions 
affecting health, learning and ability to work. Little is known of the risk of 
dying in survivors after discharge from hospital or of survivors’ financial 
support needs. The French national insurance claims database (SNIIRAM) was 
reviewed for data on IMD patients hospitalised between 2012 and 2017 and matched 
controls without IMD. Data, available following IMD hospitalisation for an 
average of around 3 years, were extrapolated to estimate the lifelong impact of 
the disease. Among 3532 hospitalised IMD cases, the study found that nearly 13% 
died, of which a third of deaths occurred post-discharge. The cases who survived 
the acute disease phase were also more likely to require government funds 
because of loss of salary or to cover long-term healthcare costs. In addition to 
the well-known acute phase burden of IMD, this study has shown that there is a 
long-term effect on risk of dying and on need for government support. This 
demonstrates the importance of prevention, for example, by vaccination.

Center Wuerzburg, Germany.

PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of 
ureteral embolization exclusively using Amplatzer Vascular Plugs (AVPs) in the 
management of ureteral leakages.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 7 patients with ureteral leakages and 
fistulas having undergone transrenal ureteral embolization with AVPs was 
performed. In all cases, AVPs were deployed via a preexisting percutaneous 
transrenal nephrostomy tube. Technical and clinical success as well as 
complications were evaluated.
RESULTS: During a 4-year study period, 11 ureters in 7 patients were embolized 
using AVPs. In one case additional coil embolization was conducted. Technical 
success in terms of sufficient occlusion of the treated ureter was achieved in 
100% of the procedures. Median size of used plugs was 16.0 mm (range, 12-18 mm). 
Number of deployed AVPs ranged between one and three. Median procedural time was 
24.00 minutes, and a median dose area product of 58.92 Gy•cm2 was documented. No 
procedure-related complications occurred. During a median follow-up period of 7 
weeks, recurrence of the treated leak could not be observed.
CONCLUSION: Ureteric plug embolization in patients with ureteral leakages or 
fistulas is a feasible, effective, and safe technique, even without the addition 
of tissue adhesives. However, due to the often limited prognosis and life 
expectancy of the affected patients, long-term experiences are still lacking.
