BACKGROUND: Studies of long-term outcomes of discrete subaortic stenosis are 
rare. Therefore, we reviewed the long-term outcomes of fibromuscular resection 
in children with subaortic stenosis over 26 years from a single institution.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all children (n=72) who 
underwent resection of subaortic obstruction for discrete subaortic stenosis 
between 1989 and 2015.
RESULTS: Median age at surgery was 5.0 years (2.7-7.6 years). There were no 
operative deaths but three late deaths (4.2%, 3/72). Overall Kaplan-Meier 
survival at 10 years was 93.0 ± 3.9% (95% CI: 79.6, 97.7). Peak instantaneous 
left ventricular outflow tract Doppler gradient decreased from 74.2±36.7mmHg 
(16.0-242.0mmHg) preoperatively to 12.8±7.4mmHg (2.6-36.0mmHg) postoperatively 
(p<0.001). Mean left ventricular outflow tract Doppler gradient decreased from 
42.4±17.2mmHg (12.0-98.0) preoperatively to 7.5±2.7mmHg (1.4-19.3mmHg) 
postoperatively (p<0.001). However, over the mean follow-up period of 7.8±6.1 
years (0.1-25.2 years), 29.0% (20/69) of patients had recurrence and 18.8% 
(13/69) required reoperation at median time of 4.8 years (3.1-9.1 years) after 
the initial repair. Freedom from reoperation at 10 years was 71.1±7.1% (95% CI: 
54.6, 82.3). Risk factors for reoperation were age less than five years at 
initial repair (p=0.036) and extension of the membrane to the aortic valve 
(p=0.001). Aortic insufficiency was present in 54.2% (39/72) of patients 
preoperatively. Progression of aortic insufficiency occurred in 38.9% (28/72). 
Involvement of the aortic valve at initial repair was associated with need for 
subsequent aortic valve repair or replacement (p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Resection of subaortic obstruction is associated with low mortality 
and morbidity. Recurrence and reoperation rates are high and progression of 
aortic insufficiency following subaortic resection is common. Therefore, these 
patients warrant close follow-up into adult life.

[PECULIARITIES OF DIAGNOSTICS AND TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT 
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION].

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of invasive strategies for 
the treatment of 306 patients with recurrent myocardial infarction (IM) admitted 
to our clinic in 2003-2007. We compared the results of three approaches: various 
forms of transdermal coronary interventions (TDI) including delayed (24-72 hr) 
ones (n = 30), surgical myocardial revascularization within 8-12 weeks after the 
onset of recurrent myocardial infarction (n = 25), and conservative therapy (n = 
251). Overall cardiovascular lethality was estimated during 5 years in 101 
patients. It was shown that recurrent myocardial infarction is a predictor of 
high risk of death associated, in the absence of reperfusion therapy, with high 
intra-hospital and long-term lethality. TD1 soon after recurrent IM does not 
exclude possibility of its application in a later period. Various interventions 
including delayed ones markedly decrease the frequency of complications and 
lethal outcome that remains high in their absence. At the same time, severe 
lesions of the coronary bed in many patients with recurrent MI limit the 
possibility of using TDI and should be regarded as indications for planned 
surgical myocardial revascularization. Coronary bypass surgery after myocardial 
scarring prevents progress of left ventricle dysfunction, improves its 
contractility and increases life expectancy. Enhanced availability of 
reperfusion strategies in the form of TDI and/or delayed surgical myocardial 
revascularization opens up new possibilities for effective treatment of 
recurrent Ml.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a disease where detection preceding 
clinical symptoms significantly increases the life expectancy of patients. In 
this study, a recombinant antibody microarray platform was used to analyze 213 
Chinese plasma samples from PDAC patients and normal control (NC) individuals. 
The cohort was stratified according to disease stage, i.e. resectable disease 
(stage I/II), locally advanced (stage III) and metastatic disease (stage IV). 
Support vector machine analysis showed that all PDAC stages could be 
discriminated from controls and that the accuracy increased with disease 
progression, from stage I to IV. Patients with stage I/II PDAC could be 
discriminated from NC with high accuracy based on a plasma protein signature, 
indicating a possibility for early diagnosis and increased detection rate of 
surgically resectable tumors.

BACKGROUND: In multiple studies, chronic renal insufficiency has been associated 
with increased risk of periprocedural stroke, cardiac complications, and death 
following carotid revascularization. Renal transplantation has been shown to 
reduce cardiovascular risk and improve survival; outcomes after carotid 
revascularization in renal transplant patients however are unknown. In this 
study, we evaluate periprocedural and long-term risks after carotid 
endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) in a cohort of renal 
transplant patients.
METHODS: We studied all renal transplant patients in the United States Renal 
Data System who underwent CEA or CAS between January 2006 and December 2011. 
Patient outcomes were determined by linking with the Medicare database. 
Propensity score matched logistic and cox regression analyses were employed to 
evaluate perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death and 
long-term stroke and death.
RESULTS: Of the 462 revascularizations for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis 
between 2006 and 2011, 387 (84%) were CEA and 75 (16%) were CAS. The 2 groups 
did not differ in age, gender, sex, race, or baseline medical characteristics. 
There was no significant difference in perioperative stroke, MI, or death rates 
in the CEA cohort (4.7%, 4.4%, and 1.3%, respectively) compared with the CAS 
cohort (5.3%, 2.7%, and 4.0%, respectively). Stroke-free survival for CEA versus 
CAS was 93% vs. 92% at 1 year, 90% vs. 87% at 2 years, 88% vs. 87% at 3 years, 
and 84% vs. 82% at 4 years (P = 0.81). Overall patient survival for CEA versus 
CAS was 89% vs. 88% at 1 year, 77% vs. 75% at 2 years, 66% for both at 3 years, 
and 53% vs. 48% at 4 years (P = 0.68). In propensity score matched Cox 
regression analysis, there was no difference in risk of perioperative stroke or 
MI or in long-term stroke or death for CAS compared with CEA.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate outcomes following CEA and CAS 
in renal transplant patients. The incidence of perioperative complications in 
this group is higher than the maximum recommended by the Society of Vascular 
Surgery, and the benefits of revascularization may be outweighed by the excess 
periprocedural morbidity and reduced life expectancy of these patients.

Radiotherapy for brain metastases has become more multifaceted. Indeed, with the 
improvement of the patient's life expectancy, side effects must be undeniably 
avoided and the retreatments or multiple treatments are common. The cognitive 
side effects should be warned and the most modern techniques of radiation 
therapy are used regularly to reach this goal. The new classifications of 
patients with brain metastases help guiding treatment more appropriately. 
Stereotactic radiotherapy has supplanted whole brain radiation therapy both for 
patients with metastases in place and for those who underwent surgery. 
Hippocampus protection is possible with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Its 
relevance in terms of cognitive functioning should be more clearly demonstrated 
but the requirement, for using it, is increasingly strong. While addressing 
patients in palliative phase, the treatment of brain metastases is one of the 
localisations where technical thinking is the most challenging.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in heart failure (HF) 
patients comprise a major health and economic burden, especially when 
readmission rate and length of stay (LOS) are considered. With increasing 
average life expectancy, HF prevalence continues to rise. Diseases such as 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension and ischemic heart disease continue to be the 
leading causes of HF. Current data suggest that HF is the most common cause for 
hospital admission in patients older than 65 years.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought out to compare the 30-day readmission rate 
in trauma patients who have a preexisting history of HF to those who do not have 
a history of HF. Additionally, we emphasized the effect of different cardiac 
variables in the HF group such as the pathophysiology of HF (HF with preserved 
ejection fraction [HFpEF] versus HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]) and 
the etiology of HFrEF (ischemic versus nonischemic).
METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis of 8,137 patients who were admitted to 
our hospital between 2005 and 2013 secondary to trauma with an Injury Severity 
Score <30. Data were extracted using International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision codes. Neurotrauma patients were excluded.
RESULTS: Of 8,137 trauma patients, 334 had preexisting HF, of which 169 had 
HFpEF while 165 had HFrEF). Of the 165 HFrEF cases, 121 were ischemic in 
etiology versus 44 nonischemic. Of 334 HF patients, 81 patients (24%) were 
readmitted within 30 days versus 1,068 (14%) of the non-HF patients (95% CI: 
1.52-2.25, relative risk: 1.85, P < 0.0001). Of the 81 readmitted HF patients, 
64 had HFpEF while 35 had HFrEF. There was no statistical significance observed 
in any of the endpoints in the HFpEF versus HFrEF groups. Mortality, 30-day 
readmission and LOS were all significantly higher in the ischemic versus 
nonischemic HFrEF group.
CONCLUSIONS: In our trauma population, HF patients had a significantly higher 
30-day readmission rate when compared to non-HF patients. The pathophysiology of 
HF (HFpEF versus HFrEF) did not seem to play a role. However, after subgroup 
analysis of the HFrEF group based on etiology, all endpoints including 
mortality, readmission and LOS were significantly higher in the ischemic HFrEF 
subgroup rendering this entity higher importance when treating trauma patients 
with preexisting HF.

LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and STF1 (Soybean TGACG-motif binding Factor 1) are two 
related bZIP transcription factors that play a positive role in 
photomorphogenesis and hormonal signaling. In this study, we compared full 
length STF1 and truncated STF1 overexpression lines and found that the 
C-terminal 133 amino acids (194-306) possess all the HY5-like function in 
Arabidopsis. The STF1-DC1 mutant (1-306), with a 20 amino acid deletion at the 
carboxy terminus, failed to complement the hy5 mutant phenotype, which suggests 
an intact C-terminus is required for STF1 function. To understand the role of 
the C-terminal domain in photomorphogenesis we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to 
isolate proteins that bind to the STF1 C-terminus. We isolated three soybean 
cDNAs encoding the zinc-finger proteins GmSTO, GmSTH, and GmSTH2, which interact 
with STF1. These proteins belong to a family of B-box zinc finger proteins that 
include Arabidopsis SALT TOLERANCE (STO) and STO HOMOLOG (STH) and STH2, which 
play a role in light-dependent development and gene expression. The C-terminal 
63 amino acids of STF1, containing a leucine zipper and the two N-terminal 
B-boxes, contains the domain involved in interactions between STF1 and GmSTO. In 
addition, we identified an interaction between soybean COP1 (GmCOP1) and GmSTO 
and GmSTH, as well as STF1, which strongly suggests the presence of a similar 
regulatory circuit for light signaling in soybean as in Arabidopsis. This study 
shows that photomorphogenic control requires complex molecular interactions 
among several different classes of transcription factors such as bZIP, B-box 
factors, and COP1, a ubiquitin ligase.

Patients with disseminated cancer and bone metastases have a limited life 
expectancy and therefore any treatment should have a clear beneficial effect, 
outweighing all possible downsides. This systematic review aims to identify and 
evaluate available evidence regarding function, pain, quality of life, survival 
and complications of postoperative radiotherapy (RT) after surgical 
stabilization of impending or actual pathologic fractures of the long bones due 
to bone metastases. A literature search resulted in two articles reporting on 64 
and 110 patients of whom 55% and 28% received postoperative RT, respectively. 
Both studies were retrospective cohort studies and postoperative RT had been 
administered depending on the surgeons' choice. The first study reported better 
outcomes regarding function, re-interventions and survival in patients receiving 
postoperative RT. The second study reported no significant difference regarding 
complications between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was very low 
due to the observational character of both studies, risk of indication bias, 
small study sizes, use of non-standardized outcome measures, and limited 
statistical analyses. The current available literature is insufficient to 
conclude whether postoperative RT after surgical stabilization should be 
standard care. It is important to realize this lack of clear evidence when 
calling upon RT as adjuvant palliative treatment.

Life expectancy has grown dramatically in modern times. This increase, however, 
is not accompanied by the same increase in healthspan. Efforts to extend 
healthspan through pharmacological agents targeting aging-related pathological 
changes are now in the spotlight of geroscience, the main idea of which is that 
delaying of aging is far more effective than preventing the particular chronic 
disorders. Currently, anti-aging pharmacology is a rapidly developing 
discipline. It is a preventive field of health care, as opposed to conventional 
medicine which focuses on treating symptoms rather than root causes of illness. 
A number of pharmacological agents targeting basic aging pathways (i.e., calorie 
restriction mimetics, autophagy inducers, senolytics etc.) are now under 
investigation. This review summarizes the literature related to advances, 
perspectives and challenges in the field of anti-aging pharmacology.

AIMS: The traditional Mediterranean diet (MD) is reportedly associated with 
lower risk of major chronic diseases and long considered to contribute to the 
reduced rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and to the highest 
life expectancy in adults who lived near the Mediterranean Sea. But despite its 
widely documented health benefits, adherence to this dietary pattern has been 
rapidly declining over the last decades due to a clear socioeconomic influence. 
The present review provides an overview of the evidence on the current major 
determinants of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with a particular emphasis 
on Mediterranean Countries at a time of economic crisis; second it explores 
emerging socioeconomic inequalities in other domains of healthy dietary 
behaviours such as dietary variety, access to organic foods and food purchasing 
behaviour.
DATA SYNTHESIS: According to ecological evidence, the Mediterranean Countries 
that used to have the highest adherence to the Mediterranean pattern in the 
Sixties, more recently experienced the greatest decrease, while Countries in 
Northern Europe and some other Countries around the world are currently 
embracing a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern. A potential cause of this 
downward trend could be the increasing prices of some food items of the 
Mediterranean diet pyramid. Recent evidence has shown a possible involvement of 
the economic crisis, material resources becoming strong determinants of the 
adherence to the MD just after the recession started in 2007-2008. Beyond 
intake, the MD also encourages increasing dietary diversity, while international 
dietary recommendations suggest replacing regular foods with healthier ones.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic factors appear to be major determinants of the 
adherence to MD and disparities also hold for other indices of diet quality

Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy 
in childhood. It is caused by mutations of the DMD gene, leading to progressive 
muscle weakness, loss of independent ambulation by early teens, and premature 
death due to cardiorespiratory complications. The diagnosis can usually be made 
after careful review of the history and examination of affected boys presenting 
with developmental delay, proximal weakness, and elevated serum creatine kinase, 
plus confirmation by muscle biopsy or genetic testing. Precise characterization 
of the DMD mutation is important for genetic counseling and individualized 
treatment. Current standard of care includes the use of corticosteroids to 
prolong ambulation and to delay the onset of secondary complications. Early use 
of cardioprotective agents, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and other 
supportive strategies has improved the life expectancy and health-related 
quality of life for many young adults with DMD. New emerging treatment includes 
viral-mediated microdystrophin gene replacement, exon skipping to restore the 
reading frame, and nonsense suppression therapy to allow translation and 
production of a modified dystrophin protein. Other potential therapeutic targets 
involve upregulation of compensatory proteins, reduction of the inflammatory 
cascade, and enhancement of muscle regeneration. So far, data from DMD clinical 
trials have shown limited success in delaying disease progression; unforeseen 
obstacles included immune response against the generated mini-dystrophin, 
inconsistent evidence of dystrophin production in muscle biopsies, and failure 
to demonstrate a significant improvement in the primary outcome measure, as 
defined by the 6-minute walk test in some studies. The long-term safety and 
efficacy of emerging treatments will depend on the selection of appropriate 
clinical end points and sensitive biomarkers to detect meaningful changes in 
disease progression. Correction of the underlying mutations using new 
gene-editing technologies and corticosteroid analogs with better safety profiles 
offers renewed hope for many individuals with DMD and their families.

BACKGROUND: Preliminary placebo-controlled evidence paved the ground to the US 
Food and Drug Administration approval extension of lisdexamfetamine for the 
treatment of moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a preliminary qualitative and quantitative synthesis of 
the placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) considering the 
efficacy and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine in the acute and/or maintenance 
treatment of moderate-to-severe BED in adults.
METHODS: A preliminary, yet comprehensive, systematic review was performed by 
accessing a broad range of resources providing publicly available data about 
lisdexamfetamine at the time of inquiry (March 2016). Study eligibility 
criteria, participants, and interventions were considered focusing on major 
clinical and functional outcomes of either efficacy or tolerability of 
lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of moderate-to-severe BED in adults.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis of data pooled from three acute RCTs significantly 
favored lisdexamfetamine over placebo in the reduction of binge eating 
days/week, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating total 
score, weight, response, and remission rates (all, P≤0.01). In contrast, 
discontinuation rates due to treatment-emergent adverse events were 
significantly higher among patients in receipt of lisdexamfetamine (relative 
risk 2.19, P=0.04) versus placebo.
LIMITATIONS: Publication, selection, performance, attrition, reporting, 
sponsorship, and "diagnostic shift" biases. Lack of inclusion of adverse event 
effects other than those requiring discontinuation of the trial(s), as well as 
lack of information about clinically relevant psychiatric or other medical 
comorbidities, limits the overall generalizability of pooled results.
CONCLUSION: Across the included acute phase RCTs, lisdexamfetamine (at 30, 50, 
or 70 mg/day) led to significant reduction in a number of clinically relevant 
outcomes compared to placebo. Moreover, safety concerns related to adverse 
events, high discontinuation rates, and the need for additional long-term 
maintenance of RCTs solicit careful monitoring of the drug in terms of overall 
safety and tolerability by further RCTs.

Breast cancer in the elderly is an increasing clinical problem. In addition, 
~60% of deaths from breast cancer occur in women aged 65 years and older. 
Despite this, older women with breast cancer have been underrepresented in 
clinical trials, and this has led to less than optimal evidence to guide their 
therapy. The management of elderly women with early breast cancer is a complex 
process that requires careful evaluation of life expectancy, comorbidities, 
patient values, and risks and benefits of available treatment options. This 
review will focus on current adjuvant systemic therapy options for older women 
with breast cancer, discuss the principles in the decision-making process, and 
define the role of endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted agents.

BACKGROUND: Over the past half century the global tendency for improvements in 
longevity has been uneven across countries. This has resulted in widening of 
inter-country disparities in life expectancy. Moreover, the pattern of 
divergence appears to be driven in part by processes at the level of country 
groupings defined in geopolitical terms. A systematic quantitative analysis of 
this phenomenon has not been possible using demographic decomposition approaches 
as these have not been suitably adapted for this purpose. In this paper we 
present an elaboration of conventional decomposition techniques to provide a 
toolkit for analysis of the inter-country variance, and illustrate its use by 
analyzing trends in life expectancy in developed countries over a 40-year 
period.
METHODS: We analyze trends in the population-weighted variance of life 
expectancy at birth across 36 developed countries and three country groups over 
the period 1970-2010. We have modified existing decomposition approaches using 
the stepwise replacement algorithm to compute age components of changes in the 
total variance as well as variance between and within groups of Established 
Market Economies (EME), Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and the Former Soviet 
Union (FSU). The method is generally applicable to the decomposition of temporal 
changes in any aggregate index based on a set of populations.
RESULTS: The divergence in life expectancy between developed countries has 
generally increased over the study period. This tendency dominated from the 
beginning of 1970s to the early 2000s, and reversed only after 2005. From 1970 
to 2010, the total standard deviation of life expectancy increased from 2.0 to 
5.6 years among men and from 1.0 to 3.6 years among women. This was determined 
by the between-group effects due to polarization between the EME and the FSU. 
The latter contrast was largely fueled by the long-term health crisis in Russia. 
With respect to age, the increase in the overall divergence was attributable to 
between-country differences in mortality changes at ages 15-64 years compared to 
those aged 65 and older. The within-group variance increased, especially among 
women. This change was mostly produced by growing mortality differences at ages 
65 and older.
CONCLUSIONS: From the early 1970s to the mid-2000s, the strong divergence in 
life expectancy across developed countries was largely determined by the 
between-group variance and mortality polarization linked to the East-West 
geopolitical division.

Cryptococcus neoformans is an important opportunistic pathogen that causes 
serious mortality and morbidity in AIDS patients. Although its incidence has 
decreased with proper antiretroviral treatment (ART), it is still a major 
concern in areas with low socioeconomic HIV endemic countries with poor sources 
of therapy. In our country, pediatric HIV infection and so, HIV-related 
opportunistic infections are very rare. In order to pay attention to this 
unusual collaboration; herein, we presented a pediatric case who was diagnosed 
with HIV and disseminated cryptococcus infection concomitantly. A 6.5-year-old 
previously healthy girl has admitted to our hospital with the complaints of 
prolonged fever, cough and hemoptysis. On her physical examination she had oral 
candidiasis, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory 
findings were as follows; white blood cell count: 3170 µL (neutrophil: 2720 µL, 
lymphocyte: 366 µL), hemoglobin level: 7.8 gr/dl, hematocrit: 25.5% platelets: 
170.000 µL, CRP: 15.2 mg/L and serum IgG level: 1865 mg/dl. Her anti-HIV test 
yielde,d positive result and confirmed by Western blot assay, together with a 
high viral load (HIV-RNA: 3.442.000 copies/ml). She was started ART (lamivudine, 
zidovudine and lopinavir/ritonavir combination) with the diagnosis of stage 3 
HIV infection (AIDS). Posteroanterior chest radiograph showed mediastinal 
extension and nodular parenchyma. Since the patient was suspected to have 
pulmonary tuberculosis based on the clinical and radiological findings, 
empirical antituberculosis therapy was started. Because of the insistance of 
fever, three different blood specimens, bone marrow and gastric aspirates were 
collected for culture, in which all of them yielded C.neoformans growth. She was 
then diagnosed as disseminated cryptococcosis and treated with liposomal 
amphotericin B and fluconazole successfully. Although pediatric HIV infection is 
usually diagnosed secondary to maternal disease, it can rarely be presented 
later in life with opportunistic infections. In the case of unusual infectious 
diseases, in addition to primary immune deficiency syndromes, HIV infection 
should also be kept in mind. Herein, we discussed a pediatric case with two rare 
infectious agents reported in our country and wanted to focus on secondary 
immune deficiency related with pediatric HIV infection.

Decision Making Among Older Adults at the End of Life: A Theoretical 
Perspective.

Understanding changes in decision making among older adults across time is 
important for health care providers. We examined how older adults with a limited 
prognosis used their perception of prognosis and health in their decision-making 
processes and related these findings to prospect theory. The theme of decision 
making in the context of ambiguity emerged, reflecting how participants used 
both prognosis and health to value choices, a behavior not fully captured by 
prospect theory. We propose an extension of the theory that can be used to 
better visualize decision making at this unique time of life among older adults.

The use of potential years of life lost for monitoring premature mortality from 
chronic diseases: Canadian perspectives.

Given that chronic diseases account for 88% of all deaths in Canada, robust 
surveillance and monitoring systems are essential for supporting implementation 
of health promotion and chronic disease prevention policies. Canada has a long 
tradition of monitoring premature mortality expressed as potential years of life 
lost (PYLL), dating back to the seminal work by Romeder and McWhinnie in the 
late 1970s, who pioneered the use of PYLL as a tool in health planning and 
decision-making. The utility of PYLL for monitoring progress was expanded in the 
1990s through the national comparable Health Indicators Initiative, following 
which PYLL has been monitored for several decades nationally, provincially, 
regionally and locally as part of health systems' performance measurement. Yet 
the potential for using PYLL in health promotion and chronic disease prevention 
has not been maximized. Linking PYLL with public health programs and initiatives 
aimed at health promotion and chronic disease prevention, introduced starting in 
the 1990s, would inform whether these efforts are making progress in addressing 
the burden of premature mortality from chronic diseases. Promoting the use of 
PYLL due to chronic diseases would contribute toward providing a more complete 
picture of chronic diseases in Canada.

Étant donné que les maladies chroniques sont à l’origine de 88% des décès au 
Canada, il est essentiel d’avoir des systèmes de surveillance et de contrôle 
robustes pour appuyer la mise en œuvre des politiques de promotion de la santé 
et de prévention des maladies chroniques. Le Canada a une longue tradition de 
surveillance de la mortalité prématurée, exprimée en années potentielles de vie 
perdues (APVP); cette tradition remonte aux travaux phares de Romeder et 
McWhinnie qui, à la fin des années 1970, ont été les pionniers de l’utilisation 
des APVP comme outil de planification sanitaire et de prise de décision. 
L’utilité des APVP pour faire le suivi des progrès réalisés s’est accrue dans 
les années 1 990 avec l’initiative nationale des Indicateurs comparables de la 
santé, depuis laquelle on suit les APVP au pays à l’échelle provinciale, 
régionale et locale lorsqu’on mesure le rendement des systèmes de santé. 
Pourtant, les possibilités d’utilisation des APVP pour la promotion de la santé 
et la prévention des maladies chroniques ne sont pas pleinement exploitées. Le 
maillage des APVP avec des programmes et initiatives de santé publique 
introduits dans les années 1990 pour promouvoir la santé et prévenir les 
maladies chroniques permettrait de savoir si ces efforts progressent vers 
l’allégement du fardeau de la mortalité prématurée due aux maladies chroniques. 
Promouvoir l’utilisation des APVP en raison des maladies chroniques 
contribuerait à dessiner un portrait plus détaillé des maladies chroniques au 
Canada.

[Current Status and Future of Lipid Examination in the Prevention and Clinical 
Treatment of Atherosclerotic Diseases--Chairmen's Introductory Remarks].

[Article in Japanese]

Yoshida H, Miida T.

Measures against atherosclerotic diseases, accounting for one-third of the 
causes of death in the Japanese population, are critical for increasing human 
healthy life expectancy. In Japan, guidelines for the prevention of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in 2012 and a dyslipidemia therapy guide 
were published by the Japan Atherosclerosis Society, and an outline of the 
clinical laboratory field, including serum lipid measurements, was also 
described in guidelines of the Japanese Society of Laboratory Medicine in 2012. 
Calculation using the Friedewald formula is recommended for LDL-cholesterol 
measurement, but the calculated LDL cholesterol values are not applicable in 
samples that are postprandial or with serum triglyceride (TG) levels of more 
than 400 mg/dL, and, if this is the case, non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol 
minus HDL cholesterol) should be evaluated. Such descriptions of LDL-cholesterol 
in these guidelines may be attributed to problems of homogenous LDL cholesterol 
assay reagents, including insufficient standardization and dispersion of LDL 
cholesterol values using a variety of reagents. Their accuracies have been 
questioned, especially in diseased subjects from the report of a joint 
U.S.-Japan study (Clin Chem 2010; 56: 977-86), and, subsequently, Miida T and 
Yoshida H et al. reported that the LDL-cholesterol homogenous assay agrees with 
the LDL cholesterol reference method (BQ) in non-diseased subjects, but exhibits 
positive bias for subjects with hypertriglyceridemia in diseased subjects with 
some reagents (Atherosclerosis 2012; 225: 208-15). Future improvements and 
advanced standardization of the LDL cholesterol homogenous assay are expected to 
greatly improve the credibility of serum lipid testing for the prevention and 
clinical treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.

The existence of multiple copies of genes is a well-known phenomenon. A gene 
family is a set of sufficiently similar genes, formed by gene duplication. In 
earlier works conducted on a limited number of completely sequenced and 
annotated genomes it was found that size of gene family and size of genome are 
positively correlated. Additionally, it was found that several atypical microbes 
deviated from the observed general trend. In this study, we reexamined these 
associations on a larger dataset consisting of 1484 prokaryotic genomes and 
using several ranking approaches. We applied ranking methods in such a way that 
genomes with lower numbers of gene copies would have lower rank. Until now only 
simple ranking methods were used; we applied the Kemeny optimal aggregation 
approach as well. Regression and correlation analysis were utilized in order to 
accurately quantify and characterize the relationships between measures of 
paralog indices and genome size. In addition, boxplot analysis was employed as a 
method for outlier detection. We found that, in general, all paralog indexes 
positively correlate with an increase of genome size. As expected, different 
groups of atypical prokaryotic genomes were found for different types of paralog 
quantities. Mycoplasmataceae and Halobacteria appeared to be among the most 
interesting candidates for further research of evolution through gene 
duplication.

BACKGROUND: Uncertainty about optimal red blood cell transfusion thresholds in 
cardiac surgery is reflected in widely varying transfusion rates between 
surgeons and cardiac centres.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a restrictive compared with a liberal 
threshold for red blood cell transfusion after cardiac surgery reduces 
post-operative morbidity and health-care costs.
DESIGN: Multicentre, parallel randomised controlled trial and within-trial 
cost-utility analysis from a UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. We 
could not blind health-care staff but tried to blind participants. Random 
allocations were generated by computer and minimised by centre and operation.
SETTING: Seventeen specialist cardiac surgery centres in UK NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged > 16 years undergoing non-emergency cardiac surgery 
with post-operative haemoglobin < 9 g/dl. Exclusion criteria were: unwilling to 
have transfusion owing to beliefs; platelet, red blood cell or clotting 
disorder; ongoing or recurrent sepsis; and critical limb ischaemia.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the liberal group were eligible for transfusion 
immediately after randomisation (post-operative haemoglobin < 9 g/dl); 
participants in the restrictive group were eligible for transfusion if their 
post-operative haemoglobin fell to < 7.5 g/dl during the index hospital stay.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite outcome of any 
serious infectious (sepsis or wound infection) or ischaemic event (permanent 
stroke, myocardial infarction, gut infarction or acute kidney injury) during the 
3 months after randomisation. Events were verified or adjudicated by blinded 
personnel. Secondary outcomes included blood products transfused; infectious 
events; ischaemic events; quality of life (European Quality of Life-5 
Dimensions); duration of intensive care or high-dependency unit stay; duration 
of hospital stay; significant pulmonary morbidity; all-cause mortality; resource 
use, costs and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: We randomised 2007 participants between 15 July 2009 and 18 February 
2013; four withdrew, leaving 1000 and 1003 in the restrictive and liberal 
groups, respectively. Transfusion rates after randomisation were 53.4% 
(534/1000) and 92.2% (925/1003). The primary outcome occurred in 35.1% (331/944) 
and 33.0% (317/962) of participants in the restrictive and liberal groups [odds 
ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.34; p = 0.30], 
respectively. There were no subgroup effects for the primary outcome, although 
some sensitivity analyses substantially altered the estimated OR. There were no 
differences for secondary clinical outcomes except for mortality, with more 
deaths in the restrictive group (4.2%, 42/1000 vs. 2.6%, 26/1003; hazard ratio 
1.64, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.67; p = 0.045). Serious post-operative complications 
excluding primary outcome events occurred in 35.7% (354/991) and 34.2% (339/991) 
of participants in the restrictive and liberal groups, respectively. The total 
cost per participant from surgery to 3 months postoperatively differed little by 
group, just £182 less (standard error £488) in the restrictive group, largely 
owing to the difference in red blood cells cost. In the base-case 
cost-effectiveness results, the point estimate suggested that the restrictive
