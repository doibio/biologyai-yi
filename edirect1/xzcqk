PURPOSE: Clinical trials have shown that the addition of aprepitant (APR) or a 
phosphorylated prodrug of aprepitant, fosaprepitant (FosAPR) as prophylactic 
antiemetic therapy consisting of a 5-hydrotryptamine-3 receptor antagonist and 
dexamethasone is effective in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. 
These combination therapies have been commonly used in Japan. In the present 
study, we performed a cost-utility analysis of APR and FosAPR in the context of 
the Japanese medical insurance system, and economic efficiency was compared.
METHODS: Data from randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of 
APR and FosAPR in the Japanese population were used. A decision tree was 
constructed to estimate the effectiveness of chemotherapy for 5 days from the 
day of the treatment and the cost associated with outpatient chemotherapy from 
the perspective of a payer. Health outcome was expressed in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and costs were estimated based on medical fees and drug 
prices from 2018. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated 
for each regimen containing either APR or FosAPR. The robustness of the model 
was assessed using 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
FINDINGS: The base-case analysis estimated that the addition of APR or FosAPR 
would have incremental effects of 0.00166 and 0.00143 QALY and incremental costs 
of 8305 and 11,348 JPY (74 and 101 USD [1 USD = 112.17 JPY]), resulting in ICERs 
of 4,992,172 and 7,955,560 JPY/QALY (44,505 and 70,924 USD/QALY), respectively. 
Sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of a complete response for 
delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting had the most influence on the 
ICERs. Reductions in the drug costs of APR and FosAPR also had an effect on the 
ICERs. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, APR and FosAPR were 
dominant in terms of cost-effectiveness in 48.7% and 8.55% of cases, 
respectively.
IMPLICATIONS: The ICER of outpatient prophylactic antiemetic therapy in patients 
receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy was calculated in the context of the 
Japanese medical insurance system. Assuming the willingness-to-pay of 5,000,000 
JPY/QALY based on the calculated ICER, our findings suggest that although the 
addition of APR is cost-effective, FosAPR is not cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in 
people with impaired glucose tolerance, but whether this leads subsequently to 
fewer complications or to increased longevity is uncertain. We aimed to assess 
the long-term effects of lifestyle interventions in people with impaired glucose 
tolerance on the incidence of diabetes, its complications, and mortality.
METHODS: The original study was a cluster randomised trial, started in 1986, in 
which 33 clinics in Da Qing, China, were randomly assigned to either be a 
control clinic or provide one of three interventions (diet, exercise, or diet 
plus exercise) for 6 years for 577 adults with impaired glucose tolerance who 
usually receive their medical care from the clinics. Subsequently, participants 
were followed for up to 30 years to assess the effects of intervention on the 
incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease events, composite microvascular 
complications, cardiovascular disease death, all-cause mortality, and life 
expectancy.
FINDINGS: Of the 577 participants, 438 were assigned to an intervention group 
and 138 to the control group (one refused baseline examination). After 30 years 
of follow-up, 540 (94%) of 576 participants were assessed for outcomes (135 in 
the control group, 405 in the intervention group). During the 30-year follow-up, 
compared with control, the combined intervention group had a median delay in 
diabetes onset of 3·96 years (95% CI 1·25 to 6·67; p=0·0042), fewer 
cardiovascular disease events (hazard ratio 0·74, 95% CI 0·59-0·92; p=0·0060), a 
lower incidence of microvascular complications (0·65, 0·45-0·95; p=0·025), fewer 
cardiovascular disease deaths (0·67, 0·48-0·94; p=0·022), fewer all-cause deaths 
(0·74, 0·61-0·89; p=0·0015), and an average increase in life expectancy of 1·44 
years (95% CI 0·20-2·68; p=0·023).
INTERPRETATION: Lifestyle intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance 
delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes and reduced the incidence of cardiovascular 
events, microvascular complications, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, 
and increased life expectancy. These findings provide strong justification to 
continue to implement and expand the use of such interventions to curb the 
global epidemic of type 2 diabetes and its consequences.

ORAI1 constitutes the store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel 
crucial for life. Whereas ORAI1 activation by Ca2+-sensing STIM proteins is 
known, still obscure is how ORAI1 is turned off through Ca2+-dependent 
inactivation (CDI), protecting against Ca2+ toxicity. Here we identify a 
spatially-restricted Ca2+/cAMP signaling crosstalk critical for mediating CDI. 
Binding of Ca2+-activated adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) to the N-terminus of ORAI1 
positions AC8 near the mouth of ORAI1 for sensing Ca2+. Ca2+ permeating ORAI1 
activates AC8 to generate cAMP and activate PKA. PKA, positioned by AKAP79 near 
ORAI1, phosphorylates serine-34 in ORAI1 pore extension to induce CDI whereas 
recruitment of the phosphatase calcineurin antagonizes the effect of PKA. 
Notably, CDI shapes ORAI1 cytosolic Ca2+ signature to determine the isoform and 
degree of NFAT activation. Thus, we uncover a mechanism of ORAI1 inactivation, 
and reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for inactivation in shaping cellular 
Ca2+ signals and NFAT activation.

Nurses are the largest workforce that impacts the health of the people. As the 
life expectancy and the number of people with chronic diseases increases in 
Asia, it is important for Asian nursing professionals to play a pivotal role in 
improving health status and quality of life by demonstrating their leadership. 
This article focuses on nursing leadership in Korea. Leadership exemplars were 
described in detail to show how successful nursing leaders set goals and 
challenged to meet these goals, despite numerous obstacles that exist in 
male-oriented society of Korea. And three essential elements that future nurse 
leaders should consider were suggested. First, awareness was emphasized as the 
first step to becoming a leader. Clear awareness about women and nursing would 
help nursing leaders reduce or eliminate gender biases that can undermine 
nurses' achievements and limit their advancement. Second, challenge was stressed 
as nursing leaders must challenge and expand the horizon of nursing by facing 
their situations and problems with courage. Lastly, transformation was 
highlighted, as the ultimate role of a leader is to make the world better. Four 
leadership frames-structural frame, human resource frame, political frame, and 
symbolic frame-were introduced to help guide their leadership journey to change 
the world. The results of this study would help nurses innovate with excellent 
leadership by efficiently managing nursing resources and by helping nursing 
organizations to adjust to changing demands in health care.

Epilepsy is a life‑threatening disorder that is marked by recurrent seizures. 
Febrile seizure is a common neurological disorder observed in neonates. In many 
cases, reducing body temperature can prevent febrile seizure. Transient receptor 
potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) is a cation channel that 
is involved in body thermoregulation. It was reported that M8‑B, a TRPM8 
antagonist, can reduce body temperature. Thus, we aimed to investigate the 
effect of M8‑B on different experimental seizure models. Eight‑day‑old male 
Wistar rat pups were used for induction of febrile seizure. M8‑B and diazepam 
were injected intraperitoneally. The rat pups were then transferred to a heated 
plexiglas chamber and the latency to the first febrile seizure was measured. In 
addition, different groups of mice were pretreated with M8‑B and received a 
convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Latencies to stages 2 and 4 and 
duration of stage 5 seizure episodes were measured. Furthermore, the effect of 
M8‑B on electroshock‑induced seizures was also investigated and hindlimb 
extension time was measured. The results showed that M8‑B decreased the body 
temperature of rat pups and increased the latency to the first febrile seizure, 
implying a significant protective effect. It also induced a significant 
anticonvulsant effect in PTZ ‑ but not electroshock‑induced convulsions. M8‑B 
showed anticonvulsant effects in both febrile‑ and PTZ‑induced seizures. M8‑B 
had a hypothermic effect with significant protective effects on febrile‑ and 
PTZ‑induced seizures; however, it did not produce similarly protective effects 
on seizures induced by electroshock.

INTRODUCTION: Racial density has not yet been explored in studies of racial 
inequalities in Brazil. Thisstudy identified categories of racial density in 
Brazilian cities and described the living and health context in these categories 
in 2000 and 2010, when demographic censuses were conducted.
METHOD: Ecological study which used skin color or race information from the last 
two censuses to calculate racial density (the ratio of people aggregated to the 
same racial group) of the Brazilian cities each year. Four categories of racial 
density (Brown; Mixed-race, predominantly black; White/Caucasian; and 
Mixed-race, predominantly white). Socioeconomic, demographic and health 
indicators were described to each category.
RESULTS: The categories of racial density captured important inequalities 
throughout the census and also indicated the continuance of worse living and 
health conditions in the cities composed by Browns and mixed-race people, 
predominantly Black; better conditions were indicated in cities where 
White/Caucasians are predominant. The cities, composed mainly of Browns and 
mixed-race people, predominantly Black, presented younger age structure, worse 
human development indexes, greater social vulnerability, income concentration, 
infant and premature mortality (<65 years) and lower life expectancy in both 
censuses, as compared to other cities.
DISCUSSION: Similarly to other countries, the racial density reflected 
inequalities in the Brazilian living and health context as well as a time lag 
among the cities.
CONCLUSION: The categories of racial density may contribute to social 
epidemiology and race relations studies in Brazil.

Publisher: INTRODUÇÃO: A densidade racial ainda não foi explorada nos estudos 
sobre desigualdades raciais no Brasil. Este estudo identifica categorias de 
densidade racial para as cidades brasileiras e descreve a situação de vida e 
saúde nessas categorias nos anos dos Censos Demográficos de 2000 e 2010.
MÉTODO: Estudo ecológico em que a informação de cor/raça nos dois últimos censos 
foi usada para calcular a densidade racial (proporçãode pessoas do mesmo grupo 
racial) nas cidades brasileiras em cada ano. Criaram-se quatro categorias de 
densidade racial (parda; mistos, mas com maioria negra; branca; e mistos, mas 
com maioria branca).Paraquais foram descritos indicadores socioeconômicos, 
demográficos e de saúde.
RESULTADOS: As categorias de densidade racial captaram desigualdades importantes 
ao longo dos censos e apontaram a permanência de piores condições de vida e 
saúde nas cidades formadas por pardos e mistos, mas com maioria negra, e 
melhores onde predominaram brancos. As cidades predominadas por pardos e mistos, 
mas com maioria negra, em relação às demais, apresentam, nos dois censos, 
estrutura etária mais jovem, piores índices de desenvolvimento humano, maior 
vulnerabilidade social, concentração de renda, mortalidade infantil e prematura 
(< 65 anos) e menor esperança de vida de seus moradores.
DISCUSSÃO: Semelhantemente a outros países, a densidade racial espelhou 
desigualdades na situação de vida e saúde no Brasil, bem como defasagem temporal 
entre suas cidades.
CONCLUSÃO: As categorias de densidade racial podem contribuir para os estudos 
sobre a epidemiologia social e sobre as relações raciais no país.

The formation of Fc-fusions, in which biologically active molecules and the Fc 
fragment of antibodies are linked to each other, is one of the most efficient 
and successful half-life extension technologies to be developed and applied to 
peptide and protein pharmaceuticals thus far. Fc-fusion compounds are generally 
produced by recombinant methods. However, these cannot be applied to artificial 
middle molecules, such as peptides with non-natural amino acids, unnatural 
cyclic peptides, or pharmaceutical oligonucleotides. Here, we developed a 
simple, efficient, semisynthetic method for Fc-fusion production involving our 
previously developed enzymatic N-terminal extension reaction (i.e., NEXT-A 
reaction) and strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition, achieving quantitative 
conversion and high selectivity for the N-terminus of the Fc protein. An 
Fc-fusion compound prepared by this method showed comparable biological activity 
to that of the original peptide and a long-circulating plasma half-life. Thus, 
the proposed method is potentially applicable for the conjugation of a wide 
range of pharmaceutical components.

AIMS: HIV predisposes patients to opportunistic infections. However, with the 
establishment of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), patients' CD4 
counts are maintained, as is a near normal life expectancy. This study aimed to 
establish the impact of HIV on the bacteriology of spondylodiscitis in a region 
in which tuberculosis (TB) is endemic, and to identify factors that might 
distinguish between them.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2015, 63 consecutive 
cases of spontaneous spondylodiscitis were identified from a single-centre, 
prospectively maintained database. Demographics, presenting symptoms, blood 
results, HIV status, bacteriology, imaging, and procedure undertaken were 
reviewed and comparisons made of TB, non-TB, and HIV groups. There were 63 
patients (22 male, 41 female) with a mean age of 42.0 years (11 to 78; sd 15.0).
RESULTS: In total, 53 patients had tuberculous, nine bacterial, and one 
cryptococcal spondylodiscitis. There were 29 HIV-positive patients, 29 
HIV-negative patients, and five patients with unknown HIV status. The local 
incidence of TB spondylodiscitis was 1.54/100 000 and that of non-TB 
spondylodiscitis was 0.29/100 000 per annum. TB patients were younger with 
similar clinical presentation and infective markers, but were more likely to 
have a paraspinal abscess. They were also less likely to have a hyperintense 
disc on MRI. There was no difference between the two HIV groups.
CONCLUSION: In areas of endemic TB and HIV, TB remains the most common cause of 
spondylodiscitis at five times the rate of non-tuberculous causes. HIV managed 
with HAART increases the rate of infection but does not influence the 
bacteriology unless there is a low CD4. There was little to differentiate the 
groups. TB /HIV co-infected patients were younger than non-TB and HIV-negative 
patients. Non-TB patients were more likely to have disc hyperintensity on MRI 
and TB patients were more likely to have abscess formation, but as both groups 
exhibited these features, neither was diagnostic. Culture confirmation remains 
necessary. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2019;101-B:617-620.

In the United States, there is an increased interest to understand the value of 
health technologies. Cost-effectiveness analysis is arguably the most 
appropriate framework to quantify value and to inform reimbursement decision 
making regarding medical interventions; however, a thorough analysis is resource 
intensive and complex. In many countries, the cost-effectiveness of medical 
interventions is evaluated by expert agencies at the national level, but in the 
United States, reimbursement decision making occurs at the local level. This 
raises the question of how we can provide a means to transparent 
cost-effectiveness analysis that reflects the local context and patient 
population and is based on the latest evidence and scientific insights. In other 
words, how can we maximize the relevance and credibility of cost-effectiveness 
evaluations in the context of a decentralized decision-making environment? 
Published cost-effectiveness analyses typically fail on these dimensions. Access 
to transparent open-source models that can be adapted to reflect the local 
setting in a relatively straightforward manner is an essential step toward such 
a goal. However, no model for cost-effectiveness analysis is ever truly "right" 
or "complete," and it must evolve along with clinical evidence and improvements 
in scientific methodology to ensure that its credibility remains. We propose a 
transparent approach of iterative development and collaboration between content 
and methodology experts to produce up-to-date, open-source consensus-based 
cost-effectiveness models that account for parameter and structural uncertainty 
to help local decision makers understand the confidence with which they might 
make a decision. Our proposed approach provides a way to adapt formal 
assessments of value-long the province of centralized health care systems-into 
the decentralized U.S. health care landscape. DISCLOSURES: This research was

family-based (FB) interventions on child weight, dietary intake, glycated 
hemoglobin, and quality of life in rural settings.
METHODS: This study was a three-armed, randomized controlled trial. Participants 
were children (age 8-12 years) with overweight or obesity and their parents. A 
FB (n = 88), a PO (n = 78) and a health education condition (HEC) (n = 83) each 
included 20 group contacts over 1 year. Assessment and treatment contacts 
occurred at Cooperative Extension Service offices. The main outcome was change 
in child body mass index z-score (BMIz) from baseline to year 2.
RESULTS: Parents in all conditions reported high treatment satisfaction (mean of 
3.5 or higher on a 4-point scale). A linear mixed model analysis of change in 
child BMIz from baseline to year 1 and year 2 found that there were no 
significant group by time differences in child BMIz (year 2 change in BMIz for 
FB = -0.03 [-0.1, 0.04], PO = -0.01 [-0.08, 0.06], and HEC = -0.09 [-0.15, 
-0.02]). While mean attendance across conditions was satisfactory during months 
1-4 (69%), it dropped during the maintenance phase (42%). High attendance for 
the PO intervention was related to greater changes in child BMIz (p < .02). 
Numerous barriers to participation were reported.
CONCLUSION: Many barriers exist that inhibit regular attendance at in-person 
contacts for many families. Innovative delivery strategies are needed that 
balance treatment intensity with feasibility and acceptability to families and 
providers to facilitate broad dissemination in underserved rural 
settings.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01820338.

Plastic is ubiquitous in modern life, but most conventional plastic is 
non-biodegradable and accumulates as waste after use. Biodegradable plastic is a 
promising alternative to conventional plastic. However, biodegradable plastics 
must be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that they undergo complete degradation 
and have no adverse impact on the environment. We evaluated the degradation of 
biodegradable plastics during 18-week full-scale composting, and determined 
whether additives from the plastics are released upon degradation. Two 
biodegradable plastic films-one containing polybutylene co-adipate 
co-terephthalate (PBAT) and the other containing polylactic 
acid/poly-hydroxy-alkanoate (PLA/PHA)-were placed into meshbags and buried in 
the compost. Degradation was assessed by image analysis, scanning electron 
microscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, electrophoretic mobility, 
δ13C isotope analyses, and single particle mass spectrometry of mulch fragments. 
The results showed >99% macroscopic degradation of PLA/PHA and 97% for PBAT 
film. Polymers in the biodegradable films degraded; however, micro- and 
nanoparticles, most likely carbon black, were observed on the meshbags. Overall, 
biodegradable plastics hold promise, but the release of micro- and nanoparticles 
from biodegradable plastic upon degradation warrants additional investigation 
and calls for longer field testing to ensure that either complete biodegradation 
occurs or that no long-term harm to the environment is caused.

Protein and calorie restrictions extend median lifespan in many organisms. 
However, studies suggest that among-individual variation in the age at death is 
also affected. Ultimately, both of these outcomes must be caused by effects of 
nutrition on underlying patterns of age-specific mortality (ASM). Using model 
life tables, we tested for effects of dietary macronutrients on ASM in mice ( 
Mus musculus). High concentrations of protein and fat relative to carbohydrates 
were associated with low life expectancy and high variation in the age at death, 
a result caused predominantly by high mortality prior to middle age. A lifelong 
diet comprising the ratio of macronutrients self-selected by mouse (in early 
adulthood) was associated with low mortality up until middle age, but higher 
late-life mortality. This pattern results in reasonably high life expectancy, 
but very low variation in the age at death. Our analyses also indicate that it 
may be possible to minimize ASM across life by altering the ratio of dietary 
protein to carbohydrate in the approach to old age. Mortality in early and 
middle life was minimized at around one-part protein to two-parts carbohydrate, 
whereas in later life slightly greater than equal parts protein to carbohydrate 
reduced mortality.

BACKGROUND: Health related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important predictor of 
clinical outcomes for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients and to establish 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for economic evaluation studies. This study 
aims to measure the health utilities and to identify socio-demographic and 
clinical factors associated with HRQOL for haemodialysis (HD) and continuous 
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in Malaysia.
METHODS: A total of 141 patients (77 HD and 64 CAPD) from 1 federal and four 
state hospitals participated in this cross-sectional study. Patients were 
randomly selected from the National Renal Registry (NRR) using a stratified 
random sampling. The EQ-5D-3 L questionnaire was used to measure HRQOL. 
Variables investigated include dialysis modalities, sociodemographic 
characteristics, co-morbidities and biochemical markers. Utilities are measured 
on an ordinal scale of 0-1, where 1 indicates full health and 0 indicates death.
RESULTS: The mean utility scores were 0.854 ± 0.181 and 0.905 ± 0.124 (p > 0.05) 
and the mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores were 76.2 ± 12.90 and 
77.1 ± 10.26 (p > 0.05) for HD and CAPD patients respectively. There was a 
significant difference in problems reported between HD (35.1%) and CAPD (15.6%) 
on usual activities dimension (p = 0.009). The proportion of patients having 
problems in the pain/discomfort domain in both modalities was high (34.0%). 
Haemoglobin (< 10 g/dL) (p = 0.003), number of co-morbidities ≥3 (p = 0.004) and 
wheelchair-bound status (p < 0.001) were significant predictors of poor HRQOL.
CONCLUSIONS: The present cross-sectional study shows that CAPD patients have a 
higher utility index score than HD patients but this was not statistically 
significant. The utilities index score may be used to calculate QALYs.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic impact of the current measles vaccination 
program in Zhejiang Province, east China.
METHODS: A decision tree-Markov model with parameters from published 
literatures, government documents and surveys was developed and used to simulate 
over 40 years of a birth cohort in Zhejiang Province during the year 2014. The 
expected cost and effectiveness of the current measles vaccination program was 
compared against no vaccination. Costs were assessed from the payer's 
perspective. Benefits were defined as savings on the direct cost of measles 
treatment, and the effectiveness was measured according to the number of measles 
cases and deaths averted. The net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR) 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were also calculated. A 
threshold for cost-effectiveness of less than 3 times the Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) per capita was used. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess 
parameter uncertainties.
RESULTS: The total vaccination cost was estimated to be $2.52 million. The BCR 
of the current measles program was found to be 6.06 with a NPV of $73.38 
million. It was also calculated that a total of 195,165 measles cases and 191 
measles-related deaths would be prevented by vaccination. The ICER was 
approximately $12.91 per case averted and $13,213.43 per death averted, 
respectively, which was cost-effective. The models were proven to be robust.
CONCLUSIONS: The current measles vaccination program appeared to be 
cost-effective and to offer substantial benefits. The results of this analysis 
sought to contribute to the justification of future investments to achieve the 
goal of measles elimination.

Binding of Staphylococcus aureus to the large plasma glycoprotein von Willebrand 
factor (vWF) is controlled by hydrodynamic flow conditions. Currently, we know 
little about the molecular details of this shear-stress-dependent interaction. 
Using single-molecule atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that vWF binds to 
the S. aureus surface protein A (SpA) via a previously undescribed 
force-sensitive mechanism. We identify an extremely strong SpA-vWF interaction, 
capable of withstanding forces of ∼2 nN, both in laboratory and in clinically 
relevant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. Strong bonds are 
activated by mechanical stress, consistent with flow experiments revealing that 
bacteria adhere in larger amounts to vWF surfaces when the shear rate is 
increased. We suggest that force-enhanced adhesion may involve conformational 
changes in vWF. Under force, elongation of vWF may lead to the exposure of a 
high-affinity cryptic SpA-binding site to which bacteria firmly attach. In 
addition, force-induced structural changes in the SpA domains may also promote 
strong, high-affinity binding. This force-regulated interaction might be of 
medical importance as it may play a role in bacterial adherence to platelets and 
to damaged blood vessels.IMPORTANCEStaphylococcus aureus protein A (SpA) binds 
to von Willebrand factor (vWF) under flow. While vWF binding to SpA plays a role 
in S. aureus adherence to platelets and endothelial cells under shear stress, 
the molecular basis of this stress-dependent interaction has not yet been 
elucidated. Here we show that the SpA-vWF interaction is regulated by a new 
force-dependent mechanism. The results suggest that mechanical extension of vWF 
may lead to the exposure of a high-affinity cryptic SpA-binding site, consistent 
with the shear force-controlled functions of vWF. Moreover, strong binding may 
be promoted by force-induced structural changes in the SpA domains. This study 
highlights the role of mechanoregulation in controlling the adhesion of S. 
aureus and shows promise for the design of small inhibitors capable of blocking 
colonization under high shear stress.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer prognosis varies substantially with socioeconomic 
status. We investigated differences in life expectancy between socioeconomic 
groups and estimated the potential gain in life-years if cancer-related survival 
differences could be eliminated.
METHODS: This population-based study included 470,000 individuals diagnosed with 
colon and rectal cancers between 1998 and 2013 in England. Using flexible 
parametric survival models, we obtained a range of life expectancy measures by 
deprivation status. The number of life-years that could be gained if differences 
in cancer-related survival between the least and most deprived groups were 
removed was also estimated.
RESULTS: We observed up to 10% points differences in 5-year relative survival 
between the least and most deprived. If these differences had been eliminated 
for colon and rectal cancers diagnosed in 2013 then almost 8231 and 7295 
life-years would have been gained respectively. This results for instance in 
more than 1-year gain for each colon cancer male patient in the most deprived 
group on average. Cancer-related differences are more profound earlier on, as 
conditioning on 1-year survival the main reason for socioeconomic differences 
were factors other than cancer.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of policies to eliminate 
socioeconomic differences in cancer survival as in this way many life-years 
could be gained.

Axons in the central nervous system (CNS) typically fail to regenerate after 
injury. This failure is multi-factorial and caused in part by disruption of the 
axonal cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton, in particular microtubules (MT), plays a 
critical role in axonal transport and axon growth during development. In this 
regard, members of the kinesin superfamily of proteins (KIFs) regulate the 
extension of primary axons toward their targets and control the growth of 
collateral branches. KIF2A negatively regulates axon growth through MT 
depolymerization. Using three different injury models to induce SCI in adult 
rats, we examined the temporal and cellular expression of KIF2A in the injured 
spinal cord. We observed a progressive increase of KIF2A expression with maximal 
levels at 10 days to 8 weeks post-injury as determined by Western blot analysis. 
KIF2A immunoreactivity was present in axons, spinal neurons and mature 
oligodendrocytes adjacent to the injury site. Results from the present study 
suggest that KIF2A at the injured axonal tips may contribute to neurite 
outgrowth inhibition after injury, and that its increased expression in 
inhibitory spinal neurons adjacent to the injury site might contribute to an 
intrinsic wiring-control mechanism associated with neuropathic pain. Further 
studies will determine whether KIF2A may be a potential target for the 
development of regeneration-promoting or pain-preventing therapies.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS102), a novel oral cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo in 
heavily pretreated advanced gastric cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of TAS102 in the third-line or later treatment for this 
population from the US payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate advanced gastric cancer, 
including three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive 
disease (PD) and death. Model inputs were derived from a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (TAGS trial, NCT02500043). 
Utilities were extracted from public resources. Costs were calculated from an 
American payer perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the 
impact of uncertainty.
RESULTS: From the US payer perspective, treatment with TAS102 for patients with 
heavily pretreated advanced gastric cancer was estimated to increase costs by 
$59,180 compared with the placebo, with a gain of 0.06 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $986,333 per 
QALY. The costs for progression-free survival of TAS102 group had the greatest 
impact on the ICERs, as well as the cost of TAS102.
CONCLUSION: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS102) is not a cost-effective choice for 
patients with heavily pretreated metastatic gastric cancer from an American 
payer perspective.

BACKGROUND: The iDSI reference case, originally published in 2014, aims to 
improve the quality and comparability of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA). This 
study assesses whether the development of the guideline is associated with an 
improvement in methodological and reporting practices for CEAs using 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
METHODS: We analyzed the Tufts Medical Center Global Health CEA Registry to 
identify cost-per-DALY averted studies published from 2011 to 2017. Among each 
of 11 principles in the iDSI reference case, we translated all methodological 
specifications and reporting standards into a series of binary questions 
(satisfied or not satisfied) and awarded articles one point for each item 
satisfied. We then calculated methodological and reporting adherence scores 
separately as a percentage of total possible points, measured as normalized 
adherence score (0% = no adherence; 100% = full adherence). Using the year 2014 
as the dissemination period, we conducted a pre-post analysis. We also conducted 
sensitivity analyses using: 1) optional criteria in scoring, 2) alternate
