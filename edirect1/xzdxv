INTRODUCTION: Survival from type 1 diabetes Mellitus is low in lower-income 
countries with underdeveloped health systems. Support programs from partners 
like life for a child (LFAC) and changing diabetes in children (CDiC) were 
implemented in Tanzania in 2005 to provide diabetes care to children and youth. 
No evaluation of survival has been done since their implementation.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the survival of children and youth living with diabetes 
mellitus (CYLDM) in Tanzania.
METHODS: A retrospective data collection from 39 clinics of CYLDM was done by 
extracting data from the diabetes registry between 1991 and 2019. Three cohort 
were analyzed (1) Cohort 1991-2004 (pre-implementation), (2) Cohort 2005-2010 
(during implementation), and (3) 2011-2019 (after the implementation of 
LFAC/CDiC). Data were analyzed using STATA-version 14.
RESULTS: A total of 3822 data of CYLDM were extracted, mean age at diagnosis was 
13.8 (±5) years. Approximately fifty-one percent (50.8%) were male. The total 
observation time was 28 years, and the Median duration of diabetes of 5 (IQR2, 
8) years. Total death was 95 (3%), with a mean age at death of 17.7 (SD 4.7) 
years. The last cohort (2011-2019) had more diagnosis 2353 (72.7%), as compared 
to the <2005 cohort with only 163(5%). The survival improved from 59% before 
2005 to 69% in the last cohort (2011-2019).
CONCLUSION: The implemented programs have facilitated the diagnosis and 
retention of CYLDM in the health care system. In doing so, it has also increased 
the survival probability in Tanzania compared to the early 90s.

BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS is now a chronic disease, as adherence to anti-retrovirals 
impacts positively on the quality as well as expectancy of life. However, there 
exist multifaceted barriers to treatments for which children are most 
disadvantaged. Since Ghana subscribed to the "treat all" policy less percentage 
(25.5%) of children (2-14 years) living with HIV/AIDS have been enrolled on the 
antiretroviral program compared to other categories of the population by 2019. 
At present no study has explored these barriers to children living with HIV/AIDS 
enrollment and adherence. This study aims to explore the perceived barriers of 
caregivers of children living with HIV/AIDS in the Tamale Metropolis.
METHODS: We used descriptive phenomenology to explore the phenomena. Caregivers 
were purposively selected and interviewed till information became repetitive at 
the ninth (9th) caregiver. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect 
data through face-to-face in-depth interviews which were audio recorded. The 
interviews lasted an average of 47 minutes. Audio interviews were transcribed 
verbatim (English) and translated back-to-back (Daghani) before analysis was 
done manually according to Collaizi's seven-step approach. We used the Guba and 
Lincoln guidelines to ensure the rigour of the study and its findings. Results 
are presented in themes and supported with quotes.
RESULTS: Six themes emerged from the analysis of the caregivers' transcripts; 
(1) denial of HIV/AID diagnosis, (2) stock-outs and privacy at the clinic, (3) 
busy schedule and poor support, (4) ignorance and alternative herbal cure, (5) 
stigma and discrimination, (6) transportation and distance.
CONCLUSION: Perceived barriers are multi-dimensional and encountered by all 
PLWHA, especially children. These barriers could derail the gains of HIV/AIDS 
interventions among children. Adherence counselling among caregivers alongside 
campaigns among faith and herbal healers are of grave concern to reduce myths of 
cure.

University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China keythera@126.com.

OBJECTIVE: Camrelizumab is a selective, humanised, high-affinity IgG4 kappa 
monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death 1 that shows effective 
antitumour activity with acceptable toxicity in multiple tumour types. The CameL 
trial demonstrated that camrelizumab plus chemotherapy (CC) significantly 
prolonged the median progression-free survival and median overall survival 
versus chemotherapy alone (CA) in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our study was conducted to investigate the 
cost-effectiveness of the two strategies in chemotherapy-naive patients with 
advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov simulation model was generated based 
on the CameL trial. The two simulated treatments included CC and CA.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Utility was derived from published 
literature, and costs were calculated based on those at our hospital in Chengdu, 
China. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to compare 
the cost-effectiveness of the two treatment arms.
RESULTS: In the overall population, the total costs were $27 223.40 and 
$13 740.10 for CC and CA treatment, respectively. The CC treatment produced 1.37 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the CA treatment produced 1.17 QALYs. 
Hence, patients who were in the CC group spent an additional $13 483.30 and 
generated an increase of 0.20 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $67 416.50 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: For chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC, 
CC is not considered a cost-effective treatment versus CA in China when 
considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of $31 500 per QALY.

OBJECTIVE: To test the validity and reliability of the Chichewa Wijma Delivery 
Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) in Malawian postpartum women.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of postnatal women (N= 415) at 1 day after 
vaginal birth was conducted at a district hospital in Malawi. The W-DEQ, 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the World Health Organization Quality 
of Life Scale were used to measure fear of birth (FOB), depressive symptoms and 
quality of life (QoL). Principal component analysis (PCA) and confirmatory 
factor analysis (CFA), Cronbach's alpha, the average variance extracted (AVE) 
and the composite reliability (CR) and Pearson correlation were used to test the 
construct validity, reliability, convergent and divergent validity of the 
Chichewa W-DEQ (CW-DEQ).
RESULTS: The participants had a mean age of 28.3 ± 6.7 years. A multidimensional 
structure containing three factors - a lack of positive feelings, fear and 
concerns about childbirth - with an appropriate model fit was reported for the 
CW-DEQ version. The Cronbach's α of the CW-DEQ was 0.87. The AVE and CR values 
were highly acceptable in lack of positive feelings - 0.17 (0.68), and concerns 
about childbirth - 0.79 (0.88) factors which proved the convergent validity of 
each; however, was marginally acceptable in the fear factor - 0.14 (0.53). Low 
range of correlations between the CW-DEQ constructs (r = 0.27 ∼ 0.42, p < .001), 
confirmed the divergent validity.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found the CW-DEQ to be a reliable and valid tool 
for assessing FOB in postpartum women.

BACKGROUND: The rate of improvement in mortality slowed across many high-income 
countries after 2010. Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, macroeconomic 
policy was dominated by austerity as countries attempted to address perceived 
problems of growing state debt and government budget deficits. This study 
estimates the impact of austerity on mortality trends for 37 high-income 
countries between 2000 and 2019.
METHODS: We fitted a suite of fixed-effects panel regression models to mortality 
data (period life expectancy, age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), 
age-stratified mortality rates and lifespan variation). Austerity was measured 
using the Alesina-Ardagna Fiscal Index (AAFI), Cyclically-Adjusted Primary 
Balance (CAPB), real indexed Government Expenditure, and Public Social Spending 
as a % of GDP. Sensitivity analyses varied the lag times, and confined the panel 
to economic downturns and to non-oil-dominated economies.
RESULTS: Slower improvements, or deteriorations, in life expectancy and 
mortality trends were seen in the majority of countries, with the worst trends 
in England & Wales, Estonia, Iceland, Scotland, Slovenia, and the USA, with 
generally worse trends for females than males. Austerity was implemented across 
all countries for at least some time when measured by AAFI and CAPB, and for 
many countries across all four measures (and particularly after 2010). Austerity 
adversely impacted life expectancy, ASMR, age-specific mortality and lifespan 
variation trends when measured with Government Expenditure, Public Social 
Spending and CAPB, but not with AAFI. However, when the dataset was restricted 
to periods of economic downturn and in economies not dominated hydrocarbon 
production, all measures of austerity were found to reduce the rate of mortality 
improvement.
INTERPRETATION: Stalled mortality trends and austerity are widespread phenomena 
across high-income countries. Austerity is likely to be a cause of stalled 
mortality trends. Governments should consider alternative economic policy 
approaches if these harmful population health impacts are to be avoided.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in worldwide kidney 
transplantation (KT) moratoriums. The impacts of these moratoriums on the life 
expectancy of KT candidates remain unclear.
METHODS: We simulated the evolution of several French candidate populations for 
KT using a multistate semi-Markovian approach and according to moratorium 
durations ranging from 0 to 24 mo. The transition rates were modeled from the 
63 927 French patients who began dialysis or were registered on the waiting list 
for KT between 2011 and 2019.
RESULTS: Among the 8350 patients active on the waiting list at the time of the 
French KT moratorium decided on March 16, 2020, for 2.5 mo, we predicted 4.0 
additional months (confidence interval [CI], 2.8-5.0) on the waiting list and 42 
additional deaths (CI, -70 to 150) up to March 16, 2030, compared with the 
scenario without moratorium. In this population, we reported a significant 
impact for a 9-mo moratorium duration: 135 attributable deaths (CI, 31-257) up 
to March 16, 2030. Patients who became active on the list after March 2020 were 
less impacted; there was a significant impact for an 18-mo moratorium (175 
additional deaths [CI, 21-359]) in the 10 862 prevalent end-stage renal disease 
patients on March 16, 2020 and for a 24-mo moratorium (189 additional deaths 
[CI, 10-367]) in the 16 355 incident end-stage renal disease patients after this 
date.
CONCLUSION: The temporary moratorium of KT during a COVID-19 peak represents a 
sustainable decision to free up hospitals' resources if the moratorium does not 
exceed a prolonged period.

This study is a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of fracture liaison 
services (FLS) in China, suggesting that FLS could potentially lead to lifetime 
cost-saving in patients who have experienced a fracture. However, 
Chinese-specific real-world data is needed to confirm the results of our study.
PURPOSE: The study aimed to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of fracture 
liaison services (FLS) from the Chinese healthcare perspective with a lifetime 
horizon.
METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adapted to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of FLS compared to no-FLS. The evaluation was 
conducted in patients aged 65 years with a recent fracture. Treatment pathways 
were differentiated by gender, FLS attendance, osteoporosis diagnosis, treatment 
initiation, and adherence. Given the uncertainty in FLS cost, the cost in the 
base-case analysis was assumed at US$200. Analyses were also performed to 
determine the maximum cost for making the FLS cost-saving and cost-effective at 
the Chinese willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. One-way sensitivity analyses 
were conducted.
RESULTS: When compared with no-FLS, the FLS was dominant (lower costs, higher 
quality-adjusted life years) in our target population at the FLS cost of US$200 
per patient. For every 100 patients who were admitted to the FLS, approximately 
four hip fractures, nine clinical vertebral fractures, and three wrist fractures 
would be avoided over their lifetimes. Our findings were robust to numerous 
one-way sensitivity analyses; however, the FLS was not cost-effective in 
patients aged 80 years and older.
CONCLUSION: FLS could potentially lead to lifetime cost-saving in patients who 
have experienced a fracture. Our study informs the potential cost-effectiveness 
of FLS and the knowledge gap in China; more future research incorporating 
Chinese-specific real-world data are needed to confirm the results of our study 
and to better evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FLS in China.

AIM: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of 
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We investigated 
associations of EAT with proteomics, coronary flow reserve (CFR), cardiac 
structure and function, and quality of life (QoL) in the prospective 
multinational PROMIS-HFpEF cohort.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Epicardial adipose tissue was measured by echocardiography 
in 182 patients and defined as increased if ≥9 mm. Proteins were measured using 
high-throughput proximity extension assays. Microvascular dysfunction was 
evaluated with Doppler-based CFR, cardiac structural and functional indices with 
echocardiography and QoL by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). 
Patients with increased EAT (n = 54; 30%) had higher body mass index (32 [28-40] 
vs. 27 [23-30] kg/m2 ; p < 0.001), lower N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide (466 [193-1133] vs. 1120 [494-1990] pg/ml; p < 0.001), smaller indexed 
left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and left atrial (LA) volumes and tendency to 
lower KCCQ score. Non-indexed LV/LA volumes did not differ between groups. When 
adjusted for body mass index, EAT remained associated with LV septal wall 
thickness (coefficient 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.04; p = 0.018) 
and mitral E wave deceleration time (coefficient 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05; 
p = 0.005). Increased EAT was associated with proteomic markers of adipose 
biology and inflammation, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and 
dyslipidaemia but not significantly with CFR.
CONCLUSION: Increased EAT was associated with cardiac structural alterations and 
proteins expressing adiposity, inflammation, lower insulin sensitivity and 
endothelial dysfunction related to HFpEF pathology, probably driven by general 
obesity. Potential local mechanical or paracrine effects mediated by EAT remain 
to be elucidated.

The control of infectious diseases has always been a top medical priority. For 
years during the so-called antibiotic era, we enjoyed prolonged life expectancy 
and the benefits of superior pathogen control. The devastating failure of the 
medical system, agriculture and pharmaceutical companies and the general 
population to appreciate and safeguard these benefits is now leading us into a 
grim post-antibiotic era. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to 
microorganisms becoming resistant to antibiotics that were designed and expected 
to kill them. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, AMR was recognised by the World 
Health Organization as the central priority area with growing public awareness 
of the threat AMR now presents. The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, a 
project commissioned by the UK government, predicted that the death toll of AMR 
could be one person every 3 seconds, amounting to 10 million deaths per year by 
2050. This review aims to raise awareness of the evergrowing extensiveness of 
antimicrobial resistance and identify major sources of this adversity, focusing 
on agriculture's role in this problem and its solutions. KEYPOINTS: • Widespread 
development of antibiotic resistance is a major global health risk. • Antibiotic 
resistance is abundant in agricultural produce, soil, food, water, air and 
probiotics. • New approaches are being developed to control and reduce 
antimicrobial resistance.

Purpose: Recent studies in economics showed that humans are bounded rational. 
This being consumers, they are not perfect judges of what matters for the 
standard of living. While with a marked increase in economic and social 
wellbeing, there is a consistent rise in obesity levels, especially in the 
developed world. Thus, this study intends to explore the empirical and 
socio-economic antecedents of human obesity across countries using six global 
indexes. Methods: This study used the data of 40 countries between 1975 to 2018 
and used the Panel FGLS Regression with the quadratic specification. Findings: 
The results showed that health and food indicators increase global human 
obesity, environment and education indicators decrease global human obesity, and 
economic and social indicators follow an inverted U-shaped pattern in affecting 
global human obesity. Originality: Previous studies have used infant mortality 
and life expectancy as the major health indicator in determining the standard of 
living while overlooking global human obesity as a major deterrent to welfare. 
This study has provided a holistic assessment of the causes of obesity in global 
contexts.

[Management of fertility and pregnancy in patients with chronic myeloid 
leukemia].

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as treatment for patients 
with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has dramatically improved the outcomes. The 
life expectancy of patients with CML is now comparable to that of the general 
population. Although the median age of onset of CML is around 60 years, it can 
also occur in children, adolescents, and young adults. The excellent disease 
control gives young patients a hope of childbearing. However, TKIs may have 
teratogenic potentials in the issue of fertility and pregnancy. One possible 
scenario is to discontinue TKI treatment for conception and pregnancy because 
treatment-free remission (TFR) is a realistic option for patients with CML in 
sustained deep molecular remission. Conversely, pregnancy occurs in patients who 
are ineligible for TFR or who have active CML. Therefore, several treatment 
strategies should be prepared from the viewpoint of the situation of pregnancy 
in patients with CML.

INTRODUCTION: Aging is a phenomenon that has increased worldwide as a result of 
a higher life expectancy, evidencing situations typical of this stage, which can 
impact the happiness of individuals, who deserve attention and approach from 
mental health and public health.
OBJECTIVE: to explore the association between sociodemographic characteristics, 
medical history and symptoms, emotional state, social support, cognitive 
performance, and functional dependence, in relation to happiness in older adults 
in a rural area of Túquerres, Nariño.
METHOD: cross-sectional study of association. Results: There were 252 records in 
total, corresponding to the data of rural older adults. A multivariate linear 
regression was performed, ﬁnding an association with happiness in the variables 
of age (βa = .41; CI95% .09 - .73), socioeconomic level (βa = -.22; CI95% -.58 - 
.13), education level (βa = .41; CI95% .68 - 1.49), occupation (βa = .59; CI95% 
-.48 - 1.67), having chronic disease (βa = .42; CI95% .12 - .73), breathing 
diﬃculties (βa = -.25; CI95% -.51 - .02), joint pain (βa = .55; CI95% .26 - 
.83), depression symptoms (βa = -.21; CI95% -.48 - .06]) or anxiety (βa = .40; 
CI95% .72 - .07), and social support (βa = -.27; CI95% -.52 - -.02).
DISCUSSION: this population has unfavorable socioeconomic and health conditions 
that impact their perception of happiness. Conclusion: happiness is a 
multicausal phenomenon that in older adults is part of the result of the 
interaction of variables and historical decisions at a political, economic, and 
social level.

Introduction: Mild cognitive impairments (MCI) accompanying aging are associated 
with oxidative stress. The ability of cells to respond to stress is determined 
by the protein synthesis level, which depends on the ribosomes number. Ribosomal 
deficit was documented in MCI. The number of ribosomes depends, together with 
other factors, on the number of ribosomal genes copies. We hypothesized that MCI 
is associated with low rDNA CN in the elderly person genome. Materials and 
Methods: rDNA CN and the telomere repeat (TR) content were determined in the DNA 
of peripheral blood leukocytes of 93 elderly people (61-91 years old) with MCI 
and 365 healthy volunteers (16-91 years old). The method of non-radioactive 
quantitative hybridization of DNA with biotinylated DNA probes was used for the 
analysis. Results: In the MCI group, rDNA CN (mean 329 ± 60; median 314 copies, 
n = 93) was significantly reduced (p < 10-15) compared to controls of the same 
age with preserved cognitive functions (mean 412 ± 79; median 401 copies, n = 
168) and younger (16-60 years) control group (mean 426 ± 109; median 416 copies, 
n = 197). MCI is also associated with a decrease in TR DNA content. There is no 
correlation between the content of rDNA and TR in DNA, however, in the group of 
DNA samples with rDNA CN > 540, TR content range was significantly narrowed 
compared to the rest of the sample. Conclusion: Mild cognitive impairment is 
associated with low ribosomal genes copies in the elderly people genomes. A low 
level of rDNA CN may be one of the causes of ribosomal deficit that was 
documented in MCI. The potential possibilities of using the rDNA CN indicator as 
a prognostic marker characterizing human life expectancy are discussed.

Recently, a dramatic increase in the average life expectancy has been noted, 
regarded as the one of the greatest achievements of the last decades, but in 
consequence osteoporosis affects millions of people all over the world. 
Currently osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder characterized by 
compromised bone strength which leads to an increased risk of fractures. The 
most commonly used tool to evaluate the 10-year risk of fractures is the 
fracture risk assessment tool validated in many independent cohorts. 
Osteoporosis itself has no symptoms, but fractures are common symptoms of 
osteoporosis which can result in disability and mortality. Hence, osteoporosis 
is called a silent epidemic as well as a silent killer. The best way to assess 
patients with osteoporosis is by using the most widely employed techniques - 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or quantitative computed tomography. There are 
a lot of precisely documented risk factors of osteoporosis - e.g. cigarette 
smoking, alcohol use, getting little or no exercise, being small-framed or thin, 
a diet low in foods containing calcium and vitamin D - and their limitation or 
elimination is the best way for prophylactics of this dangerous disease. Some 
other risk factors such as age and sex of patients should not be omitted in the 
decision making process. In the literature there are numerous therapeutic 
proposals and different guidelines. In this review we present the recent 
advances in the prophylactics and treatment of osteoporosis.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among women worldwide and more 
than half are diagnosed above the age of 60 years. Life expectancy is increasing 
and the number of breast cancer cases diagnosed among older women are expected 
to increase. Undertreatment, mostly due to unjustifiable fears of advanced-age 
and associated comorbidities, is commonly practiced in this group of patients 
who are under-represented in clinical trials and their management is not 
properly addressed in clinical practice guidelines. With modern surgery and 
anesthesia, breast surgeries are considered safe and is usually associated with 
very low complication rates, regardless of extent of surgery. However, 
oncoplastic surgery and management of the axilla can be tailored based on 
patients'- and disease-related factors. Most of chemotherapeutic agents, along 
with targeted therapy and anti-Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) 
drugs can be safely given for older patients, however, dose adjustment and close 
monitoring of potential adverse events might be needed. The recently introduced 
cyclin-D kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitors in combination with aromatase inhibitors 
(AI) or fulvestrant, which changed the landscape of breast cancer therapy, are 
both safe and effective in older patients and had substituted more aggressive 
and potentially toxic interventions. Despite its proven efficacy, adjusting or 
even omitting adjuvant radiation therapy, at least in low-risk older patients, 
is safe and frequently practiced. In this paper, we review existing data related 
to breast cancer management among older patients across the continuum; from 
resection of the primary tumor through adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation and 
endocrine therapy up to the management of recurrent and advanced-stage disease.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder 
characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta (SNc). The pathogenesis of PD is strongly related to 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. This 
indicates that PD can be treated with anti-oxidative substitutes and 
anti-inflammatory compounds. The neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects 
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) agonists decrease cell 
death and halt the increase in neurodegeneration, which is why they have been 
given a lot of importance in research. Antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory 
effects have been observed to be generated by pioglitazone (PG), a selective 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) agonist that regulates 
neural plasticity in various neurodegenerative disorders. The neuroprotective 
and anti-inflammatory effects of PG are assessed in this article. It was found 
that the patients with DM who received PG treatment were noticeably at a lower 
risk of PD. However, some clinical studies have not proven a strong link between 
the therapeutic effects of PG on PD. As per suggestions of preclinical studies, 
the therapeutic effects of PG treatment include; increased life expectancy of 
neurons, decreased oxidative stress, halted microglial activity, lower 
inflammation (reduced NF-κB, COX-2, and iNOS), reduced mitochondrial 
dysfunction, rise in motor function (motor agility) and non-motor function 
(lowered cognitive dysfunction). In conclusion, we determined that PG exerts 
neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in PD models and it can be 
considered a potential therapeutic candidate for PD.

OBJECTIVES: Many plant-derived anti-aging preparations influence antioxidant 
defense system. Consumption of food supplemented with chili pepper powder was 
found to extend lifespan in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The present 
study aimed to test a connection between life-extending effect of chili powder 
and antioxidant defense system of D. melanogaster.
METHODS: Flies were reared for 15 days in the mortality cages on food with 0% 
(control), 0.04%, 0.12%, 0.4%, or 3% chili powder. Antioxidant and related 
enzymes, as well as oxidative stress indices were measured.
RESULTS: Female flies that consumed chili-supplemented food had a 40-60% lower 
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity as compared with the control cohort. 
Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was about 37% higher in males that 
consumed food with 3% chili powder in comparison with the control cohort. Many 
of the parameters studied were sex-dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of chili-supplemented food extends lifespan in fruit 
fly cohorts in a concentration- and gender-dependent manner. However, this 
extension is not mediated by a strengthening of antioxidant defenses. 
Consumption of chili-supplemented food does not change the specific relationship 
between antioxidant and related enzymes in D. melanogaster, and does not change 
the linkage of the activities of these enzymes to fly gender.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Most guidelines in the UK, Europe and North America do 
not recommend organised population-wide screening for prostate cancer. 
Prostate-specific antigen-based screening can reduce prostate cancer-specific 
mortality, but there are concerns about overdiagnosis, overtreatment and 
economic value. The aim was therefore to assess the cost effectiveness of eight 
potential screening strategies in the UK.
METHODS: We used a cost-utility analysis with an individual-based simulation 
model. The model was calibrated to data from the 10-year follow-up of the 
Cluster Randomised Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP). Treatment 
effects were modelled using data from the Prostate Testing for Cancer and 
Treatment (ProtecT) trial. The participants were a hypothetical population of 10 
million men in the UK followed from age 30 years to death. The strategies were: 
no screening; five age-based screening strategies; adaptive screening, where men 
with an initial prostate-specific antigen level of < 1.5 ng/mL are screened 
every 6 years and those above this level are screened every 4 years; and two 
polygenic risk-stratified screening strategies. We assumed the use of pre-biopsy 
multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging for men with prostate-specific 
antigen ≥ 3 ng/mL and combined transrectal ultrasound-guided and targeted 
biopsies. The main outcome measures were projected lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years from a National Health Service perspective.
RESULTS: All screening strategies increased costs compared with no screening, 
with the majority also increasing quality-adjusted life-years. At 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20,000 or £30,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained, a once-off screening at age 50 years was optimal, although 
this was sensitive to the utility estimates used. Although the polygenic 
risk-stratified screening strategies were not on the cost-effectiveness 
frontier, there was evidence to suggest that they were less cost ineffective 
than the alternative age-based strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the prostate-specific antigen-based strategies compared, only a 
once-off screening at age 50 years was potentially cost effective at current UK 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. An additional follow-up of CAP to 15 years may 
reduce uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of the screening strategies.

School of Medicine, Mineola, NY.

Occlusive disease of the iliac veins or major intrathoracic veins have 
traditionally been managed by conservative management or by major vascular 
reconstructive procedures. Over the past 15-20 years, these lesions have become 
amenable to management with venous stents. Lesions in the iliac venous system 
are typically due to thrombus secondary to deep vein thrombosis, and lesions in 
the superior vena cava are due to either malignant intrathoracic lesions, 
indwelling central venous catheters, pacemaker leads, or enlarged nodes due to 
granulomatous disease. The success rate for implantation is between 92% and 95% 
and associated implantation complications vary between 2% and 5%. Primary 
patency of iliac stents is 70-90% at three years. Venous stents have higher 
patency in the treatment of stenotic lesions compared to totally occlusive 
lesions. Primary patency of stents placed in the superior vena cava is also 
about 70-90% and generally lower in lesions due to malignancy likely related to
