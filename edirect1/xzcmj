The hepatitis C virus RNA genome possesses a variety of conserved structural 
elements, in both coding and non-coding regions, that are important for viral 
replication. These elements are known or predicted to modulate key life cycle 
events, such as translation and genome replication, some involving 
conformational changes induced by long-range RNA-RNA interactions. One such 
element is SLVI, a stem-loop (SL) structure located towards the 5' end of the 
core protein-coding region. This element forms an alternative RNA-RNA 
interaction with complementary sequences in the 5' untranslated regions that are 
independently involved in the binding of the cellular microRNA 122 (miR122). The 
switch between 'open' and 'closed' structures involving SLVI has previously been 
proposed to modulate translation, with lower translation efficiency associated 
with the 'closed' conformation. In the current study, we have used selective 
2'-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension to validate this RNA-RNA 
interaction in the absence and presence of miR122. We show that the long-range 
association (LRA) only forms in the absence of miR122, or otherwise requires the 
blocking of miR122 binding combined with substantial disruption of SLVI. Using 
site-directed mutations introduced to promote open or closed conformations of 
the LRA we demonstrate no correlation between the conformation and the 
translation phenotype. In addition, we observed no influence on virus 
replication compared to unmodified genomes. The presence of SLVI is 
well-documented to suppress translation, but these studies demonstrate that this 
is not due to its contribution to the LRA. We conclude that, although there are 
roles for SLVI in translation, the LRA is not a riboswitch regulating the 
translation and replication phenotypes of the virus.

Exendin-4 from Heloderma suspectum venom: From discovery to its latest 
application as type II diabetes combatant.

Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic non-communicable disease due to 
abnormal insulin actions causing uncontrolled hyperglycaemia. The treatment for 
T2DM, for instance, metformin and incretin mimetic, mainly focuses on the 
restoration of insulin sensitivity and secretion. Exendin-4 is a short 
incretin-mimetic peptide consisting of 39 amino acids. It is discovered in the 
venom of Heloderma suspectum as a full agonist for the glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1) receptor and produces insulinotropic effects. It is more resistant to 
enzymatic degradation by dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and has a longer half-life than 
the endogenous GLP-1; thus, it is further developed as an incretin hormone 
analogue used to treat T2DM. The helical region of the peptide first interacts 
with the extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) of GLP-1 receptor while the 
C-terminal extension containing the tryptophan cage further enhances its binding 
affinity. After binding to the NTD of the receptor, it may cause the receptor to 
switch from its auto-inhibited state of the receptor to its auto-activated 
state. Exendin-4 enhances the physiological functions of β-cells and the 
up-regulation of GLP-1 receptors, thus reducing the plasma glucose levels. 
Moreover, exendin-4 has also been found to ameliorate neuropathy, nephropathy 
and ventricular remodelling. The therapeutic effects of exendin-4 have also been 
extrapolated into several clinical trials. Although exendin-4 has a reasonable 
subcutaneous bioavailability, its half-life is rather short. Therefore, several 
modifications have been undertaken to improve its pharmacokinetics and 
insulinotropic potency. This review focuses on the pharmacology of exendin-4 and 
the structure-function relationships of exendin-4 with GLP-1 receptor. The 
review also highlights some challenges and future directions in the improvement 
of exendin-4 as an anti-diabetic drug.

Dengue is a serious global health problem endemic in Brazil. Consequently, our 
aim was to measure the costs and disease burden of symptomatic dengue infections 
in Brazil from the perspective of the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) 
between 2000 and 2015, using Brazilian public health system databases. Specific 
age group incidence estimates were used to calculate the disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) to gain a better understanding of the disease burden. Areas 
covered: SUS spent almost USD159 million and USD10 million to treat dengue and 
severe dengue, respectively, between 2000 and 2015. This is principally 
hospitalization costs, with the majority of patients self-treated at home with 
minor symptoms. The average notification rate for dengue was 273 per 100,000 
inhabitants and three per 100,000 for severe dengue, with annual DALYs estimates 
ranging between 72.35 and 6,824.45 during the 16 years. Expert commentary: The 
epidemiological and morbidity burden associated with dengue is substantial in 
Brazil, with costs affected by the fact that most patients self-treat at home 
with these costs not included in SUS. The Brazilian government urgently needs to 
proactively evaluate the real costs and clinical benefits of any potential 
dengue vaccination program by the National Immunization Program to guide future 
decision-making.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate economic outcomes associated with 
deep surgical site infection (SSI) in patients with an open fracture of the 
lower limb.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 460 patients were recruited from 24 specialist 
trauma hospitals in the United Kingdom Major Trauma Network. Preference-based 
health-related quality-of-life outcomes, assessed using the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L and 
the 6-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-6D), and economic costs 
(£, 2014/2015 prices) were measured using participant-completed questionnaires 
over the 12 months following injury. Descriptive statistics and multivariate 
regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between deep SSI and 
health utility scores, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and health and 
personal social service (PSS) costs.
RESULTS: Deep SSI was associated with lower EQ-5D-3L derived QALYs (adjusted 
mean difference -0.102, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.202 to 0.001, p = 0.047) 
and increased health and social care costs (adjusted mean difference £1950; 95% 
CI £1383 to £5285, p = 0.250) versus patients without deep SSI over the 12 
months following injury.
CONCLUSION: Deep SSI may lead to significantly impaired health-related quality 
of life and increased economic costs. Our economic estimates can be used to 
inform clinical and budgetary service planning and can act as reference data for 
future economic evaluations of preventive or treatment interventions. Cite this

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the quality and scope of the current 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) literature in the field of hand and upper limb 
orthopaedic surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE and the CEA 
Registry to identify CEAs that were conducted on or after 1 January 1997, that 
studied a procedure pertaining to the field of hand and upper extremity surgery, 
that were clinical studies, and that reported outcomes in terms of 
quality-adjusted life-years. We identified a total of 33 studies that met our 
inclusion criteria. The quality of these studies was assessed using the Quality 
of Health Economic Analysis (QHES) scale.
RESULTS: The mean total QHES score was 82 (high-quality). Over time, a greater 
proportion of these studies have demonstrated poorer QHES quality (scores < 75). 
Lower-scoring studies demonstrated several deficits, including failures in 
identifying reference perspectives, incorporating comparators and sensitivity 
analyses, discounting costs and utilities, and disclosing funding.
CONCLUSION: It will be important to monitor the ongoing quality of CEA studies 
in orthopaedics and ensure standards of reporting and comparability in 
accordance with Second Panel recommendations. Cite this article: Bone Joint J

BACKGROUND: Mass anthelmintic drug administration is recommended in developing 
countries to address infection by soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH). We 
quantified the public health benefit of treatment with mebendazole in eight 
million Vietnamese children aged 5-14 years from 2006 to 2011. This was compared 
to the environmental impact of the pharmaceutical supply chain of mebendazole, 
as the resource use and emissions associated with pharmaceutical production can 
be associated with a public health burden, e.g. through emissions of fine 
particulate matter.
METHODOLOGY: Through Markov modelling the disability due to STH was quantified 
for hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura. For each worm type, 
four levels of intensity of infection were included: none, light, medium and 
heavy. The treatment effect on patients was quantified in Disability-Adjusted 
Life Years (DALYs). The public health burden induced by the pharmaceutical 
supply chain of mebendazole was quantified in DALYs through Life Cycle 
Assessment.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to 'no treatment', the modelled results of 
five-year treatment averted 116,587 DALYs (68% reduction) for the three worms 
combined and largely driven by A. lumbricoides. The main change in DALYs 
occurred in the first year of treatment, after which the results stabilized. The 
public health burden associated with the pharmaceutical supply chain was 6 
DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: The public health benefit of the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) 
averted substantially more DALYs than those induced by the pharmaceutical supply 
chain. These results were verified in a sensitivity analysis. The starting 
prevalence for each worm was the most sensitive model parameter. This 
methodology is useful for policymakers interested in a holistic approach towards 
the public health performance of MDA programs, enveloping both the treatment 
benefit received by the patient and the public health burden associated with the 
resource consumption and environmental emissions of the pharmaceutical 
production and supply chain.

BACKGROUND: In schizophrenia spectrum disorders, negative symptoms (e.g. social 
withdrawal) may persist after initial treatment with antipsychotics, much 
affecting the quality of life (QOL) of patients. This health-economic study 
evaluated if a dedicated form of cognitive behaviour therapy for social 
activation (CBTsa) would reduce negative symptoms and improve QOL in an 
economically sustainable way.
METHODS: A health-economic evaluation was conducted alongside a single-blind 
randomised controlled trial in two parallel groups: guideline congruent 
treatment as usual (TAU; n = 50) versus TAU augmented with adjunct CBTsa (n = 
49). Outcomes were PANSS negative symptom severity and EQ-5D quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs) gained. The health-economic evaluation was conducted both 
from the societal and the health sector perspective.
RESULTS: Both conditions showed improvement in the respective outcomes over the 
follow-up period of six months, but QALY gains were significantly higher in the 
CBTsa condition compared to the TAU condition. Treatment response rate (i.e. ≥ 
5-point decrease on the PANSS) was not significantly different. However, the 
add-on CBT intervention was associated with higher costs. This did not support 
the idea that CBTsa is a cost-effective adjunct. Various sensitivity analyses 
attested to the robustness of these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Dutch context where TAU for psychosis is guideline congruent 
and well implemented there appears no added value for adjunct CBTsa. In other 
settings where the treatment for the schizophrenia spectrum disorders solely 
relies on antipsychotics, add-on CBTsa may lead to clinically superior outcomes, 
but it should still be evaluated if adjunct CBTsa therapy is a cost-effective 
alternative.

Characterization of mitochondrial proteomes of nonbilaterian animals.

University, Ames, IA, USA.

Mitochondria require ~1,500 proteins for their maintenance and proper 
functionality, which constitute the mitochondrial proteome (mt-proteome). 
Although a few of these proteins, mostly subunits of the electron transport 
chain complexes, are encoded in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the vast majority are 
encoded in the nuclear genome and imported to the organelle. Previous studies 
have shown a continuous and complex evolution of mt-proteome among eukaryotes. 
However, there was less attention paid to mt-proteome evolution within Metazoa, 
presumably because animal mtDNA and, by extension, animal mitochondria are often 
considered to be uniform. In this analysis, two bioinformatic approaches 
(Orthologue-detection and Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence prediction) were used 
to identify mt-proteins in 23 species from four nonbilaterian phyla: Cnidaria, 
Ctenophora, Placozoa, and Porifera, as well as two choanoflagellates, the 
closest animal relatives. Our results revealed a large variation in mt-proteome 
in nonbilaterian animals in size and composition. Myxozoans, highly reduced 
cnidarian parasites, possessed the smallest inferred mitochondrial proteomes, 
while calcareous sponges possessed the largest. About 513 mitochondrial 
orthologous groups were present in all nonbilaterian phyla and human. 
Interestingly, 42 human mitochondrial proteins were not identified in any 
nonbilaterian species studied and represent putative innovations along the 
bilaterian branch. Several of these proteins were involved in apoptosis and 
innate immunity, two processes known to evolve within Metazoa. Conversely, 
several proteins identified as mitochondrial in nonbilaterian phyla and animal 
outgroups were absent in human, representing cases of possible loss. Finally, a 
few human cytosolic proteins, such as histones and cytosolic ribosomal proteins, 
were predicted to be targeted to mitochondria in nonbilaterian animals. Overall, 
our analysis provides the first step in characterization of mt-proteomes in 
nonbilaterian animals and understanding evolution of animal mt-proteome. © 2018

Chronic exposures to cadmium (Cd) are associated with reduced glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR), increasing the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In 
support of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s initiative to estimate the 
global burden of foodborne diseases, a risk assessment was performed to estimate 
the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to late-stage CKD associated with 
dietary exposures to cadmium. Using the distribution of population GFRs, the 
prevalence of CKD was calculated as the proportion of humans whose GFR fall in 
the ranges corresponding to Stage 4 or Stage 5 CKD. The increase in the CKD 
prevalence due to cadmium exposure was simulated based on a previously reported 
pharmacokinetic model describing the relationship between dietary cadmium intake 
and urinary cadmium (UCd), as well as a previously published dose-response 
relationship between UCd and GFR. Cadmium-related incidence rate, calculated as 
the change in the prevalence during a one-year period, were used to compute the 
mortality and DALY in all WHO regions. It is estimated that dietary cadmium 
would result in a median of 12,224 stage 4 and stage 5 new CKD cases per year 
worldwide, resulting in 2064 global deaths and 70,513 DALYs. These data 
translate into a median global burden of 1.0 DALY per 100,000 population, which 
account for 0.2% of the global DALYs of CKD. While these results suggest that 
the overall impact of dietary cadmium exposure on global CKD is low, they do 
indicate that reasonable efforts to reduce dietary exposure will result a 
positive public health impact. This would be particularly the case in areas with 
elevated levels of dietary cadmium.

BACKGROUND: Recent estimates from the International Diabetes Federation Diabetes 
Atlas have quantified the total annual expenditure for diabetes in China to be 
between 354 and 611 billion Chinese yuan (¥) (2015).
OBJECTIVES: To use a modeling approach to assess the current and possible future 
diabetes burden in China on the basis of the current standard of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) management (status quo [SQ]) and a series of hypothetical improved 
management strategies.
METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to evaluate the economic burden 
of T2D in China on the basis of assumptions reflecting the current SQ of T2D 
management and a number of stepwise improvements. SQ was defined as a scenario 
in which T2D diagnosis is delayed by 4 years, treatment escalation to maintain 
glucose control occurs at a 9% glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) threshold, and there 
is an overall 60% adherence rate. Stepwise improvements considered immediate 
diagnosis, declining levels of HbA1c escalation thresholds to 7.0%, and 
improvements in adherence rate to 80% and 100%. The CORE Diabetes Model was 
applied on per-capita level to project lifetime costs and clinical outcomes of 
newly diseased T2D individuals in the Chinese setting. Model outcomes were 
subsequently annualized and extrapolated to Chinese national level considering 
the total number of diagnosed individuals with T2D in China.
RESULTS: The total annual direct costs attributable to diagnosed T2D in China 
reflecting current SQ management were estimated at ¥621 billion. Scenarios 
exploring stepwise improvements from SQ estimated annual net savings of ¥35, 
¥35, ¥60, ¥71, ¥75, and ¥106 billion for scenarios exploring immediate 
diagnosis, HbA1c threshold reductions to 8.0% and 7.0%, adherence rate increase 
to 80% and 100%, and cardiovascular risk factor control in concordance with 
clinical guidelines, respectively. Net savings resulted from reduced costs to 
treat diabetes complications (¥38, ¥67, ¥124, ¥141, ¥161, and ¥212 billion) and 
excess treatment costs alongside stepwise management improvements (¥4, ¥32, ¥65, 
¥69, ¥86, and ¥107 billion). Per-capita life expectancy was increased by 0.26, 
0.68, 1.33, 1.47, 1.69, and 3.21 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved T2D management strategies can help to decrease the 
financial burden of the disease and increase life expectancy of individuals with

BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) are a group of 
rare innate disorders characterized by specific antibody deficiency and 
increased rates of infections, comorbidities and mortality. The burden of CVID 
in Europe has not been previously estimated. We performed a retrospective 
analysis of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry data on 
the subset of patients classified by their immunologist as CVID and treated 
between 2004 and 2014. The registered deaths and comorbidities were used to 
calculate the annual average age-standardized rates of Years of Life Lost to 
premature death (YLL), Years Lost to Disability (YLD) and Disability Adjusted 
Life Years (DALY=YLL + YLD). These outcomes were expressed as a rate per 105 of 
the CVID cohort (the individual disease burden), and of the general population 
(the societal disease burden).
RESULTS: Data of 2700 patients from 23 countries were analysed. Annual 
comorbidity rates: bronchiectasis, 21.9%; autoimmunity, 23.2%; digestive 
disorders, 15.6%; solid cancers, 5.5%; lymphoma, 3.8%, exceeded the prevalence 
in the general population by a factor of 34.0, 7.6, 8.1, 2.4 and 32.6, 
respectively. The comorbidities of CVID caused 8722 (6069; 12,363) YLD/105 in 
this cohort, whereas 44% of disability burden was attributable to infections and 
bronchiectasis. The total individual burden of CVID was 36,785 (33,078, 41,380) 
DALY/105. With estimated CVID prevalence of ~ 1/ 25,000, the societal burden of 
CVID ensued 1.5 (1.3, 1.7) DALY/105 of the general population. In exploratory 
analysis, increased mortality was associated with solid tumor, HR (95% CI): 2.69 
(1.10; 6.57) p = 0.030, lymphoma: 5.48 (2.36; 12.71) p < .0001 and 
granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease: 4.85 (1.63; 14.39) 
p = 0.005. Diagnostic delay (median: 4 years) was associated with a higher risk 
of death: 1.04 (1.02; 1.06) p = .0003, bronchiectasis: 1.03 (1.01; 1.04) 
p = .0001, solid tumor: 1.08 (1.04; 1.11) p < .0001 and enteropathy: 1.02 (1.00; 
1.05) p = .0447 and stayed unchanged over four decades (p = .228).
CONCLUSIONS: While the societal burden of CVID may seem moderate, it is severe 
to the individual patient. Delay in CVID diagnosis may constitute a modifiable 
risk factor of serious comorbidities and death but showed no improvement. Tools 
supporting timely CVID diagnosis should be developed with high priority.

BACKGROUND: Poststroke gait disorders negatively impact activities of daily 
living. Rehabilitation for stroke patients is aimed at improving their walking 
ability, balance, and quality of life. Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) is 
associated with an increased number of task-specific exercises, which may 
benefit poststroke motor learning. We investigated the effects of RAGT using 
Stride Management Assist (SMA, which increases walk ratio by inducing hip-joint 
flexion and extension) in subacute stroke patients with hemiplegia.
METHODS: We conducted a single center, open-label randomized controlled trial in 
hemiplegia patients who experienced a first ever stroke and were admitted to the 
convalescent rehabilitation ward. A total of 41 were divided into the control 
(20 patients) and experimental group (21 patients). A 10-day, conventional gait 
training program was carried out for the control group; and RAGT with SMA was 
used for the experimental group. The maximum walking speed and other gait 
parameters were compared preintervention and postintervention. The intergroup 
differences in the improvement ratio were compared using an intention-to-treat 
analysis.
RESULTS: Ten-day intervention was completed by 36 patients. There was no 
difference between the 2 groups regarding gait parameters at intervention 
initiation. The improvement ratio of the maximum walking speed was significantly 
higher for the experimental group. Significant improvements were observed 
postintervention for maximum walking speed, paralysis-side step length, 
symmetry, and cadence in the experimental group. No adverse events attributable 
to the SMA were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Ten days of RAGT with the SMA was effective for improving gait 
disorders of subacute stroke patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a care manager (CM) programme 
compared with care as usual (CAU) for treatment of depression at primary care 
centres (PCCs) from a healthcare as well as societal perspective.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: 23 PCCs in two Swedish regions.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with depression (n=342).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A cost-effectiveness analysis was applied on a cluster 
randomised trial at PCC level where patients with depression had 3 months of 
contact with a CM (11 intervention PCCs, n=163) or CAU (12 control PCCs, n=179), 
with follow-up 3 and 6 months. Effectiveness measures were based on the number 
of depression-free days (DFDs) calculated from the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression 
Rating Scale-Self and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were 
expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: ∆Cost/∆QALY and 
∆Cost/∆DFD. Sampling uncertainty was assessed based on non-parametric 
bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Health benefits were higher in intervention group compared with CAU 
group: QALYs (0.357 vs 0.333, p<0.001) and DFD reduction of depressive symptom 
score (79.43 vs 60.14, p<0.001). The mean costs per patient for the 6-month 
period were €368 (healthcare perspective) and €6217 (societal perspective) for 
the intervention patients and €246 (healthcare perspective) and €7371 (societal 
perspective) for the control patients (n.s.). The cost per QALY gained was €6773 
(healthcare perspective) and from a societal perspective the CM programme was 
dominant.
DISCUSSION: The CM programme was associated with a gain in QALYs as well as in 
DFD, while also being cost saving compared with CAU from a societal perspective. 
This result is of high relevance for decision-makers on a national level, but it 
must be observed that a CM programme for depression implies increased costs at 
the primary care level.

PURPOSE: Clinical practice guidelines recommend incorporating long-term life 
expectancy to inform a number of decisions in primary care. We aimed to examine 
older adults' preferences for discussing life expectancy in a national sample.
METHODS: We invited 1,272 older adults (aged 65 or older) from a national, 
probability-based online panel to participate in 2016. We presented a 
hypothetical patient with limited life expectancy who was not imminently dying. 
We asked participants if they were that patient, whether they would like to talk 
with the doctor about how long they may live, whether it was acceptable for the 
doctor to offer this discussion, whether they want the doctor to discuss life 
expectancy with family or friends, and when it should be discussed.
RESULTS: The 878 participants (69.0% participation rate) had a mean age of 73.4 
years. The majority, 59.4%, did not want to discuss how long they might live in 
the presented scenario. Within this group, 59.9% also did not think that the 
doctor should offer the discussion, and 87.7% also did not want the doctor to 
discuss life expectancy with family or friends. Fully 55.8% wanted to discuss 
life expectancy only if it were less than 2 years. Factors positively associated 
with wanting to have the discussion included higher educational level, believing 
that doctors can accurately predict life expectancy, and past experience with 
either a life-threatening illness or having discussed life expectancy of a loved 
one. Reporting that religion is important was negatively associated.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of older adults did not wish to discuss life 
expectancy when we depicted a hypothetical patient with limited life expectancy. 
Many also did not want to be offered discussion, raising a dilemma for how 
clinicians may identify patients' preferences regarding this sensitive topic.

BACKGROUND: The Short Course Oncology Therapy (SCOT) study is an international, 
multicentre, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial assessing the efficacy, 
toxicity, and cost-effectiveness of 3 months (3 M) versus the usually given 6 
months (6 M) of adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.
METHODS: In total, 6088 patients with fully resected high-risk stage II or stage 
III colorectal cancer were randomised and followed up for 3-8 years. The 
within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis from a UK health-care perspective is 
presented using the resource use data, quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), time on 
treatment (ToT), disease-free survival after treatment (DFS) and overall 
survival (OS) data. Quality-adjusted partitioned survival analysis and 
Kaplan-Meier Sample Average Estimator estimated QALYs and costs. Probabilistic 
sensitivity and subgroup analysis was undertaken.
RESULTS: The 3 M arm is less costly (-£4881; 95% CI: -£6269; -£3492) and entails 
(non-significant) QALY gains (0.08; 95% CI: -0.086; 0.230) due to a better 
significant quality of life. The net monetary benefit was significantly higher 
in 3 M under a wide range of monetary values of a QALY. The subgroup analysis 
found similar results for patients in the CAPOX regimen. However, for the FOLFOX 
regimen, 3 M had lower QALYs than 6 M (not statistically significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 3 M dominates 6 M with no significant detrimental impact 
on QALYs. The results provide the economic case that a 3 M treatment strategy 
should be considered a new standard of care.

PURPOSE: Older people with advanced frailty are among the highest consumers of 
medications. When life expectancy is limited, some of these medications are 
likely to be inappropriate. The aim of this study was to compare STOPPFrail, a 
concise, easy-to-use, deprescribing tool based on explicit criteria, with gold 
standard, systematic geriatrician-led deprescribing.
METHODS: One hundred standardized clinical cases involving 1024 medications were 
prepared. Clinical cases were based on anonymized hospitalized patients aged 
≥ 65 years, with advanced frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale ≥ 6), receiving ≥ 5 
regular medications, who were selected from a recent observational study. Level 
of agreement between deprescribing methods was measured by Cohen's kappa 
coefficient. Sensitivity and positive predictive value of STOPPFrail-guided 
deprescribing relative to gold standard deprescribing was also measured.
RESULTS: Overall, 524 medications (51.2%) of medications prescribed to this 
frail, elderly cohort were potentially inappropriate by gold standard criteria. 
STOPPFrail-guided deprescribing led to the identification of 70.2% of the 
potentially inappropriate medications. Cohen's kappa was 0.60 (95% confidence 
interval 0.55-0.65; p < 0.001) indicating moderate agreement between 
STOPPFrail-guided and gold standard deprescribing. The positive predictive value 
of STOPPFrail was 89.3% indicating that the great majority of deprescribing 
decisions aligned with gold standard care.
CONCLUSIONS: STOPPFrail removes an important barrier to deprescribing by 
explicitly highlighting circumstances where commonly used medications can be 
safely deprescribed in older people with advanced frailty. Our results suggest 
that in multi-morbid older patients with advanced frailty, the use of STOPPFrail 
criteria to address inappropriate polypharmacy may be reasonable alternative to 
specialist medication review.

BACKGROUND: South Africa (SA) has one of the world's largest HIV treatment 
programmes, to which a dramatic increase in life expectancy has been attributed. 
However, there continue to be concerns regarding the reporting of HIV-related 
mortality in SA, which varies by source. As accurate HIV mortality estimates are 
key to measuring the success of the national programme as well as identifying 
areas for improvement, we propose a complementary approach to monitoring changes 
in HIV-related mortality using routine inpatient records to examine trends in 
causes of death and HIV status over time.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of this approach by calculating 
mortality due to natural causes in the medical ward of a hospital during 2010 by 
HIV status.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of inpatient mortality at a 
regional hospital in Johannesburg, SA, analysing all deaths due to natural 
causes among adult medical ward inpatients. Cause of death was recorded from the 
mortuary register. HIV status was ascertained directly from the mortuary 
register or from laboratory tests specific for HIV diagnosis or monitoring.
RESULTS: Of 1 167 inpatients who died, the majority were HIV-positive (58%). HIV 
positivity among males (55%) was slightly lower than that among females (61%), 
and HIV-positive patients were younger (median 40 years) than those who were 
HIV-negative (56 years) and of unknown HIV status (68 years). 'Infections and 
parasites' was the most common cause of natural death (29%). On average, 
HIV-positive patients were admitted for slightly longer (mean 10.5 days) than 
HIV-negative patients (9.6 days) and those of unknown HIV status (8.9 days), yet 
HIV-positive inpatient deaths accounted for the majority (62%) of the total bed 
days.
CONCLUSIONS: Even with widespread access to antiretroviral therapy, the majority 
of inpatient natural deaths at a large public sector hospital in 2010 were of 
HIV-positive patients and were probably related to HIV. In view of the 
importance of accurate data on causes of death, both for the HIV programme and 
to track other diseases, large-scale expansion of this approach over a longer 
period should be considered.
