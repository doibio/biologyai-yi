(10-year cumulative incidence of hip fracture of 14%), the ICERs improved 
significantly: $105,000 per QALY and $137,000 per hip fracture averted. The 
ICERs improved significantly if the proportion of prescriptions for generic 
bisphosphonates was increased to 75%, with $113,000 per QALY and $77,900 per hip 
fracture averted.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence implementation programs for the management of GIOP are 
likely to be cost-effective to third-party health insurers only if they are 
targeted at individuals with a very high risk of fracture and the proportion of 
prescriptions for less expensive generic bisphosphonates increases 
substantially.

It is amazing to see how much the approach of the food risk analysis evolved in 
the recent years. For half a century and the birth of the risk assessment 
methodology in the food domain, only no appreciable health risk was considered 
acceptable by the manager. This is the vocabulary used in the case of a 
voluntary, deliberated human action, as the use of food additives (definition of 
ADI). In the case of risks not resulting from such an action, as that of the 
presence of contaminants, the risk assessor allocates provisional tolerable 
daily, weekly or monthly intake that are the basis for regulation. This 
vocabulary is in agreement with the objective which consists in approaching 
closer possible of the zero risk which is the wish of a majority of the 
consumers. Some years ago, the risk managers insisted to obtain from the 
assessors as often as possible a quantitative risk evaluation. More recently 
even, the managers would like to decide on the basis of a balance of risk and 
benefit acceptable for management purposes. Finally, they hope that general 
principles and tools will be available for conducting a quantitative 
risk-benefit analysis for foods and food ingredients. What is possible in the 
case of functional foods (FF)? Based on the definition of FF proposed in the 
programme FUFOSE, one has to distinguish between different situations in order 
to assess the risk: that of a micro-, that of a macro-component or that of a 
whole food. These situations have been clearly described in the document 
resulting from FOSIE. The standardized methodology relevant to assess 
micro-components is not well adapted to the assessment of whole food. Concepts 
of substantial equivalence and of history of safe use could be useful tools in 
this case. However, quantitative risk assessment remains a very difficult 
exercise. If a process for the assessment of health benefit of FF has been 
proposed as an outcome of the PASSCLAIM action, the quantification of this 
benefit needs adequate tools. An EFSA scientific colloquium on "Risk-Benefit 
Analysis of Foods" organized in July 2006 concluded that the risk-benefit 
analysis should mirror the current risk analysis paradigm and that its 
assessment should be performed with common scales. Disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs) or quality adjusted life years (QUALYs) have been proposed as some 
of these common scales. However, the meeting "concluded that the data available 
to undertake a quantitative risk-benefit assessment may be too scarce". Because 
it was considered that it was premature to formulate guidelines on good 
risk-benefit analysis practice and it is now time to "learning by doing", a 
reference to the upcoming ILSI Europe project BRAFO was done. All these aspects 
are discussed, in particular in relation to the specific case of FF.

Drosophila growth cones: a genetically tractable platform for the analysis of 
axonal growth dynamics.

The formation of neuronal networks, during development and regeneration, 
requires outgrowth of axons along reproducible paths toward their appropriate 
postsynaptic target cells. Axonal extension occurs at growth cones (GCs) at the 
tips of axons. GC advance and navigation requires the activity of their 
cytoskeletal networks, comprising filamentous actin (F-actin) in lamellipodia 
and filopodia as well as dynamic microtubules (MTs) emanating from bundles of 
the axonal core. The molecular mechanisms governing these two cytoskeletal 
networks, their cross-talk, and their response to extracellular signaling cues 
are only partially understood, hindering our conceptual understanding of how 
regulated changes in GC behavior are controlled. Here, we introduce Drosophila 
GCs as a suitable model to address these mechanisms. Morphological and 
cytoskeletal readouts of Drosophila GCs are similar to those of other models, 
including mammals, as demonstrated here for MT and F-actin dynamics, axonal 
growth rates, filopodial structure and motility, organizational principles of MT 
networks, and subcellular marker localization. Therefore, we expect fundamental 
insights gained in Drosophila to be translatable into vertebrate biology. The 
advantage of the Drosophila model over others is its enormous amenability to 
combinatorial genetics as a powerful strategy to address the complexity of 
regulatory networks governing axonal growth. Thus, using pharmacological and 
genetic manipulations, we demonstrate a role of the actin cytoskeleton in a 
specific form of MT organization (loop formation), known to regulate GC pausing 
behavior. We demonstrate these events to be mediated by the actin-MT linking 
factor Short stop, thus identifying an essential molecular player in this 
context.

Modified Harrington reconstruction for advanced periacetabular metastatic 
disease.

California Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Destructive metastatic lesions about the acetabulum 
result in pain and functional limitations. We assessed whether periacetabular 
reconstruction (PAR) improves quality of life by examining outcome measures of 
pain, function, and mobility.
METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with a mean follow-up of 23.6 months (range, 
0.5-112 months) were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent modified 
Harrington reconstruction with periacetabular screws, cement, and total hip 
arthroplasty.
RESULTS: The mean preoperative MSTS score of 14 (47%, 14/30) improved to 20 
(67%, 20/30) after the procedure. Thirty-five patients who were alive 1 month 
after the procedure were reviewed for outcome. Postoperatively, patients 
reported a significant improvement in pain (P < 0.0001), mobility (P < 0.0385), 
and function (P < 0.0186). Kaplan-Meier survivorship curves showed 59% implant- 
and 55% patient survival at 2 years; and 49% implant- and 39% patient survival 
at 5 years. Complications included infection (16%, 6/37) and instability (16%, 
6/37).
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with PAR has shown good results with improved 
postoperative functional scores. Implants will generally exceed life expectancy 
and are an option to restore quality of life.

The spectrum of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including unstable angina, 
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and ST-elevation myocardial infarction 
accounts for increasing numbers of deaths among persons age > or = 65 years in 
the US. This is important given demographic changes involving falling birth 
rates and increasing life expectancy. Elderly patients are likely to benefit the 
most from treatment of ACS, even though community practice still demonstrates 
less use of cardiac medications as an early-invasive approach among this 
population.

Seriously ill patients' discussions of preparation and life completion: an 
intervention to assist with transition at the end of life.

OBJECTIVE: Patients approaching the end of life not only face challenges to 
physical well-being but also threats to emotional and spiritual integrity. Yet, 
identifying appropriate, effective, and brief interventions to address those 
concerns has proven elusive. We developed an intervention based on life review 
and emotional disclosure literatures and conducted a pilot study to determine 
feasibility and acceptability. This article presents qualitative intervention 
responses.
METHOD: We conducted a three-armed randomized control trial to evaluate the 
effects of preparation and life completion discussion on health outcomes in 
patients with advanced serious illness. Hospice-eligible subjects were randomly 
assigned to one of three groups: (1) intervention (life completion discussion 
intervention), (2) attention control (relaxation meditation), and control (no 
intervention). Subjects in the intervention arm met with a facilitator three 
times. Session 1 focused on life story, Session 2 on forgiveness, and Session 3, 
on heritage and legacy.
RESULTS: Eighteen subjects participated in the pilot intervention interviews. 
Subjects from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds completed the intervention 
with equal facility. Results from Session 1 demonstrate narrative responses 
participants gave as they reconnected with previous life roles, values, and 
accomplishments. The second session illustrated reflections of choices one might 
have made differently and exploration of forgiveness offered and sought. Content 
from the first and second sessions laid the foundation for discussing Session 
3's lessons learned and heritage and legacy. Responses are summarized to assist 
clinicians in anticipating life review content that may improve overall quality 
of life at the end of life.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Discussions of life completion may improve important 
health outcomes for patients at the end of life. This intervention may provide a 
brief, standardized, and transportable means for improving the quality of life 
of patients with advanced serious illness.

"The healthy me appears": palliative cancer patients' experiences of 
participation in a physical group exercise program.

hanne.paltiel@stolav.no

OBJECTIVE: Tentative results from a pilot study showed that patients with 
advanced cancer were willing and able to take part in a group exercise 
intervention. Limited knowledge exists, though, about the meaning and 
significance of such programs. The purpose of the present study was to 
understand the meaning of such an intervention for the individual participant 
and thereby to provide knowledge for shaping future clinical practice.
METHODS: Thirty-four palliative cancer patients with a life expectancy of less 
than 1 year completed a 6-week group exercise program. Five randomly selected 
individuals were interviewed 7 months after completion. Results from a 
self-report evaluation questionnaire identified relevant themes that formed the 
basis of an interview guide. These were addressed in a semistructured interview. 
Verbatim transcripts were analyzed with a phenomenological-hermeneutical 
approach.
RESULTS: Two main themes emerged from the interviews: (1) perceptions of the 
group and (2) a secure and caring setting for the group. Themes identified 
regarding perception of the group were a sense of belonging and commitment. 
Themes identified regarding a secure and caring setting for the group were a 
life-empowering group as a setting for enhancing coping, the qualifications of 
those who led the group, and a public gym as an unsuitable setting.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Our study indicates that an individually adjusted group 
exercise program, with competent leaders, can provide a setting to enhance 
psychological well-being in cancer patients with life expectancy below 1 year. 
Small sample size, however, limits the possibility to generalize the findings.

PURPOSE: To conduct a cost-utility analysis and determine the cost-effectiveness 
of the Boston Keratoprosthesis (Boston Kpro).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: setting: The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary corneal service. 
patients: Inclusion required a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patients with 
autoimmune diseases and chemical burns were excluded. Eighty-two patients were 
included with various indications for surgery. intervention: The 
keratoprosthesis is a collar button-shaped polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) device 
consisting of 2 curved plates sandwiched around a corneal donor (allo)graft. The 
device is assembled intraoperatively and sutured to a patient's eye after 
removing the diseased cornea.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was 
determined by cost-utility analysis, using expected-value calculations and 
time-tradeoff utilities. The comparative effectiveness, or gain in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), was also sought. Cost-effectiveness was 
compared to recently published data on penetrating keratoplasty (PK).
RESULTS: A total discounted incremental QALY gain for the Boston Kpro of 0.763 
correlated with a conferred QALY gain of 20.3% for the average patient. The 
average cost-effectiveness of the keratoprosthesis was $16 140 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparable to corneal transplantation, with a cost-effectiveness 
between $12 000 and $16 000 per QALY, the keratoprosthesis can be considered 
highly cost-effective.

A cost-minimisation analysis of lobectomy: thoracoscopic versus posterolateral 
thoracotomy.

USA. burfeiw@slhn.org

OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that lobectomy performed either through 
thoracoscopy (TL) or via a posterolateral thoracotomy (PLT) produces equivalent 
oncologic outcomes in appropriately selected patients. Advantages of 
thoracoscopic lobectomy include decreased postoperative pain, shorter length of 
stay, fewer postoperative complications and better compliance with adjuvant 
chemotherapy. This study evaluates the costs associated with lobectomy performed 
thoracoscopically or via thoracotomy.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of actual costing and prospectively 
collected health-related quality of life (QOL) outcomes. Between 2002 and 2004, 
113 patients underwent lobectomy (PLT: n=37; TL: n=76) and completed QOL 
assessments both preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively. Actual fixed and 
variable direct costs from the preoperative, hospitalisation and 30-day 
postoperative phases were captured using a T1 cost accounting system and were 
combined with actual professional collections. Cost-utility analysis was 
performed by transforming a global QOL measurement to an estimate of utility and 
calculating a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for each patient.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Total costs 
(USD) were significantly greater for the strategy of PLT (USD 12,119) than for 
TL (USD 10,084; p=0.0012). Even when only stage I and II lung cancers were 
included (n=32 PLT, n=69 TL), total costs for PLT were still higher than that 
for TL (USD 11,998 vs USD 10,120; p=0.005). The mean QALY for the PLT group was 
0.74+/-0.22 and for the TL group was 0.72+/-0.18 (p=0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, TL was significantly less expensive 
than PLT from the preoperative evaluation through 30 days postoperatively, with 
overall savings of approximately USD 2000 per patient. In light of equivalent 
QALY outcomes, this cost-utility analysis supports increased adoption of TL as a 
cost-minimisation strategy. The use of TL for the 50,000 lobectomies performed 
in the United States each year would represent a savings of approximately USD 
100 million.

Rheumatism Research Centre, Berlin DE-13353, Germany. minden@drfz.de

BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the long-term outcomes of patients with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has evolved during the past decade. Recent studies, 
using standardized classification criteria, new and reliable outcome measures 
and improved methods of statistical analyses, show that outcomes are still less 
than ideal. Approximately half of all young adults with JIA have ongoing active 
disease and over one third experience detectable degrees of disability and organ 
damage. These patients also show a distinctive pattern of growth disturbances. 
Most patients with general growth failure have systemic or polyarticular 
disease: significant short stature (final height standard deviation score <-2) 
has been noted in 41% of patients with systemic JIA and in 11% of patients with 
polyarticular JIA. In contrast, localized growth disturbances can be seen in 
patients with oligoarthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its name, JIA can be a lifelong disorder. With early and 
more widespread use of biological and other innovative therapies, however, 
outcomes for patients with JIA should improve further.

Degenerative spondylolisthesis in patients with neurogenic claudication effects 
functional performance and self-reported quality of life.

Burlington, VT 05405, USA. tucker.drury@vtmednet.org

STUDY DESIGN: The effect of degenerative spondylolisthesis on functional 
performance and self reported quality of life in patients with lumbar spinal 
stenosis was compared to patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and no 
degenerative spondylolisthesis.
OBJECTIVE: To define the relationship degenerative spondylolisthesis shares with 
functional performance and self reported quality of life in patients with 
symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Neurogenic claudication is a clinical syndrome that 
reflects symptoms caused by anatomic spinal stenosis. This condition limits 
functional status and impacts overall health satisfaction. Degenerative 
spondylolisthesis is one cause of spinal stenosis and is present to different 
degrees in patients with neurogenic claudication.
METHODS: Thirty-eight women and 39 men diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and 
neurogenic claudication were prospectively enrolled in the study. All underwent 
routine, screening side-lying, lateral flexion and extension radiographs. The 
evaluation included a shuttle walking test, as well as patient self-assessment 
using the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire, and Short Form 36.
RESULTS: The overall walking distance did not differ based on the presence of 
degenerative spondylolisthesis. No correlation between magnitude of deformity 
and decreased walking distance was identified. Men walked on average 231.3 m 
(SD: 159.2) and women walked 251.3 m (SD: 138.4). No statistical difference was 
noted between men and women and their walking ability (P < 0.56). The Swiss 
Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and the Short Form 36 were both strongly 
correlated with decreased walking ability (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The presence and magnitude of degenerative spondylolisthesis does 
not correlate with decreased functional capacity. The Swiss Spinal Stenosis 
Questionnaire and Short Form 36 are accurate in defining the functional status 
of a patient. Comprehensive evaluation of patients with symptomatic lumbar 
spinal stenosis using functional assessment and self-assessment questionnaires 
are helpful in determining the severity of a patient's disability. Plain 
radiographs may be valuable adjuncts for surgical decision-making, but are not 
useful in quantifying the degree to which a patient is impaired.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of three treatments for age-related macular 
degeneration.

Author information:

School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA. egower1@jhmi.edu

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
pegaptanib sodium and ranibizumab injections compared with photodynamic therapy 
(PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization 
secondary to age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: The analyses were performed using outcomes data from the pivotal trials 
for each treatment and the medicare reimbursable costs for each treatment and 
associated medical procedures. A multistate transition model with 3-month cycles 
was created to compare incremental medical costs associated with pegaptanib or 
ranibizumab versus PDT for patients with starting vision of 20/40, 20/80, and 
20/200 Snellen equivalent.
RESULTS: Two-year medical treatment costs ranged from $3,100 to $54,100 
depending on treatment and lesion type. Photodynamic therapy was less costly and 
more effective than pegaptanib for predominantly classic and minimally classic 
lesions. Ranibizumab was not only more effective but also more costly than PDT 
for all lesion types.
CONCLUSION: Compared with PDT, pegaptanib is inferior in both cost and 
effectiveness, whereas ranibizumab has a greater effectiveness. Because 
ranibizumab does not meet 1 of the common thresholds for being considered cost 
effective (<$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year), there is rationale to seek 
other therapies that are more cost effective.

Mapping analyses to estimate health utilities based on responses to the OM8-30 
Otitis Media Questionnaire.

Author information:
(1)Health Economics Research Centre, Department of Public Health, University of 
Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford, UK. Helen.dakin@dphpc.ox.ac.uk

PURPOSE: To investigate the statistical relationship between the OM8-30 
health-related quality of life measure for children with otitis media with 
effusion (OME) and measures of health utility (Health Utilities Index [HUI] Mark 
3 and Mark 2) and to develop models to estimate HUI3 and HUI2 health utilities 
from OM8-30 scores.
METHODS: A placebo-controlled, randomised trial (GNOME) evaluating intranasal 
mometasone in 217 children with OME provided concurrent responses to OM8-30 and 
HUI at three time points. Ordinary least squares (OLS), generalised linear 
models and two-step regression analyses were used to predict HUI3 and HUI2 
utilities based on OM8-30 facet and domain scores.
RESULTS: OLS models including all nine OM8-30 facets with or without predicted 
hearing level (HL) produced the best predictions of HUI3 utilities (mean 
absolute error: 0.134 with HL and 0.132 without; R(2): 0.63 with HL and 0.596 
without). An OLS model predicting HUI3 utilities based on the two OM8-30 domain 
scores, reported hearing difficulties, predicted HL, age and sex also produced 
accurate predictions.
CONCLUSION: Regression equations predicting HUI3 and HUI2 utilities based on 
OM8-30 facet and domain scores have been developed. These provide an empirical 
basis for estimating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for interventions in 
children with OME.

How do we increase activity and participation in our patients?

Zuwallack RL(1).

Connecticut 06105, USA. rzuwalla@stfranciscare.org

Patients with chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are generally very inactive physically, and this physical 
inactivity is detrimental to their health. Physical inactivity not only impairs 
quality of life, it probably shortens life expectancy. Therefore, increasing 
physical activity should be a prominent goal in pulmonary rehabilitation. 
Physical activity levels correlate better with functional exercise capacity, 
such as the 6-minute walk distance, than abnormalities on pulmonary function 
tests. Because functional exercise capacity increases with pulmonary 
rehabilitation, and other important factors such as motivation and self-efficacy 
for exercise are also improved, it stands to reason pulmonary rehabilitation 
should increase activity and participation in extended activities of daily 
living. Indeed, an emerging medical literature suggests that this is so. We 
still need to know how effective we are in this area because meaningful changes 
in some of our outcomes, such as activity counts from motion detectors, have not 
been established. Pulmonary rehabilitation should incorporate specific 
interventions to make increased activity and participation specific goals of 
this comprehensive intervention.

A review was undertaken to identify relevant and appropriate heath-utility 
estimates for patients with atrial fibrillation who had stroke and to appraise 
them against the published requirements for several countries' Health Technology 
Assessment agencies: Australia (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee), 
Canada (Common Drug Review), England and Wales (NICE), Germany (Institut für 
Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen), Scotland (Scottish 
Medicines Consortium) and Sweden (Tandvårds-och läkemedelsförmånsverket). 
National agencies have created guidelines to support economic evaluations for 
their own countries but these guidelines differ. It may be more appropriate for 
agencies to be concerned primarily with the methodological quality of studies 
that report utilities rather than identifying local values. As such, we 
recommend some steps that could be considered when assessing the quality of 
utility studies in a systematic review or meta-analysis. These steps include 
considering the methods of utility estimation, model needs, generalizability, 
sample size and the use of large databases. This may, thus, facilitate 
consistent and rational Health Technology Assessment decision making.

A 40 year old welder who underwent opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy for 
correction of alignment in a varus knee developed persistent pain with loss of 
knee extension. The posterior tibial slope increased from 9 degrees to 20 
degrees after the osteotomy and caused the anteromedial knee pain and limited 
extension. The patient then underwent a revision osteotomy using a closing wedge 
technique to correct tibial slope. The osteotomy was performed, first from the 
medial cortex in the lateral direction, and second in the anteroposterior 
direction to remove the tibial bone in wedge shape and obtain full extension of 
the knee. The posterior tibial slope decreased to 8 degrees after the revision 
osteotomy and the patients returned to pain-free daily life. We reviewed this 
unique technique for correction of sagittal malalignment using a closing-wedge 
osteotomy for revision after opening-wedge osteotomy.

treatment utilities.

BACKGROUND: Men with prostate cancer are often challenged to choose between 
conservative management and a range of available treatment options each carrying 
varying risks and benefits. The trade-offs are between an improved 
life-expectancy with treatment accompanied by important risks such as urinary 
incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Previous studies of preference 
elicitation for prostate cancer treatment have found considerable heterogeneity 
in individuals' preferences for health states given similar treatments and 
clinical risks.
METHODS: Using latent class mixture model (LCA), we first sought to understand 
if there are unique patterns of heterogeneity or subgroups of individuals based 
on their prostate cancer treatment utilities (calculated time trade-off 
utilities for various health states) and if such unique subgroups exist, what 
demographic and urological variables may predict membership in these subgroups.
RESULTS: The sample (N=244) included men with prostate cancer (n=188) and men 
at-risk for disease (n=56). The sample was predominantly white (77%), with mean 
age of 60 years (SD+/-9.5). Most (85.9%) were married or living with a 
significant other. Using LCA, a three class solution yielded the best model 
evidenced by the smallest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), substantial 
reduction in BIC from a 2-class solution, and Lo-Mendell-Rubin significance of 
<.001. The three identified clusters were named high-traders (n=31), low-traders 
(n=116), and no-traders (n=97). High-traders were more likely to trade survival 
time associated with treatment to avoid potential risks of treatment. 
Low-traders were less likely to trade survival time and accepted risks of 
treatment. The no-traders were likely to make no trade-offs in any direction 
favouring the status quo. There was significant difference among the clusters in 
the importance of sexual activity (Pearson's chi2=16.55, P=0.002; Goodman and 
Kruskal tau=0.039, P<0.001). In multinomial logistic regression, the level of 
importance assigned to sexual activity remained an independent predictor of 
class membership. Age and prostate cancer/at-risk status were not significant 
factors in the multinomial model.
CONCLUSION: Most existing utility work is undertaken focusing on how people 
choose on average. Distinct clusters of prostate cancer treatment utilities in 
our sample point to the need for further understanding of subgroups and need for 
tailored assessment and interventions.

Survival analysis approach to insect life table analysis and hypothesis testing: 
with particular reference to Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko)) 
populations.

The goal of this paper is to examine and demonstrate that survival analysis, 
which has been a de facto standard in biomedical research since the 1990s but 
has not been widely adopted in entomology yet, should possess similar potential 
in entomological research. The following three objectives are set to achieve 
this goal: (i) addressing a fundamental issue - censoring or incomplete 
observations; (ii) demonstrating the application of survival analysis to analyze 
insect life tables; and (iii) applying survival analysis for hypothesis testing. 
The data used to demonstrate the applications is from our laboratory 
experiments, which recorded the development, survival and reproduction of 1800 
Russian wheat aphids (Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), RWA) under 25 treatments of 
temperature and plant-growth stage. With regard to the first two objectives, 
besides examining the near ubiquitous existence of censoring in insect 
population research, we constructed and analyzed life tables of 1800 RWA 
individuals with survival analysis. We further demonstrate that there could be 
very significant differences in life table parameters, such as median 
development times with and without considering censoring. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first recognition in entomology that censoring, which is 
hardly avoidable, can cause significant systematical bias (ranging between 
4-25%; table 1) in insect development data analysis. As for the third objective, 
the study shows that four statistics from survival analysis can be applied to 
testing the effects of covariates, such as temperature and plant-growth stage, 
on development and survival of the Russian wheat aphid. The advantages of 
survival analysis include the handling of censored observations, survival 
probabilities in the form of rigorous survivor function vs. simple survival 
rates, dynamic modeling of covariates effects on development and survival with a 
unified model structure, etc. The methods demonstrated in this article should 
also be useful for entomological research beyond insect demography, such as 
bioassay, assessment of natural enemies, the studies of insect behaviors, etc.

Population aging is a global phenomenon. It is estimated that there were 600 
million people in the world aged 60 and over in 2000 and that there will be 1.2 
billion by 2025. People aged 65 and over comprise 16% of the population of 
Europe. About half of the world's elderly population live in the developing 
world. Many of the gastrointestinal disorders seen in specialist practise show 
age-specific incidence and prevalence rates that increase substantially with 
increasing age. In this review, hospitalization rates for gastroenterological 
disorders in England are presented by age to demonstrate gradients with age. 
Some of the disorders, such as colorectal cancer, appendicitis, diverticular 
disease and inflammatory bowel disease, became common in developed countries in 
association with economic development and changes in lifestyle. As the 
developing world becomes more urbanised and westernised, disorders that are now 
rare in the developing world will probably become much more common.

Surgical aspects in management of hepato-pancreatico-biliary tumours in the 
elderly.

Hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) surgery encompasses major hepatic resection and 
pancreatic surgery, both procedures of high complexity with a potentially high 
complication rate. The establishment of centres of excellence with a high 
patient volume has lowered the complication and increased the resection rate. 
Besides this, increased life expectancy and improved general health status have 
increased the number of elderly patients eligible for major surgery. Because 
elderly patients have more co-morbidities and decreased life expectancy, the 
benefit of these procedures must be critically evaluated in such patients. 
Analysis of the literature on this subject demonstrated that 
pancreatico-duodenectomy can be performed safely in selected elderly patients 
(80 years of age or older), with morbidity and mortality rates approaching those 
observed in younger patients. This aspect was also confirmed by cost analysis 
studies that reported similar data in both groups. Similar findings are also 
reported for major hepatic resection in elderly patients with either 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Klatskin tumour or gallbladder carcinoma. 
Nevertheless, those elderly patients who will benefit from surgery must be 
critically selected.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of an eccentric resistance exercise 
training protocol in men with prostate cancer and to assess whether men with 
prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have a 
blunted effect from the training as compared with prostate cancer survivors not 
receiving ADT.
DESIGN: Prospective pilot study.
SETTING: Academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen men with prostate cancer (Gleason scores 3+3 to 4+4) were 
initially enrolled. Ten men (mean age 66, range 48-86) completed the study, 5 
were currently receiving ADT. Analysis was performed on these 10 men.
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were evaluated at baseline. All men underwent a 12-week 
resistance exercise training protocol using a recumbent, high-force eccentric, 
leg cycle ergometer 3 times per week at a "somewhat hard" perceived exertion for 
12 to 15 minutes. Preexercise and postexercise training changes were examined 
within and between groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quadriceps muscle volume (magnetic resonance imaging), 
isometric knee extension strength, functional mobility (Timed Up and Go Test 
[TUG] and 6-minute walk [6MW]), health-related quality of life (FACT-P), and 
fatigue (FACIT-fatigue scale).
RESULTS: The ADT group demonstrated significant within-group improvements in the 
6MW (P = .01) and isometric knee extension strength (P = .03). This group also 
demonstrated a clinically relevant change in the FACT-P; however, this did not 
meet statistical significance. The non-ADT group demonstrated significant 
within-group improvements in the physical subscale of the FACT-P (P = .03) and 
an increase in muscle volume (P = .04). Their improvements in the TUG approached 
significance (P = .08). No between-group differences existed.
CONCLUSIONS: Eccentric resistance exercise was well tolerated, and both groups 
derived some benefits in strength and functional mobility. Men receiving ADT did 
not appear to have a blunted response to the exercise as compared with prostate 
cancer survivors not receiving ADT.

University Hospital, SE-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden. kevin.mani@surgsci.uu.se

Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in high-risk groups has been 
recommended based on a high prevalence of disease, while being questioned due to 
a high frequency of co-morbidities and inferior life-expectancy. We evaluated 
the long-term outcome and the cost-effectiveness of selective AAA screening 
among patients referred to the vascular laboratory for arterial examination.
METHODS: A total of 5,924 patients, referred to the vascular laboratory of a 
university hospital, were screened for AAA with ultrasound (definition: slashed 
circle>or=30 mm), 1993-2005. Outcome data were gathered through hospital records 
and the national population registry. A Markov model was used for 
health-economic evaluation.
RESULTS: An AAA was detected in 181 patients (mean age 72.8 years), of whom 
21.5% underwent elective repair (perioperative mortality 5.1%) after 7.5 years 
of follow-up. Four of six patients diagnosed with AAA rupture were operated 
upon. Relative 5-year survival compared with the general Swedish population, 
controlled for age and sex, was 80.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 70.8-88.8). 
The cost-effectiveness was robust in base-case (11,084 Euro/life year gained) 
and in sensitivity analyses of prevalence, cost and survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in whom AAA was detected at selective screening had 
inferior long-term survival and were operated on less frequently, compared with 
AAA patients described in previous studies. Yet, selective screening at the 
vascular laboratory was cost-effective.

Longevity in mice: is stress resistance a common factor?

Brown-Borg HM(1).

Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, 501 North Columbia Road, Grand 
Forks, ND 58203, USA. brownbrg@medicine.nodak.edu

A positive relationship between stress resistance and longevity has been 
reported in a multitude of studies in organisms ranging from yeast to mice. 
Several mouse lines have been discovered or developed that exhibit extended 
longevities when compared with normal, wild-type mice of the same genetic 
background. These long-living lines include the Ames dwarf, Snell dwarf, growth 
hormone receptor knockout (Laron dwarf), IGF-1 receptor heterozygote, Little, 
alpha-MUPA knockout, p66(shc) knockout, FIRKO, mClk-1 heterozygote, thioredoxin 
transgenic, and most recently the Klotho transgenic mouse. These mice are 
described in terms of the reported extended lifespans and studies involving 
resistance to stress. In addition, caloric restriction (CR) and stress 
resistance are briefly addressed for comparison with genetically altered mice. 
Although many of the long-living mice have GH/IGF-1/insulin signaling-related 
alterations and enhanced stress resistance, there are some that exhibit life 
extension without an obvious link to this hormone pathway. Resistance to 
oxidative stress is by far the most common system studied in long-living mice, 
but there is evidence of enhancement of resistance in other systems as well. The 
differences in stress resistance between long-living mutant and normal mice 
result from complex interrelationships among pathways that appear to coordinate 
signals of growth and metabolism, and subsequently result in differences in 
lifespan.

University, 351 Irvine Hall, Athens, OH 45701, USA. coschigk@ohio.edu

Since generation of the growth hormone receptor/binding protein (GHR/BP) 
gene-disrupted mouse nearly 10 years ago, use of this mouse model has become 
widespread in the elucidation of the physiological roles of GH and insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1). In particular, it serves as a useful model to study 
mechanisms of aging. This review highlights the evidence demonstrating that the 
loss of GH signaling leads to lifespan extension in mice, and presents the 
multiple characteristics of this mouse line that suggest the life extension is 
due to alteration of the aging process.

The possible evidence for an epidemiological transition hypothesis for elderly 
suicides.

and West London Mental Health NHS Trust, London, U.K. ajit.shah@wlmht.nhs.uk

BACKGROUND: An epidemiological transition hypothesis has been developed to 
explain simultaneously wide cross-national variations in elderly suicide rates, 
trends over time for elderly suicide rates and age-associated trends in suicides 
rates. This speculative hypothesis suggests that there is a curvilinear 
(inverted U-shaped curve) relationship between elderly suicide rates and 
socioeconomic status fitting the quadratic equation y = a + bx - cx2 (where y is 
the suicide rate, x is the socioeconomic status, and a, b and c are constants).
METHODS: The predicted curvilinear relationship between elderly suicide rates 
and gross national domestic product (GDP), a measure of socioeconomic status, 
fitting the above quadratic equation was examined with a curve estimation 
regression model using data from the World Health Organization.
RESULTS: The relationship between suicide rates in both sexes in the age-bands 
65-74 and 75+ years and the GDP was curvilinear (inverted U-shaped curve) and 
fitted the above quadratic equation, and was statistically significant (at least 
p<0.05) in all four groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised in accepting this model of the 
epidemiological transition hypothesis for elderly suicide rates because it is 
generated from cross-sectional data using an ecological design. Ideally, this 
model requires rigorous testing by following selected countries of low 
socioeconomic status over time as they develop socioeconomically.

Critical care issues in oncological surgery patients.

Ahmed S(1), Oropello JM.

School of Medicine, 1 Gustave L. Levy Place, New York, NY 10029, USA.

As life expectancy increases and advances in cancer treatment more often convert 
deadly conditions into more chronic diseases, the surgical intensivist can 
expect to be faced with greater numbers of oncology patients undergoing 
aggressive surgical treatments for curative intent, prolonging survival, or 
primarily palliation by alleviating obstruction, infection, bleeding, or pain. 
Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are 
a paradigm for the emerging field of multimodal aggressive oncological surgery. 
This article describes the CRS/HIPEC technique, and discusses the most common 
postoperative complications and critical care issues in these patients, 
including anastomotic leaks, intestinal perforation, abscesses, and 
intra-abdominal bleeding. The leading cause of mortality is sepsis leading to 
multiple organ failure, and such patients are at particularly higher risk due to 
the extensive CRS and HIPEC. The intensivist must be vigilant to ensure that 
source control is not overlooked. This process is a very difficult one, made 
even more challenging by the blunting of physiologic responses and the frequent 
absence of the classic acute abdomen.
