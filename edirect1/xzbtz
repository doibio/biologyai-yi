BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, there has been no overall systematic review 
focusing on the methodological quality of full economic evaluation studies of 
self-management interventions. Our objective was to systematically review the 
literature of full economic evaluation studies of self-management interventions 
in adult chronic patients and to investigate their methodological quality and 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: A data extraction form was developed to assess general and randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) -related characteristics, quality, of the RCTs, economic 
information and quality of the economic evaluation studies by means of a quality 
assessment (CHEC-list for trial-based studies, adjusted CHEC-list for 
model-based studies).
RESULTS: Twenty-three reports were found. Sixteen studies (73 percent) lack 
information on the control intervention(s). Only one study fulfilled all three 
criteria for quality of RCTs and five studies (23 percent) did not meet any of 
these criteria. This review included one model-based study; the other studies 
were trial-based economic evaluation studies based on a RCT. Eight studies (35 
percent) used a societal perspective and 12 (60 percent) synthesized costs and 
effects. Seven studies were categorized into the highest category (<15 score), 
nine studies into the "moderate" group (9-14 score), six studies received a 
"low" score (<8) on the CHEC-list. Eighteen studies found the self-management 
intervention(s) to be cost-effective compared with other interventions 
Conclusions: Self-management interventions for adult chronic patients were 
heterogeneous and there was no clear, well-considered definition of 
self-management. Overall, the methodological quality of the full economic 
evaluation studies was moderate and, therefore, cost-effectiveness results must 
be interpreted with caution. Future research will benefit from further 
improvements in methodological quality of both economic study design and 
analysis, as well as a taxonomy for describing self-management interventions and 
their contents.

In 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations and 
guidance on developing drugs for treatment of skin infection using a new 
definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI). The 
new classification includes cellulitis, erysipelas, major skin abscesses and 
wound infection with a considerable extension of skin involvement, clearly 
referring to a severe subset of skin infections. The main goal of the FDA was to 
better identify specific infections where the advantages of a new antibiotic 
could be precisely estimated through quantifiable parameters, such as 
improvement of the lesion size and of systemic signs of infection. Before the 
spread and diffusion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 
skin infections, antibiotic therapy was relatively straightforward. Using an 
empiric approach, a β-lactam was the preferred therapy and cultures from 
patients were rarely obtained. With the emergence of MRSA in the community 
setting, initial ABSSSI management has been changed and readdressed. 
Dalbavancin, oritavancin and tedizolid are new drugs, approved or in development 
for ABSSSI treatment, that also proved to be efficient against MRSA. Dalbavancin 
and oritavancin have a long half-life and can be dosed less frequently. This in 
turn makes it possible to treat patients with ABSSSI in an outpatient setting, 
avoiding hospitalization or potentially allowing earlier discharge, without 
compromising efficacy. In conclusion, characteristics of long-acting antibiotics 
could represent an opportunity for the management of ABSSSI and could profoundly 
modify the management of these infections by reducing or in some cases 
eliminating both costs and risks of hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: Although treatment of heart failure (HF) patients has improved, 
prognosis still remains poor. Current HF Guidelines recommend communication 
about prognosis with all patients. Little is known about HF patients' awareness 
of their shortened life expectancy.
AIM: To explore HF patients' future expectations and to examine whether these 
expectations are associated with disease severity, quality of life, depressive 
symptoms and clinical outcomes.
METHOD: Patients randomised to the intervention groups of the COACH study, who 
were at the end of HF hospitalisation, were asked about their future 
expectations. Patients were divided into three groups: patients expecting 
improvement/stabilisation, patients expecting deterioration and those not 
knowing what to expect. Depressive symptoms were measured by CES-D and quality 
of life with the Ladder of Life and RAND-36.
RESULTS: Six hundred and seventy eight patients (age 70 ± 12; 41% female 
patients; LVEF 33% ± 15) participated in the study. Most patients (56%, N = 380) 
expected improvement or stabilisation, 8% (N = 55) expected deterioration and 
21% (N = 144) did not know what to expect for the future. Patients who expected 
to deteriorate were significantly older, experienced a lower quality of life and 
more depressive symptoms compared with patients in the other two groups. They 
also had a higher mortality rate, both after 18 and 36 months, and had more HF 
admissions. No association with severity of the disease (NYHA-class, LVEF, BNP 
levels) was found.
CONCLUSION: Many hospitalised HF patients are not aware of their poor prognosis. 
Depressive symptoms, poor quality of life, increased mortality and 
rehospitalisation were related to expected deterioration. Improvement of 
communication about prognosis with HF patients is needed in the future.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common form of inflammatory 
bowel disease in the UK. Medical management aims to induce and maintain 
remission and to avoid complications and the necessity for surgical 
intervention. Colectomy removes the source of inflammation but is associated 
with morbidity and mortality. Newer anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
therapies may improve medical outcomes, albeit at an increased cost.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the incremental cost effectiveness of 
infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab versus conventional therapy and surgery 
from a National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) 
perspective over a lifetime horizon.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed with health states defined according to 
whether the patient is alive or dead, current treatments received, history of 
colectomy and level of disease control. Transition probabilities were derived 
from network meta-analyses (NMAs) of trials of anti-TNF-α agents in the 
moderate-to-severe UC population. Health utilities, colectomy rates, surgical 
complications and resource use estimates were derived from literature. Unit 
costs were drawn from standard costing sources and literature and were valued at 
year 2013/2014 values.
RESULTS: For patients in whom surgery is an option, colectomy is expected to 
dominate all medical treatment options. For patients in whom colectomy is not an 
option, infliximab and golimumab are expected to be ruled out due to dominance, 
whilst the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for adalimumab versus 
conventional treatment is expected to be approximately £50,278 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the NMAs, the ICERs for anti-TNF-α therapy versus 
conventional treatment or surgery are expected to be at best, in excess of 
£50,000 per QALY gained. The cost effectiveness of withdrawing biologic therapy 
upon remission and re-treating relapse is unknown.

OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in incidence, treatment and survival of patients 
with basal cell carcinomas and melanomas of the vulva. Also to compare survival 
of vulvar and cutaneous melanoma patients.
METHODS: All women with a vulvar malignancy between 1989 and 2012 were selected 
from the Dutch Cancer Registry (n=6436). Standardized incidence rates, estimated 
annual percentage change (EAPC) and 5-year relative survival rates were 
calculated for basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and melanomas. Patients with vulvar 
melanomas were matched to women with cutaneous melanomas on period of diagnosis, 
age, Breslow thickness, tumour ulceration, lymph node status and distant 
metastases. Differences in survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and 
the log rank test.
RESULTS: 489 women were diagnosed with a BCC and 350 with a melanoma of the 
vulva. The EAPC in incidence for melanomas was 0.2% and 1.1% for BCCs. 
Eighty-six percent of patients with BCC underwent surgical treatment in 
1989-2006 and 95% in 2005-2012. Forty-five percent with BCC and 79% with 
melanoma were treated in a referral centre. Five-year relative survival for BCCs 
was 100% and for melanomas survival increased from 37% (95%CI 28-47%) in 
1989-1999 to 45% (95%CI: 37-54%) in 2000-2012. Five years after diagnosis 
survival of women with vulvar melanoma was 15% lower compared to matched 
cutaneous melanoma patients (p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: No trends in age-adjusted incidence have been observed but more 
patients with BCC received surgical treatment over time. Having had vulvar BCC 
did not affect life expectancy. Well-known prognostic factors explained most of 
the differences in survival between cutaneous and vulvar melanoma patients, 
however a difference of 15% remained unexplained.

Ivacaftor, a breakthrough treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the 
G551D genetic mutation, lacks long-term clinical and cost projections. This 
study forecasted outcomes and cost by comparing ivacaftor plus usual care versus 
usual care alone.A lifetime Markov model was conducted from a US payer 
perspective. The model consisted of five health states: 1) forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s (FEV1) % pred ≥70%, 2) 40%≤ FEV1 % pred <70%, 3) FEV1 % pred <40%, 
4) lung transplantation and 5) death. All inputs were extracted from published 
literature. Budget impact was also estimated. We estimated ivacaftor's 
improvement in outcomes compared with a non-CF referent population.Ivacaftor was 
associated with 18.25 (95% credible interval (CrI) 13.71-22.20) additional 
life-years and 15.03 (95% CrI 11.13-18.73) additional quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Ivacaftor was associated with improvements in survival and 
QALYs equivalent to 68% and 56%, respectively, for the survival and QALY gaps 
between CF usual care and their non-CF peers. The incremental lifetime cost was 
$3 374 584. The budget impact was $0.087 per member per month.Ivacaftor 
increased life-years and QALYs in CF patients with the G551D mutation, and moved 
morbidity and mortality closer to that of their non-CF peers. Ivacaftor costs 
much more than usual care, but comes at a relatively limited budget impact.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia reduces the quality of life of patients not 
reaching treatment targets.

Author information:

INTRODUCTION: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is the most common monogenic 
disorder associated with premature cardiovascular disease. If untreated, life 
expectancy in heterozygous FH patients is shortened by 20-30 years compared with 
the general population. Nevertheless, treatment goals are only met in 
approximately 50% of patients. This comparative study examined the quality of 
life (QoL) impact of FH in patients who had and had not reached the target of 
treatment.
METHODS: Two qualitative focus group interviews were carried out with a total of 
ten FH patients. A semi-structured interview guide included questions identified 
in a preceding literature study. The data were analysed using a medical 
anthropological approach.
RESULTS: While having FH did not have much impact on well-treated patients' QoL, 
patients who had not reached the treatment target had markedly more concerns. 
They had experienced severe side-effects and worried about their own and their 
relatives' health. They were concerned about the long-term impact of not being 
effectively treated including the risk that coronary heart disease could cause 
their premature death or disability and inability to care for their children, in 
particular. The women had issues with stigma and self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The QoL impact of FH is related to treatment efficacy. These 
findings need to be addressed in the management of FH patients. Particular 
attention should be paid to those who are not presently reaching the target of 
treatment.
FUNDING: The study was funded by a research grant from Amgen.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.

Loss of tooth-supporting structures results in tooth mobility. Increased tooth 
mobility adversely affects function, aesthetics, and the patient's comfort. 
Splints are used to over-come all these problems. When faced with the dilemma of 
how to manage periodontally compromised teeth, splinting of mobile teeth to 
stronger adjacent teeth is a viable option. This prolongs the life expectancy of 
loose teeth, gives stability for the periodontium to reattach, and improves 
comfort, function and aesthetics. Although splinting has been used since ancient 
times, it has been a topic of controversy because of its ill effects on oral 
health, including poor oral hygiene and adverse effects on supporting teeth. 
There have been considerable advancements in the materials used for splinting, 
resulting in fewer ill effects. This article is intended to provide the 
clinicians with an updated overview of splinting, types and classification of 
splints, with their indications, contraindications,rationale and effects on oral 
health.

OBJECTIVE Brain metastases are the most frequent intracranial malignant tumor in 
adults. Surgical intervention for metastases in eloquent areas remains 
controversial and challenging. Even when metastases are not infiltrating 
intra-parenchymal tumors, eloquent areas can be affected. Therefore, this study 
aimed to describe the role of a functional guided approach for the resection of 
brain metastases in the central region. METHODS Thirty-three patients (19 men 
and 14 women) with perirolandic metastases who were treated at the authors' 
institution were reviewed. All participants underwent resection using a 
functional guided approach, which consisted of using intraoperative brain 
mapping and/or neurophysiological monitoring to aid in the resection, depending 
on the functionality of the brain parenchyma surrounding each metastasis. Motor 
and sensory functions were monitored in all patients, and supplementary motor 
and language area functions were assessed in 5 and 4 patients, respectively. 
Clinical data were analyzed at presentation, discharge, and the 6-month 
follow-up. RESULTS The most frequent presenting symptom was seizure, followed by 
paresis. Gross-total removal of the metastasis was achieved in 31 patients 
(93.9%). There were 6 deaths during the follow-up period. After the removal of 
the metastasis, 6 patients (18.2%) presented with transient neurological 
worsening, of whom 4 had worsening of motor function impairment and 2 had 
acquired new sensory disturbances. Total recovery was achieved before the 3rd 
month of follow-up in all cases. Excluding those patients who died due to the 
progression of systemic illness, 88.9% of patients had a Karnofsky Performance 
Scale score greater than 80% at the 6-month follow-up. The mean survival time 
was 24.4 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of intraoperative 
electrical brain stimulation techniques in the resection of central region 
metastases may improve surgical planning and resection and may spare eloquent 
areas. This approach also facilitates maximal resection in these and other 
critical functional areas, thereby helping to avoid new postoperative 
neurological deficits. Avoiding permanent neurological deficits is critical for 
a good quality of life, especially in patients with a life expectancy of over a 
year.

To investigate a potential extension of a partial life cycle test protocol to a 
full life cycle test design, a comparative sensitivity analysis with juvenile 
and adult Potamopyrgus antipodarum was performed. Neonates and adult snails were 
exposed to the metal cadmium (Cd) and the endocrine disruptor tributyltin (TBT) 
at nominal concentrations ranging from 1.56 to 50 μg Cd/L and from 25 to 
1,000 ng TBT-Sn/L. The experiments were performed over 28 days at 16°C in a 
semi-static test design. Mortality was assessed for both life stages. Juvenile 
snails' specific growth rate and reproduction of adults were investigated as 
main endpoints. We determined effects on snails' survival, juvenile growth and 
embryo numbers in the brood pouch of adult snails under exposure to both 
chemicals. Juvenile control mortality was between 25% and 30% and significantly 
higher than in the control groups with adult snails. A higher sensitivity of 
juvenile snails compared to adults was observed for the endpoint mortality. 
Calculated LC50 in Cd exposed snails was 38.2 μg/L for adults and 15.0 μg/L for 
juvenile snails. Significant effects on mortality in TBT exposed adult snails 
occurred at the highest test concentration only with a LC50 of 535 ng Sn/L. 
Juvenile survival was significantly affected at 50.8 ng Sn/L and higher 
concentrations. Effect concentrations for the main endpoints reproduction and 
juvenile growth show comparable sensitivities. For Cd exposed groups, EC50 
values were 11.3 μg/L for the endpoint reproduction in adult snails and 3.82 
μg/L for juvenile growth with overlapping confidence intervals. TBT also 
significantly affected juvenile snails' growth (EC50: 178 ng Sn /L). EC50 for 
embryo numbers was 125 ng TBT-Sn/L. Results indicate the manageability of a FLC 
test starting with newly hatched snails. Precautions have to be taken to 
guarantee a sufficient number of surviving snails until adulthood so that 
reproduction can be assessed. For final decision for the practicability of a 
FLC, further tests are needed.

BACKGROUND: The methods currently available to estimate age- and sex-specific 
mortality rates for sub-populations are subject to a number of important 
limitations. We propose two alternative multivariable approaches: a relational 
model and a Poisson model both using restricted cubic splines.
METHODS: We evaluated a flexible Poisson and flexible relational model against 
the Elandt-Johnson approach in a simulation study using 100 random samples of 
population and death counts, with different sampling proportions and data 
arrangements. Estimated rates were compared to the original mortality rates 
using goodness-of-fit measures and life expectancy. We further investigated an 
approach for determining optimal knot locations in the Poisson model.
RESULTS: The flexible Poisson model outperformed the flexible relational and 
Elandt-Johnson methods with the smallest sample of data (1%). With the largest 
sample of data (20%), the flexible Poisson and flexible relational models 
performed comparably, though the flexible Poisson model displayed a slight 
advantage. Both approaches tended to underestimate infant mortality and thereby 
overestimate life expectancy at birth. The flexible Poisson model performed much 
better at young ages when knots were fixed a priori. For ages 30 and above, 
results were similar to the model with no fixed knots.
CONCLUSIONS: The flexible Poisson model is recommended because it derives robust 
and unbiased estimates for sub-populations without making strong assumptions 
about age-specific mortality profiles. Fixing knots a priori in the final model 
greatly improves fit at the young ages.

PURPOSE: Adequate reporting of time-related patient characteristics is needed 
for research findings to be properly interpreted, applied, and reproduced. Our 
objective was to characterize the time-related patient characteristics in 
palliative oncology studies and to examine the differences in time-related 
patient characteristics by various study characteristics.
METHODS: We extracted time-related patient characteristics including actual 
survival, performance status, cancer stage, disease trajectory, study setting, 
and eligibility criteria (life expectancy and performance status) from an 
established cohort of original palliative oncology articles published in 2004 
and 2009.
RESULTS: Among 742 original articles, 409 (55 %) were case series. Only 247 
(33 %) articles reported actual survival, 157 (21 %) reported actual performance 
status, 362 (49 %) cancer stage, and 392 (53 %) reported study setting. Based on 
all the available time-related characteristics, we were able to classify the 
studies into specific time-related categories in 378 (51 %) studies. Among 
these, only 47 (13 %) focused on patients in the last month of life. Compared to 
studies involving patients earlier in the disease trajectory, these studies were 
more likely to be case series (81 vs. 56 %, P = 0.005), retrospective (64 vs. 
49 %, P = 0.03), and had a smaller sample size (median 20 vs. 61, P = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of studies did not adequately report time-related 
patient characteristics. We also identified a gap in both the quantity and 
quality of studies involving patients in the last month of life. Our study has 
implications for study reporting and future directions for palliative oncology 
research.

Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) by thoracoscopy after neoadjuvant therapy 
results in significant short-term advantages such as a lower incidence of 
pulmonary infections and a better quality of life (QoL) with the same 
completeness of resection. After 1 year, a better QoL is still observed for MIE 
in comparison with the open approach, while having the same survival. Seven 
issues about implementation of MIE for cancer require discussion: (1) choice of 
the extension of esophageal resection and use of neoadjuvant therapy; (2) 
reasons to approach the esophageal cancer by MIE; (3) determining the best 
minimally invasive approach for gastro-esophageal junction cancers; (4) 
implementation of evidence-based MIE; (5) standardization of the surgical 
anatomy of the esophagus based on MIE; (6) future lines of research of MIE; and 
(7) learning process. In the time of imaging-integrated surgery it is clear that 
the MIE approach should be increasingly implemented in all centers worldwide 
having an adequate volume of patients and expertise.

Nutrition has profound effects on ageing and lifespan. Caloric restriction is 
the major nutritional intervention that historically has been shown to influence 
lifespan and/or healthspan in many animal models. Studies have suggested that a 
reduction in protein intake can also increase lifespan, albeit not as 
dramatically as caloric restriction. More recent research based on nutritional 
geometry has attempted to define the effects of nutrition on ageing over a broad 
landscape of dietary macronutrients and energy content. Such studies in insects 
and mice indicate that animals with ad libitum access to low-protein, 
high-carbohydrate diets have longest lifespans. Remarkably, the optimum content 
and ratio of dietary protein to carbohydrates for ageing in experimental animals 
are almost identical to those in the traditional diets of the long-lived people 
on the island of Okinawa.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and other chronic cardio-metabolic conditions are 
significant contributors to the large disparities in life expectancy between 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent 
from a young age among Indigenous Australians and is often preceded by a cluster 
of risk factors, including central obesity, dyslipidaemia, albuminuria and 
socio-economic disadvantage. Management of type 2 diabetes in Australian 
Indigenous peoples can be challenging in the setting of limited resources and 
socio-economic disadvantage. Key strategies to address these challenges include 
working in partnership with patients, communities and primary healthcare 
services (PHC, Aboriginal community controlled and government services) and 
working in a multidisciplinary team. Population prevention measures are required 
within and beyond the health system, commencing as early as possible in the life 
course.

PURPOSE: To describe an economic (Ec) model for estimating the impact of 
screening and treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
DESIGN: EcROP is a cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit analysis.
METHODS: We surveyed caregivers of 52 children at schools for the blind or 
pediatric eye clinics in Atlanta, Georgia and 43 in Mexico City. A decision 
analytic model with sensitivity analysis determined the incremental 
cost-effectiveness (primary outcome) and incremental monetary benefit (secondary 
outcome) of an ideal (100% screening) national ROP program as compared to 
estimates of current practice. Direct costs included screening and treatment 
expenditures. Indirect costs estimated lost productivity of caretaker(s) and 
blind individuals as determined by face-to-face surveys. Utility and 
effectiveness were measured in quality-adjusted life years and benefit in US 
dollars. EcROP includes a sensitivity analysis to assesses the incremental 
cost-effectiveness and societal impact of ROP screening and treatment within a 
country or economic region. Estimates are based on evidence-based clinical data 
and region-specific economic data acquired from direct field survey.
RESULTS: In both Mexico and the United States, an ideal national ROP screening 
and treatment program was highly cost-saving. The incremental net benefit of an 
ideal ROP program over current practice is $5556 per child ($206 574 333 
annually) and $3628 per child ($205 906 959 annually) in Mexico and the United 
States, respectively.
CONCLUSION: EcROP demonstrates that ROP screening and treatment is highly 
beneficial for quality of life, cost saving, and cost-effectiveness in the 
United States and Mexico. EcROP can be applied to any country or region to 
provide data for informed allocation of limited health care resources.

PURPOSE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine whether 
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a cost-effective therapy compared 
with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with unresectable colorectal 
cancer (CRC) liver metastases.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a 
Markov model and 1-month cycle over a lifetime horizon. Transition 
probabilities, quality of life utilities, and costs associated with SBRT and RFA 
were captured in the model on the basis of a comprehensive literature review and 
Medicare reimbursements in 2014. Strategies were compared using the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, with effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). To account for model uncertainty, 1-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed. Strategies were evaluated with a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: In base case analysis, treatment costs for 3 fractions of SBRT and 1 
RFA procedure were $13,000 and $4397, respectively. Median survival was assumed 
the same for both strategies (25 months). The SBRT costs $8202 more than RFA 
while gaining 0.05 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of $164,660 per QALY gained. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, results were most 
sensitive to variation of median survival from both treatments. Stereotactic 
body radiation therapy was economically reasonable if better survival was 
presumed (>1 month gain) or if used for large tumors (>4 cm).
CONCLUSIONS: If equal survival is assumed, SBRT is not cost-effective compared 
with RFA for inoperable colorectal liver metastases. However, if better local 
control leads to small survival gains with SBRT, this strategy becomes 
cost-effective. Ideally, these results should be confirmed with prospective 
comparative data.

PURPOSE: Create a cost-effectiveness model comparing preoperative intensity 
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) versus 3-dimensional conformal radiation 
therapy (3DCRT) for extremity soft tissue sarcomas.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Input parameters included 5-year local recurrence rates, 
rates of acute wound adverse events, and chronic toxicities (edema, fracture, 
joint stiffness, and fibrosis). Health-state utilities were used to calculate 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Overall treatment costs per QALY or 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. Roll-back analysis 
was performed using average costs and utilities to determine the baseline 
preferred radiation technique. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (PSA) were performed for input parameters with the largest impact on 
the ICER.
RESULTS: Overall treatment costs were $17,515.58 for 3DCRT compared with 
$22,920.51 for IMRT. The effectiveness was higher for IMRT (3.68 QALYs) than for 
3DCRT (3.35 QALYs). The baseline ICER for IMRT was $16,842.75/QALY, making it 
the preferable treatment. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of 
local recurrence, upfront radiation costs, local recurrence costs, certain 
utilities (no toxicity/no recurrence, grade 1 toxicity/no local recurrence, 
grade 4 toxicity/no local recurrence), and life expectancy. Dominance patterns 
emerged when the cost of 3DCRT exceeded $15,532.05 (IMRT dominates) or the life 
expectancy was under 1.68 years (3DCRT dominates). Furthermore, preference 
patterns changed based on the rate of local recurrence (threshold: 13%). The PSA 
results demonstrated that IMRT was the preferred cost-effective technique for 
64% of trials compared with 36% for 3DCRT.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our model, IMRT is the preferred technique by lowering 
rates of local recurrence, severe toxicities, and improving QALYs. From a 
third-party payer perspective, IMRT should be a supported approach for extremity 
soft tissue sarcomas.

The purpose of this study is to document and explain secular trends in stature 
among Northern Jordanian men and women between the years of birth 1960 and 1990, 
as they relate to overall per capita socio-economic improvement, the stature of 
360 adults from two Northern governorates, those of Jerash and Irbid, was 
measured. General linear model (GLM) was used to examine the effect of 
birth-decade, education level of subject, and their interaction on mean stature 
of each sex separately. GLM results revealed that women who were born during the 
following three decades pooled together (1951-1980) did not differ significantly 
in mean stature from those born during (1981-1990). Among men, stature of those 
born in the two pooled birth-decades together (1951-1970) did not significantly 
differ of those were born in the two pooled birth-decades (1971-1990).

OBJECTIVES: To compare the agreement and rates of cancer screening using four 
prognostic tools that require different types of clinical information.
DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: 2009 and 2010 waves of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 66-90 with survey and claims data (N = 9,469).
MEASUREMENTS: Agreement between four indices predicting short-term (4-5 years) 
and long-term (9-10 years) survival; self-reported breast and prostate cancer 
screening.
RESULTS: Agreement between the four prognostic tools was high. Pearson 
correlation coefficients ranged from 0.63 to 0.90 for short-term survival and 
0.68 to 0.94 for long-term survival. When defining limited short-term life 
expectancy as less than 25% chance of surviving 4 or 5 years, all four tools 
agreed in 96.4% of the sample. All four tools agreed in their placement of 
participants into limited or not-limited long-term life expectancy in 77.1% of 
participants (<25% chance of surviving 9 or 10 years). Rates of cancer screening 
were similarly high in individuals with limited long-term life expectancy 
regardless of the tool used: greater than 31% for mammographic screening in 
women and greater than 69% for prostate cancer screening.
CONCLUSION: There is substantial agreement among different prognostic tools for 
short- and long-term survival in Medicare beneficiaries. The high rates of 
cancer screening of individuals with limited life expectancy suggest the 
importance of incorporating tools into clinical decision-making.

With widespread and effective antiretroviral therapy, the life expectancy in the 
HIV population has dramatically improved over the last two decades. 
Consequently, as patients are aging with HIV, other age-related comorbidities, 
such as metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disease (CVD), have emerged as 
important causes of morbidity and mortality. An overrepresentation of 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors (RF), toxicities associated with long 
exposure to antiretroviral therapy, together with residual chronic inflammation 
and immune activation associated with HIV infection are thought to predispose to 
these metabolic complications and to the excess risk of CVD observed in the HIV 
population. The metabolic syndrome (MS) represents a clustering of RF for CVD 
that includes abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin 
resistance. Hypertension is a prevalent feature of the MS in HIV, in particular 
in the aging population, and constitutes an important RF for CVD. Physicians 
should screen their patients for metabolic and cardiovascular risk at the 
regular visits to reduce MS and the associated CVD risk among people aging with 
HIV, since many of RF are under-diagnosed and under-treated conditions. 
Interventions to reduce these RF can include lifestyle changes and 
pharmacological interventions such as antihypertensive and lipid-lowering 
therapy, and treatment of glucose metabolism disturbances. Changes in 
antiretroviral therapy to more metabolic neutral antiretroviral drugs may also 
be considered.
