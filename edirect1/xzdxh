Acinetobacter, Shivalella, and Flavobacterium decreased, suggesting that 
intestinal microbiota may play an important role in host response to heat 
stress. These results are consistent with previously reported results that the 
survival rate of both male and female P. canaliculata no longer significantly 
reduced after 21 days of high temperature stress, suggesting that the surviving 
P. canaliculata had gradually adapted to high temperature environments under 
long-term high temperature stress.

INTRODUCTION: Media guidelines for the responsible reporting of suicide are a 
recognized universal suicide prevention intervention. While implemented in 
numerous countries, including Australia, little is known about whether they are 
cost-effective. We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of Mindframe, the 
national initiative implementing media guidelines in Australia.
METHOD: We conducted a modelled economic evaluation (5-year time-horizon) 
incorporating two types of economic analysis: (i) return-on-investment (ROI) 
comparing estimated cost savings from the intervention to the total intervention 
cost, and (ii) cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the net intervention costs 
to health outcomes: suicide deaths prevented and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). We also included uncertainty analyses to propagate parameter 
uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the model outputs 
to changes in input parameters and assumptions.
RESULTS: The estimated ROI ratio for the main analysis was 94:1 (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI]: 37 to 170). The intervention was associated with cost savings of 
A$596M (95% UI: A$228M to A$1,081M), 139 (95% UI: 55 to 252) suicides prevented 
and 107 (95% UI: 42 to 192) QALYs gained. The intervention was dominant, or 
cost-saving, compared with no intervention with results being robust to 
sensitivity analysis but varying based on the conservativeness of the parameters 
entered.
CONCLUSION: Mindframe was found to be cost-saving, and therefore, worthy of 
investment and inclusion as part of national suicide prevention strategies.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the burden of disease of chronic pain in Colombia.
METHODS: We estimated disability adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to 
chronic pain using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) method. We identified 
diagnostic codes related to chronic pain considering lumbar pain, 
osteoarthritis, post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, cancer-related 
pain, and others. We estimated the prevalent cases by sex and age-group using 
local administrative databases and literature. We assumed that pain would not 
cause premature death, so we only estimated years lived with disability using 
disability weights obtained from the GBD. We used a prevalence-based approach, 
without discounting or age-group adjustment. We calculated total DALYs and 
DALYs/100,000 inhabitants.
RESULTS: We estimated a total of 5,545,019 patients with chronic pain. We 
calculated 491,626 DALYs or 976 DALYs/100,000 inhabitants attributable to 
chronic pain. Low back pain, osteoarthritis, and cancer-related pain were the 
most important groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study estimates that chronic pain contributes a significant 
quantity of DALYs, especially related to low back pain, osteoarthritis, and 
cancer-related pain. Chronic pain should be considered in the public health 
agenda.

Obesity paradoxes have been reported in many diseases to date. As the wording 
"paradox" indicates, our intuition rejects the hypothesis that obese people have 
a better life expectancy or fewer cardiovascular events. One of the most 
plausible explanations for the obesity paradox is collider bias, but controversy 
about this is ongoing. If the findings of the original research are affected by 
collider bias, meta-analyses of that research will also be affected by the same 
bias. It is to be hoped that the use of appropriate analytical techniques will 
enable the true nature of the obesity bias to become clear.

OBJECTIVES: Migration and gender are important factors that differentiate the 
Latino immigrant experience in the United States. We investigate the association 
between nativity status, age of migration, and cognitive life expectancies among 
a nationally representative sample of Latino adults aged 50 and older to explore 
whether age of migration and gender influence cognitive aging across the life 
course.
METHODS: This study used data from the Health and Retirement Study (1998-2016) 
to estimate Sullivan-based life tables of cognitive life expectancies by 
nativity, age of migration, and gender for older Latino adults. Cognitive status 
was based on the Langa-Weir algorithm. We test for both within-group (i.e., 
nativity and age of migration) and gender differences to explore the overall 
burden of disease among this rapidly growing population.
RESULTS: Foreign-born Latinos, regardless of age of migration or gender, spend a 
greater number of years after age 50 with cognitive impairment/no dementia than 
U.S.-born Latinos. However, the number of years spent with dementia varied by 
subgroup with midlife immigrant men and late-life immigrant men and women 
exhibiting a significant disadvantage relative to the U.S.-born. Furthermore, we 
document a gender disadvantage for all Latino women, regardless of immigrant 
status.
DISCUSSION: The robust relationship between nativity, age of migration, and 
cognitive aging suggests that older foreign-born Latinos experiencing cognitive 
decline may place serious burdens on families. Future research should target the 
needs of different subgroups of older Latinos who are entering their last 
decades of life to develop culturally appropriate long-term care programs.

Radiopharmaceuticals are radioactive drugs, with a very short shelf life, in 
most of the cases. The number of proceedings using radiopharmaceuticals 
increases each day worldwide and for many countries the price of 
radiopharmaceuticals can represent a limitation in the offer of this drug for 
more patients. Nonetheless, the shortage of important radionuclides is a serious 
issue and may also affect the use and distribution of these drugs for more 
patients globally, especially in low and middle income countries. In this 
direction, the need to avoid waste of these drugs is crucial. In this study we 
have evaluated the stability of two radiopharmaceuticals (MDP and DTPA) under 
different conditions in order to propose the extension of shelf life. The 
results showed that is possible to have stable radiopharmaceuticals (both MDP 
and DTPA) even 24hs post labeling process when storage properly. The data may 
represent an advance in the field of Radiopharmacy, providing news perspectives 
for radiopharmaceuticals shelf life.

Standard laboratory tests to describe the impact of stressors (most notably: 
chemicals) on organisms offer a good compromise between feasibility and outcome, 
i.e., they should be reproducible and provide robust results. However, these 
tests may underestimate the potential effects of prolonged exposures, 
particularly for persistent contaminants. Within the last years, we have 
observed an increase in studies aiming to target prolonged exposure, e.g., via 
an extended test duration or by multigenerational (MG) exposure. Seemingly, both 
reduced and increased impacts have been observed in these studies, but it is 
also clear that no unique test setup was used, and test designs vary widely 
among studies. To better describe long term effects, MG is a highly relevant 
aspect which deserves more consideration at various testing and assessment 
levels. Therefore, we conducted a literature review focusing on available 
studies performed with soil invertebrates, exposed to stressors for periods 
longer than in standard laboratory tests, i.e., full life cycle tests, as well 
as extensions to standard and MG tests. So far, it has been recommended that 
such studies should cover more than one generation, but this statement is 
probably too vague. In this contribution, we summarize and critically discuss 
the information provided in the literature, and we provide suggestions for 
future research. The currently available test results from long-term studies 
have produced clear evidence to recommend the implementation of long-term tests 
in existing regulatory testing requirements (e.g., for pesticides), in 
particular for persistent substances and also for delayed effects. Consequently, 
we recommend the inclusion of such longer exposure test designs (e.g., as 
annexes) in current OECD and ISO guidelines. However, when doing so, the 
long-term test designs proposed so far have to be critically adapted for a 
selected set of representative soil invertebrate test species.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) varies 
considerably both within and between countries. The objective of this study was 
to compare survival among countries with single-payer healthcare systems while 
accounting for markers of disease severity.
METHODS: This cohort study used data from established national CF registries in 
Australia, Canada, France and New Zealand from 2015 to 2019. Median age of 
survival for each of the four countries was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare risk of death 
between Canada, France and Australia after adjusting for prognostic factors. Due 
to low number of deaths, New Zealand was not included in final adjusted models.
RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 14 842 people (3537 Australia, 4434 
Canada, 6411 France and 460 New Zealand) were included. The median age of 
survival was highest in France 65.9 years (95% CI: 59.8 to 76.0) versus 53.3 
years (95% CI: 48.9 to 59.8) for Australia, 55.4 years (95% CI: 51.3 to 59.2) 
for Canada and 54.8 years (95% CI: 40.7 to not available) for New Zealand. After 
adjusting for individual-level factors, the risk of death was significantly 
higher in Canada (HR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.32; p<0.001) and Australia (HR 
2.08, 95% CI: 1.64 to 2.64; p<0.001) versus France.
INTERPRETATION: We observed significantly higher survival in France compared 
with countries with single-payer healthcare systems. The median age of survival 
in France exceeded 60 years of age despite having the highest proportion of 
underweight patients which may be due to differences in availability of 
transplant.

INTRODUCTION: Eating disorders cause suffering and a high risk of death. 
Accelerating the translation of research into implementation will require 
intervention cost-effectiveness estimates. The objective of this study was to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of 5 public health approaches to preventing 
eating disorders among adolescents and young adults.
METHODS: Using data from 2001 to 2017, the authors developed a microsimulation 
model of a closed cohort starting at the age of 10 years and ending at 40 years. 
In 2021, an analysis was conducted of 5 primary and secondary prevention 
strategies for eating disorders: school-based screening, primary care‒based 
screening, school-based universal prevention, excise tax on over-the-counter 
diet pills, and restriction on youth purchase of over-the-counter diet pills. 
The authors estimated the reduction in years lived with eating disorders and the 
increase in quality-adjusted life-years. Intervention costs and net monetary 
benefit were estimated using a threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year.
RESULTS: All the 5 interventions were estimated to be cost-saving compared with 
the current practice. Discounted per person cost savings (over the 30-year 
analytic time horizon) ranged from $63 (clinic screening) to $1,102 
(school-based universal prevention). Excluding caregiver costs for binge eating 
disorder and otherwise specified feeding and eating disorders substantially 
reduced cost savings (e.g., from $1,102 to $149 for the school-based 
intervention).
CONCLUSIONS: A range of public health strategies to reduce the societal burden 
of eating disorders are likely cost saving. Universal prevention interventions 
that promote healthy nutrition, physical activity, and media use behaviors 
without introducing weight stigma may prevent additional negative health 
outcomes, such as excess weight gain.

Plant-deleterious microbial volatiles activate the transactivation of hypoxia, 
MAMPs and wound responsive genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. AtMKK1 and AtMKK3 are 
involved in the plant-deleterious microbial volatiles-induced defense responses. 
Microbial volatile compounds (mVCs) are a collection of volatile metabolites 
from microorganisms with biological effects on all living organisms. mVCs 
function as gaseous modulators of plant growth and plant health. In this study, 
the defense events induced by plant-deleterious mVCs were investigated. 
Enterobacter aerogenes VCs lead to growth inhibition and immune responses in 
Arabidopsis thaliana. E. aerogenes VCs negatively regulate auxin response and 
transport gene expression in the root tip, as evidenced by decreased expression 
of DR5::GFP, PIN3::PIN3-GFP and PIN4::PIN4-GFP. Data from transcriptional 
analysis suggests that E. aerogenes VCs trigger hypoxia response, innate immune 
responses and metabolic processes. In addition, the transcript levels of the 
genes involved in the synthetic pathways of antimicrobial metabolites camalexin 
and coumarin are increased after the E. aerogenes VCs exposure. Moreover, we 
demonstrate that MKK1 serves as a regulator of camalexin biosynthesis gene 
expression in response to E. aerogenes VCs, while MKK3 is the regulator of 
coumarin biosynthesis gene expression. Additionally, MKK1 and MKK3 mediate the 
E. aerogenes VCs-induced callose deposition. Collectively, these studies provide 
molecular insights into immune responses by plant-deleterious mVCs.

BACKGROUND: This paper reports on the cost-effectiveness evaluation of Link-me - 
a digitally supported, systematic approach to triaging care for depression and 
anxiety in primary care that uses a patient-completed Decision Support Tool 
(DST).
METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a parallel, stratified 
individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing prognosis-matched care 
to usual care at six- and 12-month follow-up. Twenty-three general practices in 
three Australian Primary Health Networks recruited 1,671 adults (aged 18 - 
75 years), predicted by the DST to have minimal/mild or severe depressive or 
anxiety symptoms in three months. The minimal/mild prognostic group was referred 
to low intensity services. Participants screened in the severe prognostic group 
were offered high intensity care navigation, a model of care coordination. The 
outcome measures included in this evaluation were health sector costs (including 
development and delivery of the DST, care navigation and other healthcare 
services used) and societal costs (health sector costs plus lost productivity), 
psychological distress [Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)] and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the EuroQol 5-dimension quality of life 
questionnaire with Australian general population preference weights applied. 
Costs were valued in 2018-19 Australian dollars (A$).
RESULTS: Across all participants, the health sector incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Link-me per point decrease in K10 at six 
months was estimated at $1,082 (95% CI $391 to $6,204) increasing to $2,371 (95% 
CI $191 to Dominated) at 12 months. From a societal perspective, the ICER was 
estimated at $1,257/K10 point decrease (95% CI Dominant to Dominated) at six 
months, decreasing to $1,217 (95% CI Dominant to Dominated) at 12 months. No 
significant differences in QALYs were detected between trial arms and the 
intervention was dominated (less effective, more costly) based on the cost/QALY 
ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: The Link-me approach to stepped mental health care would not be 
considered cost-effective utilising a cost/QALY outcome metric commonly adopted 
by health technology assessment agencies. Rather, Link-me showed a trend toward 
cost-effectiveness by providing improvement in mental health symptoms, measured 
by the K10, at an additional cost.

INTRODUCTION: Adherence to medication regimens is essential to decrease 
morbidity/mortality and increase life expectancy among HIV positive persons on 
Highly Active Anti-retroviral Therapy (HAART). This study was born in response 
to the absence of information regarding access and adherence to HAART among 
refugee and asylum seekers in urban, irregular, transit country settings.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to understand the barriers and facilitators to HIV 
medication adherence among refugees and asylum seekers living with HIV and to 
generate novel recommendations to facilitate adherence.
METHODS: Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 34 refugees and 
asylum seeks to explore their lived experiences. Interviews were structured 
around the social ecological model to capture influences of multiple levels. 
Thematic analysis was conducted on transcripts.
RESULTS: Stigma, lack of knowledge and language barriers were among the main 
barriers noted by refugees and asylum-seekers in relation to HIV medication 
adherence, whereas interpersonal relationships, improved health, and strong 
patient-physician relationships were seen as facilitators. Participants noted 
their desire for community-support groups, education, and increased use of 
interpreters in order to combat some of the social barriers preventing full HIV 
medication adherence.
CONCLUSION: A regular status shapes participants' adherence to HIV medications. 
Group-based interventions to support refugees are needed.

Down's syndrome (DS) is the most well-known chromosomal abnormality 
characterized by an extra chromosome 21 and multiple systemic issues. The higher 
production of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor peptide of 
beta-amyloid, predisposes persons with DS to early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
prevalence of dementia has increased as a function of the extended life 
expectancy of persons with DS. Because we know little about the treatment of 
dementia in persons with DS, this review focuses on the pathophysiology and 
management strategies to improve the overall quality of life.

Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is an oncologic emergency of venous congestion 
due to impaired venous flow through the SVC to the right atrium, leading to 
potential hemodynamic instability. We report a case of a 78-year-old female 
patient with a non-symptomatic lung nodule that exhibited rapid growth from its 
discovery to an enlarging tumor impinging the SVC in less than one month. The 
short time span from computed tomography (CT) image of the tumor to oncologic 
emergency required our team to act quickly to identify the source of the tumor 
and halt its progression, utilizing a multidisciplinary team approach while 
dealing with a patient that executed their right of autonomy to refusal of care, 
thus focusing on management with palliative goals since SVC syndrome has a life 
expectancy of six months post-diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer screening is a means of detecting cervical cancer 
early, before it develops, in order to reduce disease mortality and morbidity. 
When women are screened for cervical cancer between the ages of 30 and 40 years 
at least one time in their life, their risk of cancer could be decreased by 
25-36%. Despite this advantage, cervical cancer screening coverage in Ethiopia 
is still <2%. As a result, we wanted to see how ready women in the Girar Jarso 
district, Ethiopia, were to get a cervical cancer test.
METHODOLOGY: Community-based cross-sectional study was done using a stratified 
cluster sampling technique among 855 women aged 30-65 years in the Girar Jarso 
district, Ethiopia, from 1 June 2021 to 1 September 2021. A pretested and 
semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the 
data. EpiData management version 4.6 was used to enter data, which was then 
exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was 
performed, and variables with a p-value of <0.05 were taken as statistically 
significant predictors of the willingness to utilize cervical cancer screening.
RESULTS: Of the 855 women, only 315 (46.7%, CI = 43-50.3) women were willing to 
be checked for cervical cancer, with 181 (21.2%) women having been screened at 
least one time in their life. Age of 30-39 years [AOR = 2.80 (95% CI: 1.05, 
7.48)], urban resident [AOR = 2.12 (95% CI: 1.06, 4.48)], positive attitude [AOR 
= 1.68 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.53)], wealth status, awareness of cervical cancer, and 
low perceived barriers were independent predictors of the willingness to utilize 
cervical cancer screening.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The willingness to utilize cervical cancer 
screening services is low in the Girar Jarso district. To improve community 
awareness and attitude, continued and sustainable advocacy on the value of 
cervical cancer screening should be offered through mass media and health 
extension workers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the meniscus characteristics of knee osteoarthritis 
and its guiding significance for minimally invasive surgery.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients with knee meniscus sports injuries who were 
treated in our hospital from January 2019 to January 2022 were selected as the 
research subjects and were grouped according to the interval between injury and 
surgery, with an interval of 2 months: the early group (53 cases) within 2 
months and the delayed group (47 cases) with an interval of more than 2 months. 
The distribution of intraoperative complications in the two groups was observed 
and recorded, and the changes in pain degree, joint range of motion, knee joint 
function, and quality of life scores before and after operation were compared 
between the two groups.
RESULTS: The postoperative VAS score, range of motion, Lysholm score, IKDC knee 
subjective function score, and quality of life score were significantly improved 
in both groups (P < 0.05). The incidence of intra-articular cartilage injury in 
the delayed group was significantly higher than that in the early group (P < 
0.05). The patellofemoral cartilage injury was the main part of intra-articular 
cartilage injury in the two groups, and the incidence of patellofemoral 
cartilage injury in the delayed group was significantly higher than that in the 
early group (P < 0.05). The cartilage damage was mainly cartilage damage, and 
the grades I-II and III-IV cartilage damages were significantly increased in the 
extension group.
CONCLUSION: Meniscal injury in knee osteoarthritis has certain microscopic 
characteristics. In this paper, the microscopic classification of meniscus 
injury in knee osteoarthritis is helpful to guide microscopic surgery and 
improve the minimally invasive knee osteoarthritis effect of surgical treatment.

The RAS/MAPK pathway is a highly conserved signalling pathway with a 
well-established role in cancer. Mutations that hyperactivate this pathway are 
associated with unregulated cell proliferation. Evidence from a range of model 
organisms also links RAS/MAPK signalling to ageing. Genetic approaches that 
reduce RAS/MAPK signalling activity extend lifespan and also improve healthspan, 
delaying the onset and/or progression of age-related functional decline. Given 
its role in cancer, therapeutic interventions that target and inhibit this 
pathway's key components are under intense investigation. The consequent 
availability of small molecule inhibitors raises the possibility of repurposing 
these compounds to ameliorate the deleterious effects of ageing. Here, we review 
evidence that RAS/MAPK signalling inhibitors already in clinical use, such as 
trametinib, acarbose, statins, metformin and dihydromyricetin, lead to lifespan 
extension and to improved healthspan in a range of model systems. These findings 
suggest that the repurposing of small molecule inhibitors of RAS/MAPK signalling 
might offer opportunities to improve health during ageing, and to delay or 
prevent the development of age-related disease. However, challenges to this 
approach, including poor tolerance to treatment in older adults or development 
of drug resistance, first need to be resolved before successful clinical 
implementation.

OBJECTIVE: After temozolomide failure, no evidence-based treatment is available 
for pituitary carcinomas (PCs) and aggressive pituitary tumors (APTs). To date, 
only 12 cases treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been 
published, showing encouraging efficacy. Predictive factors of response are 
lacking. Here, we aimed to assess the real-life efficacy and predictors of 
response to ICIs in PCs and APTs.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a multicentric, retrospective, observational 
cohort study, including all PCs and APTs treated with ICIs in France up to March 
2022. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry and CD8+ T cell infiltration were evaluated 
centrally.
RESULTS: Six PCs (four corticotroph and two lactotroph) and nine APTs (five 
corticotroph and four lactotroph) were included. The real-life efficacy of ICIs 
was lower than previously published data. Three corticotroph tumors (33.3%) 
showed partial response, one (11.1%) stable disease, while five (55.6%) 
progressed. One lactotroph tumor (16.7%) showed partial response, one (16.7%) 
stable disease, while four (66.7%) progressed. PCs responded far better than 
APTs, with 4/6 PCs showing partial response compared to 0/9 APTs. Corticotroph 
tumors responded slightly better than lactotroph tumors. In the four responsive 
corticotroph tumors, PD-L1 staining was negative and CD8+ T cell infiltration 
attained a maximum of 1% in the tumor center.
CONCLUSIONS: Confirmation of the presence or absence of metastases is necessary 
before starting ICIs. After temozolomide failure, ICIs appear as a good 
therapeutic option for PCs, especially for corticotroph carcinomas. Negative 
PD-L1 staining and very low CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor center should 
not preclude ICI administration in corticotroph carcinomas.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first study to assess the real-life efficacy 
of ICIs in pituitary carcinomas (PCs) and aggressive pituitary tumors. We also 
assessed potential predictors of response and are the first to assess the 
predictive value of CD8+ cell infiltration. We identified the tumor type as a 
major predictor, ICIs proving far more effective in treating PCs. Our study 
provides evidence that ICIs are a good option after temozolomide failure for PCs 
(four of six responded), especially for corticotroph carcinomas (three of four 
responded). We also provide evidence that negative PD-L1 staining and very low 
CD8+ cell infiltration in the tumor center should not preclude ICI 
administration in corticotroph carcinomas. Moreover, our findings point toward 
the need to systematically perform extension workup before starting ICIs.

BACKGROUND: The cost effectiveness of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezo-beva) 
versus nivolumab treatment for advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma 
is still uncertain. In this study, the cost effectiveness of these treatments 
was assessed in the United States.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis integrating a network meta-analysis 
framework was performed using data from the IMbrave150 (ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier NCT03434379) and CheckMate 459 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier 
NCT02576509) trials. In total, 1244 patients were enrolled. A partitioned 
survival model was used to evaluate cost effectiveness. A deterministic one-way 
sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were further 
performed to evaluate model robustness. Subgroup analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: Compared with the outcomes using nivolumab, the hazard ratio (HR) for 
overall survival with atezo-beva was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48-0.98), and the HR for 
progression-free survival was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.47-0.85). Atezo-beva treatment was 
associated with an increase of 1.13 life-years and an increase of 0.69 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), as well as a $78,280 increase in cost per 
patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $113,892 per QALY. The 
incremental net health benefit and the incremental net monetary benefit were 
0.17 QALYs and $24,770, respectively, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
$150,000 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the HR for progression-free 
survival. The probability of atezo-beva being considered cost effective was 78%, 
and it was >50% in most of the subgroups at the WTP threshold of $150,000 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: At a WTP threshold of $150,000 per QALY and under current drug 
pricing, atezo-beva is likely considered cost-effective as a first-line 
treatment for advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma compared with
