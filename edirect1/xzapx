trend, <.001 for all). Men with a normal waist girth and who were physically fit 
and not smoking had a 59% lower risk of CHD events (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 39%-72%), a 77% lower risk of CVD mortality (95% CI, 65%-85%), and a 69% 
lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 60%-76%) compared with men with none 
of these low-risk factors. Men with 0 compared with 3 low-risk factors had a 
shorter life expectancy by 14.2 years (95% CI, 12.2-15.9 years).
CONCLUSION: Being physically fit, not smoking, and maintaining a normal waist 
girth is associated with lower risk of CHD events, and CVD and all-cause 
mortality in men.

    Ann Intern Med. 2009 Dec 15;151(12):I31.

BACKGROUND: Decisions on the timing and extent of vaccination against pandemic 
(H1N1) 2009 virus are complex.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pandemic 
influenza (H1N1) vaccination under different scenarios in October or November 
2009.
DESIGN: Compartmental epidemic model in conjunction with a Markov model of 
disease progression.
DATA SOURCES: Literature and expert opinion.
TARGET POPULATION: Residents of a major U.S. metropolitan city with a population 
of 8.3 million.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination in mid-October or mid-November 2009.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections and deaths averted, costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Assuming each primary infection causes 1.5 
secondary infections, vaccinating 40% of the population in October or November 
would be cost-saving. Vaccination in October would avert 2051 deaths, gain 69 
679 QALYs, and save $469 million compared with no vaccination; vaccination in 
November would avert 1468 deaths, gain 49 422 QALYs, and save $302 million.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Vaccination is even more cost-saving if longer 
incubation periods, lower rates of infectiousness, or increased implementation 
of nonpharmaceutical interventions delay time to the peak of the pandemic. 
Vaccination saves fewer lives and is less cost-effective if the epidemic peaks 
earlier than mid-October.
LIMITATIONS: The model assumed homogenous mixing of case-patients and contacts; 
heterogeneous mixing would result in faster initial spread, followed by slower 
spread. Additional costs and savings not included in the model would make 
vaccination more cost-saving.
CONCLUSION: Earlier vaccination against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prevents more 
deaths and is more cost-saving. Complete population coverage is not necessary to 
reduce the viral reproductive rate sufficiently to help shorten the pandemic.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2009 Dec 15;151(12):I31.

BACKGROUND: The pandemic potential of influenza A (H5N1) virus is a prominent 
public health concern of the 21st century.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative 
pandemic (H5N1) mitigation and response strategies.
DESIGN: Compartmental epidemic model in conjunction with a Markov model of 
disease progression.
DATA SOURCES: Literature and expert opinion.
TARGET POPULATION: Residents of a U.S. metropolitan city with a population of 
8.3 million.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTIONS: 3 scenarios: 1) vaccination and antiviral pharmacotherapy in 
quantities similar to those currently available in the U.S. stockpile 
(stockpiled strategy), 2) stockpiled strategy but with expanded distribution of 
antiviral agents (expanded prophylaxis strategy), and 3) stockpiled strategy but 
with adjuvanted vaccine (expanded vaccination strategy). All scenarios assumed 
standard nonpharmaceutical interventions.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections and deaths averted, costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Expanded vaccination was the most effective and 
cost-effective of the 3 strategies, averting 68% of infections and deaths and 
gaining 404 030 QALYs at $10 844 per QALY gained relative to the stockpiled 
strategy.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Expanded vaccination remained incrementally 
cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions.
LIMITATIONS: The model assumed homogenous mixing of cases and contacts; 
heterogeneous mixing would result in faster initial spread, followed by slower 
spread. We did not model interventions for children or older adults; the model 
is not designed to target interventions to specific groups.
CONCLUSION: Expanded adjuvanted vaccination is an effective and cost-effective 
mitigation strategy for an influenza A (H5N1) pandemic. Expanded antiviral 
prophylaxis can help delay the pandemic while additional strategies are 
implemented.

Milan, Milan, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Dialysis increases patient life expectancy but is associated with 
clinically severe and costly complications. Health and economic benefits could 
derive from postponing dialysis with a supplemented very low-protein diet 
(sVLPD).
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted to compare benefits and costs of 
sVLPD versus dialysis in elderly CKD5 patients. Data from 57 patients aged 
>or=70 years, with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 5-7 mL/min, previously 
participating in a clinical trial demonstrating non-inferior mortality and 
morbidity of starting sVLPD compared to dialysis treatment, were analysed: 30 
patients were randomized to dialysis and 27 to sVLPD. A cost-benefit analysis 
was conducted, in the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). Direct 
medical and non-medical benefits and costs occurring in 3.2 mean years of 
follow-up were quantified: time free from dialysis, cost of dialysis treatment, 
hospitalization, drugs, laboratory/instrumental tests, medical visits and travel 
and energy consumption to receive dialysis. Prices/tariffs valid in 2007 were 
used, with an annual discount rate of 5% applied to benefits and costs occurring 
after the first year. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify how 
estimates could vary in different contexts of applications. Results are reported 
as net benefit, expressed as mean euro/patient (patient-year).
RESULTS: The opportunity to safely postpone initiation of dialysis of 1 
year/patient on average translated into an economic benefit to the NHS, 
corresponding to 21 180 euro/patient in the first, 6500 euro/patient in the 
second and 682 euro/patient in the third year of treatment, with a significant 
net benefit in favour of sVLPD even in a worst-case hypothesis.
CONCLUSION: The initiation of sVLPD in elderly CKD5 subjects is a safe and 
beneficial strategy for these patients and allows them to gain economic 
resources that can be allocated to further health care investments.

In a population of patients who have undergone renal replacement therapy, the 
21st century brought a rise in the number of elderly people as well as patients 
with obesity, with renal complications of systemic diseases, especially diabetes 
and hypertension, and a constantly increasing number of patients with congestive 
heart failure who require intermittent or permanent dialysis support. In keeping 
with the concept of an integrated approach to renal replacement therapy, 
peritoneal dialysis should be the first option in renal replacement treatment, 
especially in patients with residual renal function. This paper summarizes the 
current evidence supporting the view that the changing demography and 
epidemiology of chronic kidney disease imposes an introduction of 
patient-friendly modifications of therapeutic options available in these patient 
groups.

RESPONSE EXPECTANCIES AND IRRATIONAL BELIEFS PREDICT EXAM-RELATED DISTRESS.

Montgomery GH(1), David D, Dilorenzo TA, Schnur JB.

Author information:
(1)Mount Sinai School of Medicine, USA.

Individual differences in cognitive factors such as response expectancies and 
irrational beliefs (IBs) have been shown to contribute to variability in 
distress associated with stressful situations. However, their independent 
influence on distress when examined within the same study has not been 
established, nor has the potential of mediational relationships. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the contribution of response expectancies and IBs 
(both general and exam-specific) to exam-related distress in a prospective 
study. Results revealed that both response expectancies and general IBs 
separately predicted exam-related distress (p's <.05; N = 105). Observed effects 
of general IBs were perfectly mediated by, and observed effects of exam-specific 
IBs were partially mediated by, response expectancies using the Baron and Kenny 
approach. These data support the view that cognitive factors contribute to 
psychological distress and are consistent with response expectancy and rational 
emotive behavior theories. The results suggest that interventions focused on 
response expectancies and IBs might be an effective means to reduce 
psychological distress associated with real life stressors such as exams. Future 
research is needed to determine whether this effect generalizes to other 
stressful situations.

Cardiac amyloidosis is a disease with a gloom life expectancy after the 
beginning of the symptomatic phase, usually with sudden death as the final 
event. The aggression to other organs, although, can make heart transplantation 
a disputable form of treatment taking into consideration the shortage of donor 
organs. The aim is to report the evolution with a survival of seven years after 
heart transplantation and in very fair condition of a patient with amyloidosis. 
One year after the heart transplantation, there was indication of renal 
transplantation also from the aggression from the disease. This patient 
compares' favorable with three other patients also from our service, who died 
early after de diagnosis. Even considering the multi systemic nature of 
amyloidosis, we can accept that in peculiar patients justified the heart 
transplantation, taking in the consideration the very bad prognosis of the 
disease.

Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIA) and desmoplastic infantile 
ganglioglioma (DIG) are rare intracranial tumors that mostly occur in the first 
2 years of life and involve superficial cerebral cortex. Despite the large size 
of these lesions and some worrisome histological and radiological features, 
prognosis is generally favorable after gross total resection. We report an 
original observation of a desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma in a 5-year-old boy 
with multiple localizations on initial presentation, including the unusual 
subtentorial region. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a temporal tumor with 
prepontine and interpeduncular extension, and two other distinct localizations 
in cisterna magna and left cerebellar hemisphere. Leptomeningeal enhancements 
were present around the basal cistern. The surgical samples, corresponding 
exclusively to subtentorial lesions, were devoid of anaplastic features; the 
temporal lesion was untouched because of the interpeduncular extension. Adjuvant 
chemotherapy was applied, with shrinkage of lesions. DIA and DIG are more 
generally unifocal at initial presentation. When the tumor is large, 
multilobular involvement is common, but multiple location of DIG is, on the 
contrary, very rare. Previously, only five cases of DIG/DIA located in two or 
more separate locations have been published. We report the sixth, and first 
noninfantile, case of DIA/DIG with multifocal initial presentation.

The medical insurance system of Japan is based on the Universal Medical Care 
System guaranteed by the provision of the Article 25 of the Constitution of 
Japan, which states that "All the people shall have the right to live a healthy, 
cultural and minimum standard of life." The health insurance system of Japan 
comprises the medical insurance system and the health care system for the 
long-lived. Medical care insurance includes the employees' health insurance 
(Social Insurance) that covers employees of private companies and their families 
and community insurance (National Health Insurance) that covers the 
self-employed. Each medical insurance system has its own medical care system for 
the retired and their families. The health care system for the long-lived covers 
people of over 75 years of age (over 65 years in people with a certain 
handicap). There is also a system under which all or part of the medical 
expenses is reimbursed by public expenditure or the cost of medical care not 
covered by health insurance is paid by the government. This system is referred 
to collectively as the "the public payment system of medical expenses." To 
support the realization of the purpose of this system, there is a treatment 
research enterprise for specified diseases (intractable diseases). Because of 
the high mortality rate, acute pancreatitis is specified as an intractable 
disease for the purpose of reducing its mortality rate, and treatment expenses 
of patients are paid in full by the government dating back to the day when the 
application was made for a certificate verifying that he or she has severe acute 
pancreatitis.

Debates about the ethical and social implications of research that aims to 
extend human longevity by intervening in the ageing process have paid little 
attention to the attitudes of members of the general public. In the absence of 
empirical evidence, conflicting assumptions have been made about likely public 
attitudes towards life-extension. In light of recent calls for greater public 
involvement in such discussions, this target article presents findings from 
focus groups and individual interviews which investigated whether members of the 
general public identify ethical issues surrounding life-extension, and if so, 
what these ethical issues are? In this study, while some participants were 
concerned primarily with the likely personal consequences of life-extension, for 
others the question of whether or not to pursue interventions to extend 
longevity, and how they should be implemented, clearly raised important ethical 
issues, many of which have been prominent in debates among bioethicists.

A fish of many scales: extrapolating sublethal pesticide exposures to the 
productivity of wild salmon populations.

For more than a decade, numerous pesticides have been detected in river systems 
of the western United States that support anadromous species of Pacific salmon 
and steelhead. Over the same interval, several declining wild salmon populations 
have been listed as either threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered 
Species Act (ESA). Because pesticides occur in surface waters that provide 
critical habitat for ESA-listed stocks, they are an ongoing concern for salmon 
conservation and recovery throughout California and the Pacific Northwest. 
Because pesticide exposures are typically sublethal, a key question is whether 
toxicological effects at (or below) the scale of the individual animal 
ultimately reduce the productivity and recovery potential of wild populations. 
In this study we evaluate how the sublethal impacts of pesticides on physiology 
and behavior can reduce the somatic growth of juvenile chinook salmon 
(Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and, by extension, subsequent size-dependent survival 
when animals migrate to the ocean and overwinter in their first year. Our 
analyses focused on the organophosphate and carbamate classes of insecticides. 
These neurotoxic chemicals have been widely detected in aquatic environments. 
They inhibit acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme in the salmon nervous system that 
regulates neurotransmitter-mediated signaling at synapses. Based on empirical 
data, we developed a model that explicitly links sublethal reductions in 
acetylcholinesterase activity to reductions in feeding behavior, food ration, 
growth, and size at migration. Individual size was then used to estimate 
size-dependent survival during migration and transition to the sea. Individual 
survival estimates were then integrated into a life-history population 
projection matrix and used to calculate population productivity and growth rate. 
Our results indicate that short-term (i.e., four-day) exposures that are 
representative of seasonal pesticide use may be sufficient to reduce the growth 
and size at ocean entry of juvenile chinook. The consequent reduction in 
individual survival over successive years reduces the intrinsic productivity 
(lambda) of a modeled ocean-type chinook population. Overall, we show that 
exposures to common pesticides may place important constraints on the recovery 
of ESA-listed salmon species, and that simple models can be used to extrapolate 
toxicological impacts across several scales of biological complexity.

Cost effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy in follicular lymphoma: 
long-term economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Rituximab maintenance therapy was shown to significantly extend 
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in relapsed/refractory 
follicular lymphoma (FL) in the pivotal EORTC 20981 trial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term costs and cost effectiveness of rituximab 
maintenance therapy after induction therapy versus current standard practice 
(observation) from the French National Health Service perspective.
METHODS: A lifetime transition model was developed comparing rituximab 
maintenance with observation. PFS and OS were obtained from the EORTC 20981 
trial with a median follow-up of 28 months and extrapolated from 2-year 
Kaplan-Meier curves using a Weibull distribution. PFS and OS benefits of 
rituximab were conservatively assumed to last only 5 years. Utility data were 
obtained from a multicentre observational study using the EQ-5D questionnaire. 
Direct medical costs were obtained from French official sources. All costs are 
reported in euro, year 2006 values.
RESULTS: The EORTC 20981 study demonstrated that rituximab maintenance was 
effective in the management of relapsed/refractory FL. The model results showed 
that life expectancy and QALYs were increased by 22% and 28%, respectively, in 
patients treated with rituximab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were euro 7612 per life-year gained and euro 8729 per QALY gained. In a 
one-way sensitivity analysis, most of the ICERs fell within the range of euro 
7000-12,000. The results tend to show that rituximab maintenance therapy may be 
a cost-effective strategy in the management of relapsed/refractory FL in France, 
with ICERs below those observed for other therapies in the oncology field. The 
cost of rituximab was partly offset by the lower cost of relapse due to a longer 
time in the disease-free health state for patients in the rituximab arm.

BACKGROUND: A recent study found fewer hospitalizations for congestive heart 
failure (CHF) patients receiving high-dose versus low-dose statin therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost effectiveness of high-dose versus low-dose statin 
therapy in CHF patients.
METHODS: Two scenarios (literature-based [base-case scenario] vs trial-based 
post-event mortality [alternative scenario]) assessed the cost effectiveness of 
atorvastatin 80 mg/day (A80) versus atorvastatin 10 mg/day (A10) in patients 
with both CHF and coronary heart disease (CHD) [CHF/CHD], using a lifetime 
Markov model. The model predicts treatment-specific probabilities of major and 
minor cardiovascular events and death, based on clinical trial data. The quality 
of life and costs were literature based. Measures included costs per life-year 
saved (LYS) and QALY gained. Health consequences and costs were discounted at 
3.0% annually. Analyses were conducted from the payer perspective and valued in 
$US, year 2006-7 values.
RESULTS: Literature-based mortality estimates (base case) increased life-years 
and QALYs for A80 compared with A10 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
[ICERs]: $US9600 per LYS; $US13 600 per QALY). At a willingness to pay of $US100 
000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 80% of simulations. A10 dominated A80 
when using trial-based mortality estimates (alternative scenario). At a 
willingness to pay of $US100 000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 48% of 
simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive A80 treatment may be cost effective versus A10 in 
cardiovascular prevention in CHF/CHD patients in the US, due to projected gains 
in life expectancy and health-related quality of life. However, the results are 
highly sensitive to assumptions about the mortality rate in the model. When 
using the mortality rate observed in the trial, A10 dominates A80.

A policy model to evaluate the benefits, risks and costs of warfarin 
pharmacogenomic testing.

    Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res. 2010 Aug;10(4):375-8.

BACKGROUND: In 2007, the US FDA added information about pharmacogenomics to the 
warfarin label based on the influence of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes on 
anticoagulation-related outcomes. Payers will be facing increasing demand for 
coverage decisions regarding this technology, but the potential clinical and 
economic impacts of testing are not clear.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a policy model to evaluate the potential outcomes of 
warfarin pharmacogenomic testing based on the most recently available data.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to assess the addition 
of genetic testing to anticoagulation clinic standard care for a hypothetical 
cohort of warfarin patients. The model was based on anticoagulation status 
(international normalized ratio), a common outcome measure in clinical trials 
that captures both the benefits and risks of warfarin therapy. Initial estimates 
of testing effects were derived from a recently completed randomized controlled 
trial (n = 200). Healthcare cost ($US, year 2007 values) and health-state 
utility data were obtained from the literature. The perspective was that of a US 
third-party payer. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed 
to explore the range of plausible results.
RESULTS: The policy model included thromboembolic events (TEs) and bleeding 
events and was populated by data from the COUMAGEN trial. The rate of bleeding 
calculated for standard care approximated bleeding rates found in an independent 
cohort of warfarin patients. According to our model, pharmacogenomic testing 
provided an absolute reduction in the incidence of bleeds of 0.17%, but an 
absolute increase in the incidence of TEs of 0.03%. The improvement in QALYs was 
small, 0.003, with an increase in total cost of $US162 (year 2007 values). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranged from testing dominating to 
standard care dominating, and the ICER was <$US50,000 per QALY in 46% of 
simulations. Results were most sensitive to the cost of genotyping and the 
effect of genotyping.
CONCLUSION: Our model, based on initial clinical studies to date, suggests that 
warfarin pharmacogenomic testing may provide a small clinical benefit with 
significant uncertainty in economic value. Given the uncertainty in the 
analysis, further updates will be important as additional clinical data become 
available.

Euglena gracilis ascorbate peroxidase forms an intramolecular dimeric structure: 
its unique molecular characterization.

Euglena gracilis lacks a catalase and contains a single APX (ascorbate 
peroxidase) and enzymes related to the redox cycle of ascorbate in the cytosol. 
In the present study, a full-length cDNA clone encoding the Euglena APX was 
isolated and found to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein of 649 
amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 70.5 kDa. Interestingly, the 
enzyme consisted of two entirely homologous catalytic domains, designated APX-N 
and APX-C, and an 102 amino acid extension in the N-terminal region, which had a 
typical class II signal proposed for plastid targeting in Euglena. A 
computer-assisted analysis indicated a novel protein structure with an 
intramolecular dimeric structure. The analysis of cell fractionation showed that 
the APX protein is distributed in the cytosol, but not the plastids, suggesting 
that Euglena APX becomes mature in the cytosol after processing of the 
precursor. The kinetics of the recombinant mature FL (full-length)-APX and the 
APX-N and APX-C domains with ascorbate and H2O2 were almost the same as that of 
the native enzyme. However, the substrate specificity of the mature FL-APX and 
the native enzyme was different from that of APX-N and APX-C. The mature FL-APX, 
but not the truncated forms, could reduce alkyl hydroperoxides, suggesting that 
the dimeric structure is correlated with substrate recognition. In Euglena cells 
transfected with double-stranded RNA, the silencing of APX expression resulted 
in a significant increase in the cellular level of H2O2, indicating the 
physiological importance of APX to the metabolism of H2O2.

AIM: The aim of our study was to investigate survival and causes of death in a 
complete cohort of open spina bifida at the mean age of 40 years.
METHOD: We conducted a community-based, prospective study of 117 consecutive 
infants (50 males, 67 females) with open spina bifida whose backs were closed 
non-selectively within 48 hours of birth between 1963 and 1971 at Addenbrooke's 
Hospital, Cambridge, UK. Of those who survived to age 1 year, 89% (82 out of 92) 
had a cerebrospinal fluid shunt. In 2007, all survivors were surveyed by postal 
questionnaire backed up by telephone interview. Details of deaths were obtained 
from the Office for National Statistics, medical records, and autopsy reports, 
and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed.
RESULTS: One in three of the cohort (40/117) died before the age of 5 years. A 
further 26% (31/117) died during the next 35 years, over 10 times the national 
average. Half the deaths (16/31) after the age of 5 were sudden and unexpected. 
All occurred in the community and were followed by a coroner's autopsy. The most 
frequent causes of these unexpected deaths were epilepsy, pulmonary embolus, 
acute hydrocephalus, and acute renal sepsis. The prognosis for survival was 
strikingly poor in those with the most extensive neurological deficit. Only 17% 
(7/42) of those born with a high sensory level (above T11) survived to the mean 
age of 40 years, compared with 61% (23/38) of those with a low sensory level 
(below L3; p=0.001).
INTERPRETATION: Doctors and care planners need to be aware that, contrary to 
previous suggestions, there is continuing high mortality throughout adult life 
in individuals with open spina bifida, and many deaths are unexpected.

[Life expectancy increasing, but gap between people of higher and lower 
educational level remains].

[Article in Dutch]

OBJECTIVE: To determine if since 1997 there has been a change in the gap in life 
expectancy between those of higher and lower educational level.
DESIGN: Statistical analysis of register and survey data.
METHOD: Linkage of data from municipal population registers and the Labour Force 
Survey of Statistics Netherlands.
RESULTS: Life expectancy of both men and women was positively correlated with 
level of education. The life expectancy of Dutch men increased by about two 
years in the period 1997-2005, irrespective of level of education. Women gained 
about one year, but life expectancy among those of both lower and higher levels 
of education stagnated. During the study period the gap in life expectancy 
between these educational extremes remained almost constant at about 5 to 6 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to both favourable and unfavourable trends. All 
population groups seemed to have profited from a recent relatively strong 
increase in life expectancy which is clearly a positive development. Less 
favourable was the fact that the gap between those of lower and higher 
educational level had not decreased.

[Aortic disease in women].

Abdominal aortic disease in women is associated with atheromatous processes much 
more often than with inflammatory arterial diseases (such as Takayasu or 
Horton). Intramural hematomas and atheromatous ulcers of the aorta, albeit rare, 
affect as many women as men and have variable outcomes: some are resolved with 
heparin treatment, and others are fatal. Atherosclerotic stenoses and occlusions 
limited to the level of the aortoiliac bifurcation are increasingly prevalent 
and difficult to treat in young women, in part because of their addiction to 
smoking. After being more or less ignored for a long time, the particularity of 
atheromatous abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in women is now being recognized. 
AAA in women are less frequent than in men, but grow faster and have a higher 
risk of rupture; moreover, cardiovascular disease is generally detected and 
managed less often in women. Overall mortality from AAA in women is similar to 
that of breast cancer. The two major risk factors for AAA are, as in men, a 
direct family history of AAA and smoking. The diagnostic standards for AAA, the 
criteria for defining progression, and the indications for surgery are probably 
not the same as in men, and the smaller initial caliber of women's aortas must 
be taken into account. Most guidelines today recommend ultrasound screening for 
AAA for women older than 50 years with a family history (in a 1(st)degree 
relative), women aged 60-75 years who are hypertensive or smoke, and smokers 
older than 75 years without serious comorbidity and with a life expectancy 
essentially normal for their age. Monitoring patients with a small AAA 
(anteroposterior diameter < 40-45 mm) must not be limited only to the aneurysm, 
but must also include comprehensive management to eliminate modifiable risk 
factors and thus to reduce cardiovascular and surgical risk (by better preparing 
the patient for this possibility) as well as to slow the progression of the 
aneurysm and decrease the risk of its rupture.

Research on ageing, health and gender: A long and winding road. Reply to 
Månsdotter's 'Further thoughts on gender and lifetime health'.

This contribution is a reply to Dr. Månsdotter's comments on our discussion 
paper 'Health and well-being in old age: the pertinence of a gender 
mainstreaming approach in research' published in Gerontology [Gerontology 2010 
(in press)]. Even though the comments are interesting and comprehensible, they 
cannot be left unanswered, this primarily because they are based on weak 
empirical evidence. (1) It is broadly uncontested that gender is not static. 
However, the conclusion that the more egalitarian division of parental duties 
can be viewed as an indicator for reduction of the gender gap in longevity and 
health is highly speculative. There is not enough empirical evidence to 
substantiate this position. (2) The 'caring hypothesis' proposed by Månsdotter, 
which holds that caring fathers develop less risky lifestyles and increased 
worries, is a possible, but not a sufficient explanation for gender convergence 
of physical and psychological health in future generations. Such a convergence 
seems to be heavily co-determined by the changing lifestyles of women. (3) From 
a lifespan developmental perspective, androgyny does not mean gender equality, 
but a necessary openness of an individual for the positive traits of the 
opposing gender role, an essential trait for successful ageing. (4) Månsdotter's 
doubts concerning the implementation of gender mainstreaming in gerontological 
research and practice because of society's limited resources are not 
comprehensible. Exactly because economical resources are limited, and exactly 
because men and women have different resources and disadvantages due to their 
specific bio-psycho-social realities, the most efficient way of dealing with the 
gender gaps in health is with a differentialapproach. (5) The concluding 
recommendation of Månsdotter for more openness as a scientific position 
regarding the impact of gender roles on human health and well-being stands in 
contrast to her claim for normative standpoints and prioritization of either 
women or men in health promotion. We certainly need openness as a scientific 
position, but what we urgently need are good theoretical frameworks and more 
interdisciplinary and longitudinal approaches, which help to overcome the thin 
empirical base we have. This is a challenge and a chance for future research.

The highest mortality in developed countries is, according to the data from our 
as well as international literature, among people from low socioeconomic 
backgrounds. No recent data are available for the Czech Republic. We compared 
the estimated median life expectancy in 2001-2005 with the proportion of people 
with basic education only and with the proportion of unemployed in all regions 
within the Czech Republic. We confirmed significant negative correlation--people 
in regions with low socioeconomic status had lower estimated median life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Despite the decline in the total and cardiovascular mortality in 
particular in the Czech Republic over the last 20 years, the highest mortality 
and shortest medium life expectancy continue to persist in the regions with the 
lowest socioeconomic status as measured by the educational status and 
unemployment.

Remaining life expectancy among older people in a rural area of Vietnam: trends 
and socioeconomic inequalities during a period of multiple transitions.

BACKGROUND: Better understanding of the trends and disparities in health at old 
age in terms of life expectancy will help to provide appropriate responses to 
the growing needs of health and social care for the older population in the 
context of limited resources. As a result of rapid economic, demographic and 
epidemiological changes, the number of people aged 60 and over in Vietnam is 
increasing rapidly, from 6.7% in 1979 to 9.2% in 2006. Life expectancy at birth 
has increased but not much are known about changes in old ages. This study 
assesses the trends and socioeconomic inequalities in RLE at age 60 in a rural 
area in an effort to highlight this vulnerable group and to anticipate their 
future health and social needs.
METHODS: An abridged life table adjusted for small area data was used to 
estimate cohort life expectancies at old age and the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals from longitudinal data collected by FilaBavi DSS during 
1999-2006, which covered 7,668 people at age 60+ with 43,272 person-years, out 
of a total of 64,053 people with 388,278 person-years. Differences in life 
expectancy were examined according to socioeconomic factors, including 
socio-demographic characteristics, wealth, poverty and living arrangements.
RESULTS: Life expectancies at age 60 have increased by approximately one year 
from the period 1999-2002 to 2003-2006. The increases are observed in both 
sexes, but are significant among females and relate to improvements among those 
who belong to the middle and upper household wealth quintiles. However, life 
expectancy tends to decrease in the most vulnerable groups. There is a wide gap 
in life expectancy according to poverty status and living arrangements, and the 
gap by poverty status has widened over the study period. The gender gap in life 
expectancy is consistent across all socioeconomic groups and tends to be wider 
amongst the more disadvantaged population.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a trend of increasing life expectancy among older people 
in rural areas of Vietnam. Inequalities in life expectancy exist between 
socioeconomic groups, especially between different poverty levels and also 
patterns of living arrangements. These inequalities should be addressed by 
appropriate social and health policies with stronger targeting of the poorest 
and most disadvantaged groups.

A cost-utility analysis of antenatal screening to prevent congenital rubella 
syndrome.

Unit, Bilthoven, The Netherlands. anna.lugner@rivm.nl

In low vaccination coverage regions (LVR) in The Netherlands people often reject 
participation in the National Immunization Programme for religious reasons. 
During a rubella epidemic in 2004-2005, 32 pregnant women were notified with 
rubella, and 11 babies were born with defects related to maternal infection. 
This study presents a cost-utility analysis of a screening and vaccination 
programme for rubella focusing on three scenarios: (1) screening non-vaccinated 
pregnant women in LVR; (2) screening all pregnant women in LVR; (3) screening 
all non-vaccinated pregnant women in The Netherlands (including pregnant 
first-generation non-Western immigrant women). Cost-utility was estimated over a 
16-year period which included two rubella outbreaks. Observed complications from 
the 2004-2005 epidemic were used to estimate average cost savings and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. The programme would be cost-effective 
(euro1100/QALY gained) when assuming an acceptability of vaccination of 20% in 
women belonging to orthodox protestant risk groups.
