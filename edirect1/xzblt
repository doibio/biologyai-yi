exercise, acupuncture, massage, yoga, cognitive behavioural therapy or 
relaxation. The purpose of this review was to evaluate published economic 
evaluations of pharmacological management for chronic lower back pain. A total 
of seven studies were eligible for inclusion in there view. The quality of the 
economic evaluations undertaken in the included studies was not high. This was 
primarily because of the nature of the underlying clinical evidence, most of 
which did not come from rigorous randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and the 
manner in which it was incorporated into the economic evaluations. All studies 
provided reasonable information about what aspects of healthcare and other 
resource use were identified, measured and valued. However, the reporting of 
total costs was not uniform across studies. Measures of pain and disability were 
the most commonly collected outcomes measures. Two studies collected information 
on quality of life directly from participants while two studies modelled this 
information based on the literature. Future economic evaluations of 
interventions for chronic lower back pain, including pharmacological 
interventions, should be based on the results of well-conducted RCTs where the 
measurement of costs and outcomes such as quality of life and quality-adjusted 
life-years is included in the trial protocol, and which have a follow-up period 
sufficient to capture meaningful changes in both costs and outcomes. In the 
absence of RCT data, economic models should be used to estimate future costs and 
outcomes using robust methods.

OBJECTIVES: This analysis examined the life expectancies (LE) and expected years 
of life lost (EYLL) in relation to oral cancer in Taiwan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-parametric extrapolation method was applied to 
estimate gender, age, histology, subsite, and stage stratified LE, EYLL of 
22,024 pathologically verified oral cancer patients retrospectively recruited 
from the National Cancer Registry of Taiwan during 2002-2009, who were followed 
up to 2011.
RESULTS: The patients were predominantly male 20,101, (91.3%), and over 80% were 
less than 65years old. The mean age at diagnosis of males was younger than that 
of females (52.73years vs. 60.76years). The LE after diagnosis was longer among 
females than males (15.26years vs. 12.73years), with a smaller loss of the 
corresponding EYLL (8.88years vs. 14.05years), which prevails after 
stratification by age and stage. More than half of the oral cancer cases were 
diagnosed at a later stage, with 2921 cases (13.3%) of stage III and 8488 
(38.5%) of stage IV. The five-year overall survival rate of oral cancer for 
stages I, II, III, and IV were 78.98%, 69.38%, 54.62%, and 36.17%, respectively. 
The earlier the diagnosis, the longer the life expectancy and the smaller the 
EYLL.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that early detection and early intervention of oral 
cancer can prolong life expectancy and reduce the years of life lost, indicating 
the importance of proactive screening and oral hygiene.

Making the White Matter Matters: Progress in Understanding Canavan's Disease and 
Therapeutic Interventions Through Eight Decades.

Canavan's disease (CD) is a fatal autosomal recessive pediatric leukodystrophy 
in which patients show severe neurodegeneration and typically die by the age of 
10, though life expectancy in patients can be highly variable. Currently, there 
is no effective treatment for CD; however, gene therapy seems to be a feasible 
approach to combat the disease. Being a monogenic defect, the disease provides 
an excellent model system to develop gene therapy approaches that can be 
extended to other monogenic leukodystrophies and neurodegenerative diseases. CD 
results from mutations in a single gene aspartoacylase which hydrolyses N-acetyl 
aspartic acid (NAA) which accumulates in its absences. Since CD is one of the 
few diseases that show high NAA levels, it can also be used to study the 
enigmatic biological role of NAA. The disease was first described in 1931, and 
this review traces the progress made in the past 8 decades to understand the 
disease by enumerating current hypotheses and ongoing palliative measures to 
alleviate patient symptoms in the context of the latest advances in the field.

Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: To compare limitations in health between Dutch patients with gout and 
the general population and to determine factors influencing societal and patient 
values for health as assessed with different utility approaches.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done among 110 patients with gout under the 
care of a rheumatologist, with patients completing the EuroQol 5-domain 
instrument (EQ-5D), the EQ-5D visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS), and the Short 
Form 6-dimensions health survey (SF-6D). Scores on EQ-5D domains were compared 
with age- and sex-matched general population data. Agreement between utility 
measures was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). 
Mixture modeling was used to assess factors associated with the different 
approaches to assess utility.
RESULTS: Compared to the general population, gout patients reported more 
limitations in mobility (66% versus 12%), self-care (24% versus 8%), daily 
activities (49% versus 24%), and pain (76% versus 45%), but equal 
anxiety/depressive symptoms (18% versus 19%). For patients with gout, utilities 
were reduced: the mean, median, and interquartile range, respectively, were 
0.74, 0.81, and 0.69-0.84 for EQ-5D, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.59-0.81 for SF-6D, and 
66, 70, and 57-77 for EQ-5D VAS. ICC agreement between each pair of utilities 
was only moderate (0.52-0.59). Only minor differences were seen in the type of 
variables associated with each utility approach, with worse Health Assessment 
Questionnaire scores, cardiovascular disease (CVD), gout concern, and gout pain 
consistently associated with lower utility. The strength of contribution of 
these variables, however, differed among the 3 approaches.
CONCLUSION: Patients with gout experience substantially impaired health compared 
to the general population. Although absolute values of utility varied between 
instruments and perspectives, functional disability, CVD, and higher gout impact 
contributed to utility independently of which instrument was used.

BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening procedures 
can inflate healthcare costs and increase medical risk. Little is known about 
the prevalence or causes of inappropriate CRC screening.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate 
CRC screening, and its association with patient and facility characteristics in 
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) .
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of all VHA 
patients aged 50 years and older who completed a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) 
or a screening colonoscopy between 1 October 2009 and 31 December 2011 (n = 
1,083,965).
MAIN MEASURES: Measures included: proportion of patients whose test was 
classified as potentially inappropriate; associations between potentially 
inappropriate screening and patient demographic and health characteristics, 
facility complexity, CRC screening rates, dependence on FOBT, and CRC clinical 
reminder attributes.
KEY RESULTS: Of 901,292 FOBT cases, 26.1 % were potentially inappropriate (13.9 
% not due, 7.8 % limited life expectancy, 11.0 % receiving FOBT when colonoscopy 
was indicated). Of 134,335 screening colonoscopies, 14.2 % were potentially 
inappropriate (10.4 % not due, 4.4 % limited life expectancy). Each additional 
10 years of patient age was associated with an increased likelihood of 
undergoing potentially inappropriate screening (ORs = 1.60 to 1.83 depending on 
screening mode). Compared to facilities scoring in the bottom third on a measure 
of reliance on FOBT (versus screening colonoscopy), facilities scoring in the 
top third were less likely to conduct potentially inappropriate FOBTs (OR = 
0.,78) but more likely to conduct potentially inappropriate colonoscopies (OR = 
2.20). Potentially inappropriate colonoscopies were less likely to be conducted 
at facilities where primary care providers were assigned partial responsibility 
(OR = 0.74) or full responsibility (OR = 0.73) for completing the CRC clinical 
reminder.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of VHA CRC screening tests are potentially 
inappropriate. Establishing processes that enforce appropriate screening 
intervals, triage patients with limited life expectancies, and discourage the 
use of FOBTs when a colonoscopy is indicated may reduce inappropriate testing.

Stroke is the third leading cause of death, a major cause of disability in 
adults, and is frequently more disabling than fatal. With a decline in mortality 
from initial cerebral infarction and an increase in the life expectancy of the 
population, the number of patients with recurrent stroke and ensuing 
cardiovascular events will become greater. Thus it is important to find out 
those patients at high risk of stroke recurrence. This case report illustrates 
the process of recurrent stroke and the resulting disabilities and morbidities 
in a 42-year- old man. The role of integrated stroke rehabilitation programme is 
described.

INTRODUCTION: Gout is an increasingly common medical problem. The traditional 
risk factors of male sex and high red meat or alcohol consumption have been 
joined with newer risks such as increased life expectancy, and the metabolic 
syndrome (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, truncal obesity).
METHODS: This was a retrospective study to determine the epidemiology, clinical 
features, associated conditions as well as renal related conditions in existing 
gout patients followed-up in Rheumatology outpatient clinic, Hospital Tuanku 
Ja'afar, Seremban.
RESULTS: Over a three month period, we identified 54 gouty patients on our 
follow-up, the majority being male, Malay ethnicity, with the age of onset in 
the third and fourth decades of life. Commonly associated risk factors were 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity. However, underlying history of 
diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, and family history were not commonly 
associated with gout in our group of patients. Half of our patients had at least 
two or more joints involvement. About half of the patients with tophaceous gout 
had renal impairment.
CONCLUSION: Our series of gout patients highlight the high prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors. The high prevalence of tophi and renal impairment 
is a cause for concern.

University Hospital, Norway.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial with 2-year follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of X-stop to minimally invasive 
decompression in patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common indication 
for operative treatment in elderly. Although surgery is more costly than 
nonoperative treatment, health outcomes for more than 2 years were shown to be 
significantly better. Surgical treatment with minimally invasive decompression 
is widely used. X-stop is introduced as another minimally invasive technique 
showing good results compared with nonoperative treatment.
METHODS: We enrolled 96 patients aged 50 to 85 years, with symptoms of 
neurogenic intermittent claudication within 250-m walking distance and 1- or 
2-level lumbar spinal stenosis, randomized to either minimally invasive 
decompression or X-stop. Quality-adjusted life-years were based on EuroQol 
EQ-5D. The hospital unit costs were estimated by means of the top-down approach. 
Each cost unit was converted into a monetary value by dividing the overall cost 
by the amount of cost units produced. The analysis of costs and health outcomes 
is presented by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: The study was terminated after a midway interim analysis because of 
significantly higher reoperation rate in the X-stop group (33%). The incremental 
cost for X-stop compared with minimally invasive decompression was &OV0556;2832 
(95% confidence interval: 1886-3778), whereas the incremental health gain was 
0.11 quality-adjusted life-year (95% confidence interval: -0.01 to 0.23). Based 
on the incremental cost and effect, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
&OV0556;25,700.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the bootstrap samples displayed in the northeast 
corner of the cost-effectiveness plane, giving a 50% likelihood that X-stop is 
cost-effective at the extra cost of &OV0556;25,700 (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio) for a quality-adjusted life-year. The significantly 
higher cost of X-stop is mainly due to implant cost and the significantly higher 
reoperation rate.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by Staphylococcus aureus have 
increasingly given rise to human health and food safety. Genetically engineered 
small molecular antibody is a useful tool in immuno-detection and treatment for 
clinical illness caused by SEs. In this study, we constructed the V(L)-V(H) 
tail-parallel genetically engineered antibody against SEs by using the 
repertoire of rearranged germ-line immunoglobulin variable region genes. Total 
RNA were extracted from six hybridoma cell lines that stably express anti-SEs 
antibodies. The variable region genes of light chain (V(L)) and heavy chain 
(V(H)) were cloned by reverse transcription PCR, and their classical murine 
antibody structure and functional V(D)J gene rearrangement were analyzed. To 
construct the eukaryotic V(H)-V(L) tail-parallel co-expression vectors based on 
the "5'-V(H)-ivs-IRES-V(L)-3'" mode, the ivs-IRES fragment and V(L) genes were 
spliced by two-step overlap extension PCR, and then, the recombined gene 
fragment and V(H) genes were inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector 
sequentially. And then the constructed eukaryotic expression clones termed as 
p2C2HILO and p5C12HILO were transfected into baby hamster kidney 21 cell line, 
respectively. Two clonal cell lines stably expressing V(L)-V(H) tail-parallel 
antibodies against SEs were obtained, and the antibodies that expressed 
intracytoplasma were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
immunofluorescence assay, and flow cytometry. SEs can stimulate the expression 
of some chemokines and chemokine receptors in porcine IPEC-J2 cells; mRNA 
transcription level of four chemokines and chemokine receptors can be blocked by 
the recombinant SE antibody prepared in this study. Our results showed that it 
is possible to get functional V(L)-V(H) tail-parallel genetically engineered 
antibodies in same vector using eukaryotic expression system.

Eggs are sources of protein, fats and micronutrients that play an important role 
in basic nutrition. However, eggs are traditionally associated with adverse 
factors in human health, mainly due to their cholesterol content. Nowadays, 
however, it is known that the response of cholesterol in human serum levels to 
dietary cholesterol consumption depends on several factors, such as ethnicity, 
genetic makeup, hormonal factors and the nutritional status of the consumer. 
Additionally, in recent decades, there has been an increasing demand for 
functional foods, which is expected to continue to increase in the future, owing 
to their capacity to decrease the risks of some diseases and socio-demographic 
factors such as the increase in life expectancy. This work offers a brief 
overview of the advantages and disadvantages of egg consumption and the 
potential market of functional eggs, and it explores the possibilities of the 
development of functional eggs by technological methods.

Antalya, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Renal transplantation is an outstanding therapy for end-stage renal 
failure and has been shown to increase life expectancy and quality of life, 
while reducing medical expenditure. The presence of IgM antibodies in recipient 
serum is not a contraindication for renal transplantation. However, the presence 
of this antibody may have significant clinical implications. IgM autoantibodies 
have been blamed for a group of accelerated or hyperacute cases of graft 
rejection. In this study, graft and patient survival outcomes after renal 
transplantation in LCM IgM-positive recipients have been assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 32 LCM IgM-positive kidney recipients who 
underwent renal transplantation at the Akdeniz University Transplantation Center 
between January 2006 and August 2008 were assessed.
RESULTS: The mean age was 34 ± 13.5 (9-66). Twenty patients were male, and 
twelve were female. The mean length of therapy with dialysis was 22.94 ± 30.06 
months (0-120). The duration of cold ischemia was 28.63 ± 5.85 minutes (21-42).
CONCLUSION: Throughout the follow up period, the mean creatinine level was 1.3 
mg/dL (0.69-4.5). Graft loss occurred in only one patient and was due to 
hemophagocytic syndrome and acute rejection. During follow up, creatinine 
elevation was seen in 12 patients (4%) in the early postoperative period. These 
patients were thought to have transplant rejection, and therapy for rejection 
was given. The therapy was successful. Graft survival was calculated to be 96 ± 
3.5%, and none of the patients were lost.

Publisher: AMAÇ: Böbrek transplantasyonu, beklenen yaşam süresi, ekonomik ve 
yaşam kalitesi bakımından, son dönem böbrek hastalığının seçkin bir tedavisidir. 
IgM antikorlarının alıcı serumunda bulunması, renal transplantasyon için 
kontrendike değildir. Ancak bu antikorlar tamamen masum değildir. Bazı hızlanmış 
veya hiperakut rejeksiyon olgularında, IgM otoantikorları sorumlu tutulmuştur. 
Bu çalışmada; LCM IgM pozitif olan alıcılarda yapılan canlı vericili böbrek 
naklindeki greft ve hasta sağ kalımı sonuçlarımız incelenmiştir.
GEREÇ VE YÖNTEM: Ocak 2006–ağustos 2008 tarihleri arasında Akdeniz Üniversitesi 
Organ Nakli Merkezinde, LCM IgM pozitif canlı donörden böbrek nakli uygulanan 32 
hastanın verileri geriye dönük olarak değerlendirildi.
BULGULAR: Hastaların ortalama yaşı 34±13.5 (9–66)’ti. Olguların 20’si erkek, 
12’si kadın olup, ortalama diyaliz ile tedavi süreleri 22.94±30.06 (0–120) aydı. 
Nakil olan hastalarda soğuk iskemi süresi ise 28.63±5.85 (21–42) dakikaydı.
SONUÇ: Takip süresince ortalama kreatin düzeyi 1.3 mg/dl idi (0.69–4.5). Sadece

In the practice of traditional Chinese medicine, many Yang-tonic herbs have been 
used for retarding the decline in bodily function and delaying the onset of 
age-related diseases. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that 
Yang-invigorating herbs/formulations protect against oxidative injury in various 
organs and also extend the median lifespan in mice. This lifespan extension was 
associated with an upregulation of cellular antioxidant status including that of 
mitochondria whose functional capacity is also increased by "Yang-invigorating" 
herbs/formulations. In this paper, we propose that triterpenes and phytosterols, 
which are ubiquitously found in Yang-tonic herbs, may be the chemical entities 
responsible for enhancing mitochondrial functional and antioxidant capacity and 
thus the "Yang-invigorating" action. The biochemical mechanism underlying this 
"Yang-invigorating" action may involve a sustained production of low levels of 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) secondary to an increased activity 
of the electron transport chain, with the possible involvement of mitochondrial 
uncoupling. The increase in mitochondrial functional capacity can retard the 
decline in bodily function during aging, whereas the mitochondrial ROS 
production is instrumental in eliciting a glutathione antioxidant response via 
redox-sensitive signaling pathways, which can delay the onset of age-related 
diseases.

Pulmonary hypertension has a marked detrimental effect on quality of life and 
life expectancy. In a mouse model of antigen-induced pulmonary arterial 
remodeling, we have recently shown that coexposure to urban ambient particulate 
matter (PM) significantly increased the thickening of the pulmonary arteries and 
also resulted in significantly increased right ventricular systolic pressures. 
Here we interrogate the mechanism and show that combined neutralization of 
interleukin 13 (IL-13) and IL-17A significantly ameliorated the increase in 
right ventricular systolic pressure, the circumferential muscularization of 
pulmonary arteries, and the molecular change in the right ventricle. 
Surprisingly, our data revealed a protective role of IL-17A for the antigen- and 
PM-induced severe thickening of pulmonary arteries. This protection was due to 
the inhibition of the effects of IL-13, which drove this response, and the 
expression of metalloelastase and resistin-like molecule α. However, the latter 
was redundant for the arterial thickening response. Anti-IL-13 exacerbated 
airway neutrophilia, which was due to a resulting excess effect of IL-17A, 
confirming concurrent cross inhibition of IL-13- and IL-17A-dependent responses 
in the lungs of animals exposed to antigen and PM. Our experiments also 
identified IL-13/IL-17A-independent molecular reprogramming in the lungs induced 
by exposure to antigen and PM, which indicates a risk for arterial remodeling 
and protection from arterial constriction. Our study points to IL-13- and 
IL-17A-coinduced inflammation as a new template for biomarkers and therapeutic 
targeting for the management of immune response-induced pulmonary hypertension.

Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2015 update on diagnosis, 
risk-stratification and management.

DISEASE OVERVIEW: Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are 
myeloproliferative neoplasms, respectively characterized by erythrocytosis and 
thrombocytosis. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, 
thrombosis, bleeding, microcirculatory symptoms, pruritus, and risk of leukemic 
or fibrotic transformation.
DIAGNOSIS: PV is defined by a JAK2 mutation, whose absence, combined with normal 
or increased serum erythropoietin level, makes the diagnosis unlikely. 
Differential diagnosis in ET includes reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid 
leukemia, and prefibrotic myelofibrosis. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin 
(CALR), or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations occur in 
approximately 55%, 25%, and 3% of ET patients, respectively. The same molecular 
markers are also present in prefibrotic myelofibrosis, which needs to be 
morphologically distinguished from ET. Survival and leukemic/fibrotic 
transformation: Median survivals are ∼14 years for PV and 20 years for ET; the 
corresponding values for younger patients are 24 and 33 years. Life-expectancy 
in ET is inferior to the control population. JAK2/CALR mutational status does 
not affect survival in ET. Risk factors for survival in ET and PV include 
advanced age, leukocytosis, and thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rates at 20 
years are estimated at <10% for PV and 5% for ET; fibrotic transformation rates 
are slightly higher. Thrombosis risk stratification: Current risk stratification 
in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of recurrent thrombosis: 
high-risk is defined by the presence of age >60 years or presence of thrombosis 
history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. 
Recent data consider JAK2V617F and cardiovascular risk factors as additional 
risk factors. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis might be associated with 
acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding.
RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The main goal of therapy in PV and ET is to prevent 
thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is accomplished by 
the use of low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy (hematocrit target <45%) in PV. In 
high risk (for thrombosis) patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally 
recommended. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-α is usually effective in 
hydroxyurea failures and the additional value of JAK inhibitor therapy in such 
cases is limited. Screening for AvWS is recommended before administrating 
aspirin, in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), a rare type of mesenchymal neoplasm, is 
defined by the WHO as a superficial sarcoma with low-grade malignancy that 
develops in the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. The purpose of this paper is 
to present a case of a giant DFSP, with post-traumatic onset in childhood and a 
very long evolution.
CLINICAL DATA: 51-year-old Caucasian patient presents for 41 years a presternal 
neoplastic lesion, with onset at 10-year-old, few months after a strong trauma. 
The patient addressed for a clinic examination, secondary to a spontaneous 
hemorrhage of the lesion. The local examination reveals the presence of a 
red-purple polynodular neoplastic lesion of 180×110×30 mm, of firm consistency, 
adherent to the subcutaneous tissue, painless, with lateral extension at 8 
o'clock as an erythematous infiltrated atrophic plaque appearance. One of these 
nodular masses presents surface ulceration and areas of necrosis. The CT scan 
did not detect any infiltration into the pectoral muscle or loco-regional 
metastasis. Under general anesthesia a wide surgical excision with free 
macroscopic margins of 3 cm was performed. Histopathological diagnosis was DFSP, 
with evidence of tumoral spindle cells disposed in storiform pattern, embedding 
small adipocyte panicles, creating a lace-like or honeycomb appearance. 
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells express an intense and diffuse CD34 and 
they are negative for S-100 and SMA. The Ki-67 is focal positive in almost 2-4%. 
Clinical and paraclinical monitoring at 18 months follow-up does not detect any 
local recurrences or metastases, and an excellent quality of life.

Immigrant workers are a vulnerable and underserved population. The average 
life expectancy of the migrant worker is 49 years, compared to 77.2 years for 
most Americans. Immigrant workers have a higher disease burden than other 
populations and work in occupations with high hazard levels. In addition, they 
have low socioeconomic levels and face many barriers to accessing healthcare 
services. Undocumented immigrant workers are excluded in the Affordable Care 
Act. Health professionals must be attuned to the health issues of new immigrants 
so that they can provide better services. In order to raise the health standards 
of America, health professionals must provide healthcare for all, including 
immigrant workers.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) also known as chronic diseases last for a long 
time and progress generally slow. Major non-communicable diseases are 
cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. 
Unhealthy lifestyles and food behaviours play an important role for determining 
such diseases. The change in unhealthy behaviours or the maintenance of healthy 
lifestyles has enormous value in the reduction of diseases and longer life 
expectancy not only on an individual level but for the community as a whole. 
Recent meta-analyses reported Mediterranean diet to be an optimal diet when 
adopted as a whole, in order to preserve and maintain a good health status. A 
greater adherence score to the Mediterranean diet (2-point increase) was related 
to induce an 8% reduction in overall mortality, a 10% reduced risk of CVD and a 
4% reduction in neoplastic diseases. However, there is no direct method in 
quantifying and evaluating adherence, therefore a large number of indirect 
indices in several studies have been proposed, with a last unifying score. 
Recently more and more e-health techniques such as web communication or desktop 
publishing (DVDs and so on) are being used, obtaining good results in the 
Mediterranean diet adherence. For successfully changing the unhealthy lifestyles 
and food behaviours of the population, interventions at all levels are needed 
with the cooperation of Institutions, mass media, agricultural and food industry 
and healthcare professionals guided by expert scientific societies.

BACKGROUND: In adults with acute stroke, infections occur commonly and are 
associated with an unfavourable functional outcome. In the Preventive 
Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS) we aimed to establish whether or not 
preventive antimicrobial therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin, 
ceftriaxone, improves functional outcome in patients with acute stroke.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, open-label trial with masked endpoint 
assessment, patients with acute stroke were randomly assigned to intravenous 
ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g, given every 24 h intravenously for 4 days, in 
addition to stroke unit care, or standard stroke unit care without preventive 
antimicrobial therapy; assignments were made within 24 h after symptom onset. 
The primary endpoint was functional outcome at 3 months, defined according to 
the modified Rankin Scale and analysed by intention to treat. The primary 
analysis was by ordinal regression of the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes 
included death, infection rates, antimicrobial use, and length of hospital stay. 
Participants and caregivers were aware of treatment allocation but assessors of 
outcome were masked to group assignment. This trial is registered with 
controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN66140176.
FINDINGS: Between July 6, 2010, and March 23, 2014, a total of 2550 patients 
from 30 sites in the Netherlands, including academic and non-academic medical 
centres, were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 1275 patients to 
ceftriaxone and 1275 patients to standard treatment (control group). 12 patients 
(seven in the ceftriaxone group and five in the control group) withdrew consent 
immediately after randomisation, leaving 2538 patients available for the 
intention-to-treat-analysis (1268 in the ceftriaxone group and 1270 in the 
control group). 2514 (99%) of 2538 patients (1257 in each group) completed 
3-month follow-up. Preventive ceftriaxone did not affect the distribution of 
functional outcome scores on the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months (adjusted 
common odds ratio 0·95 [95% CI 0·82-1·09], p=0·46). Preventive ceftriaxone did 
not result in an increased occurrence of adverse events. Overgrowth infection 
with Clostridium difficile occurred in two patients (<1%) in the ceftriaxone 
group and none in the control group.
INTERPRETATION: Preventive ceftriaxone does not improve functional outcome at 3 
months in adults with acute stroke. The results of our trial do not support the 
use of preventive antibiotics in adults with acute stroke.

The aim of this study was to compare the overall survival of a large, 
single-center cohort of patients who had differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) 
with that of a matched general population.
METHODS: We analyzed 2,428 consecutive patients who had DTC and underwent 
treatment from 1965 to 2013 at the Department of Nuclear Medicine, University 
Hospital of Münster, Münster, Germany, according to international standards. 
Patients were classified on the basis of the current, seventh edition of the 
American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control 
classification system. Additionally, a subgroup analysis with regard to age at 
diagnosis was performed. The overall survival of the patients was compared with 
the expected survival of the general population on the basis of age and sex, as 
provided by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany.
RESULTS: Compared with the expected survival, the overall survival of patients 
with stage I disease paradoxically was significantly better (P < 0.001). In the 
subgroup analysis, a significantly lower mortality rate was observed in elderly 
patients (≥60 y old) with stage I disease. On the other hand, patients between 
20 and 45 y of age and with distant metastases at diagnosis had a significantly 
increased standardized mortality rate. In contrast, other patients with stage II 
disease and more than 45 y old had a normal mortality rate. The mortality rate 
was significantly increased in all patients with stage IVC disease.
CONCLUSION: Older patients with more limited disease paradoxically had better 
survival than would be expected on the basis of age and sex, whereas young 
adults as well as patients more than 45 y old and with distant metastases had 
increased mortality rates. For all other DTC patients, regardless of age or TNM 
stage, no significant survival difference was seen.

The mycobacterial F0F1-ATP synthase (ATPase) is a validated target for the 
development of tuberculosis (TB) therapeutics. Therefore, a series of eighteen 
novel compounds has been designed, synthesized and evaluated against 
Mycobacterium smegmatis ATPase. The observed ATPase inhibitory activities (IC50) 
of these compounds range between 0.36 and 5.45μM. The lead compound 9d 
[N-(7-chloro-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)-N-(3-((diethylamino)methyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dichlorobenzenesulfonamide] 
with null cytotoxicity (CC50>300μg/mL) and excellent anti-mycobacterial activity 
and selectivity (mycobacterium ATPase IC50=0.51μM, mammalian ATPase IC50>100μM, 
and selectivity >200) exhibited a complete growth inhibition of replicating 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv at 3.12μg/mL. In addition, it also exhibited 
bactericidal effect (approximately 2.4log10 reductions in CFU) in the hypoxic 
culture of non-replicating M. tuberculosis at 100μg/mL (32-fold of its MIC) as 
compared to positive control isoniazid [approximately 0.2log10 reduction in CFU 
at 5μg/mL (50-fold of its MIC)]. The pharmacokinetics of 9d after p.o. and IV 
administration in male Sprague-Dawley rats indicated its quick absorption, 
distribution and slow elimination. It exhibited a high volume of distribution 
(Vss, 0.41L/kg), moderate clearance (0.06L/h/kg), long half-life (4.2h) and low 
absolute bioavailability (1.72%). In the murine model system of chronic TB, 9d 
showed 2.12log10 reductions in CFU in both lung and spleen at 173μmol/kg dose as 
compared to the growth of untreated control group of Balb/C male mice infected 
with replicating M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The in vivo efficacy of 9d is at least 
double of the control drug ethambutol. These results suggest 9d as a promising 
candidate molecule for further preclinical evaluation against resistant TB 
strains.
