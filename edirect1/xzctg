OBJECTIVE: The death of a child is a traumatic stressor that takes a toll on the 
health of parents. This study examined long-term impacts of the death of a child 
on the risk of early mortality in bereaved parents. In a follow-up analysis, a 
twin subsample was analyzed to examine potential genetic confounding.
METHOD: We analyzed data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. 
The primary sample consists of two groups of MIDUS 2 participants (2004-06); (1) 
parents who experienced the death of a child prior to MIDUS 2 (n = 451) and (2) 
comparison parents who had not experienced death of any children (n = 1804) 
(mean age = 63). We also analyzed 52 twin pairs in which one twin experienced 
the death of a child and 271 twin pairs in which both twins had all living 
children. Mortality status of parents was assessed in 2017.
RESULTS: Parents who had experienced the death of a child had a 32% higher 
likelihood of early mortality (defined as dying earlier than life expectancy) 
than their peers who did not have any deceased children, and they were more 
likely to die of heart disease. Analyses of the twin subsample revealed 
significantly lower concordance for early mortality among the pairs with a 
bereaved twin than among control twins, consistent with non-genetic effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the death of a child has lasting impacts 
on the risk of early mortality in bereaved parents. This study provides the 
first U.S. estimate of bereavement effects on mortality extending through the 
parents' full life course, with significant public health implications. In 
addition, analysis of concordance of early death rates in the twin subsample 
suggests the impact on mortality of parental bereavement, net of genetic 
factors.

BACKGROUND: It has been reported that in 62.5% of cases of incurable cancer 
pain, the complaint is due to myofascial pain syndrome. Trigger point injections 
using dibucaine hydrochloride help patients with such cancer pain. This study 
evaluated the efficacy of trigger point injections for alleviating pain in 
patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: Twenty patients with advanced cancer who had a life expectancy of 6 
months or less and had been diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome were treated 
with trigger point injections. Prior to treatment, a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
was used to measure the resting pain level and discomfort upon application of 
pressure on the site of pain. These values were compared with last treatment 
measurements.
RESULTS: The mean pre-treatment VAS scores for pain at rest and upon application 
of pressure on the pain site were 7.3 and 9.0, respectively. These scores 
decreased significantly to 1.95 and 3.2, respectively, after the treatment 
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Trigger point injection is an alternative and effective pain control 
modality for advanced cancer patients with myofascial pain syndrome.

BACKGROUND: A recent study showed that the presence and characteristics of 
myocardial scar could independently predict appropriate implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator therapies and the risk of sudden cardiac death in 
patients receiving a de novo cardiac resynchronisation device.
DESIGN: The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cardiac magnetic 
resonance imaging-based algorithms versus clinical practice in the 
decision-making process for the implantation of a cardiac resynchronisation 
device pacemaker versus cardiac resynchronisation device implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator device in heart failure patients with indication for 
cardiac resynchronisation therapy.
METHODS: An incidental Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime 
progression of a heart failure patient cohort. Key health variables included in 
the model were New York Heart Association functional class, hospitalisations, 
sudden cardiac death and total mortality. The analysis was done from the 
healthcare system perspective. Costs (€2017), survival and quality-adjusted life 
years were assessed.
RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, algorithm I reduced mortality by 39% in patients 
with a cardiac resynchronisation device pacemaker who were underprotected due to 
misclassification by clinical protocol. This approach had the highest 
quality-adjusted life years (algorithm I 3.257 quality-adjusted life years; 
algorithm II 3.196 quality-adjusted life years; clinical protocol 3.167 
quality-adjusted life years) and the lowest lifetime costs per patient (€20,960, 
€22,319 and €28,447, respectively). Algorithm I would improve results for three 
subgroups: non-ischaemic, New York Heart Association class III-IV and ≥65 years 
old. Furthermore, implementing this approach could generate an estimated €702 
million in health system savings annually in European Society of Cardiology 
countries.
CONCLUSION: The application of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-based 
algorithms could improve survival and quality-adjusted life years at a lower 
cost than current clinical practice (dominant strategy) used for assigning 
cardiac resynchronisation device pacemakers and cardiac resynchronisation device 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators to heart failure patients.

A nearly complete skeleton of a new hadrosaurid, Kamuysaurus japonicus gen. et 
sp. nov., was discovered from the outer shelf deposits of the Upper Cretaceous 
Hakobuchi Formation of the Yezo Group in Hobetsu area of Mukawa town in 
Hokkaido, Japan. Kamuysaurus belongs to the sub-clade of Hadrosaurinae, 
Edmontosaurini, and forms a monophyly with Laiyangosaurus and Kerberosaurus from 
the northern Far East. Kamuysaurus has a long anterior platform for the 
nasofrontal sutural surface, which may indicate the presence of a small 
supracranial crest, similar to a sub-adult form of Brachylophosaurus based on 
the extension of the nasofrontal sutural surface. The Dispersal Extinction 
Cladogenesis analysis with the 50% Majority Rule consensus tree suggests that 
the clade of Kamuysaurus, Laiyangosaurus, and Kerberosaurus may have dispersed 
into Asia prior to the late Campanian and the potential endemism of this clade 
during the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian in the northern Far East. The 
results of both Dispersal Extinction Cladogenesis and Ancestral State 
Reconstruction analyses imply that the marine-influenced environment in North 
America during the Campanian may have played an important role for the 
hadrosaurid diversification in its early evolutionary history.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal disease that 
shortens one's life expectancy and reduces the quality of life of patients. The 
current known treatments for COPD can only act to alleviate the symptoms. 
Recently, stem cells have demonstrated efficacy in various medical areas. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using human Wharton's 
jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)s for lung recovery in a COPD mouse 
model.
METHODS: Human Wharton's jelly was obtained during natural delivery or caesarean 
section from healthy women. Wharton's jelly-derived MSC was confirmed with 
expression of CD14, CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105 using flow cytometry. Mice 
model (C57BL/6) of COPD were induced by injecting 10 μL elastase into the 
trachea and they were divided into three treatment groups (sham, vehicle, stem 
cell). The sham group was not induced COPD, nor provided any treatment; the 
vehicle group comprised of COPD-induced mice treated with normal saline; the 
stem cell group comprised of COPD-induced mice treated with Wharton's 
jelly-derived MSCs. The vehicle and mesenchymal stem cells (5 × 104 cells) were 
injected in tail vein 7 days following COPD induction. Mice were euthanized 7 
days after vehicle and stem cell injection, and pathologic findings were 
confirmed. Mean Linear Intercept (MLI) was measured after emphysema-induced 
alveoli were identified.
RESULTS: Cell surface markers were positive for CD105, CD90, and CD73 and 
negative for CD45, CD34, and CD14. Pathological tests showed that COPD-induced 
mice had significantly increased emphysema volume as compared with that in the 
sham group. The degree of emphysema in the stem cell group was reduced based on 
pathologic findings. The mean MLI of the sham group was measured as 
38.85 ± 6.45. The mean MLI of the vehicle and stem cell groups were 
163.05 ± 48.94 and 123.59 ± 30.53, respectively, and there was a statistically 
significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Though the number of mice in the experiment was not large, human 
Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs showed pulmonary regenerative effects in the COPD 
mouse model. Although we cannot confirm the effects of Wharton's jelly-derived 
MSCs in COPD through this experiment, it can be used as a basis for a larger 
clinical experiment.

Environmental noises often affect population dynamics, and hence many benefits 
are gained in using stochastic models since real life is full of stochasticity 
and randomness. In this paper a stochastic extension of a model by Asfaw et al. 
(Int J Biomath 11:1850057, 2018) is considered. Due to the non-linearity of the 
model, first, a simplified stochastic plant-herbivore model is formulated and 
analyzed for its global Lipschitz continuity, positivity, existence and 
uniqueness of solutions. Second, the analysis is extended to a more complex and 
realistic model. Numerical simulations using Euler-Maruyama method are employed 
to demonstrate the long term dynamics. It was found that the noise added to the 
herbivore population resulted more change in the dynamics than the noise added 
to the plant population (food source). Ignoring the environmental noise could 
make the land management and wild life conservation not to maintain their goals.

BACKGROUND: A limited evidence base and lack of clear clinical guidelines 
challenge healthcare systems' adoption of precision medicine. The effect of 
these conditions on demand is not understood.
OBJECTIVE: This research estimated the public's preferences and demand for 
precision medicine outcomes.
METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment survey was conducted with an online sample 
of the US public who had recent healthcare experience. Statistical analysis was 
undertaken using an error components mixed logit model. The responsiveness of 
demand in the context of a changing evidence base was estimated through the 
price elasticity of demand. External validation was examined using real-world 
demand for the 21-gene recurrence score assay for breast cancer.
RESULTS: In total, 1124 (of 1849) individuals completed the web-based survey. 
The most important outcomes were survival gains with statistical uncertainty, 
cost of testing, and medical expert agreement on changing care based on test 
results. The value ($US, year 2017 values) for a test where most (vs. few) 
experts agreed to changing treatment based on test results was $US1100 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 916-1286). Respondents were willing to pay $US265 (95% 
CI 46-486) for a test that could result in greater certainty around 
life-expectancy gains. The predicted demand of the assay was 9% in 2005 and 66% 
in 2014, compared with real-world uptake of 7% and 71% (root-mean-square 
prediction error 0.11). Demand was sensitive to price (1% increase in price 
resulted in > 1% change in demand) when first introduced and insensitive to 
price (1% increase in price resulted in < 0.1% change in demand) as the evidence 
base became established.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of external validity was found. Demand was weak and 
responsive to price in the near term because of uncertainty and an immature 
evidence base. Clear communication of precision medicine outcomes and 
uncertainty is crucial in allowing healthcare to align with individual 
preferences.

In eukaryotes, the organization and function of the microtubule cytoskeleton 
depend on the allocation of different roles to individual microtubules. For 
example, many asymmetrically dividing cells differentially specify microtubule 
behavior at old and new centrosomes. Here we show that yeast spindle pole bodies 
(SPBs, yeast centrosomes) differentially control the plus-end dynamics and 
cargoes of their astral microtubules, remotely from the minus-end. The old SPB 
recruits the kinesin motor protein Kip2, which then translocates to the plus-end 
of the emanating microtubules, promotes their extension and delivers dynein into 
the bud. Kip2 recruitment at the SPB depends on Bub2 and Bfa1, and 
phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Kip2 prevents random lattice binding. Releasing 
Kip2 of its control by SPBs equalizes its distribution, the length of 
microtubules and dynein distribution between the mother cell and its bud. These 
observations reveal that microtubule organizing centers use minus to plus-end 
directed remote control to individualize microtubule function.

INTRODUCTION: Despite its recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration 
and Health Canada, aspiration therapy-one of the latest weight loss 
treatments-remains controversial. Critics have expressed concerns that the 
therapy could lead to bulimia and other binge eating disorders. Meanwhile, 
proponents argue that the therapy is less invasive, reversible, and cheaper than 
bariatric surgery. Cost-effectiveness of this therapy, however, is not yet 
established.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of aspiration therapy relative to 2 most common bariatric 
surgery procedures (gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy) and no treatment over 
a lifetime horizon. Costs were estimated from the health system's perspective 
using US data. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Despite being a cheaper procedure than bariatric surgery, aspiration 
therapy costs more than bariatric surgery in the long term because of its high 
maintenance costs (i.e., periodic replacement of device parts). It also yields 
lower QALYs than bariatric surgery because of its smaller weight loss effects. 
Thus, the therapy is dominated by bariatric surgery. In particular, compared 
with gastric bypass, it costs US$5,318 more and yields 1.31 fewer QALYs. 
However, aspiration therapy is cost-effective relative to no treatment with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$17,532 per QALY gained.
DISCUSSION: Given its high lifetime costs and its modest weight loss effects, 
aspiration therapy is not cost-effective relative to bariatric surgery. However, 
it is a cost-effective treatment option for patients who lack access to 
bariatric surgery.

District, Beijing, China.

There is an increased enthusiasm in treating osteolytic metastatic acetabulum 
via injecting polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) as a bone filler to provide pain 
relief and potential structural support. The aim of this respective study is to 
determine the function and quality of life improvement after cement 
acetabuloplasty.Thirty two patients underwent acetabular cement augmentation 
between May 2014 and March 2018 were respectively reviewed. Isolated 
percutaneous acetabuloplasty (PA) was performed in 15 patients (group A) while 
radiofrequency ablation with PA (RFA-PA) in 12 patients (group B). Together with 
PA, open reconstructive surgery on ipsilateral femur was performed in another 5 
cases (group C). Pre- and posttreatment functional evaluation and quality of 
life (QoL) assessment were carried out.The average followup duration was 11.5 
(range, 3-36) months. None of major complications occurred. 81.2% (26/32) of 
patients achieved complete pain relief. Reduction of pain intensity and 
improvement of functional status achieved significantly differences after 
treatment (P = .00). Significant improvement (P = .00) was observed in scales of 
global QoL and pain-related restrictions in daily activities. Both isolated PA 
and RFA-PA procedures were equally effective towards the improvement of function 
and quality of life (P > .05). Regarding 5 patients in group C, pain intensity 
decreased when loading the affected limb and they could walk with crutches or 
cane.Bone cement acetabuloplasty is an adequate and effective mini-invasive 
procedure to relieve pain, restore function, and enhance the quality of life of 
patients for as long as possible in metastatic patients with short life 
expectancy. Ipsilateral surgery appears to be safe and well tolerated.

IMPORTANCE: With immune recovery following early initiation of antiretroviral 
therapy (ART), the risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation among individuals with 
HIV could be reduced. The current strategy of annual latent TB infection (LTBI) 
testing should be revisited to increase cost-effectiveness and reduce the 
intensity of testing for individuals.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of LTBI testing strategies for 
individuals in Hong Kong with HIV who had negative LTBI test results at 
baseline.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model study using a 
cost-effectiveness analysis included 3130 individuals with HIV in Hong Kong, 
China, which has an intermediate TB burden and a low incidence of HIV-TB 
coinfection. A system dynamics model of individuals with HIV attending a major 
HIV specialist clinic in Hong Kong was developed and parameterized by 
longitudinal clinical and LTBI testing records of patients during a 15-year 
period. The study population was stratified by age group, CD4 lymphocyte level, 
ART status, and right of abode. Alternative strategies for LTBI testing after a 
baseline test were compared with annual testing under different coverages of 
ART, LTBI testing, and LTBI treatment scenarios in the model. An annual 
discounting rate of 3.5% was used in cost-effectiveness analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of new TB cases averted above base case 
scenario, discounted quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYG), incremental 
cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in 2017 to 2023.
RESULTS: A total of 3130 patients with HIV (2740 [87.5%] male and 2800 [89.5%] 
younger than 50 years at HIV diagnosis) with 16 630 person-years of follow-up 
data from 2002 to 2017 were analyzed. Of these, 94 patients (0.67 [95% CI, 
0.51-0.91] per 100 person-years) developed TB. Model estimates of cumulative 
number of TB cases would reach 146 by 2023, with the annual number of new TB 
diagnoses ranging from 6 to 8. For patients who had negative LTBI test results 
at baseline, subsequent LTBI testing strategies were ranked by ascending 
effectiveness as follows: (1) no testing, (2) test by risk factors, (3) biennial 
testing for all, (4) up to 3 tests for all, and (5) annual testing for all. 
Applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALYG, none of the 
subsequent testing strategies were cost-effective. Test by risk factors and up 
to 3 tests for all were cost-effective only if the willingness-to-pay threshold 
was increased to $100 000 per QALYG and $200 000 per QALYG, respectively. More 
new TB cases would be averted by expanding LTBI testing and/or treatment 
coverage.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Changing the current testing strategy to less intense 
testing strategies is likely to be cost-effective in the presence of an 
increased coverage of baseline LTBI testing and/or treatment.

Objective: Uncontrolled asthma is associated with considerable clinical burden 
and costs to payers and patients. US economic models evaluating biologics using 
data from clinical trials demonstrate high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs), but the cost-effectiveness based on real-world treatment patterns is 
unknown. This analysis used real-world evidence to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of adding omalizumab to standard of care (SOC).Methods: A Markov model was 
applied to track patients' health states in 2-week cycles, comparing costs and 
treatment effects of SOC alone versus SOC + omalizumab over a lifetime (US payer 
perspective). Outcomes included exacerbation events, life years, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total costs, and an ICER. Patient 
characteristics, exacerbations, patient-reported outcomes, and work productivity 
were derived from the real-world PROSPERO (Prospective Study to Evaluate 
Predictors of Clinical Effectiveness in Response to Omalizumab) study. Published 
literature informed mortality, exacerbation-related disutility, and unit costs. 
Sensitivity analyses assessed model robustness.Results: Over a lifetime horizon, 
omalizumab was associated with an increase of 2.0 QALYs at a cost of $US 148,319 
in patients with uncontrolled asthma (ICER of $75,319/QALY gained) and a 
reduction in exacerbations of 6.0 events/patient. Accounting for responder 
status improved the ICER ($70,505/QALY); incorporating indirect costs further 
reduced the ICER. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses confirmed that 
the base case outcome was robust to variation in inputs.Conclusions: Based on 
real-world outcomes, omalizumab may be cost-effective for uncontrolled asthma 
from the US payer perspective. Including broader evidence on treatment 
discontinuation, caregiver burden, and oral corticosteroid reduction from 
real-world studies may better reflect the effects and value of omalizumab for 
all healthcare stakeholders.

Objectives: Metamodels have been used to approximate complex simulations and 
have many applications with sensitivity analysis, optimization, etc. However, 
their use in health economics is very limited. Application of artificial neural 
network (ANN) with a health economic model has never been investigated. The 
study intends to introduce ANN as a metamodeling method to conduct sensitivity 
analysis in a total hip replacement decision analytical model and compare its 
performance with two other counterparts. Methods: First, a nonlinear factor 
screening method was adopted to screen out unimportant factors from the 
simulation. Second, an ANN was developed using the important variables to 
approximate the simulation. Performance of the ANN metamodel was then compared 
with its Gaussian Process (GP) and multiple linear regression (MLR) 
counterparts. Results: Out of 31, the factor screening method identified 12 
important variables from the simulation. ANN metamodels showed best predictive 
capabilities in terms of performance measures (mean squared error of prediction, 
MSEP and mean absolute percentage deviation, MAPD) used for predicting both 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for two prostheses. Conclusion: 
The study provides a methodological development in sensitivity analysis and 
demonstrates that an ANN metamodel is a potential approximation method for 
computationally expensive health economic simulations.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of community health worker (CHW)-based 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-reduction interventions is not well 
established. Colorado Heart Healthy Solutions is a CHW-based intervention 
designed to reduce modifiable CVD risk factors. This program has previously 
demonstrated success, but the cost-effectiveness is unknown. CHW-based 
interventions are potentially attractive complements to healthcare delivery 
because laypersons implement the intervention at a lower cost relative to 
medical care and may be attractive in rural settings with limited clinical 
resources.
METHODS: CHWs performed screenings and provided ongoing participant support 
within predominantly rural communities. A point-of-service software tool was 
used to generate 10-year Framingham CVD risk scores and assist CHWs to make 
medical referrals and provide ongoing individualized support for lifestyle 
changes. A sample of program participants returned for reassessment of risk 
factors. We calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and program 
costs using a Markov model. Transition probabilities were calculated using 
Framingham risk equations or derived from the literature using the observed mean 
reduction in 10-year CVD risk score over of 37- months follow-up. Program 
cost-effectiveness was calculated for both at-risk (abnormal baseline CVD risk 
factors) and overall program populations.
RESULTS: The base-case scenario evaluating a 52-year-old male participant 
revealed an incremental cost savings of $3576 and a gain of 0.16 QALYs 
associated with the intervention. Cost savings were greater in at-risk 
populations. The economic dominance of the model was robust in multiple 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: A community-based CVD intervention demonstrated to reduce CVD risk 
is cost-effective. This suggests that population-based public health programs 
may have the potential to complement primary care preventative services to 
improve health and reduce the burden of traditional medical care.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with a dismal 
prognosis. The average life expectancy of untreated patients with IPF is only 3 
to 4 years. Decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with IPF appears 
to be almost linear, with patients with well-preserved FVC at baseline 
experiencing the same rate of decline in FVC as patients with more advanced 
disease. Two antifibrotic therapies have been approved for the treatment of IPF: 
nintedanib and pirfenidone. These drugs slow decline in lung function and reduce 
the risk of acute respiratory deteriorations, which are associated with very 
high morbidity and mortality. Individual clinical trials have not been powered 
to show reductions in mortality, but analyses of pooled data from clinical 
trials, as well as observational studies, suggest that antifibrotic therapies 
improve life expectancy. Despite this, many individuals with IPF remain 
untreated. In many cases, this is because the physician perceives that the 
disease is stable and so does not warrant therapy, or has concerns over the 
potential side-effects of antifibrotic drugs. There remains a need to educate 
pulmonologists that IPF is a progressive, irreversible and fatal disease and 
that prompt treatment is critical to preserving patients' lung function and 
improving outcomes. Most individuals can tolerate antifibrotic therapy, and dose 
adjustment has been shown to be effective at reducing side effects without 
compromising efficacy. In addition to anti-fibrotic therapies, individuals with 
IPF benefit from a holistic approach to their care that includes symptom 
management and supportive care tailored to the needs of the individual. An 
animation illustrating the themes covered in this article will be available at:

OBJECTIVES: Assessing the cost-effectiveness credentials of this intervention in 
patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) 
compared with usual medical therapy.
DESIGN: A Markov model comprising two health states (ie, alive or dead) was 
constructed. The transition probabilities were directly derived from published 
Kaplan-Meier curves of the pivotal randomised controlled trial and extrapolated 
over the cohort's lifetime using recommended methods. Costs of catheter 
ablation, outpatient consultations, hospitalisation, medications and 
examinations were included. Resource use and unit costs were sourced from 
government websites or published literature. A lifetime horizon and a healthcare 
system perspective were taken. All costs and benefits were discounted at 3% 
annually. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were 
run around the key model parameters to test the robustness of the base case 
results.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical Australian cohort of patients with concomitant AF 
and HF who are resistant to antiarrhythmic treatment.
INTERVENTIONS: Catheter ablation versus medical therapy.
RESULTS: The catheter ablation was associated with a cost of $A44 377 per 
person, in comparison to $A28 506 for the medical therapy alone over a lifetime. 
Catheter ablation contributed to 4.58 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
6.99 LY gains compared with 4.30 QALYs and 6.53 LY gains, respectively, in the 
medical therapy arm. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $A55 942/QALY 
or $A35 020/LY. The DSA showed that results were highly sensitive to costs of 
ablation and time horizon. The PSA yielded very consistent results with the base 
case.
CONCLUSIONS: Offering catheter ablation procedure to patients with systematic 
paroxysmal or persistent AF who failed to respond to antiarrhythmic drugs was 
associated with higher costs, greater benefits. When compared with medical 
therapy alone, this intervention is not cost-effective from an Australia 
healthcare system perspective.

BACKGROUND: The relative effects of combinations of CKD, heart disease, and 
stroke on risk of mortality, direct medical costs, and life expectancy are 
unknown.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of 506,849 Chinese adults in Hong Kong 
with hypertension, we used Cox regressions to examine associations between 
all-cause mortality and combinations of moderate CKD (eGFR of 30-59 ml/min per 
1.73 m2), severe CKD (eGFR of 15-29 ml/min per 1.73 m2), heart disease (coronary 
heart disease or heart failure), and stroke, and modeling to estimate annual 
public direct medical costs and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 5.8 years (2.73 million person-years), 
55,666 deaths occurred. Having an increasing number of comorbidities was 
associated with incremental increases in mortality risk and medical costs and 
reductions in life expectancy. Compared with patients who had neither CKD nor 
cardiovascular disease, patients with one, two, or three conditions (heart 
disease, stroke, and moderate CKD) had relative risk of mortality increased by 
about 70%, 160%, and 290%, respectively; direct medical costs increased by about 
70%, 160%, and 280%, respectively; and life expectancy at age 60 years decreased 
by about 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Burdens were higher with severe CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated extremely high mortality risk and medical 
cost increases for severe CKD, exceeding the combined effects from heart disease 
and stroke. Mortality risks and costs for moderate CKD, heart disease, and 
stroke were similar individually and roughly multiplicative for any combination. 
These findings suggest that to reduce mortality and health care costs in 
patients with hypertension, CKD prevention and intervention merits priority 
equal to that of cardiovascular disease.

The lung is a complex ecosystem of host cells and microbes often disrupted in 
pathological conditions. Although bacteria have been hypothesized as agents of 
carcinogenesis, little is known about microbiota profile of the most prevalent 
cancer subtypes: adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). To 
characterize lung cancer (LC) microbiota a first a screening was performed 
through a pooled sequencing approach of 16S ribosomal RNA gene (V3-V6) using a 
total of 103 bronchoalveaolar lavage fluid samples. Then, identified taxa were 
used to inspect 1009 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas and to annotate tumor 
unmapped RNAseq reads. Microbial diversity was analyzed per cancer subtype, 
history of cigarette smoking and airflow obstruction, among other clinical data. 
We show that LC microbiota is enriched in Proteobacteria and more diverse in SCC 
than ADC, particularly in males and heavier smokers. High frequencies of 
Proteobacteria were found to discriminate a major cluster, further subdivided 
into well-defined communities' associated with either ADC or SCC. Here, a SCC 
subcluster differing from other cases by a worse survival was correlated with 
several Enterobacteriaceae. Overall, this study provides first evidence for a 
correlation between lung microbiota and cancer subtype and for its influence on 
patient life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis require treatment 
options that maintain efficacy and tolerability during extended treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety 
of brodalumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody, 
in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
METHODS: Patients who completed a 12-week, phase II, dose-ranging clinical trial 
received brodalumab 210 mg every 2 weeks in an open-label extension study. 
Efficacy was assessed by static physician's global assessment (sPGA) and 
psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Quality of life, assessed by 
dermatology life quality index (DLQI), and safety were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Overall, 181 patients received brodalumab for a median of 264 weeks. 
Brodalumab treatment resulted in rapid improvements in sPGA, PASI, and DLQI that 
were maintained through week 264. Achieving PASI 90 to < 100 or PASI 100 at 
weeks 12, 240, and 264 was associated with greater likelihood for DLQI 0 or 1 
compared with achieving PASI 75 to < 90. Over 5 years, one adverse event of 
suicidal ideation was reported, no suicides occurred, and no new safety signals 
emerged.
CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab demonstrated skin clearance and improved quality of 
life, with an acceptable safety profile, throughout 5 years of treatment.
