BACKGROUND: Microsporidia are a group of intracellular parasitic eukaryotes, 
serious pathogens that cause widespread infection in humans, vertebrates, and 
invertebrates. Because microsporidia have a thick spore wall structure, the in 
vitro transformation, cell culture, and genetic operation technology of 
microsporidia are far behind that of other parasites.
METHODS: In this study, according to an analysis of the life-cycle of 
microsporidia, Nosema bombycis, and different electro-transformation conditions, 
the transduction efficiency of introducing foreign genes into N. bombycis was 
systematically determined.
RESULTS: We analyzed the direct electro-transformation of foreign genes into 
germinating N. bombycis using reporters under the regulation of different 
characteristic promoters. Furthermore, we systematically determined the 
efficiency of electro-transformation into N. bombycis under different 
electro-transformation conditions and different developmental stages through an 
analysis of the whole life-cycle of N. bombycis. These results revealed that 
foreign genes could be effectively introduced through a perforation voltage of 
100 V pulsed for 15 ms during the period of N. bombycis sporeplasm 
proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: We present an effective method for electro-transformation of a 
plasmid encoding a fluorescent protein into N. bombycis, which provides new 
insight for establishing genetic modifications and potential applications in 
these intracellular parasites.

Pterosaurs thrived in and around water for 160 + million years but their 
take-off from water is poorly understood. A purportedly low floating position 
and forward centre of gravity barred pterosaurs from a bird-like bipedal running 
launch. Quadrupedal water launch similar to extant water-feeding birds and bats 
has been proposed for the largest pterosaurs, such as Anhanguera and 
Quetzalcoatlus. However, quadrupedal water launch has never been demonstrated in 
smaller pterosaurs, including those living around the Tethys Sea in the Late 
Jurassic Solnhofen Lagoon. Using Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence, we singled out 
aurorazhdarchid specimen MB.R.3531 that alone preserved specific soft tissues 
among more than a dozen well-preserved Solnhofen pterosaur specimens. These soft 
tissues pertain to primary propulsive contact surfaces needed for quadrupedal 
water launch (pedal webbing and soft tissues from an articulated forelimb) that 
permit robust calculations of its dynamic feasibility without the need to make 
assumptions about contact areas. A first-principles-based dynamics model of 
MB.R.3531 reveals that quadrupedal water launch was theoretically feasible and 
that webbed feet significantly impacted launch performance. Three key factors 
limiting water launch performance in all pterosaurs are identified, providing a 
foundation for understanding water launch evolution: available propulsive 
contact area, forelimb extension range and forelimb extension power about the 
shoulder.

Klotho is a life extension factor that has the ability to regulate the function 
of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), whose dysfunction 
in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) underlies critical aspects of the pathophysiology 
of major depression. Here, we study the functional relevance of klotho in the 
pathogenesis of depression. A chronic social defeat stress paradigm, in which 
mice are categorized as either susceptible or unsusceptible based on their 
performance in a social interaction test, was used in this study. We found that 
the expression of klotho was largely decreased in the NAc of susceptible mice 
compared to control or unsusceptible mice. Genetic knockdown of klotho in the 
NAc induced behavioral alterations relevant to depression in naive mice, while 
overexpression of klotho produced an antidepressive effect in normal mice and 
ameliorated the behavioral responses to stress in susceptible mice. Molecularly, 
knockdown of klotho in the NAc resulted in selective decreases in total and 
synaptic GluN2B expression that were identical to those in susceptible mice. 
Elevation of klotho in the NAc reversed the reductions in GluN2B expressions and 
altered synaptic transmission and spine density in the NAc of susceptible mice. 
Furthermore, blockade of GluN2B with a specific antagonist abolished the 
beneficial effects of klotho elevation in susceptible mice. Collectively, we 
demonstrated that klotho in the NAc modulates behavioral responses to stress by 
regulating the function of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. These results reveal a 
novel role for klotho in the pathogenesis of depression, providing new insights 
into the molecular basis of major depression.

An encephalocele is a congenital tube defect in which there is an extension of 
intracranial structures outside the normal confines of the skull. Its 
presentation at birth provokes a lot of anxiety amongst parents, guardians and 
care providers with regards to compatibility with life, surgical treatments and 
effects on developmental milestones and higher mental functions. This report is 
on our initial experience in the first six months following surgical treatment 
of four consecutive cases presenting in infancy. The aim of this case series is 
to report our initial experience of the management of encephaloceles using four 
consecutive cases that presented in infancy. A review of four infants who 
presented to our neurosurgery service was conducted including patterns of 
presentation, neuroimaging findings, scope of surgical intervention and 
neurological outcome at the six-month review. The results are presented in short 
case reports and summarized in a table. Two five-month-old females, one 
six-month-old female and one two-month-old female infants presented to our 
neurosurgery clinic with progressively increasing encephaloceles at different 
locations. Brain MRI revealed meningo-encephalocele in all, but with associated 
hydrocephalus in two cases only. They all had excision and repair of 
encephalocele under the same general anaesthesia while only two had a 
ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Developmental milestones were on course at 6 
months follow-up following discharge. Although the presentation of 
encephaloceles can be frightening to parents and care providers, careful 
clinical and radiological evaluation is a recipe for sound surgical planning and 
improved outcome.

The contribution of organelles to neural development has received increasing 
attention. Studies have shown that organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and endosomes play important roles in neurogenesis. 
Specifically, metabolic switching, reactive oxygen species production, 
mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, and the 
interaction between mitochondria and the ER all have roles in neurogenesis. 
Lysosomes and endosomes can regulate neurite growth and extension. Moreover, 
metabolic reprogramming represents a novel strategy for generating functional 
neurons. Accordingly, the exploration and application of mechanisms underlying 
metabolic reprogramming will be beneficial for neural conversion and 
regenerative medicine. There is adequate evidence implicating the dysfunction of 
cellular organelles-especially mitochondria-in neurodegenerative disorders, and 
that improvement of mitochondrial function may reverse the progression of these 
diseases through the reinforcement of adult neurogenesis. Therefore, these 
organelles have potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the function of these 
organelles, especially mitochondria, in neural development, focusing on their 
potential as therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis.

INTRODUCTION: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection management has 
recently become more successful. While the life expectancy of HIV-infected 
patients increased, the prevalence of non-acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome-defining cancers, such as gastric cancer, also increased. Helicobacter 
pylori is associated with gastric cancer, the most common cancer and the fourth 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in South Korea, which has the highest 
incidence of chronic gastric mucosa inflammation. Here, the seroprevalence and 
risk factors of H. pylori infection in Korean HIV-infected patients were 
evaluated.
METHODS: Three hundred HIV-infected patients attending the Outpatient Department 
of Pusan National University Hospital were prospectively enrolled from October 
2018 to February 2019. Socio-demographic information was evaluated using 
questionnaires, and the serological status of H. pylori infection was analyzed 
for anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies.
RESULTS: The overall seropositivity of H. pylori was 32.7%, and 254 patients 
(84.7%) were male. The risk factors significantly associated with H. pylori 
seropositivity were: age of 40-49 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.00; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.30-19.17), age of 50-59 years (OR = 3.93; 95% CI 1.05-14.73), 
CD4 cell counts of 350-500/μL (OR = 4.23; 95% CI 1.53-11.65), CD4 cell counts 
≥500/μL (OR = 2.78; 95% CI 1.15-6.72), and a weekly average alcohol consumption 
of at least one alcoholic beverage (OR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.05-2.99).
CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of H. pylori is significantly associated with 
alcohol consumption, high CD4 cell count, and the age group of 40-59 years.

BACKGROUND: Advances in medical science coupled with increased people's income 
results an elevated average of life expectancy even in the resource poor 
countries. The growing number of aged population, however, has drawn little 
attention in health system discourse of low- and Middle-Income Countries 
(LMICs). Nevertheless, ensuring availability of appropriate service and properly 
trained and skilled health workforce is an absolute necessity for a functional 
geriatric and palliative healthcare. Given the lack of specialist geriatricians 
in LMICs contexts, there are other health workforce strategies that might be 
effective in building a proper health system response to this growing demand. 
Therefore, we aimed to identify and synthesize evidence on the existing health 
workforce-related strategies taken to provide geriatric and palliative care in 
LMICs.
METHODS: We will follow the recommendations provided by the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Following the 
PRISMA guidelines, we will search the Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and 
Cochrane database from January 2011 to December 2021 using a comprehensive 
search strategy. Two independent reviewers will screen the title and abstracts 
text using the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the finally 
included articles, full manuscripts will be retrieved, and reviewers will 
appraise and extract data using standardized form independently. The third 
reviewer will resolve any disagreements appear in the process. The findings of 
the review be synthesized using the narrative synthesis approach to analyse 
descriptive quantitative and qualitative data. Furthermore, meta-analysis will 
be done provided that the data meet certain requirement as per Cochrane 
guideline. Rayyan software will be used to manage and synthesize data. Revman 
software will be used to do meta-analysis, if data support.
RESULTS: Findings of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review will identify the existing effective 
strategies taken to provide geriatric and palliative care, in LMICs.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of the encephalitis 
burden along with its attributable risk factors at the national, regional, and 
global levels, which may be helpful in guiding targeted prevention and treatment 
programs.
METHODS: Based on available data sources, the incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of encephalitis in 204 countries and 
regions from 1990 to 2019 were reconstructed by the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019 using the Cause of Death Ensemble model, spatiotemporal Gaussian 
process regression, and DisMod-MR 2.1. We conducted a systematic analysis on the 
epidemiological characteristics of encephalitis in detail by gender, region, and 
age over the past three decades.
RESULTS: Globally, 1,444,720 incident cases, 89,900 deaths, and 4.80 million 
DALYs related to encephalitis were estimated in 2019. The age-standardized 
incidence rate and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) decreased from 23.17 
and 2.18 to 19.33 and 1.19 per 100,000 person-years over the past 30 years, 
respectively. However, beginning in 2011-2013, the burden of encephalitis has 
shown an inflection point, with a further decline of the ASRs ceasing. Lower 
socio-demographic index (SDI) regions in South Asia, Western and Eastern 
Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest burden of encephalitis in 2019. During the 
past three decades, most countries of South Asia achieved significant control of 
the burden. In contrast, developed countries with a higher SDI have shown a 
notable increase in ASMR and age-standardized DALYs rate. Children and older 
adults have always been high-risk groups for encephalitis.
CONCLUSION: Although the global burden of encephalitis has decreased in the past 
30 years, a further decline stopped from 2011 to 2013. The diverse burden in 
different regions calls for differentiated management, and the persistent high 
burden in some low-SDI regions and the increased burden in developed countries 
with higher SDIs deserve more attention.

During the last two decades, there has been increasing concerns about the 
presence of antibiotics in aquatic environments. Phenicol antibiotics, such as 
chloramphenicol (CMP), commonly used in the veterinary and aquaculture fields to 
treat infections, have been often detected in aquatic environments, but scarce 
ecotoxicity information regarding the effects of CMP on non-target aquatic 
organisms is available, and multigenerational studies are seldom studied. Here 
we quantified the demographic responses of Brachionus calyciflorus exposed to 
sublethal concentrations (0, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 mg L-1) of CMP for three 
successive generations (P0, F1, and F2). Our results showed that compared to the 
control, higher concentrations of CMP significantly decreased the life 
expectancy at hatching, generation time, net reproductive rate and intrinsic 
rate of population increase in all three generations, and the proportion of 
mictic offspring in the F1 generation of B. calyciflorus. With increasing 
generations, higher concentrations of CMP showed increased toxic effects on life 
expectancy at hatching and net reproductive rate, but irregular negative effects 
on generation time, intrinsic rate of population increase, and proportion of 
mictic offspring of the rotifers. These results indicate that multigenerational 
studies are necessary to prevent insufficient assessments of the impact of 
antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems.

(1) Background: The impact of imaging-derived ischemia is still under debate and 
the role of stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (spCMR) in non-high-risk 
patient still needs to be clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
impact of spCMR in a case series of stable long-standing chronic coronary 
syndrome (CCS) patients with ischemia and no other risk factor. (2) Methods: 
This is a historical prospective study including 35 patients with history of 
long-standing CCS who underwent coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and additional 
adenosine spCMR. Clinical and imaging findings were included in the analysis. 
Primary outcomes were HF (heart failure) and all major cardiac events (MACE) 
including death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or 
hospitalization for unstable angina, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. (3) 
Results: Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (IQR: from 1 to 6). Mean ejection fraction 
was 61 ± 8%. Twelve patients (31%) referred primary outcomes. Probability of 
experiencing primary outcomes based on symptoms was 62% and increased to 67% and 
91% when multivessel disease and ischemia, respectively, were considered. Higher 
ischemic burden was predictive of disease progression (OR: 1.59, 95%CI: 
1.18-2.14; p-value = 0.002). spCMR model resulted non inferior to the model 
comprising all variables (4) Conclusions: In vivo spCMR-modeling including 
perfusion and strain anomalies could represent a powerful tool in long-standing 
CCS, even when conventional imaging predictors are missing.

The stem cell theory of aging postulates that stem cells become inefficient at 
maintaining the original functions of the tissues. We, therefore, hypothesized 
that transplanting young bone marrow (BM) to old recipients would lead to 
rejuvenating effects on immunity, followed by improved general health, decreased 
frailty, and possibly life span extension. We developed a murine model of 
non-myeloablative heterochronic BM transplantation in which old female BALB/c 
mice at 14, 16, and 18(19) months of age received altogether 125.1 ± 15.6 
million nucleated BM cells from young male donors aged 7-13 weeks. At 21 months, 
donor chimerism was determined, and the immune system's innate and adaptive arms 
were analyzed. Mice were then observed for general health and frailty until 
spontaneous death, when their lifespan, post-mortem examinations, and 
histopathological changes were recorded. The results showed that the old mice 
developed on average 18.7 ± 9.6% donor chimerism in the BM and showed certain 
improvements in their innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, such as 
favorable counts of neutrophils in the spleen and BM, central memory Th cells, 
effector/effector memory Th and Tc cells in the spleen, and B1a and B1b cells in 
the peritoneal cavity. Borderline enhanced lymphocyte proliferation capacity was 
also seen. The frailty parameters, pathomorphological results, and life spans 
did not differ significantly in the transplanted vs. control group of mice. In 
conclusion, although several favorable effects are obtained in our heterochronic 
non-myeloablative transplantation model, additional optimization is needed for 
better rejuvenation effects.

Prion diseases are progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorders with 
a low incidence (1.5-2 cases per million per year). Genetic (10-15%), acquired 
(anecdotal) and sporadic (85%) forms of the disease have been described. The 
clinical spectrum of prion diseases is very varied, although the most common 
symptoms are rapidly progressive dementia, cerebellar ataxia and myoclonus. Mean 
life expectancy from the onset of symptoms is 6 months. There are currently 
diagnostic criteria based on clinical phenotype, as well as neuroimaging 
biomarkers (magnetic resonance imaging), neurophysiological tests 
(electroencephalogram and polysomnogram), and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers 
(14-3-3 protein and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC)). The 
sensitivity and specificity of some of these tests (electroencephalogram and 
14-3-3 protein) is under debate and the applicability of other tests, such as 
RT-QuIC, is not universal. However, the usefulness of these biomarkers beyond 
the most frequent prion disease, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, remains 
unclear. Therefore, research is being carried out on new, more efficient 
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (total tau, ratio total tau/phosphorylated tau 
and neurofilament light chain) and potential blood biomarkers (neurofilament 
light chain, among others) to try to universalize access to early diagnosis in 
the case of prion diseases.

Seafood is essential to a healthy and varied diet due to its highly nutritious 
characteristics. However, seafood products are highly perishable, which results 
in financial losses and quality concerns for consumers and the industry. Due to 
changes in consumer concerns, demand for healthy products has increased. New 
trends focusing on reducing synthetic preservatives require innovation and the 
application of additional or alternative strategies to extend the shelf life of 
this type of product. Currently, refrigeration and freezing storage are the most 
common methods for fish preservation. However, refrigeration alone cannot 
provide long shelf-life periods for fish, and freezing worsens sensorial 
characteristics and consumer interest. Therefore, the need to preserve seafood 
for long periods without exposing it to freezing temperatures exists. This 
review focuses on the application of other approaches to seafood products, such 
as biodegradable films and coating technology; superchilling; irradiation; 
high-pressure processing; hyperbaric storage; and biopreservation with lactic 
acid bacteria, bacteriocins, or bacteriophages. The efficiency of these 
techniques is discussed based on their impact on microbiological quality, 
sensorial degradation, and overall preservation of the product's nutritional 
properties. Although these techniques are already known, their use in the 
industrial processing of seafood is not widespread. Thus, the novelty of this 
review is the aggregation of recent studies on shelf life extension approaches, 
which provide useful information for the selection of the most appropriate 
technology and procedures and industrial innovation. Despite the fact that all 
techniques inhibit or delay bacterial proliferation and product decay, an 
undesirable sensory impact may occur depending on the treatment conditions. 
Although no technique appears to replace refrigeration, the implementation of 
additional treatments in the seafood processing operation could reduce the need 
for freezing, extending the shelf life of fresh unfrozen products.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate differences in local tumor control (LC), symptoms and 
quality of life (QOL) of 261 patients with VS after stereotactic 
radiosurgery/hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS/HFSRT) vs. 
fractionated radiotherapy (FRT) vs. fractionated proton therapy (FPT) were 
studied.
METHODS: For SRS/HFSRT (n = 149), the median fraction dose applied was 12 Gy. 
For FRT (n = 87) and FPT (n = 25), the median cumulative doses applied were 57.6 
Gy and 54 Gy (RBE), respectively. FRT and FPT used single median doses of 1.8 
Gy/Gy (RBE). Median follow-up was 38 months. We investigated dosimetry for 
organs at risk and analyzed toxicity and QOL by sending out a questionnaire.
RESULTS: LC was 99.5% at 12 months after RT with no statistical difference 
between treatment groups (p = 0.19). LC was significantly lower in NF2 patients 
(p = 0.004) and in patients with higher tumor extension grade (p = 0.039). The 
hearing preservation rate was 97% at 12 months after RT with no statistical 
difference between treatment groups (p = 0.31). Facial and trigeminal nerve 
affection after RT occurred as mild symptoms with highest toxicity rate in FPT 
patients.
CONCLUSION: SRS/HFSRT, FRT and FPT for VS show similar overall clinical and 
functional outcomes. Cranial nerve impairment rates vary, potentially due to 
selection bias with larger VS in the FRT and FPT group.

Platelets constitute a major reservoir of platelet-derived growth factor B 
(PDGFB) and are continuously activated in the tumor microenvironment, exposing 
tumors to the plethora of growth factors contained in platelet granules. To 
address the specific role of platelet-derived PDGFB in the tumor 
microenvironment, we have created a mouse model with conditional knockout of 
PDGFB in platelets (pl-PDGFB KO). Lack of PDGFB in platelets resulted in 10-fold 
lower PDGFB concentration in the tumor microenvironment, fewer cancer-associated 
fibroblasts and reduced deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules 
fibronectin and collagen I in the orthotopic RIP1-Tag2 model for pancreatic 
neuroendocrine cancer. Myosin light chain phosphorylation, promoting cell 
contraction and, consequently, the mechano-induced release of active 
transforming growth factor (TGF) β from extracellular compartments, was reduced 
in tumors from pl-PDGFB KO mice. In agreement, TGFβ signaling, measured as 
phosphorylated Smad2, was significantly hampered in tumors from mice lacking 
PDGFB in their platelets, providing a plausible explanation for the reduced 
deposition of extracellular matrix. These findings indicate a major contribution 
of platelet-derived PDGFB to a malignant transformation of the tumor 
microenvironment and address for the first time the role of PDGFB released 
specifically from platelets in the remodeling of the ECM in tumors.

(1) Introduction: Primary intraosseous osteolytic meningiomas (PIOM) are 
non-dural-based tumors predominantly presenting an osteolytic component with or 
without hyperostotic reactions. They are a subset of primary extradural 
meningiomas (PEM). In this study, we present a peculiar case with a systematic 
literature review and propose a new classification considering the limitations 
of previous classification systems. (2) Materials and Methods: Using a 
systematic search protocol in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases, we 
extracted all case studies on PIOM published from inception to December 2020. A 
46-year-old female patient form Dhaka, Bangladesh, was also described. The 
search protocol was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. (3) Results: Here, we 
present a 46-year-old female patient with PIOM who successfully underwent 
bifrontal craniotomy and gross total removal (GTR) of the tumor. At 6-month 
follow-up, no tumor recurrence was shown. Including our new case, 55 total cases 
from 47 articles were included in the analysis. PIOMs were in closer frequency 
among males (56.4%) and females (43.6%). The most common tumor location was the 
frontal and parietal calvarium, most commonly in the frontal bone (29.1%). 
Surgical resection was the predominant modality of treatment (87.3%); only 1.8% 
of patients were treated with radiotherapy, and 5.4% received a combination of 
surgery and radiotherapy. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 80% of 
cases. Extracranial extension was reported in 41.8% of cases, dural invasion in 
47.3%, and recurrence in 7.3%. Whole-body 68 Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT has also been 
reported as a useful tool both for differential diagnosis, radiotherapy 
contouring, and follow-up. Current treatments such as hydroxyurea and 
bevacizumab have variable success rates. We have also suggested a new 
classification which would provide a simple common ground for further research 
in this field. (4) Conclusions: Surgical resection, especially GTR, is the 
treatment of choice for PIOM, with a high GTR rate and low risk of complications 
and mortality. More research is needed on the differential diagnosis and 
specific treatment of PIOM.

Spine represents the most common site for metastatic disease involvement. Due to 
the close relationship between the spinal cord and critical structures, 
therapeutical management of metastatic spinal cord disease remains challenging. 
Spinal localization can lead to neurological sequelae, which can significantly 
affect the quality of life in patients with a limited life expectancy. The 
authors conducted a systematic literature review according to PRISMA guidelines 
in order to determine the impact of the most updated palliative care on spinal 
metastases. The initial literature search retrieved 2526 articles, manually 
screened based on detailed exclusion criteria. Finally, 65 studies met the 
inclusion criteria and were finally included in the systematic review. In the 
wide scenario of palliative care, nowadays, recent medical or surgical 
treatments represent valuable options for ameliorating pain and improving 
patients QoL in such this condition.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, the effects of social and health indicators affecting 
the number of cases and deaths of the COVID-19 pandemic were examined. For the 
determinants of the number of cases and deaths, four models consisting of social 
and health indicators were created.
METHODS: In this quantitative research, 93 countries in the model were used to 
obtain determinants of the confirmed cases and determinants of the COVID-19 
fatalities.
RESULTS: The results obtained from Model I, in which the number of cases was 
examined with social indicators, showed that the number of tourists, the 
population between the ages of 15 and 64, and institutionalization had a 
positive effect on the number of cases. The results obtained from the health 
indicators of the number of cases show that cigarette consumption affects the 
number of cases positively in the 50th quantile, the death rate under the age of 
five affects the number of cases negatively in all quantiles, and vaccination 
positively affects the number of cases in 25th and 75th quantile values. 
Findings from social indicators of the number of COVID-19 deaths show that life 
expectancy negatively affects the number of deaths in the 25th and 50th 
quantiles. The population over the age of 65 and CO2 positively affect the 
number of deaths at the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles. There is a non-linear 
relationship between the number of cases and the number of deaths at the 50th 
and 75th quantile values. An increase in the number of cases increases the 
number of deaths to the turning point; after the turning point, an increase in 
the number of cases decreases the death rate. Herd immunity has an important 
role in obtaining this finding. As a health indicator, it was seen that the 
number of cases positively affected the number of deaths in the 50th and 75th 
quantile values and the vaccination rate in the 25th and 75th quantile values. 
Diabetes affects the number of deaths positively in the 75th quantile.
CONCLUSION: The population aged 15-64 has a strong impact on COVID-19 cases, but 
in COVID-19 deaths, life expectancy is a strong variable. On the other hand, it 
has been found that vaccination and the number of cases interaction term has an 
effect on the mortality rate. The number of cases has a non-linear effect on the 
number of deaths.

Diarrheal diseases due to foodborne Escherichia coli are the leading cause of 
illness in humans. Here, we performed pathogenic typing, molecular typing, and 
antimicrobial susceptibility tests on seventy-five isolates of E. coli isolated 
from stool samples of patients suffering from foodborne diseases in Busan, South 
Korea. All the isolates were identified as E. coli by both biochemical analysis 
(API 20E system) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight 
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The bacteria displayed entero-pathogenic E. 
coli (EPEC) (47.0%), entero-aggregative E. coli (EAEC) (33.3%), entero-toxigenic 
E. coli (ETEC) (6.6%), ETEC and EPEC (6.6%), EPEC and EAEC (4%), and ETEC and 
EAEC (2.7%) characteristics. The E. coli isolates were highly resistant to 
nalidixic acid (44.0%), tetracycline (41.3%), ampicillin (40%), ticarcillin 
(38.7%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (34.7%); however, they were highly 
susceptible to imipenem (98.6%), cefotetan (98.6%), cefepime (94.6%), and 
chloramphenicol (94.6%). Although 52 strains (69.3%) showed resistance against 
at least 1 of the 16 antibiotics tested, 23 strains (30.7%) were susceptible to 
all the antibiotics. Nine different serotypes (O166, O8, O20, O25, O119, O159, 
O28ac, O127a, and O18), five genotypes (I to V, random-amplified polymorphic 
DNA), and four phenotypes (A to D, MALDI-TOF MS) were identified, showing the 
high level of heterogeneity between the E. coli isolates recovered from 
diarrheal patients in South Korea.
