Fall prevention has an indispensable role in enhancing life expectancy and 
quality of life among older adults. The first step to prevent falls is to devise 
reliable methods to identify individuals at high fall risk. The purpose of the 
current study was to assess alterations in local postural muscle and central 
sensory balance control mechanisms due to low-frequency externally applied 
vibration among elders at high fall risk, in comparison with healthy controls, 
as a potential tool for assessing fall risk. Three groups of participants were 
recruited: healthy young (n = 10; age = 23 ± 2 years), healthy elders (n = 10; 
age = 73 ± 3 years), and elders at high fall risk (n = 10; age = 84 ± 9 years). 
Eyes-open and eyes-closed upright standing balance performance was measured with 
no vibration, 30 Hz, and 40 Hz vibration of Gastrocnemius muscles. When 
vibratory stimulation was applied, changes in local-control performance 
manifested significant differences among the groups (p < 0.01). On average 
between conditions, we observed 97% and 92% less change among high fall risk 
participants when compared to healthy young and older adults, respectively. On 
the other hand, vibration-induced changes in the central-control performance 
were not significant between groups (p ≥ 0.19). Results suggest that 
local-control deficits are responsible for balance behavior alterations among 
elders at high fall risk and healthy individuals. This observation may be 
attributable to deterioration of short-latency reflexive loop in elders at high 
fall risk. On the other hand, we could not ascribe the balance alterations to 
problems related to central nervous system performance or long-latency 
responses.

PURPOSE OF STUDY: To describe the association between increasing age and 
survival among women aged over 65 years, diagnosed with breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A historical prospective cohort study, comparing 3270 
breast cancer patients to 13,163 non cancer age matched controls. Baseline 
characteristics and cancer data gathered from the Israeli Central Bureau of 
Statistics (1995), the Israel Cancer Registry (2000-2010). Baseline measurements 
included age, socioeconomic status. Cancer stage at diagnosis was clustered as 
stage I, stage II-III and metastatic. Cox Proportional Hazards regression models 
were used to determine Hazards Ratios (HR) for mortality.
RESULTS: Between ages 65-69 and ≥85, metastatic disease rose from 3.9% to 23.4% 
and stage I disease declined from 58.6% to 30.1%. At age 80-84, 50% life 
expectancy among controls, stage I, and stage II-III disease was 95,92 and 90 
months respectively, compared to 2 months for metastatic disease. Compared to 
controls, between the age 65-69 to ≥85, adjusted HR's progressively decreased 
among subjects with stage I from HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.69-1.33) to 0.60 (95%CI 
0.36-1.01), stage II-III from HR 3.26 (95%CI2.58-4.12) to HR 1.60 (95%CI 
1.22-2.09), and metastatic disease from HR 57.40 (95%CI 39.56-83.29) to HR 20.76 
(95%CI 14.73-29.24).
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the increasingly poor prognosis and short life 
expectancy observed among women aged ≥80 diagnosed with metastatic breast. In 
contrast, our findings confirm the positive prognosis associated with rising 
age, among older women presenting with stage I breast cancer, among whom 
survival was similar, if not slightly better, than non-cancer age matched 
controls.

BACKGROUND: Venous air embolism is a potentially life-threatening complication 
of IV catheter use in horses. Despite widespread anecdotal reports of their 
occurrence, few cases have been reported in the literature and the prognosis is 
currently unknown.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to describe the surrounding 
circumstances, clinical signs, treatment, progression, and outcome of venous air 
embolism in hospitalized horses.
ANIMALS: Thirty-two horses with acute onset of compatible clinical signs 
associated with IV catheter disconnection or damage.
METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study. Data extracted from clinical records 
included signalment, presenting complaint, catheter details, clinical signs, 
treatments, and outcome.
RESULTS: Most cases resulted from extension set disconnection occurring within 
approximately 24 hours after catheter placement. In fewer horses, extension set 
damage was cited as a cause. Common clinical signs included tachycardia, 
tachypnea, recumbency, muscle fasciculations and agitation, with abnormal 
behavior including kicking and flank biting. Less commonly, pathological 
arrhythmias or more severe neurologic signs, including blindness and seizures, 
were noted. Progression was unpredictable, with some affected horses developing 
delayed-onset neurologic signs. Mortality was 6/32 (19%), including 2 cases of 
sudden death and other horses euthanized because of persistent neurologic 
deficits. Negative outcomes were more common in horses with recorded blindness, 
sweating or recumbency, but blindness resolved in 5/8 affected horses.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The prognosis for resolution of clinical 
signs after air embolism is fair, but permanent neurologic deficits or 
pathologic cardiac arrhythmias can arise. Unpredictable progression warrants 
close monitoring. Systematic clinic-based surveillance could provide additional 
useful information to aid prevention.

Background: In our modern world, the way of life in nutritional and activity 
behaviour has changed. As a consequence, parallel trends of an epidemic of 
overweight and a decline in external skeletal robusticity are observed in 
children and adolescents. Aim: We aim to develop reference centiles for external 
skeletal robusticity of European girls and boys aged 0 to 18 years using the 
Frame Index as an indicator and identify population specific age-related 
patterns. Methods: We analysed cross-sectional & longitudinal data on body 
height and elbow breadth of boys and girls from Europe (0-18 years, n = 41.679), 
India (7-18 years, n = 3.297) and South Africa (3-18 years, n = 4.346). As an 
indicator of external skeletal robusticity Frame Index after Frisancho (1990) 
was used. We developed centiles for boys and girls using the LMS-method and its 
extension. Results: Boys have greater external skeletal robusticity than girls. 
Whereas in girls Frame Index decreases continuously during growth, an increase 
of Frame Index from 12 to 16 years in European boys can be observed. Indian and 
South African boys are almost similar in Frame Index to European boys. In girls, 
the pattern is slightly different. Whereas South African girls are similar to 
European girls, Indian girls show a lesser external skeletal robusticity. 
Conclusion: Accurate references for external skeletal robusticity are needed to 
evaluate if skeletal development is adequate per age. They should be used to 
monitor effects of changes in way of life and physical activity levels in 
children and adolescents to avoid negative health outcomes like osteoporosis and 
arthrosis.

Human-environment interactions are mediated through the body and occur within 
the peripersonal space (PPS), the space immediately adjacent to and surrounding 
the body. The PPS is taken to be a critical interface between the body and the 
environment, and indeed, body-part specific PPS remapping has been shown to 
depend on body-part utilization, such as upper limb movements in otherwise 
static observers. How vestibular signals induced by whole-body movement 
contribute to PPS representation is less well understood. In a series of 
experiments, we mapped the spatial extension of the PPS around the head while 
participants were submitted to passive whole-body rotations inducing vestibular 
stimulation. Forty-six participants, in three experiments, executed a tactile 
detection reaction time task while task-irrelevant auditory stimuli approached 
them. The maximal distance at which the auditory stimulus facilitated tactile 
reaction time was taken as a proxy for the boundary of peri-head space. The 
present results indicate two distinct vestibular effects. First, vestibular 
stimulation speeded tactile detection indicating a vestibular facilitation of 
somatosensory processing. Second, vestibular stimulation modulated audio-tactile 
interaction of peri-head space in a rotation direction-specific manner. 
Congruent but not incongruent audio-vestibular motion stimuli expanded the PPS 
boundary further away from the body as compared to no rotation. These results 
show that vestibular inputs dynamically update the multisensory delineation of 
PPS and far space, which may serve to maintain accurate tracking of objects 
close to the body and to update spatial self-representations.

Scorpions maintenance in captivity for venom extraction purposes in Costa Rica.

Brenes E, Gómez A.

Approximately 2 000 scorpion species can be found around the world; although few 
species are considered “harmful” to human beings, a high number of scorpionism 
cases are reported all over the world. The elaboration of anti-scorpion sera 
requires the establishment of an animal collection maintained in captivity for 
venom extraction purposes. The Clodomiro Picado Institute (ICP, for its acronym 
in Spanish), poses a vast trajectory in manufacturing snakebite antivenoms, and 
starts a scorpion collection in 2005 for this purpose. In total, 2 043 scorpions 
were classified in 11 species and collected during a seven-year period using a 
black-light flashlight and an intensive seeking methodology. The scorpions were 
collected from several localities of the Pacific and the Caribbean versants of 
Costa Rica. The venom extraction was performed by applying electrostimulation; 
the collected venom was characterized by total protein content in addition to 
median lethal doses. Centruroides bicolor showed higher amounts of venom yield, 
total protein content and more lethal dose, all of which were correlated with 
its body mass. The techniques used to keep scorpions in captivity allowed the 
animals to live several years. Longevity analysis showed significant differences 
among scorpion genera (H= 353.80; df= 3; P < 0.0001); moreover, the genus 
Didymocentrus lived longer with an average of 4.46 years. One key factor of its 
longevity was that it did not go through venom extraction processes. 
Additionally, a high survival rate of Tityus pachyurus born in captivity, 
compared to other species within the same genus, was observed (H= 94.32; df= 3; 
P < 0.0001). This characteristic should be taken into consideration, when 
programs of reproduction in captivity are designed. In conclusion, the 
maintenance of a scorpion collection was efficient for venom extraction purposes 
and a longer life expectancy of the animals. Moreover, there is a scarcity on 
publications regarding scorpion maintenance in captivity for venom extraction 
purposes; therefore, a deeper research in aspects such as reproduction, death 
causes and feeding behaviors is required.

OBJECTIVES: Collaborative care is an effective approach for treating 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression within the US Military 
Health System (MHS), but its cost-effectiveness remains unstudied. Our objective 
was to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of centrally assisted 
collaborative telecare (CACT) versus optimized usual care (OUC) for PTSD and 
depression in the MHS.
STUDY DESIGN: A randomized trial compared CACT with OUC. Routine primary care 
screening identified active-duty service members with PTSD or depression. 
Eligible participants (N = 666) were randomized to CACT or OUC and assessed at 
3, 6, and 12 months. OUC patients could receive care management and increased 
behavioral health support. CACT patients could receive these services plus 
stepped psychosocial treatment and routine centralized team monitoring.
METHODS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived from the 12-Item Short 
Form Health Survey. Claims and case management data were used to estimate costs. 
Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Data from 629 patients (320 CACT and 309 OUC) with sufficient follow-up 
were analyzed. CACT patients gained 0.02 QALYs (95% CI, -0.001 to 0.03) relative 
to OUC patients. Twelve-month costs, including productivity, were $987 (95% CI, 
-$3056 to $5030) higher for CACT versus OUC. CACT was estimated to cost $49,346 
per QALY gained compared with OUC over 12 months. There is a 58% probability 
that CACT is cost-effective at a $100,000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its higher costs, CACT appears to be a cost-effective 
strategy relative to OUC for managing PTSD and depression in the MHS.

Advancing age is the biggest risk factor for development for the major 
life-threatening diseases in industrialized nations accounting for >90% of 
deaths. Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is among the most devastating. Currently 
approved therapies fail to slow progression of the disease, providing only 
modest improvements in memory. Recently reported work describes mechanistic 
studies of J147, a promising therapeutic molecule previously shown to rescue the 
severe cognitive deficits exhibited by aged, transgenic AD mice. Apparently, 
J147 targets the mitochondrial alpha-F1-ATP synthase (ATP5A). Modest inhibition 
of the ATP synthase modulates intracellular calcium to activate AMP-activated 
protein kinase to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin, a known mechanism of 
lifespan extension from worms to mammals.

BACKGROUND: Kidney autotransplantation (KAT) is the ultimate approach for 
nephron-sparing surgery. It is a rarely used method in renal tumor surgery today 
as minimal invasive and open techniques for nephron-sparing surgery improve 
constantly. In this publication, the complication rate and the long-term 
functional and oncological outcome at a single center are analyzed.
METHODS: A prospectively constructed database of patients with renal tumors who 
underwent renal surgery was retrospectively analyzed to identify patients with 
KAT and describe surgical and oncological outcomes and to obtain long-term 
follow-up. Data collection included detailed surgical technique, complications 
(Clavian-Dindo), and hospital stay, as well as functional and oncological 
outcome and long-term follow-up.
RESULTS: Between 1976 and 2013, 12 patients (median age 50.5 years) underwent 
KAT for highly complex renal masses: in five cases for complex renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC), five cases for complex upper urinary tract carcinoma (UTUC), 
one case for a renal metastasis, and one case for nephroblastoma. The 
nephrectomy or nephron-ureterectomy was performed open via a flank or 
transabdominal. The median surgical time was 360 min (range 270-490 min). 
Intraoperatively, six cases required blood transfusions (50%). Six patients 
(50%) developed significant postoperative complications (Clavian-Dindo > 2). In 
two patients, intermittent hemodialysis for delayed graft function (16.6%) was 
needed, and in six cases (50%), additional blood transfusions postoperatively 
were necessary. At discharge from hospital, all patients had functioning grafts. 
The median hospital stay was 29.5 days (range 18-35). At follow-up (median 
follow-up of 83.5 ± 40.7 months), six patients had died (50%)-all with 
functioning grafts (free from hemodialysis). In five cases, recurrence of 
primary tumor or metastatic disease was recorded. In four cases, the recurrent 
carcinoma could be resected; in detail, UTUC in three cases and one partial 
nephrectomy of the autotransplanted kidney was performed. One patient suffered 
from bone and lung metastasis. Two patients died finally tumor-related. Five 
patients (41.6%) are presently alive, without evidence of tumor relapse. One 
patient developed terminal renal failure requiring hemodialysis 105 months after 
autotransplantation. One additional patient was lost to follow-up; after 
69 months, this patient had a functioning kidney and no evidence of 
disease-recurrence at the last follow-up. A cumulative number of 1424 months 
without hemodialysis was gained for these 12 patients. In the literature to 
date, most KAT are performed in benign disease, with minor but frequent 
complication. Here, we report the largest series of KAT for malignant kidney 
tumors. The complication rates are similar, compared to the recently reported 
series for benign indications with an improved graft survival rate. Since KAT 
requires a complex and challenging surgical approach, it should be performed by 
experienced kidney transplant surgeons.
CONCLUSION: In very complex cases involving renal tumors and multi-morbidity, 
patients should be counseled well before KAT is considered. At the same time, 
KAT should not be abandoned in these very rare cases, especially when a 
nephron-sparing approach is otherwise not feasible. KAT can maintain renal 
function and quality of life and extend expectancy of life.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: clinical aspects and preventive and therapeutic 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the result of a complex process 
in which several prenatal and/or postnatal factors interfere with lower 
respiratory tract development, leading to a severe, lifelong disease. In this 
review, what is presently known regarding BPD pathogenesis, its impact on 
long-term pulmonary morbidity and mortality and the available preventive and 
therapeutic strategies are discussed.
MAIN BODY: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with persistent lung 
impairment later in life, significantly impacting health services because 
subjects with BPD have, in most cases, frequent respiratory diseases and 
reductions in quality of life and life expectancy. Prematurity per se is 
associated with an increased risk of long-term lung problems. However, in 
children with BPD, impairment of pulmonary structures and function is even 
greater, although the characterization of long-term outcomes of BPD is difficult 
because the adults presently available to study have received outdated 
treatment. Prenatal and postnatal preventive measures are extremely important to 
reduce the risk of BPD.
CONCLUSION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a respiratory condition that presently 
occurs in preterm neonates and can lead to chronic respiratory problems. 
Although knowledge about BPD pathogenesis has significantly increased in recent 
years, not all of the mechanisms that lead to lung damage are completely 
understood, which explains why therapeutic approaches that are theoretically 
effective have been only partly satisfactory or useless and, in some cases, 
potentially negative. However, prevention of prematurity, systematic use of 
nonaggressive ventilator measures, avoiding supraphysiologic oxygen exposure and 
administration of surfactant, caffeine and vitamin A can significantly reduce 
the risk of BPD development. Cell therapy is the most fascinating new measure to 
address the lung damage due to BPD. It is desirable that ongoing studies yield 
positive results to definitively solve a major clinical, social and economic 
problem.

Type 2 diabetes has an increasing prevalence. Life expectancy is dominated by 
cardiovascular risk, which is the leading cause of death in these patients. Up 
to one third of diabetic patients will develop diabetic nephropathy related to 
micro-angiopathy. Renal impairment further increases cardiovascular risk. 
Reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is a major public health issue, 
as well as early preventing and managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Good 
glycemic control prevents the micro-vascular complications of the disease 
(retinopathy, nephropathy, etc.) and, more recently recognized through prolonged 
monitoring of the VADT cohort, prevents cardiovascular complications. Control of 
blood pressure and dyslipidemia are essential in primary or secondary 
cardiovascular prevention. In addition, the blockers of the renin-angiotensin 
system slow down the progression of the MRC. Elderly patients with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) form another growing group of the nephrologist daily 
patient pool. Especially for very elderly patients with comorbidities, the 
question of favoring conservative treatment rather than starting or pursuing 
dialysis may arise. Survival and quality of life are indeed not necessarily 
better in elderly patients undergoing dialysis, complications can occur 
eventually leading to discontinuation, and are occasionally associated with a 
feeling of stubbornness. Creation of prognostic score is a useful tool to help 
the decision-making process. However, dialogue with the patient and his/her 
family, as well as multidisciplinary collaboration remain fundamentals to 
determine the most suitable care.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative neoplasm defined by the 
t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation, primarily affects older adults. 
Historically, effective treatment options were not available for older CML 
patients ineligible for curative allogeneic stem cell transplant, and the 
disease was therefore usually fatal within several years of diagnosis. The 
development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that effectively target the 
constitutively active mutant tyrosine kinase in CML has dramatically improved 
outcomes for all patients with CML, including older patients. While older 
patients were underrepresented in prospective trials, TKI therapy can be 
successfully administered to older adults with CML with excellent efficacy and 
proven tolerability. TKI selection and monitoring for adverse events should be 
tailored based on co-morbidities. As with younger patients, life expectancy of 
older adults with CML now approaches that of age-matched controls. Here we 
review guidelines for management of older adults with CML.

Why is life expectancy in England and Wales 'stalling'?

Several independent analyses, by both epidemiologists and actuaries, have 
concluded that the previous rate of improvement of life expectancy in England 
and Wales has now slowed markedly, and at older ages may even be reversing. 
However, although these findings have led the pension industry to reduce 
estimates of future liabilities, they have failed to elicit any significant 
concern in the Department of Health and Social Care. In this essay, we review 
the evidence on changing life expectancy, noting that the problems are greatest 
among older women. We then estimate the gap between what life expectancy is now 
and what it might have been had previous trends continued. At age 85, the gap is 
0.34 years for women and 0.23 for men. We argue that recent changes cannot be 
dismissed as a temporary aberration. While the causes of this phenomenon are 
contested, there is growing evidence to point to the austerity policies 
implemented in recent years as at least a partial explanation. We conclude by 
calling for a fully independent enquiry to ascertain what is happening to life 
expectancy in England and Wales and what should be done about it.

Urological Management of Extramural Malignant Ureteric Obstruction: A Survey of 
Irish Urologists.

INTRODUCTION: The absence of guidelines in the management of extramural 
malignant ureteric obstruction leads to confusion in decision making and in the 
interaction between urology and other clinical disciplines. In this study, we 
surveyed consultant urologists with the goal of achieving a better consensus on 
optimal management options.
METHODS: A multiple choice survey was sent via the online survey tool 
"SurveyMonkey" to all consultant urologists practicing in the Republic of 
Ireland.
RESULTS: There was a response rate of 57.5% (n = 23). Twenty-two (96%) 
consultants consider the use of percutaneous nephrostomy with placement of 
antegrade ureteric stent but only 22% (n = 5) would consider using a metallic 
stent. Eleven (48%) respondents favor retrograde stenting in the first instance 
with an equal proportion choosing an antegrade method. Nine (39%) consultants 
perform the initial stent change at 4-6 months, 8 (35%) at 2-4 months, and 1 at 
< 2 months and 6-10 months respectively. Total 59% (n = 13) of respondents felt 
that the duration of expected patient survival influenced their decision and 
agreement to stent with 42% (n = 8) saying this survival would need to be > 6 
months and 82% (n = 18) were generally happy with the level of ongoing 
communication between urology and the primary service managing the patient.
CONCLUSION: There is a lack of consensus regarding the management of this 
challenging problem, particularly with regard to timing of first stent change 
and whether to initially use an antegrade or retrograde approach. This reflects 
the heterogeneous patient cohort and the important factors of life expectancy 
and patient co-morbidities.

We investigated changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) due to hip 
fracture in Mexican adults aged ≥ 50 years during the first year post-fracture. 
Mean accumulated loss was 0.27 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). HRQoL before 
fracture was the main contributor to explain the loss of QALYs.
INTRODUCTION: We aimed to estimate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
loss over 1 year in patients sustaining a hip fracture in Mexico.
METHODS: Individuals aged ≥ 50 years old with diagnosis of a low-energy-induced 
hip fracture enrolled in the International Costs and Utilities Related to 
Osteoporotic Fractures Study (ICUROS) composed the study population. After a 
recall of their own pre-fracture status, HRQoL was prospectively collected in 
three phases over 12 months of follow-up using EQ-5D-3L. The UK preference 
weight set was applied to calculate the utility values. The accumulated 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) loss in the first year post-fracture was 
estimated using the trapezoid method. Multivariate regression analysis allowed 
identifying determinants of QALYs loss.
RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three patients (mean ± SD age 77.2 ± 9.9 years; 80% 
women; 15.5% with prior fracture in the last 5 years; 78% in low-income 
category) were evaluated. Mean (95% CI) utility value before fracture was 0.64 
(0.59-0.68). It dropped to 0.01 (0.01-0.02) immediately after fracture and then 
improved to 0.46 (0.42-0.51) and 0.60 (0.55-0.64) at 4 and 12 months 
post-fracture, respectively. Disregarding fracture-related mortality, 
accumulated QALYs loss over the first year was 0.27 (0.24-0.30) QALYs. Mobility, 
self-care, and usual activities were the most affected domains throughout the 
whole year. HRQoL before fracture was the main contributor to explain the loss 
of QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Hip fractures reduce dramatically the HRQoL, with the loss 
sustained at least over the first year post-fracture in Mexico. The utility 
values derived from this study can be used in future economic evaluations.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic systemic disease characterized by 
microvasculopathy, autoantibodies, and extensive fibrosis. Intestinal 
involvement is frequent in SSc and represents a significant cause of morbidity. 
The pathogenesis of intestinal involvement includes vascular damage, nerve 
dysfunction, smooth muscle atrophy, and fibrosis, causing hypomotility, which 
leads to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), malabsorption, 
malnutrition, diarrhea, pseudo-obstruction, constipation, pneumatosis 
intestinalis, and fecal incontinence. Manifestations are often troublesome and 
reduce quality of life and life expectancy. Assessment of intestinal involvement 
includes screening for small intestine hypomotility, malnutrition, SIBO, and 
anorectal dysfunction. Current management of intestinal manifestations is 
largely inadequate. Patients with diarrhea are managed with low-fat diet, 
medium-chain triglycerides, avoidance of lactulose and fructose, and control of 
bacterial overgrowth with antibiotics for SIBO. In diarrhea/malabsorption, bile 
acid sequestrant and pancreatic enzyme supplementation may help, and nutritional 
support is needed. General measures are applied for constipation, and intestine 
rest plus antibiotics for pseudo-obstruction. Fecal incontinence is managed with 
measures for associated SIBO, or constipation, and with behavioral therapies. 
Pneumatosis intestinalis is usually an incidental finding that does not require 
any specific treatment. Immunomoduation should be considered early in intestinal 
involvement. Multidisciplinary approach of intestinal manifestations in SSc by 
gastroenterologists and rheumatologists is required for optimum management.

Comment in
    Obesity (Silver Spring). 2018 Mar;26(3):461-462.

OBJECTIVE: Assortative mating for adiposity increases the genetic burden on 
offspring, but its causes remain unclear. One hypothesis is that people who have 
high adiposity find other people with obesity more physically attractive than 
lean people.
METHODS: The attractiveness of sets of images of males and females who varied in 
adiposity were rated by opposite sex subjects (559 males and 340 females) across 
12 countries.
RESULTS: There was tremendous individual variability in attractiveness ratings. 
For female attractiveness, most males favored the leanest subjects, but others 
favored intermediate fatness, some were indifferent to body composition, and 
others rated the subjects with obesity as most attractive. For male images rated 
by females, the patterns were more complex. Most females favored subjects with 
low levels of adiposity (but not the lowest level), whereas others were 
indifferent to body fatness or rated the images depicting individuals with 
obesity as the most attractive. These patterns were unrelated to rater BMI. 
Among Caucasian males who rated the images of the thinnest females as being more 
attractive, the magnitude of the effect depended on rater BMI, indicating 
limited "mutual attraction."
CONCLUSIONS: Individual variations in ratings of physical attractiveness were 
broadly unrelated to rater BMI and suggest that mutual attraction is an unlikely 
explanation for assortative mating for obesity.

As the prognoses of both heart and cancer patients have improved along with a 
longer life expectancy in the general population, the prevalence of both heart- 
and cancer diseases is increasing. Thus, a larger proportion of cancer patients 
will have cardiovascular co-morbidity and an increased risk of cardiovascular 
complications during and after cancer treatment. In this article, the current 
knowledge on the prevention, monitoring and treatment of cardiotoxicity induced 
by medical anti-cancer treatment with focus on anthracyclines, trastuzumab and 
5-fluorouracil is described.

What Is the Impact of Targeted Health Education for Mental Health Nurses in the 
Provision of Physical Health Care? An Integrated Literature Review.

Author information:

Sciences , Dublin , Ireland.

Individuals with a severe mental illness have a gap in life expectancy of up to 
20 years in comparison to the general population. Nurses who work in mental 
health services have been identified as best placed to improve the physical 
health outcomes of individuals with mental illness. The literature identifies a 
lack of nursing knowledge related to physical health care and the presence of 
metabolic syndrome which is impeding nurses in providing essential physical 
health care to patients. An integrated literature review was carried out due to 
the dearth of research evidence pertaining to the impact of targeted education 
specifically with psychiatric/mental health nurses in the provision of physical 
healthcare. A search for literature included the following databases: CINAHL, 
Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science revealed nine studies: seven 
quantitative, one qualitative and one mixed method. Qualitative synthesis has 
shed light on the value of targeted education on improving knowledge and skills 
in providing physical health care that can then be translated into clinical 
practice. Targeted education in physical healthcare grows psychiatric/mental 
health nurse's confidence and develops the skills necessary to enable them to 
screen and monitor and offer range of physical health interventions to 
individuals with severe mental illness. Accessible summary • The poor physical 
health outcomes and premature death of individuals with severe mental illness is 
of growing concern; a contributing factor is a lack of knowledge and confidence 
amongst psychiatric/mental health nurses to providing physical health screening 
and intervening in preventable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke 
cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. • An integrated literature review was used 
to ascertain if targeted education on physical health care can improve the 
knowledge base of psychiatric/mental health nurses within physical health care. 
• Nine studies were critically appraised, and the data reduced using a narrative 
synthesis that tells a story of the findings from these research studies. • The 
review found that targeted education with psychiatric/mental health nurses does 
result in a statistical increase in knowledge This review finds that nurses have 
not been regularly supported with physical health education to alter existing 
practices. This lack of knowledge within physical healthcare is hindering 
psychiatric/mental health nurses to fully engaging in physical health care 
activities in practice.

Scaling Up Human Immunodeficiency Virus Screening and Antiretroviral Therapy 
Among Men Who Have Sex With Men to Achieve the 90-90-90 Targets in China.

Zhuang X, Peng P, Sun H, Chu M, Jiang S, Jiang L, Zhou P, Zhu B, Zhang L.

INTRODUCTION: The Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome has proposed the 90-90-90 targets by 
2020. Human immunodeficiency virus epidemic is spreading rapidly among men who 
have sex with men (MSM) in China. This study investigates how the scale-up of 
HIV testing and treatment in achieving the targets and its cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We constructed a compartmental model to forecast the HIV epidemic in 
Chinese MSM based on various "test-and-treat" scale-up scenarios. We assessed 
their cost effectiveness based on the cost for each HIV infection, death, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented by the scale-up.
RESULTS: If the current epidemic continued, HIV prevalence among Chinese MSM 
would increase from 9.2% in 2016 to 12.6% (9.2-15.6%) in 2020 and 16.2% 
(11.3-20.0%) in 2025. By 2020, 49.2% of infected MSM would be diagnosed and 
40.1% of whom on treatment, falling short of the 90-90-90 targets, so would be 
even by 2025. To achieve these targets by 2020, additional 850,000 HIV screening 
tests and 112,500 person-years of antiretroviral treatment (ART) annually are 
necessary. This spending is US $478 million during 2016 to 2020, which almost 
tripled the status quo. However, by delaying to 2025, an investment of US $1210 
million over 2016 to 2025 corresponding to 52% increase to the status quo, will 
enable extra 340,000 HIV screening tests and 60,000 person-year on ART annually. 
In both scenarios, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US $733 to 960 
for each DALY prevented, indicating highly cost-effective scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving the 90-90-90 targets by 2020 requires steep increase in 
investment, but delaying the targets to 2025 is practical and cost-effective.

Care.

Use of highly concentrated ethyl esters of polyunsaturated fatty acids after 
myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with heart failure was associated 
with lower mortality. The goal of this analysis was to perform cost-utility 
analysis of the use of highly concentrated ethyl esters of polyunsaturated fatty 
acids after MI (with help of a Markov model) and to find whether its use in some 
group of patients led to decrease in budget costs. As a result, we have shown 
that use of highly concentrated ethyl esters of polyunsaturated fatty acids 
after MI leads to increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy on 0.5 QALY, with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 105 thousand rubles per QALY, and net 
monetary benefit of 780.5 thousand rubles. In the patient subpopulation that 
receives highly concentrated ethyl esters of polyunsaturated fatty acids for 
arrhythmia prevention after coronary artery bypass the estimated decrease of 
budget cost varies between 6 and 50% depending on denominator used.

The current study is the first study to emphasize family systems, violent norms, 
and violent peer association as three domains of the social environment that 
influence both adolescent violent offending and victimization among Chinese 
adolescents using a longitudinal sample. Under the framework of cultural 
spillover theory, the purpose of the current study was to explore how these 
three factors influenced adolescent violent offending and victimization. A total 
of 1192 middle and high school students were randomly selected from one of the 
largest cities in Southwest China. Structural equation model analysis was 
applied to investigate the direct and indirect effect of violence in the family 
system on violent offending and victimization. The results indicated that 
violent offending and victimization overlapped among Chinese adolescents. 
Violent peer association and acceptance of the violence norm fully mediated the 
effect of violence in the family system on violent offending, and partially 
mediated the effect of violence in the family system on violent victimization. 
In conclusion, adolescents who had experienced violence in their family system 
were more likely to be exposed to violent peer influences and to accept violent 
norms, which increased the likelihood of violence perpetration and victimization
