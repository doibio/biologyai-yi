Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited autosomal-dominant connective tissue 
disorder with multiorgan involvement including musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
cardiovascular, ocular, and skin manifestations. Life expectancy in patients 
with MFS is primarily determined by the degree of cardiovascular involvement. 
Aortic disease is the major cardiovascular manifestation of MFS. However, 
non-aortic cardiac diseases, such as impaired myocardial function and 
arrhythmia, have been increasingly acknowledged as additional causes of 
morbidity and mortality. We present two cases demonstrating the phenotypical 
variation in patients with MFS and how CMR (Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance) 
could serve as a "one stop shop" to retrieveS all the necessary information 
regarding aortic/vascular pathology as well as any potential underlying 
arrhythmogenic substrate or cardiomyopathic process.

An increase in life expectancy leads to a greater impact of chronic 
non-communicable diseases. This is even more remarkable in elder populations, to 
whom these become main determinants of health status, affecting mental and 
physical health, quality of life, and autonomy. Disease appearance is closely 
related to the levels of cellular oxidation, pointing out the importance of 
including foods in one's diet that can prevent oxidative stress. Previous 
studies and clinical data suggest that some plant-based products can slow and 
reduce the cellular degradation associated with aging and age-related diseases. 
Many plants from one family present several applications that range from the 
food to the pharmaceutical industry due to their characteristic flavor and 
scents. The Zingiberaceae family, which includes cardamom, turmeric, and ginger, 
has bioactive compounds with antioxidant activities. They also have 
anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiemetic activities and 
properties that help prevent cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. 
These products are abundant sources of chemical substances, such as alkaloids, 
carbohydrates, proteins, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and diarylheptanoids. The 
main bioactive compounds found in this family (cardamom, turmeric, and ginger) 
are 1,8-cineole, α-terpinyl acetate, β-turmerone, and α-zingiberene. The present 
review gathers evidence surrounding the effects of dietary intake of extracts of 
the Zingiberaceae family and their underlying mechanisms of action. These 
extracts could be an adjuvant treatment for oxidative-stress-related 
pathologies. However, the bioavailability of these compounds needs to be 
optimized, and further research is needed to determine appropriate 
concentrations and their antioxidant effects in the body.

The therapeutic approach to chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) has changed in 
recent years. As a result, a high percentage of current patients in the chronic 
phase of the disease almost have an average life expectancy. Treatment also aims 
to achieve a stable deep molecular response (DMR) that might allow dose 
reduction or even treatment discontinuation. These strategies are often used in 
authentic practices to reduce adverse events, yet their impact on treatment-free 
remission (TFR) is a controversial debate. In some studies, it has been observed 
that as many as half of patients can achieve TFR after the discontinuation of 
TKI treatment. If TFR was more widespread and globally achievable, the 
perspective on toxicity could be changed. We retrospectively analysed 80 CML 
patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) at a tertiary hospital 
between 2002 and 2022. From them, 71 patients were treated with low doses of 
TKI, and 25 were eventually discontinued, 9 of them being discontinued without a 
previous dose reduction. Regarding patients treated with low doses, only 11 of 
them had molecular recurrence (15.4%), and the average molecular recurrence free 
survival (MRFS) was 24.6 months. The MRFS outcome was not affected by any of the 
variables examined, including gender, Sokal risk scores, prior treatment with 
interferon or hydroxycarbamide, age at the time of CML diagnosis, the initiation 
of low-dose therapy and the mean duration of TKI therapy. After TKI 
discontinuation, all but four patients maintained MMR, with a median follow-up 
of 29.2 months. In our study, TFR was estimated at 38.9 months (95% CI 
4.1-73.9). This study indicates that low-dose treatment and/or TKI 
discontinuation is a salient, safe alternative to be considered for patients who 
may suffer adverse events (AEs), which hinder the adherence of TKI and/or 
deteriorate their life quality. Together with the published literature, it shows 
that it appears safe to administer reduced doses to patients with CML in the 
chronic phase. The discontinuation of TKI therapy once a DMR has been reached is 
one of the goals for these patients. The patient should be assessed globally, 
and the most appropriate strategy for management should be considered. Future 
studies are needed to ensure that this approach is included in clinical practice 
because of the benefits for certain patients and the increased efficiency for 
the healthcare system.

Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of rare metabolic diseases associated 
with reduced life expectancy and a substantial unmet medical need. 
Immunomodulatory drugs could be a relevant treatment approach for MPS patients, 
although they are not licensed for this population. Therefore, we aim to provide 
evidence justifying fast access to innovative individual treatment trials (ITTs) 
with immunomodulators and a high-quality evaluation of drug effects by 
implementing a risk-benefit model for MPS. The iterative methodology of our 
developed decision analysis framework (DAF) consists of the following steps: (i) 
a comprehensive literature analysis on promising treatment targets and 
immunomodulators for MPS; (ii) a quantitative risk-benefit assessment (RBA) of 
selected molecules; and (iii) allocation phenotypic profiles and a quantitative 
assessment. These steps allow for the personalized use of the model and are in 
accordance with expert and patient representatives. The following four promising 
immunomodulators were identified: adalimumab, abatacept, anakinra, and 
cladribine. An improvement in mobility is most likely with adalimumab, while 
anakinra might be the treatment of choice for patients with neurocognitive 
involvement. Nevertheless, a RBA should always be completed on an individual 
basis. Our evidence-based DAF model for ITTs directly addresses the substantial 
unmet medical need in MPS and characterizes a first approach toward precision 
medicine with immunomodulatory drugs.

High pressure processing (HPP) offers the benefits of safety, uniformity, 
energy-efficient, and low waste, which is widely applied for microbial 
inactivation and shelf-life extension for foods. Over the past forty years, HPP 
has been extensively researched in the food industry, enabling the inactivation 
or activation of different enzymes in future food by altering their molecular 
structure and active site conformation. Such activation or inactivation of 
enzymes effectively hinders the spoilage of food and the production of 
beneficial substances, which is crucial for improving food quality. This paper 
reviews the mechanism in which high pressure affects the stability and activity 
of enzymes, concludes the roles of key enzymes in the future food processed 
using high pressure technologies. Moreover, we discuss the application of 
modified enzymes based on high pressure, providing insights into the future 
direction of enzyme evolution under complex food processing conditions (e.g. 
high temperature, high pressure, high shear, and multiple elements). Finally, we 
conclude with prospects of high pressure technology and research directions in 
the future. Although HPP has shown positive effects in improving the future food 
quality, there is still a pressing need to develop new and effective combined 
processing methods, upgrade processing modes, and promote sustainable 
lifestyles.

In this study, the commercial bacteria Danisco and Bifidobacterium lactis were 
used to ferment soy yogurt, and then the quality of yogurt and the number of 
active probiotics in yogurt during storage were investigated. The results showed 
that the total number of viable bacteria in soy yogurt increased first and then 
decreased, but all of them met the standard for the number of viable bacteria in 
probiotic foods. The content of protein, lipid, and total sugar in soy yogurt 
decreased gradually with the extension of storage time. The texture, water 
holding capacity, and rheological properties of soy yogurt were improved within 
0-10 days, and there was no significant change after 15 days. However, 
brightness and whiteness of yogurt were significantly reduced. Based on 
realizing the reuse of soy whey, this study provided a theoretical basis for the 
research of the shelf life of soy yogurt. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study 
developed a soy yogurt with good quality and provided a theoretical basis for 
the study of the shelf life of soy yogurt. In addition, some technical support 
was provided for the reuse of soy whey.

AIM: To identify the experiences of shared decision-making (SDM) for adults with 
end-stage kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis (HD) and their family members.
DESIGN: A scoping literature review.
METHOD: A scoping literature review, using Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines.
DATA SOURCES: Medline (OVID), EMBASE, CINAHL, Psych Info, ProQuest, Web of 
Science, Open grey and grey literature were searched covering years from January 
2015 to July 2022. Empirical studies, unpublished thesis and studies in English 
were included. The scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Meta analysis-scoping review extension (PRISMA-Scr).
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the final review. While SDM is 
welcomed by people undergoing HD, their experience is often limited to treatment 
decisions, with little opportunity to revisit decisions previously made. The 
role of the family/caregivers as active participants in SDM requires 
recognition.
CONCLUSION: People with end-stage kidney disease undergoing HD do and want to 
participate in the process of SDM, on a wide range of topics, in addition to 
treatment. A strategy is needed to ensure that SDM interventions are successful 
in achieving patient-driven outcomes and enhancing their quality of life.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review highlights the experiences of 
people undergoing HD and their family/caregivers. There is a wide variety of 
clinical decisions requiring consideration for people undergoing HD, including 
considering the importance who should be involved in the decision-making 
processes and when decisions should occur. Further study to ensure nurses 
understand the importance, and influence of including family members in 
conversations on both SDM processes and outcomes is needed. There is a need for 
research from both patient and healthcare professional (HCP) perspectives to 
ensure that people feel supported and have their needs met in the SDM process.
PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.

OBJECTIVES: Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, was approved by the 
United States (US) Food and Drug administration as a first-line systemic therapy 
for locally advanced/metastatic gastric cancer patients. The current study aimed 
to investigate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab-chemotherapy combination 
versus chemotherapy alone as a first-line therapy from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted using a partitioned survival model 
in Microsoft Excel® using data from the CheckMate 649 trial. Three discrete 
mutually exclusive health states (progression-free, post-progression, and death) 
were included in the model. The health state occupancy was calculated using the 
overall survival and progression-free survival curves derived from the CheckMate 
649 trial. Cost, resource use, and health utility estimates were estimated from 
a US payer perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
assessed the uncertainty of the model parameters.
RESULTS: Nivolumab-chemotherapy provided additional 0.25 life years compared to 
chemotherapy alone and the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 0.701 and 
0.561, respectively, producing a gain of 0.140 QALYs and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $574,072/QALY.
CONCLUSION: From the US payer perspective, at a willingness to pay threshold of 
$US150,000/QALY, nivolumab-chemotherapy was not found to be cost-effective as a 
first-line therapy for locally advanced/metastatic gastric cancer.

Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a volatile plant secondary metabolite that exhibits 
strong anti-pathogenic activities. Nonetheless, less is known about the effect 
of CA on plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. In this study, we delineated the 
effects of CA fumigation on rice roots (Oryza Sativa L cv. TNG67) under salinity 
stress (200 mM NaCl). Our result showed that CA vapor significantly alleviated 
salinity-induced ROS accumulation and cell death. This CA-induced alleviation 
appears to be mediated primarily by the upregulation of proline metabolism 
genes, the rapid proline accumulation, and the decrease of Na+ /K+ ratio as 
early as 3 h after NaCl treatment. Of note, the activities of peroxidase (POD; 
EC 1.11.1.7) isozymes a and b were decreased by CA fumigation, and the 
activities of catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) and superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 
1.15.1.1) were not significantly affected. Our findings suggest that CA vapor 
might be useful for priming rice roots to withstand salinity stress, which is 
more prevalent due to the ongoing global climate change. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study to show modulation of macro- and 
micro-elements as well as antioxidative factors after CA fumigation of 
salinity-stressed rice roots.

RNA World Hypothesis is centred around the idea of a period in the early history 
of life's origin, wherein nonenzymatic oligomerization and replication of RNA 
resulted in functional ribozymes. Previous studies in this endeavour have 
demonstrated template-directed primer extension using chemically modified 
nucleotides and primers. Nonetheless, similar studies that used non-activated 
nucleotides led to the formation of RNA only with abasic sites. In this study, 
we report template-directed primer extension with prebiotically relevant cyclic 
nucleotides, under dehydration-rehydration (DH-RH) cycles occurring at high 
temperature (90 °C) and alkaline conditions (pH 8). 2'-3' cyclic nucleoside 
monophosphates (cNMP) resulted in primer extension, while 3'-5' cNMP failed to 
do so. Intact extension of up to two nucleotide additions was observed with both 
canonical hydroxy-terminated (OH-primer) and activated amino-terminated 
(NH2-primer) primers. We demonstrate primer extension reactions using both 
purine and pyrimidine 2'-3' cNMPs, with higher product yield observed during 
cAMP additions. Further, the presence of lipid was observed to significantly 
enhance the extended product in cCMP reactions. In all, our study provides a 
proof-of-concept for nonenzymatic primer extension of RNA, using intrinsically 
activated prebiotically relevant cyclic nucleotides as monomers.

The global obesity pandemic continues to rise, with figures from the World 
Health Organization showing that 13% of the world's adult population was obese 
in 2016. Obesity has significant implications, with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and several 
malignancies. The menopausal transition is associated with increased obesity, a 
transition from a gynecoid to an android body shape, and increased abdominal and 
visceral fat, which further worsens the associated cardiometabolic risks. 
Whether this increased obesity is a consequence of menopause, age, genetics, or 
environmental factors has long been debated. Increasing life expectancy means 
women spend a significant part of their lives in the menopause. As such, 
understanding this complex interplay of obesity and menopause is important to 
providing the right advice/management. We review the current evidence on obesity 
and menopause, focusing on the implications of increased obesity during 
menopause, the impact of menopause on obesity, and the effect of available 
treatments on associated morbidities.

OBJECTIVE: Post-stroke spasticity (PSS) is a common complication in stroke 
survivors, causing severe burden to patients living with it. The aim of this 
review was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the treatment of 
post-stroke spasticity, in adults, with abobotulinumtoxinA compared to the best 
supportive care, based on results from a systematic literature review. Given 
that abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) is always accompanied by the best supportive 
care treatment, the CEA compared aboBoNT-A plus the best supportive care with 
the best supportive care alone.
METHODS: A systematic literature review in EMBASE (including Medline and 
PubMed), Scopus, and other sources (Google Scholar) was conducted. Articles of 
all types, providing information on the costs and/or effectiveness measures for 
the current treatments of PSS in adults were included. The synthesis of 
information from the review provided the parameters for the design of a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of the mentioned treatment of interest. The societal 
perspective was compared to a perspective where only direct costs were observed.
RESULTS: In total, 532 abstracts were screened. Full information was revised 
from 40 papers and 13 of these were selected as core papers for full data 
extraction. Data from the core publications formed the basis for the development 
of a cost-effectiveness model. In all the included papers physiotherapy was the 
best supportive care treatment (SoC). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed 
that even in the most conservative scenario, assuming the worst case scenario, 
the probability of a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained below 
€40,000, for aboBoNT-A together with physiotherapy is above 0.8, and with 
certainty below €50,000/QALY when either a direct costs, or a societal 
perspective was taken. On average, the probabilistic model obtains a negative 
mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of around -15,000 €/QALY.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness analyses show that aboBoNT-A together with 
physiotherapy would be a cost-effective treatment compared with physiotherapy 
alone, independently of the perspective considered.

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the major public health challenges worldwide. 
Studies that address the new evidence on trends of BC are of great importance 
for preventing and controlling the occurrence and development of diseases and 
improving health. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes for the 
global burden of disease (GBD), incidence, deaths, and risk factors for BC from 
1990 to 2019, and predict the GBD of BC until 2050 to inform global BC control 
planning efforts. In this study, the results show that the regions with low 
levels of socio-demographic index (SDI) will have the largest disease burden of 
BC in the future. The leading global risk factor for death attributable to BC in 
2019 was metabolic risks, followed by behavioral risks. This study supports the 
worldwide urgent need for comprehensive cancer prevention and control strategies 
to reduce exposure, early screening, and improve treatment to effectively reduce 
the GBD of BC.

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with reduced life 
expectancy in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Voice analysis may be a 
convenient method for diagnosing and monitoring CFRD. This study aims to 
determine the relationship between voice characteristics and markers of glucose 
and glycemic control and to identify if voice analysis can predict high blood 
glucose levels and glycemic control in adults with CFRD. We conducted a 
prospective cross-sectional study in adults with CF from March to December 2021. 
We recorded 3-second voice samples of a sustained /a/ vowel and analyzed voice 
characteristic using the Computerized Speech Lab with the Multi-Dimensional 
Voice Program. In female participants with CFRD, the noise-to-harmonic ratio was 
significantly lower in those with HbA1c ≥ 7. Furthermore, fundamental frequency 
variation was significantly lower in both male and female participants with CFRD 
who had a glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher at the time of collection. This 
finding was also associated with a high level of point-of-care glucose. The 
human voice has potential as a non-invasive tool for measuring glucose levels 
and glycemic control status in CFRD patients in the future.

BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling tests can predict the risk of disease 
recurrence and select patients who are expected to benefit from therapy, while 
allowing other patients to forgo therapy. For breast cancers, these tests were 
initially designed to tailor chemotherapy decisions, but recent evidence 
suggests that they may also guide the use of endocrine therapy. This study 
evaluated the cost effectiveness of a prognostic test, MammaPrint®, to guide the 
use of adjuvant endocrine therapy in patients eligible according to Dutch 
treatment guidelines.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov decision model to calculate the lifetime costs 
(in 2020 Euros) and effects (survival and quality-adjusted life-years) of 
MammaPrint® testing versus usual care (endocrine therapy for all patients) in a 
simulated cohort of patients. The population of interest includes patients for 
whom MammaPrint® testing is currently not indicated, but for whom it may be 
possible to safely omit endocrine therapy. We applied both a health care 
perspective and a societal perspective and discounted costs (4%) and effects 
(1.5%). Model inputs were obtained from published research (including randomized 
controlled trials), nationwide cancer registry data, cohort data and publicly 
available data sources. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
explore the impact of uncertainty around input parameters. Additionally, 
threshold analyses were performed to identify under which circumstances 
MammaPrint® testing would be cost effective.
RESULTS: Adjuvant endocrine therapy guided by MammaPrint® resulted in fewer side 
effects, more (quality-adjusted) life-years (0.10 and 0.07 incremental QALYS and 
LYs, respectively) and higher costs (€18,323 incremental costs) compared with 
the usual care strategy in which all patients receive endocrine therapy. While 
costs for hospital visits, medication costs and productivity costs were somewhat 
higher in the usual care strategy, these did not outweigh costs of testing in 
the MammaPrint® strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €185,644 
per QALY gained from a healthcare perspective and €180,617 from a societal 
perspective. Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed that the conclusions 
remained the same under changed input parameters and assumptions. Our results 
show that MammaPrint® can become a cost-effective strategy when either the price 
of the test is reduced (> 50%), or the proportion of patients for which 
treatment is altered (i.e. those with ultra-low risk) increases to > 26%.
CONCLUSION: Standard MammaPrint® testing to guide the use of endocrine therapy 
in our simulated patient population appears not to be a cost-effective strategy 
compared with usual care. The cost effectiveness of the test can be improved by 
reducing the price or preselecting a population more likely to benefit from the 
test.

PURPOSE: To determine the macrovascular and microvascular function responses to 
resistance training with blood flow restriction (BFR) compared to high-load 
resistance training (HLRT) control group.
METHODS: Twenty-four young, healthy men were randomly assigned to BFR or HLRT. 
Participants performed bilateral knee extensions and leg presses 4 days per 
week, for 4 weeks. For each exercise, BFR completed 3 X 10 repetitions/day at 
30% of 1-repetition max (RM). The occlusive pressure was applied at 1.3 times of 
individual systolic blood pressure. The exercise prescription was identical for 
HLRT, except the intensity was set at 75% of one repetition maximum. Outcomes 
were measured pre-, at 2- and 4-weeks during the training period. The primary 
macrovascular function outcome was heart-ankle pulse wave velocity (haPWV), and 
the primary microvascular function outcome was tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) 
area under the curve (AUC) response to reactive hyperemia.
RESULTS: Knee extension and leg press 1-RM increased by 14% for both groups. 
There was a significant interaction effect for haPWV, decreasing - 5% 
(Δ-0.32 m/s, 95% confidential interval [CI] - 0.51 to - 0.12, effect size 
[ES] =  - 0.53) for BFR and increasing 1% (Δ0.03 m/s, 95%CI - 0.17 to 0.23, 
ES = 0.05) for HLRT. Similarly, there was an interaction effect for StO2 AUC, 
increasing 5% (Δ47%･s, 95%CI - 3.07 to 98.1, ES = 0.28) for HLRT and 17% 
(Δ159%･s, 95%CI 108.23-209.37, ES = 0.93) for BFR group.
CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest that BFR may improve macro- and 
microvascular function compared to HLRT.

BACKGROUND: Patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA) have altered hip 
kinematics compared to healthy controls, specifically hip extension and range of 
motion are lower. Exploring pelvis-thigh coordination patterns and coordination 
variability may help to elucidate why differences in hip kinematics are evident 
in patients following THA.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Do sagittal plane hip, pelvis and thigh kinematics, and 
pelvis-thigh movement coordination and coordination variability differ between 
patients following THA and healthy controls during walking?
METHODS: Sagittal plane hip, pelvis and thigh kinematics were collected using a 
three-dimensional motion capture system while 10 patients who had undergone THA 
and 10 controls walked at a self-selected pace. A modified vector coding 
technique was used to quantify pelvis-thigh coordination and coordination 
variability patterns. Peak hip, pelvis and thigh kinematics and ranges of 
motion, and movement coordination and coordination variability patterns were 
quantified and compared between groups.
RESULTS: Patients after THA have significantly (p ≤ .036; g ≥ 0.995) smaller 
peak hip extension and range of motion, and peak thigh anterior tilt and range 
of motion compared to controls. Additionally, patients following THA have 
significantly (p ≤ .037; g ≥ 0.646) more in-phase distally and less anti-phase 
distally dominated pelvis-thigh movement coordination patterns compared to 
controls.
SIGNIFICANCE: The smaller peak hip extension and range of motion displayed by 
patients following THA is due to smaller peak anterior tilt of the thigh, which 
in turn limits thigh range of motion. The lower sagittal plane thigh, and in 
turn hip, motion used by patients after THA may be due to increases in the 
in-phase coordination of pelvis-thigh motion patterns, which cause the pelvis 
and thigh to work as a singular functional unit.

BACKGROUND: Patients with renal disease on dialysis have significant comorbidity 
limiting life expectancy; however, these patients may experience accelerated 
prosthetic valve degeneration. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
impact of prosthesis choice on outcomes in dialysis patients undergoing mitral 
valve replacement (MVR) at our high-volume academic center.
METHODS: Adults undergoing MVR were retrospectively reviewed between January 
2002 and November 2019. Patients were included if they had documented renal 
failure and dialysis requirements before presentation. Patients were stratified 
by mechanical vs bioprosthetic prosthesis. Death and recurrent severe valve 
failure (3+ or greater) or redo mitral operation were used as primary outcomes.
RESULTS: There were 177 dialysis patients identified who underwent MVR. Of 
these, 118 (66.7%) received bioprosthetic valves, whereas 59 (33.3%) received 
mechanical valves. Those who received mechanical valves were younger (48 vs 61 
years; P < .001) and had less diabetes (32% vs 51%; P = .019). Prevalence of 
endocarditis and atrial fibrillation was similar. Postoperative length of stay 
was not different between groups. Risk-adjusted hazard for 5-year mortality was 
similar between groups (P = .668). Early mortality was high, with both groups 
having <50% actuarial survival at 2 years. No differences were noted in rates of 
structural valve deterioration or reintervention. More stroke events were noted 
on follow-up in patients receiving mechanical valves (15% vs 6%; P = .041). 
Endocarditis was the leading reason for reintervention; 4 patients received 
repeated surgery for bioprosthetic valve failure.
CONCLUSIONS: MVR in dialysis patients carries significant morbidity and 
increased midterm mortality. Decreased life expectancy should be considered in 
the tailoring of prosthesis choice to dialysis-dependent patients.

Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), also known as keratinocyte growth factor 
(KGF), shows a crucial biological significance in tissue development, wound 
repair, tumorigenesis, and immune reconstruction. In the skeletal system, FGF7 
directs the cellular synaptic extension of individual cells and facilities 
functional gap junction intercellular communication of a collective of cells. 
Moreover, it promotes the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells via a 
cytoplasmic signaling network. For cartilage, reports have indicated the 
potential role of FGF7 on the regulation of key molecules Cx43 in cartilage and 
Runx2 in hypertrophic cartilage. However, the molecular mechanism of FGF7 in 
chondrocyte behaviors and cartilage pathological process remains largely 
unknown. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent biological 
function of FGF7 and its regulatory role on chondrocytes and cartilage diseases, 
especially through the hot focus of two key molecules, Runx2 and Cx43. The 
current knowledge of FGF7 on the physiological and pathological processes of 
chondrocytes and cartilage provides us new cues for wound repair of cartilage 
defect and therapy of cartilage diseases.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare, autoimmune, classical complement 
pathway (CP)-mediated hemolytic anemia. Sutimlimab selectively inhibits C1s of 
the C1 complex, preventing CP activation while leaving the alternative and 
lectin pathways intact. In Part A (26 weeks) of the open-label, single-arm, 
Phase 3 CARDINAL study in patients with CAD and a recent history of transfusion, 
sutimlimab demonstrated rapid effects on hemolysis and anemia. Results of the 
CARDINAL study Part B (2-year extension) study, described herein, demonstrated 
that sutimlimab sustains improvements in hemolysis, anemia, and quality of life 
over a median of 144 weeks of treatment. Mean last-available on-treatment values 
in Part B were improved from baseline for hemoglobin (12.2 g/dL on-treatment 
versus 8.6 g/dL at baseline), bilirubin (16.5 μmol/L on-treatment versus 
52.1 μmol/L at baseline), and FACIT-Fatigue scores (40.5 on-treatment versus 
32.4 at baseline). In the 9-week follow-up period after sutimlimab cessation, CP 
inhibition was reversed, and hemolytic markers and fatigue scores approached 
pre-sutimlimab values. Overall, sutimlimab was generally well tolerated in Part 
B. All 22 patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE); 12 
(54.5%) patients experienced ≥1 serious TEAE, including seven (31.8%) with ≥1 
serious infection. Three patients discontinued due to a TEAE. No patients 
developed systemic lupus erythematosus or meningococcal infections. After 
cessation of sutimlimab, most patients reported adverse events consistent with 
recurrence of CAD. In conclusion, the CARDINAL 2-year results provide evidence 
of sustained sutimlimab effects for CAD management, but that disease activity 
reoccurs after treatment cessation. NCT03347396. Registered November 20, 2017.
