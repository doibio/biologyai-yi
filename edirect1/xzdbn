different % loss in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) against possible benefits of 
avoiding life years lost, for different scenarios where current COVID-19 
mortality and comorbidity rates were used to calculate the loss in life 
expectancy and adjusted for their levels of poor health and quality of life. We 
then apply a quality-adjusted life years (QALY) value of £30,000 (maximum under 
national guidelines).
RESULTS: There was a rapid spread of cases and significant variation both in 
severity and timing of both implementation and subsequent reductions in social 
restrictions. There was less variation in the trajectory of mortality rates and 
excess deaths, which have fallen across all countries during May/June 2020. The 
average age at death and life expectancy loss for non-COVID-19 was 79.1 and 
11.4 years, respectively, while COVID-19 were 80.4 and 10.1 years; including 
adjustments for life-shortening comorbidities and quality of life plausibly 
reduces this to around 5 QALY lost for each COVID-19 death. The lowest estimate 
for lockdown costs incurred was 40% higher than highest benefits from avoiding 
the worst mortality case scenario at full life expectancy tariff and in more 
realistic estimations they were over 5 times higher. Future scenarios showed in 
the best case a QALY value of £220k (7xNICE guideline) and in the worst-case 
£3.7m (125xNICE guideline) was needed to justify the continuation of lockdown.
CONCLUSION: This suggests that the costs of continuing severe restrictions are 
so great relative to likely benefits in lives saved that a rapid easing in 
restrictions is now warranted.

INTRODUCTION: This study sought to determine the impact of a ketogenic dietary 
intervention on the quality of life of stage II and III cancer patients.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was implemented whereby patients in the 
treatment group followed a modified ketogenic diet (KD) utilizing medium chained 
triglyceride fats during a four-month period, while the control group followed 
an institutionalized standard traditional diet. Quality of life and mental 
health status was assessed using The European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer current core questionnaire and The Patient Health 
Questionnaire. Intervention effects were assessed using repeated measures ANCOVA 
and multiple linear regression models.
RESULTS: The quality of life and mental health of the cancer patients in the 
treatment group were greatly increased and improved due to the utilization of 
the diet. Most of the persons in the treatment group attained and maintained 
ketosis after 2 weeks. Age, gender, and state of the disease seemed to affect 
the keto-adaptation period in terms of the time taken to keto-adapt.
CONCLUSION: The KD was suitable for stage II and III cancer patients in 
improving their quality of life, nutritional, functional, and psychosocial 
statuses.

How anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of present-day 
agricultural conservation practices remains a key uncertainty that could benefit 
water quality and biodiversity conservation planning. To explore this issue, we 
forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) 
would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) 
implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: 
moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020-2065. We 
used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land 
use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted 
regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat 
would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our 
models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP 
implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs 
influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those 
of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied 
responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would 
reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium 
life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing 
(e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat for 
warm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories 
(e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to 
increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, 
suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other 
ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our 
findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing 
strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of 
physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological 
conservation planning in a changing climate.

AIMS: Given the concerns of health inequality associated with mental illnesses, 
we aimed to reveal the extent of which general mortality and life expectancy at 
birth in people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depressive disorder 
varied in the 2005 and 2010 nationally representative cohorts in Taiwan.
METHODS: Two nationally representative samples of individuals with 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depressive disorder were identified from 
Taiwan's national health insurance database in 2005 and 2010, respectively, and 
followed-up for consecutive 3 years. The database was linked to nationwide 
mortality registry to identify causes and date of death. Age-, gender- and 
cause-specific mortality rates were generated, with the average follow-up period 
of each age- and gender-band applied as 'weighting' for the calculation of 
expected number of deaths. Age- and gender-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) 
were calculated for these 3-year observation periods with Taiwanese general 
population in 2011/2012 as the standard population. The SMR calculations were 
then stratified by natural/unnatural causes and major groups of death. 
Corresponding life expectancies at birth were also calculated by gender, 
diagnosis of mental disorders and year of cohorts for further elucidation.
RESULTS: The general differential in mortality rates for people with 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder remained wide, revealing an SMR of 3.65 (95% 
confidence interval (CI): 3.55-3.76) for cohort 2005 and 3.27 (3.18-3.36) for 
cohort 2010 in schizophrenia, and 2.65 (95% CI: 2.55-2.76) for cohort 2005 and 
2.39 (2.31-2.48) for cohort 2010 in bipolar disorder, respectively. The SMRs in 
people with depression were 1.83 (95% CI: 1.81-1.86) for cohort 2005 and 1.59 
(1.57-1.61) for cohort 2010. SMRs due to unnatural causes tended to decrease in 
people with major mental illnesses over the years, but those due to natural 
causes remained relatively stable. The life expectancies at birth for 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression were all significantly lower than 
the national norms, specifically showing 14.97-15.50 years of life lost for men 
and 15.15-15.48 years for women in people with schizophrenia.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to general population, the differential in mortality rates 
for people with major mental illnesses persisted substantial. The differential 
in mortality for unnatural causes of death seemed decreasing over the years, but 
that due to natural causes remained relatively steady. Regardless of gender, 
people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression were shown to have 
shortened life expectancies compared to general population.

BACKGROUND: The phenotype profiling of individuals with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) according to impairments in body composition and level 
of physical activity in daily life (PADL) needs to be determined.
OBJECTIVE: To verify if individuals with COPD classified as physically 
active/inactive present different characteristics within different body 
composition phenotypes.
METHODS: Individuals with COPD were cross-sectionally stratified into four 
groups according to fat-free and fat mass indexes: Normal Body Composition 
(NBC), Obese (Ob), Sarcopenic (Sarc), and Sarcopenic/Obese (Sarc/Ob). 
Additionally, individuals had their PADL level objectively assessed through 
activity monitoring during two weekdays for at least 10h/day, and then were 
classified as physically active (Act) or inactive (Inact) according to 
international recommendations. Lung function (spirometry), exercise capacity 
(6-minute walking test [6MWT]) and peripheral muscle strength (1-repetition 
maximum [1RM]) were also assessed.
RESULTS: 176 individuals with COPD (mean±standard deviation age: 67±8 years, 
body mass index 26±6kg/m2, FEV1 47±16%predicted) were classified as: NBC+Act 
(17%), NBC+Inact (22%), Ob+Act (6%), Ob+Inact (10%), Sarc+Act (12%), Sarc+Inact 
(9%), Sarc/Ob+Act (8%) and Sarc/Ob+Inact (16%). The Sarc/Ob+Inact group 
presented lower 6MWT and 1RM for knee extension compared to NBC+Act, NBC+Inact, 
and Ob+Act groups (p<0.05). The Sarc/Ob+Inact group also presented lower FEV1% 
predicted, 1RM for elbow flexion and elbow extension compared to the NBC+Act and 
NBC+Inact groups and lower 1RM for elbow extension compared to Ob+Inact group 
(p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The combination of sarcopenia, obesity, and physical inactivity was 
shown to be detrimental in individuals with COPD. Therefore, this profile is a 
main therapeutic target for improving PADL level and/or body composition.

The mechanical and thermophysical properties of Xenotime-type REPO4 (RE = Lu, 
Yb, Er, Y and Sc) have been theoretically and experimentally investigated for a 
potential environmental barrier coating (EBC) topcoat application. The results 
show that the current studied REPO4 exhibits a quasi-ductile property, 
suggesting a potential long life expectancy of its made coatings. Further, from 
the study of underlying parameters governing thermophysical properties of a 
ceramic, low thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) and low thermal 
conductivities cannot be achieved simultaneously, due to mutual exclusive nature 
of above two parameters. REPO4 has been unveiled to have rather small TECs, 
attributing partly to its weak lattice anharmonicity, and is thus well-matched 
with silicon carbide based ceramic matrix composites. Last, the current 
investigated REPO4 exhibits very good high-temperature water vapor corrosion 
resistance, excellent calcium-magnesium aluminosilicates (CMAS) resistance as 
well as excellent chemical compatibility with silicon bond coats at elevated 
temperatures. Therefore, the Xenotime-type rare earth phosphates are a promising 
EBC topcoat material.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common worldwide cause of intellectual disability 
of genetic origin and the most common chromosomal disorder affecting live-born 
infants. In addition to intellectual disability, individuals with DS have other 
comorbidities and complex medical conditions. The increase in the life 
expectancy of patients with DS requires expanding the knowledge about their 
clinical characteristics and related laboratory parameters. Several studies 
exploring laboratory tests in DS patients exist, but their focus is limited to 
specific areas of metabolism. Therefore, our main goal was to describe the 
biochemical and hematological findings in a DS cohort and to compare the values 
to those of a control population. A total of 248 DS individuals and 84 control 
subjects were enrolled. DS individuals had a higher frequency of several 
clinical conditions compared to control individuals and presented with 
significant differences with respect to the controls in both biochemical and 
hematological parameters. We found age- and sex-related differences in several 
of the parameters. A good understanding of the differences in our cohort might 
be of aid in the clinical follow-up of adults with DS, especially considering 
that the lifespan of DS individuals may reach 60 years of age in developed 
countries.

In this study, the extension of theory of planned behavior was developed to 
evaluate the effects of antecedents that influence consumers' intention to buy 
green products. The effect of nine determinants (i.e., individual benefits, 
social benefits, willingness-to-pay, environmental responsibility, 
e-word-of-mouth, values, self-competence, convenience, and environmental 
literacy) of the green wave on Taiwanese consumers was empirically tested by 
examining their perception of social responsibility through theory of planned 
behavior. Except for consumer subjective norms, the remaining factors exhibited 
significant positive correlations with the planned behavior, implying that the 
voluntary participation aspect of the green wave is considerably more critical 
than its mandatory social pressure. To diffuse this green wave more effectively, 
the Taiwanese government should encourage consumers to easily capture the 
detailed impact of the green wave on the society and allow consumers to use 
word-of-mouth marketing for the creation of relational value to improve their 
quality of life.

Technology, Haifa, Israel.

Background: Ecological and physiological factors and social and economic 
constraints affect sex-specific body size. Here, we used the male/female (M/F) 
height ratio as an indicator of the combined effect of genetic and sex 
characteristics. We hypothesized that (1) sexual dimorphism in body size will be 
established during infancy and adolescence when growth velocity is maximal, (2) 
living standards and health are important factors which can affect sexual 
dimorphism in body size, (3) variations in sexual dimorphism in body size are 
due to the differential response of boys and girls to environmental cues, and 
(4) sexual dimorphism in body size will be more pronounced in those populations 
whose average height and weight are the greatest. Methods: To study the ontogeny 
of sexual dimorphism from birth until the age of 18 years, we used the 2000 CDC 
growth data. Data on height by country, life expectancy, and gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita based on purchasing power parity were extracted from 
the national accounts data of NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, the World Bank, 
Eurostat: Demographic Statistics, Secretariat of the Pacific Community: 
Statistics and Demography Program, and the US Census Bureau. Results: We found 
that sexual dimorphism in body size starts at age 1 month, peaks at age 3 
months, and diminishes by age 24 months. During childhood, there is no sexual 
difference in body size, and it is gradually established when the boys enter 
puberty. The M/F height ratio correlates positively with the average male and 
female height and weight by country. Conclusion: Sexual dimorphism in body size 
occurs when (a) the growth velocity is maximal during infancy and adolescence, 
(b) living standards are high, and health correlate positively with male/female 
height ratio. Anthropological studies and our results emphasize mostly the 
female resiliency hypothesis: shorter male heights in times of environmental 
stress lead to smaller sexual dimorphism in body size.

Increased life expectancy in modern society comes at the cost of age-associated 
disabilities and diseases. Aged brains not only show reduced excitability and 
plasticity, but also a decline in inhibition. Age-associated defects in 
inhibitory circuits likely contribute to cognitive decline and age-related 
disorders. Molecular mechanisms that exert epigenetic control of gene expression 
contribute to age-associated neuronal impairments. Both DNA methylation, 
mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and histone modifications maintain 
neuronal function throughout lifespan. Here we provide evidence that DNMT1 
function is implicated in the age-related loss of cortical inhibitory 
interneurons. Dnmt1 deletion in parvalbumin-positive interneurons attenuates 
their age-related decline in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, conditional 
Dnmt1-deficient mice show improved somatomotor performance and reduced 
aging-associated transcriptional changes. A decline in the proteostasis network, 
responsible for the proper degradation and removal of defective proteins, is 
implicated in age- and disease-related neurodegeneration. Our data suggest that 
DNMT1 acts indirectly on interneuron survival in aged mice by modulating the 
proteostasis network during life-time.

Peritrochanteric fractures are the most common fragility fractures for which 
patient are admitted in hospital and often require surgical interventions. With 
increasing life expectancy and early age of presentation, revision surgeries are 
increasing due to re-trauma, implant failure, infections etc. Here we present 
the case of a 65 years female, with inter trochanteric fracture femur right side 
with ipsilateral malunited proximal femur fracture, which was managed with 
customised proximal femoral nail. This case exemplifies the need for novel 
techniques and implants in our armamentarium to deal with such unusual fractures 
in elderly population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Adults older than 75 years are overscreened for 
cancer, especially those with less than 10-year life expectancy. This study 
aimed to learn the effects of providing primary care providers (PCPs) with 
scripts for discussing stopping mammography and colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening and with information on patient's 10-year life expectancy on their 
patients' intentions to be screened for these cancers.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patient participants, identified via PCP 
appointment logs, completed a questionnaire pre- and postvisit. Primary care 
providers were given scripts for discussing stopping screening and information 
on patient's 10-year life expectancy before these visits. Primary care providers 
completed a questionnaire at the end of the study. Patients and PCPs were asked 
about discussing stopping cancer screening and patient life expectancy. Patient 
screening intentions (1-15 Likert scale; lower scores suggest lower intentions) 
were compared pre- and postvisit using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: Ninety patients older than 75 years (47% of eligible patients reached 
by phone) from 45 PCPs participated. Patient mean age was 80.0 years (SD = 2.9), 
43 (48%) were female, and mean life expectancy was 9.7 years (SD = 2.4). 
Thirty-seven PCPs (12 community-based) completed a questionnaire. Primary care 
providers found the scripts helpful (32 [89%]) and thought they would use them 
frequently (29 [81%]). Primary care providers also found patient life expectancy 
information helpful (35 [97%]). However, only 8 PCPs (22%) reported feeling 
comfortable discussing patient life expectancy. Patients' intentions to undergo 
CRC screening (9.0 [SD = 5.3] to 6.5 [SD = 6.0], p < .0001) and mammography 
screening (12.9 [SD = 3.0] to 11.7 [SD = 4.9], p = .08) decreased from pre- to 
postvisit (significantly for CRC). Sixty-three percent of patients (54/86) were 
interested in discussing life expectancy with their PCP previsit and 56% (47/84) 
postvisit.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: PCPs found scripts for discussing stopping cancer 
screening and information on patient life expectancy helpful. Possibly, as a 
result, their patients older than 75 years had lower intentions of being 
screened for CRC.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy for people with an intellectual disability 
increases, there is a growing cohort of older father carers. This study aimed to 
gain a more in-depth understanding of older father carers' experiences of 
parenting.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 7 older fathers 
(M = 63.9 years) and analysed using constructivist grounded theory.
RESULTS: Three conceptual categories were identified. "Wearing different hats: 
how fathers' sense of identity had altered over the years. "Family comes first": 
importance placed on the family unit. "Getting on in years": the challenges 
faced by ageing fathers parenting their son/daughter.
CONCLUSIONS: Fathers re-evaluated their priorities and found a new identity in 
their parenting role, although they continued to see themselves as secondary 
carers. Fathers worried about the future as their health declined but drew 
strength from the benefits they had derived and the challenges that they had 
overcome to do their best for their son/daughter and their family.

The constant increase in the graying population is the result of a great 
expansion of life expectancy. A smaller expansion of healthy cognitive and brain 
functioning diminishes the gains achieved by longevity. Music training, as a 
special case of multisensory learning, may induce restorative neuroplasticity in 
older ages. The current study aimed to explore aging effects on the cortical 
network supporting multisensory cognition and to define aging effects on the 
network's neuroplastic attributes. A computer-based music reading protocol was 
developed and evaluated via electroencephalography measurements pre- and 
post-training on young and older adults. Results revealed that multisensory 
integration is performed via diverse strategies in the two groups: Older adults 
employ higher-order supramodal areas to a greater extent than lower level 
perceptual regions, in contrast to younger adults, indicating an age-related 
shift in the weight of each processing strategy. Restorative neuroplasticity was 
revealed in the left inferior frontal gyrus and right medial temporal gyrus, as 
a result of the training, while task-related reorganization of cortical 
connectivity was obstructed in the group of older adults, probably due to 
systemic maturation mechanisms. On the contrary, younger adults significantly 
increased functional connectivity among the regions supporting multisensory 
integration.

Biological control is widely successful at controlling pests, but effective 
biocontrol agents are now more difficult to import from countries of origin due 
to more restrictive international trade laws (the Nagoya Protocol). Coupled with 
increasing demand, the efficacy of existing and new biocontrol agents needs to 
be improved with genetic and genomic approaches. Although they have been 
underutilised in the past, application of genetic and genomic techniques is 
becoming more feasible from both technological and economic perspectives. We 
review current methods and provide a framework for using them. First, it is 
necessary to identify which biocontrol trait to select and in what direction. 
Next, the genes or markers linked to these traits need be determined, including 
how to implement this information into a selective breeding program. Choosing a 
trait can be assisted by modelling to account for the proper agro-ecological 
context, and by knowing which traits have sufficiently high heritability values. 
We provide guidelines for designing genomic strategies in biocontrol programs, 
which depend on the organism, budget, and desired objective. Genomic approaches 
start with genome sequencing and assembly. We provide a guide for deciding the 
most successful sequencing strategy for biocontrol agents. Gene discovery 
involves quantitative trait loci analyses, transcriptomic and proteomic studies, 
and gene editing. Improving biocontrol practices includes marker-assisted 
selection, genomic selection and microbiome manipulation of biocontrol agents, 
and monitoring for genetic variation during rearing and post-release. We 
conclude by identifying the most promising applications of genetic and genomic 
methods to improve biological control efficacy.

Ectopic gas is defined as the presence of gas in abnormal locations, that is, 
outside the aerodigestive tract. It constitutes a common radiologic finding 
associated with a wide range of disorders. Although it is usually an innocuous 
and self-limited condition, it should prompt a search for the underlying cause, 
given that the clinical significance of ectopic gas varies from benign to life 
threatening, depending on the site involved and the rate of accumulation. To 
ensure optimal management of each case, the origin of ectopic gas should be 
determined. The search for its exact location and underlying cause often 
represents a challenge, as air can be depicted distant from its point of origin 
because of fascial interconnectivity. Thorough knowledge of anatomic 
compartments facilitates quick identification of the cause and contributes to a 
prompt diagnosis. Likewise, radiologists should be familiar with the alarm signs 
associated with severe conditions. Imaging studies are essential to help the 
radiologist confirm the diagnosis of ectopic gas, determine its precise location 
and extension, identify severe cases, exclude associated complications, and 
monitor evolution. CT is the modality of choice in the imaging assessment of 
ectopic gas. In this review, the authors discuss the different causes of ectopic 
gas with an etiopathogenic approach to describe the myriad processes that might 
give rise to this condition. In addition, alarm signs associated with 
potentially fatal ectopic gas are described and depicted. ©RSNA, 2020.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important but difficult to study human pathogen. 
Most basics of the hepadnaviral life-cycle were unraveled using duck HBV (DHBV) 
as a model although DHBV has a capsid protein (CP) comprising ~260 rather than 
~180 amino acids. Here we present high-resolution structures of several DHBV 
capsid-like particles (CLPs) determined by electron cryo-microscopy. As for HBV, 
DHBV CLPs consist of a dimeric α-helical frame-work with protruding spikes at 
the dimer interface. A fundamental new feature is a ~ 45 amino acid proline-rich 
extension in each monomer replacing the tip of the spikes in HBV CP. In vitro, 
folding of the extension takes months, implying a catalyzed process in vivo. 
DHBc variants lacking a folding-proficient extension produced regular CLPs in 
bacteria but failed to form stable nucleocapsids in hepatoma cells. We propose 
that the extension domain acts as a conformational switch with differential 
response options during viral infection.

We investigated the hypothesis that the endocannabinoidome (eCBome), an 
extension of the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system with important functions 
in the CNS, may play a role in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Using LC-MS/MS and 
qPCR arrays we profiled the brain eCBome of juvenile (4 weeks) and adult 
(13 weeks) male and female germ-free (GF) mice, which are raised in sterile 
conditions and virtually devoid of microbiota, present neurophysiological 
deficits, and were found recently to exhibit a strongly altered gut eCBome in 
comparison to conventionally raised age/sex-matched controls. The causal effect 
of the gut microbiome on the eCBome was investigated through the re-introduction 
into adult male GF mice of a functional gut microbiota by fecal microbiota 
transfer (FMT). The concentrations of the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), 
and its 2-monoacylglycerol congeners, were significantly reduced in the brain, 
but not in the hypothalamus, of both juvenile and adult male and adult female GF 
mice. FMT rendered these decreases non-statistically significant. The eCB, 
anandamide (AEA), and its congener N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), were instead 
increased in the brain of adult female GF mice. Saturated fatty acid-containing 
NAEs were decreased in adult male GF mouse hypothalamus in a manner not reversed 
by FMT. Only few changes were observed in the expression of eCBome enzymes and 
receptors. Our data open the possibility that altered eCBome signaling may 
underlie some of the brain dysfunctions typical of GF mice.

OBJECTIVES: Despite new therapeutic perspectives, the presence of central 
airways occlusion (CAO) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) is associated with poor survival. There is no clear evidence on 
the clinical impact of interventional bronchoscopy as a part of an integrated 
treatment to cure these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in two 
teaching hospitals over a 10 years period (January 2010-January 2020) comparing 
patients with NSCLC at stage IIIB and CAO at disease onset treated with 
chemotherapy/radiotherapy (standard therapy-ST) with those receiving 
interventional bronchoscopy plus ST (integrated treatment-IT). Primary outcome 
was 1-year survival. The onset of respiratory events, symptoms-free interval, 
hospitalization, need for palliation, and overall mortality served as secondary 
outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included, 60 in the IT and 40 in the ST
