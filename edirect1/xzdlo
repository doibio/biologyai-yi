specific biomarkers for PD, and especially PD with associated psychiatric 
symptomatology. Discoveries in the fields of metagenomics, transcriptomics and 
proteomics, may lead to an improved comprehension of the metabolic pathways 
involved in disease etiology and progression and contribute to the discovery of 
novel therapeutic targets for effective treatment options.

Talipariti tiliaceum is an evergreen mangrove associate species distributed 
throughout the world. In this study, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
T. tiliaceum was assembled and characterized using high-throughput sequencing 
data. The chloroplast genome was found to be 161 766 bp in length, consisting of 
large single-copy (LSC) and small single-copy (SSC) regions of 89 273 and 19 
551 bp, respectively, which were separated by a pair of 26 471 bp inverted 
repeat (IR) regions. The genome contained 129 genes, including 84 protein-coding 
genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. A phylogenetic tree including 66 
chloroplast genomes from various species revealed that T. tiliaceum was most 
related to T. hamabo of the same genus.

A Digital Mobile Community App for Caregivers in Singapore: Predevelopment and 
Usability Study.

Lwin MO(1), Sheldenkar A(1), Panchapakesan C(1).

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy and aging populations, the global 
prevalence of chronic diseases and the long-term care required for people with 
comorbidities is rising. This has led to an ever-growing need for caregiving. 
Previous literature has shown that caregivers face problems of isolation and 
loneliness. However, many health organizations mainly focus their efforts on 
in-person community groups that require participants to meet physically. This is 
not always convenient or accessible for caregivers who are often juggling caring 
for their care recipient with family and work responsibilities.
OBJECTIVE: With medical advancements such as the proliferation of mobile phones 
and internet technology, caregivers may have opportunities for easier access to 
resources and support. Technological innovations could help empower the 
caregiving community to seek assistance for improving their quality of life at 
their convenience. A community network app called Caregivers' Circle was 
conceptualized in response to the needs of the caregivers on a day-to-day 
caregiving journey. This paper traces the predevelopment inquiry and technical 
details of this app to provide a clear understanding of its implementation along 
with a usability study to gauge user opinion of the app within Singapore.
METHODS: A predevelopment survey was conducted to identify specific needs of 
caregivers and gaps in the currently available web-based community networks. The 
survey consisted of questions on demographical data, health-related issues of 
the care recipient, mental and physical health-related issues of the caregiver, 
digital media use, information seeking, and support. This pre-app development 
survey was completed by 103 caregivers. Qualitative enquiries were also 
conducted with caregivers within Singapore to identify issues related to 
caregiving, support provided, and what caregivers would want from a caregiving 
mobile app.
RESULTS: From the feedback garnered from the caregivers, the developers were 
able to identify several caregivers' needs and gaps within the current support 
networks. This feedback was integrated into the mobile app called Caregivers' 
Circle upon development. The features of this app include a public forum for 
community discussions, a marketplace to buy and sell items, care groups to hold 
private discussions with friends or other users of the app, and a friends 
feature to search and add new caregiving friends.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, the caregivers liked the Caregivers' Circle app and 
were confident that this app could help them have a better quality of life. The 
Caregivers' Circle app is unique in its integrated approach. The integration of 
many features that caregivers need on a daily basis into an easy app can save 
their time as well as help them navigate their life smoothly.

Portland, Oregon, USA.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the cost-effectiveness of three sequential prenatal 
cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening strategies: genotyping both partners, 
genotyping one partner then sequencing the second, and sequencing both partners.
METHOD: A decision-analytic model compared the strategies in a theoretical 
cohort of four million pregnant couples in the US population and five 
racial/ethnic sub-populations. Inputs were obtained from literature and varied 
in sensitivity analysis. Outcomes included cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY), missed carrier couples, affected newborns, missed prenatal diagnoses, 
terminations, and procedure-related losses. The cost-effectiveness threshold was 
$100,000/QALY.
RESULTS: Sequencing both partners identified 1099 carrier couples that were 
missed by genotyping both partners, leading to 273 fewer missed prenatal 
diagnoses, 152 more terminations, and 152 fewer affected newborns. A similar 
trend was observed in the genotyping followed by sequencing strategy. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of genotyping followed by sequencing 
compared to genotyping both partners was $180,004/QALY and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of sequencing both partners compared to genotyping 
followed by sequencing was $17.6 million/QALY. Sequencing both partners was 
cost-effective below $339 per test, genotyping/sequencing between $340 and 
$1837, and genotyping both partners above $1838. Sequencing was not 
cost-effective among five racial/ethnic sub-populations.
CONCLUSION: Despite improved outcomes, sequencing for prenatal CF carrier 
screening was not cost-effective compared to genotyping. The clinical 
significance of the incremental cost-effectiveness of CF carrier screening is a 
matter of deliberation for public policy debate.

Pediatric Palliative Care.

Moresco B(1), Moore D(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Pediatric Palliative Care, Department of Pediatrics, University 
of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

OBJECTIVE/METHODS: Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) is a multidisciplinary 
medical subspecialty focused on the care of children with serious illnesses and 
terminal diagnoses. Providers impact the care of children from the perinatal 
stage through adolescence/young adulthood and help patients and families face 
diagnoses such as complex chronic disease and malignancy. This article describes 
these unique populations and distinct areas of current PPC research.
RESULTS: Unique aspects of PPC include a high level of prognostic uncertainty, 
symptom burden, pediatric, and surrogate advance care planning, hope in the face 
of prognostic challenges, care of children at end of life, concurrent care, 
staff support, sibling support, and bereavement.
CONCLUSION: PPC's evolution from an extension of hospice into a continuum of 
support for families and staff caring for children with serious illnesses is 
exemplified in both qualitative and quantitative research. The literature proves 
the value that PPC can provide to families, hospitals, and communities. PPC is 
evolving from a supportive service into a uniquely beneficial, collaborative, 
educational, and interdisciplinary specialty that improves outcomes for all 
involved.Plain Language Summary (PLS)Pediatric Palliative Care (PPC) is a 
service provided to all children with serious illness as a way of addressing 
suffering. Populations served by PPC range from those not yet born to patients 
preparing for adulthood. The serious illnesses they face range from chronic 
disease to cancer. Over the last 20 years research has explored the unique 
aspects of the pediatric experience of serious illness, including prognostic 
uncertainty, concurrent care, symptom management, advance care planning, hope, 
family experience of illness, care at the end of life, staff support, and 
bereavement.As the number of patients who would benefit from PPC services 
rapidly expands nationally and worldwide, PPC teams provide education and skills 
training for their colleagues in primary and subspecialty fields. Hospitals 
benefit from PPC through improved patient experience, family-centered care, and 
staff support. Communities are served by PPC that occurs in and out of the 
hospital.Research in PPC provides guidance for challenging questions in care and 
has resulted in an increasingly robust body of work. PPC providers have skills 
of advanced communication training, hope in the face of uncertainty, targeted 
and personalized symptom management, and a diverse understanding of quality of 
life. These skills help support decision-making and establish strong connections 
between providers and families.The field of PPC has a distinct skillset to 
support families who face serious illness. This article helps medical and 
psychosocial providers visualize how PPC is evolving from what has often been 
explained to families as an added layer of support into a uniquely beneficial, 
collaborative, and interdisciplinary service.

Homeless people have more complex problems, poorer health and shorter life 
expectancy (14- 16 years) than others. They often stay in an unsafe environment. 
Loneliness and avoidance of care reinforce their health problems. One third has 
an intellectual disability. Doctors should tackle these problems together with 
non-medics. This requires: - Knowledge of their biography: you don't know what 
you (don't) see; - Alertness to previously (psychological and physical) trauma, 
sexual abuse and (partner-- related) violence, especially among women; - 
Integrated approach to substance abuse, debt and deviant behaviour to break a 
downward spiral; - Reporting when someone is uninsured, so that financing of 
care, an address and health insurance can be arranged; - Care beds to enable (1) 
care around operations and extreme underweight, and (2) arranging Identity Card, 
address, income and insurance; - Secondary prevention: cooperation between 
doctors and social work, addiction treatment and curator; - Fewer rules so that 
right of insurance, right of residence and care can advance the health of the 
homeless.

BACKGROUND: Family members of critically ill patients experience symptoms of 
postintensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F), including anxiety, depression, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder. Postintensive care syndrome-family reduces the 
quality of life of the families of critically ill patients and may impede the 
recovery of such patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy has become a first-line 
nonpharmacological treatment of many psychological symptoms and disorders, 
including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. With regard to managing 
mild-to-moderate symptoms, the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy via 
mobile technology without input from a clinician has been found to be feasible 
and well accepted, and its efficacy rivals that of face-to-face therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our pilot study is to examine the efficacy of using a 
smartphone mobile health (mHealth) app to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy 
and diminish the severity and prevalence of PICS-F symptoms in family members of 
critically ill patients.
METHODS: For our pilot study, 60 family members of critically ill patients will 
be recruited. A repeated-measures longitudinal study design that involves the 
randomization of participants to 2 groups (the control and intervention groups) 
will be used. The intervention group will receive cognitive behavioral therapy, 
which will be delivered via a smartphone mHealth app. Bandura's social cognitive 
theory and an emphasis on mental health self-efficacy form the theoretical 
framework of the study.
RESULTS: Recruitment for the study began in August 2020. Data collection and 
analysis are expected to be completed by March 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study represents a novel approach to the treatment of 
PICS-F symptoms and is an extension of previous work conducted by the research 
team. The study will be used to plan a fully powered randomized controlled 
trial.

IMPORTANCE: Although people receiving maintenance dialysis have limited life 
expectancy and a high burden of comorbidity, relatively few studies have 
examined spirituality and religious beliefs among members of this population.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there is an association between the importance of 
religious or spiritual beliefs and care preferences and palliative care needs in 
people who receive dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted 
among adults who were undergoing maintenance dialysis at 31 facilities in 
Seattle, Washington, and Nashville, Tennessee, between April 22, 2015, and 
October 2, 2018. The survey included a series of questions assessing patients' 
knowledge, preferences, values, and expectations related to end-of-life care. 
Data were analyzed from February 12, 2020, to April 21, 2021.
EXPOSURES: The importance of religious or spiritual beliefs was ascertained by 
asking participants to respond to this statement: "My religious or spiritual 
beliefs are what really lie behind my whole approach to life." Response options 
were definitely true, tends to be true, tends not to be true, or definitely not 
true.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures were based on self-reported 
engagement in advance care planning, resuscitation preferences, values regarding 
life prolongation, preferred place of death, decision-making preference, 
thoughts or discussion about hospice or stopping dialysis, prognostic 
expectations, and palliative care needs.
RESULTS: A total of 937 participants were included in the cohort, of whom the 
mean (SD) age was 62.8 (13.8) years and 524 (55.9%) were men. Overall, 435 
(46.4%) participants rated the statement about religious or spiritual beliefs as 
definitely true, 230 (24.6%) rated it as tends to be true, 137 (14.6%) rated it 
as tends not to be true, and 135 (14.4%) rated it as definitely not true. 
Participants for whom these beliefs were more important were more likely to 
prefer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (estimated probability for definitely true: 
69.8% [95% CI, 66.5%-73.2%]; tends to be true: 60.8% [95% CI, 53.4%-68.3%]; 
tends not to be true: 61.6% [95% CI, 53.6%-69.6%]; and definitely not true: 
60.6% [95% CI, 52.5%-68.6%]; P for trend = .003) and mechanical ventilation 
(estimated probability for definitely true: 42.6% [95% CI, 38.1%-47.0%]; tends 
to be true: 33.5% [95% CI, 25.9%-41.2%]; tends not to be true: 35.1% [95% CI, 
27.2%-42.9%]; and definitely not true: 27.9% [95% CI, 19.6%-36.1%]; P for 
trend = .002) and to prefer a shared role in decision-making (estimated 
probability for definitely true: 41.6% [95% CI, 37.7%-45.5%]; tends to be true: 
35.4% [95% CI, 29.0%-41.8%]; tends not to be true: 36.0% [95% CI, 26.7%-45.2%]; 
and definitely not true: 23.8% [95% CI, 17.3%-30.3%]; P for trend = .001) and 
were less likely to have thought or spoken about stopping dialysis. These 
participants were no less likely to have engaged in advance care planning, to 
value relief of pain and discomfort, to prefer to die at home, to have ever 
thought or spoken about hospice, and to have unmet palliative care needs and had 
similar prognostic expectations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The finding that religious or spiritual beliefs were 
important to most study participants suggests the value of an integrative 
approach that addresses these beliefs in caring for people who receive dialysis.

CONTEXT: Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by insufficient levels of 
parathyroid hormone (PTH). TransCon PTH is an investigational long-acting 
prodrug of PTH(1-34) for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism.
OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy 
of daily TransCon PTH in adults with hypoparathyroidism.
METHODS: This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week trial 
with open-label extension enrolled 59 individuals with hypoparathyroidism. 
Interventions included TransCon PTH 15, 18, or 21 µg PTH(1-34)/day or placebo 
for 4 weeks, followed by a 22-week extension during which TransCon PTH dose was 
titrated (6-60 µg PTH[1-34]/day).
RESULTS: By Week 26, 91% of participants treated with TransCon PTH achieved 
independence from standard of care (SoC, defined as active vitamin D = 0 μg/day 
and calcium [Ca] ≤ 500 mg/day). Mean 24-hour urine Ca (uCa) decreased from a 
baseline mean of 415 mg/24h to 178 mg/24h by Week 26 (n = 44) while normal serum 
Ca (sCa) was maintained and serum phosphate and serum calcium-phosphate product 
fell within the normal range. By Week 26, mean scores on the generic 36-Item 
Short Form Health Survey domains increased from below normal at baseline to 
within the normal range. The Hypoparathyroidism Patient Experience Scale symptom 
and impact scores improved through 26 weeks. TransCon PTH was well tolerated 
with no treatment-related serious or severe adverse events.
CONCLUSION: TransCon PTH enabled independence from oral active vitamin D and 
reduced Ca supplements (≤ 500 mg/day) for most participants, achieving normal 
sCa, serum phosphate, uCa, serum calcium-phosphate product, and demonstrating 
improved health-related quality of life. These results support TransCon PTH as a 
potential hormone replacement therapy for adults with hypoparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a complex health disorder that significantly increases 
the risk of several chronic diseases, and it has been associated with a 
5-20-year decrease in life expectancy. The prevalence of obesity is increasing 
steadily worldwide and Italy follows this trend with an increase of almost 30% 
in the adult obese population in the last 3 decades. Previous studies estimated 
that 2-4% of the total health expenditure in Europe is attributed to obesity and 
it is projected to double by 2050. Currently, there is a lack of sufficient 
knowledge on the burden of obesity in Italy and most relevant estimates are 
derived from international studies. The aim of this study is to estimate the 
direct and indirect costs of obesity in Italy, taking 2020 as the reference 
year.
METHODS: Based on data collected from the literature, a quantitative 
cost-of-illness (COI) study was performed from a societal perspective focussing 
on the adult obese population (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2) in Italy.
RESULTS: The study indicated that the total costs attributable to obesity in 
Italy amounted to €13.34 billion in 2020 (95% credible interval: €8.99 
billion < µ < €17.80 billion). Direct costs were €7.89 billion, with 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) having the highest impact on costs (€6.66 
billion), followed by diabetes (€0.65 billion), cancer (€0.33 billion), and 
bariatric surgery (€0.24 billion). Indirect costs amounted to €5.45 billion, 
with almost equal contribution of absenteeism (€2.62 billion) and presenteeism 
(€2.83 billion).
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with high direct and indirect costs, and 
cost-effective prevention programmes are deemed fundamental to contain this 
public health threat in Italy.

From Online Handwriting to Synthetic Images for Alzheimer's Disease Detection 
Using a Deep Transfer Learning Approach.

Cilia ND, D'Alessandro T, De Stefano C, Fontanella F, Molinara M.

Early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD), is very important to reduce their effects and to improve both quality and 
life expectancy of patients. In this context, it is generally agreed that 
handwriting is one of the first skills altered by the onset of AD. For this 
reason, the analysis of handwriting and the study of its alterations has become 
of great interest in order to formulate the diagnosis as soon as possible. A 
fundamental aspect for the use of these techniques is the definition of 
effective features, which allows the system to distinguish the natural 
alterations of handwriting due to age, from those caused by neurodegenerative 
disorders. Starting from these considerations, the aim of our study is to verify 
whether the combined use of both shape and dynamic features allows a decision 
support system to improve performance for AD diagnosis. To this purpose, 
starting from a database of on-line handwriting samples, we generated for each 
of them an off-line synthetic color image, where the color of each elementary 
trait encodes, in the three RGB channels, the dynamic information associated 
with that trait. To verify the role played by dynamic information, we also 
generated simple binary images, containing only shape information. Finally, we 
exploited the ability of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically 
extract features on both color and binary images. The experimental results have 
confirmed that dynamic information allows a performance improvement with respect 
to the binary images.

Button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is cultured commercially and consumed 
worldwide for its unique flavor, texture, and culinary qualities. The objective 
of this study was to assess the textural profile together with the phenolic 
content and antioxidant, antibacterial, and elemental composition of wild and 
commercially cultivated A. bisporus from China. Of the six mushroom strains 
studied, both cultivated strains CCMJ1013 (fresh: 85.8 N/m2; stored: 57.9 N/m2) 
and CCMJ1343 (fresh: 94.7 N/m2; stored: 52.9 N/m2) recorded elevated hardness. 
Our results revealed that wild A. bisporus strain CCMJ1363 contained the highest 
phenolic content (7.840 mg gallic acid equivalents [GAE]/g), followed by 
CCMJ1361 (7.125 mg GAE/g) and CCMJ1351 (6.709 mg GAE/g). Antioxidant activity 
was elevated in CCMJ1351 (inhibition concentration at 50% inhibition [IC50] = 
1.04 mg/mL) followed by CCMJ1361 (IC50 = 1.67 mg/mL) in the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay, whereas CCMJ1351 showed the maximum 
antioxidant activity (353.54 mg Trolox equivalents/g) in the ferric reducing 
antioxidant power assay. The maximum 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) 
di-hydrochloride-induced erythrocyte hemolysis inhibition was found in wild A. 
bisporus CCMJ1363 (86.09% inhibition) followed by CCMJ1351 (84.45% inhibition). 
In terms of antibacterial activity, only a wild A. bisporus strain (CCMJ1361) 
showed antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus coli and 
Staphylococcus aureus). Wild strain CCMJ1110 contained the highest level of zinc 
and magnesium; CCMJ1361 showed higher levels of calcium and iron, and CCMJ1363 
contained a comparatively higher composition of nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum. 
Therefore, the current study lays a foundation for creating high-performance, 
culinary-quality, and stress-resistant germplasms in breeding for A. bisporus 
strains.

PURPOSE: For curative treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy benefit 
must be weighed against toxicity. Although more costly, proton radiation therapy 
reduces dose to healthy tissue, potentially improving the therapeutic ratio 
compared with photons. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of proton 
versus photon therapy for mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma (MHL) based on reduced 
heart disease.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our model approach was 2-fold: (1) Use patient-level 
dosimetric information for a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov cohort 
model. (2) Use population-based data to develop guidelines for policymakers to 
determine thresholds of proton therapy favorability for a given photon dose. The 
HD14 trial informed relapse risk; coronary heart disease risk was informed by 
the Framingham risk calculator modified by the mean heart dose (MHD) from 
radiation. Sensitivity analyses assessed model robustness and identified the 
most influential model assumptions. A 30-year-old adult with MHL was the base 
case using 30.6-Gy proton therapy versus photon intensity modulated radiation 
therapy.
RESULTS: Proton therapy was not cost-effective in the base case for male 
($129,000/ quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) or female patients 
($196,000/QALY). A 5-Gy MHD decrease was associated with proton therapy 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$100,000/QALY in 40% of scenarios. The 
hazard ratio associating MHD and heart disease was the most influential clinical 
parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy may be cost-effective a select minority of patients 
with MHL based on age, sex, and MHD reduction. We present guidance for 
clinicians using MHD to aid decision-making for radiation therapy modality.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of schizophrenia lacks reliable medical diagnostic tests 
and robust biomarkers applied to clinical practice. Schizophrenic patients 
undergoing treatment with antipsychotics suffer reduced life expectancy due to 
metabolic disarrangements that co-exist with their mental illness and predispose 
them to develop metabolic syndrome, which is also exacerbated by medication. 
Metabolomics is an emerging and potent technology able to accelerate this 
biomedical research.
AIM: This review focus on a detailed vision of the molecular mechanisms involved 
both in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome, based on 
innovative metabolites that consistently change in nascent metabolic syndrome, 
drug-naïve, first episode psychosis and/or schizophrenic patients compared to 
healthy subjects. Main Lines: Supported by metabolomic approaches, although not 
exclusively, noteworthy variations are reported mainly through serum samples of 
patients and controls in several scenes: 1) alterations in fatty acids, 
inflammatory response indicators, amino acids and biogenic amines, biometals, 
and gut microbiota metabolites (schizophrenia); 2) alterations in metabolites 
involved in carbohydrate and gut microbiota metabolism, inflammation and 
oxidative stress (metabolic syndrome), some of them shared with schizophrenia; 
3) alterations of cytokines secreted by adipose tissue, phosphatidylcholines, 
acylcarnitines, Sirtuin 1, orexin-A, and changes in microbiota composition 
(antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome).
CONCLUSION: Novel insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and metabolic 
side-effects associated with its antipsychotic treatment represent an urgent 
request for scientists and clinicians. Leptin, carnitines, adiponectin, insulin, 
or interleukin-6 represent some examples of candidate biomarkers. Cutting-edge 
technologies like metabolomics have the power to strengthen research for 
achieving preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutical solutions for schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: Typical features differentiate COVID-19-associated lung injury from 
acute respiratory distress syndrome. The clinical role of chest computed 
tomography (CT) in describing the progression of COVID-19-associated lung injury 
remains to be clarified. We investigated in COVID-19 patients the regional 
distribution of lung injury and the influence of clinical and laboratory 
features on its progression.
METHODS: This was a prospective study. For each CT, twenty images, evenly spaced 
along the cranio-caudal axis, were selected. For regional analysis, each CT 
image was divided into three concentric subpleural regions of interest and four 
quadrants. Hyper-, normally, hypo- and non-inflated lung compartments were 
defined. Nonparametric tests were used for hypothesis testing (α = 0.05). 
Spearman correlation test was used to detect correlations between lung 
compartments and clinical features.
RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 111 recruited patients were eligible for further 
analysis. Five hundred-sixty CT images were analyzed. Lung injury, composed by 
hypo- and non-inflated areas, was significantly more represented in subpleural 
than in core lung regions. A secondary, centripetal spread of lung injury was 
associated with exposure to mechanical ventilation (p < 0.04), longer 
spontaneous breathing (more than 14 days, p < 0.05) and non-protective tidal 
volume (p < 0.04). Positive fluid balance (p < 0.01), high plasma D-dimers 
(p < 0.01) and ferritin (p < 0.04) were associated with increased lung injury.
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure, a 
predominant subpleural distribution of lung injury is observed. Prolonged 
spontaneous breathing and high tidal volumes, both causes of patient 
self-induced lung injury, are associated to an extensive involvement of more 
central regions. Positive fluid balance, inflammation and thrombosis are 
associated with lung injury. Trial registration Study registered a priori the 
20th of March, 2020. Clinical Trials ID NCT04316884.

PURPOSE: Clinical node-positive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (cN+UCaB) is 
a rapidly fatal disease with limited information on comparative-effectiveness of 
available treatment options. We sought to examine the impact of high-intensity 
vs. conservative local treatment (LT) regimens in management of these patients 
alongside systemic chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 3,227 patients within the National Cancer 
Data Base who underwent multiagent systemic chemotherapy along with either 
high-intensity or conservative LT for primary cN+UCaB between 2004-2016. 
Patients who received no LT, TURBT alone, or <50 Gy radiation therapy to the 
bladder were included in the conservative group, while patients that received 
radical cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy or ≥50 Gy radiation therapy with 
TURBT were included in the high-intensity group. Inverse probability of 
treatment weighting (IPTW) adjusted Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses 
were used to assess overall survival (OS). Additionally, to assess whether the 
benefit of high-intensity LT differs by baseline mortality risk, we tested an 
interaction between 5-year predicted life-expectancy and the LT type.
RESULTS: Overall, 784 (24.3%) and 2,443 (75.7%) cN+UCaB patients underwent 
high-intensity and conservative LT, respectively. IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier 
analysis demonstrated OS to be significantly higher in the high-intensity group 
compared to the conservative group: 5-year OS 28.4% vs. 18.3%, respectively 
(Log-rank P<0.001). IPTW-adjusted multivariable Cox regression analysis 
confirmed the benefit of high-intensity LT in prolonging OS (HR 0.63, P<0.001). 
Interaction analysis showed that high-intensity LT approach was associated with 
longer OS in all patients regardless of their baseline 5-year life-expectancy 
(Pinteraction=0.79).
CONCLUSION: Eligible patients with cN+UCaB should be considered for aggressive 
local treatment alongside multiagent systemic chemotherapy. Prospective trials 
are needed to validate these preliminary findings.

Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapies prolong life expectancy and improve the 
quality of life of HIV-infected patients. Despite the documented benefits of 
antiretroviral drugs, its use is not without side effects. Here, we report cases 
of new onset diabetes mellitus after taking a dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART 
regimen.
CASE PRESENTATION: HIV-infected patients who had been on non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART regimens for more than a decade were 
shifted to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (dolutegravir)-based ART regimen 
as recommended by the National Comprehensive HIV Care Guideline. They were 
diagnosed to have diabetes mellitus with or without diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) 
as evidenced by polyuria, polydipsia and fatigue, severe hyperglycemia (plasma 
glucose level >250 mg/dl) with or without ketonuria (3+) after 1-12 months of 
DTG-based ART regimen. Two of the patients who presented with DKA were treated 
with intravenous fluids and regular insulin. NPH insulin was started following 
recovery from DKA, which later shifted to metformin. One of the patients who 
presented with severe hyperglycemia without DKA was started with NPH insulin, 
which later shifted to metformin. Good glycemic control was obtained with 
metformin, while the DTG-based ART regimen was continued.
CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia is a potential and noticed side effect of the 
DTG-based ART regimen. Baseline and periodic monitoring of plasma glucose might 
be required in ART regimens containing dolutegravir.

BACKGROUND: Policy makers aiming to reduce micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) and 
their health effects must choose among alternative definitions of impact when 
evaluating cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: Estimate the cost-effectiveness of a mandatory wheat flour 
fortification program for reducing cases of MNDs (iron, zinc, folate, vitamin 
B12), anemia and neural tube defects (NTDs) averted, and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) averted in urban Cameroon.
METHODS: A 13-year predictive model was developed, including a 3-year start-up 
period and 10 years of program activity. Costs were estimated using historical 
program budgets. Effects were calculated based on observed changes in prevalence 
of MND and anemia 1 year postfortification and predicted reductions in NTDs 
based on NTD burden and wheat flour intake. Total DALYs averted were estimated 
for anemia and NTDs.
RESULTS: The program cost ∼$2.4 million over 13 years and averted an estimated 
∼95 000 cases of maternal anemia and ∼83 500 cases of iron deficiency among 
children after 1 year. Cost/case-year averted for MNDs ranged from $0.50 for low 
plasma folate to $3.30 for iron deficiency and was $2.20 for maternal anemia. 
The program was predicted to avert 1600 cases of NTDs over 10 years at ∼$1500 
per case averted. Estimated cost/DALY averted was $50 for NTDs and $115 for 
anemia.
CONCLUSIONS: In Cameroon, cost-effectiveness of wheat flour fortification varied 
by the measure of impact employed, but was classified as "very cost-effective" 
for all outcomes using World Health Organization criteria. Policy makers and 
their advisors must determine how best to use information on program costs and 
benefits to inform their decisions.
