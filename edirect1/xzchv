recur. Either early or late adjuvant radiotherapy is highly efficacious in 
controlling recurrent NFPA but associates potentially burdensome complications 
like hypopituitarism, vascular complications or secondary neoplasm. Reoperation 
is indicated in bulky tumor rests compressing the optic pathway. To date, no 
standardized medical therapy is available for recurrent NFPA although 
cabergoline and temozolomide show promising results. Guidelines on the 
management of recurrent NFPAs are now available. The new 2017 WHO pituitary 
tumor classification, based on immunohistochemistry and transcription factor 
assessment, identifies a group of aggressive NFPA variants that may benefit from 
earlier adjuvant therapy. Nevertheless, NFPA patients exhibit a reduced overall 
life expectancy largely due to hypopituitarism and treatment-related morbidity. 
The management of recurrent NFPA benefits from a multidisciplinary teamwork of 
surgeons, endocrinologists, radiation oncologists, ophthalmologists, 
pathologists and neuro-radiologists in order to provide individualized therapy 
and anticipate deterioration.

OBJECTIVE: To report on the cost-effectiveness of BRECONDA (Breast 
RECONstruction Decision Aid), a web-based decision aid to facilitate decisions 
regarding breast reconstruction surgery, with usual care for women with breast 
cancer.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized controlled 
trial. Women diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ and 
eligible for breast reconstruction following mastectomy were randomized to 
access BRECONDA for 6 months + usual care (n = 106) or usual care (n = 116) and 
were assessed at baseline preintervention, and then 1-month and 6-months 
post-randomization. Decisional conflict, satisfaction with information, 
decisional regret, and utilities were assessed by using maximum-likelihood 
linear mixed effects models. Costs included the fixed costs of BRECONDA, health 
care provider time, and health care resource use. Nonparametric bootstrapping 
was used to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: BRECONDA resulted in significantly less decisional conflict and greater 
satisfaction with information over time. Quality-adjusted life years did not 
differ between participants who received the decision aid compared with usual 
care. The cost of BRECONDA was estimated to be small (AUD$10) relative to other 
health care interventions and resulted in decreased health care costs overall 
(AUD$764). Based on the point estimates, the decision aid was more effective and 
less costly (dominant) for all measures of effectiveness. It was estimated that 
the decision aid has an 87% probability of being cost-effective at $60 000 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The BRECONDA web-based intervention designed to facilitate 
decisions regarding breast reconstruction surgery is likely to be cost-effective 
compared with usual care for women with breast cancer.

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with a reduced life expectancy. The latest 
published evidence suggests an increased risk of fractures among T2DM patients. 
We conducted a population-based cohort study to determine the impact of 
mortality as a competing risk in the study of the association between T2DM and 
hip fracture rates. Participants were all diagnosed T2DM patients registered in 
the Sistema de Información para el Desarrollo de la Investigación en Atención 
Primaria (SIDIAP) database aged 65 years and older; up to two non-T2DM were 
matched by age, sex, and primary care facility. We used Cox regression models to 
estimate cause-specific hazard ratio (HR) of death or hip fracture according to 
T2DM status. Fine and Gray models were then fitted to estimate the subhazard 
ratio (SHR) of hip fracture while accounting for competing risk with death and 
to estimate the probability of hip fracture within 5 years. A total of 55,891 
T2DM and 103,093 matched non-T2DM patients were observed for a median of 8 
years. Mortality was 48.8 per 1000 person years (py) in T2DM, and 33.8 per 1000 
py in non-T2DM; hip fracture rates were 6.0 per 1000 py and 4.9 per 1000 py, 
respectively. Cox models confirmed a significant association for death and hip 
fracture: HR 1.51 (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.55), and HR 1.32 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.40), 
respectively. Accounting for death as a competing event (Fine-Gray models), the 
association between T2DM and hip fracture risk remained statistically 
significant (SHR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.21) and the probability of a hip 
fracture within 5 years was 2.3% for TD2M and 1.9% for non-TD2M patients 
compared to 2.6% and 2.1% respectively using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates. T2DM 
patients have a 50% increased mortality and, after adjusting for differential 
survival at 5 years, a 21% increased incidence of hip fracture when compared to 
matched non-T2DM. Failing to account for differential mortality leads to an 
overestimation of fracture risk. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral

BACKGROUND: Meaning-centered group psychotherapy for cancer survivors (MCGP-CS) 
improves meaning, psychological well-being, and mental adjustment to cancer and 
reduces psychological distress. This randomized controlled trial was conducted 
to investigate the cost-utility of MCGP-CS compared with supportive group 
psychotherapy (SGP) and care-as-usual (CAU).
METHODS: In total, 170 patients were randomized to MCGP-CS, SGP, or CAU. 
Intervention costs, direct medical and nonmedical costs, productivity losses, 
and health-related quality of life were measured until 6 months follow-up, using 
the TIC-P, PRODISQ, data from the hospital information system, and the EQ-5D. 
The cost-utility was calculated by comparing mean cumulative costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Mean total costs ranged from €4492 (MCGP-CS) to €5304 (CAU). Mean QALYs 
ranged .507 (CAU) to .540 (MCGP-CS). MCGP-CS had a probability of 74% to be both 
less costly and more effective than CAU, and 49% compared with SGP. Sensitivity 
analyses showed these findings are robust. If society is willing to pay €0 for 
one gained QALY, MCGP-CS has a 78% probability of being cost-effective compared 
with CAU. This increases to 85% and 92% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of 
€10 000 and €30 000, which are commonly accepted thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: MCGP-CS is highly likely a cost-effective intervention, meaning 
that there is a positive balance between the costs and gains of MCGP-CS, in 
comparison with SGP and CAU.

The science and engineering of biomaterials have improved the human life 
expectancy. Tissue engineering is one of the nascent strategies with an aim to 
fulfill this target. Tissue engineering scaffolds are one of the most 
significant aspects of the recent tissue repair strategies; hence, it is 
imperative to design biomimetic substrates with suitable features. Conductive 
substrates can ameliorate the cellular activity through enhancement of cellular 
signaling. Biocompatible polymers with conductivity can mimic the cells' niche 
in an appropriate manner. Bioconductive polymers based on aniline oligomers can 
potentially actualize this purpose because of their unique and tailoring 
properties. The aniline oligomers can be positioned within the molecular 
structure of other polymers, thus painter acting with the side groups of the 
main polymer or acting as a comonomer in their backbone. The conductivity of 
oligoaniline-based conductive biomaterials can be tailored to mimic the 
electrical and mechanical properties of targeted tissues/organs. These 
bioconductive substrates can be designed with high mechanical strength for hard 
tissues such as the bone and with high elasticity to be used for the cardiac 
tissue or can be synthesized in the form of injectable hydrogels, particles, and 
nanofibers for noninvasive implantation; these structures can be used for 
applications such as drug/gene delivery and extracellular biomimetic structures. 
It is expected that with progress in the fields of biomaterials and tissue 
engineering, more innovative constructs will be proposed in the near future. 
This review discusses the recent advancements in the use of oligoaniline-based 
conductive biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 
applications.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The tissue engineering applications of aniline 
oligomers and their derivatives have recently attracted an increasing interest 
due to their electroactive and biodegradable properties. However, no reports 
have systematically reviewed the critical role of oligoaniline-based conductive 
biomaterials in tissue engineering. Research on aniline oligomers is growing 
today opening new scenarios that expand the potential of these biomaterials from 
"traditional" treatments to a new era of tissue engineering. The conductivity of 
this class of biomaterials can be tailored similar to that of tissues/organs. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first review article in which such issue 
is systematically reviewed and critically discussed in the light of the existing 
literature. Undoubtedly, investigations on the use of oligoaniline-based 
conductive biomaterials in tissue engineering need further advancement and a lot 
of critical questions are yet to be answered. In this review, we introduce the 
salient features, the hurdles that must be overcome, the hopes, and practical 
constraints for further development.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of endobronchial coils on health-related 
quality-of-life (HRQoL). This paper utilizes trial data to identify the 
predictors of HRQoL in patients with severe emphysema, and subsequently 
estimates the impact of a new treatment on HRQoL (measured by utilities). These 
utility estimates are used to generate indicative long-term QALY estimates for a 
range of clinically plausible scenarios as a precursor to cost-effectiveness 
analyses.
METHODS: Patient level HRQoL data from RENEW and the National Emphysema 
Treatment Trial (NETT) were combined and mapped to generic EuroQol 5-dimension 
health utility questionnaire (EQ-5D) values using a published algorithm. 
Multilevel statistical models were developed using treatment, time, response, 
and baseline characteristics (EQ-5D, age, gender, FEV1, lung RV) to predict 
EQ-5D over time. Lifetime QALY estimates were generated using published survival 
data from NETT (assuming no impact of treatment on mortality) and four 
clinically plausible response profiles. Each response profile was combined with 
assumptions around treatment impact (constant or time varying).
RESULTS: After controlling for baseline characteristics, both treatment and 
response had a statistically significant impact (p < .001) on utility (+0.101 
and +0.061, respectively). When combined with selected baseline characteristics 
and time, Coils and Standard of Care (SoC) generated more QALYs than SoC alone 
in all scenarios, with incremental lifetime benefit ranging from 0.29-0.55 
QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Coils and SoC resulted in statistically significant improvements in 
HRQoL compared to SoC alone in patients with severe emphysema.

Although traditional epidemiological information, such as mortality rate and 
prevalence or incidence rates, is relevant to the understanding of AIDS 
epidemiology in Brazil, a more complete indicator would be recommended. The aim 
of this study was to estimate the burden of AIDS and its trends in Brazil from 
1980 to 2015. An ecological study using secondary data on mortality, morbidity 
and demography was carried out. Data were collected from official health 
information sources. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) index was estimated 
by year. Trend analysis of the rates were performed using a segmented linear 
regression method. There were 826,452 confirmed HIV/AIDS cases and 302,614 
deaths from AIDS-related causes in the studied period. The greatest burden 
occurred between 1994 and 1996, with a significant increase in the burden of 
AIDS for both sexes. The burden of AIDS in Brazil remains high, with a tendency 
to increase significantly the DALY rates in the study period. However, trend 
reversals in the DALY rates and in the mortality component, with a consequent 
increase in the morbidity component, were identified from 1995 onwards.

Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a progressive and life limiting autosomal recessive 
disorder caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Mutations in these 
genes are associated with abnormal endosomal-lysosomal trafficking, resulting in 
the accumulation of multiple tissue specific lipids in the lysosomes. The 
clinical spectrum of NPC disease ranges from a neonatal rapidly progressive 
fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. The age of 
onset of the first (beyond 3 months of life) neurological symptom may predict 
the severity of the disease and determines life expectancy.NPC has an estimated 
incidence of ~ 1: 100,000 and the rarity of the disease translate into 
misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and barriers to good care. For these reasons, we 
have developed clinical guidelines that define standard of care for NPC 
patients, foster shared care arrangements between expert centres and family 
physicians, and empower patients. The information contained in these guidelines 
was obtained through a systematic review of the literature and the experiences 
of the authors in their care of patients with NPC. We adopted the Appraisal of 
Guidelines for Research & Evaluation (AGREE II) system as method of choice for 
the guideline development process. We made a series of conclusive statements and 
scored them according to level of evidence, strengths of recommendations and 
expert opinions. These guidelines can inform care providers, care funders, 
patients and their carers of best practice of care for patients with NPC. In 
addition, these guidelines have identified gaps in the knowledge that must be 
filled by future research. It is anticipated that the implementation of these 
guidelines will lead to a step change in the quality of care for patients with 
NPC irrespective of their geographical location.

BACKGROUND: The equine m. gluteus medius (GM) is the largest muscle of the 
horse, its main movement function is the extension of the hip joint. The 
objective of the present study was to measure equine GM activity in three 
adjacent locations on GM during walk and trot on a treadmill, in order to 
document potential differences. Fourteen Haflinger mares were measured using 
surface electromyography and kinematic markers to identify the motion cycles on 
three occasions over 16 weeks. The electrodes were placed on left and right 
gluteus medius muscle over the middle of its widest part and 5 cm lateral and 
medial of it. For data processing, electrical activity was normalised to its 
maximum value and timing was normalised to the motion cycle. A Gaussian 
distribution approach was used to determine up to 10 modes of focussed activity, 
and results were analysed separately for stance and swing phase of the 
ipsilateral hindlimb.
RESULTS: Fair reliability was found for mean mode values (Cronbach's 
alpha = 0.66) and good reliability was found for mean mode locations (Cronbach's 
alpha = 0.71) over the three data collection days. The magnitude of muscle 
activity identified as mean mode value was much larger at trot than at walk, and 
mean mode value was significantly different between stance phases of walk and 
trot for all electrode positions (p < 0.01). The pattern of muscle activity 
identified as mean mode location was significantly different for walk and trot 
at all electrode positions, both during stance and swing phases (p < 0.001). 
This indicates the different timing pattern between the gaits. Results of the 
three electrode positions on the same muscle during each gait were not 
significantly different when comparing the same measurement.
CONCLUSIONS: The middle of the equine GM does not show any indication of 
functional differentiation during walk and trot on a treadmill; this might be 
due to lack of segmentation as such, or due to lack of need for segmented use 
for these very basic main tasks of the muscle. The reliability of the sEMG 
measurements over several weeks was fair to good, an indication for the 
robustness of the methodology.

PURPOSE: To revise the recommendation on the use of concurrent chemotherapy (CC) 
with palliative thoracic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) made in the 
original 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology guideline on palliative 
thoracic radiation for lung cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Based on a systematic PubMed search showing new evidence 
for this key question, the task force felt an update was merited. Guideline 
recommendations were created using a predefined consensus-building methodology 
supported by American Society for Radiation Oncology-approved tools for grading 
evidence quality and recommendation strength.
RESULTS: Although few randomized clinical trials address the question of CC 
combined with palliative thoracic EBRT for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a 
strong consensus was reached among the task force on recommendations for 
incurable stage III and IV NSCLC. For patients with stage III NSCLC deemed 
unsuitable for curative therapy but who are (1) candidates for chemotherapy, (2) 
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS of 0 to 2, and (3) have a life 
expectancy of at least 3 months, administration of a platinum-containing 
chemotherapy doublet concurrently with moderately hypofractionated palliative 
thoracic radiation therapy is recommended over treatment with either modality 
alone. For patients with stage IV NSCLC, routine use of concurrent thoracic 
chemoradiation is not recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal palliation of patients with incurable NSCLC requires 
coordinated interdisciplinary care. Recent data establish a rationale for CC 
with palliative thoracic EBRT for a well-defined subset of patients with 
incurable stage III NSCLC. For all other patients with incurable NSCLC, data 
remain insufficient to support this treatment approach.

BACKGROUND: The Dutch Ministry of Health has formulated ambitious goals 
concerning the use of telehealth, leading to subsequent changes compared with 
the current health care situation, in which 93% of care is delivered 
face-to-face. Since most care is delivered to older people, the prospect of 
telehealth raises the question of whether this population is ready for this new 
way of receiving care. To study this, we created a theoretical framework 
consisting of 6 factors associated with older people's intention to use 
technology.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand community-dwelling 
older people's readiness for receiving telehealth by studying their intention to 
use videoconferencing and capacities for using digital technology in daily life 
as indicators.
METHODS: A mixed-method triangulation design was used. First, a cross-sectional 
survey study was performed to investigate older people's intention to use 
videoconferencing, by testing our theoretical framework with a multilevel path 
analysis (phase 1). Second, for deeper understanding of older people's actual 
use of digital technology, qualitative observations of older people executing 
technological tasks (eg, on a computer, cell phone) were conducted at their 
homes (phase 2).
RESULTS: In phase 1, a total of 256 people aged 65 years or older participated 
in the survey study (50.0% male; median age, 70 years; Q1-Q3: 67-76). Using a 
significance level of .05, we found seven significant associations regarding 
older people's perception of videoconferencing. Older people's (1) intention to 
use videoconferencing was predicted by their performance expectancy (odds ratio 
[OR] 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.39), effort expectancy (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.39), and 
perceived privacy and security (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.17-1.43); (2) their 
performance expectancy was predicted by their effort expectancy (OR 1.38, 95% CI 
1.24-1.52); and (3) their effort expectancy was predicted by their self-efficacy 
(OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.42-1.68). In phase 2, a total of 6 men and 9 women aged 
between 65 and 87 years participated in the qualitative observation study. Of 
the primary themes, 5 themes were identified that could provide greater 
understanding of older people's capacities and incapacities in using digital 
technology: (1) "self-efficacy and digital literacy," (2) "obstacles to using 
technology," (3) "prior experience and frequency of use," (4) "sources of 
support and facilitating conditions," and (5) "performance expectancy." These 5 
themes recurred in all 15 observations.
CONCLUSIONS: Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived privacy 
and security are direct predictors of older people's intention to use 
videoconferencing. Self-efficacy appeared to play a role in both older people's 
intention to use, as well as their actual use of technology. The path analysis 
revealed that self-efficacy was significantly associated with older people's 
effort expectancy. Furthermore, self-efficacy and digital literacy appeared to 
play a major role in older people's capacities to make use of digital 
technology.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preventive ceftriaxone vs 
standard stroke unit care without preventive antimicrobial therapy in acute 
stroke patients.
METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label trial with masked endpoint 
assessment, 2,550 patients with acute stroke were included between 2010 and 
2014. Economic evaluation was performed from a societal perspective with a time 
horizon of 3 months. Volumes and costs of direct, indirect, medical, and 
nonmedical care were assessed. Primary outcome was cost per unit of the modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS) and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 2,538 patients were available for the intention-to-treat 
analysis. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, 2,538 patients were available for 
in-hospital resource use and 1,453 for other resource use. Use of institutional 
care resources, out-of-pocket expenses, and productivity losses was comparable 
between treatment groups. The mean score on mRS was 2.38 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 2.31-2.44) vs 2.44 (95% CI 2.37-2.51) in the ceftriaxone vs 
control group, the decrease by 0.06 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.16) in favor of 
ceftriaxone treatment being nonsignificant. However, the number of QALYs was 
0.163 (95% CI 0.159-0.166) vs 0.155 (95% CI 0.152-0.158) in the ceftriaxone vs 
control group, with the difference of 0.008 (95% CI 0.003-0.012) in favor of 
ceftriaxone (p = 0.006) at 3 months. The probability of ceftriaxone being 
cost-effective ranged between 0.67 and 0.89. Probability of 0.75 was attained at 
a willing-to-pay level of €2,290 per unit decrease in the mRS score and of 
€12,200 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventive ceftriaxone has a probability of 0.7 of being less 
costly than standard treatment per unit decrease in mRS and per QALY gained.

Birth weight predicts aging trajectory: A hypothesis.

Increasing evidence suggests that risk for age-related disease and longevity can 
be programmed early in life. In human populations, convincing evidence has been 
accumulated indicating that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) resulting in 
low birth weight (<2.5 kg) followed by postnatal catch-up growth is associated 
with various aspects of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease in adulthood. Fetal macrosomia (birth weight > 4.5 kg), by contrast, is 
associated with high risk of non-diabetic obesity and cancers in later life. 
Developmental modification of epigenetic patterns is considered to be a central 
mechanism in determining such developmentally programmed phenotypes. Growth 
hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis is likely a key driver of these 
processes. In this review, evidence is discussed that suggests that different 
aging trajectories can be realized depending on developmentally programmed 
life-course dynamics of IGF-1. In this hypothetical scenario, IUGR-induced 
deficit of IGF-1 causes "diabetic" aging trajectory associated with various 
metabolic disorders in adulthood, while fetal macrosomia-induced excessive 
levels of IGF-1 lead to "cancerous" aging trajectory. If the above reasoning is 
correct, then both low and high birth weights are predictors of short life 
expectancy, while the normal birth weight is a predictor of "normal" aging and 
maximum longevity.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin pumps and Dose 
Adjustment for Normal Eating (pumps+DAFNE) compared with multiple daily insulin 
injections and DAFNE (MDI+DAFNE) for adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 
in the UK.
METHODS: We undertook a cost-utility analysis using the Sheffield Type 1 
Diabetes Policy Model and data from the Relative Effectiveness of Pumps over 
Structured Education (REPOSE) trial to estimate the lifetime incidence of 
diabetic complications, intervention-based resource use and associated effects 
on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). All economic analyses took a 
National Health Service and personal social services perspective and discounted 
costs and QALYs at 3.5% per annum. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
performed on the base case. Further uncertainties in the cost of pumps and the 
evidence used to inform the model were explored using scenario analyses.
SETTING: Eight diabetes centres in England and Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with T1DM who were eligible to receive a structured 
education course and did not have a strong clinical indication or a preference 
for a pump.
INTERVENTION: Pumps+DAFNE.
COMPARATOR: MDI+DAFNE.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs, incremental QALYs gained and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Compared with MDI+DAFNE, pumps+DAFNE was associated with an incremental 
discounted lifetime cost of +£18 853 (95% CI £6175 to £31 645) and a gain in 
discounted lifetime QALYs of +0.13 (95% CI -0.70 to +0.96). The base case mean 
ICER was £142 195 per QALY gained. The probability of pump+DAFNE being 
cost-effective using a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained 
was 14.0%. All scenario and subgroup analyses examined indicated that the ICER 
was unlikely to fall below £30 000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the REPOSE data suggests that routine use of pumps 
in adults without an immediate clinical need for a pump, as identified by 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, would not be cost-effective.

With the epidemiological transition, causes of death shifted from communicable 
to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and life expectancy increased, as these NCD 
deaths occurred later in life. However, in the United States, over the past 
years, life expectancy has been stagnating or decreasing despite decreasing NCD 
mortality rates. Analyses of the most important underlying causes of death with 
increasing premature mortality reveal that psychoactive substance use played a 
crucial role for these increases. Furthermore, it can be shown, that a high 
proportion of the increased premature mortality and decreased life expectancies 
happened in lower socio-economic strata. Substance use policies should thus 
focus on lowering the gap between substance-attributable mortality in higher 
versus lower socioeconomic strata.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hypothermic circulatory arrest carries a high risk of 
mortality and neurological complications. An important part of assessing 
surgical treatment is the evaluation of long-term survival and postoperative 
health-related quality of life.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 30 patients undergoing 
hypothermic circulatory arrest during surgery of the thoracic aorta, and 31 
comparison patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery without 
hypothermic circulatory arrest were evaluated for long-term survival and 
health-related quality of life, using the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 
questionnaire. The results were compared to national age- and sex-matched 
reference populations of the chronically ill and healthy adults.
RESULTS: After 4.6-8.0 years, available study (88%) and comparison (59%) 
patients were interviewed. The life expectancy was similar with 4- and 8-year 
survival of 90%, and 87% for the study group, and 94%, and 94% for the 
comparison group, respectively (log rank test, p = 0.62). The RAND-36 scores for 
study and comparison groups were congruent in all dimensions, describing 
physical, mental, and social domains. The study patients' health-related quality 
of life results were similar to the national reference population with chronic 
illnesses.
CONCLUSION: After hypothermic circulatory arrest, patients undergoing surgery of 
the thoracic aorta achieve a similar long-term life expectancy and 
health-related quality of life as do patients undergoing coronary surgery 
without hypothermic circulatory arrest, and a health-related quality of life 
similar to the national reference population with chronic illnesses. These 
results justify operative treatment in this high-risk patient population.

Increased life expectancy has had a corresponding socioeconomic impact due to 
the ageing population and, among other issues, has increased the incidence of 
diseases related to cognitive impairment, such as dementia. These changes 
particularly affect the most developed countries. Any analysis of economic costs 
aiming to study patients with health problems related to cognitive impairment or 
dementia should consider the reality of the distinct phases of these disorders 
and should be conducted from the perspective of the payer, that is, the 
publicly-funded healthcare system. Moreover, given the complexity and importance 
of cognitive impairment, there is a need to consider both direct healthcare 
costs, such as hospitalization measures, medication for the treatment of these 
diseases, specialist consultations, transport (eg, ambulances in severe cases), 
and direct non-healthcare costs (eg, professional care, nonprofessional care). 
In addition, indirect costs (related to productivity losses such as sick leave) 
must be considered for these diseases. Lastly, in 2014, the annual total mean 
cost (direct and indirect costs) in Spain for each patient with cognitive 
impairment, dementia and Alzheimer disease, was around €30 000. A large part of 
this economic burden was due especially to indirect costs, which are usually a 
borne by affected individuals and their families.
