METHODS: We modeled a hypothetical cohort of people with clinically significant 
incident keratoconus as defined by the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of 
Keratoconus (CLEK) Study. We included costs of clinic visits, fitting fees, 
contact lenses, surgical procedures, and complications. Survival curves of 
corneal transplants and associated complications were modeled using data from 
the 2007 Australian Graft Registry. Medical treatment regimens after surgery 
were defined by expert opinion.
RESULTS: The expected value of the lifetime cost of the treatment of keratoconus 
over myopia was $25 168 with a standard deviation of $16 247 and a median of $17 
596. The factors that most influenced the lifetime cost were the probability of 
initial corneal transplant and a subsequent regraft. The cost of routine care 
had relatively little influence on the lifetime cost of care.
CONCLUSIONS: The expected lifetime cost of treatment of keratoconus represents a 
significant cost to patients and payors. While the cost of routine care for 
keratoconus is not trivial, the primary factor influencing changes in the cost 
of care for keratoconus is the probability of corneal transplant. Combined with 
the significantly impaired vision-related quality of life and the relatively 
young onset of disease, the economic burden of the treatment of keratoconus 
represents a significant public health concern.

University, Australia. emily.lancsar@monash.edu

This paper presents the first attempt to use a discrete choice experiment to 
derive distributional weights for quality adjusted life years (QALYs), based on 
characteristics (age and severity) of the beneficiaries. A novel approach using 
the Hicksian compensating variation is applied. Advantages include derivation of 
weights for QALYs, not just for life or life years saved, and investigation of 
the impact of the size of the health gain by allowing the gain to be traded 
against other characteristics. Results suggest one would generally not weight 
QALYs, except in a small number of specific cases and in those cases the weights 
are relatively small. Methodological challenges are highlighted as is a future 
research agenda.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of renal replacement therapy in Austria.

Haller M(1), Gutjahr G, Kramar R, Harnoncourt F, Oberbauer R.

BACKGROUND: Providing renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal 
disease patients is resource intensive. Despite growing financial pressure in 
health care systems worldwide, cost-effectiveness studies of RRT modalities are 
scarce.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model of costs, quality of life and survival to 
compare three different assignment strategies to chronic RRT in Europe.
RESULTS: Mean annual treatment costs for haemodialysis were €43,600 during the 
first 12 months, €40,000 between 13 and 24 months and €40,600 beyond 25 months 
after initiation of treatment. Mean annual treatment costs for peritoneal 
dialysis were €25,900 during the first 12 months, €15,300 between 13 and 24 
months and €20,500 beyond 25 months. Mean annual therapy costs for a kidney 
transplantation during the first 12 months were €50,900 from a living donor, 
€51,000 from a deceased donor, €17,200 between 13 and 24 months and €12,900 
beyond 25 months after engraftment. Over the next 10 years in Austria with a 
population of 8 million people, increased assignment to peritoneal dialysis of 
20% incident patients saved €26 million with a discount rate of 3% and gained 
839 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); additionally, increasing renal 
transplants to 10% from live donations saved €38 million discounted and gained 
2242 QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Live donor renal transplantation is cost effective and associated 
with increase in QALYs. Therefore, preemptive live kidney transplantation should 
be promoted from a fiscal as well as medical point of view.

Can life expectancy and QALYs be improved by a framework for deciding whether to 
apply clinical guidelines to patients with severe comorbid disease?

Braithwaite RS(1).

Author information:
(1)Section of Value and Comparative Effectiveness, Division of General Internal 
Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York (RSB)

BACKGROUND: Guidelines with short-term harms and long-term benefits are often 
applied to chronically ill patients who may not benefit. The payoff time 
framework has been proposed (i.e., do not apply a guideline if a patient's life 
expectancy (LE) is shorter than when a guideline's cumulative incremental 
benefits first exceed its cumulative incremental harms), but its health impact 
is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the payoff time framework improves LE and/or 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for chronically ill patients.
METHODS: I evaluate impact of the payoff time framework on LE and QALYs, 
assuming (1) high and constant background mortality rate from chronic illness (≥ 
10% per year), (2) immediate guideline-related harm with probability < 1, and 
(3) constant guideline-related benefit that occurs over an extended time. I 
apply the framework to questions of whether to screen chronically ill 
50-year-old women for colorectal cancer using colonoscopy, and whether to 
advocate intensive glucose control for chronically ill diabetics.
RESULTS: If a guideline's payoff time is greater than a patient's LE, then 
withholding that guideline will increase LE and QALYs for that patient. For a 
50-year-old chronically ill woman with background mortality > 0.15 per year 
(corresponding to LE < 6.5 years), withholding CR screening will increase LE. 
For a diabetic with background mortality > 0.11 per year (corresponding to LE < 
9.4 years), withholding CR screening will increase QALYs.
CONCLUSION: The payoff time framework may indicate when withholding a guideline 
with short-term harms and long-term benefits may increase LE and/or QALY.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The life expectancy of patients with sickle cell anemia 
(SCA) has improved with modern medical care, and this has led to frequent 
observation of various chronic complications of the disease including 
abnormalities in renal function. Proteinuria is not only a marker of renal 
disease but is also a predictor of disease progression. This screening study was 
aimed at evaluating the prevalence of proteinuria among adult SCA patients in 
Kano, Nigeria, which has not been reported previously.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 200 adult SCA patients were studied. They 
consisted of 100 men and 100 women. Blood was collected for the assay of serum 
urea, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and creatinine and estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula. Urine dipstick test for the presence of proteinuria and other 
abnormalities was done, and 24-hour urine protein was measured in those with 
significant proteinuria.
RESULTS: Mean age of the male patients was 25.1 ± 1.0 years, whereas the mean 
age of the female patients was 22.8 ± 4.2 years. Twenty eight percent (32 males, 
24 females) of the subjects were observed to have significant proteinuria. The 
mean estimated eGFR of the males was 88 ± 19.6 ml/min while that of the females 
was 92 ± 10.2 ml/min. The male SCA patients with proteinuria had a mean eGFR of 
70 ± 6.9 ml/min, whereas the female SCA patients with proteinuria had mean eGFR 
of 101 ± 2.5 ml/min. Among the male patients with proteinuria, 50% had chronic 
kidney disease (CKD).
CONCLUSION: Proteinuria which is a marker of renal insufficiency is common among 
adult SCA patients, and routine screening for proteinuria may help detect those 
at increased risk of renal disease. CKD prevalence is high among SCA patients 
with significant proteinuria.

Embrace: addressing anticipatory grief and bereavement in the perinatal 
population: a palliative care case study.

57117, USA.

Anticipatory grief is experienced by families who are informed that their unborn 
child may not survive in utero or during or after delivery. The child who 
survives delivery, but is critically ill, brings a combination of emotions to 
the family: joy in welcoming a new life and fear for the future. The healthcare 
team members caring for the patient and family often witness this grief and are 
impacted. In the perinatal setting, the care continuum for these patients begins 
at diagnosis, typically in the prenatal setting, and continued support extends 
beyond the presumed life expectancy of the child. This case study is provided to 
demonstrate the utilization of a palliative care interdisciplinary approach to 
meeting the complex bereavement needs of a family who was expecting a child with 
a life-impacting congenital condition.

Treatment outcome of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients aged 70 
years and older.

Author information:
(1)Jefferson Medical College, Department of Neurological Surgery, Thomas 
Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is increasing, especially 
in the elderly as life expectancy increases. Aggressive treatment of aneurysms 
in the elderly is usually avoided because of a presumed poor prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of treatment in 
patients older than 70 years old.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 150 patients aged 70 years 
and older who were treated at Jefferson Hospital from 2004 to 2009. Data 
including World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grade and Hunt and Hess 
classification, specific management components, and treatment outcome on 
discharge were analyzed.
RESULTS: One hundred ten patients had aneurysms coiled, 9 patients had aneurysms 
clipped, 11 patients had aneurysms that were not treated, and 20 patients had no 
visible aneurysms. Overall, increased World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 
grades correlated strongly with poor clinical outcome. Statistical tests 
indicate that patients who died (mean, 78.8, n=35) or who went into 
rehabilitation (mean, 76.5, n=81) were significantly older than patients who 
were discharged home (mean, 73.1, n=20). However, day of presentation after 
initial symptom(s) of subarachnoid hemorrhage and placement of 
ventriculoperitoneal shunt also influenced clinical outcome. Patients who had a 
ventriculoperitoneal shunt were more likely to go into rehabilitation than 
patients who did not, and patients without a ventriculoperitoneal shunt were 
more likely to die.
CONCLUSION: Older age should not preclude a patient from aneurysm treatment. 
Factors such as low Hunt and Hess or World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 
grades, earlier presentation to the hospital after initial symptoms, early 
shunting, prompt interventions, and tailored postoperative management can result 
in favorable clinical outcomes.

Royal Prince Alfred and Liverpool Hospitals, and the Department of Head and Neck 
Surgery, Liverpool Hospital.

BACKGROUND: Radical parotidectomy presents a unique combination of 
reconstructive challenges. The high visibility of the region and the specialized 
structures involved create an interdependence between aesthetics and function. 
This article describes the authors' surgical concepts and experience in 
post-radical parotidectomy reconstruction.
METHODS: The various components of reconstruction following radical 
parotidectomy, including contour restoration, skin coverage, mandible 
reconstruction, and facial reanimation, are reviewed. The authors discuss their 
methods of choice and specific technical refinements. Twenty-one post-radical 
parotidectomy reconstruction patients (male:female, 17:4; median age, 75 years) 
treated from July of 2006 through May of 2010 were identified. Information on 
patient demographics, etiology, reconstruction technique, surgical 
complications, postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, and survival was obtained.
RESULTS: The most common indication for radical parotidectomy was metastatic 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, followed by carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma 
and direct extension from primary cutaneous malignancy. The authors' standard 
approach in reconstruction was a combination of anterolateral thigh free flap 
and cervicofacial rotation advancement flap, repair of the facial nerve with the 
nerve to the vastus lateralis segmental interpositional graft, gold weight 
loading of the upper eyelid, lateral canthopexy, temporalis and digastric muscle 
transfers, and a delayed brow lift. Surgical complications include 
undercorrection of facial reanimation, gold weight extrusion, wound breakdown, 
and infections. Seventeen patients (81 percent) received adjuvant radiotherapy 
(range, 50 to 66 Gy to the primary site, 40 to 60 Gy to the neck).
CONCLUSIONS: Radical parotidectomy is a morbid procedure that is sometimes 
necessary for oncologic control. With sound principles and attention to detail 
in reconstruction, however, quality of life can be greatly improved.

BACKGROUND: The rising life expectancy of cancer patients has led to a greater 
need for treatment of spinal metastases. Interdisciplinary collaboration is 
important so that each patient's treatment can be properly tailored to the 
overall prognosis. The main factors to be considered are the histology of the 
primary tumor, potential spinal instability, and compression of neural 
structures.
METHODS: We discuss the treatment options for spinal metastases on the basis of 
a selective literature review and our own extensive experience in an 
interdisciplinary tumor center.
RESULTS: For spinal canal compression or impending spinal instability, the 
treatment of choice is decompression and stabilization, by either a dorsal 
approach (lumbar and thoracic spine) or a ventral approach (cervical spine). 
Radical ventral tumor resection is indicated only for solitary metastases in 
patients with a favorable long-range prognosis. If the tumor is radiosensitive, 
radiotherapy is given either as adjuvant treatment after surgery or as the 
primary treatment for multiple spinal metastases in the absence of an acute 
neurological deficit. Various fractionation schemes with different total 
radiation doses are used. Bisphosphonate treatment is an integral component of 
the overall treatment strategy.
CONCLUSION: The treatment of spinal metastases requires interdisciplinary 
collaboration and must be tailored to each patient's overall prognosis.

Leg pain and psychological variables predict outcome 2-3 years after lumbar 
fusion surgery.

Prediction studies testing a thorough range of psychological variables in 
addition to demographic, work-related and clinical variables are lacking in 
lumbar fusion surgery research. This prospective cohort study aimed at examining 
predictions of functional disability, back pain and health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) 2-3 years after lumbar fusion by regressing nonlinear relations in 
a multivariate predictive model of pre-surgical variables. Before and 2-3 years 
after lumbar fusion surgery, patients completed measures investigating 
demographics, work-related variables, clinical variables, functional 
self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, fear of movement/(re)injury, mental health 
and pain coping. Categorical regression with optimal scaling transformation, 
elastic net regularization and bootstrapping were used to investigate predictor 
variables and address predictive model validity. The most parsimonious and 
stable subset of pre-surgical predictor variables explained 41.6, 36.0 and 25.6% 
of the variance in functional disability, back pain intensity and HRQOL 2-3 
years after lumbar fusion. Pre-surgical control over pain significantly 
predicted functional disability and HRQOL. Pre-surgical catastrophizing and leg 
pain intensity significantly predicted functional disability and back pain while 
the pre-surgical straight leg raise significantly predicted back pain. 
Post-operative psychomotor therapy also significantly predicted functional 
disability while pre-surgical outcome expectations significantly predicted 
HRQOL. For the median dichotomised classification of functional disability, back 
pain intensity and HRQOL levels 2-3 years post-surgery, the discriminative 
ability of the prediction models was of good quality. The results demonstrate 
the importance of pre-surgical psychological factors, leg pain intensity, 
straight leg raise and post-operative psychomotor therapy in the predictions of 
functional disability, back pain and HRQOL-related outcomes.

Success and failure of primary medical, nonoperative management in breast 
cancer.

Author information:
(1)Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Basel (UHB), 
Basel, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: Nonoperative but systemic therapy as first-line management is 
offered to some patients with breast cancer (BC) who have assumed limited life 
expectancy, such as older women or those who have distant metastases at initial 
presentation. We evaluated rates of and predicting factors for success and 
failure of this therapy approach.
METHODS: Seventy-five patients who were initially treated only systemically, and 
cases in which local control while avoiding surgery was the intended long-term 
therapy goal were analyzed. Additionally, two stage-dependent subgroups were 
distinguished (A: stage I-III, n = 31; B: stage IV, n = 44). Failure of therapy 
was defined as when secondary surgery had to be performed due to locoregional 
progression or in case of no surgery when severe locoregional clinical 
signs/symptoms were observed during the further course.
RESULTS: Patients in group A were older than those in group B (81 vs. 67.5 
years; P < 0.001) and showed an increased survival (5-year rates: 40.2% vs. 
24.3%). In 24 patients of the entire cohort (32%), secondary surgery had to be 
performed; surgery was performed more often in group A (58.1% vs. 13.6%). In the 
cases in which no surgery was performed (n = 51), 11 women (21.6%) suffered from 
severe locoregional symptoms in the palliative situation (A: n = 1; B: n = 10). 
Although the presence of stage IV was a significant factor for therapy success 
(odds ratio (OR), 2.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-7.05; P = 0.039), 
skin involvement was associated with failure of therapy (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 
1.16-11.11; P = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative treatment may be offered to selected patients with BC 
who have assumed limited life expectancy. These women must be openly informed 
that this approach is not successful in nearly half of the cases.

Economic evaluation of human papilloma virus vaccination in the European Union: 
a critical review.

    Intern Emerg Med. 2011 Apr;6(2):157-8.

The human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine is a new and expensive vaccine 
potentially effective in the prevention of a cancer. We reviewed the economic 
evaluations (EEs) on the vaccine in the EU to assess their potential 
contribution to public decision-making in a fairly homogeneous setting where HPV 
vaccination has been widely adopted. A literature search on PubMed selected EEs 
on HPV vaccines in the EU for the period 2007-2010 using the terms "HPV 
vaccines" and "Costs and cost analysis." Fifteen articles were eventually 
selected. All studies were based on modelling techniques, either "cohort" or 
"dynamic transmission": three were cost utility, three cost-effectiveness, and 
the remainder included both. The ten studies explicitly assessing one of the two 
vaccines were all sponsored by their manufacturer, while the five studies 
unrelated to the vaccine type were funded by public agencies. Apart from two 
studies, utility estimates were always obtained from three US sources. Direct 
costs were always vaccination, diagnosis and treatment of related pathologies. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) results were less favourable when 
life years gained were valued rather than quality-adjusted life years, genital 
warts were excluded, and booster doses and extension of vaccination to men were 
included in the base-case analysis. All but one of the sponsored EEs recommend 
in favour of the vaccination strategy, which is dominant in one English study. 
The ICER results were very sensitive to discount rates, followed by duration of 
protection and vaccine price. At such an early stage, when the vaccines' 
efficacy have been demonstrated by well-designed studies, it is not possible 
(and not even reasonable) to wait for several years to measure their 
effectiveness; public decision-makers might benefit more from EEs designed to 
indicate sustainable prices using realistic estimates of crucial variables like 
coverage rates, rather than referring to a large number of assumptions in order 
to show acceptable cost-effectiveness.

United States life tables by Hispanic origin.

Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Division of Vital Statistics, 
Hyattsville, MD 20782, USA.

OBJECTIVES: This report presents complete period life tables by Hispanic origin, 
race for the non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black populations, and sex for 
the United States based on age-specific death rates in 2006.
METHODS: The methods used to estimate the probability of death for ages 0-80 for 
the Hispanic population and 0-65 for the non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic 
black populations are the same as those used in annual U.S. life tables since 
1997, with an important modification. Age-specific death rates are first 
corrected for racial and ethnic misclassification on U.S. death certificates. To 
address the effects of age misstatement at the oldest ages, the methodology used 
to estimate mortality for ages 66 and over for the non-Hispanic white and 
non-Hispanic black populations is the same as that used to estimate the annual 
life tables since 2005. For the Hispanic population, the probability of death 
for ages over 80 is estimated as a function of non-Hispanic white mortality with 
the use of the Brass relational logit model.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth for the total population in 2006 was 77.7 
years; 80.6 years for the Hispanic population, 78.1 years for the non-Hispanic 
white population, and 72.9 years for the non-Hispanic black population. The 
Hispanic population has a life expectancy advantage at birth of 2.5 years over 
the non-Hispanic white population and 7.7 years over the non-Hispanic black 
population. Although seemingly paradoxical, these results are consistent with 
the findings of numerous studies which show a Hispanic mortality advantage 
despite this population's lower socioeconomic status. Nonetheless, the 
procedures used in this report to correct for racial and ethnic 
misclassification and age misstatement are not error free and therefore some of 
the observed advantage may still be a function of data artifact. This report 
does not address other factors that may explain the Hispanic mortality 
advantage.

We use human-skeleton samples to estimate the height of adults living in 
Anatolia during the Neolithic period. We also report the results of surveys 
taken in the 20th century on the height of the Turkish population. Neolithic and 
the Chalcolithic (5000-3000 B.C.) male heights are estimated as 170.9 cm and 
165.0 cm, respectively. Pronounced increases were observed for both sexes 
between the Chalcolithic and Iron (1000-580 B.C.) periods and sharp decreases 
among both males and females in the Hellenistic-Roman period (333 B.C. to 395 
A.D.). Moreover, recovery to the Iron Age levels was achieved in the Anatolian 
Medieval period (395-1453 A.D.) for both sexes (169.4 cm for males and 158.0 cm 
for females). In 1884 the mean height of men was 162.2 cm and by the beginning 
of the 1930s it increased to 166.3 cm. In the first nationwide survey in 1937 
males mean height was 165.3 cm, and females was 152.3 cm, where today current 
heights are 174.0 cm and 158.9 cm, respectively.

treated patients with R5 HIV-1 infection from the perspective of the Spanish 
health care system.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from the 
perspective of the Spanish health care system, of optimized background therapy 
(OBT) plus maraviroc 300 mg BID versus OBT plus placebo in previously treated 
patients with R5 HIV-1 infection.
METHODS: A lifetime cohort model was developed, based on 24- and 48-week pooled 
results from the Maraviroc Versus Optimized Therapy in Viremic Antiretroviral 
Treatment-Experienced Patients (MOTIVATE) studies 1 and 2, to reflect the 
Spanish health care system's perspective. Treatment duration was based on 
clinical trial follow-up from MOTIVATE 1 and 2. Clinical data, cohort 
characteristics, success probability, CD4 increase rate, CD4 cell status link to 
disease states, and adverse-event probability were taken from the MOTIVATE 
trials and other published literature. Other input parameters were taken from 
published sources. Antiretroviral (ARV) costs were derived from local sources. 
Non-ARV drug costs were obtained from published literature and a cost database. 
All costs were calculated as year-2009 euros. The annual discount rate was set 
at 3.0%. The main outcomes were cost per life-year gained (LYG) and cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Uncertainty was assessed with one-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the model analysis, adding maraviroc to OBT was associated with an 
increase of 0.952 LYG and 0.909 QALY. Total costs were €275,970 for maraviroc 
plus OBT and €254,655 for placebo plus OBT (difference: €21,315). The 
incremental cost per LYG was €22,398 and the incremental cost per QALY gained 
was €23,457. The model appeared to be robust for variations in key parameters. 
Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that the 
probability of the cost per QALY being below €30,000 was 99%.
CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of the model, our analysis suggested that 
OBT plus maraviroc 300 mg BID is a clinically valuable option, and 
cost-effective from the perspective of the Spanish health care system, for 
previously treated patients with R5 HIV-1 infection.

Expansins are proteins that are the key regulators of wall extension during 
plant growth. To investigate the role of TaEXPB23, a wheat expansin gene, we 
analyzed TaEXPB23 mRNA expression levels in response to water stress in wheat 
and examined the drought resistance of transgenic tobaccos over-expressing 
TaEXPB23. We found that the expression of TaEXPB23 corresponded to wheat 
coleoptile growth and the response to water stress. The results also indicated 
that the transgenic tobacco lines lost water more slowly than the wild-type (WT) 
plants under drought stress; their cells could sustain a more integrated 
structure under water stress than that of WT. Other physiological and 
biochemical parameters under water stress, such as electrolyte leakage, 
malondialdehyde (MDA) level, photosynthetic rate, F(v)/F(m) and ΦPSII, also 
suggested that the transgenic tobaccos were more drought resistant than WT 
plants.

OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of post-intubation tracheal stenoses is 
surgical reconstruction of the airway. Stenting of the trachea using silastic 
T-tubes or one of the various types of tracheal stents are the alternative ways 
to surgical reconstruction for the management of post-intubation tracheal 
stenoses. The early and long-term results of 11 patients with post-intubation 
tracheal stenosis, who underwent tracheal stenting with self-expandable metallic 
stents (SEMSs), are presented.
METHODS: Twelve patients (10 men, mean age: 47.8±20.4 years) with 
post-intubation tracheal stenosis were referred for tracheal stenting with SEMS 
(2000-2004). In three cases, the upper tracheal stenosis extended within the 
subglottic larynx. Stenting was successful in 11 patients, while, in one patient 
with involvement of the subglottic larynx, the attempt to insert the stent 
failed. Follow-up time varied from 6 to 96 months, and it was made with virtual 
and fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
RESULTS: Immediate relief of obstructive symptoms was observed in all the 11 
patients, where an SEMS was successfully inserted. Stent dislodgement occurred 
shortly after the procedure in two patients, and it was treated with insertion 
of a new stent in the first case and a stent-on-stent insertion in the second. 
Good patency of the stent was observed in three patients for 60-96 months. Three 
patients with good patency of the stent died from other reasons 24-48 months 
after stent insertion. Four patients developed obstructive granulation tissue at 
the ends of the stent after 12-43 months, requiring further treatment with 
thermal lasers and/or tracheostomy. One patient underwent stent removal and 
successful laryngotracheal reconstruction 6 months after stent insertion.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of SEMS in post-intubation tracheal stenoses 
results in immediate improvement of obstructive symptoms without significant 
perioperative complications. SEMSs have the potential risks of migration and of 
granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. SEMS should be applied 
only in strictly selected patients with post-intubation tracheal stenosis, who 
are considered unfit for surgery and/or with limited life expectancy.

The evolution of patient selection criteria and indications for extracorporeal 
life support in pediatric cardiopulmonary failure: next time, let's not eat the 
bones.

Bill James, baseball statistician and author, tells the story of hungry cavemen 
sitting about a campfire, waiting for tomatoes to ripen. One has the inspiration 
to throw an ox on the fire, and the first barbecue ensued and was endured. After 
eating, the conversation goes something like this. "There were some good parts." 
"Yeah, but there were some bad parts." And the smart one says, "This time, let's 
not eat the bones." The evolution of patient selection criteria for the use of 
extracorporeal support (ECLS) is a bit like those cavemen and their first 
barbecued ox. Extracorporeal life support technology and application to patient 
care is the unique result of a long standing history of ambitious attempt, 
evaluation, debate, collaboration and extension.

AIM: The DALY measure represents a new tool for improving the capacity of local 
health unit to assess population health needs and priorities. Our study aimed to 
increase the validity of the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), by 
incorporating local estimates of the disease incidence and applying 
population-specific disability weights.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study enrolling subjects aged 45+ years, 
first-time admitted to the hospital with principal diagnosis of 490-492, 496 ICD 
IX-CM codes and followed for one year to evaluate the vital status. A subset was 
administered the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire to estimate the 
distribution of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related 
disability.
RESULTS: Estimates of total DALY (per 1000) for COPD varied between 2.1 to 3.4 
years among men and between 1.0 to 2.3 years among women; percentages of years 
of life lost due to a premature mortality were between 60 and 70%.
CONCLUSION: The DALY represents a new tool for improving the capacity to assess 
population health needs and priorities. Policy makers owning such a further 
element of evaluation may be better oriented in allocating resources for COPD 
among the different health care chapters: prevention, emergency, chronicity and 
rehabilitation.

Axons of primary olfactory neurons are intimately associated with olfactory 
ensheathing cells (OECs) from the olfactory epithelium until the final targeting 
of axons within the olfactory bulb. However, little is understood about the 
nature and role of interactions between OECs and axons during development of the 
olfactory nerve pathway. We have used high resolution time-lapse microscopy to 
examine the growth and interactions of olfactory axons and OECs in vitro. 
Transgenic mice expressing fluorescent reporters in primary olfactory axons 
(OMP-ZsGreen) and ensheathing cells (S100ß-DsRed) enabled us to selectively 
analyse these cell types in explants of olfactory epithelium. We reveal here 
that rather than providing only a permissive substrate for axon growth, OECs 
play an active role in modulating the growth of pioneer olfactory axons. We show 
that the interactions between OECs and axons were dependent on lamellipodial 
waves on the shaft of OEC processes. The motility of OECs was mediated by GDNF, 
which stimulated cell migration and increased the apparent motility of the 
axons, whereas loss of OECs via laser ablation of the cells inhibited olfactory 
axon outgrowth. These results demonstrate that the migration of OECs strongly 
regulates the motility of axons and that stimulation of OEC motility enhances 
axon extension and growth cone activity.

Role of cellular mechanics in the function and life span of vascular 
endothelium.

The vascular endothelium plays a crucial role in vessel homeostasis and is 
implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The function and life 
span of endothelial cells, therefore, have a large impact upon the quality and 
expectancy of an individual's life. Exposure to haemodynamic forces determines 
the phenotype of endothelial cells. Turbulent blood flow, disturbed shear stress 
and a rising tension of the vessel wall result in endothelial dysfunction and an 
enhanced endothelial cell turnover. In this scenario, the role of endothelial 
mechanics is yet poorly described. The streaming blood exerts shear forces 
transmitted to the soft cortical actin mesh immediately underneath the plasma 
membrane. The mechanical properties of this actin cortex seem to be an important 
regulator of endothelial function. Aldosterone and high plasma sodium stiffen 
the endothelial cell cortex which is accompanied by a decrease in NO release. If 
endothelial stiffening is only transient, it may be a useful mechanism to 
compensate for any decrease in arterial blood pressure. Long-term stiffening of 
the cell, however, may lead to endothelial dysfunction and may contribute to 
cardiovascular disorders, as observed in disturbed aldosterone/sodium 
homeostasis. In this case, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist 
spironolactone maintains the endothelial cell cortex soft and thereby preserves 
normal endothelial function and longevity. This may explain the recently 
observed beneficial effects of spironolactone on the cardiovascular system. 
Taken together, the review highlights the importance of elasticity for normal 
endothelial function.

Demographic and economic correlates of development as measured by energy 
consumption.

Saunders JV(1), Reinhart GR.

Author information:
(1)University of Florida, USA.

Per capita consumption of energy in 112 world areas was related to a series of 
economic and demographic variables. Linear associations were found for four 
economic variables, and a curvilinear association in the form of a J curve for 
four demographic variables. It was found that the exponential distribution y = 
e(-X) for the curves for the demographic variables (crude birth rate, infant 
mortality rate, percent of deaths from contagious and infectious diseases, and 
life expectancy). By using a table of exponential functions, one can determine 
values for the distribution of these variables and the crude death rate for any 
desired level of energy consumption.

This paper reviews the arguments for maintaining a separate series of statistics 
for the white and nonwhite populations of the United States; only by maintaining 
factual data will it be possible to document inequality and discrimination. It 
then summarizes some white-nonwhite differentials: fertility, life expectancy, 
health, school attendance, educational attainment, and income. The human, 
social, and political implications are then reviewed.

To improve the quality of life of elderly people in Japanese society where women 
have the longest life expectancy in the world, osteoporosis, and hyperlipidemia 
are among the major targets of medical treatment. To differentiate two types of 
regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT), we tried to evaluate the 
efficacy on lipid and bone metabolism. With informed consent, 34 postmenopausal 
women of more than 2 years were assigned to receive 1 of 2 types of HRT (the HRT 
group) for 12 months observation: one with a combination of conjugated equine 
estrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg/day and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg/day 
(the CEE group), and the other with oral estriol (E3) 2 mg/day (the E3 group). 
Parameters of serum lipid were measured, as well as those of bone metabolism 
with bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using 
QDR-2000. In HRT groups, lipid and bone metabolism were confirmed to be 
improved. Whereas, an increase of triglycerides (TG) observed in the CEE group 
was not observed in the E3 group. Thus, in the clinical management of 
postmenopausal women, oral E3 preparation as an alternative regimen for HRT for 
CEE might be efficacious.

PURPOSE: Preferred hemodialysis (HD) access is an autologous fistula. Vascular 
grafts are used in patients with vessels unsuitable to accomplish an 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF). It is recommended that most current grafts mature 
in situ for 2-3 weeks before being accessed. Graft complications occur because 
the structure was not designed for the trauma of repeated cannulation. This 
study graft has a different structure that enables early use. Its design 
minimizes weeping through the graft walls and is meant to endure repeated 
access, thus minimizing the use of HD catheters. The purpose of this study was 
to show that the Flixene™ graft can be safely placed in patients where fistulas 
have failed and can be cannulated in 24-72 hr, while maintaining patency rates 
similar to other polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts on the market. Flixene™ 
configuration should also reduce the incidence of pseudoaneurysms and seromas.
METHODS: A prospective two-center study placed 33 grafts in 33 patients; graft 
efficacy, post-operative complications, and patency were evaluated. Ease of 
cannulation and dialysis center complications related to early cannulation were 
documented. Six month follow-up data was analyzed.
RESULTS: Successful access was achieved in all 33 patients within 72 hr (29 
patients within 24 hr). Overall primary patency at 6 months was 49%; 
primary-assisted patency at 6 months was 80%. No pseudoaneurysms or seromas were 
documented at 6 months. Complications were typical of graft access.
CONCLUSION: Early cannulation was successful in all patients. Primary and 
secondary patency rates at 6-months were equivalent to other data reported on 
PTFE grafts. Flixene™ successfully prevented pseudoaneurysm and seroma formation 
at 6 months of prospective follow-up. This graft is a better last-resort option 
for patients who cannot receive a fistula, compared to double-lumen cuffed 
catheters.

Sex differences in the consequences of early-life exposure to epidemiological 
stress--a life-history approach.

OBJECTIVES: Exposure to infectious disease in early life has been suggested to 
have a negative effect on later-life survival,possibly through the induction of 
inflammatory responses. Although a life-course perspective emphasizes the 
importance of both survival and reproduction for individual fitness, to date, no 
studies have investigated whether early-life exposure to infectious disease has 
an impact on reproduction as it has been suggested for later survival.
METHODS: To address this question, I have used family reconstitution data from a 
historical (18th and 19th century) human population in the Krummhörn (Germany) 
comparing survival and reproduction between an exposed and a non-exposed group. 
The exposed group comprised those exposed to a high-infectious disease load 
during prenatal and early postnatal development.
RESULTS: The results show a marked sex difference in the impact of early-life 
exposure to infectious disease. Exposed females show no effect on their life 
expectancy but significantly reduced fertility (number of children). For exposed 
males, however, the effect on survival is opponent over time: mortality is 
increased during childhood but decreased in late adulthood. Above that, exposed 
males reproduce earlier and have a smaller proportion of surviving children.
CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support former studies indicating a negative 
association between early-life disease load and later survival. I argue that due 
to differences in male and female life strategies, males in general are more 
vulnerable especially early in life. Hence, adverse environmental conditions may 
have a stronger effect on male survivability and reproductive performance.

BACKGROUND: Obesity and knee osteoarthritis are among the most frequent chronic 
conditions affecting Americans aged 50 to 84 years.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate quality-adjusted life-years lost due to obesity and knee 
osteoarthritis and health benefits of reducing obesity prevalence to levels 
observed a decade ago.
DESIGN: The U.S. Census and obesity data from national data sources were 
combined with estimated prevalence of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis to assign 
persons aged 50 to 84 years to 4 subpopulations: nonobese without knee 
osteoarthritis (reference group), nonobese with knee osteoarthritis, obese 
without knee osteoarthritis, and obese with knee osteoarthritis. The 
Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a computer simulation model of knee osteoarthritis 
and obesity, was used to estimate quality-adjusted life-year losses due to knee
