BACKGROUND: Exercise may be a therapeutic tool for improving the functional 
capacity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on hemodialysis 
(HD).
AIM: To determine the effects on muscle strength (MS), functional capacity (FC) 
and quality of life related to health (QOLRH) of a resistance training program 
in patients with CKD on HD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen CKD patients aged 38.8 ± 3 years, (7 men) on HD 
for more than one year participated in an exercise program twice a week during 8 
weeks. At the beginning and at the end of the program, MS using a knee extension 
isometric strength test, FC using the six minutes walking test (6MWT) and QOLRH 
using the KDQOL CV-36 questionnaire were evaluated. Heart and respiratory rates, 
blood pressure, oxygen saturation and modified Borg scale were measured as 
control variables.
RESULTS: After training, there were significant improvements in MS in both legs; 
in the distance travelled during 6MWT and in the physical component summary 
score of the KDQOL-36. Furthermore, a significant decline in diastolic blood 
pressure was observed. All other control variables did not change significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise training during eight weeks in CKD patients in HD resulted 
in significant improvements in muscle strength, walking capacity and in the 
physical component of a quality of life score for patients with CKD.

Marfan syndrome is a rare multisystem disease of the connective tissue, which 
affects multiple organ systems. advances in healthcare have doubled the 
life-expectancy of patients over the past three decades. to date, there is no 
comprehensive review that consolidates economic considerations and care for 
marfan patients. Areas covered: Present research suggests that there may be a 
link between treatment pattern, disease progression and economic costs of Marfan 
syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the disease and preventive 
interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective, it may reduce the 
amount of emergency surgery or intervention, and inpatient stays. In addition, 
it slows disease progression, lowers lifestyle restrictions, reduces 
psychological stress, and improves health-related quality of life. Expert 
commentary: Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual 
aim by simultaneously containing costs and reducing the number and length of 
inpatient stays.

AIMS: The British National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines 
recommend to use drug-eluting stents (DES) instead of bare-metal stents (BMS) 
only in lesions >15 mm in length or in vessels <3 mm in diameter. We analyzed 
the impact of stent length and stent diameter on in-stent restenosis (ISR) in 
the BASKET-PROVE study population and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of DES 
compared to BMS.
METHODS/RESULTS: The BASKET-PROVE trial compared DES vs BMS in large coronary 
arteries (≥3 mm). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with regard to quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained and target lesion revascularizations (TLRs) avoided. A 
total of 2278 patients were included in the analysis. A total of 74 ISR in 63 
patients were observed. In-stent restenosis was significantly more frequent in 
segments treated with a BMS compared to segments treated with a DES (5.4% vs 
0.76%; P<.001). The benefit of a DES compared to a BMS regarding ISR was 
consistent among the subgroups of stent length >15 mm and ≤15 mm, respectively. 
With the use of DES in short lesions, there was only a minimal gain of 0.005 in 
QALYs. At a threshold of 10 000 CHF per TLR avoided, DES had a high probability 
of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: In the BASKET-PROVE study population, the strongest predictor of ISR 
is the use of a BMS, even in patients in need of stents ≥3.0 mm and ≤15 mm 
lesion length and DES were cost-effective. This should prompt the NICE to 
reevaluate its recommendation to use DES instead of BMS only in vessels <3.0 mm 
and lesions >15 mm length.

INTRODUCTION: The lengthening of life expectancy associated with multiple 
comorbidities leads physicians and nurses to manage more and more patients with 
long-term urinary catheterization (LTUC). No recommendation is written about the 
management of LTUC patients. To assess the need to publish recommendations and 
tools to help nurses in a better management of LTUC, we conducted a survey of 
theoretical and practical knowledge of French nurses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological prospective study, type of practical 
studies in a declarative fashion, anonymous, made via computerized poll released 
on the website www.infirmiers.com.
RESULTS: A total of 1254 registered nurses fulfilled the questionnaire. We 
observed a massive heterogeneity in different aspects of LTUC: local care and 
products used in them, urine bag change rhythm, lubrication of the catheter, 
respect of closed system, the rhythm of catheter change and in the management of 
blocked catheters. In total, 76% of nurses desire a theoretical and practical 
help for LTUC.
CONCLUSION: We found a great diversity of knowledge and practices in terms of 
LTUC. In total, 40.67% of nurses realized at least a technical error during 
catheterization. To standardize the management of LTUC, we propose to draft 
recommendations under the aegis of the French Association of Urology. This will 
allow a better education of students, and providing online available support.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common 
adverse effect reported in patients receiving opioids to manage pain. Initial 
treatment with laxatives provides inadequate response in some patients. 
Naloxegol is a peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist used to treat 
patients with inadequate response to laxative(s) (laxative inadequate responder 
[LIR]). A cost-effectiveness model was constructed from the UK payer perspective 
to compare oral naloxegol 25 mg with placebo in non-cancer LIR patients 
receiving opioids for chronic pain, and a scenario analysis of naloxegol 25 mg 
with rescue laxatives compared with placebo with rescue laxatives in the same 
patient population.
METHODS: The model comprised a decision tree for the first 4 weeks of treatment, 
followed by a Markov model with a 4-week cycle length and the following states: 
'OIC', 'non-OIC (on treatment)', 'non-OIC (untreated)' and 'death'. Two 
phase III trials with a follow-up period of 12 weeks provided data on treatment 
efficacy, transition probabilities, adverse event frequency and patient utility. 
Resource utilisation data were sourced from a UK-based burden of illness study 
and physician surveys. A UK National Health Service and Personal Social Service 
perspective was adopted; costs and health-related quality of life gains were 
discounted at a rate of 3.5 %. The model was run over a time horizon of 5 years, 
reflecting the average period of opioid use.
RESULTS: Naloxegol has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £10,849 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained versus placebo, and £11,179 when rescue 
laxatives are made available in both arms (2014 values). Model outcomes were 
only sensitive to variations in utility inputs. However, the probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses indicate that naloxegol has a 91 % probability of being 
cost effective at a £20,000 threshold when compared with placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Naloxegol is likely a cost-effective treatment option for LIR 
patients with OIC. This assessment should be supported by further work on the 
utility of patients with OIC, including how utility varies with more granular 
measures of OIC.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs): Ancient compounds that represent novel weapons in 
the fight against bacteria.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short peptidic molecules produced by most 
living creatures. They help unicellular organisms to successfully compete for 
nutrients with other organisms sharing their biological niche, while AMPs form 
part of the immune system of multicellular creatures. Thus, these molecules 
represent biological weapons that have evolved over millions of years as a 
result of an escalating arms race for survival among living organisms. All AMPs 
share common features, such as a small size, with cationic and hydrophobic 
sequences within a linear or cyclic structure. AMPs can inhibit or kill bacteria 
at micromolar concentrations, often by non-specific mechanisms; hence the 
appearance of resistance to these antimicrobials is rare. Moreover, AMPs can 
kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including insidious microbes such as 
Acinetobacter baumannii and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 
This review gives a detailed insight into a selection of the most prominent and 
interesting AMPs with antibacterial activity. In the near future AMPs, due to 
their properties and despite their ancient origin, should represent a novel 
alternative to antibiotics in the struggle to control pathogenic microorganisms 
and maintain the current human life expectancy.

Fungal infections of the lungs are relatively common and potentially 
life-threatening conditions in immunocompromised children. The role of imaging 
in children with lung mycosis is to delineate the extension of pulmonary 
involvement, to assess response to therapy, and to monitor for adverse sequelae 
such as bronchiectasis and cavitation. The aim of this paper is to show imaging 
findings in a series of patients with fungal pneumonia from two tertiary 
children's hospitals, to discuss differential diagnoses and to show how imaging 
findings can vary depending on the host immune response.

PURPOSE: The purpose is to provide an update the Bone Metastases Guideline 
published in 2011 based on evidence complemented by expert opinion. The update 
will discuss new high-quality literature for the 8 key questions from the 
original guideline and implications for practice.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic PubMed search from the last date included in 
the original Guideline yielded 414 relevant articles. Ultimately, 20 randomized 
controlled trials, 32 prospective nonrandomized studies, and 4 
meta-analyses/pooled analyses were selected and abstracted into evidence tables. 
The authors synthesized the evidence and reached consensus on the included 
recommendations.
RESULTS: Available literature continues to support pain relief equivalency 
between single and multiple fraction regimens for bone metastases. High-quality 
data confirm single fraction radiation therapy may be delivered to spine lesions 
with acceptable late toxicity. One prospective, randomized trial confirms both 
peripheral and spine-based painful metastases can be successfully and safely 
palliated with retreatment for recurrence pain with adherence to published 
dosing constraints. Advanced radiation therapy techniques such as stereotactic 
body radiation therapy lack high-quality data, leading the panel to favor its 
use on a clinical trial or when results will be collected in a registry. The 
panel's conclusion remains that surgery, radionuclides, bisphosphonates, and 
kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty do not obviate the need for external beam radiation 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: Updated data analysis confirms that radiation therapy provides 
excellent palliation for painful bone metastases and that retreatment is safe 
and effective. Although adherence to evidence-based medicine is critical, 
thorough expert radiation oncology physician judgment and discretion regarding 
number of fractions and advanced techniques are also essential to optimize 
outcomes when considering the patient's overall health, life expectancy, 
comorbidities, tumor biology, anatomy, previous treatment including prior 
radiation at or near current site of treatment, tumor and normal tissue response 
history to local and systemic therapies, and other factors related to the 
patient, tumor characteristics, or treatment.

Considering a network approach to health determinants, we test the hypothesis 
that benefits of high socioeconomic status (SES) may be transmitted up the 
generational ladder from offspring to parents. Studies that examine own SES and 
own health outcomes, or SES of parents and outcomes of young or adolescent 
children, are common. Those that investigate SES of offspring and their 
association with parental health are rare. Employing data from a historical 
population of individuals extracted from a comprehensive population database 
that links demographic and vital records across generations, this study tests 
the hypothesis that higher offspring SES associates with lower parental 
mortality after controlling for parental SES. The sample includes 29,972 
individuals born between 1864 and 1883 whose offspring were born between 1886 
and 1920. SES is operationalized using Nam-Powers occupational status scores 
divided into quartiles and a category for farmers. Models assess mortality risk 
after age 40. Included is a test for whether effects are proportional across 
parents who died younger and older. Estimated life expectancies across 
categories of offspring SES conditioned on parental SES are calculated to 
illustrate specifically how differences in SES relate to differences in years 
lived. Results indicate a longevity penalty for those whose offspring have low 
SES and a longevity dividend for those with high-SES offspring. The influence of 
offspring attributes on well-being of parents points to fluid and myriad 
linkages between generations.

INTRODUCTION: In the Netherlands, the current standard of care for treating 
patients with end-stage renal disease is three sessions of in-center 
hemodialysis (conventional ICHD). However, the literature indicates that high 
dose hemodialysis (high dose HD) may provide better health outcome such as 
survival and quality of life. The objective of this study was to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of high dose HD, both in-center and at home, in comparison to 
conventional ICHD from a Dutch payer's perspective over a 5 year period. 
Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of conventional HD at home in comparison to 
conventional ICHD will be analysed.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed assuming 28-day treatment cycles and was 
populated with data from Dutch and international renal registries, official 
tariffs and medical literature. Univariable and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Using publicly available tariffs from the Dutch Healthcare Authority 
(Nederlandse Zorgautoriteit) of 2015, doing high dose ICHD instead of 
conventional ICHD shows an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
€275,747 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In contrast, the ICER of 
high dose HD at home in comparison to conventional ICHD is €3248 per gained 
QALY. The final analysis shows that conventional HD at home is less costly per 
patient (-€3063) than conventional ICHD and results in health benefit 
improvement (+0.249 QALYs), and is therefore regarded as cost saving.
CONCLUSION: Treating dialysis patients with conventional HD at home shows to be 
cost saving in comparison to conventional ICHD. However, the magnitude of 
clinical benefit of high dose HD at home is over two times greater than the 
clinical benefit of conventional HD at home. According to our analysis, from a 
payer's perspective, high dose HD should be offered as a home therapy to obtain 
its clinical benefits in a cost-effective manner. Future research should 
consider our findings alongside societal factors, such as patient preference, 
monitoring cost for the home patient, productivity loss and capacity.

The endophytic fungus Harpophora oryzae is a beneficial endosymbiont isolated 
from wild rice. H. oryzae can not only promote rice growth and biomass 
accumulation but also protect rice roots from invasion by its close relative 
Magnaporthe oryzae. Autophagy is a highly evolutionary conserved process from 
lower to higher eukaryotic organisms, and is involved in the maintenance of 
normal cell differentiation and development. In this study, we isolated a gene 
(HoATG5) which encodes an essential protein required for autophagy from the 
beneficial endophyte fungus H. oryzae. Using targeted gene replacement, a 
ΔHoATG5 mutant was generated and used to investigate the biological functions of 
autophagy in H. oryzae. We found that the autophagic process was blocked in the 
HoATG5 deletion mutant. The mutant showed increased vegetative growth and 
sporulation, and was sensitive to nutrient starvation. The ΔHoATG5 mutant lost 
its ability to penetrate and infect the wounded barley leaves. These results 
provide new knowledge to elaborate the molecular machinery of autophagy in 
endophytic fungi.

The amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane protein that is widely 
expressed within the central nervous system (CNS). While the pathogenic 
dysfunction of this protein has been extensively studied in the context of 
Alzheimer's disease, its normal function is poorly understood, and reports have 
often appeared contradictory. In this study we have examined the role of APP in 
regulating neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain by comparing neural stem cell 
proliferation, as well as new neuron number and morphology between APP knockout 
mice and C57bl6 controls. Short-term EdU administration revealed that the number 
of proliferating EdU+ neural progenitor cells and the number of PSA-NCAM+ 
neuroblasts produced in the SVZ and dentate gyrus were not affected by the 
life-long absence of APP. However, by labelling newborn cells with EdU and then 
following their fate over-time, we determined that ~48% more newly generated 
EdU+ NeuN+ neurons accumulated in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb 
and ~57% more in the dentate gyrus of young adult APP knockout mice relative to 
C57bl6 controls. Furthermore, proportionally fewer of the adult-born olfactory 
bulb granule neurons were calretinin+. To determine whether APP was having an 
effect on neuronal maturation, we administered tamoxifen to young adult 
Nestin-CreERT2::Rosa26-YFP and Nestin-CreERT2::Rosa26-YFP::APP-knockout mice, 
fluorescently labelling ~80% of newborn (EdU+) NeuN+ dentate granule neurons 
formed between P75 and P105. Our analysis of their morphology revealed that 
neurons added to the hippocampus of APP knockout mice have shorter dendritic 
arbors and only half the number of branch points as those generated in C57bl6 
mice. We conclude that APP reduces the survival of newborn neurons in the 
olfactory bulb and hippocampus, but that it does not influence all neuronal 
subtypes equally. Additionally, APP influences dentate granule neuron

BACKGROUND: In September, 2015, the UN General Assembly established the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 
targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 
health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015).
METHODS: We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to 
estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries 
from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed 
value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 
health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG 
indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and 
health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed 
as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline 
regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a 
summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and 
total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices.
FINDINGS: In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59·3 (95% uncertainty 
interval 56·8-61·8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85·5 (84·2-86·5) 
in Iceland to 20·4 (15·4-24·9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good 
predictor of the health-related SDG index (r2=0·88) and the MDG index (r2=0·92), 
whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r2=0·79). Between 2000 
and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7·9 (IQR 
5·0-10·4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10·0 [6·7-13·1]) 
exceeded that of the non-MDG index (a median change of 5·5 [2·1-8·9]). Since 
2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern 
contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the 
indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate 
improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, 
minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight 
considerably worsened.
INTERPRETATION: GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring 
progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the 
importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement 
but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be 
sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators 
has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, 
accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or 
worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for 
additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the 
health-related SDGs.

BACKGROUND: With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act, cost-effectiveness analyses are becoming increasingly important for 
resource allocation, and particularly for the justification of costly 
procedures, such as total knee and total hip arthroplasties (TKAs and THAs). 
Therefore, using the Short Form-6D (SF-6D) utility values, the purpose of this 
study was to determine (1) the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and 
(2) and the cost-effectiveness of undergoing THA and TKA.
METHODS: A total of 844 patients (357 men, 487 women) who had a mean age of 65 
years (range, 39 to 80 years) underwent primary TKA, and 224 patients who had a 
mean age of 69 years (range, 44 to 88 years) underwent primary THAs at 7 
institutions. The SF-6D values were derived for each patient preoperatively and 
at 1-year follow-up. QALYs were estimated at 1 year, and lifetime QALYs gained 
were determined using predicted life-expectancy values, at a discounted rate of 
3% per year of life expectancy, to reflect a diminishing gain with time. 
National-level costs were determined using the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were deduced for both groups.
RESULTS: The preoperative SF-6D values for the THA and TKA cohorts were 0.614 
(range, 0.37 to 1) and 0.62 (range, 0.3 to 0.93). Postoperatively, SF-6D values 
improved significantly at 1 year in both groups. One-year QALYs for TKA and THA 
were 0.768 and 0.799. Lifetime QALYs gained for the groups were 2.07 and 1.85 
(1.39 and 1.34 if discounted at a rate of 3% per year). The estimated ICER for 
TKA vs baseline presurgery was $43,107 per QALY, and $39,453 per QALY for THA vs 
baseline presurgery.
CONCLUSION: The ICER showed that THA and TKA are cost-effective, compared to the 
$50,000 USD/QALY threshold for cost-effectiveness, and justify resources 
allocated to these surgeries. The SF-6D can utilize existing functional outcome 
data, which makes these cost calculations considerably easier and more feasible 
for practicing orthopedists.

BACKGROUND: Previous estimates of the burden of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), 
and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among people who inject drugs have not included 
estimates of the burden attributable to the consequences of past injecting. We 
aimed to provide these estimates as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
Study 2013.
METHODS: We modelled the burden of HBV and HCV (including cirrhosis and liver 
cancer burden) and HIV at the country, regional, and global level. We extracted 
United Nations data on the proportion of notified HIV cases by transmission 
route, and estimated the contribution of injecting drug use (IDU) to HBV and HCV 
disease burden by use of a cohort method that recalibrated individuals' history 
of IDU, and accumulated risk of HBV and HCV due to IDU. We estimated data on 
current IDU from a meta-analysis of HBV and HCV incidence among injecting drug 
users and country-level data on the incidence of HBV and HCV between 1990 and 
2013. We calculated estimates of burden of disease through years of life lost 
(YLL), years of life lived with disability (YLD), deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) 
calculated for each metric.
FINDINGS: In 2013, an estimated 10·08 million DALYs were attributable to 
previous exposure to HIV, HBV, and HCV via IDU, a four-times increase since 
1990. In total in 2013, IDU was estimated to cause 4·0% (2·82 million DALYs, 95% 
UI 2·4 million to 3·8 million) of DALYs due to HIV, 1·1% (216 000, 
101 000-338 000) of DALYs due to HBV, and 39·1% (7·05 million, 5·88 million to 
8·15 million) of DALYs due to HCV. IDU-attributable HIV burden was highest in 
low-to-middle-income countries, and IDU-attributable HCV burden was highest in 
high-income countries.
INTERPRETATION: IDU is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. 
Effective interventions to prevent and treat these important causes of health 
burden need to be scaled up.

BACKGROUND: Information is scarce about the geographic variation in time trends 
of mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD). We aimed to describe trends in 
death rates, absolute number of deaths and years of life lost (YLL) due to CHD 
among men and women in Portugal, by region, from 1981 to 2012.
METHODS: The age-standardized mortality rates from CHD were estimated by sex and 
region. We used joinpoint regression analysis to calculate the annual percent 
change (APC) in mortality and to identify points of significant change in the 
trend. The YLL due to premature mortality for CHD were computed using the Global 
Burden of Disease method.
RESULTS: The age-adjusted mortality from CHD decreased between 1981 and 2012, 
both in men and women, but with significantly different APC by region. Smaller 
declines in rates were observed in Alentejo (men: APC 1993-2012: -2.4%; women: 
APC 1991-2012: -2.4%). The greatest decline was observed in Madeira between 2003 
and 2012, in men (APC: -7.6%) and women (APC: -9.7%). The decline in rates in 
Algarve started only after 2003, whereas it was consistent from 1981 in the 
North and started in the 1990s in most other regions. A decrease in the number 
of deaths was only observed after 2000. The YLL from CHD decreased from 1981 to 
2012, mainly after 2000.
CONCLUSIONS: In Portugal, between 1981 and 2012, relative declines of CHD 
mortality indicators were different by geographic region. Consistent decreases 
in mortality rates were only observed in the Centre, Lisbon and North, the most 
populated and urbanized regions.

Primary myelofibrosis is one of the Philadelphia negative chronic 
myeloproliferative neoplasms. It is a rare disease featured by cytopenias and 
hepatosplenomegaly. Although the etiology of the disease is still unknown, our 
knowledge about its pathology and prognosis has been improving in the last few 
years. Furthermore, the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has become available in 
Hungary since 2015. Beside its high efficacy in spleen volume and in reduction 
of myelofibrosis-associated symptoms, this novel therapy also exerts a 
disease-modifying effect and, therefore, ruxolitinib may improve the life 
expectancy too. Treatment approach of myelofibrosis has been changed these 
years, which gives a reason for this summary. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(39),

PURPOSE: End stage heart failure and transplant present great opportunities and 
challenges for patients of all ages. However, young adulthood may present 
additional specific challenges associated with the development of identity, 
career and romantic relationships. Despite recognition of greater mortality 
rates in young adults, consideration of the experience of transplant during this 
life stage has been largely overlooked in the literature. The aim of this study 
was to explore the experience of heart transplant in young adults.
METHOD: Interviews were conducted with nine participants across three transplant 
services in the United Kingdom and the data subject to interpretative 
phenomenological analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis identified three themes. "Separating from illness" and 
"working toward normality" involved limiting the influence of illness on 
identity, as well as reengaging with typical functioning in young adulthood. 
"Integrating transplant into identity" involved acknowledging the influence of 
living with a shortened life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The need for support that recognizes specific challenges of 
transplant as a young adult is discussed (e.g. the development of age specific 
end of life pathways, improved communication between transplant recipients, 
their families and teams), including consideration of the impact of societal 
discourses (e.g. gift of life) which provided additional challenges for 
patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Heart transplant presents specific 
challenges according to the recipient's life stage. The needs of young adult 
recipients should be considered. Transplant professionals should consider 
providing opportunities for peer support and addressing the identities and 
values of young adult transplant recipients during rehabilitation.

Growth hormone (GH) is a naturally occurring polypeptide hormone produced by 
somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary. The main function of somatotropin 
is stimulation of linear growth, but it also affects carbohydrate metabolism, 
increases bone mass and has potent lipolytic, antinatriuretic and antidiuretic 
effects. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) may occur both in children and in 
adults. At the moment there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of GHD, and 
the diagnosis should take into account clinical, auxological, biochemical and 
radiological changes and, if necessary, genetic testing. Recent studies have 
highlighted that the biochemical diagnosis of GH deficiency is still imperfect. 
Stimuli used in the tests are non-physiological, and various substances are 
characterized by a different mechanism of action and potency. A few years ago it 
was thought that GHD treatment in children must be completed at the end of 
linear growth. Studies performed in the last two decades have shown that GHD 
deficiency in adults may result in complex clinical problems, and if untreated 
shortens the life expectancy and worsens its comfort. Discontinuation of GH 
therapy after the final height has been reached in fact negatively impacts the 
physiological processes associated with the transition phase, which is the 
period of human life between achieving the final height and 25-30 years of age. 
Given the adverse metabolic effects of GH treatment interruption after linear 
growth has been completed, the latest recommendations propose reassessment of GH 
secretion in the period at least one month after cessation of treatment and 
continuation of the therapy in case of persistent deficit.
