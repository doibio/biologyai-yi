increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, selected cancer 
patients with AIS may benefit from rtPA treatment. Active cancer should not be 
considered an absolute contraindication to rtPA use. Risk of complications and 
life expectancy should be assessed when making this decision.

Publisher: TITLE: Seguridad y efectividad del rtPA en el ictus isquemico agudo 
en pacientes con cancer activo: estudio de casos y controles.
Introduccion. Los pacientes con cancer tiene un mayor riesgo de ictus debido a 
los efectos malignos directos e indirectos. La trombolisis intravenosa con 
activador tisular del plasminogeno recombinante (rtPA) constituye un tratamiento 
medico estandar para el ictus isquemico agudo. Objetivo. Revisar el uso de rtPA 
en el ictus isquemico agudo en pacientes con cancer activo. Sujetos y metodos. 
Estudio retrospectivo observacional de casos y controles para evaluar pacientes 
con ictus isquemico agudo y cancer admitidos en la unidad de ictus entre enero 
de 2010 y junio de 2015. Resultados. Se identificaron siete casos (86% varones; 
mediana de edad: 76 años) y tambien se incluyeron 20 controles pareados por edad 
y clasificacion del Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project. Un 29% de casos 
experimento complicaciones directas del procedimiento frente a un 30% en el 
grupo control. Un 14% sufrio transformacion hemorragica (frente a un 20%). Un 
paciente (caso) sufrio una hemorragia sistemica grave, y otro (control), una 
hemorragia intracerebral grave. A los tres meses, un 43% era independiente 
(frente a un 25% de los controles) y un 29% habia fallecido (frente a un 30%). 
Un subtipo etiologico indeterminado (clasificacion TOAST) era mas frecuente en 
pacientes con cancer (71% frente a 20%). Conclusion. Complicaciones hemorragicas 
graves, potenciadas por el rtPA, pueden incrementar el riesgo de morbilidad y 
mortalidad. Sin embargo, pacientes seleccionados con cancer que padecen un ictus 
isquemico agudo pueden beneficiarse del tratamiento con rtPA. Un cancer activo 
no deberia considerarse una contraindicacion de uso de rtPA, aunque debe 
evaluarse el riesgo de complicaciones y la esperanza de vida para tomar la 
decision.

OBJECTIVES: Decision making around the use of thrombolysis for patients with 
intermediate-risk (submassive) pulmonary embolism (PE) remains challenging. 
Studies indicate favorable clinical outcomes with systemic thrombolytics 
(intravenous tissue plasminogen activator [IV tPA]), but the risk of major 
bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke is a deterrent. Catheter-directed thrombolysis 
(CDT) may be a preferable strategy, as it has been shown to have a lower risk of 
bleeding than systemic thrombolysis. However, a three-arm randomized control 
study comparing IV tPA, CDT, and anticoagulation alone, with long-term follow 
up, would be costly and is unlikely to be performed. The aim of this study was 
to use decision modeling to quantitatively estimate the differences between the 
three strategies.
METHODS: We created an individual-level state-transition model to simulate 
long-term outcomes of a hypothetical patient cohort treated with IV tPA, CDT, or 
anticoagulation alone. Our model incorporated clinical randomized controlled 
trial and longitudinal study data to inform patient characteristics and outcomes 
specific to each study arm. The base case was a 65-year-old patient. 
Additionally, we utilized preliminary data published by the Pulmonary Embolism 
Response Team at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Variance in model inputs 
was addressed with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Our 
primary endpoint was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Secondary endpoints 
included total cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Catheter-directed thrombolysis (mean, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
7.388 [7.381-7.396] QALYs) resulted in the most long-term utility for eligible 
patients compared to anticoagulation alone (7.352 [7.345-7.360] QALYs) or IV tPA 
(7.343 [7.336-7.351] QALYs). Patients receiving CDT had an elevated risk of 
hemorrhagic stroke in comparison to anticoagulation alone; however, patients 
treated with anticoagulation alone were more likely to experience recurrent PE 
associated adverse outcomes. Results were stable with sensitivity analyses 
varying age and sex. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessing joint 
variance predicts CDT to be the most effective strategy, when measured by mean 
QALYs, in 98.4% of runs, while systemic thrombolysis was favored over 
anticoagulation alone 34.4% of the time. The ICER of CDT compared to 
anticoagulation was $317,042 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: In our model, for those eligible, CDT results in the largest number 
of QALYs for patients with intermediate-risk PE, although it is relatively 
expensive and the absolute difference in QALYs between anticoagulation alone and 
CDT is small. Future studies that provide data on longitudinal quality-of-life 
outcomes of patients treated for PE and characteristics of CDT would be 
beneficial to augment model inputs, inform assumptions, and validate results.

OBJECTIVE: To identify variables predicting psychotherapy outcome for panic 
disorder or indicating which of 2 very different forms of 
psychotherapy-panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP) or 
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-would be more effective for particular 
patients.
METHOD: Data were from 161 adults participating in a randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) including these psychotherapies. Patients included 104 women; 118 patients 
were White, 33 were Black, and 10 were of other races; 24 were Latino(a). 
Predictors/moderators measured at baseline or by Session 2 of treatment were 
used to predict change on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS).
RESULTS: Higher expectancy for treatment gains (Credibility/Expectancy 
Questionnaire d = -1.05, CI95% [-1.50, -0.60]), and later age of onset (d = 
-0.65, CI95% [-0.98, -0.32]) were predictive of greater change. Both variables 
were also significant moderators: patients with low expectancy of improvement 
improved significantly less in PFPP than their counterparts in CBT, whereas this 
was not the case for patients with average or high levels of expectancy. When 
patients had an onset of panic disorder later in life (≥27.5 years old), they 
fared as well in PFPP as CBT. In contrast, at low and mean levels of onset age, 
CBT was the more effective treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Predictive variables suggest possibly fruitful foci for improvement 
of treatment outcome. In terms of moderation, CBT was the more consistently 
effective treatment, but moderators identified some patients who would do as 
well in PFPP as in CBT, thereby widening empirically supported options for 
treatment of this disorder. (PsycINFO Database Record

Among the many milestones in the last several decades in the management of 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer and high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer 
including the extension of the standard lymph node dissection and the use of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, minimally invasive techniques have gained traction as 
an attractive option for radical cystectomy. Open radical cystectomy is plagued 
with high rates of perioperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality, and 
as robotic assistance has demonstrated benefits in other arenas of surgery and 
urology, the evolution of the approach to radical cystectomy has likewise 
incorporated robotic assistance. We thus sought to critically review the 
literature comparing open radical cystectomy with robotic-assisted radical 
cystectomy. Perioperative and oncologic outcomes as well as cost analyses and 
health-related quality of life were compared between the two approaches, and 
identified manuscripts were categorized according to level of evidence.

INTRODUCTION: Globally, life expectancy together with multimorbidity and chronic 
diseases are increasing. This leads to a growing demand for care and hence for 
healthcare personnel and nurses. To meet this demand, healthcare workers from 
abroad are increasingly hired. The nurses' workplace in general is characterized 
by physically and psychologically demanding tasks, while that of migrant and 
minority nurses is additionally characterized by discriminatory practices. The 
present knowledge about the health of migrant and minority nurses and the 
terminology in this context are diverse. Thus, the purpose of this review is to 
systematically identify and synthesize international publications that 
explicitly focus on migrant nurses' health.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of relevant studies was undertaken 
using the databases Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science. The screening 
process was conducted in several phases. This review was conducted in accordance 
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines while the methodological quality assessment of the included 
papers was performed with the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT).
RESULTS: Out of 11,599 citations initially obtained, 14 empirical studies were 
included in the final synthesis. The methodological quality of the empirical 
studies and reviews was diverse. The majority of the studies were conducted in 
the US and the nurses under study migrated from countries like the Philippines, 
India, Europe, and Africa. Among migrant nurses of different origins, there are 
differences in their physiological responses to stress. Migrant nurses and 
native nurses differ in reporting work-related injuries.
DISCUSSION: Migrant and minority nurses are at high risk of work-related 
injuries and discrimination than native or majority nurses. However, mixed 
results were obtained, namely that the reported health of migrant nurses either 
improves over time or it decreases. This review revealed that discrimination is 
the leading cause of impaired health amongst migrant and minority nurses.

BACKGROUND: A recent recalibration of the ONCOTYROL Prostate Cancer Outcome and 
Policy (PCOP) Model, assuming that latent prostate cancer (PCa) detectable at 
autopsy might be detectable by screening as well, resulted in considerable 
worsening of the benefit-harm balance of screening. In this study, we used the 
recalibrated model to assess the effects of familial risk, quality of life (QoL) 
preferences, age, and active surveillance.
METHODS: Men with average and elevated familial PCa risk were simulated in 
separate models, differing in familial risk parameters. Familial risk was 
assumed to affect PCa onset and progression simultaneously in the base-case, and 
separately in scenario analyses. Evaluated screening strategies included 
one-time screening at different ages, and screening at different intervals and 
age ranges. Optimal screening strategies were identified depending on age and 
individual QoL preferences. Strategies were additionally evaluated with active 
surveillance by biennial re-biopsy delaying treatment of localized cancer until 
grade progression to Gleason score ≥ 7.
RESULTS: Screening men with average PCa risk reduced quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE) even under favorable assumptions. Men with elevated familial 
risk, depending on age and disutilities, gained QALE. While for men with 
familial risk aged 55 and 60 years annual screening to age 69 was the optimal 
strategy over most disutility ranges, no screening was the preferred option for 
65 year-old men with average and above disutilities. Active surveillance greatly 
reduced overtreatment, but QALE gains by averted adverse events were opposed by 
losses due to delayed treatment and additional biopsies. The effect of active 
surveillance on the benefit-harm balance of screening differed between 
populations, as net losses and gains in QALE predicted for screening without 
active surveillance in men with average and familial PCa risk, respectively, 
were both reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: Assumptions about PCa risk and screen-detectable prevalence 
significantly affect the benefit-harm balance of screening. Based on the 
assumptions of our model, PCa screening should focus on candidates with familial 
predisposition with consideration of individual QoL preferences and age. Active 
surveillance may require treatment initiation before Gleason score progression 
to 7. Alternative active surveillance strategies should be evaluated in further 
modeling studies.

BACKGROUND: Cancer and cancer treatment coincide with substantial negative 
physical, psychological and psychosocial problems. Physical activity (PA) can 
positively affect the negative effects of cancer and cancer treatment and 
thereby increase quality of life in CPS. Nevertheless, only a minority of CPS 
meet PA guidelines. We developed the OncoActive (OncoActief in Dutch) 
intervention: a computer-tailored PA program to stimulate PA in prostate and 
colorectal CPS, because to our knowledge there are only a few PA interventions 
for these specific cancer types in the Netherlands METHODS: The OncoActive 
intervention was developed through systematic adaptation of a proven effective, 
evidence-based, computer-tailored PA intervention for adults over fifty, called 
Active Plus. The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to guide the 
systematic adaptation. A literature study and interviews with prostate and 
colorectal CPS and health care professionals revealed that both general and 
cancer-specific PA determinants are important and should be addressed. Change 
objectives, theoretical methods and applications and the actual program content 
were adapted to address the specific needs, beliefs and cancer-related issues of 
prostate and colorectal CPS. Intervention participants received tailored PA 
advice three times, on internet and with printed materials, and a pedometer to 
set goals to improve PA. Pre- and pilot tests showed that the intervention was 
highly appreciated (target group) and regarded safe and feasible (healthcare 
professionals). The effectiveness of the intervention is being evaluated in a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n = 428), consisting of an intervention group 
and a usual care waiting-list control group, with follow-up measurements at 
three, six and twelve months. Participants are recruited from seventeen 
hospitals and with posters, flyers and calls in several media.
DISCUSSION: Using the Intervention Mapping protocol resulted in a systematically 
adapted, theory and evidence-based intervention providing tailored PA advice to 
prostate and colorectal CPS. If the intervention turns out to be effective in 
increasing PA, as evaluated in a RCT, possibilities for nationwide 
implementation and extension to other cancer types will be explored.

(NTR4296) on November 23rd 2013 and can be accessed at

The number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their life 
expectancy has been increasing. With time number of patients undergoing spine 
surgery has also been on a rise. This study we did a retrospective review of 
registry data to investigate the mortality rate of chronic kidney disease 
patients following spine surgery using a large, multi-center spine registry. 
12,276 consecutive spine-fusion patients from January 2009 to December 2012 were 
included and mortality rates in patients with CKD compared to those with normal 
kidney function following spine surgery. Logistic regression was usedto evaluate 
risk of mortality following spine surgery. The average age of the cohort was 59 
(SD=13.4). 53% were female. Patients who had stage 3, 4 or 5 CKD were older than 
non-CKD patients (mean=71,SD=9.2 vs. 59, SD=13.3). After adjusting for 
confounding variables, patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD had higher mortality rates 
than patients with normal kidney function (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.3-2.45) 
Hemodialysis-dependent patients (stage 5 CKD) had even higher rates of mortality 
compared to patients with normal function (OR 4.18, 95% CI1.87-9.34). our 
findings suggest that spine surgery is associated with significantly higher 
mortality rates in patients with CKD compared to patients with normal kidney 
function. Understanding the additional morbidity and mortality of spine surgery 
in this medically complicated group of patients is imperative for accurate 
preoperative risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: Beyond the age of 80 years, the preventive treatment of an 
asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has to be decided in light of the 
life expectancy which it is difficult to evaluate, but it is important to 
determine who in this population will benefit from it. The objective of our 
study was to determine the factors influencing short-term mortality and 
long-term survival in patients aged 80 years and older after the endovascular 
treatment of AAAs (EVAR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a retrospective analysis of the prospective 
databases of 4 French academic departments of vascular surgery, bringing 
together the data of all the patients presenting an AAA who were treated by EVAR 
between 1998 and 2011. Logistic regression and multivariate analysis with a Cox 
survival model were used to determine the factors influencing perioperative and 
long-term mortality. The cumulative rate of events for the measurement of 
survival was calculated with the technique of Kaplan-Meier.
RESULTS: We treated 345 octogenarians and 339 younger patients. The average 
follow-up was 40 months. Average survival was 75% at 36 months and 49% at 
60 months. There was no evidence of any risk factor influencing mortality at 
30 days in the octogenarians. However, chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 
[OR] = 3.95, P <0.001) and chronic respiratory failure (OR = 2.62, P <0.001) 
proved to be independent factors of a poor long-term prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment by stent graft in octogenarians is effective in the 
long term. The presence of an impaired renal function or respiratory failure in 
this population could put into question the operative indication.

Prevalence of age-associated cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has dramatically 
increased as a result of improvements in life expectancy. Chronic inflammation 
is a shared pathophysiological feature of age-associated CVDs, indicating a role 
for the immune system in the onset and development of CVDs. Indeed, ageing 
elicits profound changes in both the cardiovascular and immune system, 
especially in the T cell compartment. Although such changes have been well 
described at the cellular level, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
immune-mediated cardiovascular ageing remain largely unexplored. Non-coding RNAs 
(ncRNAs) comprise a heterogeneous family of RNA transcripts that regulate gene 
expression at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and 
post-translational levels. Non-coding RNAs have recently emerged as master 
modulators of T cell immunity. In this review, the state-of-the-art knowledge on 
ncRNA regulatory effects over T cell differentiation, function, and ageing in 
the context of age-associated CVDs, such as atherosclerosis, acute coronary 
syndromes, and heart failure, is discussed.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare interstitial lung disease limited 
to the lung with an undefined etiopathogenesis and a very short life expectancy 
(less than 5 years). IPF susceptibility has been associated with several genetic 
and environmental risk factors and the prognosis is conditioned by comorbidities 
such as gastro-esophageal reflux, depression, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary 
hypertension and lung cancer. At 5 years follow-up, 15% of IPF patients develop 
lung cancer, which can significantly reduce their survival. Because diagnostic 
or therapeutic procedures such as surgical, radiation or pharmacological 
treatments may induce acute exacerbations and increase mortality, the management 
of lung cancer in IPF patients is a very difficult task. This study discusses 
advantages and disadvantages of lung cancer treatments in patients with severe 
IPF, highlighting several controversial aspects on this topic, including 
potential nintedanib treatment.

Biallelic mutations in SLC25A46, encoding a modified solute transporter involved 
in mitochondrial dynamics, have been identified in a wide range of conditions 
such as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with optic atrophy type VIB 
(OMIM: *610826) and congenital lethal pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH). To date, 
18 patients from 13 families have been reported, presenting with the key 
clinical features of optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebellar 
atrophy. The course of the disease was highly variable ranging from severe 
muscular hypotonia at birth and early death to first manifestations in late 
childhood and survival into the fifties. Here we report on 4 patients from 2 
families diagnosed with PCH who died within the first month of life from 
respiratory insufficiency. Patients from 1 family had pathoanatomically proven 
spinal motor neuron degeneration (PCH1). Using exome sequencing, we identified 
biallelic disease-segregating loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A46 in both 
families. Our study adds to the definition of the SLC25A46-associated phenotypic 
spectrum that includes neonatal fatalities due to PCH as the severe extreme.

We introduce a simplified and modular architecture for design and construction 
of complex origami nanostructures. A series of basic two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional structures are presented. As the resulting structures can be 
virtually divided into blocks, modular remodeling such as translocation, 
contraction/extension, and bending is carried out. Structures under such a 
designing framework are morphable. Local conformational changes can propagate to 
the entire structure to reshape the global conformation.

Increased life expectancy in persons with Down syndrome (DS) is associated with 
premature age-related changes. The aim of this study was to assess auditory 
function in adults with DS and to evaluate the prevalence of hearing loss in 
this population. Audiometric tests were performed in 72 adults with DS (mean age 
37.3±10.1 years, 51.4% females). Air conduction pure tone average (PTA) 
thresholds at frequencies 0.5-1-2-4 kHz were calculated to assess hearing 
function. Hearing loss was present if the PTA threshold was > 20 dB hearing 
level. Higher frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz were also assessed. Hearing loss was 
shown in 47 (65.3%) participants. The prevalence of hearing loss increased with 
age, ranging from 42.86% in the 20-29 years group to 90.91% in the 50-59 years 
group. High frequencies (4 and 8 kHz) were more often impaired than other 
frequencies used to measure PTA. Thus, the study concluded hearing loss is 
common in adults with DS and shows a pattern compatible with precocious aging of 
the hearing system. Auditory evaluation is strongly recommended in adults with 
DS.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to compare percutaneous vascular 
interventions (PVI) versus bypass surgeries (BSX) in patients with critical limb 
ischemia (CLI).
BACKGROUND: Previous relevant reviews with limited numbers of included studies 
did not strictly confine the inclusion criteria to CLI, also involving patients 
with severe claudication, which may introduce bias in the decision-making of CLI 
revascularization. Current treatment strategies for CLI still remain 
controversial.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of all available randomized controlled 
trials and observational clinical studies comparing PVI with BSX in CLI 
patients. Primary endpoints included overall survival, amputation-free survival, 
30-day mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.
RESULTS: We identified 45 cohorts and 1 RCT in over 20,903 patients. In overall 
population, PVI reduced the risks of 30-day mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.95), major adverse cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular events (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29-0.61), and surgical site infection 
(OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.19-0.51), but increased the risks of long-term all-cause 
mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.27) and primary patency failure 
(HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.58). When compared with autogenous BSX, PVI was also 
associated with additional increased risks of long-term death or amputation (HR 
1.41, 95% CI 1.02-1.94) and secondary patency failure (HR 1.51, 95% CI 
1.17-1.95). In patients with infrapopliteal lesions, we found PVI had inferior 
primary patency (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.75) compared with BSX.
CONCLUSION: For patients in good physical condition with long life-expectancy, 
BSX may represent a better choice compared with PVI, particularly when 
autogenous bypass is available. While enhanced perioperative care for 
cardiovascular events and surgical site should be considered in patients 
underwent BSX to achieve comparable short-term outcomes provided by PVI.

Breakthrough cancer Pain (BTcP) has a high prevalence in cancer population. 
Patients with BTcP reported relevant health care costs and poor quality of life. 
The study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the available Oral Fentanyl 
Formulations (OFFs) for BTcP in Italy. A decision-analytical model was developed 
to estimate costs and benefits associated with treatments, from the Italian NHS 
perspective. Expected reductions in pain intensity per BTcP episodes were 
translated into, percentage of BTcP reduction, resource use and 
Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs). Relative efficacy, resources used and unit 
costs data were derived from the literature and validated by clinical experts. 
Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. At 
base-case analysis, Sublingual Fentanyl Citrate (FCSL) compared to other oral 
formulations reported a lower patient's cost (€1,960.8) and a higher efficacy 
(18.7% of BTcP avoided and 0.0507 QALYs gained). The sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the main results in all tested scenarios, with the highest impact 
reported by BTcP duration and health care resources consumption parameters. 
Between OFFs, FCSL is the cost-effective option due to faster reduction of pain 
intensity. However, new research is needed to better understand the economic and 
epidemiologic impact of BTcP, and to collect more robust data on economic and 
quality of life impact of the different fentanyl formulations. Different 
fentanyl formulations are available to manage BTcP in cancer population. The 
study is the first that assesses the different impact in terms of cost and 
effectiveness of OFFs, providing new information to better allocate the 
resources available to treat BTcP and highlighting the need of better data.

BACKGROUND: A sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax in Mexico has been effective in 
reducing consumption of SSBs, with larger decreases for low-income households. 
The health and financial effects across socioeconomic groups are important 
considerations for policy-makers. From a societal perspective, we assessed the 
potential cost-effectiveness, health gains, and financial impacts by 
socioeconomic position (SEP) of a 20% SSB tax for Australia.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Australia-specific price elasticities were used to predict 
decreases in SSB consumption for each Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) 
quintile. Changes in body mass index (BMI) were based on SSB consumption, BMI 
from the Australian Health Survey 2011-12, and energy balance equations. Markov 
cohort models were used to estimate the health impact for the Australian 
population, taking into account obesity-related diseases. Health-adjusted life 
years (HALYs) gained, healthcare costs saved, and out-of-pocket costs were 
estimated for each SEIFA quintile. Loss of economic welfare was calculated as 
the amount of deadweight loss in excess of taxation revenue. A 20% SSB tax would 
lead to HALY gains of 175,300 (95% CI: 68,700; 277,800) and healthcare cost 
savings of AU$1,733 million (m) (95% CI: $650m; $2,744m) over the lifetime of 
the population, with 49.5% of the total health gains accruing to the 2 lowest 
quintiles. We estimated the increase in annual expenditure on SSBs to be 
AU$35.40/capita (0.54% of expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks) in the 
lowest SEIFA quintile, a difference of AU$3.80/capita (0.32%) compared to the 
highest quintile. Annual tax revenue was estimated at AU$642.9m (95% CI: 
$348.2m; $1,117.2m). The main limitations of this study, as with all simulation 
models, is that the results represent only the best estimate of a potential 
effect in the absence of stronger direct evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that from a 20% tax on SSBs, the most HALYs 
gained and healthcare costs saved would accrue to the most disadvantaged 
quintiles in Australia. Whilst those in more disadvantaged areas would pay more 
SSB tax, the difference between areas is small. The equity of the tax could be 
further improved if the tax revenue were used to fund initiatives benefiting 
those with greater disadvantage.

INTRODUCTION: Reduction of social and territorial differences with regards to 
health of a population is one of the most crucial global problems of public 
health. An analysis of years of life lost focuses on social and economic aspects 
of premature mortality.
AIM: The aim of the study is to analyze territorial differences in years of life 
lost due to premature mortality in inhabitants of various regions of Polan d, 
according to the most important causes of death, with consideration given to 
classification categories of ICD-10.
METHODS: The study material included a database which contained information 
gathered from 387,312 death certificates of inhabitants of Poland in 2013. The 
SEYLLp index (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) was used 
to calculate standard expected years of life lost.
RESULTS: The absolute number of years of life lost in inhabitants of Poland for 
the year 2013 was 4,168,256 in males and 2,536,447 in females, which 
corresponded to 2,237 years per 10,000 males and 1,277 per 10,000 females. 
Inhabitants of the Lodz Province are characterized with the highest number of 
years of life lost (2,858 years per 10,000 males and 1,544 per 10,000 females), 
whereas inhabitants of the Subcarpathian Province are characterized with the 
lowest number of years of life lost (1,833 years per 10,000 males and 1,039 per 
10,000 females). In the male group, the highest SEYLLp values were contributed 
by: ischemic heart disease (217 years), malignant neoplasms of the trachea, 
bronchi and lungs (175 years) and cardiac insufficiency (156 years), whereas in 
the female group, the causes included: cerebral diseases (106 years), cardiac 
insufficiency (105 years) and ischemic heart disease (103 years)
CONCLUSIONS: There are huge territorial differences in Poland with regards to a 
number of years of life lost. Thus, there is a need to continue studies in order 
to find an explanation for these differences and gradually eliminate them.

Phytocystatins are a group of proteins with significant potential to regulate 
activities of cysteine proteinases of native and pest/pathogen origins. The 
two-domain triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.) phytocystatin TrcC-8 was 
characterized in this study. This protein belongs to the second group of 
phytocystatins and contains all the conserved sequences and motifs as well as 
both N-terminal (CY) and C-terminal (CY-L) domains that are characteristic of 
phytocystatins with the C-terminal extension. We demonstrated that TrcC-8 forms 
stable dimers with a significantly reduced inhibitory activity against papain 
compared to the activity of monomers, indicating the regulatory nature of the 
oligomerization. Moreover, according to our research, only the N-terminal domain 
possesses the ability to form dimers, indicating that this part of TrcC-8 is 
involved in the dimerization of the full-length protein. Homology modelling of 
TrcC-8 strongly suggests distinct specificities for the CY and CY-L domains, 
confirmed in experiments with inhibition of the papain. Our results suggest that 
the CY domain of TrcC-8 may, although markedly weakly and suboptimally, interact 
with papain in an analogous mode to tarocystatin, while the CY-L domain of 
TrcC-8 has distinct specificity than tarocystatin.

It is well known that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has a high mortality 
rate. Despite progress in understanding the biology and genetic basis of this 
disease, life expectancy has changed minimally in the last 50 years. This 
article highlights the importance of screening patients at high risk for 
developing pancreatic cancer and reviews current methods as well as methods in 
development for pancreatic cancer early detection and surveillance.
