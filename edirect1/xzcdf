significant correlations with LEB. While, the utilization of domestic coal and 
biomass showed significant negative correlations with LEB, and household 
electricity shows positive correlations. The utilization of domestic coal in 
China showed a negative effect on LEB, rather than central heating. To improve 
the solid fuel stoves and control consumption of domestic coal consumption and 
other low quality solid fuel is imperative to improve the public health level in 
China in the future.

The challenge of reducing the salt content while maintaining shelf life, 
stability and acceptability of the products is major for the food industry. In 
the present study, we implemented processing adjustments to reduce salt content 
while maintaining the machinability and the saltiness perception of sheeted 
dough: the homogeneous distribution of a layer of encapsulated salt grains on 
the dough during the laminating process. During sheeting, for an imposed 
deformation of 0.67, the final strain remained unchanged around 0.50 for salt 
reduction below 50%, and then, increased significantly up to 0.53 for a dough 
without salt. This increase is, in fine, positive regarding the rolling process 
since the decrease of salt content induces less shrinkage of dough downstream, 
which is the main feature to be controlled in the process. Moreover, the final 
strain was negatively correlated to the resistance to extension measured with a 
texture analyzer, therefore providing a method to evaluate the machinability of 
the dough. From these results, a salt reduction of 25% was achieved by holding 
50% of the salt in the dough recipe to maintain the dough properties and saving 
25% as salt grains to create high-salted areas that would enhance the saltiness 
perception of the dough. The distributor mounted above the rollers of the mill 
proved to be able to distribute evenly salt grains at a calculated step of the 
rolling out process. An innovative method based on RX micro-tomography allowed 
to follow the salt dissolving and to demonstrate the capability of the coatings 
to delay the salt dissolving and consequently the diffusion of salt within the 
dough piece. Finally, a ranking test on the salted perception of different 
samples having either an even distribution of encapsulated salt grains, a single 
layer of salt grains or a homogeneous distribution of salt, demonstrated that 
increasing the saltiness perception in salt-reduced food product could be 
achieved by a technological approach.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Minimally invasive lumbar spinal stenosis procedures have 
uncertain long-term value.
PURPOSE: This study sought to characterize factors affecting the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of such procedures using interspinous spacer devices 
("spacers") relative to decompression surgery as a case study.
STUDY DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review database for the years 
2005-2009 was used to model a group of 65-year-old patients with spinal stenosis 
who had no previous spine surgery and no contraindications to decompression 
surgery.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost per QALY 
gained were the outcome measures.
METHODS: A Markov model tracked health utility and costs over 10 years for a 
65-year-old cohort under three care strategies: conservative care, spacer 
surgery, and decompression surgery. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) 
reported as cost per QALY gained included direct medical costsfor surgery. 
Medicare claims data were used to estimate complication rates, reoperation, and 
related costs within 3 years. Utilities and long-term reoperation rates for 
decompression were derived frompublished studies. Spacer failure requiring 
reoperation beyond 3 years and post-spacer health utilities are uncertain and 
were evaluated through sensitivity analyses. In the base-case, the spacer 
failure rate was held constant for years 4-10 (cumulative failure: 47%). In a 
"worst-case" analysis, the 10-year cumulative reoperation rate was increased 
steeply (to 90%). Threshold analyses were performed to determine the impact of 
failure and post-spacer health utility on the cost-effectiveness of spacer 
surgery.
RESULTS: The spacer strategy had an ICER of $89,500/QALY gained under base-case 
assumptions, and remained under $100,000 as long as the 10-year cumulative 
probability of reoperation did not exceed 54%. Under worst-case assumptions, the 
spacer ICER was $482,000/QALY and fell below $100,000 only if post-spacer 
utility was 0.01 greater than post-decompression utility or the cost of spacer 
surgery was $1,600 less than the cost of decompression surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Spacers may provide a reasonably cost-effective initial treatment 
option for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. Their value is expected to 
improve if procedure costs are lower in outpatient settings where these 
procedures are increasingly being performed. Decision analysis is useful for 
characterizing the long-term cost-effectiveness potential for minimally invasive 
spinal stenosis treatments and highlights the importance of complication rates 
and prospective health utility assessment.

OBJECTIVES: Holistic needs assessment (HNA) and care planning are proposed to 
address unmet needs of people treated for cancer. We tested whether HNA and care 
planning by an allied health professional improved cancer-specific quality of 
life for women following curative treatment for stage I-III gynaecological 
cancer.
METHODS: Consecutive women were invited to participate in a randomised 
controlled study (HNA and care planning vs usual care) at a UK cancer centre. 
Data were collected by questionnaire at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The outcomes 
were 6-month change in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (version 3), global score 
(primary) and, in EORTC subscales, generic quality of life and self-efficacy 
(secondary). The study was blinded for data management and analysis. Differences 
in outcomes were compared between groups. Health service utilisation and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (from Short Form-6) were gathered for a 
cost-effectiveness analysis. Thematic analysis was used to interpret data from 
an exit interview.
RESULTS: 150 women consented (75 per group); 10 undertook interviews. For 124 
participants (61 intervention, 63 controls) with complete data, no statistically 
significant differences were seen between groups in the primary endpoint. The 
majority of those interviewed reported important personal gains they attributed 
to the intervention, which reflected trends to improvement seen in EORTC 
functional and symptom scales. Economic analysis suggests a 62% probability of 
cost-effectiveness at a £30 000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: Care plan development with an allied health professional is 
cost-effective, acceptable and useful for some women treated for stage I-III 
gynaecological cancer. We recommend its introduction early in the pathway to 
support person-centred care.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are well-known accelerants of aging, but, 
paradoxically, we show that physiological levels of ROS extend life span in 
pupae of the moth Helicoverpa armigera, resulting in the dormant state of 
diapause. This developmental switch appears to operate through a variant of the 
conventional insulin-signaling pathway, as evidenced by the facts that Akt, 
p-Akt, and PRMT1 are elevated by ROS, but not insulin, and that high levels of 
p-Akt fail to phosphorylate FoxO through PRMT1-mediated methylation. These 
results suggest a distinct signaling pathway culminating in the elevation of 
FoxO, which in turn promotes the extension of life span characteristic of 
diapause.

Recent scientific publications suggest that human longevity records stopped 
increasing. Our finding that the mortality of centenarians has not decreased 
noticeably in recent decades (despite a significant mortality decline in younger 
age groups) is consistent with this suggestion. However, there is no convincing 
evidence that we have reached the limit of human life span. The future of human 
longevity is not fixed and will depend on human efforts to extend life span.

Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases: Current and Emerging Therapeutics.

Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, 
United States.

Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) result from defects in genes affecting 
the immune and other systems in many and varied ways (1, 2). Until the last few 
years, treatments have been largely supportive, with the exception of bone 
marrow transplantation. However, recent advances in immunobiology, genetics, and 
the explosion of discovery and commercialization of biologic modifiers have 
drastically altered the landscape and opportunities in clinical immunology. 
Therapeutic options and life expectancy of PID patients have also improved 
dramatically, in large part as a result of better prevention and treatment of 
infections as well as better understanding and treatment of autoimmune 
complications (3). As early-life infection-related mortality declines we should 
anticipate the emergence of other conditions that were previously not 
appreciated, including malignancies and degenerative disorders unmasked by 
increasing longevity (4). The genomic revolution has identified literally 
hundreds of new genetic etiologies of immune dysfunction, many of which are or 
will soon be eligible for targeted therapies. These emerging immunomodulatory 
agents represent new therapeutic options in PIDs (5).

BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have a shorter life 
expectancy and higher mortality rate and more often suffer from various physical 
and mental disorders (WHO: 3-4 times more often than the general population). 
Obesity is an important risk factor for various disorders. This cross-sectional 
study examined the body weight and its risk factors in a clinical population of 
adults with ID.
METHODS: The prevalence of underweight, normal weight, and overweight was 
determined using the body mass index (BMI) for 633 patients of an outpatient 
clinic for people with ID and mental disorders. A multiple logistic regression 
analysis was used to assess factors for alterations in body weight.
RESULTS: Approximately one out of two men and two out of three women with ID and 
mental disorders were overweight. Adults with mild and moderate ID, female 
gender, increasing age, Down's syndrome, behavioral disorders, and a less 
supported living situation were associated with a higher rate of obesity. People 
with dementia and autism spectrum disorders showed a lower rate of obesity.
CONCLUSION: Young women with ID and mental disorders were particularly at risk 
for obesity. The respective factors may support the development of specific 
prevention programs to reduce the risk of overweight and thereby lead to better 
mental and physical health in people with ID.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar discectomy has been shown to be clinically beneficial in 
numerous studies for appropriately selected patients. Some patients, however, 
undergo revision discectomy, with previously reported estimates of revisions 
ranging from 5.1% to 7.9%. No study to date has been able to precisely quantify 
the rate of revision surgery over numerous years on a national scale.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: We performed a survival analysis for lumbar discectomy on a 
national scale using a life-table analysis to answer the following questions: 
(1) What is the rate of revision discectomy on a national scale over 5 to 7 
years for patients undergoing primary discectomy alone? (2) Are there 
differences in revision discectomy rates based on age of patient, region of the 
country, or the payer type?
METHODS: The Medicare 5% National Sample Administrative Database (SAF5) and a 
large national database from Humana Inc (HORTHO) were used to catalog the number 
of patients undergoing a lumbar discectomy. Both of these databases have been 
cited in numerous peer-reviewed publications during the previous 5 years and 
routinely are audited by PearlDiver Inc. We identified patients using relevant 
ICD-9 codes and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, including ICD-9 
72210 (lumbar disc displacement) for disc herniation. We used appropriate CPT 
codes to identify patients who had a lumbar discectomy. We analyzed patients 
undergoing additional surgery including those who had repeat discectomy 
(CPT-63042: laminotomy, reexploration single interspace, lumbar) and patients 
who had additional more-extensive decompressive procedures with or without 
fusion after their primary procedure. Revision surgery rates were calculated for 
patients 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years and for each 
database (Humana Inc and Medicare). Patients from the two databases also were 
analyzed based on four distinct geographic regions in the United States where 
their surgery occurred. There were a total of 7520 patients who underwent a 
lumbar discectomy for an intervertebral disc displacement with at least 5 years 
of followup in the HORTHO and SAF5 databases. We used cumulative incidence of 
revision surgery to estimate the survivorship of these patients.
RESULTS: In the HORTHO (2613 patients) and SAF5 (4907 patients) databases, 147 
patients (5.6%; 95% CI, 1.8%-9.2%) and 305 patients (6.2%; 95% CI, 3.5%-8.9%) 
had revision surgery at 7 years after the index discectomy respectively. 
Survival analysis showed survival rates greater than 93% (95% CI, 91%-98%) for 
all of the cohorts for a primary discectomy up to 7 years after the surgery. The 
survivorship was lower for patients younger than 65 years (93% [95% CI, 87%-99%, 
1016 of 1091] versus 95% [95% CI, 90%-100%, 1450 of 1522], p = 0.02). When 
nondiscectomy lumbar surgeries were included, the survivorship of patients 
younger than 65 years remained lower (83% [95% CI, 76%-89%, 902 of 1091] versus 
87% [95% CI, 82%-92%, 1324 of 1522], p = 0.02). There was no difference in 
revision discectomy rates across geographic regions (p = 0.41) at 7 years. 
Similarly, there was no difference in additional nondiscectomy lumbar surgery 
rates (p = 0.68) across geographic regions at 7 years. There was no difference 
in survivorship rates between patients covered by Medicare (94% [95% CI, 
91%-97%], 4602 of 4907) versus Humana Inc (94% [95% CI, 90%-98%], 2466 of 2613) 
(p = 0.31).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows rates of cumulative survival after an index lumbar 
discectomy with revision discectomy as the endpoint. We hope these data allow 
physicians to offer accurate advice to patients regarding the risk of revision 
surgery for patients of all ages during 5 to 7 years after their index procedure 
to enhance shared decision making in spinal surgery. These data also will help 
public policymakers and accountable care organizations accurately allocate 
scarce resources to patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

EQ-5D is becoming the preferred instrument to measure health-state utilities 
involved in health technology assessment. The objective of this study is to 
assess the state of EQ-5D research in musculoskeletal disorders in 8 Central and 
Eastern European countries and to provide a meta-analysis of EQ-5D index scores. 
Original research articles published in any language between Jan 2000 and Sept 
2016 were included, if they reported any EQ-5D outcome from at least two 
musculoskeletal patients from Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland, Romania, Slovakia, or Slovenia. Risk of bias was assessed with the 
Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Twenty-nine articles (5992 patients) were 
included on rheumatoid arthritis (n = 7), osteoporosis (n = 5), chronic pain 
(n = 5), osteoarthritis (n = 4), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 2), psoriatic 
arthritis (n = 2), total hip replacement (n = 2), and scleroderma (n = 2). Low 
back pain was under-represented, while studies in neck pain, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, gout, and childhood disorders were lacking. EQ-5D index scores 
were reported in 24 studies, while the version of the instrument and the 
value-set was not specified in 41% and 46% of the articles, respectively. 
Meta-analysis was performed on 24 disease states involving 6876 observation 
points. Intervention effect was reported in 22 subgroups, out of which risk of 
bias was low in 41%. This review provides recommendations to improve reporting 
standards of EQ-5D results and highlights potential areas for future research. 
Coordinated research in conditions with greatest public health impact as well as 
a development of a regional value-set could provide locally relevant 
health-state utilities that are transferable among countries within the region.

The article presents a methodical approach for prediction of life expectancy for 
people diagnosed with prostate cancer based on the kinetic theory of aging of 
living systems. The life expectancy is calculated by solving the differential 
equation for the rate of aging for three different stage of life - «normal» 
life, life with prostate cancer and life after combination therapy for prostate 
cancer. The mathematical model of aging for each stage of life has its own 
parameters identified by the statistical analysis of healthcare data from the 
Zharinov's databank and Rosstat CDR NES databank. The core of the methodical 
approach is the statistical correlation between growth rate of the prostate 
specific antigen level (PSA-level) or the PSA doubling time (PSA DT) before 
therapy, and lifespan: the higher the PSA DT is, the greater lifespan. The 
patients were grouped under the «fast PSA DT» and «slow PSA DT» categories. The 
satisfactory matching between calculations and experiment is shown. The 
prediction error of group life expectancy is due to the completeness and 
reliability of the main data source. A detailed monitoring of the basic health 
indicators throughout the each person life in each analyzed group is required. 
The absence of this particular information makes it impossible to predict the 
individual life expectancy.

Publisher: На основе кинетической теории старения биологических систем 
разработана методика прогнозирования продолжительности жизни (ПЖ) у пациентов 
после комбинированного лечения рака предстательной железы. ПЖ (время дожития) 
рассчитывается как решение дифференциального уравнения скорости старения 
пациента, учитывающего основные этапы жизни, начиная с рождения, — «нормальную» 
жизнь и жизнь с установленным диагнозом рака предстательной железы (в процессе 
лечения и после его завершения). В основе идеологии обсуждаемой методики — 
установленная статистическая корреляция между скоростью увеличения уровня 
простатического специфического антигена (время его удвоения — ВУПСА) до терапии 
и временем дожития — чем выше ВУПСА, тем больше ПЖ. Адекватность прогноза 
продемонстрирована удовлетворительным согласием расчетов с экспериментальными 
данными работы по выживаемости когорт пациентов, сгруппированных с учетом 
«быстрых» и «медленных» значений ВУПСА. Погрешность математического прогноза 
«групповой» ПЖ обусловливается полнотой и надежностью основных исходных 
медико-демографических данных и требует детального мониторинга основных 
показателей здоровья на протяжении всей жизни каждого человека в анализируемой 
группе. Отсутствие такой детальной информации для отдельной личности 
обусловливает невозможность прогноза ПЖ для конкретного физического лица.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with chronic neck pain can present with 
disability, low quality of life, psychological factors and clinical symptoms. It 
is unclear whether patients with a traumatic onset differ from those with a 
non-traumatic onset, by having more complex and severe symptoms. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate the clinical presentation of chronic neck pain 
patients with and without traumatic onset by examining cervical mobility, 
sensorimotor function, cervical muscle performance and pressure pain threshold 
in addition to the following self-reported characteristics: quality of life, 
neck pain and function, kinesiophobia, depression, and pain bothersomeness.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 200 participants with chronic neck 
pain: 120 with traumatic onset and 80 with non-traumatic onset. Participants 
were recruited from physiotherapy clinics in primary and secondary health care. 
For participants to be included, they were required to be at least 18 years of 
age, have had neck pain for at least 6 months, and experienced neck-related 
activity limitation as determined by a score of at least 10 on the Neck 
Disability Index. We conducted the following clinical tests of cervical range of 
motion, gaze stability, eye movement, cranio-cervical flexion, cervical 
extensors, and pressure pain threshold. The participants completed the following 
questionnaires: physical and mental component summary of the Short Form Health 
Survey, EuroQol-5D, Neck Disability Index, Patient-Specific Functional Scale, 
Pain Bothersomeness, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and TAMPA scale of 
kinesiophobia. The level of significance for all analyses was defined as p<0.01. 
Differences between groups for the continuous data were determined using either 
a Student's t-test or Mann Whitney U test.
RESULTS: In both groups, the majority of the participants were female 
(approximately 75%). Age, educational level, working situation and sleeping 
patterns were similar in both groups. The traumatic group had symptoms for a 
shorter duration (88 vs. 138 months p=0.001). Participants in the traumatic 
group showed worse results on all measures compared with those in the 
non-traumatic group, significantly on neck muscle function (cervical extension 
mobility p=0.005, cranio-cervical flexion test p=0.007, cervical extensor test 
p=0.006) and cervical pressure pain threshold bilateral (p=0.002/0.004), as well 
on self-reported function (Neck Disability Index p=0.001 and Patient-Specific 
Functional Scale p=0.007), mental quality of life (mental component summary of 
the Short Form Health Survey p=0.004 and EuroQol-5D p=0.001) and depression 
(Beck Depression Inventory-II p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed significant differences between chronic neck pain 
patients when differentiated into groups based on their onset of pain. However, 
no specific clinical test or self-reported characteristic could differentiate 
between the groups at an individual patient level.
IMPLICATIONS: Pressure pain threshold tests, cervical muscle performance tests 
and patient-reported characteristics about self-perceived function and 
psychological factors may assist in profiling chronic neck pain patients. The 
need for more intensive management of those with a traumatic onset compared with 
those with a non-traumatic onset should be examined further.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Identification of psychosocial variables may influence 
treatment outcome. The objective of this study was to prospectively examine 
whether psychosocial variables, in addition to clinical variables (pain, 
functioning, general health, previous neck pain, comorbidity), are predictive 
factors for treatment outcome (i.e. global perceived effect, functioning and 
pain) in patients with sub-acute and chronic non-specific neck pain undergoing 
physical therapy or manual therapy. Psychosocial factors included treatment 
outcome expectancy and treatment credibility, health locus of control, and fear 
avoidance beliefs.
METHODS: This study reports a secondary analysis of a primary care-based 
pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Potential predictors were measured at 
baseline and outcomes, in 181 patients, at 7 weeks and 26 weeks.
RESULTS: Hierarchical logistic regression models showed that treatment outcome 
expectancy predicted outcome success, in addition to clinical and demographic 
variables. Expectancy explained additional variance, ranging from 6% (pain) to 
17% (functioning) at 7 weeks, and 8% (pain) to 16% (functioning) at 26 weeks. 
Locus of control and fear avoidance beliefs did not add significantly to 
predicting outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study we conclude that outcome 
expectancy, in patients with non-specific sub-acute and chronic neck pain, has 
additional predictive value for treatment success above and beyond clinical and 
demographic variables.
IMPLICATIONS: Psychological processes, health perceptions and how these factors 
relate to clinical variables may be important for treatment decision making 
regarding therapeutic options for individual patients.

INTRODUCTION: Recent ILAE classification defined focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) 
patients with accompanying epileptic lesions as a separate group. We 
investigated data of patients with sole FCD lesions regarding long-term seizure 
outcome and different characteristics of FCD type 1 and type 2 patients.
METHODS: Eighty children and adult patients underwent surgery for FCD were 
included to the analysis of factors differentiating FCD type 1 and type 2 groups 
and their effect on long-term outcome.
RESULTS: FCD type 2 patients had earlier epilepsy onset (8.1 vs. 6.1 years. 
p=0.019) and underwent surgery younger than type 1 (18.2 vs. 23.7 years. 
p=0.034). FCD type 2 patients were more prominently MR positive (77.8% vs. 
53.8%. p=0.029), which increased within FCD type 2 group as patients become 
younger (p=0.028). FCD Type 1 lesions showed mostly multilobar extension and FCD 
type 2 mostly located in frontal lobe. Seizure freedom was achieved in 65.4% of 
FCD type 1 patients and 70.4% of FCD type 2 patients. Seven patients had 
permanent de novo neurological deficits. Mean follow-up time was 5.5 years 
(Range: 1-11 years).
CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention in carefully selected patients may facilitate 
favorable seizure outcome leading to better quality of life. FCD type 1 and type 
2 groups present with evident differences, which may promote medical and 
surgical management of these pathologies.

Peptide-binding MHC proteins are thought the most variable across the human 
population; the extreme MHC polymorphism observed is functionally important and 
results from constrained divergent evolution. MHCs have vital functions in 
immunology and homeostasis: cell surface MHC class I molecules report cell 
status to CD8+ T cells, NKT cells and NK cells, thus playing key roles in 
pathogen defence, as well as mediating smell recognition, mate choice, Adverse 
Drug Reactions, and transplantation rejection. MHC peptide specificity falls 
into several supertypes exhibiting commonality of binding. It seems likely that 
other supertypes exist relevant to other functions. Since comprehensive 
experimental characterization is intractable, structure-based bioinformatics is 
the only viable solution. We modelled functional MHC proteins by homology and 
used calculated Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics projected from the top surface 
of the MHC as multi-dimensional descriptors, analysing them using 
state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering algorithms. 
We were able to recover the 3 MHC loci as separate clusters and identify clear 
sub-groups within them, vindicating unequivocally our choice of both data 
representation and clustering strategy. We expect this approach to make a 
profound contribution to the study of MHC polymorphism and its functional 
consequences, and, by extension, other burgeoning structural systems, such as 
GPCRs.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy for people with intellectual disability 
is resulting in greater need for end-of-life care services. However, limited 
knowledge is available regarding what barriers to accessing end-of-life care 
support are evident, particularly comparatively across rural and metropolitan 
locations.
METHODS: Focus group interviews were undertaken with 35 direct-care staff from 
four rural and two metropolitan locations. A semistructured interview guide was 
used, with a focus on health service access. All focus group data were 
independently transcribed, with thematic analysis then performed.
RESULTS: Frequency analysis identified 262 statements relating to health 
services access. Thematic analysis identified four key areas of "isolation," 
"support from doctors," "general health support access" and "internal staffing 
issues."
CONCLUSIONS: Improved access to end-of-life services is urgently required across 
both rural and metropolitan areas. Development of specialist training and 
support models for both disability and general healthcare staff may assist to 
reduce some identified barriers.

RATIONALE AND AIMS: Meaning is an integral aspect of life that drives 
behaviours, actions and emotions. Perception of pain is believed to be affected 
by the meaning of pain. Our primary aim was to investigate and discuss the 
determinants of meaning in acute pain following a traumatic injury.
METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN: Using the Interpretive Description approach, a method of 
qualitative inquiry, 13 adults hospitalised due to their accidental injuries 
were recruited. Semi-structured interviews that were digitally recorded were 
used to collect the data. Ethical approval was received by our local Health 
Research Ethics Board, and all relevant ethical standards were followed as 
outlined in the approved ethics proposal.
FINDINGS: The three primary determinants of meaning during an acute pain event, 
or the experience of acute pain include permanence of injuries, incongruence of 
care quality, and personal responses to the injury and care received. Although 
the permanence of an injury is lasting, we did not find any emotional response 
to this fact while the participants were hospitalised. The emotion 
characterising the personal response to the perceived poor quality of hospital 
care received was anxiety.
CONCLUSION: Both the technical and personal components of healthcare quality 
have the potential to increase the perception of pain. Meanings in an acute pain 
event are primarily related to the determinants of incongruent care and the 
personal response to that determinant: anxiety.

BACKGROUND: Increase of the expression of γ-globin gene and high production of 
fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in β-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as 
associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease. The search for 
HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, BCL11A and MYB polymorphisms) 
has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify β-thalassemia patients 
with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of 
blood, response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea).
METHODS: Aγ-globin gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a 
total of 75 β-thalassemia patients, including 31 β039/β039, 33 β039/β+IVSI-110, 
9 β+IVSI-110/β+IVSI-110, one β0IVSI-1/β+IVSI-6 and one β039/β+IVSI-6.
RESULTS: The results show that the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in 
β-thalassemia patients in the 5'UTR sequence (+25) of the Aγ-globin gene, known 
to affect the LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone) 
binding site 5'-GGTTAT-3'. This Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphism is associated with the 
Gγ-globin-XmnI polymorphism and both are linked with the β039-globin gene, but 
not with the β+IVSI-110-globin gene. In agreement with the expectation that this 
mutation alters the LYAR binding activity, we found that the Aγ(+25 G->A) and 
Gγ-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor 
cells isolated from β039/β039 thalassemia patients.
CONCLUSIONS: As a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in 
β-thalassemia the Gγ-globin-XmnI/Aγ-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under 
genetic linkage with β0-thalassemia mutations, but not with the β+-thalassemia 
mutation here studied (i.e. β+IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination has 
been selected within the population of β0-thalassemia patients, due to 
functional association with high HbF. Here we describe the characterization of 
the rs368698783 (+25 G->A) polymorphism of the Aγ-globin gene associated in β039 
thalassemia patients with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells.

OBJECTIVE: Conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for long 
lesions in the below-the-knee (BTK) arteries in patients presenting with 
critical limb ischemia (CLI) has high restenosis rates at 1 year. Our goal is to 
evaluate whether paclitaxel drug-eluting balloons (DEB) have higher 1 year 
primary patency rates compared to conventional PTA.
METHODS: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial that was 
conducted from June 2013 to December 2015. The aim of the study was to compare 1 
year primary patency rates of DEB and PTA in BTK arteries in CLI patients. 
Inclusion criteria were patients presenting with CLI (Rutherford class 4 or 
greater), stenosis or occlusion ≥30 mm of at least one tibial artery, and 
agreement to 12-month evaluation. Exclusion criteria were life expectancy <1 
year, allergy to paclitaxel, and contraindication to combined antiplatelet 
treatment. Follow-up was performed by clinical assessment, ankle brachial 
pressure index, Doppler ultrasound imaging, and conventional angiogram if 
indicated. Primary end point was 1 year primary patency, and secondary end 
points were target lesion revascularization (TLR) and major amputation. 
Statistical analysis was performed using Fischer's exact test.
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients with 106 lesions in the BTK arteries were 
enrolled in this study. One year primary patency was achieved in 26 (65%) and 
seven (17%) in the DEB and PTA groups (P = 0.006), respectively. TLR was 
performed in nine lesions (23%) and 29 lesions (71%) in DEB and PTA groups (P = 
0.009), respectively. Major amputations occurred in one limb (2%) and two limbs 
(4%) in DEB and PTA groups (P = 0.6), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Paclitaxel DEB has significantly higher 1 year primary patency rate 
associated with significantly less TLR than conventional PTA, following 
endovascular recanalization of BTK arteries in patients presenting with CLI.
