BACKGROUND: Tourniquet-induced ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) has been related 
to postoperative muscle atrophy through mechanisms involving protein 
synthesis/breakdown, cellular metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
apoptosis. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) could protect skeletal muscle against 
I/R injury. This study aims to determine the underlying mechanisms of IPC and 
its effect on muscle strength after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: Twenty-four TKA patients were randomized to receive either sham IPC or 
IPC (3 cycles of 5-min ischemia followed by 5-min reperfusion). Vastus medialis 
muscle biopsies were collected at 30 ​min after tourniquet (TQ) inflation and 
the onset of reperfusion. Western blot analysis was performed in muscle protein 
for 4-HNE, SOD2, TNF-ɑ, IL-6, p-Drp1ser616, Drp1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Opa1, PGC-1ɑ, ETC 
complex I-V, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3, and caspase-3. Clinical outcomes 
including isokinetic muscle strength and quality of life were evaluated pre- and 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: IPC significantly increased Mfn2 (2.0 ​± ​0.2 vs 1.2 ​± ​0.1, 
p ​= ​0.001) and Opa1 (2.9 ​± ​0.3 vs 1.9 ​± ​0.2, p ​= ​0.005) proteins 
expression at the onset of reperfusion, compared to the ischemic phase. There 
were no differences in 4-HNE, SOD2, TNF-ɑ, IL-6, p-Drp1ser616/Drp1, Mfn1, 
PGC-1ɑ, ETC complex I-V, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 
expression between the ischemic and reperfusion periods, or between the groups. 
Clinically, postoperative peak torque for knee extension significantly reduced 
in the sham IPC group (-16.6 [-29.5, -3.6] N.m, p ​= ​0.020), while that in the 
IPC group was preserved (-4.7 [-25.3, 16.0] N.m, p ​= ​0.617).
CONCLUSION: In TKA with TQ application, IPC preserved postoperative quadriceps 
strength and prevented TQ-induced I/R injury partly by enhancing mitochondrial 
fusion proteins in the skeletal muscle.
THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: Mitochondrial fusion is a potential 
underlying mechanism of IPC in preventing skeletal muscle I/R injury. IPC 
applied before TQ-induced I/R preserved postoperative quadriceps muscle strength 
after TKA.

Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk for numerous cutaneous 
conditions that fall within four categories: pre-neoplastic, neoplastic, 
infectious, or idiopathic. Many of these diseases can be attributed to 
immunosuppressive medications, including mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, 
azathioprine, tacrolimus, or glucocorticoids. Iatrogenic lessening of the immune 
system places the patient at risk of malignancies, opportunistic infections, 
immune-mediated dermatoses, and adverse effects of medications. As the life 
expectancy of patients with solid organ transplants continues to increase, 
dermatologists and transplant physicians must stay abreast of this spectrum of 
dermatologic conditions, their respective prognoses, prevention, mitigation, and 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Children hospitalised with severe anaemia in malaria-endemic areas 
are at a high risk of dying or being readmitted within six months of discharge. 
A trial in Kenya and Uganda showed that three months of postdischarge malaria 
chemoprevention (PDMC) with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) 
substantially reduced this risk. The World Health Organization recently included 
PDMC in its malaria chemoprevention guidelines. We conducted a 
cost-effectiveness analysis of community-based PDMC delivery (supplying all 
three PDMC-DP courses to caregivers at discharge to administer at home), 
facility-based PDMC delivery (monthly dispensing of PDMC-DP at the hospital), 
and the standard of care (no PDMC).
METHODS: We combined data from two recently completed trials; one 
placebo-controlled trial in Kenya and Uganda collecting efficacy data (May 6, 
2016 until November 15, 2018; n=1049), and one delivery mechanism trial from 
Malawi collecting adherence data (March 24, 2016 until October 3, 2018; n=375). 
Cost data were collected alongside both trials. Three Markov decision models, 
one each for Malawi, Kenya, and Uganda, were used to compute incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios expressed as costs per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to account for uncertainty.
FINDINGS: Both PDMC strategies were cost-saving in each country, meaning less 
costly and more effective in increasing health-adjusted life expectancy than the 
standard of care. The estimated incremental cost savings for community-based 
PDMC compared to the standard of care were US$ 22·10 (Malawi), 38·52 (Kenya), 
and 26·23 (Uganda) per child treated. The incremental effectiveness gain using 
either PDMC strategy varied between 0·3 and 0·4 QALYs. Community-based PDMC was 
less costly and more effective than facility-based PDMC. These results remained 
robust in sensitivity analyses.
INTERPRETATION: PDMC under implementation conditions is cost-saving. Caregivers 
receiving PDMC at discharge is a cost-effective delivery strategy for 
implementation in malaria-endemic southeastern African settings.

The main strategy for the treatment of epilepsy is the use of pharmacological 
agents known as antiseizure medication (ASM). These drugs control the seizure 
onset and improves the life expectancy and quality of life of patients. Several 
ASMs are contraindicated during pregnancy, due to a potential teratogen risk. 
For this reason, the pharmacological treatments of the pregnant Women with 
Epilepsy (WWE) need comprehensive analyses to reduce fetal risk during the first 
trimester of pregnancy. The mechanisms by which ASM are teratogens are still 
under study and scientists in the field, propose different hypotheses. One of 
them, which will be addressed in this review, corresponds to the potential 
alteration of ASM on ion channels and proteins involved in relevant signaling 
and cellular responses (i.e., migration, differentiation) during embryonic 
development. The actual information related to the action of ASM and its 
possible targets it is poorly understood. In this review, we will focus on 
describing the eventual presence of some ion channels and synaptic proteins of 
the neurotransmitter signaling pathways present during early neural development, 
which could potentially interacting as targets of ASM. This information leads to 
elucidate whether these drugs would have the ability to affect critical 
signaling during periods of neural development that in turn could explain the 
fetal malformations observed by the use of ASM during pregnancy.

review.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) constitute a global problem for 
humans and animals. Knowledge related to the spatial distribution of various 
species of vectors and their relationship with the environment where they 
develop is essential to understand the current risk of VBDs and for planning 
surveillance and control strategies in the face of future threats. This study 
aimed to identify models, variables, and factors that may influence the 
emergence and resurgence of VBDs and how these factors can affect spatial local 
and global distribution patterns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was designed based on identification, 
screening, selection, and inclusion described in the research protocols 
according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses guide. A literature search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, 
Scopus, and SciELO using the following search strategy: Article type Original 
research, Language: English, Publishing period: 2010-2020, Search terms: Spatial 
analysis, spatial models, VBDs, climate, ecologic, life cycle, climate 
variability, vector-borne, vector, zoonoses, species distribution model, and 
niche model used in different combinations with "AND" and "OR."
RESULTS: The complexity of the interactions between climate, biotic/abiotic 
variables, and non-climate factors vary considerably depending on the type of 
disease and the particular location. VBDs are among the most studied types of 
illnesses related to climate and environmental aspects due to their high disease 
burden, extended presence in tropical and subtropical areas, and high 
susceptibility to climate and environment variations.
CONCLUSION: It is difficult to generalize our knowledge of VBDs from a 
geospatial point of view, mainly because every case is inherently independent in 
variable selection, geographic coverage, and temporal extension. It can be 
inferred from predictions that as global temperatures increase, so will the 
potential trend toward extreme events. Consequently, it will become a public 
health priority to determine the role of climate and environmental variations in 
the incidence of infectious diseases. Our analysis of the information, as 
conducted in this work, extends the review beyond individual cases to generate a 
series of relevant observations applicable to different models.

The genesis of the teacher habitus-a longitudinal study with Swiss primary 
teacher students.

The teacher habitus concept offers a theoretical figure for the classification 
and interpretation of professionalization processes-especially from a 
vocational-biographical perspective. Milieu of origin and school biography are 
important for the genesis of the teacher's habitus, since images of school life 
are already created in them, which are relevant for later professional action in 
the form of implicit orientations and explicit ideas. In the article, interview 
data from a longitudinal survey (3t) of primary teacher-students (N = 24), which 
were analyzed using the documentary method, are related to this concept. It 
turns out that the school biography is used as an argument for the choice of 
study, and frames the experience in the first internship. In the further course 
of the study, the professional requirements are increasingly classified against 
the background of one's own skills and their concepts of the teaching 
profession. It can be seen, that students deal with requirements and arising 
crises and address their practice teacher in a very diverse way. Types of 
students and their habitus were identified at each time of the survey. For t2 
(end of 2nd year) these were distinguished as: delimitation, extension, 
development, exploration and probation. On the basis of two contrastive case 
analyzes of the types "extension" and "development" it is shown how important 
one's own school experience is and how differently the genesis of a teacher's 
habitus takes place. The results illustrate the relevance of a (school) 
biographical reflection that should be given space to enable future teachers to 
access their implicit, action-guiding orientations and to make their own student 
habitus accessible to reflection.

Publisher: Das Lehrerhabituskonzept bietet für die Einordnung und Interpretation 
lehrberuflicher Professionalisierungsprozesse eine gehaltvolle Theoriefigur. Dem 
Herkunftsmilieu und der Schulbiografie werden für die Genese des Lehrerhabitus 
Bedeutung zugewiesen, da in ihnen bereits Bilder des Schulischen angelegt 
werden, die für das spätere berufliche Handeln in Form impliziter Orientierungen 
sowie expliziter Vorstellungen relevant sind. Im Beitrag werden Interviewdaten 
aus einer Längsschnittbefragung (3t) von Primarschulstudierenden (N = 24), die 
mit der Dokumentarischen Methode analysiert wurden, an diese Konzeption 
angelegt. Es zeigt sich, dass die Schulbiografie insbesondere beim 
Studieneintritt als Argumentationsfolie für die Studienwahl herangezogen wird 
und das Erleben im 1. Praktikum rahmt. Im weiteren Studienverlauf werden 
zunehmend die beruflichen Anforderungen vor dem Hintergrund eigener Fähigkeiten 
und Berufsbilder eingeordnet. Anforderungen und sich konstituierende Krisen 
sowie die Adressierung der Praxislehrperson ist sehr divers. Je 
Erhebungszeitpunkt wurden Studierendentypen und ausbildungsbezogene Habitus 
identifiziert. Für t2 wurden diese unterschieden als: 1. Abgrenzung, 
2. Erweiterung, 3. Entwicklung, 4. Erkundung und 5. Bewährung. Anhand zweier 
kontrastiver Fallanalysen der Typen „Erweiterung“ und „Entwicklung“ wird 
aufgezeigt, welche Bedeutung der eigenen Schulerfahrung zukommt und wie 
unterschiedlich sich die Genese eines Lehrerhabitus vollzieht. Die Ergebnisse 
verdeutlichen die Relevanz einer (schul-)biografischen Reflexion, die Raum geben 
sollte, um zukünftigen Lehrpersonen Zugang zu ihren impliziten, 
handlungsleitenden Orientierungen zu ermöglichen und den eigenen 
Studierendenhabitus einer Reflexion zugänglich zu machen.

Life expectancy and human capital: New empirical evidence.

Vu TV(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Business and Economics, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.

This paper re-examines a well-established hypothesis postulating that life 
expectancy augments incentives for human capital accumulation, leading to global 
income differences. A major distinguishing feature of the current study is to 
estimate heterogeneous panel data models under a common factor framework, which 
explicitly accounts for parameter heterogeneity, unobserved common factors 
(UCFs), and variables' non-stationarity. In sharp contrast to most previous 
studies, I find that the impact of health improvements on human capital 
accumulation turns out to be imprecisely estimated at conventionally accepted 
levels of statistical significance. I demonstrate that conventional estimates of 
the educational returns to rising longevity are derived from estimating 
misspecified models at least partially due to parameter heterogeneity and the 
presence of UCFs.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a systematic review of the literature and knowledge base 
of cost per quality-adjusted life year of physical rehabilitation and care of 
older persons after hip fracture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A research librarian assisted in searching 9 databases (14 
May to 27 May 2021), with exclusion of studies on cognitively impaired or 
institutionalized individuals. A stepwise selection process was conducted by 2 
authors, study quality was assessed using Drummond et al.'s checklist, and 
comparison between different countries was assessed using Welte et al.'s 
checklist.
RESULTS: Three studies were included, which employed 3 different interventions 
initiated at 3 different postoperative time-points. One high-quality study 
demonstrated that comprehensive geriatric assessment was cost-effective compared 
with coordinated care. The other 2 studies did not find the interventions 
studied to be cost-effective, and both studies were deemed to be of moderate 
quality.
CONCLUSION: The body of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of physical 
rehabilitation and care after hip fracture is limited and heterogeneous, with 
only 1 high-quality study. Thus, stakeholders perform decision-making with a 
limited knowledge base of the cost-effectiveness of physical rehabilitation and 
care. We recommend researchers to assess cost-per-QALY.

OBJECTIVE: Integration of environmentally sustainable digital health 
interventions requires robust evaluation of their carbon emission life-cycle 
before implementation in healthcare. This scoping review surveys the evidence on 
available environmental assessment frameworks, methods, and tools to evaluate 
the carbon footprint of digital health interventions for environmentally 
sustainable healthcare.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid). PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL, 
Web of Science, Scopus (which indexes IEEE Xplore, Springer Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science and ACM databases), Compendex, and Inspec databases were 
searched with no time or language constraints. The Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA_SCR), Joanna Briggs Scoping 
Review Framework, and template for intervention description and replication 
(TiDiER) checklist were used to structure and report the findings.
RESULTS: From 3299 studies screened, data was extracted from 13 full-text 
studies. No standardised methods or validated tools were identified to 
systematically determine the environmental sustainability of a digital health 
intervention over its full life-cycle from conception to realisation. Most 
studies (n = 8) adapted publicly available carbon calculators to estimate 
telehealth travel-related emissions. Others adapted these tools to examine the 
environmental impact of electronic health records (n = 2), e-prescriptions and 
e-referrals (n = 1), and robotic surgery (n = 1). One study explored optimising 
the information system electricity consumption of telemedicine. No validated 
systems-based approach to evaluation and validation of digital health 
interventions could be identified.
CONCLUSION: There is a need to develop standardised, validated methods and tools 
for healthcare environments to assist stakeholders to make informed decisions 
about reduction of carbon emissions from digital health interventions.

PURPOSE: To evaluate meibomian gland loss and its possible association with 
disease duration and activity in Juvenile Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (JSLE) 
patients' without dry eye symptoms or signs.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
METHODS: Ten eyes of 10 JSLE patients were evaluated using the Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and 14 eyes of 14 healthy controls 
were also enrolled. Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and 
Schirmer I test were performed. Lid margin score, meibum quality and 
expressibility scores were evaluated. Noninvasive first breakup time (NIF-BUT) 
and noninvasive average breakup time (NIAvg-BUT), meibomian gland dropout area 
(MGDA) and meibography scores were evaluated using non-contact meibography 
(Sirius; CSO).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the JSLE patients and the 
healthy controls in the OSDI, NIF-BUT, NIAvg-BUT and Schirmer I tests. Also lid 
margin score, meibum quality and expressibility scores were not significantly 
different between the groups. However, JSLE patients had increased upper and 
lower lid MGDA and increased upper lid, lower lid and total meibography scores 
compared to the healthy subjects. Furthermore, the duration of JSLE showed a 
high positive correlation with upper and lower lid MGDA and meibography scores.
CONCLUSION: Meibomian gland loss could be observed in JSLE patients with no 
clinical signs and symptoms of dry eye. Considering the longer life expectancy 
of children, the positive correlation of disease duration with the meibomian 
gland reveals the importance of routine eye examinations from the diagnosis of 
the disease.

Over the past millennia, life expectancy has drastically increased. While a mere 
25 years during Bronze and Iron ages, life expectancy in many European countries 
and in Japan is currently above 80 years. Such an increase in life expectancy is 
a result of improved diet, life style, and medical care. Yet, increased life 
span and aging also represent the most important non-modifiable risk factors for 
several pathologies including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative 
diseases, and cancer. In recent years, neutrophils have been implicated in all 
of these pathologies. Hence, this review provides an overview of how aging 
impacts neutrophil production and function and conversely how neutrophils drive 
aging-associated pathologies. Finally, we provide a perspective on how processes 
of neutrophil-driven pathologies in the context of aging can be targeted 
therapeutically.

The increase in life expectancy and emphasis on self-reliance for older adults 
are global phenomena. As such, living healthily in the community is considered a 
viable means of promoting successful and active aging. Existing knowledge 
indicates the prevalence of health illiteracy among the older population and the 
impact of poor health literacy on health outcomes and health care costs. 
Nevertheless, e-health literacy is a critical issue for a rapidly aging 
population in a technology-driven society. Intergenerational studies reported 
that older adults enjoy engaging with younger people and benefit from the social 
stimulation by improved social behaviours, intergenerational social network, and 
participation. An Intergenerational e-health Literacy Program (I-HeLP) is 
developed to draw upon the IT-savvy strength of the youth, and teach older 
adults to seek, understand and appraise health information from electronic 
sources and apply knowledge gained to address the health problem. I-HeLP is an 
evidence-based program, which provides comprehensive coverage on relevant 
health-related e-resources. I-HeLP aims to engage youth volunteers to teach 
older adults regarding e-health literacy, and enhance older adults’ sense of 
coherence, e-health literacy, physical and mental health, cognitive function, 
quality of life, and intergenerational communication. I-HeLP promotes social 
participation, health, and wellbeing of older adults, and empowers the younger 
generation to play an active role in society. Furthermore, I-HeLP aligns with 
the ‘Smart Nation’ initiative by the Singapore government to empower citizens to 
lead meaningful and fulfilled lives with the use of technology.

The prevalence of various cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in the different 
rheumatologic disorders is a very important topic. Each disease has a number of 
unique manifestations despite the fact that an overlap is present due to shared 
common risk factors, which may be related to the longer life expectancy of the 
recent therapeutic advances. A growing understanding of the role of inflammation 
and immune system in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis as well 
as the early detection of cardiovascular manifestations is due to the 
availability and use of sophisticated noninvasive cardiac and vascular 
diagnostic technology. Such discipline results in the detection of cardiac 
manifestation unique to each rheumatologic disorder. This was not possible 
previously due to short life expectancy, limited therapeutic interventions, 
vague understanding of pathological process for each disease, and the limited 
diagnostic resources.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patient reported outcomes improve after single 
stage versus two stage revision surgery for prosthetic joint infection of the 
hip, and to determine the cost effectiveness of these procedures.
DESIGN: Pragmatic, parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: High volume tertiary referral centres or orthopaedic units in the UK 
(n=12) and in Sweden (n=3), recruiting from 1 March 2015 to 19 December 2018.
PARTICIPANTS: 140 adults (aged ≥18 years) with a prosthetic joint infection of 
the hip who required revision (65 randomly assigned to single stage and 75 to 
two stage revision).
INTERVENTIONS: A computer generated 1:1 randomisation list stratified by 
hospital was used to allocate participants with prosthetic joint infection of 
the hip to a single stage or a two stage revision procedure.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary intention-to-treat outcome was pain, 
stiffness, and functional limitations 18 months after randomisation, measured by 
the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 
score. Secondary outcomes included surgical complications and joint infection. 
The economic evaluation (only assessed in UK participants) compared quality 
adjusted life years and costs between the randomised groups.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 71 years (standard deviation 9) and 51 
(36%) were women. WOMAC scores did not differ between groups at 18 months (mean 
difference 0.13 (95% confidence interval -8.20 to 8.46), P=0.98); however, the 
single stage procedure was better at three months (11.53 (3.89 to 19.17), 
P=0.003), but not from six months onwards. Intraoperative events occurred in 
five (8%) participants in the single stage group and 20 (27%) in the two stage 
group (P=0.01). At 18 months, nine (14%) participants in the single stage group 
and eight (11%) in the two stage group had at least one marker of possible 
ongoing infection (P=0.62). From the perspective of healthcare providers and 
personal social services, single stage revision was cost effective with an 
incremental net monetary benefit of £11 167 (95% confidence interval £638 to 
£21 696) at a £20 000 per quality adjusted life years threshold (£1.0; $1.1; 
€1.4).
CONCLUSIONS: At 18 months, single stage revision compared with two stage 
revision for prosthetic joint infection of the hip showed no superiority by 
patient reported outcome. Single stage revision had a better outcome at three 
months, fewer intraoperative complications, and was cost effective. Patients 
prefer early restoration of function, therefore, when deciding treatment, 
surgeons should consider patient preferences and the cost effectiveness of 
single stage surgery.

Natural processes continuously degrade a material's performance throughout its 
life cycle. An emerging class of synthetic self-healing polymers and composites 
possess property-retaining functions with the promise of longer lifetimes. But 
sustained in-service repair of structural fiber-reinforced composites remains 
unfulfilled due to material heterogeneity and thermodynamic barriers in commonly 
cross-linked polymer-matrix constituents. Overcoming these inherent challenges 
for mechanical self-recovery is vital to extend in-service operation and attain 
widespread adoption of such bioinspired structural materials. Here we transcend 
existing obstacles and report a fiber-composite capable of minute-scale and 
prolonged in situ healing - 100 cycles: an order of magnitude higher than prior 
studies. By 3D printing a mendable thermoplastic onto woven glass/carbon fiber 
reinforcement and co-laminating with electrically resistive heater interlayers, 
we achieve in situ thermal remending of internal delamination via dynamic bond 
re-association. Full fracture recovery occurs below the glass-transition 
temperature of the thermoset epoxy-matrix composite, thus preserving stiffness 
during and after repair. A discovery of chemically driven improvement in thermal 
remending of glass- over carbon-fiber composites is also revealed. The marked 
lifetime extension offered by this self-healing strategy mitigates costly 
maintenance, facilitates repair of difficult-to-access structures (e.g., 
wind-turbine blades), and reduces part replacement, thereby benefiting economy 
and environment.

BACKGROUND: In Belgium, a value set for children and adolescents for a generic 
health-related quality-of-life measure is not available. To inform drug pricing 
and make resource allocation decisions for children and adolescents, national 
tax-payers' preferences for youth health states should be known.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to obtain a value set for EQ-5D-Y-3L in Belgium, following 
the international youth valuation protocol for data collection.
METHODS: Composite Time Trade-Off interviews were conducted in a sample of 200 
adults, either face to face or via video conferencing. Another sample of 1000 
adults completed an online discrete choice experiment survey. All adults were 
asked to take the perspective of a 10-year-old child for both methods. Both 
samples were representative for Belgium in terms of age, sex and region. A 
latent class analysis was selected to obtain the relative importance of the five 
dimensions and their levels based on the discrete choice experiment data, which 
were anchored with the composite Time Trade-Off censored value for the worst 
health state (33333).
RESULTS: Preferences from Belgian adults revealed a mean censored value for 
33333 for children and adolescents of - 0.475. All the estimated coefficients of 
the model with 4 latent classes were statistically significant and showed higher 
disutility as severity levels increase. The most important health dimension was 
pain/discomfort, followed by feeling sad/worried/unhappy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the Belgian EQ-5D-Y-3L value set, which will be 
included in the Belgian pharmacoeconomic guidelines. The value set enables the 
calculation of quality-adjusted life-years in children and adolescents, allowing 
a cost-effectiveness evaluation of health technologies and their youth-specific 
price setting.

Despite being a popular speciality at the undergraduate level, paediatrics lags 
behind most other medical and surgical specialities for postgraduate 
recruitment. As many individuals decide on their future career choice while 
still in medical school, it is essential to identify the factors that attract 
individuals to a career in paediatrics. To determine the positive influencing 
factors determining paediatrics as a career choice. A scoping review of primary 
research articles was conducted using a comprehensive electronic search strategy 
and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews recommendations. Studies exploring 
medical students, junior doctors, and current paediatricians' perceptions of 
paediatrics were included. Factors affecting career choice were identified. 
Thirty-six studies out of a possible 3106 met the inclusion criteria and were 
included in this review. Six key influencing themes were identified. These were 
early undergraduate and clinical exposure to paediatrics; an attractive 
work-life balance; the presence of role models and mentors; an enjoyable working 
atmosphere and varied clinical work; a personal commitment to paediatrics; and 
working with children.
CONCLUSION:  Medical students are drawn by the wide clinical variety in 
paediatrics, enjoyable working atmosphere, and enthusiastic colleagues. Given 
the importance of early clinical exposure in determining student motivation, 
paediatrics needs to do more to advertise the wide variety of clinical and 
research work available, starting early in medical school. In addition, medical 
students need to be offered more opportunities to experience the speciality 
through student selected components, summer schools, or workshops, requiring 
coordination between medical schools and regional paediatric departments.
WHAT IS KNOWN: • Research suggests that many medical students make choices on 
their future career based on medical school experiences. • Paediatrics is a 
popular subject among medical students, however applications for the specialilty 
are in decline.
WHAT IS NEW: • Six key factors influencing paediatrics as a career choice have 
been identified, the most common being early exposure to paediatrics at medical 
school and lifestyle factors. • Interventions aimed at increasing student 
involvement in paediatrics at the undergraduate level have been shown to be 
associated with an increase in the number of individuals applying for the 
speciality following graduation.
