profile, although associated with frequent hyperglycemia, which requires 
monitoring of glucose metabolism. Moreover, the most recent once-monthly 
intramuscular formulation, pasireotide long-acting release (LAR), showed similar 
efficacy and safety, but associated with potential better compliance profile in 
CD. Roscovitine is an experimental drug currently under investigation. Among 
adrenal-directed agents, metyrapone is the only historical agent currently under 
investigation in a prospective, multicenter, international clinical trial, that 
would likely clarify its efficacy and safety in a large population of patients 
with CS. Osilodrostat, a novel agent with a mechanism of action similar to 
metyrapone, seems to offer a rapid, sustained, and effective disease control of 
CD, according to recently completed clinical trials, whereas levoketoconazole, a 
different chemical formulation of the historical agent ketoconazole, is still 
under investigation in clinical trials, with preliminary evidences showing an 
effective and safe control of CS. ATR-101 is an experimental drug currently 
under investigation. Among glucocorticoid receptor-directed drugs, mifepristone 
has been demonstrated to improve clinical syndrome and comorbidities, especially 
hypertension and impairment of glucose metabolism, but the occurrence of 
hypokalemia and in women uterine disorders, due to the concomitant action on 
progestin receptor, requires caution, whereas the preliminary evidence on 
relacorilant, characterized by high selectivity for glucocorticoid receptor, 
suggested good efficacy in the control of hypertension and impairment of glucose 
metabolism, as well as a good safety profile, in CS. Finally, a limited 
experience has demonstrated that combination therapy might be an interesting 
approach in the management of CD. The current review provides a summary of the 
available evidences from current and recent clinical trials on CD, with a 
specific focus on preliminary data.

CONTEXT: As the life expectancy prolongs, malignancy has become an important 
issue in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Thyroid cancer is the most common 
endocrine malignancy with ongoing increase in incidence all over the world.
OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study that investigates the 
thyroid disorders and the prevalence of thyroid nodule and cancer in RTRs.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 204 RTRs were evaluated for the thyroid diseases with 
ultrasonography, serum thyroid stimulating hormone, free T4, free T3 levels, 
anti-thyroglobulin antibody and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody levels; FNAB 
was carried if required.
RESULTS: 191 patients (94.1%) had normal thyroid function. Subclinical 
hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 11 patients, subclinical hyperthyroidism in 1 
patient and low T3 syndrome in 4 patients. The FNAB was performed in 17 (27.9%) 
from 61 patients with thyroid nodule. The cytological examination of biopsy 
materials revealed that 2 (11.8%) nodules were suspicious for malignancy, 13 
(76.5%) were benign, and 2 (11.8%) with non diagnostic cytology. Thyroid cancer 
prevalence was 0.2% in Turkey but we detected that 0.98% of RTRs had thyroid 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening the RTRs for thyroid disorders is necessary, so that 
early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of thyroid disease and cancer may 
improve the quality of life.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People with mental illness have worse physical health and 
reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. Nevertheless, their 
medical care is often insufficient. The present study aimed to investigate the 
somatic status of people with mental illness with a focus on somatic diagnoses, 
metabolic risk factors, regular somatic care, and routine check-ups.
METHODS: This study used a 14-item questionnaire to survey the somatic care 
situation of psychiatric university hospital patients. Main survey topics were 
psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, metabolic risk factors, regular somatic care, 
and routine check-ups.
RESULTS: Four-hundred and thirty-five people with mental illness (48.3% male, 
mean age 45.4 years) were included. More than three quarters of the 
participating people with mental illness had access to a general practitioner. 
People with affective and anxiety disorders reported significantly more contact 
with medical specialists for somatic diseases, but schizophrenic patients did 
not receive enough care. Not all people with mental illness and on psychiatric 
medication received regular somatic care. Somatic diseases increased with number 
of diagnoses, and the duration of the psychiatric illness was positively 
correlated with treatment motivation.
CONCLUSION: The observed unmet medical needs in this study might reflect the 
lack of treatment motivation in people with mental illness, but could also 
represent their obstacles to access care as well as a suboptimal communication 
between the treating psychiatrist and the referring general practitioner. 
Increasing awareness of somatic diseases in psychiatric patients and easier 
access to somatic care have to be implemented in psychiatric clinical routine. 
The risk of stigmatization in somatic institutions and the lack of self-care 
management in people with mental illness are complicating factors.

The increasing incidence of calcaneal tendon ruptures has substantially impacted 
orthopedic care and costs related to its treatment and prevention. Primarily 
motivated by the increasing of life expectancy, the growing use of tenotoxic 
drugs and erratic access to physical activity, this injury accounts for 
considerable morbidity regardless of its outcome. In recent years, the evolution 
of surgical and rehabilitation techniques gave orthopedists better conditions to 
decide the most appropriate conduct in acute tendon rupture. Although still 
frequent due to their high neglect rate, Achilles chronic ruptures currently 
find simpler and more biological surgical options, being supported by a new 
specialty-focused paradigm.

Chronic platelet disorders (CPD), including chronic immune thrombocytopenic 
purpura (cITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and platelet function 
disorders are among the most common bleeding disorders and are associated with 
morbidity and mortality. The clinical phenotype and complexity of cITP is much 
like that of hemophilia. In cITP and hemophilia, bleeding is problematic for 
many, complicating employability, insurability and overall quality-of-life 
(QoL). While myriad drug therapies are available for cITP and hemophilia, each 
are variable in their effectiveness, very few (except for clotting factor 
concentrates for hemophilia) alter the natural history of the disorder and 
sometimes contribute to specific morbidities and mortality. Like in hemophilia, 
the management of cITP is not solely based on access to effective treatment but 
also includes accurate diagnosis and comprehensive care by a multidisciplinary 
team of specialists trained in the management of bleeding disorders. The model 
of comprehensive care in Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) has been recognized 
as highly effective, improving life expectancy for persons with hemophilia. 
cITP, and other CPDs, are complex disorders requiring specialized care. However, 
an integrated care model with a systematic and reliable population-based 
surveillance program does not exist. Extending the Comprehensive Care model with 
all its related benefits to the community of persons with cITP is sorely needed. 
This review will focus on cITP as a prototype chronic platelet disorder that 
could benefit greatly from the Comprehensive Care model.

The segmented trapdoor spiders (Liphistiidae) are the sole surviving family of 
the suborder Mesothelae, which forms the sister lineage to all other living 
spiders. Liphistiids have retained a number of plesiomorphic traits and their 
present-day distribution is limited to East and Southeast Asia. Studying this 
group has the potential to shed light on the deep evolutionary history of 
spiders, but the phylogeny and divergence times of the family have not been 
resolved with confidence. We performed phylogenomic and molecular dating 
analyses of 2765 ultraconserved element loci from 185 liphistiid taxa. Our 
analyses show that the crown group of Liphistiidae appeared in the 
mid-Cretaceous at 102 Ma (95% credibility interval 92-113 Ma), but it was not 
until the Neogene that much of the diversification within the family occurred in 
mainland Southeast and East Asia. This diversification was coincident with 
tectonic events such as the extension of the East Asian continental margin, as 
well as geological upheavals in Indochina induced by the collision between India 
and Asia. Our study highlights the important role of major tectonic events in 
shaping the evolutionary history, present-day diversity, and geographical 
distribution of mesothele and liphistiid spiders. [biogeography; concatenation;

Targeted therapy for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) has allowed for a 
near-normal patient life-expectancy; however, quality of life and aggravation of 
existing co-morbidities have posed new treatment challenges. In clinical 
practice, TKI dose reduction occurs frequently, often on multiple occasions, 
because of intolerance. We conducted a retrospective 'real-world practice' 
review of 246 patients receiving lower than standard dose (LD) TKI after the 
achievement of major molecular response (MR3), because of intolerable adverse 
events. In 274 of 298 cases of dose reduction (91·9%), MR3 was maintained at 
median follow-up of 27·3 months. One patient progressed to blast crisis while on 
LD TKI. Two patients developed two new ABL kinase domain mutations (T315I and 
V299L), of whom one had achieved deep molecular response on an alternative LD 
TKI at last follow-up. Seventy-six patients eventually discontinued LD TKI and 
the two-year treatment-free remission (TFR) rate in these patients was 74·1%. 
The majority of patients with CML in at least MR3 appear to be safely managed 
with LD TKI, although three of 246 patients had new events (progression and new 
mutation), indicating that this approach requires vigilance. TKI LD does not 
prevent the achievement of TFR in this patient population.

The oral prodrug fostemsavir (GSK3684394, formerly BMS-663068) is an 
antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1. Fostemsavir is metabolized to its active 
moiety, temsavir, a first-in-class HIV-1 attachment inhibitor that binds to the 
viral envelope glycoprotein 120. Long-term antiretroviral therapy, the resulting 
longer life expectancy, and/or certain coinfections can increase the risk of 
chronic liver and kidney disease in HIV-1-infected individuals. Two studies were 
conducted to collectively evaluate the impact of renal and hepatic impairment on 
temsavir pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety following a single dose of a 600-mg 
extended-release fostemsavir tablet. There was no clinically meaningful effect 
of renal or hepatic impairment on temsavir PK, although renal clearance 
decreased with increasing renal impairment from moderate to severe, and exposure 
(maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
time 0 to infinity) tended to increase with increasing severity of hepatic 
impairment. No clinically meaningful effect of hemodialysis on temsavir PK 
parameters was observed. Fostemsavir was generally safe and well tolerated by 
treated subjects. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild, with the exception of 1 
patient in the renal impairment study who discontinued due to 2 serious AEs 
unrelated to the study drug. No other treatment-emergent serious AEs occurred, 
and no other AEs leading to discontinuation were reported. Overall, these 
results suggest that fostemsavir can be used without dose modification in 
subjects with mild to severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage 
renal disease on hemodialysis, and in subjects with mild to severe hepatic 
impairment.

Many epidemiological models of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on preventing 
deaths. Questions have been raised as to the frailty of those succumbing to the 
COVID-19 infection. In this paper we employ standard life table methods to 
illustrate how the potential quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses associated 
with COVID-19 fatalities could be estimated, while adjusting for comorbidities 
in terms of impact on both mortality and quality of life. Contrary to some 
suggestions in the media, we find that even relatively elderly patients with 
high levels of comorbidity can still lose substantial life years and QALYs. The 
simplicity of the method facilitates straightforward international comparisons 
as the pandemic evolves. In particular, we compare five different countries and 
show that differences in the average QALY losses for each COVID-19 fatality is 
driven mainly by differing age distributions for those dying of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: Sickle cell anaemia (SCA), an inherited chronic hematological disease 
affecting hundreds of thousand people worldwide, causes significant morbidity 
and reduced life expectancy about two or three decades. This study aimed to 
conduct a meta-analysis of the efficacy of voxelotor, 900 mg in patients with 
SCA.
METHODS: The research protocol was registered at the International Register of 
Prospective Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), under the registration number: 
CRD42020147796. ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, Conference Abstracts, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, Scopus, Web of 
Science, and Wiley Online Library from 2015 through July 25, 2019, and 
bibliographies of review articles and eligible studies. Eleven eligible studies 
that evaluated the effectiveness of voxelotor, 900 mg in SCA. Based on 
pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 randomized, placebo-controlled 
studies were included in the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The primary outcome measured was hemoglobin elevation, assessed in a 
highly similar fashion in both trials. There was a significant difference 
between voxelotor and placebo in haemoglobin change from baseline (mean 
difference [MD]: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-1.06). Voxelotor also 
reduced markers of haemolysis, MD: -36.79, 95% CI: (-75.05) to 1.48 for 
unconjugated bilirubin that changes from baseline; MD: -19.09, 95% CI: (-44.06) 
to 5.88 for the percentage of reticulocytes that change from baseline and MD: 
-23.29, 95% CI: (-65.14) to 18.55 for LDH that change from baseline) but the 
difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: As a conclusion, voxelotor, 900 mg use significantly increased 
hemoglobin levels which of 1 g/dL elevation predicts a reduced risk of stroke 
(41%), albuminuria (53%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (57%), and mortality 
(64%) in recent studies. Voxelotor also reduced markers of hemolysis but failed 
to reach statistically significance in current evidence. Multicenter, 
randomized, placebo-controlled studies are on the way and will provide more 
evidence to see the potential of disease-modifying effects of voxelotor.

ATP6V0A2-related cutis laxa, also known as autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 
2A (ARCL2A), is a subtype of hereditary cutis laxa originally characterized by 
skin, skeletal, and neurological involvement, and a combined defect of 
N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation. The associated clinical spectrum 
subsequently expanded to a less severe phenotype dominated by cutaneous 
involvement. At the moment, ARCL2A was described in a few case reports and 
series only. An Italian adult woman ARCL2A with a phenotype restricted to skin 
and the two novel c.3G>C and c.1101dup ATP6V0A2 variants has been reported. A 
systematic literature review allowed us to identify 69 additional individuals 
from 64 families. Available data were scrutinized in order to describe the 
clinical and molecular variability of ARCL2A. About 78.3% of known variants were 
predicted null alleles, while 11 were missense and 2 affected noncanonical 
splice sites. Age at ascertainment appeared as the unique phenotypic 
discriminator with earlier age more commonly associated with facial dysmorphism 
(p .02), high/cleft palate (p .005), intellectual disability/global 
developmental delay (p .013), and seizures (p .024). No specific 
genotype-phenotype correlations were identified. This work confirmed the 
existence of an attenuated phenotype associated with ATP6V0A2 biallelic variants 
and offers an updated critique to the clinical and molecular variability of 
ARCL2A.

In the fight against Covid-19, developed countries and developing countries 
diverge in success. This drew attention to the discussion of how different 
health systems and different levels of health spending are effective in 
combating Covid-19. In this study, the role of the health system in the fight 
against Covid-19 is discussed. In this context, the number of hospital beds, the 
number of doctors, life expectancy at 60, universal health service and the share 
of health expenditures in GDP were used as health indicators. In the study, 
firstly 2020 data was estimated by using the Artificial Neural Networks 
simulation method and this year was used in the analysis. The model, with the 
data of 124 countries, was estimated using the cross-sectional OLS regression 
method. The estimation results show that the number of hospital beds, number of 
doctors and life expectancy at the age of 60 have statistically significant and 
positive effects on the ratio of Covid-19 recovered/cases. Universal health 
service and share of health expenditures in GDP are not significant 
statistically on the cases and recovered. Hospital bed capacity is the most 
effective variable on the recovered/case ratio.

BACKGROUND: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been used because of its 
perceived advantages in reducing surgical site infections, wound complications, 
and the need for further surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess the 
infection rates, wound complications, length of stay, and financial burden 
associated with NPWT use in primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: We performed a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews 
and Meta-Analyses) systematic review of the existing literature on using NPWT in 
primary and revision TKA. PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, and the Cochrane 
Library were utilized. The risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBINS-I (Risk 
Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions) tool, and the quality of 
evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation) criteria.
RESULTS: Twelve articles that evaluated 1,403 primary TKAs and 279 revision TKAs 
were reviewed. NPWT significantly reduced complication rates in revision TKA. 
However, there was no significant difference in infection rates between NPWT and 
regular dressings in primary or revision TKA. NPWT use in primary TKA 
significantly increased the risk of blistering, although no increase in 
reoperations was noted. The analysis showed a possible reduction in length of 
stay associated with NPWT use for both primary and revision TKA, with overall 
health-care cost savings.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a meta-analysis of the existing literature, we do not 
recommend the routine use of NPWT. However, in high-risk revision TKA and 
selected primary TKA cases, NPWT reduced wound complications and may have 
health-care cost savings.

Although progress has been made in reducing disparities in life expectancy, 
addressing the persistence of health inequities by race remains a high priority 
for public health professionals. The purpose of this research was to refine a 
minority stress model (MSM) by identifying previously unrecognized factors 
contributing to stress and chronic disease health disparities among low-income 
middle-aged African-American men. Using a Community-Based Participatory Research 
approach, we conducted semi-structured individual health interviews with 42 
low-income middle-aged African-American men in a mid-size New England city. The 
interviews focused on the participants' perceptions of the causes of health 
disparities. Four major themes emerged from the analysis: the positive aspects 
of work, both financial and symbolic; and the negative repercussions of not 
working, both financial and symbolic in terms of a sense of self-respect. On an 
instrumental level, working men can support their family, be physically active 
and find social support. Symbolically, work provides a positive sense of 
identity as a man; it offers both social- and self-respect; it provides 
discipline and a sense of gratitude. Conversely, the lack of work is a 
significant source of stress, stemming both from the inability to support one's 
family and from having nothing to do, which lead to depression, low self-esteem, 
suicidal ideation and anger. With no perceived viable routes to socially 
approved roles, many low-income men of color succumb to internalizing a negative 
identity. This research demonstrates a clear link between structural problems 
with the US economy and harms to sense of identity among low-income, middle-aged 
African-American men.

For the analysis of xenobiotic metabolism, metabolites are commonly qualified by 
high-resolution mass spectrometry such as orbitrap or time-of-flight mass 
spectrometers, and quantified by triple-quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometer based 
multiple reaction monitoring. While this workflow shows drawback in the 
difficulty for instrumental parameters transfer, and QQQ provides less 
specificity. In this work, we constructed a high-resolution MS/MS (HR-MS/MS) 
based strategy to improve the discovery and quantification of unknown xenobiotic 
metabolites by metabolic pathway extension (MPE) searching combined with 
parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Taking the flavonoid metabolism in diabetes 
wound S9 incubates as a test case. Firstly, MPE approach was used to screen all 
potential metabolites. In this step, an m/z value library of all theoretic 
flavonoid metabolites were constructed based on predefined flavonoid structures 
through 21 common xenobiotic metabolic reactions, and this library was matched 
with all features extracted from raw data (MS1 scan) of flavonoid-S9 
co-incubate, then the matched features were exported into target list for MS2 
fragmentation for structure validation. Secondly, the metabolites were 
relatively quantified by PRM mode based on their characteristic product ions. As 
a result, 131 metabolites of 9 different kinds of flavonoids in the skin and 
muscle were identified. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on the 
metabolism of flavonoids in the skin or muscle tissue. The results also 
validated the proposed HR-MS/MS-based strategy provided high specificity 
throughout both discovery and quantitation process of unknown xenobiotic 
metabolites without need of instrumental parameter transfer.

BACKGROUND: Given increasing life expectancy in the United States and worldwide, 
the proportion of elderly patients affected by aneurysmal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (aSAH) would be expected to increase.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an aging trend exists in the population of aSAH 
patients presenting to our institution over a 28-yr period.
METHODS: A prospectively maintained database of consecutive patients presenting 
to our institution with subarachnoid hemorrhage between January 1991 and 
December 2018 was utilized. The 28-yr period was categorized into 4 successive 
7-yr quarter intervals. The age of patients was compared among these intervals, 
and yearly trends were derived using linear regression.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1671 ruptured aneurysm patients with a mean age 
of 52.8 yr (standard deviation = 15.0 yr). Over the progressive 7-yr time 
intervals during the 28-yr period, there was an approximately 4-fold increase in 
the proportion of patients aged 80 yr or above (P < .001) and an increase in 
mean patient age from 51.2 to 54.6 yr (P = .002). Independent of this trend but 
along the same lines, there was a 29% decrease in the proportion of younger 
patients (<50 yr) from 49% to 35%. On linear regression, there was 1-yr increase 
in mean patient age per 5 calendar years (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Analyses of aSAH patients demonstrate an increase in patient age 
over time with a considerable rise in the proportion of octogenarian patients 
and a decrease in patients younger than 50 yr. This aging phenomenon presents a 
challenge to the continued improvement in outcomes of aSAH patients.

Lumpur, Malaysia.

AIMS: As the Malaysian population is aging rapidly, there is an urgent need for 
an effective management plan for healthy aging, to extend life expectancy and to 
improve quality of life (QoL). Urinary incontinence (UI), which is common in 
older persons, is often linked to reduced QoL. This study aimed to determine the 
effects of UI on QoL among older persons in Malaysia.
METHODS: This study was based on data obtained from 3716 Malaysians aged 
≥60 years as part of the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2018. QoL 
was measured using the Control, Autonomy, Self-realization and Pleasure 19-item 
(CASP-19) questionnaire. UI was measured using the Questionnaire Urinary 
Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID) score. Association between UI and QoL were 
examined using linear regression analysis, after controlling socio-demographic 
variables and comorbidities.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of UI was 5.2%. By subtypes, the prevalence of 
stress UI and urge UI were both 2.0%, while that of mixed UI was 1.3%. The UI 
group rated their lives more negatively in all four domains of QoL compared with 
non-UI group. Those who were incontinent had lower standardized scores on 
control and autonomy domains of CASP-19 as well as total score. Results from 
linear regression analysis indicated that UI had a significantly negative impact 
on control and autonomy domains of QoL after controlling for socio-demographic 
factors and comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: UI contributes to a significant reduction on QoL of older persons. 
Healthcare providers need to be sensitive in evaluating and discussing UI, 
particularly with their older patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 38-42.

BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab was recently demonstrated to have survival benefit in 
patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(r/mHNSCC). However, the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy 
in China remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to describe the cost-effectiveness of 
pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care (SOC) therapy in r/mHNSCC in China.
DESIGN: A Markov model consisting of three health states (stable, progressive 
and dead) was developed to compare the cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab 
with SOC in platinum-resistant r/mHNSCC. Model inputs for transition 
probabilities and toxicity were collected from the KEYNOTE-040 trial, while 
health utilities were estimated from a literature review. Cost data were 
acquired for the payer's perspective in China. Costs and outcomes were 
discounted at an annual rate of 3.0%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
test the uncertainties surrounding model parameters.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs), which were calculated as the cost per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: The total mean cost of pembrolizumab and SOC was US$45 861 and US$41 
950, respectively. As for effectiveness, pembrolizumab yielded 0.31 QALYs 
compared with 0.25 QALYs for SOC therapy. The ICER for pembrolizumab versus SOC 
was US$65 186/QALY, which was higher than the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) 
of US$28 130/QALY in China. The univariate sensitivity analysis indicated that 
utility values for progressive state, probability from stable to progressive in 
the SOC group, as well as cost of pembrolizumab were the three most influential 
variables on ICER. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
standard therapy was more likely to be cost-effective compared with 
pembrolizumab at a WTP value of US$28 130/QALY. Results were robust across both 
univariate analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is not likely to be a cost-effective strategy 
compared with SOC therapy in patients with platinum-resistant r/mHNSCC in China.

Wearable devices play an increasing role in the rehabilitation of patients with 
movement disorders. Although information about muscular activation is highly 
interesting, no approach exists that allows reliable collection of this 
information when the sensor is applied autonomously by the patient. This paper 
aims to demonstrate the proof-of-principle of an innovative sEMG sensor system, 
which can be used intuitively by patients while detecting their muscular 
activation with sufficient accuracy. The sEMG sensor system utilizes a 
multichannel approach based on 16 sEMG leads arranged circularly around the 
limb. Its design enables a stable contact between the skin surface and the 
system's dry electrodes, fulfills the SENIAM recommendations regarding the 
electrode size and inter-electrode distance and facilitates a high temporal 
resolution. The proof-of-principle was demonstrated by elbow flexion/extension 
movements of 10 subjects, proving that it has root mean square values and a 
signal-to-noise ratio comparable to commercial systems based on pre-gelled 
electrodes. Furthermore, it can be easily placed and removed by patients with 
reduced arm function and without detailed knowledge about the exact positioning 
of the sEMG electrodes. With its features, the demonstration of the sEMG sensor 
system's proof-of-principle positions it as a wearable device that has the 
potential to monitor muscular activation in home and community settings.

As a crucial element of China's political and cultural life, "banners," or 
biāoyǔ, have been around for decades, in support of national-level policies such 
as family planning and the governing mottos of Presidents. The banners that have 
emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic which was also the subject of a 
national-level driven policy, have been involved in a nation-wide public debate 
over the language styles of banners used to urge people to stay indoors. Based 
on the analysis of the early COVID-19 banners and the related online comments, 
this article analyzes the language style patterns of the banners and the mode of 
banner circulation. The study found that the manner in which the banners are 
circulated goes beyond a unidirectional path of on-site instant communication. 
This process is facilitated by social networks and mass media, which, during 
circulation, twice created a banner upgrade. The upgrades created 
decontextualization and function extension of the banners, whereas audience 
feedback triggered an adaptive adjustment of the language style of the banners. 
This article suggests that the study of the use and spread of banners, 
especially the early COVID-19 banners, sheds light on the study of mass 
communication and discourse style, and also how measures to contain pandemics 
such as COVID-19 can be communicated.

Plant Polyphenols as Antioxidant and Antibacterial Agents for Shelf-Life 
Extension of Meat and Meat Products: Classification, Structures, Sources, and 
Action Mechanisms.

Oxidative processes and meat spoilage bacteria are major contributors to 
decreasing the shelf-life of meat and meat products. Oxidative processes occur 
during processing, storage, and light exposure, lowering the nutritional and 
sensory value and acceptability of meat and generating toxic compounds for 
humans. Polyphenols inhibit oxidative processes in 3 ways: as reactive species 
scavengers, lipoxygenase inhibitors, and reducing agents for metmyoglobin. Thus, 
polyphenols are candidate antioxidants for meat and meat products. The 
cross-contamination of meat with spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms can 
occur in production lines and result in economic losses. The ability of 
polyphenols to interact with bacterial cell wall components and the bacterial 
cell membrane can prevent and control biofilm formation, as well as inhibit 
microbial enzymes, interfere in protein regulation, and deprive bacterial cell 
enzymes of substrates and metal ions. Thus, polyphenols are candidate 
antimicrobial agents for use with meat and meat products. Commercially available 
polyphenols can decrease primary and secondary lipid peroxidation levels, 
inhibit lipoxygenase activity, improve meat color stability, minimize the 
degradation of salt-soluble myofibrillar protein and sulfhydryl groups, and 
retard bacterial growth. Further studies are now needed to clarify the 
synergistic/antagonistic action of various polyphenols, and to identify the best 
polyphenol classes, concentrations, and conditions of use.
