AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the life expectancy of the Cypriot 
population between 1986 and 2012.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the data reported in the annual editions of the 
Statistical Service of Cyprus and constructed life tables of the Cypriot 
population between 1986 and 2012.
RESULTS: For both genders, and for males and females separately, in the year 
1986 life expectancy accounted 74.47, 72.2, and 76.76 years respectively, while 
in 2012 values increased to about 81.28, 79.02, and 83.50 years respectively. 
The longitudinal trend of life expectancy is to increase over the calendar 
years. The largest increase in life expectancy occurred at birth and was 
approximately seven years for both males and females. Until the age of 55, this 
gain was approximately six years of life. From age 60 to 65 years, the gain was 
about five years of life, and in the oldest age groups, the gain was four years 
of life. The values corresponding to male were lower compared to those 
corresponding to females, with the exception of the age 0 (at birth).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in life expectancy of the Cypriot population 
was noted in the period 1986-2012, which was more obvious at younger ages and in 
females. Hippokratia 2016, 20(2): 99-103.

Promoting healthy eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources 
is a complex undertaking that often requires strong partnerships between various 
agencies. In local communities, these agencies are typically located in 
different areas, serve diverse subgroups, and operate distinct programs, 
limiting their communication and interactions with each other. This study 
assessed the network of agencies in local communities that promote healthy 
eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources. Network surveys 
were administered in 2016 among 89 agencies located in 4 rural counties in 
Michigan that served limited-resource audiences. The agencies were categorized 
into 8 types: K-12 schools, early childhood centers, emergency food providers, 
health-related agencies, social resource centers, low-income/subsidized housing 
complexes, continuing education organizations, and others. Network analysis was 
conducted to examine 4 network structures-communication, funding, cooperation, 
and collaboration networks between agencies within each county. Agencies had a 
moderate level of cooperation, but were only loosely connected in the other 3 
networks, indicated by low network density. Agencies in a network were 
decentralized rather than centralized around a few influential agencies, 
indicated by low centralization. There was evidence regarding homophily in a 
network, indicated by some significant correlations within agencies of the same 
type. Agencies connected in any one network were considerably more likely to be 
connected in all the other networks as well. In conclusion, promoting healthy 
eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources warrants strong 
partnership between agencies in communities. Network analysis serves as a useful 
tool to evaluate community partnerships and facilitate coalition building.

Appropriate medical decision-making in patients with keratinocyte skin cancer 
(KSC) can be challenging, especially in those with a limited life expectancy 
(LEx). Treatment should be beneficial for the individual patient, the risk of 
both over- and under-treatment should be carefully considered, and deviation 
from guideline recommendations may be necessary. In this study retrospective 
analysis was performed to determine the influence of age and comorbidity, both 
factors strongly related to limited LEx, on KSC management in daily practice. 
After analysis of 401 patients it was found that management in patients with KSC 
is not influenced, or is only minimally influenced, by high age and comorbidity. 
Better integration of aspects related to a limited LEx in KSC management might 
optimize care and prevent overtreatment. Future research on the general 
prognostication, prediction of the patient burden caused by tumour and 
treatment, and time-to-benefit in KSC management is strongly recommended.

INTRODUCTION: High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease. The urgency of the problem was underlined by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of 
noncommunicable diseases, which recommends a 25% relative reduction in the 
prevalence of raised BP by 2020. A surveillance system represents a useful tool 
to monitor BP in the general population. Since 1980s, the National Institute of 
Health has conducted several surveys of the adult general population, measuring 
cardiovascular risk factors by standardized procedures and methods.
AIM: To describe mean BP levels and high BP prevalence from 1978 to 2012 by sex 
and quinquennia of age.
METHODS: Data were derived from the following three studies: (i) Risk Factors 
and Life Expectancy (RIFLE), conducted between 1978 and 2002 in 13 Italian 
regions (>70,000 persons); (ii) Osservatorio Epidemiologico Cardiovascolare 
(OEC), conducted between 1998-2002 in the general population from all Italian 
regions (>9000 persons); and (iii) Osservatorio Epidemiologico 
Cardiovascolare/Health Examination Survey (OEC/HES), conducted between 2008-2012 
in the general population from all Italian regions (>9000 persons).
RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean systolic and diastolic BP levels and 
prevalence of high BP from 1978 to 2012 was observed both in men and women. BP 
and high BP increased by age classes in all considered periods. BP awareness and 
control also improved.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that BP control could be achieved by 2020, as 
recommended by WHO.

PET/CT, the most common form of hybrid imaging, has transformed oncologic 
imaging and is increasingly being used for nononcologic applications as well. 
Performing PET/CT in children poses unique challenges. Not only are children 
more sensitive to the effects of radiation than adults but, following radiation 
exposure, children have a longer postexposure life expectancy in which to 
exhibit adverse radiation effects. Both the PET and CT components of the study 
contribute to the total patient radiation dose, which is one of the most 
important risks of the study in this population. Another risk in children, not 
typically encountered in adults, is potential neurotoxicity related to the 
frequent need for general anesthesia in this patient population. Optimizing 
pediatric PET/CT requires making improvements to both the PET and the CT 
components of the procedure while decreasing the potential for risk. This can be 
accomplished through judicious performance of imaging, the use of recommended 
pediatric 18fluorine-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG) administered 
activities, thoughtful selection of pediatric-specific CT imaging parameters, 
careful patient preparation, and use of appropriate patient immobilization. In 
this article, we will review a variety of strategies for radiation dose 
optimization in pediatric 18F-FDG-PET/CT focusing on these processes. Awareness 
of and careful selection of pediatric-specific CT imaging parameters designed 
for appropriate diagnostic, localization, or attenuation correction only CT, in 
conjunction with the use of recommended radiotracer administered activities, 
will help to ensure image quality while limiting patient radiation exposure. 
Patient preparation, an important determinant of image quality, is another focus 
of this review. Appropriate preparative measures are even more crucial in 
children in whom there is a higher incidence of brown fat, which can interfere 
with study interpretation. Finally, we will discuss measures to improve the 
patient experience, the resource use, the departmental workflow, and the 
diagnostic performance of the study through the use of appropriate technology, 
all in the context of minimizing procedure-related risks.

PURPOSE: Establish costs of an inpatient palliative care unit (PCU) and conduct 
a threshold analysis to estimate the maximum possible costs for the PCU to be 
considered cost effective.
METHODS: We used a hospital perspective to determine costs on the basis of 
claims from administrative data from Johns Hopkins PCU between March 2013 and 
March 2014. Using existing literature, we estimated the number of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that the PCU could generate. We conducted a 
threshold analysis to assess the maximum costs for the PCU to be considered cost 
effective, incorporating willingness to pay ($180,000 per QALY). Three types of 
costs were considered, which included variable costs alone, contribution margin 
(ie, revenue minus variable costs), and PCU cost savings compared with usual 
care (from a separate publication).
RESULTS: The data showed that there were 153 patient encounters (PEs), variable 
costs of $1,050,031 ($1,343 per PE per day), a contribution margin of $318,413 
($407 per PE per day), and savings compared with usual care of $353,645 ($452 
savings per PE per day). On the basis of the literature, the program could 
generate 3.11 QALYs from PEs (0.05 QALY) and caregivers (3.06 QALYs). The 
threshold analysis determined that the maximum variable cost required to be cost 
effective was $559,800 (an additional $716 per PE per day could be spent).
CONCLUSION: According to variable costs, the PCU was not cost effective; 
however, when considering savings of the PCU compared with usual care, the PCU 
was cost saving. The contribution margin showed that the PCU was cost saving. 
This study supports efforts to expand PCUs, which enhance care for patients and 
their caregivers and can generate hospital savings. Future research should 
prospectively explore the cost utility of PCUs.

Quantitative Analysis of Long-Term Mass Rearing of Neoseiulus californicus 
(Acari: Phytoseiidae) on Almond Pollen.

P.O. Box 14115-336, Tehran, Iran.

Long-term feeding effects of the almond pollen on the life table parameters of 
Neoseiulus californicus McGregor were assessed after 5, 10, and 20 generations 
after introduction in the rearing arena. Furthermore, to evaluate behavioral 
characteristics of the mass-reared predator (strain A) in face with the real 
prey, functional and numerical responses of the predator to different densities 
of the twospotted spider mite nymphs were determined, and the obtained data were 
compared with those reared on twospotted spider mite (strain T). Long-term 
rearing did not significantly affect total fecundity of N. californicus (ranged 
from 37.79 to 41.91 eggs). Nevertheless, preadult duration in the 5th generation 
was significantly longer than the 10th and 20th generations. The intrinsic rate 
of increase (r) in the 10th (0.2056 d-1) and 20th (0.2201 d-1) generations had 
not significant difference together. However, the r value slightly dropped in 
the 5th generation (0.1706 d-1) because of the irregular offering of fresh 
pollen to the rearing colonies before that. Both strains of N. californicus 
exhibited a type II functional response; however, the N. californicus reared on 
the almond pollen (strain A) had a higher attack rate (a) and shorter handling 
time (Th). The individuals reared on the almond pollen had a greater size than 
those reared on twospotted spider mite; its higher predation potential is 
probably due to this characteristic. Consequently, the rearing of N. 
californicus on the almond pollen positively affected its attributes including 
high survivorship, body size, and fecundity, and subsequently higher potential 
to control twospotted spider mite.

When should active surveillance for prostate cancer stop if no progression is 
detected?

Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of screen-detected men with prostate cancer 
may be overdiagnosed. Active Surveillance (AS) has emerged as a way to mitigate 
this problem, by delaying treatment of men, who are at low-risk until this 
becomes necessary. However, it is not known after how much time or biopsy rounds 
should patients stop AS and transition to conservative management (CM), if no 
progression is detected.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model with natural history of prostate cancer 
based on ERSPC and SEER data. We modeled referral to treatment while in AS, 
based on Johns Hopkins treatment-free survival data. We projected lifetime costs 
and effects of AS (and radical treatment, if progression is detected) under 
different biopsy follow-up schedules compared to CM, where radical treatment 
only occurs when men would be clinically diagnosed in absence of screening.
RESULTS: For men with low-risk disease in younger age groups (55-65), AS is 
cost-effective for up to 7 yearly biopsy rounds. For men older than 65, even one 
biopsy round results in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, though it may 
result in QALYs gained for men without previous screening. For men with 
intermediate-risk disease AS is cost-effective even for men in 65-75 age group.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of AS when compared to CM is strongly dependent on life 
expectancy and disease risk. Clinicians should take this into account when 
selecting men to AS, deciding on biopsy frequency and when to stop AS 
surveillance rounds and transition to CM.

Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare rates of hospital 
utilisation in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples before and after hospital 
admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and/or type 2 
diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: This was a longitudinal cohort study from 2002 to 2014, which was 
conducted in all hospitals in Western Australia. The participants of this study 
were Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with a principal diagnosis of heart 
failure, type 2 diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on admission 
to hospital, where such an event had not occurred in the previous 3 years. 
Inpatient days and ED presentations were the main outcome measures.
RESULTS: Among the patients with chronic disease, Aboriginal people have similar 
inpatient days for all causes compared to non-Aboriginal people. However, they 
have much higher ED presentations in comparison. Age of onset of cardinal events 
occurs 15-20 years earlier in Aboriginal patients with chronic disease. Although 
age has little influence on ED presentations in non-Aboriginal chronic disease 
patients, younger Aboriginal people with chronic disease present far more often 
to ED than older Aboriginal people.
CONCLUSIONS: Aboriginal people use health services in a different manner when 
compared to non-Aboriginal people. In a subset of patients with chronic disease, 
high use may be reduced with better access to primary healthcare. Policy-makers 
and healthcare providers should examine healthcare use from primary to tertiary 
care among the Aboriginal population, with a particular focus on ED 
presentations; investigate the underlying causes driving specific patterns of 
health service utilisation among Aboriginal people; and develop interventions to 
reduce potential deleterious impacts, and enhance the potential benefits, of 
specific patterns of healthcare use.

Comment in
    World Neurosurg. 2018 Feb;110:509.

For many years, the right hemisphere (RH) was considered as nondominant, 
especially in right-handers. In neurosurgical practice, this dogma resulted in 
the selection of awake procedure with language mapping only for lesions of the 
left dominant hemisphere. Conversely, surgery under general anesthesia (possibly 
with motor mapping) was usually proposed for right lesions. However, when 
objective neuropsychological assessments were performed, they frequently showed 
cognitive and behavioral deficits after brain surgery, even in the RH. 
Therefore, to preserve an optimal quality of life, especially in patients with a 
long survival expectancy (as in low-grade gliomas), awake surgery with cortical 
and axonal electrostimulation mapping has recently been proposed for resection 
of right tumors. Here, we review new insights gained from intraoperative 
stimulation into the pivotal role of the RH in movement execution and control, 
visual processes and spatial cognition, language and nonverbal semantic 
processing, executive functions (e.g., attention), and social cognition 
(mentalizing and emotion recognition). These original findings, which break with 
the myth of a nondominant RH, may have important implications in cognitive 
neurosciences, by improving our knowledge of the functional connectivity of the 
RH, as well as for the clinical management of patients with a right lesion. In 
brain surgery, awake mapping should be considered more systematically in the RH. 
Moreover, neuropsychological examination must be achieved in a more systematic 
manner before and after surgery within the RH, to optimize care by predicting 
the likelihood of functional recovery and by elaborating specific programs of 
rehabilitation.

AIM: The role of maternal vaginal bacteria on the colonization of neonatal gut 
is still a matter of discussion. Our aim was to estimate the role of maternal 
vaginal flora on the development of intestinal flora in neonates and 3-month-old 
infants.
METHODS: Seventy-nine maternal-neonatal pairs were included in the study. 
Vaginal swabs were taken before the rupture of membranes after admission to the 
delivery ward. First neonatal stool (meconium) and stool at 3-month-old infants 
were collected and cultured. All samples were subjected to microbiological 
analysis for Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium 
(including C. difficile), Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, and Candida.
RESULTS: Maternal vagina was colonized mainly by streptococci (67%) followed by 
lactobacilli (58%) and Candida spp. (39%). Vaginal streptococci influenced the 
intestinal colonization in infants with staphylococci, C. difficile, and 
candida.
CONCLUSION: Vaginal lactobacilli influenced colonization with C. difficile, and 
Candida. Vaginal flora is a potent factor influencing the development of 
bacterial flora in the neonatal and infantile gut. The extension of the 
observation period until 3 months of life allow to discover the potential 
changes in the intestinal flora of children.

BACKGROUND: The combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically 
improved the life expectancy of patients with HIV infection, but may lead to 
several long-term metabolic abnormalities. However, data about the frequency of 
metabolic syndrome (MS) in HIV-infected people vary considerably across 
different observational studies.
METHODS: The prevalence of MS among HIV-infected patients was evaluated by a 
cross-sectional study conducted among subjects naive to cART or receiving the 
first antiretroviral regimen and referring to our Clinics from January 2015 to 
December 2015. The diagnosis of MS was made based on the National Cholesterol 
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III), and International 
Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria.
RESULTS: The study recruited 586 patients: 98 naive to cART and 488 under the 
first antiretroviral treatment. The prevalence of MS, according to NCEP-ATP III 
criteria, was significantly higher among treated patients than among naive ones 
(20.9% vs. 7.1%; p = 0.014). The most frequently reported components of MS among 
treated patients were high triglycerides (44.3%), low high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (41.1%), and hypertension (19.7%). On multivariate analysis, long 
duration of HIV infection, low nadir of CD4 lymphocytes, high body mass index, 
current use of one protease inhibitor, and long duration of cART were 
significantly associated with a higher risk of MS, while current use of one 
integrase inhibitor was significantly associated with a lower risk of MS.
CONCLUSIONS: The non-negligible prevalence of MS among HIV-infected patients 
under cART requires a careful and periodic monitoring of its components, with 
particular attention to dyslipidemia and hypertension.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the potential impact of an additional 20% tax on 
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) on productivity in Australia.
METHODS: We used a multi-state lifetable Markov model to examine the potential 
impact of an additional 20% tax on SSBs on total lifetime productivity in the 
paid and unpaid sectors of the economy. The study population consisted of 
Australians aged 20 years or older in 2010, whose health and other relevant 
outcomes were modelled over their remaining lifetime.
RESULTS: The SSBs tax was estimated to reduce the number of people with obesity 
by 1.96% of the entire population (437,000 fewer persons with obesity), and 
reduce the number of employees with obesity by 317,000 persons. These effects 
translated into productivity gains in the paid sector of AU$751 million for the 
working-age population (95% confidence interval: AU$565 million to AU$954 
million), using the human capital approach. In the unpaid sector, the potential 
productivity gains amounted to AU$1172 million (AU$929 million to AU$1435 
million) using the replacement cost method. These productivity benefits are in 
addition to the health benefits of 35,000 life years gained and a reduction in 
healthcare costs of AU$425 million.
CONCLUSIONS: An additional 20% tax on SSBs not only improves health outcomes and 
reduces healthcare costs, but provides productivity gains in both the paid and 
unpaid sectors of the economy.

Innovative Therapy.

Neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases (NPDs) are today's most important 
group of diseases, surpassing both atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 
cancer in morbidity incidence. Although NPDs have a dramatic impact on our 
society because of their high incidence, mortality, and severe debilitating 
character, remarkably few effective interventions have become available. The 
current treatments, if available, comprise the lifelong intake of general 
immunosuppressants to delay disease progression or neurotransmitter 
antagonists/agonists to dampen undesired behaviors. The long-term usage of such 
medication, however, coincides with often severe adverse side effects. There is, 
therefore, an urgent need for safe and effective treatments for these diseases. 
Here, we discuss that many NPDs coincide with subtle chronic or flaring brain 
inflammation sometimes escalating with infiltrations of lymphocytes in the 
inflamed brain parts causing mild to severe or even lethal brain damage. Thus, 
NPDs show all features of autoimmune diseases. In this review, we postulate that 
NPDs resemble autoimmune-driven inflammatory diseases in many aspects and may 
belong to the same disease spectrum. Just like in autoimmune diseases, NPD 
symptoms basically are manifestations of a chronic self-sustaining inflammatory 
process with detrimental consequences for the patient. Specific inhibition of 
the destructive immune responses in the brain, leaving the patient's immune 
system intact, would be the ultimate solution to cure patients from the disease. 
To reach this goal, the primary targets, e.g., the primary self-antigens (pSAgs) 
of the patient's chronic (auto)immune response, need to be identified. For a few 
major NPDs, immunological studies led to the identification of the pSAgs 
involved in the autoimmune damage of specific brain parts. However, further 
research is needed to complete the list of pSAgs for all NPDs. Such 
immunological studies will not only provide crucial insights into NPD 
pathogenesis but also ultimately enable the development of a new generation of 
safe and effective immunotherapies for NPDs. Interventions that will 
dramatically improve the life expectancy and quality of life of individual 
patients and, moreover, will significantly reduce the health-care costs of the 
society in general.

Reslizumab (Cinqaero®; Cinqair®) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against 
interleukin-5 (IL-5), a cytokine mediator of eosinophilic airway inflammation. 
Reslizumab is indicated as an add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in 
adults, on the basis of data from the BREATH phase III clinical trial programme. 
In three double-blind BREATH studies of up to 52 weeks' duration, adding 
intravenous reslizumab (3 mg/kg, once every 4 weeks) to the current asthma 
therapy of patients (aged 12-75 years) with eosinophilic asthma inadequately 
controlled with inhaled corticosteroids resulted in significant reductions in 
clinical asthma exacerbation frequency and significant improvements in lung 
function, asthma control and health-related quality of life relative to adding 
placebo. Pooled data from the two trials of 52 weeks' duration indicated similar 
benefits with reslizumab across various patient subgroups, including patients 
with severe eosinophilic asthma. Reslizumab was generally well tolerated, with 
very few recipients experiencing severe or serious treatment-related adverse 
events. Moreover, in an open-label extension study, continued use of reslizumab 
for up to 2 years was associated with durable lung function benefit, without any 
new tolerability concerns. Thus, intravenous reslizumab extends the valuable 
add-on treatment options for adults with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately 
controlled with standard therapies.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to summarize and appraise published 
cost-effectiveness studies on stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic 
body radiation therapy (SBRT).
RECENT FINDINGS: We performed a Medline search of cost-effectiveness studies of 
SRS, SBRT, and other cancer treatment modalities such as surgery and systemic 
therapy from 2006 to 2016. We included studies that used both modeling and 
retrospective review techniques. We excluded studies of benign disease. We 
defined a strategy whose incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is 
≤$50,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as "clearly cost-effective," a 
strategy whose ICER is ≤$100,000/QALY as "probably cost-effective," and a 
strategy ≤$200,000/QALY as "possibly cost-effective." We appraised modeling 
studies by determining whether or not they conform to the International Society 
for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Good Research Practices (ISPOR) in 
modeling task force good research practices in model transparency and 
validation. We identified 24 studies that met inclusion criteria. Treatment 
sites included brain, bone, liver, lung, pancreas, and prostate. SRS and SBRT 
were clearly cost-effective strategies in 17 studies, probably cost-effective in 
3 studies, and possibly cost-effective in 2 studies. Of the 16 modeling 
studies,15 conformed to transparency best practices; however, only 6 studies 
performed rigorous validation as described by the ISPOR guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: SRS and SBRT are likely to be cost-effective management strategies 
across a large variety of treatment sites and techniques. However, rigorous 
model validation techniques are lacking in these modeling studies.

The Report on the Status of Nutrition and Chronic Diseases of Chinese residents 
(2015) indicated that the prevalence of diabetes was 9.7% among adults aged ⩾18 
years, which markedly increased from 2.6% in 2002 within 10 years. In addition 
to the social economic factors, transitions in food consumption, behavioral and 
lifestyle playing the important roles in the fast increase of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). In 2010-2012, the cereal food consumption of Chinese residents 
was 337 g/d, vegetables consumption 269 g/d, fruit consumption 41 g/d, legume 
and legume products 11 g/d, dairy and dairy products consumption 25 g/d, meat 
consumption 90 g/d, edible oil consumption 42 g/d and dietary fiber 10.8 g/d. 
The traditional Chinese dietary pattern (high consumption of rice, pork and 
vegetables) is shifting towards a dietary pattern with high consumption of meats 
and edible oil but low consumption of cereals and vegetables. Smoking, breakfast 
omitting and high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages became popular. 
Insufficient physical activity rate was 31.7%. Less sleep duration and poorer 
sleep quality was also common for Chinese residents. Concerning early life 
factors, residents exposed to the Chinese famine (1959-1961) during fetal life 
and childhood had an increased risk of hyperglycemia. As a conclusion, current 
unhealthy lifestyle has inversely effect on the incidence and development of 
T2DM, especially for the increased intake of fat and carbohydrate, the 
transition of dietary pattern, the extension of sedentary time and the 
increasing rate of obesity. Lifestyle management should be taken seriously as a 
part of diabetes prevention.

The problem of life expectancy of indigenous and non-indigenous population of 
northern territories of the Russian Federation is considered in terms of 
economic growth and industrial development of the northern territories. The 
importance of prolonging the period of active working age of non-indigenous 
population of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug-Ugra and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous 
Okrug is increasing. Four directions for possible prolongation of the active 
life of non-indigenous population were presented. The problem of comparative 
dynamics of age-related changes of cardiovascular system on three specific age 
groups of female indigenous and non-indigenous population is being considered. A 
decrease in volume of quasi-attractors in the phase space of states is 
equivalent to strengthening of physical activity, which is typical of normal 
aging. It is proposed to use the mathematical pattern to reduce these volumes in 
assessing the dynamics of human aging in the North.

The study focuses on the issue of older people employment in the European Union 
and Ukraine. We analyzed the relationship of employment for older people and 
their income, of employment and of the value of index of social capital, life 
expectancy and income after retirement. It is shown that the employment rate of 
older people increased even during the economic crisis. The author has outlined 
the main causes of employment and the fields of activity of retirees. The basic 
reasons of employment are financial motives. However, motivation does not come 
from financial necessity, but because of work satisfaction in countries such as 
Denmark, Austria, Sweden. The main scope of employment of retirees in Ukraine is 
the industrial sector, but in the EU working retirees 65+ are engaged in 
agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, self-employment widespread among 
retirees. The author has outlined the basic directions of pension policy.

странах Европейского союза и на Украине. Проанализированы связи занятости 
пожилых людей и их дохода, занятости и значения индекса социального капитала, 
ожидаемой продолжительности жизни и дохода людей пожилого возраста. Показано, 
что уровень занятости пенсионеров увеличился даже в период экономического 
кризиса. Выделены основные причины и сферы занятости пенсионеров. Среди причин 
занятости на первом месте — финансовые мотивы. Однако в таких странах, как 
Дания, Австрия, Швеция, мотивация исходит не из финансовой необходимости, а из 
удовлетворения от работы. Если на Украине основная сфера занятости пенсионеров — 
промышленный сектор, то пенсионеры после 65 лет в странах ЕС чаще заняты в 
сельском хозяйстве, занимаются рыболовством и рыбоводством, среди пенсионеров в 
ЕС широко распространена самозанятость. Выделены основные направления пенсионной 
политики.

The goal of aging research is to extend healthy, active life. For decades, 
C. elegans daf-2 insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor mutants 
have served as a model for extended lifespan and youthfulness. However, a recent 
report suggested that their longevity is associated with an 
undesirable phenotype: a disproportionately long period of decrepitude at the 
end of life. In the human population, such an outcome would be a burden to 
society, bringing into question the relevance of daf-2 mutants as a model for 
life extension. However, here we report that, following an extended period of 
movement, daf-2 mutants survive longer in a decrepit state because of a 
beneficial trait: they are resistant to colonization of the digestive tract by 
dietary bacteria, a condition that leads to premature death in the wild-type and 
prevents their manifestation of decrepitude. If bacterial colonization is 
prevented, then daf-2 mutants lead both chronologically and proportionately 
healthier lives relative to the wild-type.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is highly prevalent in hospitalized patients and 
results in a worsened clinical course as well as an increased length of stay, 
mortality, and costs. Therefore, simple nutrition screening systems, such as 
CIPA (control of food intake, protein, anthropometry), may be implemented to 
facilitate the patient's recovery process. The aim of this study is to evaluate 
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementing such screening tool in 
a tertiary hospital, consistent with the lack of similar, published studies on 
any hospital nutrition screening system.
METHODS: The present study is carried out as an open, controlled, randomized 
study on patients that were admitted to the Internal Medicine and the General 
and Digestive Surgery ward; the patients were randomized to either a control or 
an intervention group (n = 824, thereof 412 patients in each of the two study 
arms). The control group underwent usual inpatient clinical care, while the 
intervention group was evaluated with the CIPA screening tool for early 
detection of malnutrition and treated accordingly. CIPA nutrition screening was 
performed upon hospital admission and classified positive when at least one of 
the following parameters was met: 72 h food intake control < 50%, serum 
albumin < 3 g/dL, body mass index < 18.5 kg/m2 (or mid-upper arm 
circumference ≤ 22.5 cm). In this case, the doctor decided on whether or not 
providing nutrition support. The following variables will be evaluated: hospital 
length of stay (primary endpoint), mortality, 3-month readmission, and 
in-hospital complications. Likewise, the quality of life questionnaires 
EQ-5D-5 L are being collected for all patients at hospital admission, discharge, 
and 3 months post-discharge. Analysis of cost-effectiveness will be performed by 
measuring effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The 
cost per patient will be established by identifying health care resource 
utilization; cost-effectiveness will be determined through the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We will calculate the incremental cost per QALY 
gained with respect to the intervention.
DISCUSSION: This ongoing trial aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
implementing the malnutrition screening tool CIPA in a tertiary hospital.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases and the number of older people, 
particularly those aged 85 years and over, expands there is an increase in 
demand for long-term care. A large proportion of people in a care home setting 
spend most of their time sedentary, and this is one of the leading preventable 
causes of death. Encouraging residents to engage in more physical activity could 
deliver benefits in terms of physical and psychological health, and quality of 
life. This study is the final stage of a programme of research to develop and 
preliminarily test an evidence-based intervention designed to enhance 
opportunities for movement amongst care home residents, thereby increasing 
levels of physical activity.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a cluster randomised feasibility trial, aiming to 
recruit at least 8-12 residents at each of 12 residential care homes across 
Yorkshire, UK. Care homes will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to receive 
either the intervention alongside usual care, or to continue to provide usual 
care alone. Assessment will be undertaken with participating residents at 
baseline (prior to care home randomisation) and at 3, 6, and 9 months 
post-randomisation. Data relating to changes in physical activity, physical 
function, level of cognitive impairment, mood, perceived health and wellbeing, 
and quality of life will be collected. Data at the level of the home will also 
be collected and will include staff experience of care, and changes in the 
numbers and types of adverse events residents experience (for example, hospital 
admissions, falls). Details of National Health Service (NHS) usage will be
