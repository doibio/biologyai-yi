interventions in Africa and South East Asia in the context of the millennium 
development goals.
DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model.
SETTING: Analyses undertaken for two regions classified by WHO according to 
their epidemiological grouping-Afr-E, countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very 
high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, countries in South East Asia 
with high adult and high child mortality.
DATA SOURCES: Published studies, costing databases, expert opinion.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 
2000 international dollars (dollarsInt).
RESULTS: Treatment of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in DOTS 
programmes cost dollarsInt6-8 per DALY averted in Afr-E and dollarsInt7 per DALY 
averted in Sear-D at coverage levels of 50-95%. In Afr-E, adding treatment of 
smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases at a coverage level of 95% cost 
dollarsInt95 per DALY averted; the addition of DOTS-Plus treatment for multidrug 
resistant cases cost dollarsInt123. In Sear-D, these costs were dollarsInt52 and 
dollarsInt226, respectively. The full combination of interventions could reduce 
prevalence and mortality by over 50% in Sear-D between 1990 and 2010, and by 
almost 50% between 2000 and 2010 in Afr-E.
CONCLUSIONS: DOTS treatment of new smear-positive cases is the first priority in 
tuberculosis control, including in countries with high HIV prevalence. DOTS 
treatment of smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases and DOTS-Plus treatment of 
multidrug resistant cases are also highly cost effective. To achieve the 
millennium development goal for tuberculosis control, substantial extra 
investment is needed to increase case finding and implement interventions on a 
wider scale.

Organization, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the costs and benefits of interventions for maternal and 
newborn health to assess the appropriateness of current strategies and guide 
future plans to attain the millennium development goals.
DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Two regions classified by the World Health Organization according to 
their epidemiological grouping: Afr-E, those countries in sub-Saharan Africa 
with very high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, comprising countries 
in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality.
DATA SOURCES: Effectiveness data from several sources, including trials, 
observational studies, and expert opinion. For resource inputs, quantities came 
from WHO guidelines, literature, and expert opinion, and prices from the WHO 
choosing interventions that are cost effective database.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 
year 2000 international dollars.
RESULTS: The most cost effective mix of interventions was similar in Afr-E and 
Sear-D. These were the community based newborn care package, followed by 
antenatal care (tetanus toxoid, screening for pre-eclampsia, screening and 
treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and syphilis); skilled attendance at 
birth, offering first level maternal and neonatal care around childbirth; and 
emergency obstetric and neonatal care around and after birth. Screening and 
treatment of maternal syphilis, community based management of neonatal 
pneumonia, and steroids given during the antenatal period were relatively less 
cost effective in Sear-D. Scaling up all of the included interventions to 95% 
coverage would halve neonatal and maternal deaths.
CONCLUSION: Preventive interventions at the community level for newborn babies 
and at the primary care level for mothers and newborn babies are extremely cost 
effective, but the millennium development goals for maternal and child health 
will not be achieved without universal access to clinical services as well.

Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Glucocorticosteroids (mostly dexamethasone) are widely used to 
prevent chronic lung disease in premature infants. Neonatal rats treated with 
dexamethasone have been shown to have reduced cardiac mass and cardiomyocyte 
hypertrophy, suggesting a lower number of cardiomyocytes at adult age, and a 
severely reduced life expectancy. In the present study we tested the hypothesis 
that a lower number of cardiomyocytes in later life is caused by a reduced 
cardiomyocyte proliferation and/or by early cell death (apoptosis).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Rat pups received dexamethasone or saline control on day 1, 
2 and 3 and were sacrificed at day 0, 2, 4, 7 and 21. The cardiomyocytes of 
dexamethasone treated pups showed a reduced proliferation as indicated by a 
lower mitotic index and reduced number of Ki-67 positive cardiomyocytes on day 2 
and 4 as compared to day 0 and day 7 and also as compared to the age-matched 
saline pups. On day 7 and day 21 the mitotic index was not different between 
groups. From day 2 onward up to day 21 dexamethasone treated pups showed a lower 
number of cardiomyocytes. The cardiomyocytes showed no signs (<<1%) of apoptosis 
(Caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP) in any group.
CONCLUSION: The temporary suppression of cardiomyocyte hyperplasia found in 
dexamethasone treated pups eventually leads to a reduced number and hypertrophy 
of cardiomyocytes during adult life.

AIMS: Whilst the CArdiac REsynchronization in Heart Failure (CARE-HF) trial has 
shown that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to reduced morbidity 
and mortality, the cost-effectiveness of this therapy remains uncertain. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained and incremental cost per life year gained of CRT plus medical 
therapy compared to medical therapy alone.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective analysis based on intention to treat data 
from all patients enrolled in the CARE-HF trial at 82 clinical centres in 12 
European countries. A total of 813 patients with New York Heart Association 
class III or IV heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and 
cardiac dyssynchrony were randomized to CRT plus medical therapy (n = 409) vs. 
medical therapy alone (n = 404). During a mean follow-up of 29.4 months CRT was 
associated with increased costs (4316, 95% CI: 1327-7485), survival (0.10 years, 
95% CI: -0.01-0.21), and QALYs (0.22, 95% CI: 0.13-0.32). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was 19 319 per QALY gained (95% CI: 5482-45 402) and 43 
596 per life-year gained (95% CI: -146 236-223 849). These results were 
sensitive to the costs of the device, procedure, and hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with CRT appears cost-effective at the notional 
willingness to pay threshold of 29 400 (20,000 pounds sterlings) per QALY 
gained.

P.O. Box 19024, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. sramsey@fhcrc.org

BACKGROUND: Although the rationale for earlier screening of persons with a 
family history of colorectal cancer is plausible, there is no direct evidence 
that earlier assessment is either effective or cost-effective.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical and economic effect of using family history 
assessment to identify persons for colorectal cancer screening before age 50.
METHODS: We developed a decision model to compare costs and outcomes for two 
scenarios: (a) standard population screening starting at age 50; (b) family 
history assessment at age 40, followed by screening colonoscopy at age 40 for 
those with a suggestive family history of colorectal cancer. The analysis was 
conducted using the health insurer perspective.
RESULTS: Using U.S. population estimates, 22 million would be eligible for 
family history assessment, and one million would be eligible for early 
colonoscopy; 2,834 invasive cancers would be detected, and 29,331 life years 
would be gained. The initial program cost would be USD $900 million. The 
discounted cost per life year gained of family history assessment versus no 
assessment equals USD $58,228. The results were most sensitive to the life 
expectancy benefit from earlier screening, the cost of colonoscopy, and the 
relative risk of colon cancer in those with a family history.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of family history assessment for colorectal 
cancer approaches that of other widely accepted technologies; yet, the results 
are sensitive to several assumptions where better data are needed. Because of 
the relatively high prevalence of family history in the population, careful 
analysis and empirical data are needed.

Transdermal fentanyl in the management of children with chronic severe pain: 
results from an international study.

Finkel JC(1), Finley A, Greco C, Weisman SJ, Zeltzer L.

Author information:
(1)Department of Anesthesiology, George Washington University, Washington, DC, 
USA. jfinkel@cnmc.org

BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to assess the safety and 
tolerability of a transdermal fentanyl delivery system for the relief of chronic 
pain in a pediatric population, and also to validate titration recommendations 
and conversion to transdermal fentanyl from oral opioid therapy.
METHODS: This 15-day (with 3-month extension), single-arm, open-label trial was 
conducted at 66 sites in 10 countries. A total of 199 pediatric patients (ages 
2-16 years) with both malignant and nonmalignant conditions who were receiving 
oral or parenteral opioids for moderate to severe chronic pain were enrolled. 
Transdermal fentanyl doses were titrated upward according to the rescue 
medication consumed during the previous application period. Degree of pain was 
assessed by patients and parents/guardians using visual and numeric scales. 
Level of play and quality of life were assessed using the Play Performance Scale 
(PPS) and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). Adverse events were monitored on 
Days 1-15. Hypoventilation and sedation were monitored every 4 hours during the 
first 72 hours of the study.
RESULTS: A total of 173 patients completed the primary treatment period and 130 
entered the extension phase. The average daily pain intensity scores were 
reported to have decreased by Day 16 and improvements in the mean PPS scores 
were observed to the end of the extension period. The CHQ scores demonstrated 
improvements in 11 of 12 domains after Month 1 of the extension period.
CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal fentanyl was found to be a safe and well tolerated 
alternative to oral opioid treatment for children ages 2-16 years who were 
previously exposed to opioid therapy.

Since the clinical profile and prognosis of heart failure depending on time of 
the study performed, regional characteristics of background population and 
different race, we attempted to evaluate the prognosis of symptoms and life 
expectancy of Japanese patients with heart failure. We evaluated the clinical 
profiles and prognoses of 1,015 consecutive patients with congestive heart 
failure (CHF) for whom hospitalization was required. A total of 1,015 
consecutive CHF patients (584 males and 431 females) were enrolled in this 
study, however the total number of events investigated was 1,409. Of these 
patients, survival was confirmed in 413 patients, death was confirmed in 299 
patients, and the prognoses of 303 patients remained unknown due to transfer to 
other hospitals or for some other reasons. The mean age on admission was 68.4 
+/- 14.9 years. In both males and females, the peak age at the onset of CHF was 
in the seventies, and for patients in their eighties, the number of female 
patients with CHF was larger than that of male patients. Major underlying heart 
diseases consisted of ischemic heart disease (34%), valvular heart disease 
(22%), dilated cardiomyopathy (11%), and hypertension (10%). Most CHF patients 
who had dilated cardiomyopathy as an underlying disease were hospitalized 
several times, and 45% of them were hospitalized 3 times or more. The life 
expectancy of patients with CHF caused by ischemic heart disease was the 
poorest, and their 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 55% and 38%, 
respectively. Similarly, 5-year and 10-year survival rates of patients with CHF 
caused by valvular heart disease, hypertension, and dilated cardiomyopathy were 
62% and 44%, 58% and 53%, and 70% and 65%, respectively. In 299 deceased 
patients, the mean age at death was 72.2 +/- 13.9 years. In all these deceased 
patients, direct causes of death were sudden death (16.1%), CHF (42.2%), others 
(31.4%), and unknown (10.4%). The frequency of sudden death was highest (25%) in 
patients with CHF caused by dilated cardiomyopathy, followed by those with CHF 
caused by valvular heart disease (18%) and those with CHF caused by ischemic 
heart disease (17.5%). In addition, the frequency of death from CHF was highest 
(60%) in those with CHF caused by dilated cardiomyopathy, followed by those with 
CHF caused by ischemic heart disease (49.2%).

Sir2 is a conserved deacetylase that modulates life span in yeast, worms, and 
flies and stress response in mammals. In yeast, Sir2 is required for maintaining 
replicative life span, and increasing Sir2 dosage can delay replicative aging. 
We address the role of Sir2 in regulating chronological life span in yeast. Lack 
of Sir2 along with calorie restriction and/or mutations in the yeast AKT 
homolog, Sch9, or Ras pathways causes a dramatic chronological life-span 
extension. Inactivation of Sir2 causes uptake and catabolism of ethanol and 
upregulation of many stress-resistance and sporulation genes. These changes 
while sufficient to extend chronological life span in wild-type yeast require 
severe calorie restriction or additional mutations to extend life span of 
sir2Delta mutants. Our results demonstrate that effects of SIR2 on chronological 
life span are opposite to replicatve life span and suggest that the relevant 
activities of Sir2-like deacetylases may also be complex in higher eukaryotes.

patients with primary hepatic carcinoma after resection.

University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. sjm418@hzcnc.com

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of a patient with primary hepatic carcinoma 
(PHC) is hard to predict, and it is related to many prognostic factors. The 
Chinese classification system including five parameters: tumor, vascular 
thrombosis, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and Child-Pugh stage 
developed in 1999 was adopted by the 8th National Conference on Liver Cancer of 
the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association in 2001. In this study, the discriminatory 
ability of the Chinese classification system was compared with that of the TNM 
staging in patients for resection of PHC, in addition to the evaluation of 
prognostic value.
METHODS: The data of 246 patients who had undergone resection of PHC from 
January 1986 to December 2000 (average age, 51 years; male/female ratio, 213/33) 
were retrospectively studied. Among the 246 patients, 227 were followed up for 
at least 3 years.
RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year tumor-free survival rates were 55%, 
30%, 25%, 20% and 18%, respectively. The Chinese classification system was 
better than the TNM staging system in predicting survival rate of patients with 
PHC, as confirmed by survival curves shown by the Kaplain-Meier method. The mean 
survival time was 155, 70, 39, 16, and 4 months in patients with the Chinese 
classification stages Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, and III, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 5-, 
7-, and 10-year tumor-free survival rates of the Chinese classification system 
and TNM staging were statistically significant and had a slightly positive 
relationship. The predictive capacity of the Chinese classification system was 
confirmed in any two subgroups of patients undergoing operation. COX 
proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the Chinese classification 
system was the only independent prognostic factor for survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taking both tumor extension and liver function into account, we 
consider that the Chinese classification system making up for the deficiency of 
UICC TNM staging is more precise in predicting the prognosis of patients with 
resection of PHC.

Cost-effectiveness of a low-carbohydrate diet and a standard diet in severe 
obesity.

Eating Disorders Program, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, 
USA. gildena@mail.med.upenn.edu

OBJECTIVE: Low-carbohydrate diets have become a popular alternative to standard 
diets for weight loss. Our aim was to compare the cost-effectiveness of these 
two diets.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The patient population included 129 severely 
obese subjects (BMI = 42.9) from a randomized trial; participants had a high 
prevalence of diabetes or metabolic syndrome. We compared within-trial costs, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (CER) for the two study groups. We imputed missing values for QALYs. The 
CER was bootstrapped to derive 95% confidence intervals and to define 
acceptability cut-offs. We took a societal perspective for our analysis.
RESULTS: Total costs during the one year of the trial were 6742 dollars +/- 6675 
and 6249 dollars +/- 5100 for the low-carbohydrate and standard groups, 
respectively (p = 0.78). Participants experienced 0.64 +/- 0.02 and 0.61 +/- 
0.02 QALYs during the one year of the study, respectively (p = 0.17 for 
difference). The point estimate of the incremental CER was -1225 dollars/QALY 
(i.e., the low-carbohydrate diet dominated the standard diet). However, in the 
bootstrap analysis, the wide spread of CERs caused the 95% confidence interval 
to be undefined. The probabilities that the low-carbohydrate diet was 
acceptable, using cut-offs of 50,000 dollars/QALY, 100,000 dollars/QALY, and 
150,000 dollars/QALY, were 72.4% 78.6%, and 79.8%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: The low-carbohydrate diet was not more cost-effective for weight 
loss than the standard diet in the patient population studied. Larger studies 
are needed to better assess the cost-effectiveness of dietary therapies for 
weight loss.

Fifty years of chimpanzee demography at Taronga Park Zoo.

j.littleton@auckland.ac.nz

There has been a captive Pan troglodytes colony at Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney, 
Australia, since the mid-1930s. Demographic data on these animals were first 
analyzed in 1986; however, further information collected for 15 years since then 
is now available. The reproductive histories of 33 females in the colony have 
been recorded, and these data form the largest collection of captive chimpanzee 
data from a setting that has involved natural breeding conditions since the 
mid-1960s. These data were analyzed in conjunction with data from wild 
populations to establish the degree of variability present within chimpanzee 
reproductive parameters, and to identify which distinctive life history 
characteristics persist in well-provisioned, natural-fertility populations. The 
age at first birth for the chimpanzee females is 9.8 yr on average (n=16), which 
is 1-4.8 yr earlier than the average for wild populations. In line with this 
accelerated reproduction, birth intervals are also significantly shorter than 
those in noncaptive chimpanzee populations. The median birth interval for all 
surviving infants (based on a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) is 49 months 
(n=43) compared to 62+ months for wild groups. At the same time, infant 
mortality remains high. The data confirm distinctive features of the life 
history of common chimpanzees, including later maturation, long birth intervals, 
a relatively invariant fertility schedule, and high juvenile mortality. However, 
aspects of both fertility and mortality are significantly related to social 
circumstances, indicating that in common chimpanzees, as in humans, life history 
characters may represent ecological and social adaptations rather than 
species-fixed characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease. However, little is known about the effects of physical activity on life 
expectancy with and without cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to 
calculate the consequences of different physical activity levels after age 50 
years on total life expectancy and life expectancy with and without 
cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: We constructed multistate life tables using data from the Framingham 
Heart Study to calculate the effects of 3 levels of physical activity (low, 
moderate, and high) among populations older than 50 years. For the life table 
calculations, we used hazard ratios for 3 transitions (healthy to death, healthy 
to disease, and disease to death) by levels of physical activity and adjusted 
for age, sex, smoking, any comorbidity (cancer, left ventricular hypertrophy, 
arthritis, diabetes, ankle edema, or pulmonary disease), and examination at 
start of follow-up period.
RESULTS: Moderate and high physical activity levels led to 1.3 and 3.7 years 
more in total life expectancy and 1.1 and 3.2 more years lived without 
cardiovascular disease, respectively, for men aged 50 years or older compared 
with those who maintained a low physical activity level. For women the 
differences were 1.5 and 3.5 years in total life expectancy and 1.3 and 3.3 more 
years lived free of cardiovascular disease, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Avoiding a sedentary lifestyle during adulthood not only prevents 
cardiovascular disease independently of other risk factors but also 
substantially expands the total life expectancy and the cardiovascular 
disease-free life expectancy for men and women. This effect is already seen at 
moderate levels of physical activity, and the gains in cardiovascular 
disease-free life expectancy are twice as large at higher activity levels.

The purpose of this study was to examine the factors associated with life 
expectancy at the age of 65 years used as the index of longevity, using 
published data in Japan. Life expectancy at the age of 65 years was obtained 
from the 19th life table in 2000 published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare of Japan. The associations between life expectancy at the age of 65 
years and environmental factors were assessed by Spearman correlation 
coefficients. Life expectancy at the age of 65 years was higher in females 
(22.54 years) than in males (17.42 years). In this study, the number of public 
health nurses and leisure time per day were found significantly associated with 
life expectancy at the age of 65 years in both men and women. For men, life 
expectancy at the age of 65 years was significantly associated with leisure time 
for sports and exercises and higher proportion of participation in volunteer 
activities in the community; for women, it was associated with a higher number 
of hospitals and proportion of participation in educational classes for the 
aged. Our ecological study might provide some clues to more practical planning 
for longevity in consideration of gender differences.

In the broadest sense, cellular stress describes conditions wherein cells 
encounter and react to a 'non-normal' state. Perturbations may originate through 
both extracellular and intracellular means. Whereas transient levels of stress 
are expected to occur on a regular basis, a series of checks and balances 
ensures that cells are well equipped to maintain a homeostatic state. In the 
case of supra-physiological stress signaling, cellular challenges are more 
severe, and programmed cell death may be the best option for the organism. The 
ability of a cell, and by extension, an organism, to adequately manage cellular 
stress is fundamental--a question of life or death. The endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) is exquisitely poised to sense and respond to cellular stresses including 
those that result from metabolic and/or protein folding imbalances. In response 
to stress originating from within the ER, the PERK and Ire1 protein kinases, 
along with other proximal signaling molecules, initiate a program of 
transcriptional and translational regulation termed the unfolded protein 
response. A consequence of ER stress is the accumulation of reactive oxygen 
species that promotes a state of oxidative stress. PERK signaling, via 
activation of the Nrf2 and ATF4 transcription factors, coordinates the 
convergence of ER stress with oxidative stress signaling. Here we discuss 
progress regarding the signaling pathways involved in these cellular stresses 
and the implications of the intersection between the two signaling pathways.

As the life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis increases, unusual 
complications including amyloidosis are increasingly recognised. We report three 
cases of amyloidosis including a unique case presenting with a hemorrhagic and 
thrombotic diatheisis. This complication of amyloidosis has never been reported 
in cystic fibrosis.

Economic evaluation of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with 
inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists in a health maintenance 
organization.

OBJECTIVES: In light of recent results from observational studies showing 
prolonged survival in subjects taking long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) and/or 
inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
we investigated their cost-effectiveness (CE).
METHODS: Costs and survival data were collected for a sample of members enrolled 
in a large Health Maintenance Organization in the United States. An 
observational study design was used to evaluate cumulative costs and health 
benefits of LABA, ICS, ICS+LABA, or comparison drugs. Survival was estimated 
using a parametric regression model. Costs were adjusted for censoring and 
prognostic factors. CE was evaluated over a time horizon of 36 months and the 
remaining lifetime of subjects.
RESULTS: Over 36 months, life expectancy and costs were: 2.4 years (95% 
confidence interval (CI): 2.3; 2.5) and $28,030 (CI: $23,400; $33,570) for not 
receiving ICS or LABA; 2.6 years (CI: 2.6; 2.7) and $35,170 (CI: $29,970; 
$40,620) for ICS alone; 2.6 years (CI: 2.5; 2.7) and $27,380 (CI: $21,780; 
$32,510) for LABA alone; and, 2.7 years (CI: 2.6; 2.8) and $33,780 (CI: $28,700; 
$39,440) for subjects treated with ICS+LABA. The lifetime analysis showed 
similar trends.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an acute need to find effective, life-extending treatments 
for persons with COPD. ICS, LABA or their combination represent promising 
treatment options and are currently being tested in randomized trials. If the 
impact on survival seen in these trials compares to that seen in observational 
studies, LABA and the combination treatment are likely to be cost-effective in 
the United States.

Potential costs and benefits of newborn screening for severe combined 
immunodeficiency.

(1)Department of Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los 
Angeles, CA, 90095-1752, USA. smcghee@mednet.ucla.edu

OBJECTIVE: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a rare, treatable disorder 
of the immune system. The incidence is unknown but may be more common than 
published estimates because infants frequently die of infection before 
diagnosis. SCID is a candidate for universal newborn screening, so there is a 
need to determine under which circumstances screening would be cost-effective.
STUDY DESIGN: We assumed a screening program for SCID would use T-cell 
lymphopenia as the screening criterion and performed a cost-utility analysis 
comparing universal screening with screening only those with a family history of 
SCID.
RESULTS: Assuming society is willing to pay $50,000 for every quality-adjusted 
life-year saved, a SCID screening test that cost less than $5 with a 
false-negative rate of 0.9% and a false-positive rate of 0.4% would be 
considered cost-effective. A nationwide screening program would cost an 
additional $23.9 million per year for screening costs but would result in 760 
years of life saved per year of screening. The cost to detect 1 case of SCID 
would be $485,000.
CONCLUSION: SCID screening could result in a large benefit to detected 
individuals, making screening relatively cost-effective in spite of the low 
incidence of the disease. However, an adequate test is critical to 
cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: It is postulated that patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers 
from affluent classes have better survival outcomes than those from deprived 
backgrounds. We aimed to analyze the incidence, mortality, and survival trends 
of esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers in West Midlands, England, from 
1986 to 2000 in terms of socioeconomic deprivation.
METHODS: A well-validated demographic score, the Townsend Band, was employed as 
a measure of socioeconomic status. Data were collated from a cancer registry 
database; the individuals were allocated to 1 of 5 Townsend bands by using the 
postcodes at diagnosis. Relative survival rates were calculated by using 
stratified actuarial life tables, regression trend analysis at 1 and 5 years was 
performed, and the P value was derived from a t test statistic.
RESULTS: An increase in esophageal cancer incidence was more marked in the 
affluent categories (127%), compared with the deprived categories (57%). Gastric 
cancer incidence fell preferentially by 31% and 47% in the most-deprived men and 
women, respectively, but remained relatively unchanged in the affluent groups. A 
marginal overall decrease in pancreatic cancer incidence masked preferential 
increases in the most-affluent men (39%) and women (41%). Small increases in 1- 
and 5-year survival were noted in affluent subgroups, with the 1-year survival 
advantage for esophageal cancer achieving significant levels in the 
most-affluent categories (P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The esophageal cancer incidence increased preferentially in the 
affluent groups but with a marginally better survival rate. The gastric cancer 
incidence decreased noticeably in the most-deprived groups, suggesting that 
improvements in hygiene with consequent reduction in Helicobacter pylori 
primarily could be responsible. Pancreatic cancer trends were unrelated to 
social deprivation and warrant further studies.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of fluvastatin in patients with diabetes after 
successful percutaneous coronary intervention.

Herston, Brisbane, Australia. p.scuffham@uq.edu.au

BACKGROUND: The Lescol Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS) was a multinational 
randomized controlled trial that showed a 47% reduction in the relative risk of 
cardiac death and a 22% reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) from 
the routine use of fluvastatin, compared with controls, in patients undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, defined as angioplasty with or without 
stents). In this study, MACEs included cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, and subsequent PCI and coronary artery bypass graft. Diabetes was 
the greatest risk factor for MACEs.
OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of fluvastatin when used 
for secondary prevention of MACEs after PCI in people with diabetes.
METHODS: A post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes from the LIPS 
was used to estimate the effectiveness of fluvastatin in reducing myocardial 
infarction, revascularization, and cardiac death. A probabilistic Markov model 
was developed using United Kingdom resource and cost data to estimate the 
additional costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained over 10 years 
from the perspective of the British National Health Service. The model contained 
6 health states, and the transition probabilities were derived from the LIPS 
data. Crossover from fluvastatin to other lipid-lowering drugs, withdrawal from 
fluvastatin, and the use of lipid-lowering drugs in the control group were 
included.
RESULTS: In the subgroup of 202 patients with diabetes in the LIPS trial, 18 
(15.0%) of 120 fluastatin patients and 21 (25.6%) of 82 control participants 
were insulin dependent (P = NS). Compared with the control group, patients 
treated with fluvastatin can expect to gain an additional mean (SD) of 0.196 
(0.139) QALY per patient over 10 years (P < 0.001) and will cost the health 
service an additional mean (SD) of 10 pounds ( 448 pounds) (P = NS) (mean [SD] 
US $16 [$689]). The additional cost per QALY gained was 51 pounds (US $78). The 
key determinants of cost-effectiveness included the probabilities of repeat 
interventions, cardiac death, the cost of fluvastatin, and the time horizon used 
for the evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Fluvastatin was an economically efficient treatment to prevent MACEs 
in these patients with diabetes undergoing PCI.

Chronic critical ischemia of the limbs (CCIL) typically raises the problem of 
early diagnosis and specialized treatment. The challenge is considerable since 
the incidence of CCIL is in the range of 500 to 1,000 patients/million 
inhabitants/year, with an incidence of major amputations from 100 to 300/million 
inhabitants/year. Mortality of these patients reaches 20% at 6 months and more 
than 80% at 10 years, which places the CCIL in the group of highly malignant 
oncological diseases. Despite therapeutic advances, the rate of amputations 
continues to progress especially in diabetics whose life expectancy is 
increasing due the excellent contribution of coronaropathy. Prequisites are 
summarized in the TASC consensus and in the discussions conducted during the 
creation of vascular centres: multidisciplinary teams, arteriopathy register 
(including CCIL and center audits), development of protocols (evaluation cost - 
efficiency of revascularization and medical treatments, evaluation of 
angiogenesis projects), collaboration between vascular centers and networks. 
CCIL is a malignant disease with an increasing incidence implying early and 
specialized care; means exist but efforts have to be made regarding their 
evaluation and coordination.

The increased life expectancy in industrialised countries in the last half 
century has also brought to a greater incidence of neurological disorders, 
including neurodegenerative diseases and developing in a rather long time. In 
this respect, Alzheimer's disease (AD), for the large incidence, and the 
dramatic loss of autonomy caused by its cognitive and behavioural symptoms 
represents one of the main challenges of modern medicine. Although AD is a 
typical human disease and probably includes several nosographic entities, the 
use of animal models may contribute to understand specific aspects of 
pathophysiology of the disease. The most widely used animal models are rodents 
and non-human primates. In this review different animal models characterised by 
impaired cognitive functions are analysed. None of the models available mimics 
exactly cognitive, behavioural, biochemical and histopathological abnormalities 
observed in neurological disorders characterised by cognitive impairment. 
However, partial reproduction of neuropathology and/or cognitive deficits of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia and dementia occurring in 
Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, or in other neurodegenerative disorders 
may represent a basis for understanding pathophysiological traits of these 
diseases and for contributing to their treatments.

OBJECTIVE: To study the growth rate and factors influencing progression of small 
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).
DESIGN: Observational, longitudinal, prospective study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We followed patients with AAA <5 cm in diameter in two 
groups. Group I (AAA 3-3.9 cm, n = 246) underwent annual ultrasound scans. Group 
II (AAA 4-4.9 cm, n = 106) underwent 6-monthly CT scans.
RESULTS: We included 352 patients (333 men and 19 women) followed for a mean of 
55.2+/-37.4 months (6.3-199.8). The mean growth rate was significantly greater 
in group II (4.72+/-5.93 vs. 2.07+/-3.23 mm/year; p<0.0001). Group II had a 
greater percentage of patients with rapid aneurysm expansion (>4 mm/year) (36.8 
vs. 13.8%; p<0.0001). The classical cardiovascular risk factors did not 
influence the AAA growth rate in group I. Chronic limb ischemia was associated 
with slower expansion (< or = 4 mm/year) (OR 0.47; CI 95% 0.22-0.99; p = 0.045). 
Diabetic patients in group II had a significantly smaller mean AAA growth rate 
than non-diabetics (1.69+/-3.51 vs. 5.22+/-6.11 mm/year; p = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: The expansion rate of small AAA increases with the AAA size. AAA 
with a diameter of 3-3.9 cm expand slowly, and they are very unlikely to require 
surgical repair in 5 years. Many 4-4.9 cm AAA can be expected to reach a 
surgical size in the first 2 years of follow-up. Chronic limb ischemia and 
diabetes are associated with reduced aneurysm growth rates.

Why therapeutic response may not prolong the life of a cancer patient: selection 
for oncogenic resistance.

Most cancers do not respond to chemotherapy. Disappointedly, even objective 
clinical responses to anticancer therapy often do not translate into 
improvements in overall survival. To explain the response-survival paradox, it 
has been pointed out that effective therapy is ineffective against cancer stem 
cells, which replenish the tumor (causing relapse). In contrast, I discuss that, 
according to this scenario, patient survival will be prolonged at least by the 
duration of remission. Furthermore, stem-cell-based relapses will be sensitive 
to the initial therapy, and in theory cancer could be controlled indefinitely. 
To explain the paradox, I discuss that effective therapy selects for resistance 
among proliferating cancer cells. Importantly, mechanisms of resistance can be 
divided into nononcogenic (e.g., drug transporters and mutation in drug-targets) 
and oncogenic (e.g., apoptosis avoidance and cell cycle dysregulation). 
Oncogenic resistance is associated with highly aggressive cancer phenotype and, 
therefore, there is no increase in overall survival. I further suggest that (a) 
therapeutic response is a prerequisite for successful therapy, (b) resistance 
can be exploited for therapeutic advantage, (c) each response can be translated 
into increased survival, and (e) in slow growing tumors, cancer can be stopped 
without tumor shrinkage. Therapy will control cancer if it can selectively 
suppress proliferating cancer cells and will improve survival as long as 
acquired resistance can be exploited.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze healthy life expectancy (HLE) for major racial and gender 
subgroups, based on the diverse population of Tennessee and compared with the 
United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use life table methodology and the HLE calculation 
model of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), using two databases 
for 2001: NCHS National Vital Statistics Reports life tables and CDC Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey.
RESULTS: For Tennessee, although average total life expectancy (TLE) is 73.6 
years at birth, only 61.1 years of "good" health are expected. Substantial 
racial and gender differences are found in both TLEs and HLEs with black males 
having the lowest and white females the highest. Although females have longer 
TLE, they spend more years in an unhealthy state than males.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings raise new challenges for researchers and health policy 
makers for accomplishing the dual goals of longer life expectancy and 
elimination of health disparities among population subgroups.

Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Chronology poorly predicts biological age (BA) or physiologic reserve 
(PR). An objective approach to the heterogeneity of aging would greatly help 
clinical decision making in the elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first pilot study evaluated 130 "healthy" volunteers, 
ages 70 to 95 years. A summary BA/PR index was developed, using measures of 
endurance, strength, flexibility, balance, cognition, depression, comorbidity, 
and exercise. The second study applied the BA/PR concept to prediction of death 
after a first elective coronary artery bypass graft, using a Veterans 
Administration database.
RESULTS: The BA/PR index was a better predictor of 3-year functional outcomes 
and death than was chronological age. In the coronary artery bypass graft study, 
the inclusion of BA/PR variables significantly improved prediction of 6-month 
and long-term death for Veterans Administration patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of a biological age (BA/PR) approach in predicting 
outcomes in the elderly was supported. Needed research should develop tools for 
routine "tracking" of the aging process.
