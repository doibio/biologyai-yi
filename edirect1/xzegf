Accessory breast tissue (supernumerary breast tissue) is due to the absence of 
regression of the primitive milk lines during embryonic life which extends from 
the axilla to the groin. It is mostly located in the axilla where it is often 
confused with the axillary extension of the breast, or any pathological process 
occurring in armpits. Ectopic mammary glands should not be misdiagnosed as it 
can potentially undergo the same pathological processes that occur in a normally 
located breast including benign or malignant breast tumors. We report the case 
of an intracystic papilloma arising from left axillary accessory breast tissue 
in a 63-year-old woman. The principal symptom was pain in a palpable left 
axillary mass without inflammatory signs. Subsequent imaging and histopathologic 
examination proved it to be a papillary tumor in ectopic breast tissue.

IMPORTANCE: The reported phenotypes of men with 47,XXY and 47,XYY syndromes 
include tall stature, multisystem comorbidities, and poor health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL). However, knowledge about these sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) 
conditions has been derived from studies in the <15% of patients who are 
clinically diagnosed and also lack diversity in age and genetic ancestry.
OBJECTIVES: Determine the prevalence of clinically diagnosed and undiagnosed X 
or Y chromosome aneuploidy among men enrolled in the Million Veteran Program 
(MVP); describe military service metrics of men with SCAs; compare morbidity and 
mortality outcomes between men with SCA with and without a clinical diagnosis to 
matched controls.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-control.
SETTING: United States Veterans Administration Healthcare System.
PARTICIPANTS: Biologic males enrolled in the MVP biobank with genomic 
identification of an additional X or Y chromosome (cases); controls matched 1:5 
on sex, age, and genetic ancestry.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of men with SCAs from genomic analysis; 
clinical SCA diagnosis; Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); rates of outpatient, 
inpatient, and emergency encounters per year; self-reported health outcomes; 
standardized mortality ratio (SMR).
RESULTS: An additional X or Y chromosome was present in 145 and 125 per 100,000 
males in the MVP, respectively, with the highest prevalence among men with 
European and East Asian ancestry. At a mean age of 61±12 years, 74% of male 
veterans with 47,XXY and >99% with 47,XYY remained undiagnosed. Individuals with 
47,XXY (n=862) and 47,XYY (n=747) had similar military service history, 
all-cause SMR, and age of death compared to matched controls. CCI and healthcare 
utilization were higher among individuals with SCA, while several measures of 
HRQoL were lower. Men with a clinical diagnosis of 47,XXY had higher healthcare 
utilization but lower comorbidity score compared to those undiagnosed.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: One in 370 males in the MVP cohort have SCA, a 
prevalence comparable to estimates in the general population. While these men 
have successfully served in the military, they have higher morbidity and report 
poorer HRQoL with aging. Longer longitudinal follow-up of this sample will be 
informative for clinical and patient-reported outcomes, the role of ancestry, 
and mortality statistics.
KEY POINTS: Comparable to the general population, approximately 1 in 370 male 
veterans have a sex chromosome aneuploidy, but most are undiagnosed.Men with X 
or Y chromosome aneuploidy successfully complete US miliary duty with similar 
service history compared to their 46,XY peers.Medical comorbidities and 
healthcare utilization metrics are higher in male veterans with 47,XXY and 
47,XYY during aging, however life expectancy is similar to matched controls.

Terminally ill cancer patients often experience demoralization and loss of 
dignity, which undermines their spiritual wellbeing, which could, however, be 
supported by the presence of other factors such as self-transcendence and 
religious coping strategies. To assess self-transcendence and religious coping 
strategies and how they influence spirituality, we studied 141 end-stage cancer 
patients (64.3% male; mean age 68.6 ± 14.6) with a Karnofsky Performance Status 
≤ 50 and a life expectancy ≤ 4 months using the Self-Transcendence Scale, the 
Demoralization Scale, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy-Spiritual Wellbeing (FACIT-Sp-12), the Brief Religious COPE, and the 
Patient Dignity Inventory. To understand the effects of these variables on 
spirituality, hierarchical multiple regression was performed on FACIT-Sp-12. The 
final model predicted 67% of the variance in spiritual wellbeing. Demoralization 
was the strongest influencing factor (β = -0.727, p < 0.001), followed by 
self-transcendence (β = 0.256, p < 0.001), and positive religious coping (β = 
0.148, p < 0.05). This study suggests that self-transcendence and positive 
religious coping may be protective factors for spirituality in terminal cancer 
patients. These factors should be considered in treatment to promote spiritual 
wellbeing and improve patients' quality of life at the end of life.

The world faced COVID-19, which was a threat to public health and disturbed the 
educational system and economic stability. Educational institutes were closed 
for a longer period, and students faced difficulty to complete their syllabus. 
The government adopted a policy of "suspending classes without stopping 
learning" to continue education activities. However, student satisfaction with 
online education is a growing concern. Satisfaction of students is an important 
indicator of academic quality. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the 
influencing factors behind learning satisfaction using information from 335 
students from various institutes in Pakistan. This research examined the impact 
of computer and internet knowledge, instructor and course material, and Learning 
Management Systems (LMS) on learning satisfaction. The path coefficients were 
obtained via Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The 
LMS is a tool that facilitates the learning process with the provision of all 
types of educational material. The path coefficient was more in the case of LMS 
(0.489), which indicates its positive and significant role to attain learning 
satisfaction. The instructor and course material ordered second (0.261), which 
shows that the quality of an instructor and course material also plays a 
positive role to attain learning satisfaction. The computer and internet are 
essential ingredients of online education, showing a significant and positive 
path coefficient (0.123), implying that computer and internet knowledge could 
enhance learning satisfaction. The universities should develop their LMS to 
implement online education with quality course materials. It is also vital that 
the instructor should be up to date with modern learning techniques while 
ensuring internet connectivity, especially in rural areas. The government should 
provide an internet connection to students at discounted rates.

Endoscopic Stenting for Malignant Dysphagia in Patients with Esophageal Cancer.

Institute, 3-1-69, Otemae, Chuo-ku, Osaka 541-8567, Japan.

Malignant dysphagia is a common problem in patients with esophageal cancer. 
Endoscopic stenting can resolve dysphagia caused by malignant stricture; 
however, controversy exists regarding the use of esophageal stenting for the 
treatment of malignant stricture, including whether stenting or radiotherapy is 
superior, whether stenting before or after radiotherapy is safe, whether 
stenting before or after chemotherapy is safe, and whether low-radial-force 
stents are safer than conventional stents. Among treatment options for malignant 
dysphagia, stenting may have some disadvantages in terms of pain relief and the 
risk of adverse events compared with radiotherapy and in terms of survival 
compared with gastrostomy. Additionally, the risk of stent-related adverse 
events is significantly associated with prior radiotherapy. The risk of 
perforation is especially high when a radiation dose of >40 Gy is delivered to 
the esophagus after stenting, whereas perforation is not associated with prior 
chemotherapy or additional chemotherapy after stenting. Nevertheless, stenting 
remains an important palliative option, especially for patients with a short 
life expectancy and a strong desire for oral intake, because stenting can 
facilitate a more rapid improvement in dysphagia than radiotherapy or 
gastrostomy. The application of a low-radial-force stent should be considered to 
reduce the risk of adverse events, especially in patients with prior 
radiotherapy.

Health Technology Reassessment: Addressing Uncertainty in Economic Evaluations 
of Oncology Drugs at Time of Reimbursement Using Long-Term Clinical Trial Data.

The evidence base to support reimbursement decision making for oncology drugs is 
often based on short-term follow-up trial data, and attempts to address this 
uncertainty are not typically undertaken once a reimbursement decision is made. 
To address this gap, we sought to conduct a reassessment of an oncology drug 
(pembrolizumab) for patients with advanced melanoma which was approved based on 
interim data with a median 7.9 months of follow-up and for which long-term data 
have since been published. We developed a three-health-state partitioned 
survival model based on the phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 clinical trial data using 
patient-level data reconstruction techniques based on an interim analysis. We 
used a standard survival analysis and parametric curve fitting techniques to 
extrapolate beyond the trial follow-up time, and the model structure and inputs 
were derived from the literature. Five-year long-term follow-up data from the 
trial were then used to re-evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab 
versus ipilimumab for treatment of advanced melanoma. The best fitting 
parametric curves and corresponding survival extrapolations for reconstructed 
interim data and long-term data reconstructed from KEYNOTE-006 were different. 
An analysis of the 5 year long-term follow-up data generated a base case 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) that was 28% higher than the ICER 
based on interim trial data. Our findings suggest that there may be a trade-off 
between certainty and the ICER. Conducting health technology re-assessments of 
certain oncology products on the basis of longer-term data availability, 
especially for those health technology adoption decisions made based on immature 
clinical data, may be of value to decision makers.

Despite marked advancements, life expectancy (LE) growth in Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has remained stagnant compared to other developed 
nations. This study aims to investigate the significant correlation between 
macroeconomic (ME), sociodemographic (SD), and health status and resources (HSR) 
factors and LE to formulate an explanatory model for Saudi Arabia and the UAE-a 
previously unexplored area. Utilizing an ecological, retrospective, time-series 
study design, we delved into secondary data on SD, ME, and HSR factors and LE of 
the populations of the UAE and Saudi Arabia spanning three decades (1980-2020). 
We employed partial least squares-structural equation modeling for statistical 
analysis. Our analysis revealed significant direct impacts of HSR factors on LE 
for Saudi Arabia (β = 0.958, p < 0.001) and the UAE (β = 0.716, p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, we discerned a notable indirect influence of ME factors on LE, 
mediated through SD and HSR factors for Saudi Arabia (β = 0.507, p < 0.001) and 
the UAE (β = 0.509, p < 0.001), along with a considerable indirect effect of SD 
factors on LE through HSR (Saudi: β = 0.529, p < 0.001; UAE: β = 0.711, p < 
0.001). This study underscores the mediating role of a nexus of ME-SD-HSR 
factors on LE in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Consequently, these findings signal 
an imperative need for holistic policy interventions addressing ME, SD, and HSR 
factors, aiming to alter health behaviors and improve LE projections for Saudi 
Arabia and the UAE in the long run.

Patients with a clinical indication for aortic valve replacement can either 
undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or Transcatheter Aortic Valve 
Implantation (TAVI). There are many different factors that go into determining 
which type of replacement to undergo, including age, life expectancy, 
comorbidities, frailty, and patient preference. While both options offer 
significant benefits to patients in terms of clinical outcomes and quality of 
life, there is growing interest in expanding the indications for TAVI due to its 
minimally invasive approach. However, it is worth noting that there are several 
discrepancies in TAVI outcomes in regards to various endpoints, including death, 
stroke, and major cardiovascular events. It is unclear why these discrepancies 
exist, but potential explanations include the diversity of etiologies for aortic 
stenosis, complex patient comorbidities, and ongoing advancements in both 
medical therapies and devices. Of these possibilities, we propose that 
phenotypic variation of aortic stenosis has the most significant impact on 
post-TAVI clinical outcomes. Such variability in phenotypes is often due to a 
complex interplay between underlying comorbidities and environmental and 
inherent patient risk factors. However, there is growing evidence to suggest 
that patient genetics may also play a role in aortic stenosis pathology. As 
such, we propose that the selection and management of TAVI patients should 
emphasize a precision medicine approach.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac 
arrhythmia. The estimated lifetime risk of developing AF is higher in men; 
however, due to differences in life expectancy, the overall prevalence is higher 
among women, particularly in the older age group. Sex differences play an 
important role in the pathophysiology, presentation, and clinical outcomes of 
AF. Awareness of these differences minimizes the potential for disparities in AF 
management. Our review summarizes the current literature on sex differences in 
AF, including the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical 
symptomatology, mechanisms, treatment, and outcomes. We also explore the 
implications of these differences for clinical practice and future research.
RECENT FINDINGS: Women are more likely to present with atypical symptoms, have a 
higher stroke risk, and have a worse quality of life with AF when compared to 
men. Despite this, they are less likely to receive rhythm control strategies and 
anticoagulants. The sex-based differences in AF pathology and management might 
be a combination of inherent biological and hormonal differences, and implicit 
bias of the research entities and treating clinicians. Our review stresses the 
need for further sex-specific research in the pathophysiology of AF and opens a 
dialogue on personalized medicine, where management strategies can be tailored 
to individual patient characteristics, including sex.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: India has one of the world's highest proportions of 
out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) payments. The low share of public health 
expenditure coupled with the double burden of disease (communicable and 
non-communicable) has a direct financial impact on individual OOPE and an 
indirect impact in the form of decreasing life expectancy, reduced productivity, 
and hence a negative impact on economic growth. This systematic review aims to 
compare and assess the estimated economic cost of non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) in India and ascertain the methods used to derive these estimates.
METHODS: This paper reviews the past 12-year (2010-22) literature on the 
economic impact of health shocks due to NCDs. Three databases were searched for 
the literature: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Thematic analysis has been 
performed to analyse the findings of the study.
RESULTS: The OOPE was very high for NCDs. The increasing cost was high and 
unaffordable, pushing many people into financial distress measured by 
catastrophic payments and rising impoverishment.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate both the direct and indirect impact of NCDs, 
but the indirect burden of loss of employment and productivity, despite its 
relevance, has been less studied in the literature. A robust economic analysis 
will allow an evidence-based policy decision perspective to reduce the rising 
burden of NCDs.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives have received 
extensive attention due to their negative effects on the environment and on 
human health. However, few studies have performed comprehensive assessments of 
PAHs emitted from pesticide factories. This study assessed the concentration, 
composition, and health risk of 52 PM2.5-bound PAHs during the daytime and 
nighttime in the vicinity of a typical pesticide factory. The total 
concentration of 52 PAHs (Σ52PAHs) ranged from 53.04 to 663.55 ng/m3. No 
significant differences were observed between daytime and nighttime PAH 
concentrations. The average concentrations of twenty-two parent PAHs, seven 
alkylated PAHs, ten oxygenated PAHs, and twelve nitrated PAHs were 112.55 ± 
89.69, 18.05 ± 13.76, 66.13 ± 54.79, and 3.90 ± 2.24 ng/m3, respectively. A 
higher proportion of high-molecular-weight (4-5 rings) PAHs than 
low-molecular-weight (2-3 rings) PAHs was observed. This was likely due to the 
high-temperature combustion of fuels. Analysis of diagnostic ratios indicated 
that the PAHs were likely derived from coal combustion and mixed sources. The 
total carcinogenic equivalent toxicity ranged from 15.93 to 181.27 ng/m3. The 
incremental lifetime cancer risk from inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact 
with the PAHs was 2.33 × 10-3 for men and 2.53 × 10-3 for women, and the loss of 
life expectancy due to the PAHs was 11,915 min (about 0.023 year) for men and 
12,952 min (about 0.025 year) for women. These results suggest that long-term 
exposure to PM2.5 emissions from a pesticide factory has significant adverse 
effects on health. The study results support implementing the characterization 
of PAH emissions from pesticide factories and provides a scientific basis for 
optimizing the living environment around pesticide factories.

(DLBCL) is characterized by chronic active B-cell receptor signaling and a 
constitutive activation of the NF-KB pathway. MYD88 L265P mutation occurs as a 
driving force of NF-KB overactivity in ABC-DLBCL. Nonetheless, in cases of 
DLBCL, the MYD88 L265P mutation has not yet been investigated in association 
with the tumour necrosis factor alpha induced protein3 (TNFAIP3) mutation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of MYD88 and TNFAIP3 mutations in DLBCL 
and their association to the clinico-hematological profile.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used real-time polymerase chain reaction in order to 
search for MYD88 L265P and TNFAIP3 mutations in 100 DLBCL patients.
RESULTS: MYD88 L265P In 20% of cases, the CT heterozygous genotype was 
discovered.  CT heterozygous genotype was more common in ABC type, stage IV, 
greater IPI groups, extra-nodal infiltration, and BM infiltration. It was also 
linked to a shorter OS. TNFAIP3 mutation GA heterozygous genotype was detected 
in 18% of the patients, with ABC-DLBCL subtype accounting for 77.8%. The GA 
heterozygous genotype was usually related with stage IV, extranodal 
infiltration, and a reduced life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: MYD88 L265P and to lesser extent TNFAIP3 mutations are major 
mutations in ABC- DLBCL and may be predictive factors for poor OS in ABC- DLBCL 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Adolescence (10-19 years) is a critical life period for growth and 
health. An increase in dietary diversity in the food is related to improved 
nutrient adequacy of the diet. However, studies conducted on dietary diversity 
practice among adolescents showed non-conclusive and inconsistent findings on 
the magnitude of the problem. Likewise, there was no meta-analysis conducted in 
the study area. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted 
to estimate the pooled prevalence of good dietary diversity practice and its 
associated factors among adolescents in Ethiopia.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guideline was followed. All articles were systematically searched by Google 
Scholar, PubMed, Hinari, Cochrane Library, Global Health and CINAHL. 
Meta-analysis was conducted by using STATA 14 software. Forest plots were used 
to present the pooled prevalence of good dietary diversity practices. A random 
effect model was used to compute the pooled prevalence; while subgroup analysis 
was performed to identify the possible source of heterogeneity. Publication bias 
was assessed by the begg's and egger's test. Moreover, the associated factor of 
dietary diversity practices was observed.
RESULTS: This review involved 7 studies, and 3,950 participants. The pooled 
prevalence of good dietary diversity practice among adolescents in Ethiopia was 
39.24% (95% CI: 30.82, 47.66). Mothers with formal education [AOR = 1.98, (95% 
CI: 1.65, 2.36)], fathers with formal education [AOR = 2.30, (95% CI: 1.81, 
2.93)], Medium wealth index [AOR = 2.75, (95% CI: 1.96, 3.86)] and urban 
residence [AOR = 2.88, (95% CI: 1.59, 5.22)] were positively associated with 
good dietary diversity practice.
CONCLUSIONS: The pooled prevalence of good dietary diversity practices among 
adolescents is low. Being urban residents, the medium wealth quintile, mothers' 
educational status and fathers' educational status were independent factors of 
good dietary diversity practice among adolescents. Therefore, focused 
nutritional interventions should be given to rural residents and adolescents 
from low economic status.

"Is free-roaming a key factor determining lifespan? An epidemiological study on 
the life expectancy of Turkish companion dogs".

Companion dog lifespan data has exclusively been studied in developed economies. 
Here we report results from n = 1312 privately owned Turkish companion dogs 
(Free-roaming and non Free-roaming) from an online survey analyzed through 
Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. Median survival time (MST) was 
13 years. Most common causes of death were viral infections (n = 126), cancer 
(n = 60), and cardiovascular disease (n = 36). Desexing (χ2 = 31.6, P = 2E-8), 
being a mixed breed (χ2 = 6.4, P = 0.01), and regular preventative care 
(χ2 = 5.3, P = 0.02) significantly increased lifespan. Roaming freely 
significantly decreased lifespan (χ2 = 19.5, P = 1E-5). Dogs living in duplexes 
and single-family homes lived longer than dogs living in apartments and houses 
on acreage (χ2 = 10.5, P = 0.01). Owner income or education levels did not 
correlate with lifespan. In a Cox model, only desexing (HR = 0.478, P = 0.0006), 
living in a house on acreage (HR = 2.30, P = 0.0064) and being allowed to roam 
freely (HR = 1.59, P = 0.041) remained significant. Even though there are 
studies that contain information about dog demographics and mortality data 
outside of the western countries, to our knowledge, this is the first study of 
factors that influence companion dog lifespan in a middle income economy. While 
much of our findings correlate with those from developed economies, our sample 
also lets us study the effects of factors not commonly found in developed 
economies on dog lifespan, such as being allowed to roam freely.

BACKGROUND: Quick symptomatic remission after the onset of psychotic symptoms is 
critical in schizophrenia treatment, determining the subsequent disease course 
and recovery. In this context, only every second patient with acute 
schizophrenia achieves symptomatic remission within three months of initiating 
antipsychotic treatment. The potential indication extension of clozapine-the 
most effective antipsychotic-to be introduced at an earlier stage (before 
treatment-resistance) is supported by several lines of evidence, but respective 
clinical trials are lacking.
METHODS: Two hundred-twenty patients with acute non-treatment-resistant 
schizophrenia will be randomized in this double-blind, 8-week parallel-group 
multicentric trial to either clozapine or olanzapine. The primary endpoint is 
the number of patients in symptomatic remission at the end of week 8 according 
to international consensus criteria ('Andreasen criteria'). Secondary endpoints 
and other assessments comprise a comprehensive safety assessment (i. e., 
myocarditis screening), changes in psychopathology, global functioning, 
cognition, affective symptoms and quality of life, and patients' and relatives' 
views on treatment.
DISCUSSION: This multicentre trial aims to examine whether clozapine is more 
effective than a highly effective second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), 
olanzapine, in acute schizophrenia patients who do not meet the criteria for 
treatment-naïve or treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Increasing the likelihood 
to achieve symptomatic remission in acute schizophrenia can improve the overall 
outcome, reduce disease-associated burden and potentially prevent mid- and 
long-term disease chronicity.

BACKGROUND: The acceleration of aging and the increase in life expectancy have 
resulted in an increasing number of older adults developing physical and mental 
comorbidities. We examined the association between depression and quality of 
life (QoL) using cognitive impairment (COI) as a mediator and sleep quality (SQ) 
as a moderator among older adults with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: A total of 2646 participants from Weifang, Shandong, China completed 
the survey. Their depression, cognitive function, SQ, and QoL were assessed. 
PROCESS was used to investigate mediating and moderating effects.
RESULTS: COI mediated the association between depression and QoL (indirect 
effect = -0.1058, bootstrapped 95 % CI [-0.1417, -0.0725]). Moderated mediation 
analyses indicated that SQ moderated the first half of the pathway of 
depression's impact on QoL through COI (moderating effect = -0.1128, 
bootstrapped 95 % CI [-0.1981, -0.0348]). Depression negatively impacted 
cognitive function in participants with poor (vs. better) SQ.
LIMITATIONS: First, multiple assessment tools should be considered to increase 
objective assessment. Second, the cross-sectional design limited our ability to 
make causal inferences. Third, additional diabetes-related variables should be 
included to explore this relationship. Finally, the pathways of influence and 
mechanisms of action of COI in older adults should be explored further.
CONCLUSION: Depression could impair the QoL of older adults by aggravating their 
COI. Fortunately, improving patients' SQ may undermine this negative effect. 
These findings may play an integral role in promoting the psychiatric health of 
older adults with type 2 diabetes.

Owing to the continuous increase in human life expectancy, the management of 
aging-related diseases has become an urgent issue. The brain dominates the 
central nervous system; therefore, brain aging is a key area of aging-related 
research. We previously uncovered that dendritic cell factor 1 (Dcf1) maintains 
the stemness of neural stem cells and its expression in Drosophila can prolong 
lifespan, suggesting an association between Dcf1 and aging; however, the 
specific underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we 
show for the first time that hippocampal neurogenesis is decreased in aged 
Dcf1-/- mice, which leads to a decrease in the number of brain neurons and an 
increased number of senescent cells. Moreover, astrocytes proliferate abnormally 
and express elevated mRNA levels of aging-related factors, in addition to 
displaying increased activation of Akt and Foxo3a. Finally, behavioral tests 
confirm that aged Dcf1-/- mice exhibit a significant decline in cognitive 
abilities related to learning and memory. In conclusion, we reveal a novel 
mechanism underlying brain aging triggered by Dcf1 deficiency at the molecular, 
cellular, tissue, and behavioral levels, providing a new perspective for the 
exploration of brain aging.

Finding its place on the spectrum of pituitary duplication disorders, 
duplication of pituitary stalk: A case report with brief review of literature.

Pituitary gland duplication is a rare abnormality and isolated duplication of 
the pituitary stalk without any pituitary anomaly is an even rarer entity with 
this case being the first documented case till date. Although incidentally 
discovered cases of duplication of pituitary gland (DPG) have been reported, 
sometimes with a duplicated pituitary stalk, patients with this disorder usually 
present with other craniofacial abnormalities. Consequently, DPG plus syndrome 
is used as it is often accompanied by endocrine disturbances and pathologies 
such as median cleft face syndrome, ocular disorders, craniocervical bony 
abnormalities, vascular anomalies and tuberomammillary masses. Since this is the 
first reported case without any additional pituitary gland anomaly, we propose 
the acronym DPS (duplication of pituitary stalk) to be used to unify this entity 
as we are certain that much like the previously described pituitary duplication 
disorders, more cases will be documented independently rather than under the 
umbrella of pituitary duplication disorders. This is critical as the life 
expectancy (age of diagnosis) in the cases reviewed in our study is as good as 
normal population with no obvious increase in mortality as compared to existing 
pituitary duplication syndromes. We present a case report of a 2 year 7 month 
old girl who was referred by the paediatrician for evaluation of premature 
thelarche. The duplication of the pituitary stalk along with mega cisterna magna 
and tuberomammillary fusion was the only positive finding on imaging with the 
pituitary gland being absolutely normal.

INTRODUCTION: Waiting until a person is very near end of life to discuss limited 
life expectancy risks lower goal-concordant care and increased utilization of 
medical interventions with lower likelihood of benefit at the end of life. 
Medical training on communication skills in serious illness often focuses on 
early and late conversations regarding prognosis, with no guidance on navigating 
the conversations occurring in the middle of the illness course.
GOAL OF THE REVIEW: We propose a new framework for identifying and discussing 
prognosis at various points along the cancer course, as a continuum from 
beginning to end, that is prompted by changes in clinical status and number of 
available remaining cancer directed interventions.
DISCUSSION: SPIKES is a framework utilized for early conversations in a cancer 
course. REMAP is a framework utilization for late conversations in a cancer 
course. There is a gap in guidance on how to navigate conversations that occur 
between the early and late phases of a cancer course. We describe 3 general 
phases of care during a cancer course ("early," "middle," and "late"), with each 
phase warranting specific communication skills in order to improve patient 
understanding of prognosis, goal concordant care, and best practices for 
healthcare utilization in the acute and end of life care settings.
CONCLUSION: Framing prognosis by available medical interventions through a 
framework of "early," "middle," and "late" adds clarity to the phase of illness, 
expectations around delivery of information to the patient, and framing of 
recommendations at each given phase.

Etiological investigation of hyperferritinemia includes a full clinical 
examination, with the measurement of waist circumference, and simple biological 
tests including transferrin saturation. The classification between 
hyperferritinemia without iron overload (inflammation, excessive alcohol intake, 
cytolysis, L-ferritin mutation) or with iron overload is then relatively easy. 
Dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome is the most common iron overload disease and 
is defined by an unexplained serum ferritin level elevation associated with 
various metabolic syndrome criteria and mild hepatic iron content increase 
assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Bloodlettings are often poorly tolerated 
without clear benefit. Type 1 genetic hemochromatosis (homozygous C282Y mutation 
on the HFE gene) leads to iron accumulation through an increase of dietary iron 
absorption due to hypohepcidinemia. More than 95% of hemochromatosis are type 1 
hemochromatosis but the phenotypic expression is highly variable. Elastography 
is recommended to identify advanced hepatic fibrosis when serum ferritin exceeds 
1000μg/L. Life expectancy is normal when bloodlettings are started early. 
Ferroportin gene mutation is an autosomal dominant disease with generally 
moderate iron overload. Chelators are used in iron overload associated with 
anaemia (myelodysplastic syndromes or transfusion-dependent thalassemia). 
Chelation is initiated when hepatic iron content exceeds 120μmol/g. Deferasirox 
is often used as first-line therapy, but deferiprone may be of interest despite 
haematological toxicity (neutropenia). Deferoxamine (parenteral route) is the 
treatment of choice for severe iron overload or emergency conditions.
