flexible basis function for subject-level trajectories and a competing-risks 
sub-model for multiple time-to event outcomes. The different association 
structures can be accomplished through a time-dependent function of shared 
random effects from the longitudinal process or the whole longitudinal history 
in the competing-risks sub-model. The proposed joint model that utilizes basis 
function and competing-risks sub-model is an extension of the standard linear 
joint models. The application results from the proposed joint model can supply 
some useful clinical references for chronic kidney disease study post kidney 
transplantation.

BACKGROUND: The use of wearable biosensor devices for monitoring and coaching in 
forensic psychiatric settings yields high expectations for improved 
self-regulation of emotions and behavior in clients and staff members. More so, 
if clients have mild intellectual disabilities (IQ 50-85), they might benefit 
from these biosensors as they are easy to use in everyday life, which ensures 
that clients can practice with the devices in multiple stress and 
arousal-inducing situations. However, research on (continuous) use and 
acceptance of biosensors in forensic psychiatry for clients with mild 
intellectual disabilities and their caretakers is scarce. Although wearable 
biosensors show promise for health care, recent research showed that the 
acceptance and continuous use of wearable devices in consumers is not as was 
anticipated, probably due to low expectations.
OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study was to investigate the associations 
between and determinants of the expectation of usability, the actual experienced 
usability, and the intention for continuous use of biosensors.
METHODS: A total of 77 participants (31 forensic clients with mild intellectual 
disabilities and 46 forensic staff members) participated in a 1-week trial. 
Preceding the study, we selected 4 devices thought to benefit the participants 
in domains of self-regulation, physical health, or sleep. Qualitative and 
quantitative questionnaires were used that explored the determinants of 
usability, acceptance, and continuous use of biosensors. Questionnaires 
consisted of the System Usability Scale, the Technology Acceptance Model 
questionnaire, and the extended expectation confirmation model questionnaire.
RESULTS: Only the experienced usability of the devices was associated with 
intended continuous use. Forensic clients scored higher on acceptance and 
intention for continuous use than staff members. Moderate associations were 
found between usability with acceptance and continuous use. Staff members showed 
stronger associations between usability and acceptance (r=.80, P<.001) and 
usability and continuous use (r=.79, P<.001) than clients, who showed more 
moderate correlations between usability and acceptance (r=.46, P=.01) and 
usability and continuous use (r=.52, P=.003). The qualitative questionnaires in 
general indicated that the devices were easy to use and gave clear information.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, it was the actual perceived usability of 
wearing a biosensor that was associated with continuous use and to a much lesser 
extent the expectancy of usability. Clients scored higher on acceptance and 
intention for continuous use, but associations between usability and both 
acceptance and continuous use were markedly stronger in staff members. This 
study provides clear directions on how to further investigate these 
associations. For example, whether this is a true effect or due to a social 
desirability bias in the client group must be investigated. Clients with mild 
intellectual disabilities might benefit from the ease of use of these devices 
and their continuing monitoring and coaching apps. For these clients, it is 
especially important to develop easy-to-use biosensors with a minimum 
requirement on cognitive capacity to increase usability, acceptance, and 
continuous use.

IMPORTANCE: A carotid web (CW) is a shelf-like lesion along the posterior wall 
of the internal carotid artery bulb and an underrecognized cause of young 
stroke. Several studies suggest that patients with symptomatic CW have a high 
risk of recurrent stroke, but high-quality data are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the 2-year risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a 
symptomatic CW.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A comparative cohort study used data from the 
MR CLEAN trial (from 2010-2014) and MR CLEAN Registry (from 2014-2017). Data 
were analyzed in September 2020. The MR CLEAN trial and MR CLEAN Registry were 
nationwide prospective multicenter studies on endovascular treatment (EVT) of 
large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke in the Netherlands. Baseline data were from 
3439 consecutive adult patients with anterior circulation LVO stroke and 
available computed tomography (CT)-angiography of the carotid bulb. Two 
neuroradiologists reevaluated CT-angiography images for presence or absence of 
CW and identified 30 patients with CW ipsilateral to the index stroke. For these 
30 eligible CW participants, detailed follow-up data regarding stroke recurrence 
within 2 years were acquired. These 30 patients with CW ipsilateral to the index 
stroke were compared with 168 patients without CW who participated in the MR 
CLEAN extended follow-up trial and who were randomized to the EVT arm.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was recurrent stroke occurring 
within 2 years after the index stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression 
models were used to compare recurrent stroke rates within 2 years for patients 
with and without CW, adjusted for age and sex. The research question was 
formulated prior to data collection.
RESULTS: Of 3439 patients with baseline CT-angiography assessed, the median age 
was 72 years (interquartile range, 61-80 years) and 1813 (53%) were men. 
Patients with CW were younger (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years 
vs 66 [interquartile range, 56-77] years; P = .02 and more often women (22 of 30 
[73%] vs 67 of 168 [40%]; P = .001) than patients without CW. Twenty-eight of 30 
patients (93%) received medical management after the index stroke (23 with 
antiplatelet therapy and 5 with anticoagulant therapy). During 2 years of 
follow-up, 5 of 30 patients (17%) with CW had a recurrent stroke compared with 5 
of 168 patients (3%) without CW (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.4-18.1).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, 1 of 6 patients with a symptomatic CW 
had a recurrent stroke within 2 years, suggesting that medical management alone 
may not provide sufficient protection for patients with CW.

Along with the evolutionary breakthrough of RNA interference and the 
applicability for gene knockdown, a subsequent development in siRNA-based 
therapeutics has been attained. The gene therapy based on RNAi is in transition 
progress from the research aspects to clinical base. Being a potent tool, siRNA 
is used as therapeutic against several disorders. Cancer which is one of the 
deadliest diseases is now treated with an advanced mechanism of siRNA delivery 
inside the genome, leading to gene silencing; thereby, blocking translation of 
gene to form protein. siRNA tool delivers remedial effects with the advantages 
of safe delivery and efficiency. Despite its merits, barriers including 
instability at physiological conditions, lack of ability to cross biological 
membranes, off-targets, and safety are also associated with siRNA delivery 
system. The gene silencing efficiency values both in vitro and in vivo reported 
in the past years have been reviewed by material type (lipid, polymer, silica, 
porous silicon, and metal). This review presents a deep insight in the 
development of targeted delivery of siRNA. Since several clinical trials have 
also been performed regarding the siRNA delivery against cancer, it can also be 
stated that the delivery system should be good enough to achieve effective siRNA 
drug development.

BACKGROUND: Preoperative prediction of extracapsular extension (ECE) of prostate 
cancer (PCa) is important to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient 
prognosis.
PURPOSE: To investigate the value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging 
(mpMRI)-based peritumoral radiomics for preoperative prediction of the presence 
of ECE.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: Two hundred eighty-four patients with PCa from two centers (center 
1: 226 patients; center 2: 58 patients). Cases from center 1 were randomly 
divided into training (158 patients) and internal validation (68 patients) sets. 
Cases from center 2 were assigned to the external validation set.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3.0 T MRI scanners (three vendors). Sequence: Pelvic 
T2-weighted turbo/fast spin echo sequence and diffusion weighted echo planar 
imaging sequence.
ASSESSMENT: The peritumoral region (PTR) was obtained by 3-12 mm (half of the 
tumor length) 3D dilatation of the intratumoral region (ITR). Single-MRI 
radiomics signatures, mpMRI radiomics signatures, and integrated models, which 
combined clinical characteristics with the radiomics signatures were built. The 
discrimination ability was assessed by area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal and external validation sets.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U-test, DeLong test.
RESULTS: The PTR radiomics signatures demonstrated significantly better 
performance than the corresponding ITR radiomics signatures (AUC: 0.674 
vs. 0.554, P < 0.05 on T2-weighted, 0.652 vs. 0.546, P < 0.05 on apparent 
diffusion coefficient, 0.682 vs. 0.556 on mpMRI in the external validation set). 
The integrated models combining the PTR radiomics signature with clinical 
characteristics performed better than corresponding radiomics signatures in the 
internal validation set (eg. AUC: 0.718 vs. 0.671, P < 0.05 on mpMRI) but 
performed similar in the external validation set (eg. AUC: 0.684, vs. 0.682, 
P = 0.45 on mpMRI).
DATA CONCLUSION: The peritumoral radiomics can better predict the presence of 
ECE preoperatively compared with the intratumoral radiomics and may have better 
generalization than clinical characteristics. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 4 
TECHNICAL EFFICACY: 2.

Do Loneliness and Perceived Social Isolation Reduce Expected Longevity and 
Increase the Frequency of Dealing with Death and Dying? Longitudinal Findings 
based on a Nationally Representative Sample.

OBJECTIVES: Loneliness and social isolation are important factors for morbidity 
and mortality. However, little is known about whether increases in loneliness 
and perceived social isolation contribute to decreased expectations of longevity 
and an increased frequency of dealing with death and dying. Consequently, our 
aim was to clarify these relationships.
DESIGN: Longitudinal data were derived from a nationally representative sample 
of individuals ≥40 years (analytical sample, n=7952 observations).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals aged ≥40 years.
METHODS: Loneliness and perceived social isolation were both measured using 
well-established tools. In accordance with other large cohort studies, the 
expectations of longevity were assessed using the question "What age do you 
think you will live to?" Moreover, the frequency of dealing with death and dying 
(from 1 = never to 5 = very often) served as outcome measure. In regression 
analysis, it was adjusted for several sociodemographic and health-related 
factors.
RESULTS: Fixed effects regressions showed that both increases in loneliness 
(β = -0.99, P < .001) and in perceived social isolation (β = -0.59, P < .05) 
were associated with decreases in expectations of longevity. Furthermore, both 
loneliness [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.02, P < .05] and perceived social 
isolation (IRR = 1.02, P < .05) were associated with increases in the frequency 
of dealing with death and dying.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Beyond the impact of various covariates, findings 
still point to a longitudinal association between both perceived social 
isolation and loneliness and lower expectations of longevity as well as an 
increased frequency of dealing with death and dying. Efforts in reducing 
loneliness and perceived social isolation can contribute to increased expected 
longevity and a decreased frequency of dealing with death and dying which 
ultimately can contribute to longevity in older age.

BACKGROUND: The maintenance treatment of ESRD puts a great burden on individual 
patients, society, and the country of China as a whole. Hemoperfusion plus 
hemodialysis (HP + HD) in ESRD patients can yield modified outcomes such as 
prolonged life expectancy and improved dialysis quality and quality of life. 
This study aimed to systematically analyze the effect of HP + HD on the overall 
survival (OS) rates of ESRD patients and to provide support for clinical 
decision-making.
METHODS: A computerized search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
Library, CNKI, WanFang Data and SinoMed databases for relevant original research 
articles. Studies were included or excluded based on their compliance with 
predefined selection criteria.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 
quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). The meta-analysis showed that the 1-year 
OS rate (odds ratio [OR]: 3.35, 95% CI: 1.89, 5.91, p < 0.05), 2-year OS rate 
(OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.84, 4.53, p < 0.05), and 5-year OS rate (χ2 = 4.3092, p < 
0.05) of patients with ESRD treated with HP + HD were better than those treated 
with HD, but there was no significant difference in 3-year OS rate (OR: 1.97, 
95% CI: 0.76, 5.06, p > 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed the same outcomes in 
different study designs (1-year OS rate: randomized controlled trials [RCTs]: 
OR: 4.38, 95% CI: 1.61, 11.88, p < 0.05; cohort studies: OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.44, 
5.85, p < 0.05; 2-year OS rate: RCTs: OR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.84, 4.84, p < 0.05) 
and different age-groups (1-year OS rate: 45-50 years: OR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.55, 
6.57, p < 0.05; 55-60 years: OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 10.61, p < 0.05; 2-year OS 
rate: 50-55 years: OR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.16, p < 0.05: 60-65 years: OR: 
4.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 16.30, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the OS rates of ESRD patients 
treated with HP + HD were better than those of patients treated with HD. A 
speculative hypothesis for why this is the case may be that HP + HD can achieve 
the complementary elimination of metabolites, effectively preventing and

expectancy. Therefore, HP + HD should be widely used in ESRD patients.

Patients with a limited life expectancy have an increased risk of thromboembolic 
and bleeding complications. Anticoagulants are often continued until death, 
independent of their original indication. We aimed to identify the opinions of 
physicians about the use of anticoagulants at the end of life. A mixed-method 
research design was used. A secondary analysis was performed on data from a 
vignette study and an interview study. Participants included general 
practitioners and clinical specialists. Physicians varied in their opinions: 
some would continue and others would stop anticoagulants at the end of life 
because of the risk of thromboembolic or bleeding complications. The improvement 
or preservation of patients' quality of life was a reason for both stopping and 
continuing anticoagulants. Other factors considered in the decision-making were 
the types of anticoagulant, the indication for which the anticoagulant was 
prescribed, underlying diseases, and the condition and life expectancy of the 
patient. Factors that made decision-making difficult were the lack of evidence 
on either strategy, uncertainty about patients' life expectancy, and the fear of 
harming patients. Which decision was eventually made seems largely dependent on 
the choice of the patient. In conclusion, there is a substantial variation in 
physicians' opinions regarding the use of anticoagulants in patients with a 
limited life expectancy. Physicians agree that the primary goal of medical care 
at end of life is the improvement or preservation of patients' quality of life. 
An important barrier to decision-making is the lack of evidence about the risks 
and benefits of stopping anticoagulants.

BACKGROUND: Innovations in single cell technologies have lead to a flurry of 
datasets and computational tools to process and interpret them, including 
analyses of cell composition changes and transition in cell states. The diffcyt 
workflow for differential discovery in cytometry data consist of several steps, 
including preprocessing, cell population identification and differential testing 
for an association with a binary or continuous covariate. However, the commonly 
measured quantity of survival time in clinical studies often results in a 
censored covariate where classical differential testing is inapplicable.
RESULTS: To overcome this limitation, multiple methods to directly include 
censored covariates in differential abundance analysis were examined with the 
use of simulation studies and a case study. Results show that multiple 
imputation based methods offer on-par performance with the Cox proportional 
hazards model in terms of sensitivity and error control, while offering 
flexibility to account for covariates. The tested methods are implemented in the 
R package censcyt as an extension of diffcyt and are available at 
https://bioconductor.org/packages/censcyt .
CONCLUSION: Methods for the direct inclusion of a censored variable as a 
predictor in GLMMs are a valid alternative to classical survival analysis 
methods, such as the Cox proportional hazard model, while allowing for more 
flexibility in the differential analysis.

BACKGROUND: Developing since colonisation, Australia's healthcare system has 
dismissed an ongoing and successful First Nations health paradigm in place for 
60,000 years. From Captain James Cook documenting 'very old' First Nations 
Peoples being 'far more happier than we Europeans' and Governor Arthur Phillip 
naming Manly in admiration of the physical health of Gadigal men of the Eora 
Nation, to anthropologist Daisy Bates' observation of First Nations Peoples 
living 'into their eighties' and having a higher life expectancy than Europeans; 
our healthcare system's shameful cultural safety deficit has allowed for an 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child born in Australia today to expect to 
live 9 years less than a non-Indigenous child. Disproportionately negative 
healthcare outcomes including early onset diabetes-related foot disease and high 
rates of lower limb amputation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples 
contribute to this gross inequity.
MAIN BODY: In 2020, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Authority 
released the National Scheme's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and 
Cultural Safety Strategy 2020-2025 - empowering all registered health 
practitioners within Australia to provide health care to Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Peoples that is inclusive, respectful and safe, as judged by the 
recipient of care. This recently released strategy is critically important to 
the podiatry profession in Australia. As clinicians, researchers and educators 
we have a collective responsibility to engage with this strategy of cultural 
safety. This commentary defines cultural safety for podiatry and outlines the 
components of the strategy in the context of our profession. Discussion 
considers the impact of the strategy on podiatry. It identifies mechanisms for 
podiatrists in all settings to facilitate safer practice, thereby advancing 
healthcare to produce more equitable outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples access health services 
more frequently and have better health outcomes where provision of care is 
culturally safe. By engaging with the National Scheme's Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Health and Cultural Safety Strategy, all registered podiatrists 
in Australia can contribute to achieving equity in health outcomes for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.

BACKGROUND: Rare diseases are pathologies that affect less than 1 in 2000 
people. They are difficult to diagnose due to their low frequency and their 
often highly heterogeneous symptoms. Rare diseases have in general a high impact 
on the quality of life and life expectancy of patients, which are in general 
children or young people. The advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques 
has improved diagnosis in several different areas, from pediatrics, achieving a 
diagnostic rate of 41% with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and 36% with whole 
exome sequencing, to neurology, achieving a diagnostic rate between 47 and 48.5% 
with WGS. This evidence has encouraged our group to pursue a molecular diagnosis 
using WGS for this and several other patients with rare diseases.
RESULTS: We used whole genome sequencing to achieve a molecular diagnosis of a 
7-year-old girl with a severe panvascular artery disease that remained for 
several years undiagnosed. We found a frameshift variant in one copy and a large 
deletion involving two exons in the other copy of a gene called YY1AP1. This 
gene is related to Grange syndrome, a recessive rare disease, whose symptoms 
include stenosis or occlusion of multiple arteries, congenital heart defects, 
brachydactyly, syndactyly, bone fragility, and learning disabilities. 
Bioinformatic analyses propose these mutations as the most likely cause of the 
disease, according to its frequency, in silico predictors, conservation 
analyses, and effect on the protein product. Additionally, we confirmed one 
mutation in each parent, supporting a compound heterozygous status in the child.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, we think that this finding can contribute to the use of 
whole genome sequencing as a diagnosis tool of rare diseases, and in particular, 
it can enhance the set of known mutations associated with different diseases.

Why do women live longer than men? Here, we mine rich lodes of demographic data 
to reveal that lower female mortality at particular ages is decisive-and that 
the important ages changed around 1950. Earlier, excess mortality among baby 
boys was crucial; afterward, the gap largely resulted from elevated mortality 
among men 60+. Young males bear modest responsibility for the sex gap in life 
expectancy: Depending on the country and time, their mortality accounts for less 
than a quarter and often less than a 10th of the gap. Understanding the impact 
on life expectancy of differences between male and female risks of death by age, 
over time, and across populations yields insights for research on how the lives 
of men and women differ.

HMGB1-like dorsal switch protein 1 of the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, acts as a 
damage-associated molecular pattern.

University, Andong, Korea.

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein highly conserved in 
eukaryotes and ubiquitously expressed to regulate transcription and chromatin 
remodeling. Dorsal switch protein 1 (DSP1) is its insect homolog. A lepidopteran 
DSP1 acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in response to immune 
challenge. The objective of this study was to determine the role of DAMP in the 
mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, a coleopteran insect. DSP1 of T. molitor 
(Tm-DSP1) encodes 536 amino acids and shares sequence similarities with Homo 
sapiens HMGB1 (56.3%) and Spodoptera exigua DSP1 (59.2%). An antisera raised 
against S. exigua DSP1 was cross-reactive to Tm-DSP1. Like other insect DSPs, 
Tm-DSP1 has a relatively long N-terminal extension in addition to two conserved 
HMG box domains. It was expressed in all developmental stages of T. molitor and 
different larval tissues. Upon immune challenge, its expression level was 
upregulated. Its RNA interference (RNAi) treatment resulted in a significant 
reduction in immune responses measured by hemocyte nodule formation against 
bacterial infection. In addition, the induction of some antimicrobial peptide 
genes to the immune challenge was suppressed by its RNAi treatment. 
Interestingly, phospholipase A2 associated with eicosanoid biosynthesis was 
significantly suppressed in its catalytic activity by the RNAi treatment 
specific to Tm-DSP1 expression. Without any pathogen infection, injection of a 
lepidopteran DSP1 induced both cellular and humoral immune responses. These 
results suggest that Tm-DSP1 in T. molitor can act as a DAMP molecule and 
mediate immune responses upon immune challenge.

AIM: Clinical trials suggest that hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose (HA/CMC) 
prevents adhesion-related complications after intra-abdominal surgery, but at a 
high upfront cost. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HA/CMC for 
patients undergoing curative-intent open colorectal cancer surgery.
METHODS: Using a Markov Monte Carlo microsimulation model, we conducted a 
cost-utility analysis comparing the cost-effectiveness of HA/CMC at 
curative-intent open colorectal cancer surgery versus standard management. We 
considered a scenario where HA/CMC was used at the index operation only, as well 
as where it was used at the index operation and any subsequent operations. The 
perspective was that of the third-party payer. Costs and utilities were 
discounted 1.5% annually, with a 1-month cycle length and 5-year time horizon. 
Model input data were obtained from a literature review. Outcomes included cost, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), small bowel obstructions (SBOs) and 
operations for SBO.
RESULTS: Using HA/CMC at the index operation results in an incremental cost 
increase of CA$316 and provides 0.001 additional QALYs, for an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of CA$310,000 per QALY compared to standard management. 
In our simulated cohort of 10,000 patients, HA/CMC prevented 460 SBOs and 293 
surgeries for SBO. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that HA/CMC was 
cost-effective in 18.5% of iterations, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
CA$50,000 per QALY. Results of the scenario analysis where HA/CMC was used at 
the index operation and any subsequent operations were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose prevents adhesive bowel 
obstruction after open colorectal cancer surgery but is unlikely to be 
cost-effective given minimal long-term impact on healthcare costs and QALYs.

Survival prediction for palliative cancer patients by physicians is often 
optimistic. Patients with a very short life expectancy (<4 weeks) may not 
benefit from radiation therapy (RT), as the time to maximal symptom relief after 
treatment can take 4-6 weeks. We aimed to identify a prognostic tool (or tools) 
to predict survival of less than 4 weeks and less than 3 months in patients with 
advanced cancer to guide the choice of radiation dose and fractionation. We 
searched Embase, Medline (EBSCOhost) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) clinical databases 
for literature published between January 2008 and June 2018. Seventeen studies 
met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Prediction accuracy 
at less than 4 weeks and less than 3 months were compared across the prognostic 
tools. Reporting of prediction accuracy among the different studies was not 
consistent: the Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP), Palliative Prognostic Index 
(PPI) and Number of Risk Factors (NRF) best-predicted survival duration of less 
than 4 weeks. The PPI, performance status with Palliative Prognostic Index 
(PS-PPI), NRF and Survival Prediction Score (SPS) may predict 3-month survival. 
We recommend PPI and PaP tools to assess the likelihood of a patient surviving 
less than 4 weeks. If predicted to survive longer and RT is justified, the NRF 
tool could be used to determine survival probability less than 3 months which 
can then help clinicians select dose and fractionation. Future research is 
needed to verify the reliability of survival prediction using these prognostic 
tools in a radiation oncology setting.

Changing epidemiology of calcific aortic valve disease: 30-year trends of 
incidence, prevalence, and deaths across 204 countries and territories.

Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality. We aimed to elucidate the 30-year epidemiology of CAVD globally. 
Global CAVD incidence, prevalence, and deaths increased 3.51-, 4.43-, and 
1.38-fold from 1990 to 2019, respectively, without any decreasing trends, even 
after age standardization. In 2019, Slovenia had the highest age-standardized 
rate (ASR) of CAVD incidence (62.21/100,000 persons) and prevalence 
(1,080.06/100,000) whereas Cyprus had the highest ASR of deaths (8.20/100,000). 
Population aging was an important contributor to incidence. Compared with women, 
more men had CAVD and men had earlier peaks in disease prevalence. High systolic 
blood pressure, diet high in sodium, and lead exposure were the main risk 
factors for deaths owing to CAVD. The estimated annual percentage change, a 
measure to estimate the variation of ASR, was significantly associated with the 
ASR and sociodemographic index (SDI) in 2019 for incidence and prevalence across 
all 204 countries and territories (all p<0.0001). With increased lifespan and 
risk factors, the overall burden of CAVD is high and remains on the rise, with 
differences by sex, age, and SDI level. Our findings serve to sound the alarm 
for organizations, institutions, and resources whose primary purpose is to 
improve human health.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictive and criterion-based validity of the 
Cervantes-SF scale that measures the impact of menopause on Health-Related 
Quality of Life.
METHODS: We recruited a noninstitutionalized sample of peri/postmenopausal women 
aged 40 to 65 years, who had their last menstrual cycle 12+ months prior to 
inclusion in the study of the psychometric validity of the Cervantes-SF scale. 
Predictive validity of the scale was confirmed for various health outcome 
measures administered concomitantly (years of disability-free life expectancy, 
work productivity and impact on daily activities, economic impact arising from 
loss of work productivity, hours of undisturbed sleep each day, and the 
utilization of healthcare facilities), whilst criterion validity was determined 
by the likelihood of identifying a moderate-to-severe vasomotor or genital 
syndrome requiring specific treatment.
RESULTS: A sample of 308 peri/postmenopausal women with a mean age of 55.7 years 
(SD: 5.3 y) was analyzed in this study. A score >25 points on the dimension of 
vasomotor problems (or menopausal health) showed values of sensitivity and 
specificity > 80% for identifying women with moderate-severe vasomotor syndrome 
requiring pharmacological treatment. Predictive validity was confirmed for 
menopause-related health outcomes. A change of 6.7 points in the scale score, 
equivalent to the value of its minimal difference, is indicative of a 
significant increase in the degree of disability regarding work/day-to-day 
activities, greater economic loss due to decreased work productivity, fewer 
years of life expectancy without disability, fewer hours of undisturbed sleep, 
and more visits to the physician per year due to menopausal symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the criterion and predictive validity of the 
Cervantes-SF scale in peri/postmenopausal women.
