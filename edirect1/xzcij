BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected cancer patients are less likely to receive cancer treatment. The 
extent to which this disparity affects the growing population of elderly 
individuals is unknown and factors that mediate these treatment differences have 
not been explored.
METHODS: We studied 930359 Americans aged 66-99 years who were diagnosed with 10 
common cancers. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare claims from 
1991 to 2011 were used to determine HIV status and receipt of cancer treatment 
in 6 months following diagnosis. Mediation analysis was conducted to estimate 
the direct effect of HIV, and indirect effect through cancer stage at diagnosis 
and comorbidities, on cancer treatment.
RESULTS: HIV-infected individuals (n = 687) were less likely to receive cancer 
treatment (70% vs 75% HIV uninfected; P < .01). This difference was larger in 
individuals aged 66-70 years, among whom only 65% were treated (vs 81% in HIV 
uninfected; P < .01), and time from cancer diagnosis to treatment was longer 
(median, 42.5 vs 36 days in HIV uninfected; P < .01). Accounting for potential 
confounders, HIV-infected individuals aged 66-70 years remained 20% less likely 
to receive cancer treatment (hazard ratio, 0.81 [95% confidence interval, 
.71-.92]). Seventy-five percent of this total effect was due to HIV itself, with 
a nonsignificant 24% mediated by cancer stage and comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Lowest cancer treatment rates were seen in the younger subset of 
HIV-infected individuals, who would likely benefit most from treatment in terms 
of life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge regarding the economic outcomes of anti-tumour necrosis 
factor-α (anti-TNFα) and oral Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) therapies for the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) is limited. We conducted this analysis to 
assess the economic outcomes of anti-TNFα, antiadhesion molecule inhibitors 
(anti-AMi), and oral JAKi therapies for the treatment of UC from the 
perspectives of the United Kingdom (UK) and China, which are the representatives 
of high-income and middle-income regions, respectively.
METHODS: A Markov model-based economic analysis was performed by incorporating 
effectiveness and utility data obtained from the literature and costs based on 
publicly available reports. The UK and Chinese health care perspectives were 
adopted to evaluate different intervention treatment sequences, including 14 
treatment sequences consisting of conventional therapy, tofacitinib, adalimumab, 
vedolizumab, golimumab, and infliximab. The participants were the patients with 
moderate-to-severe UC eligible for anti-TNFα, anti-Ami, and JAKi treatment. 
Cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were reported.
RESULTS: Compared to other alternatives comprising adalimumab, golimumab, and 
infliximab, the use of a treatment sequence comprising tofacitinib and 
vedolizumab always had better health outcomes. The most cost-effective options 
in the UK included the sequences comprising tofacitinib and vedolizumab, and the 
most cost-effective treatment option in China was tofacitinib. There were 
uncertainties surrounding the results, the key drivers of which being the 
utility values, effectiveness of conventional therapy, and relative efficacy of 
the active treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with tofacitinib and vedolizumab for 
moderate-to-severe UC is likely to be the most favorable cost-effective option 
in the high-income UK, and tofacitinib is the most cost-effective option in the 
middle-income China.

One of the key tenets of life-history theory is that reproduction and survival 
are linked and that they trade-off with each other. When dietary resources are 
limited, reduced reproduction with a concomitant increase in survival is 
commonly observed. It is often hypothesized that this dietary restriction effect 
results from strategically reduced investment in reproduction in favor of 
somatic maintenance to survive starvation periods until resources become 
plentiful again. We used experimental evolution to test this 
"waiting-for-the-good-times" hypothesis, which predicts that selection under 
sustained dietary restriction will favor increased investment in reproduction at 
the cost of survival because "good-times" never come. We assayed fecundity and 
survival of female Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies that had evolved for 50 
generations on three different diets varying in protein content-low (classic 
dietary restriction diet), standard, and high-in a full-factorial design. 
High-diet females evolved overall increased fecundity but showed reduced 
survival on low and standard diets. Low-diet females evolved reduced survival on 
low diet without corresponding increase in reproduction. In general, there was 
little correspondence between the evolution of survival and fecundity across all 
dietary regimes. Our results contradict the hypothesis that resource 
reallocation between fecundity and somatic maintenance underpins life span 
extension under dietary restriction.

Bactrocera minax (Enderlein) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a major citrus pest in 
China, whose artificial rearing technology of the adult is not well documented 
to date. In this study, we tried to determine if supplementing proteins to the 
adult diet could result in the enhancement of some fitness parameters of B. 
minax. Four feeds with varying protein source were provided as F0 (water), F1 
(sucrose), F2 (sucrose + yeast), and F3 (sucrose + peptone). F0 and F1 being the 
control, F2 and F3 were protein food types. The results showed that adults fed 
by F2 and F3 lived longer with 40.1 d and 32.8 d, respectively, had reduced 
death rates (death peaks were delayed for 5.6 d and 4.1 d, respectively), 
increased mating frequencies (8.1 and 5.3 per females, 4.7 and 7.3 per males, 
respectively), and longer mating durations (with 42 d and 34 d). In addition, 
females recorded an increased adult ovary development, more egg load (with 94.8 
and 77.3 brood eggs per ovary) and to greater oviposition rates of 63.2 
eggs/female and 19.3 eggs/female. Based on our results, protein supplements 
enhanced B. minax survival, mating, and fecundity. This study does not only 
provide basic knowledge to implement artificial rearing of B. minax, but also 
deepens our understanding on its physiology that could be used to enhance the 
management of the pest.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of risk 
factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in black adult South 
Africans and to estimate the size of the associated risks.
METHODS: A case-control analysis of 150 black South African patients (aged 18-75 
years) with HCC-who were a subset of patients recruited for the Johannesburg 
Cancer Case Control Study 2000 to 2012-was undertaken. The association between 
this tumour and hepatitis B/C virus infections, and human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) mono- and co-infections was investigated. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, year of diagnosis, marital status, 
place of birth and selected modifiable risk factors were calculated.
RESULTS: HCC was significantly associated with a rural birthplace (p<0.05), 
being male and living in an urban area for 14 years or less. The Odds Ratio (OR) 
for HCC increased significantly with HBV DNA+/HBsAg+ (OR 34.5; CI:16.26-73.13), 
HBV DNA+/HBsAg- (OR 3.76; CI:1.79-7.92), HBV DNA level >2000 IU/ml (OR 8.55; 
CI:3.00-24.54) to ≥200,000 (OR 16.93; CI:8.65-33.13), anti-HCV (OR 8.98; 
CI:3.59-22.46), HBV DNA+/HIV+ co-infection (OR 5.36; CI:2.59-11.11), but not 
with HBV DNA-/HIV+ (OR 0.34; CI:0.14-0.85). We did not find a synergistic 
interaction between HBV and HIV. Modifiable risk factors (alcohol consumption, 
tobacco smoking, number of sexual partners, diabetes and hormonal contraceptive 
use) were nonsignificant.
DISCUSSION: A considerable portion of the HCC burden in Johannesburg and 
surrounding provinces falls on rural migrants to urban areas, most of whom are 
men. The HBV will continue to contribute to HCC incidence in older age-groups 
and in others who missed vaccination. Although we did not find an increased risk 
for HCC in HIV positive individuals this may change as life expectancy increases 
due to greater access to antiretroviral therapies, necessitating the addition of 
hepatitis virus screening to preventive medical care.

Primary localized endobronchial amyloidosis is a rare entity, as pulmonary 
amyloidosis most commonly occurs as a part of systemic AL amyloidosis. It can be 
asymptomatic or can present with nonspecific symptoms such as progressive 
dyspnea, cough, wheezing and rarely respiratory failure. It is frequently 
misdiagnosed as asthma, COPD or pneumonia. Solitary endobronchial amyloidosis 
having a nodular appearance can mimic endobronchial tumor. The diagnosis is 
usually delayed by 8-37 months. The average life expectancy for primary 
tracheobronchial amyloidosis is approximately 9 years, so the early diagnosis of 
this disease is very critical to improve the prognosis of patients. We are 
presenting a case of 65 year old male which was initially diagnosed and treated 
as asthma exacerbation with minimal improvement. Further workup was done with CT 
chest, bronchoscopy and biopsy because of persistent shortness of breath, which 
revealed primary localized solitary endobronchial amyloidosis.

BACKGROUND: Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) is a hereditary cancer predisposing 
syndrome caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the serine/threonine kinase 
11 (STK11) gene and is associated with decreased life expectancy. Many families 
experience a poorer quality of life due to the psychological burden associated 
with the carrier status of their child. Therefore early genetic testing and 
confirmation of the diagnosis is important for patients' psychological status, 
as well as for clinical management, genetic counseling and possible prenatal 
family planning.
METHODS: In this study, peripheral blood genomic DNA samples from a Chinese PJS 
family with a high cancer risk were examined for STK11 mutations using Sanger 
sequencing and MLPA analysis. Furthermore, prenatal PJS testing from 
transabdominal chorionic villi sample was performed in one female member of the 
family. This family was followed up for three years.
RESULTS: In this family, the STK11 exon 1 deletion (c.-1114-?_290 +?del) was 
predicted to affect the kinase domain of the protein and co-segregated with the 
disease phenotype. The same mutation was detected in the fetus and genetic 
sequencing and MLPA of the infant's DNA and the pigmentation on his lips 
confirmed the result of prenatal testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first report on PJS prenatal diagnosis of a PJS family in China.
CONCLUSIONS: An accurate and convenient PJS prenatal testing provides an 
opportunity for affected families to focus on polyp-related symptoms and cancer 
prevention and may be helpful for couples in family planning decision-making.

Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic 
challenges.

Heraklion, Crete, Greece.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent complication in cirrhosis and its 
prevalence increases with disease severity. Several factors are involved in the 
development and progression of PVT. The challenge for the management of PVT is 
the precise evaluation of the bleeding risk as opposed to life-threatening 
extension of thrombosis. Nevertheless, the impact on the progression and outcome 
of liver disease is unclear. A critical evaluation of the available data 
discloses that treating PVT in cirrhotics is safe and effective. However, there 
are open issues, such as which anticoagulant could represent a safer therapeutic 
option, and when and for how long this treatment should be administered to 
cirrhotic patients with PVT.

BACKGROUND: Spontaneous cerebellar hemorrhages (CHs), which frequently require 
surgical intervention, are life-threatening and can be complicated by 
intraventricular hemorrhages (IVHs) and obstructive hydrocephalus. Commonly, 
endoscopic surgery is performed to remove CHs via a suboccipital approach (SA) 
alone. At our institution, when patients exhibited supratentorial IVH-associated 
hydrocephalus, we used a combined frontal and suboccipital approach (CA) to 
evacuate both CHs and supratentorial IVHs. The present study retrospectively 
evaluated the effectiveness and safety of this CA, as no prior studies examining 
this approach currently exist.
METHODS: Twenty-six patients with spontaneous CH were surgically treated at our 
hospital from April 2009 to March 2016. Twenty-two patients who could 
independently perform activities of daily living before the onset underwent 
endoscopic surgery to evacuate the CHs; among these, 13 patients underwent the 
SA alone, while nine underwent the CA. We assessed and compared the patients' 
baseline characteristics, surgical results, and prognosis at 1 month after the 
intervention between the SA and CA groups.
RESULTS: Patients who underwent the CA had significantly poorer consciousness 
before the surgery owing to IVH extension and obstructive hydrocephalus. 
However, the surgical results and prognosis at 1 month were not significantly 
different between the two approaches. The CH-associated IVHs were successfully 
removed with the CA and resulted in shorter external ventricular drainage (EVD) 
placement durations.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic surgery performed via the CA appeared to neutralize the 
deteriorating effects of CH-associated IVHs. Surgical strategies employing the 
CA may have the potential to improve the prognosis of patients with CH.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review broadly discusses the consequences of inadequate 
consumption, by deficit or excess, of selected micronutrients on the quality of 
life and morbidity during aging, specifically considering increases in life 
expectancy and the costs of care in the older persons.
RECENT FINDINGS: A literature review of the periods 2012 to 2018, focusing on 
vitamins A, B12, and D, calcium, iron and folate, was completed as these 
micronutrients are found to significantly affect the aging process. Causation 
and application of these micronutrients to disorders related to aging are 
controversial and mixed. This review highlights research needs and controversial 
points on the role of these micronutrients.
SUMMARY: Micronutrient deficiencies are a common and avoidable contributor to 
decreased quality of life and healthcare costs in the older persons. Further 
research is needed to determine adequate intakes and innovative uses, including 
appropriate thresholds for improved health outcomes for this population.

Systematic and quantitative reviews on the effects of land-based self-exclusion 
are scarce. Therefore, the current review aimed to provide a comprehensive 
summary of (1) the demographic characteristics of land-based self-excluders and 
changes after exclusion, including (2) gambling behavior, (3) gambling problems, 
(4) mental symptoms, and (5) mental health. A systematic database and literature 
search was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Nineteen naturalistic studies 
met the eligibility criteria. The quality of all included records was rated via 
adaption of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results from higher-quality records were 
more heavily weighted. Self-excluders were predominantly men in their early or 
middle forties. Changes after exclusion revealed wide ranges in the rates of 
abstinence (13-81%), rates of gambling reduction (29-92%), and rates of 
exclusion breaches (8-59%). The records consistently demonstrated significant 
changes in pathological gambling from before exclusion (61-95%) to after 
exclusion (13-26%). Up to 73% of self-excluders exhibited symptoms of anxiety, 
depression, and substance use disorders at program enrollment. Several aspects 
of mental health improved after exclusion, e.g., quality of life. Problem and 
pathological gambling are most prevalent in young men, but self-exclusion was 
most prominent in middle-aged men. The magnitude of effects widely differed 
between studies despite overall benefits of self-exclusion, and many individuals 
continued gambling after exclusion. This shortcoming could be minimized using 
improved access controls and the extension of exclusion to other gambling 
segments. High rates of pathological gambling and other mental disorders in 
self-excluders highlight the need for improved early detection and treatment 
accessibility.

It has been proposed that medical organizations adopt neutrality with respect to 
physician-assisted suicide (PAS), given that the practice is legal in some 
jurisdictions and that membership is divided. We review developments in 
end-of-life care and the role of medical organizations with respect to the 
legalization of PAS since the 1990s. We argue that moving from opposition to 
neutrality is not ethically neutral, but a substantive shift from prohibited to 
optional. We argue that medical organizations already oppose many practices that 
are legal in many jurisdictions, and that unanimity among membership has not 
been required for any other clinical or ethical policy positions. Moreover, on 
an issue so central to the meaning of medical professionalism, it seems 
important for organized medicine to take a stand. We subsequently review the 
arguments in favor of PAS (arguments from autonomy and mercy, and against the 
distinction between killing and allowing to die (K/ATD)) and the arguments 
against legalization (the limits of autonomy, effects on the patient-physician 
relationship, the meaning of healing, the validity of the K/ATD distinction, the 
social nature of suicide, the availability of alternatives, the propensity for 
incremental extension, and the meaning of control). We conclude that organized 
medicine should continue its opposition to PAS.

Extension of mammalian health and life span has been achieved using various 
dietary interventions. We previously reported that restricting dietary 
methionine (MET) content extends life span only when growth hormone signaling is 
intact (no life span increase in GH deficiency or GH resistance). To understand 
the metabolic responses of altered dietary MET in the context of accelerated 
aging (high GH), the current study evaluated MET and related pathways in 
short-living GH transgenic (GH Tg) and wild-type mice following 8 weeks of 
restricted (0.16%), low (0.43%), or enriched (1.3%) MET consumption. Liver MET 
metabolic enzymes were suppressed in GH Tg compared to diet-matched wild-type 
mice. MET metabolite levels were differentially affected by GH status and diet. 
SAM:SAH ratios were markedly higher in GH Tg mice. Glutathione levels were lower 
in both genotypes consuming 0.16% MET but reduced in GH Tg mice when compared to 
wild type. Tissue thioredoxin and glutaredoxin were impacted by diet and GH 
status. The responsiveness to the different MET diets is reflected across many 
metabolic pathways indicating the importance of GH signaling in the ability to 
discriminate dietary amino acid levels and alter metabolism and life span.

Haemochromatosis is most commonly due to the autosomal recessive inheritance of 
a C282Y substitution in the HFE protein, whereby both alleles of the 
corresponding gene are affected. The disease is characterised by an 
inappropriate increase in intestinal iron absorption due to reduced expression 
of the iron regulatory protein, hepcidin. Progressive iron deposition in 
parenchymal tissues may ultimately lead to liver and other organ toxicity. The 
characteristic biochemical abnormalities are raised serum ferritin and 
transferrin saturation, which can be used in conjunction with genetic tests and 
emerging magnetic resonance imaging-based techniques to diagnose patients with 
the disorder. Progressive iron overload can manifest clinically as advanced 
fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Enigmatically, the penetrance 
of both raised iron indices and clinically significant disease is incomplete in 
patients with hereditary haemochromatosis. Regardless, advanced clinical 
presentations of the disease have become less common due to increased awareness 
and earlier diagnosis. On the other hand, obesity and alcohol have been 
identified as major risk factors that can compound the risk of liver injury in 
people with hereditary (HFE) haemochromatosis. The prospect of modifying genes 
that may contribute to the clinical expression of the disease is the subject of 
ongoing research. Treatment with phlebotomy remains the first-line therapy, and 
if instigated early leads to a normal life expectancy. A healthy, well-balanced 
diet is recommended to be incorporated as part of the ongoing management of the 
disease.

While primary cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF human bronchial epithelial basal 
cells (HBECs) accurately represent in vivo phenotypes, one barrier to their 
wider use has been a limited ability to clone and expand cells in sufficient 
numbers to produce rare genotypes using genome-editing tools. Recently, 
conditional reprogramming of cells (CRC) with a Rho-associated protein kinase 
(ROCK) inhibitor and culture on an irradiated fibroblast feeder layer resulted 
in extension of the life span of HBECs, but differentiation capacity and CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function decreased as a function of 
passage. This report details modifications to the standard HBEC CRC protocol 
(Mod CRC), including the use of bronchial epithelial cell growth medium, instead 
of F medium, and 2% O2, instead of 21% O2, that extend HBEC life span while 
preserving multipotent differentiation capacity and CFTR function. Critically, 
Mod CRC conditions support clonal growth of primary HBECs from a single cell, 
and the resulting clonal HBEC population maintains multipotent differentiation 
capacity, including CFTR function, permitting gene editing of these cells. As a 
proof-of-concept, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and cloning were used to introduce 
insertions/deletions in CFTR exon 11. Mod CRC conditions overcome many barriers 
to the expanded use of HBECs for basic research and drug screens. Importantly, 
Mod CRC conditions support the creation of isogenic cell lines in which CFTR is 
mutant or wild-type in the same genetic background with no history of CF to 
enable determination of the primary defects of mutant CFTR.

OBJECTIVE: In Japan, the National Immunization Program (NIP) includes PPV23 as 
the primary vaccination for adults and catch-up cohorts. The Japanese 
Association for Infectious Diseases recommends revaccination for older adults 
who received primary vaccination ≥5 years earlier. The cost-effectiveness of 
adding revaccination and/or continuing catch-up vaccination in the NIP was 
evaluated from the public payer perspective in Japan.
METHODS: The Markov model included five health states: no pneumococcal disease, 
invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia 
(NBPP), post-meningitis sequelae, and death. Cohorts of adults aged 65-95 were 
followed until age 100 or death: 2014 cohort (aged 65-95, vaccinated: 2014); 
2019 cohort (aged 65: 2019); and 2019 catch-up cohort (aged 70-100: 2019, 
unvaccinated: 2014). Strategies included: (1) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts; 
(2) vaccinate 2014 and 2019 cohorts and revaccinate both; (3) strategy 1 and 
vaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort; (4) strategy 2 and vaccinate 2019 catch-up 
cohort; and (5) strategy 4 and revaccinate 2019 catch-up cohort. Parameters were 
retrieved from global and Japanese sources, costs and QALYs discounted at 2%, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) estimated.
RESULTS: Strategy 1 had the highest number of IPD and NBPP cases, and strategy 5 
the lowest. Strategies 3-5 dominated strategy 1 and strategy 2 was 
cost-effective compared to strategy 1 (ICER: ¥1,622,153 per QALY gained). At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of ¥5 million per QALY gained, strategy 2 was 
cost-effective and strategies 3-5 were cost-saving compared to strategy 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Strategies including revaccination, catch-up, or both were 
cost-effective or cost-saving in comparison to no revaccination and no catch-up. 
Results can inform future vaccine policies and programs in Japan.

Indubitably, the challenges facing health-care social workers are becoming 
increasingly complex. Whilst these problematic professional circumstances 
compound the need for self-compassion among health-care social workers, few 
studies, if any, have explicitly examined self-compassion among this 
practitioner group. This cross-sectional study explored self-compassion among a 
sample of practitioners (N = 138) in one southeastern state. Results indicate 
that health-care social workers in this sample engage in self-compassion only 
moderately. Further, occupational and demographic/life characteristics (e.g., 
age, years practicing social work, average hours worked per week, health status, 
and relationship status, among others) are able to predict self-compassion 
scores. After a terse review of relevant literature, this paper will explicate 
findings from this study, discuss relevant points derived from said findings, 
and identify salient implication for health-care social work praxis.

BACKGROUND: While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of 
elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as 
chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of 
International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general 
population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic 
medallists (OMs).
METHODS: Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 
countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox 
proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at 
risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The 
RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and 
sex to the life table of the country the individual represented.
RESULTS: The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement 
were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 
years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 
([95% CI]: 47.7-58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall 
weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared 
to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29-0.88]) and 
Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34-0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS 
analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over 
the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in 
the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08-1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 
1.09 [1.07-1.11]) at 30 years.
CONCLUSION: Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have 
a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports.

Liver transplantation (LTX) is an established therapy for pediatric patients 
with liver failure. In recent decades, survival rates have risen continuously. 
With increased life expectancy, there has been greater attention to children's 
and adolescents' quality of life following transplantation. This article 
provides an overview of the tasks of pediatric transplant psychology. We 
summarize the reviewed literature of research on health-related quality of life 
in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Furthermore, we present studies on 
fatigue, mental health, cognitive development and family strain. In adolescents 
and young adults, the risk of non-adherence is particularly high. Therefore, 
adherence and transition, i. e. transfer from pediatric to adult-centered 
transplant care, are discussed separately. Subsequently, studies on long-term 
survival after LTX are summarized. In conclusion, recommendations for clinical 
practice are given.

Publisher: Die Lebertransplantation (LTX) ist ein etabliertes Therapieverfahren 
für pädiatrische Patienten mit Leberversagen. Dabei sind die Überlebensraten in 
den letzten Jahrzehnten kontinuierlich gestiegen. Mit der Anzahl gewonnener 
Lebensjahre rückt die Frage nach deren Qualität in den Vordergrund. Dieser 
Artikel gibt einen Überblick über die Aufgabenfelder der pädiatrischen 
Transplantationspsychologie. Es werden Forschungsergebnisse zur 
gesundheitsbezogenen Lebensqualität von lebertransplantierten Kindern und 
Jugendlichen sowie zu Fatigue, zur psychischen Gesundheit, zur kognitiven 
Entwicklung und zu familiären Belastungen vorgestellt. Im Jugend- und jungem 
Erwachsenenalter ist das Risiko für Non-Adhärenz besonders hoch. Daher werden 
Adhärenz und Transition, das heißt der Wechsel in die Erwachsenenmedizin, 
gesondert diskutiert sowie Studien zum Langzeitüberleben nach LTX vorgestellt. 
Empfehlungen für die klinische Praxis bilden den Abschluss.

BACKGROUND: Achieving optimal control is the primary objective of asthma 
management. However, despite the existence of effective treatments, many 
patients experience periods of sub-optimal asthma control. The objective of this 
study was to quantify and project the future economic and health burden of 
sub-optimal asthma control in Canada.
METHODS: A probabilistic time-in-state model of asthma was created with inputs 
from published studies on the prevalence of asthma, levels of asthma control, 
and the impact of asthma control on costs and quality of life. In the primary 
analysis, we modeled the 20-year total direct costs (in 2014 Canadian dollars) 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from 2014 to 2033 in Canada. In the 
secondary analysis, we also incorporated indirect costs.
RESULTS: The undiscounted projected 20-year direct costs and QALYs lost 
attributable to sub-optimal asthma control were $24.40 billion and 1.82 million, 
respectively, from 2014 to 2033. The corresponding discounted values (at 3%) 
were $18.54 billion and 1.38 million. When indirect costs were considered, the 
total undiscounted and discounted costs of sub-optimal control were projected to 
be $280.49 billion, and $213.10 billion, respectively. A 10% reduction in 
prevalence of sub-optimal control in asthma was associated with 18% reduction in 
the economic and health burden of asthma over this time period.
DISCUSSION: Sub-optimal asthma control is associated with a substantial economic 
and health burden. Given that with evidence-based disease management asthma can 
be controlled in the majority of patients, strategies towards improving asthma 
management can be associated with a significant return on investment.

INTRODUCTION: Tumor vaccines use various strategies to generate immune 
responses, commonly targeting generic tumor-associated antigens. The tumor 
lysate, particle-loaded, dendritic cell (TLPLDC) vaccine is produced from DC 
loaded with autologous tumor antigens, creating a patient-specific vaccine. 
Here, we describe initial phase I/IIa trial results.
METHODS: This trial includes patients with any stage solid tumors, ECOG ≤1, and 
>4 months life-expectancy. A personalized vaccine is created using 1 mg of tumor 
and 120 ml blood (to isolate DC). Primary vaccination series (PVS) is four 
monthly inoculations. Patients are followed per standard of care (SOC). 
Endpoints include safety and tumor response (RECIST v1.1).
RESULTS: 44 patients were enrolled and vaccinated consisting of 31 late stage 
patients with residual/measurable disease, and 13 disease-free patients after 
SOC therapies. While 4 patients progressed before completing the PVS, 12/31 
(39%) demonstrated clinical benefit (2 complete responses, 4 partial responses, 
6 stable disease). In the adjuvant setting, 46% of late stage patients remain 
disease free at a median of 22.5 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The TLPLDC vaccine is scalable, generates a personalized DC 
vaccine, and requires little autologous tumor tissue and few DC. The vaccine is 
safe, with primarily grade 0-2 toxicities, and nearly 40% clinical benefit rate 
in varied tumors, warranting further study.
