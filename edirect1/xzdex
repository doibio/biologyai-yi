Dementias were ranked fourth among the leading causes of death in people aged 
≥70 years in 2000, rising to second place in 2016. In 2016, it also represented 
the second and third leading causes of disability among older women and men, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Population growth and aging have resulted in an increased burden of 
AD and other dementias in Brazil. Preventive and early diagnostic measures are 
essential to mitigate the burden associated with these diseases.

BACKGROUND: The improved life expectancy observed in patients living with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has made age-related cardiovascular 
complications, including arrhythmias, a growing health concern.
HYPOTHESIS: We describe the temporal trends in frequency of various arrhythmias 
and assess impact of arrhythmias on hospitalized HIV patients using the 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS).
METHODS: Data on HIV-related hospitalizations from 2005 to 2014 were obtained 
from the NIS database using International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
Revision (ICD-9) codes. Data was further subclassified into hospitalizations 
with associated arrhythmias and those without. Baseline demographics and 
comorbidities were determined. Outcomes including in-hospital mortality, cost of 
care, and length of stay were extracted. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) 
was utilized for analysis. A multivariable analysis was performed to identify 
predictors of arrhythmias among hospitalized HIV patients.
RESULTS: Among 2 370 751 HIV-related hospitalizations identified, the overall 
frequency of any arrhythmia was 3.01%. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most 
frequent arrhythmia (2110 per 100 000). The overall frequency of arrhythmias 
increased over time by 108%, primarily due to a 132% increase in AF. Arrhythmias 
are more frequent among older males, lowest income quartile, and nonelective 
admissions. Patients with arrhythmias had a higher in-hospital mortality rate 
(9.6%). In-hospital mortality among patients with arrhythmias decreased over 
time by 43.8%. The cost of care and length of stay associated with 
arrhythmia-related hospitalizations were mostly unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: Arrhythmias are associated with significant morbidity and mortality 
in hospitalized HIV patients. AF is the most frequent arrhythmia in hospitalized 
HIV patients.

OVERVIEW: A novel highly bioavailable curcumin-galactomannan (CGM) formulation 
was shown to have improved blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability of free 
curcuminoids in animal models; however, this has not been established in humans. 
The present study was conducted to determine the functional effects of CGM on 
brain waves in healthy individuals, owing to its BBB permeability.
METHODS: A total of 18 healthy volunteers aged 35-65 were randomly assigned to 
consume 500 mg CGM, Unformulated curcumin (UC) or Placebo capsules twice daily 
for 30 days. Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, audio-visual reaction time 
tests and a working memory test were conducted at baseline and after 30 days.
RESULTS: Supplementation of CGM resulted in a significant increase in α- and 
β-waves (p < 0.05) as well as a significant reduction in α/β ratio in comparison 
with unformulated curcumin and placebo groups. Furthermore, the CGM showed 
significant reduction in the audio-reaction time (29.8 %; p < 0.05) in 
comparison with placebo and 24.6% (p < 0.05) with unformulated curcumin. The 
choice-based visual-reaction time was also significantly decreased (36%) in CGM 
as compared to unformulated curcumin and placebo which produced 15.36% and 5.2% 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The observed increase in α and β waves and reduction in α/β ratio in 
the CGM group suggest that CGM can influence the brain waves in healthy subjects 
in a manner consistent with penetration of the blood-brain-barrier. The EEG 
results correlated with improved audio-visual and working memory tests which 
further support the role of CGM on memory improvements and fatigue reduction.

72. Conservative Management of Chronic Kidney Disease in Adult Patients: A Review
of  Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].

Subramonian A, Frey N.

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2020 Jul 10.
CADTH Rapid Response Reports.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as impaired kidney function and 
proteinuria present over at least 3 months and is often present along with 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
of <60mL/min/1.73m2 is considered as a measure of impaired kidney function, 
which along with presence of albuminuria, abnormal histological findings (as 
detected through kidney tissue biopsy) or urine sediment abnormalities are used 
to diagnose CKD. Based on eGFR values, CKD is classified into 5 stages. Among 
them CKD stage 4 (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2) indicates severe loss of kidney 
function and CKD stage 5 (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m2) indicates kidney failure also 
called end stage renal disease (ESRD)., Earlier stages (stages 1, 2 and 3) can 
be asymptomatic and may be reversible with medical management. CKD is a major 
public health concern globally and in Canada affecting 12.5% or roughly 3 
million Canadians during the period 2007-2009. Increasing prevalence of CKD has 
been attributed to a growing elderly population and increasing rates of 
diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors. When the kidney 
fails, treatment options are contained to a) Renal replacement therapy by way of 
hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) or renal transplantation or b) 
conservative management (CM). CKD management is a significant burden on the 
healthcare system and is associated with high cost. The costs associated with 
treating ESRD alone accounts for around 1.1% of annual health spending in 
Canada. Annual cost per year per patient on HD or PD is just under $10,000 CAD. 
Dialysis is also associated with several other disadvantages such as need for 
vascular access, risk of complications, access to resources (for e.g., 
equipment, center space), interruptions to daily life and decline of functional 
status, all of which could be a higher burden for elderly patients with other 
major comorbidities., CM has been proposed as a comprehensive non-dialysis care 
to prolong kidney function, management of symptoms, acidosis, anemia, bone and 
mineral metabolism, blood pressure, and dietary support., It involves 
individualizing care through shared decision making to offer psychological, 
social and spiritual support for the patients. Although dialysis care has been 
shown to prolong life expectancy, factors such as quality of life, hospital free 
survival and general wellbeing of the patients are of paramount importance and 
need to be actively managed. A shared decision making process will enable the 
patient, caregiver and the healthcare provider to ensure that patient 
preferences, goals and medical concerns have been sufficiently addressed while 
deciding conservative or dialysis care is the best option for the patient.– 
Economic considerations also play an important role from this decision making 
process from a healthcare provider perspective. The purpose of this report is to 
summarize the evidence regarding clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness 
of CM in patients with late or end stage CKD (CKD4/5 ESRD).

OBJECTIVE: To construct and validate a clinically accurate and 
histology-specific nomogram to predict overall survival (OS) among liposarcoma 
(LPS) patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively screened eligible patients with LPS diagnosed 
between 2004 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
database. We screened independent predictors for the nomogram using univariate 
and multivariate analyses. We then evaluated the prognostic accuracy of the 
nomogram by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and Harrell's 
concordance index. The prognostic performances of the nomogram and the American 
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition staging system were compared 
using integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification 
improvement (NRI), and decision curve analyses (DCA).
RESULTS: A novel nomogram was developed using independent prognostic variables, 
which exhibited excellent predictive performances for 3- and 5-year OS according 
to ROC curves. The C-index proved that the proposed nomogram had better 
prognostic accuracy for LPS than the traditional AJCC system, while the NRI, 
IDI, and DCA of the nomogram indicated better clinical net benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed nomogram can predict 3- and 5-year OS of LPS patients 
with reliable accuracy and may thus help clinicians to develop appropriate 
clinical therapies and counseling strategies to prolong the life expectancy of 
these patients.

BAY 94-9027 (damoctocog alfa pegol, Jivi) is an extended-half-life recombinant 
factor VIII (rFVIII) shown to be well-tolerated and efficacious in bleeding 
prevention in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. During the 
PROTECT VIII study, prophylaxis patients received BAY 94-9027 at intervals 
determined based on their bleeding phenotype, observed during a 10-week run-in 
treatment period with twice-weekly dosing. Those with ≤ 1 spontaneous joint or 
muscle bleed were randomized to either 45 to 60 IU/kg every 5 days or 60 IU/kg 
every 7 days; patients could increase dosing frequency to every 5 days or twice 
weekly in the case of bleeds. Those enrolled after the randomization arms were 
full, and those with ≥ 2 bleeds in the run-in period, received 30 to 40 IU/kg 
twice weekly. Patients completing the main study could receive open-label BAY 
94-9027 in the extension phase. Dosing regimen, total, and joint annualized 
bleeding rates were analyzed over three periods: prestudy, main study, and 
extension. A total of 80 patients who were on prophylaxis treatment prior to and 
during the study and had prior bleed data available were evaluated in this post 
hoc analysis of PROTECT VIII. Most patients (> 80%) required fewer infusions 
with BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis versus their previous standard-half-life (SHL) 
rFVIII product. Lower bleeding and joint bleeding rates were observed over time 
from the prestudy to the extension study period in all treatment regimens. 
Compared with SHL FVIII, BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis allows patients to reduce 
infusion frequency with maintained or improved protection from bleeds.

INTRODUCTION: The efficacy of resistance training for hip replacement remains 
controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the 
influence of resistance training on functional recovery for hip replacement.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library 
databases through April 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing 
the effect of resistance training on hip replacement.
RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 251 patients are included in the meta-analysis. 
Overall, compared with the control group for post-hip replacement patients, 
resistance training can significantly improve hip-related quality of life 
(standard mean difference [SMD] = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.68; p = 0.04), 
symptoms (SMD = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.74; p = 0.02), sports and recreation 
(SMD = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.75; p = 0.01), and reduce pain scores 
(SMD = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.74; p = 0.02), but has no remarkable impact on 
activities of daily living function (SMD = 0.48; 95% CI = 0 to 0.96; p = 0.05), 
sit to stand (SMD = 0.17; 95% CI = - 0.25 to 0.59; p = 0.44), stair climb 
performance (SMD = 0.06; 95% CI = - 0.36 to 0.48; p = 0.77), and leg extension 
power (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI = - 0.17 to 1.01; p = 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training is associated with significantly improved 
hip-related quality of life, symptoms, and sports and recreation, and decreased 
pain scores in post-hip replacement patients.

Publisher: INTRODUCTION: Die Effektivität von Widerstandstraining nach 
Hüftgelenkersatzoperationen ist kontrovers. Wir führten eine systematische 
Überprüfung und eine Metaanalyse durch, um die Auswirkung von 
Widerstandstraining auf die funktionelle Widerherstellung nach einer 
Hüftgelenkersatzoperation zu bewerten.
METHODEN: Die Datenbanken PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, EBSCO, und Cochrane 
Library wurden im April 2018 nach randomisierten kontrollieren Studien (RCTs) 
zur Bewertung der Auswirkung von Widerstandstraining auf die Hüftfunktionalität 
nach einer Hüftgelenkersatzoperation durchsucht.
ERGEBNISSE: Fünf RCTs mit ingesamt 251 Patienten wurden in die Metaanalyse 
aufgenommen. Bei einem Vergleich mit einer Kontrollgruppe von Patienten nach 
Hüftgelenksoperationen, stellte sich heraus, dass Widerstandstraining insgesamt 
zu einer signifikanten Verbesserung der hüftbezogenen Lebensqualität 
(Standard-Mittelwertdifferenz [SMD] = 0,35; 95%-KI 0,02 – 0,68; p = 0,04) und 
der Symptome (SMD = 0,41; 95%-KI 0,08 – 0,74; p = 0,02) sowie beim Sport und in 
der Freizeit (SMD = 0,41; 95%-KI 0,08 – 0,75; p = 0.01) führt und die 
Schmerz-Scores verringert (SMD = 0,41; 95%-KI 0,08 – 0,74; p = 0,02). 
Widerstandstraining hatte aber keine starke Auswirkungen auf die Funktion bei 
Alltagsaktivitäten (SMD = 0,48; 95%-KI 0 – 0,96; p = 0,05), den Sitz-Stand-Test 
(SMD = 0,17; 95%-KI − 0,25 – 0,59; p = 0,44), die Treppensteigleistung 
(SMD = 0,06; 95%-KI = − 0,36 – 0,48; p = 0,77) und die Beinstreckkraft 
(SMD = 0,42; 95%.KI – 0,17 – 1.01; p = 0,17).
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Widerstandstraining führt zu einer signifikanten Verbesserung 
der hüftbezogenen Lebensqualität und der Symptome sowie beim Sport und in der 
Freizeit und reduziert die Schmerz-Scores bei Patienten nach 
Hüftgelenksersatzoperationen.

BACKGROUND: The safety profile of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) for multiple sclerosis 
(MS) is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature for adverse events (AE) 
associated with DMF for MS.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and 
clinicaltrials.gov for articles published from database inception to May/2019. 
Studies (observational and randomized controlled trials (RCTs)) reporting AEs, 
serious AEs (SAE), or discontinuation due to AEs were included. We summarized 
the proportion of DMF-exposed patients affected and calculated the risk ratios 
(RR) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for the DMF relative to placebo-exposed participants. 
RCT findings were pooled via meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Twenty-one observational studies, 4 RCTs, 1 RCT extension study, and 2 
open-label studies were included, totalling 12,380 MS patients on DMF followed 
for an average of 19.8 months. Compared to placebo, DMF-exposed patients had a 
higher risk of grade III/IV lymphopenia (NNTH = 28.8;95%CI:20.2-50.5), pruritus 
(NNTH = 22.1;95%CI:14.0-52.3), flushing (NNTH = 3.7;95%CI:3.3-4.1), 
gastrointestinal related events (NNTH = 5.7;95%CI:3.5-15.7), nausea 
(NNTH = 23.4;95%CI:14.9-54.7), diarrhea (NNTH = 21.2;95%CI:13.6-47.6), and 
abdominal pain (NNTH = 19.2;95%CI:12.9-37.9). Patients discontinued DMF because 
of GI symptoms (498/5619;8.9%), lymphopenia (163/4003;4.1%), and flushing 
(173/4779;3.6%). From pooled analyses of 4 RCTs, AE risks were higher in the DMF 
versus placebo groups (RR = 1.37;95%CI:1.27-1.48), but SAEs were similar 
(RR = 1.01;95%CI:0.77-1.33).
CONCLUSION: Over the short-term, DMF was associated with a higher risk of AEs. 
The NNTH included 4 for flushing, 6 for gastrointestinal complaints, and 29 for 
severe or life-threatening (grade III/IV) lymphopenia. The longer-term safety of 
DMF, including consequences of lymphopenia remain unknown.

BACKGROUND: Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, was first described in 
the 1960s and is now defined as the second most common trisomy. While this 
genetic disease has been attributed to nondisjunction during meiosis, the exact 
mechanism remains unknown. Trisomy 18 is associated with a significantly 
increased mortality rate of about 5-10% of patients surviving until 1 year of 
age. We present a case of a 26-year-old female diagnosed with trisomy 18, well 
outliving her life expectancy, maintaining a stable state of health.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old female with non-mosaic Edwards syndrome 
presented to the clinic for follow up after recent hospitalization for 
aspiration pneumonia. The definitive diagnosis of trisomy 18 was made prenatally 
utilizing chromosomal analysis and G-banding and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) on cells obtained via amniocentesis. Her past medical 
history is characterized by severe growth and intellectual limitations; 
recurrent history of infections, especially respiratory system infections; and a 
ventricular septal defect (VSD) that was never surgically repaired. She remains 
in good, stable health and is under close follow-up and monitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that Edwards syndrome carries a significantly high 
mortality rate due to several comorbidities, recent literature including this 
case report has identified patients surviving into adulthood. Advancements in 
early detection and parent education have likely allowed for these findings. We 
aim to present a case of an adult with trisomy 18, living in stable condition, 
with an importance on medical follow-up.

epidemiological transition on related risk factors among the Chinese population 
from 1990 to 2017. Methods: Based on open access data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2017 Study, we used years of life lost (YLD), years lived with 
disability (YLL), and disability-adjusted of life years (DALY) to describe the 
changes of IHD burden stratified by different sex and age groups from 1990 to 
2017. We applied population-attributable faction (PAF) to analyze the burden 
attributable to risk factors and epidemiological transition. Results: In 2017, 
rates on YLD, YLL, and DALY for IHD were 74.2/100 000, 2 459.6/100 000, and 2 
523.1/100 000, respectively. DALY rate and YLL rate for IHD in males were 
invariably higher than those in females except for YLD rate in females. 24 
modifiable risk factors were causally associated with IHD. The top five risk 
factors that influencing DALYs, PAF, and DALY rate in 2017 appeared as: high 
blood pressure (16.429 million person years, 54.6%, 1 163.1/100 000), high LDL 
cholesterol (13 941 million person years, 46.3%, 987.0/100 000), diet high in 
sodium (10.900 million person years, 36.2%, 771.1/100 000), smoking (8.647 
million person years, 28.7%, 612.2/100 000), and low-nut diet (7.452 million 
person years, 24.8%, 527.6/100 000). DALY rate for IHD showed an increase of 
90.9%, from 1 116.4/100 000 in 1990 to 2 131.0/100 000 in 2017. Compared with 
1990, the YLD rate experienced an evident increase in those aged 15-49 and over 
70, in 2017. Annual average growth rate of YLD rate was higher in the ≥70 age 
group, between 2007 and 2017 (0.4%) than that between 1990 and 2007 (0.2%). The 
annual average increasing rates of both YLL and DALY were much lower from 2007 
to 2017 (0.6%, 0.6%) than those from 1990 to 2007 (1.3%, 1.2%). From 1990 to 
2017, DALYs attributed to meaty food (929.7%), beverages with high sugar content 
(822.7%), and high body-mass index (327.3%) experienced the highest increase. 
The largest increase in PAF occurred for beverages with high sugar content 
(400.0%). DALY rates increased for the 8 risk factors whereas decreased on the 7 
risk factors, in consecutive rankings between 2007 and 2017. Conclusions: 
Despite the fact that burden on IHD-caused premature death had been reducing, 
related disabilities remain challenging with IHD the leading cause of burden, 
particularly in the ≥70 year-olds. Higher IHD burden from premature death was 
seen in males but disability appeared higher in females. It is significantly 
important to strengthen programs on prevention and control for hypertension 
including reducing modifiable risk factors such as smoking, unreasonable diet 
habits.

Publisher: 目的： 探讨1990-2017年中国人群缺血性心脏病（IHD）疾病负担及其危险因素的变化趋势。 方法： 
基于2017年全球疾病负担（GBD）中国研究开放数据，利用伤残损失寿命年（YLD）、早死损失寿命年（YLL）、伤残调整寿命年（DALY）等指标对1990-2017年中国不同性别和年龄人群IHD疾病负担变化趋势进行描述，并结合人群归因分值（PAF）分析IHD危险因素的变化情况。 
结果： 2017年，IHD的YLD率、YLL率、DALY率分别为74.2/10万、2 057.2/10万、2 
131.0/10万。YLD率为女性高于男性，YLL率和DALY率则为男性高于女性。与IHD有关的24种可改变危险因素中，导致DALYs、PAF、DALY率排名前5位的危险因素均为高血压（1 
642.9万人年、54.6%、1 163.1/10万）、高LDL-C（1 394.1万人年、46.3%、987.0/10万）、钠摄入过多（1 
090.0万人年、36.2%、771.1/10万）、吸烟（864.7万人年、28.7%、612.2/10万）、坚果摄入不足（745.2万人年、24.8%、527.6/10万）。IHD 
DALY率由1990年1 116.4/10万增至2017年2 
131.0/10万，增长率为90.9%。与1990年相比，2017年15~49岁和≥70岁人群IHD的YLD率增加，且≥70岁人群YLD率的2007-2017年年均增长率（0.4%）高于1990-2007年年均增长率（0.2%）。但YLL率和DALY率的2007-2017年年均增长率（0.6%、0.6%）低于1990-2007年年均增长率（1.3%、1.2%）。与1990年相比，2017年归因于加工肉摄入过多（929.7%）、高糖饮料摄入过多（822.7%）、高BMI（327.3%）的DALYs增幅较大；PAF值增幅最大的为高糖饮料摄入过多（400.0%）。2007-2017年，有8种IHD危险因素的DALY率顺位上升，7种危险因素的DALY率顺位下降。 
结论： 
IHD所致伤残负担增大，尽管其所致的过早死亡得到了有效控制，但仍为疾病负担的主要来源，≥70岁人群中表现尤为明显。IHD对男性患者的影响主要为早死所致疾病负担，对女性主要为失能所致负担。加强对高血压的预防和控制、减少吸烟和改善不合理膳食习惯等行为危险因素是防控IHD的优先措施。.

BACKGROUND: Precise predictions of incidence and mortality rates due to breast 
cancer (BC) are required for planning of public health programs as well as for 
clinical services. A number of approaches has been established for prediction of 
mortality using stochastic models. The performance of these models intensely 
depends on different patterns shown by mortality data in different countries.
METHODS: The BC mortality data is retrieved from the Global burden of disease 
(GBD) study 2017 database. This study include BC mortality rates from 1990 to 
2017, with ages 20 to 80+ years old women, for different Asian countries. Our 
study extend the current literature on Asian BC mortality data, on both the 
number of considered stochastic mortality models and their rigorous evaluation 
using multivariate Diebold-Marino test and by range of graphical analysis for 
multiple countries.
RESULTS: Study findings reveal that stochastic smoothed mortality models based 
on functional data analysis generally outperform on quadratic structure of BC 
mortality rates than the other lee-carter models, both in term of goodness of 
fit and on forecast accuracy. Besides, smoothed lee carter (SLC) model 
outperform the functional demographic model (FDM) in case of symmetric structure 
of BC mortality rates, and provides almost comparable results to FDM in within 
and outside data forecast accuracy for heterogeneous set of BC mortality rates.
CONCLUSION: Considering the SLC model in comparison to the other can be obliging 
to forecast BC mortality and life expectancy at birth, since it provides even 
better results in some cases. In the current situation, we can assume that there 
is no single model, which can truly outperform all the others on every 
population. Therefore, we also suggest generating BC mortality forecasts using 
multiple models rather than relying upon any single model.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to identify the age trajectories of disability in 
instrumental activities of daily life (IADLs) over 11 years and their 
correlates, and to estimate disability-free life expectancy for identified 
trajectory groups in middle-aged and older adults.
METHODS: We included 3118 participants aged 50 and over without IADL limitations 
at baseline from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study in Aging, followed across 
1996-2007. We used group-based trajectory models to identify age trajectories of 
IADL disability, and multiple logistic regressions to examine their correlates. 
Sullivan method was used to compute IADL disability-free life expectancy for 
trajectory groups at different ages.
RESULTS: We identified two trajectories groups: 67.7% of participants classified 
as the late-onset group and 32.3% as the early-onset group. Female (adjusted 
odds ratio [aOR]: 1.93, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.54, 2.41), not being 
employed (aOR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1,08, 1,56), poor/fair self-rated health (aOR: 
1.31, 95% CI:1.09, 1.58), hypertension (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.63), diabetes 
mellitus (aOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.72, 3.07), arthritis (aOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.11, 
1.81), stroke (aOR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.70), and one-point increase in a 
10-item depression scale (aOR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.06) were associated with 
early-onset of disability, whereas higher education (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42, 
0.81), regular exercise (aOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.93), and participating 
voluntary or club activities (aOR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93) related to the 
late-onset. IADL disability-free life expectancies at 65 years old in the 
late-onset group were 15.6 years for women and 14.4 for men, respectively, 
comprising 56.6 and 64.2% of their remaining life, whereas those of the 
early-onset group were 4.8 and 4.6 years for women and men respectively, 
comprising 22.5 and 27.2% of remaining life.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset of IADLs disability may correlate to chronic 
conditions, and engagement in employment, exercise, and social participation 
were associated with a reduced risk of early disability in IADLs.

BACKGROUND: This study estimated the lifetime cost-effectiveness and equity 
impacts associated with two lifestyle interventions in the Dutch primary school 
setting (targeting 4-12 year olds).
METHODS: The Healthy Primary School of the Future (HPSF; a healthy school lunch 
and structured physical activity) and the Physical Activity School (PAS; 
structured physical activity) were compared to the regular Dutch curriculum 
(N = 1676). An adolescence model, calculating weight development, and the RIVM 
Chronic Disease Model, calculating overweight-related chronic diseases, were 
linked to estimate the lifetime impact on chronic diseases, quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs), healthcare, and productivity costs. Cost-effectiveness was 
expressed as the additional costs/QALY gained and we used €20,000 as threshold. 
Scenario analyses accounted for alternative effect maintenance scenarios and 
equity analyses examined cost-effectiveness in different socioeconomic status 
(SES) groups.
RESULTS: HPSF resulted in a lifetime costs of €773 (societal perspective) and a 
lifetime QALY gain of 0.039 per child versus control schools. HPSF led to lower 
costs and more QALYs as compared to PAS. From a societal perspective, HPSF had a 
cost/QALY gained of €19,734 versus control schools, 50% probability of being 
cost-effective, and beneficial equity impact (0.02 QALYs gained/child for low 
versus high SES). The cost-effectiveness threshold was surpassed when 
intervention effects decayed over time.
CONCLUSIONS: HPSF may be a cost-effective and equitable strategy for combatting 
the lifetime burden of unhealthy lifestyles. The win-win situation will, 
however, only be realised if the intervention effect is sustained into adulthood 
for all SES groups.

BACKGROUND: A considerable portion of the elderly population are increasingly 
afflicted by degenerative spinal deformity (DSD), which seriously affects 
patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HRQoL index is used across many 
studies to show correlations between radio-graphical alignment, disability, and 
pain in patients with DSD. However, imaged structural deformity represents only 
one aspect for consideration, namely, the disability effect of DSD. We assessed 
the isokinetic strength of trunk muscle in patients with degenerative spinal 
deformity (DSD), and investigated its relationship with HRQoL.
METHODS: In total, 38 patients with DSD (DSD group) and 32 healthy individuals 
(control group) were recruited. Both groups were homogeneous for age, weight, 
height and body mass index (BMI). Assessments were performed using the 
isokinetic dynamometer IsoMed-2000; trunk extensor, flexor strength and 
flexion/extension (F/E) ratios were explored concentrically at speeds of 30°, 
60° and 120° per second. The grip strength of both hands was measured using a 
hand-held dynamometer. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, the Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI), a Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ), and a 
36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) evaluated patient HRQoL. Correlations 
between trunk strength and HRQoL were analyzed.
RESULTS: When compared with the control group, the DSD group showed lower trunk 
extensor strength at three velocity movements, and higher F/E ratios at 60° and 
120°/s (p < 0.05). Both groups exhibited similar trunk flexor strength and grip 
strength (p > 0.05). In DSD group, trunk extensor strength at 60°/s was 
negatively associated with ODI and RDQ (p < 0.05). A negative relationship 
between trunk flexor strength at 120°/s and ODI was also recorded (p < 0.05). In 
addition, trunk extensor strength at 60°/s and trunk flexor strength at 120°/s 
were positively correlated with physical functioning and role-physical scores 
according to the SF-36 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified isolated trunk extensor myopathy in DSD, which causes 
an imbalance in trunk muscle strength. Isokinetic trunk extensor strength at 
60°/s and trunk flexor strength at 120°/s can predict disability, and decrease 
physical HRQoL in DSD patients.

Aberrant metabolism is the root cause of several serious health issues, creating 
a huge burden to health and leading to diminished life expectancy. A 
dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn 
trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the 
immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and 
harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called 
metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a 
synergic interaction between the host and the exposome-a combination of 
environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors 
throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic 
inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as 
diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, 
cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. 
Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on 
individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are 
needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. 
Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle 
modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an 
individual's biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision 
medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication 
through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, 
function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance 
computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater 
accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. 
AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to 
specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we 
discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, 
data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing 
lifestyle-related diseases.

Economic evaluations help decision-makers faced with tough decisions on how to 
allocate resources. Systematic reviews of economic evaluations are useful as 
they allow readers to assess whether interventions have been demonstrated to be 
cost effective, the uncertainty in the evidence base, and key limitations or 
gaps in the evidence base. The synthesis of systematic reviews of economic 
evaluations commonly takes a narrative approach whereas a meta-analysis is 
common step for reviews of clinical evidence (e.g. effectiveness or adverse 
event outcomes). As they are common objectives in other reviews, readers may 
query why a synthesis has not been attempted for economic outcomes. However, a 
meta-analysis of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, costs, or health 
benefits (including quality-adjusted life years) is fraught with issues largely 
due to heterogeneity across study designs and methods and further practical 
challenges. Therefore, meta-analysis is rarely feasible or robust. This 
commentary outlines these issues, supported by examples from the literature, to 
support researchers and reviewers considering systematic review of economic 
evidence.

Organelle transport requires dynamic cytoskeleton remodeling, but whether 
cytoskeletal dynamics are, in turn, regulated by organelles remains elusive. 
Here, we demonstrate that late endosomes, a type of prelysosomal organelles, 
facilitate actin-cytoskeleton remodeling via cytosolic translocation of immature 
protease cathepsin D (cathD) during microglia migration. After cytosolic 
translocation, late endosome-derived cathD juxtaposes actin filaments at the 
leading edge of lamellipodia. Suppressing cathD expression or blocking its 
cytosolic translocation impairs the maintenance but not the initiation of 
lamellipodial extension. Moreover, immature cathD balances the activity of the 
actin-severing protein cofilin to maintain globular-actin (G-actin) monomer pool 
for local actin recycling. Our study identifies cathD as a key lysosomal 
molecule that unconventionally contributes to actin cytoskeleton remodeling via 
cytosolic translocation during adenosine triphosphate-evoked microglia 
migration.

The spine is a frequent location for metastatic disease. As local control of 
primary tumor pathology continues to improve, survival rates improve and, by 
extension, the opportunity for metastasis increases. Breast, lung, and prostate 
cancer are the leading contributors to spinal metastases. Spinal metastases can 
manifest as bone pain, pathologic fractures, spinal instability, nerve root 
compression, and, in its most severe form, spinal cord compression. The global 
extent of disease, the spinal burden, neurologic status, and life expectancy 
help to categorize patients as to their candidacy for treatment options. 
Efficient identification and workup of those with spinal metastases will 
expedite the treatment cascade and improve quality of life.

Covid-19 Will Reduce US Life Expectancy at Birth by More Than One Year in 2020.

Los Angeles (UCLA).

On December 3rd, 2020, the cumulative number of U.S. Covid-19 deaths tallied by 
Johns Hopkins University (JHU) online dashboard reached 275,000, surpassing the 
number at which life table calculations show Covid-19 mortality will lower the 
U.S. life expectancy at birth (LEB) for 2020 by one full year. Such an impact on 
the U.S. LEB is unprecedented since the end of World War II. With additional 
deaths by the year end, the reduction in 2020 LEB induced by Covid-19 deaths 
will inexorably exceed one year. Factoring the expected continuation of secular 
gains against other causes of mortality, the U.S. LEB should still drop by more 
than a full year between 2019 and 2020. By comparison, the opioid-overdose 
crisis led to a decline in U.S. LEB averaging .1 year annually, from 78.9 years 
in 2014 to 78.6 years in 2017. At its peak, the HIV epidemic reduced the U.S. 
LEB by .3 year in a single year, from 75.8 years in 1992 to 75.5 years in 1993. 
As of now, the US LEB is expected to fall back to the level it first reached in 
2010. In other words, the impact of Covid-19 on U.S. mortality can be expected 
to cancel a decade of gains against all other causes of mortality combined.
