Using a poststructural perspective, we examine the subjectivities that are 
produced when advanced cancer patients seek life extension through biomedical 
treatments. Seven case studies were developed that included 20 interviews with 
patients, family, nurses, and physicians recruited from a tertiary hospital in 
Canada, 30 documents, and 5 hours of participant observation. We identify seven 
types of subjectivity: (a) the Desperate Subject, (b) the Cancer Expert Subject, 
(c) the Proactive Subject, (d) the Productive Subject, (e) the Mistrusting 
Subject, (f) the Model Patient Subject, and (g) the Suffering Subject. We 
characterize the "conflicted dying," a contemporary figure who holds multiple 
perspectives about seeking curative treatment despite the acknowledgment of 
death. Using active strategies to gain access to treatment, this figure resists 
traditional arrangements of power/knowledge established by health care 
providers. We suggest that the search for life extension is a process of shaping 
the self to fit certain aesthetical traits associated with surviving cancer.

AIMS: In Denmark life expectancy (LE) has increased since 1995 after a long 
period of stagnation. Healthy life expectancy (HLE) at age 65 increased more 
than LE during the period 1987-2005. The aim of the study was to determine the 
trend in HLE in Denmark at ages 50 and 65 during the period 2004-2011.
METHODS: The study was based on nationwide register data on mortality and data 
on health status from the SHARE surveys carried out in 2004/2005, 2006/2007 and 
2010/2011. Expected lifetime in various health states was estimated by 
Sullivan's method. Changes from 2004 to 2011 were decomposed into contributions 
from changes in mortality and prevalence of activity limitations.
RESULTS: During the period 2004-2011 LE increased by about 1 year at both age 50 
and age 65. However, the increase in expected lifetime in self-rated good 
health, without long-term health problems and without activity limitations was 
even longer in both genders and it increased by 1.5-4.0 years depending on age, 
gender and health indicator. Consequently, expected lifetime in an unhealthy 
state decreased and the proportions of lifetime in a healthy state increased. 
The disability effect of the health gain was stronger than the mortality effect.
CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark HLE increased substantially more than LE during the 
period 2004-2011 for all three health indicators at both age 50 and age 65, and 
for both genders. Thus, the improvement in health expectancy continued in 
Denmark in recent years.

The role of total serum testosterone in the prognosis of terminal cancer is 
unclear. We retrospectively investigated the total serum testosterone level in 
69 male patients with terminal cancer in a palliative care unit. The association 
between the serum testosterone level and survival was assessed using Cox 
proportional hazard model. The median value of serum total testosterone was 44.5 
ng/dL, far lower than previously reported in patients with advanced cancer. 
Multivariate analysis revealed thrombocytopenia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 
2.68), hypoalbuminemia (aHR, 2.02), azotemia (aHR, 2.67), and lower serum 
testosterone level (aHR, 2.03) were significantly negatively prognostic of 
survival. Lower serum testosterone level was an independent unfavorable 
prognostic factor for life expectancy in male patients with terminal cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy is increasing in Latin America resulting in the 
need for more family caregivers for older adults with dementia. The purpose of 
the current study was to examine the relationships between personal strengths 
(optimism, sense of coherence [SOC], and resilience) and the mental health of 
dementia caregivers from Latin America.
METHOD: Primary family dementia caregivers (n = 127) were identified via 
convenience sampling at the Instituto de Neurociencias de San Lucas, Argentina, 
and CETYS University, in Baja California, Mexico and completed measures of these 
constructs.
FINDINGS: Personal strengths explained between 32% and 50% of the variance in 
caregiver mental health. In a series of hierarchical multiple regressions, more 
manageability (β = -.38, p = .001), general resilience (β = -.24, p = .012), and 
social competence (β = -.21, p = .034) were uniquely associated with lower 
depression. Greater comprehensibility (β = -.28, p = .008) was uniquely 
associated with decreased burden, and manageability was marginally related (β = 
-.21, p< .10). Greater optimism (β = .37, p< .001) and manageability (β = .27, p 
= .004) were uniquely associated with increased life satisfaction.
DISCUSSION: The personal strengths of caregivers in Latin America may be 
particularly important for their mental health because of the culturally 
imbedded sense of duty toward older family members.
IMPLICATIONS: Incorporating strengths-based approaches into research on 
caregiver interventions in regions where caregiving is a highly culturally 
valued role such as Latin America may have the potential to improve the mental 
health of dementia caregivers.

Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Glossop Road, Sheffield, S10 2JF, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and 
efficacy/impact on quality of life (QoL, secondary objectives) of silodosin 8 mg 
once daily in men with LUTS/BPH.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men who completed the 12-week double-blind study with 
silodosin 8 mg, tamsulosin 0.4 mg, or placebo were offered to continue with the 
9-month open-label study during which all patients received silodosin 8 mg once 
daily. Safety was assessed by analysing vital signs, electrocardiograms, 
laboratory tests, and adverse events. Efficacy was evaluated with the 
International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS voiding and storage 
sub-scores, IPSS-QoL, and maximum urinary flow rate (Q max).
RESULTS: A total of 500 patients (mean age 66 years) entered the 9-month 
open-label study. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were experienced by 
33.4% patients. Ejaculation dysfunction was the most common TEAE (9.0%) but led 
to study discontinuations in only 1.6% of patients. Dizziness without 
orthostatic hypotension occurred in 0.8%. A marked reduction in total IPSS (-2.7 
± 3.8) was documented at the first visit of this extension phase in patients 
having de novo silodosin compared with lesser improvement in patients previously 
treated with silodosin (-0.82 ± 4.2) or tamsulosin (-0.83 ± 3.8). Improvements 
were maintained throughout the open-label phase. QoL also improved, with the 
greatest improvement in de novo silodosin patients. No relevant changes in Q max 
occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with silodosin was safe and efficacious. 
Abnormal ejaculation was the most common TEAE, but led to treatment 
discontinuation in only 1.6% of patients. Orthostatic hypotension was not seen, 
and only a few patients experienced dizziness.

BACKGROUND: Vaccination has been increasingly promoted to help control epidemic 
and endemic typhoid fever in high-incidence areas. Despite growing recognition 
that typhoid incidence in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa is similar to 
high-incidence areas of Asia, no large-scale typhoid vaccination campaigns have 
been conducted there. We performed an economic evaluation of a hypothetical 
one-time, fixed-post typhoid vaccination campaign in Kasese, a rural district in 
Uganda where a large, multi-year outbreak of typhoid fever has been reported.
METHODS: We used medical cost and epidemiological data retrieved on-site and 
campaign costs from previous fixed-post vaccination campaigns in Kasese to 
account for costs from a public sector health care delivery perspective. We 
calculated program costs and averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 
medical costs as a result of vaccination, to calculate the cost of the 
intervention per DALY and case averted.
RESULTS: Over the 3 years of projected vaccine efficacy, a one-time vaccination 
campaign was estimated to avert 1768 (90%CI: 684-4431) typhoid fever cases per 
year and a total of 3868 (90%CI: 1353-9807) DALYs over the duration of the 
immunity conferred by the vaccine. The cost of the intervention per DALY averted 
was US$ 484 (90%CI: 18-1292) and per case averted US$ 341 (90%CI: 13-883).
CONCLUSION: We estimated the vaccination campaign in this setting to be highly 
cost-effective, according to WHO's cost-effective guidelines. Results may be 
applicable to other African settings with similar high disease incidence 
estimates.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine associations between 
physicians' clinical assessments, their certainty in these assessments, and the 
likelihood of a patient-centered recommendation about colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening in the elderly.
METHODS: Two hundred seventy-six primary care physicians in the United States 
read 3 vignettes about an 80-year-old female patient and answered questions 
about her life expectancy, their confidence in their life expectancy estimate, 
the balance of benefits/downsides of CRC screening, their certainty in their 
benefit/downside assessment, and the best course of action regarding CRC 
screening. We used logistic regression to determine the relationship between 
these variables and patient-centered recommendations about CRC screening.
RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, physicians had higher odds of making a 
patient-centered recommendation about CRC screening when their clinical 
assessments did not lead to a clear screening recommendation or when they 
experienced uncertainty in their clinical assessments. However, in a 
multivariate regression model, only benefit/downside assessment and best course 
of action remained statistically significant predictors of a patient-centered 
recommendation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that when the results of clinical 
assessments do not lead to obvious screening decisions or when physicians feel 
uncertain about their clinical assessments, they are more likely to make 
patient-centered recommendations. Existing uncertainty frameworks do not 
adequately describe the uncertainty associated with patient-centered 
recommendations found in this study. Adapting or modifying these frameworks to 
better reflect the constructs associated with uncertainty and the interactions 
between uncertainty and the complexity inherent in clinical decisions will 
facilitate a more complete understanding of how and when physicians choose to 
include patients in clinical decisions.

PURPOSE: This multicenter, first-in-human study evaluated safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of BI-505, a human anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal 
antibody, in advanced relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BI-505 was given intravenously, every 2 weeks, at 
escalating doses from 0.0004 to 20 mg/kg, with extension of therapy until 
disease progression for responding or stable patients receiving 0.09 mg/kg or 
higher doses.
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were enrolled. The most common adverse events 
were fatigue, pyrexia, headache, and nausea. Adverse events were generally mild 
to moderate, and those attributed to study medication were mostly limited to the 
first dose and manageable with premedication and slower infusion. No maximum 
tolerated dose was identified. BI-505's half-life increased with dose while 
clearance decreased, suggesting target-mediated clearance. The ICAM-1 epitopes 
on patient bone marrow myeloma were completely saturated at 10 mg/kg doses. 
Using the International Myeloma Working Group criteria, 7 patients on extended 
therapy had stable disease for more than 2 months.
CONCLUSIONS: BI-505 can be safely administered at doses that saturate myeloma 
cell ICAM-1 receptors in patients. This study was registered at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01025206).

A comparison between standard methods and structural nested modelling when bias 
from a healthy worker survivor effect is suspected: an iron-ore mining cohort 
study.

OBJECTIVES: Iron-ore miners are exposed to extremely dusty and physically 
arduous work environments. The demanding activities of mining select healthier 
workers with longer work histories (ie, the Healthy Worker Survivor Effect 
(HWSE)), and could have a reversing effect on the exposure-response association. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate an iron-ore mining cohort to 
determine whether the effect of respirable dust was confounded by the presence 
of an HWSE.
METHODS: When an HWSE exists, standard modelling methods, such as Cox regression 
analysis, produce biased results. We compared results from g-estimation of 
accelerated failure-time modelling adjusted for HWSE with corresponding 
unadjusted Cox regression modelling results.
RESULTS: For all-cause mortality when adjusting for the HWSE, cumulative 
exposure from respirable dust was associated with a 6% decrease of life 
expectancy if exposed ≥15 years, compared with never being exposed. Respirable 
dust continued to be associated with mortality after censoring outcomes known to 
be associated with dust when adjusting for the HWSE. In contrast, results based 
on Cox regression analysis did not support that an association was present.
CONCLUSIONS: The adjustment for the HWSE made a difference when estimating the 
risk of mortality from respirable dust. The results of this study, therefore, 
support the recommendation that standard methods of analysis should be 
complemented with structural modelling analysis techniques, such as g-estimation 
of accelerated failure-time modelling, to adjust for the HWSE.

BACKGROUND: This article is part of a series commissioned by the International 
Epidemiological Association, aimed at describing population health and 
epidemiological resources in the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. It 
covers 32 of the 53 WHO European countries, namely the Western European 
countries, the Balkan countries and the Baltic countries.
METHODS: The burdens of mortality and morbidity and the patterns of risk factors 
and inequalities have been reviewed in order to identify health priorities and 
challenges. Literature and internet searches were conducted to stock-take 
epidemiological teaching, research activities, funding and scientific 
productivity.
FINDINGS: These countries have among the highest life expectancies worldwide. 
However, within- and between-country inequalities persist, which are largely due 
to inequalities in distribution of main health determinants. There is a long 
tradition of epidemiological research and teaching in most countries, in 
particular in the Western European countries. Cross-national networks and 
collaborations are increasing through the support of the European Union which 
fosters procedures to standardize educational systems across Europe and provides 
funding for epidemiological research through framework programmes. The number of 
Medline-indexed epidemiological research publications per year led by Western 
European countries has been increasing. The countries accounts for nearly a 
third of the global epidemiological publication.
CONCLUSIONS: Although population health has improved considerably overall, 
persistent within- and between-country inequalities continue to challenge 
national and European health institutions. More research, policy and action on 
the social determinants of health are required in the region. Epidemiological 
training, research and workforce in the Baltic and Balkan countries should be 
strengthened. European epidemiologists can play pivotal roles and must influence 
legislation concerning production and access to high-quality data.

INTRODUCTION: The long-term efficacy and safety of donepezil 10 mg in patients 
with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were investigated in a 52-week Phase 3 
trial.
METHODS: This 52-week study consisted of 16-week randomized placebo-controlled 
(RCT) and 36-week open-label extension phases. Of 142 DLB patients enrolled in 
the RCT phase (three arms: placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg), 110 entered the extension 
phase. The placebo group of the RCT phase initiated active treatment at week 16, 
and the active groups maintained allocated treatment and dosages until week 24. 
After week 24, all patients received 10 mg. Dose reduction to 5 mg for safety 
concerns was allowed. Efficacy measures included Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) for cognitive function and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for 
behavioral symptoms. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) and the 
unified Parkinson disease rating scale.
RESULTS: In total, 100 subjects completed the study. Cognitive function 
improvement was sustained for 52 weeks (MMSE at week 52 in 10 mg: 2.8 ± 3.5 
(mean ± standard deviation); P <0.001, Student paired t test)). Those who 
received placebo in the RCT phase showed an improvement after starting active 
treatment. NPI improved in all the groups throughout the study, including the 
placebo period. In the subgroup of the 5 mg group without remarkable cognitive 
or behavioral improvement at week 24, further improvement was observed after a 
dose increase to 10 mg. After week 24, 21 patients experienced dose reduction. 
The incidence of any AEs did not increase over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term administration of donepezil at 10 mg/day improved 
cognitive function for up to 52 weeks in patients with DLB without increasing 
the risk of clinically significant safety events.

Resistance training (RT) can provide several benefits for individuals with Type 
2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of resistance 
training on the strength levels and uric acid (UA) concentration in individuals 
with Type 2 diabetes. The study included 68 patients (57.7±9.0 years) that 
participated in an organized program of RT for 12 weeks. The volunteers were 
divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG; n=34) that performed the 
resistance training program consisting of seven exercises executed in an 
alternating order based on segments; and a control group (CG; n=34) that 
maintained their normal daily life activities. Muscle strength and uric acid 
were measured both pre- and post-experiment. The results showed a significant 
increase in strength of the subjects in the EG for all exercises included in the 
study (p<0.001). Comparing the strength levels of the post-test, intergroup 
differences were found in supine sitting (p<0.001), leg extension (p<0.001), 
shoulder press (p<0.001), leg curl (p=0.001), seated row (p<0.001), leg press 
(p=0.001) and high pulley (p<0.001). The measured uric acid was significantly 
increased in both experimental and control groups (p<0.001 and p=0.001, 
respectively). The intergroup comparison showed a significant increase for the 
EG (p=0.024). We conclude that the training program was effective for strength 
gains despite an increase in uric acid in Type 2 diabetics.

BACKGROUND: The position of invasive urodynamic testing in the diagnostic 
pathway for urinary incontinence (UI) is unclear. Systematic reviews have called 
for further trials evaluating clinical utility, although a preliminary 
feasibility study was considered appropriate.
OBJECTIVES: To inform the decision whether or not to proceed to a definitive 
randomised trial of invasive urodynamic testing compared with clinical 
assessment with non-invasive tests, prior to surgery in women with stress UI 
(SUI) or stress predominant mixed UI (MUI).
DESIGN: A mixed-methods study comprising a pragmatic multicentre randomised 
pilot trial; economic evaluation; survey of clinicians' views about invasive 
urodynamic testing; qualitative interviews with clinicians and trial 
participants.
SETTING: Urogynaecology, female urology and general gynaecology units in 
Newcastle, Leicester, Swansea, Sheffield, Northumberland, Gateshead and South 
Tees.
PARTICIPANTS: Trial recruits were women with SUI or stress predominant MUI who 
were considering surgery after unsuccessful conservative treatment. Relevant 
clinicians completed two online surveys. Subsets of survey respondents and trial 
participants took part in separate qualitative interview studies.
INTERVENTIONS: Pilot trial participants were randomised to undergo clinical 
assessment with non-invasive tests (control arm); or assessment as controls, 
plus invasive urodynamic testing (intervention arm).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Confirmation that units can identify and recruit eligible 
women; acceptability of investigation strategies and data collection tools; 
acquisition of outcome data to determine the sample size for a definitive trial. 
The proposed primary outcome for the definitive trial was International 
Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire (ICIQ) Female Lower Urinary 
Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS) (total score) 6 months after surgery or the start of 
non-surgical treatment; secondary outcomes included: ICIQ-FLUTS (subscales); 
ICIQ Urinary Incontinence Short Form; ICIQ Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality 
of Life; Urogenital Distress Inventory; EuroQol-5D; costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY, Short Form 12; 3-day bladder 
diary.
RESULTS: Of 284 eligible women, 222 (78%) were recruited; 165/219 (75%) returned 
questionnaires at baseline and 125/200 (63%) who were sent questionnaires at 
follow-up. There were few missing data items in returned questionnaires, with 
individual outcome scales calculable for 81%-94%. Most women underwent surgery; 
management plans were changed in 19 (19%) participants following invasive 
urodynamic testing. Participant Costs Questionnaires were returned by 53% 6 
months after treatment; complete data to undertake cost-utility analysis were 
available in 27% (intervention) and 47% (control). While insufficient to 
recommend changes in practice, the results suggest further research would be 
valuable. All clinicians responding to the survey had access to invasive 
urodynamic testing, and most saw it as essential prior to surgery in women with 
SUI with or without other symptoms; nevertheless, 70% considered the research 
question underlying INVESTIGATE important and most were willing to randomise 
patients in a definitive trial. Participants interviewed were positive about the 
trial and associated documentation; the desire of some women to avoid invasive 
urodynamic testing contrasted with opinions expressed by clinicians through both 
survey and interview responses.
CONCLUSIONS: All elements of a definitive trial and economic evaluation were 
rehearsed; several areas for protocol modification were identified. Such a trial 
would require to 400-900 participants, depending on the difference in primary 
outcome sought.
FUTURE WORK: A definitive trial of invasive urodynamic testing versus clinical 
assessment prior to surgery for SUI or stress predominant MUI should be 
undertaken.

Trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) selects one of the 2 co-circulating influenza 
B lineages whereas quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) includes both lineages. 
We examined potential cost-effectiveness of QIV versus TIV from perspectives of 
healthcare provider and society of Hong Kong. A decision tree was designed to 
simulate the outcomes of QIV vs. TIV in 6 age groups: 0-4 years, 5-9 years, 
10-14 years, 15-64 years, 65-79 y and ≥80 years. Direct cost alone, direct and 
indirect costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss due to 
TIV-unmatched influenza B infection were simulated for each study arm. Outcome 
measure was incremental cost per QALY (ICER). In base-case analysis, QIV was 
more effective than TIV in all-age population with additional direct cost per 
QALY (ICER-direct cost) and additional total cost per QALY (ICER-total cost) of 
USD 22,603 and USD 12,558, respectively. Age-stratified analysis showed that QIV 
was cost-effective in age groups 6 months to 9 y and ≥80 years from provider's 
perspective, and it was cost-effective in all age group except 15-64 y from 
societal perspective. Percentage of TIV-unmatched influenza B in circulation and 
additional vaccine cost of QIV were key influential factors. From perspectives 
of healthcare provider and society, QIV was the preferred option in 52.77% and 
66.94% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. QIV appears to be 
cost-effective in Hong Kong population, except for age group 15-64 years, from 
societal perspective. From healthcare provider's perspective, QIV seems to be 
cost-effective in very young (6 months-9 years) and older (≥80 years) age 
groups.

Estoril, Portugal; ¶Department of Neurosurgery, University of Münster, Münster, 
Germany.

BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas are aggressive, incurable tumors characterized by 
extensive diffuse invasion of the normal brain parenchyma. Novel therapies at 
best prolong survival; their costs are formidable and benefit is marginal. 
Economic restrictions thus require knowledge of the cost-effectiveness of 
treatments. Here, we show the cost-effectiveness of enhanced resections in 
malignant glioma surgery using a well-characterized tool for intraoperative 
tumor visualization, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 5-ALA fluorescence-guided 
neurosurgery compared with white-light surgery in adult patients with newly 
diagnosed high-grade glioma, adopting the perspective of the Portuguese National 
Health Service.
METHODS: We used a Markov model (cohort simulation). Transition probabilities 
were estimated with the use of data from 1 randomized clinical trial and 1 
noninterventional prospective study. Utility values and resource use were 
obtained from published literature and expert opinion. Unit costs were taken 
from official Portuguese reimbursement lists (2012 values). The health outcomes 
considered were quality-adjusted life-years, life-years, and progression-free 
life-years. Extensive 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are below &OV0556;10 000 in 
all evaluated outcomes, being around &OV0556;9100 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained, &OV0556;6700 per life-year gained, and &OV0556;8800 per progression-free 
life-year gained. The probability of 5-ALA fluorescence-guided surgery 
cost-effectiveness at a threshold of &OV0556;20000 is 96.0% for quality-adjusted 
life-year, 99.6% for life-year, and 98.8% for progression-free life-year.
CONCLUSION: 5-ALA fluorescence-guided surgery appears to be cost-effective in 
newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas compared with white-light surgery. This 
example demonstrates cost-effectiveness analyses for malignant glioma surgery to 
be feasible on the basis of existing data.

Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York.

Obesity is a major health priority in the United States, as well as globally. It 
is associated with multiple comorbidities and reduced life expectancy. Effective 
management of obesity involves producing an intervention plan tailored to the 
individual patient. Potential contributory factors to weight gain, including 
dietary habits, physical inactivity, associated medical conditions, and 
medications, should be identified and addressed. Lifestyle interventions 
comprising diet modification, physical activity, and behavior therapy are 
foundational to the management of obesity. Caloric restriction is the most 
important component in achieving weight loss through negative energy balance, 
whereas sustained physical activity is important in maintaining the weight loss. 
Adjunctive therapies in the form of pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery are 
required in patients who do not achieve targeted weight loss and health goals 
with lifestyle interventions. Currently there are 3 drugs approved for long-term 
management of obesity, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate extended release, and 
lorcaserin, and there are 2 on the horizon, bupropion/naltrexone and 
liraglutide. Bariatric surgery is an effective strategy recognized to produce 
durable weight loss with amelioration of obesity-related comorbidities and 
should be considered a treatment option in eligible patients.

Trabeculectomy in Patients With Glaucoma Over 80 Years of Age: Relatively 
Short-term Outcomes.

PURPOSE: To compare the surgical outcomes of trabeculectomy performed in elderly 
patients (above 80 y) with those of younger controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who 
underwent trabeculectomy from January 1, 2009 through April 30, 2011 at the 
Wills Eye Hospital. Patients over 80 years of age were compared with younger 
controls. Outcome measures included intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, 
number of glaucoma medications, surgical complications, and surgical failure. 
Surgical failure was defined as when IOP>21 mm Hg or <20% reduction below 
baseline or IOP<5 mm Hg or reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light 
perception.
RESULTS: Eighty-six eyes of patients over 80 years of age (range, 81 to 94 y) 
were compared with 86 eyes of younger controls (range, 22 to 79 y). Mean 
follow-up time was 23.9±8.0 and 25.1±8.0 months for each group, respectively. 
After 1 year, the failure rate was 31.3% in the elderly group, compared with 
29.5% in the control group (P=0.98). At last follow-up visit, the rate of 
failure between the groups was similar (P=0.35). Postoperative complications 
were similar between the groups (P=0.25).
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical outcomes of trabeculectomy in patients older than 80 
years were found to be similar to those of younger controls. Taking into 
consideration elderly glaucoma patients' general health condition and life 
expectancy, age alone may not be a barrier to performing glaucoma filtration 
surgery.

Alcohol use/dependence are an important risk factor for cirrhosis of the liver. 
The article aims to describe and conduct a comparative analysis of Disability 
Adjusted Life Years (DALY), Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with 
Disability (YLD) of alcohol use disorders and non-viral cirrhosis in Brazil in 
2008. DALY was calculated as the sum of YLL and YLD. For YLL estimates, the mean 
number of deaths from 2007- 2009 in the country was considered. After revision 
of epidemiological data, prevalence of each disease was modelled with the DisMod 
tool, which generated incidence data for YLD estimates. Alcohol and non-viral 
cirrhosis were responsible for 3% and 1% of total DALYs, respectively. In both 
diseases, men contributed to a greater proportion of DALYs. Among the first ten 
causes of DALYs, alcohol use disorders occupied the second, third and sixth 
positions at the ages of 15-29, 30-44 and 45- 59, respectively. Non-viral 
cirrhosis was the eighth cause of DALY in the 30-44 age group in men; the fifth, 
in the 45-59 group and the eighth, in the 60-69 group. Age distribution suggests 
that interventions directed against alcohol use/dependence would have effects on 
the burden of alcoholic cirrhosis in the country.

Morbidity and mortality associated with injuries: results of the Global Burden 
of Disease study in Brazil, 2008.

Campos MR, von Doellinger Vdos R, Mendes LV, Costa Mde F, Pimentel TG, Schramm 
JM.

The aim of this study was to estimate the global burden of disease from external 
causes in 2008 in Brazil, based on DALYs (disability-adjusted life years). YLLs 
(years of life lost) were estimated according to the method proposed by Murray & 
Lopez (1996). Meanwhile, the method for estimating YLDs (years lived with 
disability) included methodological adjustments taking the Brazilian reality 
into account. The study showed a total of 195 DALYs per 100 thousand 
inhabitants, of which 19 DALYs were related to external causes. Among YLLs, 48% 
were from unintentional causes and 52% from intentional causes. Among YLDs, 
unintentional causes predominated, with 95%. The share of YLLs in DALYs was 90%. 
The cause with the highest proportion of YLLs was "homicide and violence" (43%), 
followed by "road traffic accidents" (31%). Falls accounted for the highest 
share of YLDs (36%). The sex ratio (male-to-female) was 4.8 for DALYs, and the 
predominant age bracket was 15-29 years. Since external causes are avoidable, 
the study provides potentially useful information for policymakers in public 
security and health.

Developing a multi-criteria approach for drug reimbursement decision making: an 
initial step forward.

Dionne F, Mitton C, Dempster B, Lynd LD.

BACKGROUND: Coverage decisions for a new drug revolve around the balance between 
perceived value and price. But what is the perceived value of a new drug? 
Traditionally, the assessment of such value has largely revolved around the 
estimation of cost-effectiveness. However, very few will argue that the 
cost-effectiveness ratio presents a fulsome picture of 'value'. Multi-criteria 
decision analysis (MCDA) has been advocated as an alternative to 
cost-effectiveness analysis and it has been argued that it better reflects real 
world decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project was to address the issue of the lack of 
a satisfactory methodology to measure value for drugs by developing a framework 
to operationalize an MCDA approach incorporating societal values as they pertain 
to the value of drugs.
METHODS: Two workshops were held, one in Toronto in conjunction with the CAPT 
annual conference, and one in Ottawa, as part of the annual CADTH Symposium. 
Notes were taken at both workshops and the data collected was analyzed using a 
grounded theory approach. The intent was to reflect, as accurately as possible, 
what was said at the workshops, without normative judgement.
RESULTS: Results to date are a set of guiding principles and criteria. There are 
currently ten criteria: Comparative effectiveness, Adoption feasibility, Risks 
of adverse events, Patient autonomy, Societal benefit, Equity, Strength of 
evidence, Incidence/prevalence/severity of condition, Innovation, and Disease 
prevention/ health promotion.
CONCLUSION: Much progress has been made and it is now time to share the results. 
Feedback will determine the final shape of the framework proposed.

[The duration of an HIV infection course and its influencing factors].

[Article in Russian]

Pokrovskaya AV, Popova AA, Ladnaya NN, Yurin OG.

AIM: To study the duration of the natural course of HIV infection and to 
identify its influencing factors.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 938 outpatient case histories of adult HIV-positive 
patients registered at the dispensary and the data of 3403 AIDS patients 
registered in the computer base, including those on 2588 dead people, were 
retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression 
model were used. Gender, age, and route of infection were regarded as potential 
factors influencing the natural course of HIV infection.
RESULTS: In Russia before the mass use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the
