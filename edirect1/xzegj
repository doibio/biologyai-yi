The imbalance between life expectancy and quality of life is increasing due to 
the raising prevalence of chronic diseases. Musculoskeletal disorders and 
chronic wounds affect a growing percentage of people and demand more efficient 
tools for regenerative medicine. Scaffolds that can better mimic the natural 
physical stimuli that tissues receive under healthy conditions and during 
healing may significantly aid the regeneration process. Shape, mechanical 
properties, pore size and interconnectivity have already been demonstrated to be 
relevant scaffold features that can determine cell adhesion and differentiation. 
Much less attention has been paid to scaffolds that can deliver more dynamic 
physical stimuli, such as electrical signals. Recent developments in the precise 
measurement of electrical fields in vivo have revealed their key role in cell 
movement (galvanotaxis), growth, activation of secondary cascades, and 
differentiation to different lineages in a variety of tissues, not just neural. 
Piezoelectric scaffolds can mimic the natural bioelectric potentials and 
gradients in an autonomous way by generating the electric stimuli themselves 
when subjected to mechanical loads or, if the patient or the tissue lacks 
mobility, ultrasound irradiation. This review provides an analysis on endogenous 
bioelectrical signals, recent developments on piezoelectric scaffolds for bone, 
cartilage, tendon and nerve regeneration, and their main outcomes in vivo. Wound 
healing with piezoelectric dressings is addressed in the last section with 
relevant examples of performance in animal models. Results evidence that a fine 
adjustment of material composition and processing (electrospinning, corona 
poling, 3D printing, annealing) provides scaffolds that act as true emitters of 
electrical stimuli that activate endogenous signaling pathways for more 
efficient and long-term tissue repair.

BACKGROUND: Silicosis, a severe lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust, 
predominantly affects workers in industries such as mining and construction, 
leading to a significant global public health challenge. The purpose of this 
study is to analyze the current disease burden of silicosis and to predict the 
development trend of silicosis in the future the world by extracting data from 
the GBD database.
METHODS: We extracted and analyzed silicosis prevalence, incidence, mortality, 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) data from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2019 program for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. The 
association between the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and the burden of 
age-standardized rates (ASRs) of DALYs has been examined at the regional level. 
Jointpoint regression analysis has been also performed to evaluate global burden 
trends of silicosis from 1990 to 2019. Furthermore, Nordpred age-period-cohort 
analysis has also been projected to predict future the burden of silicosis from 
2019 to 2044.
RESULTS: In 2019, global ASRs for silicosis prevalence, incidence, mortality, 
and DALYs were 5.383, 1.650, 0.161, and 7.872%, respectively which are lower 
than that in 1990. The populations of 45-59 age group were more susceptible to 
silicosis, while those aged 80 or above suffered from higher mortality and DALY 
risks. In 2019, the most impacted nations by the burden of silicosis included 
China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Chile. From 1990 to 2019, 
most regions observed a declining burden of silicosis. An "M" shaped association 
between SDI and ASRs of DALYs for silicosis was observed from 1990 to 2019. The 
age-period-cohort analysis forecasted a decreasing trend of the burden of 
silicosis from 2019 to 2044.
CONCLUSION: Despite the overall decline in the global silicosis burden from 1990 
to 2019, some regions witnessed a notable burden of this disease, emphasizing 
the importance of targeted interventions. Our results may provide a reference 
for the subsequent development of appropriate management strategies.

AIM: To report the global, regional, and national burden of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) in 2019, assess its trends in the past, and forecast its trends 
in the future.
METHODS: The main data source was the Global Burden of Disease 2019 database. We 
assessed the changes in T2DM burden from 1990 to 2019 with joinpoint regression 
analysis. Age-period-cohort analysis was used to forecast the T2DM incidence and 
mortality rate from 2020 to 2034.
RESULTS: The burden of T2DM has increased from 1990 to 2019 generally. The 
low-middle socio-demographic index (SDI) region had the highest increase in 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized disability-adjusted 
life years (ASDR) due to T2DM. Nationally, the increase in ASIR (r=0.151, 
p=0.046) and the decrease in ASMR (r=0.355, p<0.001) were positively correlated 
with SDIs. In 2019, the global ASIR, ASPR, ASMR, ASDR due to T2DM were 259.9 
(95% UI 240.3-281.4), 5282.9 (95% UI 4853.6-5752.1), 18.5 (95% UI 17.2-19.7), 
and 801.5 (95% UI 55477000-79005200) per 100,000 population, respectively. 
Additionally, the ASIR (r=0.153, p=0.030) and ASPR (r=0.159, p=0.024) of T2DM 
were positively correlated with SDIs, while ASMR (r=-0.226, p=0.001) and ASDR 
(r=-0.171, p=0.015) due to T2DM were negatively correlated with SDIs. The ASIR 
was estimated to increase to 284.42, and ASMR was estimated to increase to 19.1 
from 2030 to 2034, per 100,000 population.
CONCLUSION: Globally, the burden of T2DM has increased in the past and was 
forecast to continue increasing. Greater investment in T2DM prevention is 
needed.

BACKGROUND: Improved health care for people with Down syndrome (DS) has resulted 
in an increase in their life expectancy therefore increasing comorbidities 
associated with age-related problems in this population, the most frequent being 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, several cognitive tests have been developed 
to evaluate cognitive changes related to the development of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and AD in people with DS.
OBJECTIVE: Identify and evaluate available cognitive tests for the diagnosis of 
MCI and AD in people with DS.
METHODS: A systematic search of the Pubmed and PsycInfo databases was performed 
to identify articles published from January 1, 2000 and July 1, 2022. Keysearch 
terms were DS, AD or MCI, cognition, and assessment. Relevant studies assessing 
the diagnostic accuracy of cognitive tests for AD or MCI with standard clinical 
evaluation were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS 2.
RESULTS: We identified 15 batteries, 2 intelligence scales, 14 memory tests, 11 
executive, functioning tests, 11 motor and visuospatial functioning tests, 5 
language tests, 3 attention tests, and 2 orientation tests. Analysis showed that 
the CAMCOG-DS present a fair to excellent diagnostic accuracy for detecting AD 
in patients with DS. However, for the diagnosis of MCI, this battery showed poor 
to good diagnostic accuracy.
CONCLUSION: The findings highlight important limitations of the current 
assessment available for the screening of mild cognitive impairment and AD in 
patients with DS and support the need for more clinical trials to ensure better 
screening for this highly at-risk population.

BACKGROUND: The disease burden attributable to chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) is significant worldwide. Some studies have linked exposure to 
air pollution to COPD, but there has been little research on this.
METHODS: We aimed to assess the COPD-related disease burden attributable to air 
pollution from multiple epidemiological perspectives. This study conducted a 
three-stage analysis. Firstly, we reported on the burden of disease worldwide in 
2019 by different subgroups including sex, age, region, and country. Secondly, 
we studied the trends in disease burden from 1990 to 2019. Finally, we explored 
the association of some national indicators with disease burden to look for risk 
factors.
RESULTS: In 2019, the death number of COPD associated with air pollution 
accounted for 2.32% of the total global death, and the number of DALY accounted 
for 1.12% of the global DALY. From 1990 to 2019, the death number of COPD 
associated with air pollution increased peaked at 1.41 million in 1993, 
fluctuated, and then declined. We found the same temporal pattern of DALY. The 
corresponding age-standardized rates had been falling. At the same time, the 
burden of COPD associated with air pollution was also affected by some national 
indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that air pollution-related COPD contributed to 
a significant global disease burden. We called for health policymakers to take 
action and interventions targeting vulnerable countries and susceptible 
populations.

Cyclophosphamide has drastically enhanced the expectancy and quality of life of 
cancer patients. However, it is accompanied by diverse neurological 
complications which are considered a dose-limiting adverse effect. Neurotoxicity 
caused by cyclophosphamide can manifest in numerous manners including anxiety, 
depression, motor dysfunction and cognitive deficits. This review article offers 
an overview on cyclophosphamide-induced neurotoxicity, providing a unified point 
of view on the possible underlying molecular mechanisms including oxidative 
brain damage, neuroinflammation, apoptotic neuronal cell death as well as 
disruption of the balance of brain neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors. 
Besides, this review sheds light on the promising protective agents that have 
been investigated using preclinical animal models as well as their biological 
targets and protection mechanisms. Despite promising results in experimental 
models, none of these agents has been studied in clinical trials. Thus, there is 
lack of evidence to advocate the use of any neuroprotective agent in the 
clinical setting. Furthermore, none of the protective agents has been evaluated 
for its effect on the anticancer activity of cyclophosphamide in tumor-bearing 
animals. Therefore, there is a great necessity for adequate well-designed 
clinical studies for evaluation of the therapeutic values of these candidates. 
Conclusively, this review summarizes the molecular mechanisms accounting for 
cyclophosphamide-induced neurotoxicity together with the potential protective 
strategies seeking for downgrading this neurological complication, thus 
enhancing the quality of life and well-being of cancer patients treated with 
cyclophosphamide.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to reveal the association between the 
other-cause mortality (OCM) and post-radical prostatectomy (RP) salvage 
radiotherapy (sRT) in men with prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out with patients who had PCa and 
underwent RP ± sRT in a high-volume cancer center between 2005 and February 
2019. Data from 1955 patients were subjected to a 1:1 matching for age, initial 
PSA, pathological (p)T/N stages, and ISUP score, which yielding 439 RP + RT 
(group 1) vs 439 RP-only cases (group 2), without any residual difference. 
Primary and secondary endpoints of the study were OCM and cancer-specific 
mortality (CSM). Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and cox regression tests were used for 
purpose of the study.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time after RP was 5.3 years (interquartile range: 
4.0-7.3). After matching, of all deaths that occurred during the study period, 
16 in group 1 and 35 in group 2 were attributed to other causes (p = 0.006). 
5-year OCM rate of patients who received sRT (1.2%) was significantly lower 
compared to patients that underwent RP-only (4.4%, p < 0.001). 19 versus 16 
patients died of PCa, respectively (p = 0.61). There was no CSM risk difference 
between groups (p = 0.29). Older patients had an increased risk of OCM (hazard 
ratio [HR]:1.10 [95%CI 1.05-1.17], p < 0.001) and post-RP RT was associated with 
lower OCM (HR: 0.28 [95%CI 0.15-0.51], p < 0.001) in multivariable model. pT/N 
stages and ISUP score were strongly associated with CSM, but not with OCM.
CONCLUSION: OCM was not higher in patients who had sRT with or without ADT. 
Excess OCM in favor of RP-only patients may be cautiously explained with 
higher-performance status/life expectancy of patients who selected for RT after 
RP in our cohort.

BACKGROUND: Research has shown that ingesting 0.3 g·kg-1 body mass sodium 
bicarbonate (NaHCO3) can improve time-to-exhaustion (TTE) cycling performance, 
but the influence of psychophysiological mechanisms on ergogenic effects is not 
yet understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study retrospectively examined whether changes in TTE cycling 
performance are mediated by positive expectations of receiving NaHCO3 and/or the 
decline in blood bicarbonate during exercise.
METHODS: In a randomised, crossover, counterbalanced, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled design, 12 recreationally trained cyclists (maximal oxygen 
consumption, 54.4 ± 5.7 mL·kg·min-1) performed four TTE cycling tests 90 min 
after consuming: (1) 0.3 g·kg-1 body mass NaHCO3 in 5 mL·kg-1 body mass 
solution, (2) 0.03 g·kg-1 body mass sodium chloride in solution (placebo), (3) 
0.3 g·kg-1 body mass NaHCO3 in capsules and (4) cornflour in capsules (placebo). 
Prior to exercise, participants rated on 1-5 Likert type scales how much they 
expected the treatment they believe had been given would improve performance. 
Capillary blood samples were measured for acid-base balance at baseline, 
pre-exercise and post-exercise.
RESULTS: Administering NaHCO3 in solution and capsules improved TTE compared 
with their respective placebos (solution: 27.0 ± 21.9 s, p = 0.001; capsules: 
23.0 ± 28.1 s, p = 0.016). Compared to capsules, NaHCO3 administered via 
solution resulted in a higher expectancy about the benefits on TTE cycling 
performance (Median: 3.5 vs. 2.5, Z = 2.135, p = 0.033). Decline in blood 
bicarbonate during exercise was higher for NaHCO3 given in solution compared to 
capsules (2.7 ± 2.1 mmol·L-1, p = 0.001). Mediation analyses showed that 
improvements in TTE cycling were indirectly related to expectancy and decline in 
blood bicarbonate when NaHCO3 was administered in solution but not capsules.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants' higher expectations when NaHCO3 is administered in 
solution could result in them exerting themselves harder during TTE cycling, 
which subsequently leads to a greater decline in blood bicarbonate and larger 
improvements in performance.
KEY POINTS: Ingesting 0.3 g·kg-1 body mass sodium bicarbonate in solution and 
capsules improved time-to-exhaustion cycling performance Positive expectancy 
about the benefits of sodium bicarbonate and decline in blood bicarbonate were 
higher when sodium bicarbonate was administered in solution compared with 
capsules Improvements in time-to-exhaustion cycling performance for sodium 
bicarbonate administered in solution were related to expectancy and the enhanced 
extracellular buffering response.

Living longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health 
("health span") is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic 
strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial 
metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health 
span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide 
delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are 
unknown. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans aging model, we compared untargeted H2S 
(NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH2S (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life 
span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H2S donors were 
administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 
postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network 
analysis explored molecular events governing mtH2S donor-mediated health span. 
Developmentally administered mtH2S (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. 
equivalent untargeted H2S doses. mtH2S preserved aging mitochondrial structure, 
content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H2S 
metabolism enzymes and FoxO/daf-16 prevented the positive health span effects of 
mtH2S, whereas DCAF11/wdr-23 - Nrf2/skn-1 oxidative stress protection pathways 
were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset 
mtH2S treatments. Adult mtH2S treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by 
minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and 
peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by the 
elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor circuit. H2S health span extension likely acts 
at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span 
across adult vs. developmental treatment timings. The small mtH2S doses required 
for health span extension, combined with efficacy in adult animals, suggest 
mtH2S is a potential healthy aging therapeutic.

DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this updated guidance statement is to guide 
clinicians on screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) in asymptomatic average-risk 
adults. The intended audience is all clinicians. The population is asymptomatic 
adults at average risk for CRC.
METHODS: This updated guidance statement was developed using recently published 
and critically appraised clinical guidelines from national guideline developers 
since the publication of the American College of Physicians' 2019 guidance 
statement, "Screening for Colorectal Cancer in Asymptomatic Average-Risk 
Adults." The authors searched for national guidelines from the United States and 
other countries published in English using PubMed and the Guidelines 
International Network library from 1 January 2018 to 24 April 2023. The authors 
also searched for updates of guidelines included in the first version of our 
guidance statement. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II 
(AGREE II) instrument was used to assess the quality of eligible guidelines. Two 
guidelines were selected for adoption and adaptation by raters on the basis of 
the highest average overall AGREE II quality scores. The evidence reviews and 
modeling studies for these 2 guidelines were also used to synthesize the 
evidence of diagnostic test accuracy, effectiveness, and harms of CRC screening 
interventions and to develop our guidance statements.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: Clinicians should start screening for colorectal cancer in 
asymptomatic average-risk adults at age 50 years.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: Clinicians should consider not screening asymptomatic 
average-risk adults between the ages of 45 to 49 years. Clinicians should 
discuss the uncertainty around benefits and harms of screening in this 
population.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: Clinicians should stop screening for colorectal cancer in 
asymptomatic average-risk adults older than 75 years or in asymptomatic 
average-risk adults with a life expectancy of 10 years or less.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4A: Clinicians should select a screening test for colorectal 
cancer in consultation with their patient based on a discussion of benefits, 
harms, costs, availability, frequency, and patient values and preferences.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4B: Clinicians should select among a fecal immunochemical or 
high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test every 2 years, colonoscopy every 
10 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus a fecal immunochemical 
test every 2 years as a screening test for colorectal cancer.
GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4C: Clinicians should not use stool DNA, computed tomography 
colonography, capsule endoscopy, urine, or serum screening tests for colorectal 
cancer.

The study aimed to examine the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in 
patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). A total of 24 patients with PH were 
included in the randomized controlled evaluator-blind study. IMT was performed 
at 40% to 60% of the maximal inspiratory pressure for 30 min/d, 7 d/wk (1 day 
supervised) for 8 weeks. Respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea, diaphragm 
thickness (DT), pulmonary functions, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP), 
arterial stiffness, exercise capacity, upper extremity functional exercise 
capacity, physical activity levels, fatigue, anxiety-depression levels, 
activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life were evaluated. A total of 
24 patients (treatment = 12, control = 12) completed the 8-week follow-up. There 
was no significant difference between the patient groups in terms of demographic 
and clinical characteristics (p >0.05). Considering the change between the 
groups in the treatment and control groups, brachial and central BP, dyspnea, 
respiratory muscle strength, DT in total lung capacity, knee extension muscle 
strength, functional exercise capacity, upper extremity functional exercise 
capacity, physical activity, ADL, fatigue, anxiety, and quality of life improved 
in favor of the IMT group (p <0.05). In conclusion, IMT has improved brachial 
and central BP, dyspnea, respiratory muscle strength, DT in total lung capacity, 
knee extension muscle strength, functional exercise capacity, upper extremity 
functional exercise capacity, physical activity, ADL, fatigue, anxiety, and 
quality of life compared with the control group. IMT is an effective method in 
cardiopulmonary rehabilitation for patients with PH.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the alignment of national health priorities with a 
country's burden of disease as measured by disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs).
METHODS: We identified priorities in national health plans and the 20 most 
burdensome conditions measured by DALYs from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease 
Study. We computed point-biserial correlations (rpb) between DALYs and being 
nominated as a health priority and the pooled proportion (95% confidence 
intervals [CIs]) of the 20 most burdensome conditions nominated as a priority 
across countries.
RESULTS: We identified national health plans and official governmental websites 
in 145 countries. There was little to no correlation (rpb = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02 
to 0.09) between national DALY data and whether a condition was nominated as a 
health priority. The pooled proportion of the 20 most burdensome conditions 
nominated as priorities across countries was 46%. HIV/AIDS had the greatest 
number of nominations as a national health priority (62 countries) as well as 
the greatest match with the burden of disease (among the top 20 most burdensome 
conditions in 51 [82%] countries). Low back pain, headache disorders and 
congenital birth defects had the lowest proportion of nominations as health 
priorities in countries where they were in the top 20 most burdensome conditions 
(6%, 6% and 11%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Globally, there were low correlations between national health 
priorities and GBD estimates on disease burden. Failing to prioritise health 
priorities according to burden may mean that insufficient resources have been 
directed to improve health outcomes for people with those health conditions.

Hospice care offers multidisciplinary expertise to optimize symptom management 
and quality of life for patients with limited life expectancy and help ensure 
that patients receive care that reflects their personal goals and values. Many 
patients receiving conservative kidney management (CKM) and their loved ones can 
benefit from the additional support that hospice provides, particularly as 
symptom burdens and functional status worsen over the last few months of life. 
We provide an overview of hospice services and how they may benefit patients 
receiving CKM, describe the evolution of optimal CKM strategies and 
collaboration between nephrology and hospice clinicians over the course of 
disease progression, and explore challenges to effective hospice care delivery 
for patients with chronic kidney disease and how to address them.

INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need for knowledge about the transgender 
population to inform the development of clinical protocols and training of 
health professionals on the unique issues affecting this population. Discussing 
transgender quality of life (QoL) through the lens of social determinants of 
health (SDOHs) would enable gender-specific health interventions. Here, we aimed 
to review the evidence on the QoL of transgender people from an SDOH 
perspective.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review (ScR) protocol following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews statement and guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute was used. 
MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and 
registry sites such as ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP will be searched. 
Additional sources to be searched include ProQuest Dissertations/Theses Global, 
British Library, Google Scholar and Preprints for Health Sciences-medRXiv. Two 
independent researchers will carry out the selection, data charting and data 
synthesis. No date restriction will be applied in this ScR. The search will be 
restricted to articles published in English, Spanish and Portuguese. The results 
will be presented in tables, narrative summaries and graphs and will be graded 
on the type of data presented and the results. The search strategy will be 
updated in April 2023. The expected completion date of this ScR is July 2023.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This ScR protocol does not require ethical approval. 
Dissemination plans include peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations 
to be shared with experts in the field, and advisory groups to inform 
discussions on future research. It is hoped that our findings will be of 
interest to practitioners, researchers, stakeholders, public and private 
managers, and the general population concerned with this emerging public health 
issue.

PURPOSE: Economic evaluations of health technologies traditionally aim to 
maximize population health outcomes measured by using quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Non-health outcomes, however, may have high social value, 
and their exclusion has the potential to bias decisions regarding allocation of 
health care resources. This research positions Australian participants as 
societal decision-makers to explore their willingness to trade-off health gains 
in adults for non-health benefits in families with a child affected by a rare 
disease.
METHODS: To estimate the social value of the different health care 
interventions, a person trade-off (PTO) method was used. PTOs present 
participants with groups of beneficiaries that vary in terms of the number of 
individuals who will benefit, the individuals' characteristics, their expected 
benefits, or a combination, and ask which group should be prioritized. Each 
trade-off presented health gains from the treatment of moderate physical and 
mental health conditions described by the 3-level version of the EuroQol 
5-Dimension (EQ-5D-3L) health states. The health gains in these groups were 
traded-off against non-health gains in families accessing diagnostic genomic 
testing, and equivalence values were calculated, using median and ratio of means 
methods, based on the ratio of the group sizes at the point of equivalence. 
Participants were recruited through Prolific and were stratified according to 
age, sex, and education. The impact of participant characteristics on 
equivalence values was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis H tests and ordinary 
least-squares log-linear regressions.
FINDINGS: Participants (N = 434) positioned as societal decision-makers were 
generally willing to trade-off adult health gains with the familial non-health 
benefits of genomic testing, showing a preference for valuing both types of 
outcomes within public health policy. The aggregation of preferences generated 2 
weightings for genomic testing against each health treatment, an unadjusted 
value and a reweighted value to match target demographic characteristics. 
Converted into QALY value per test, it was found that participants valued the 
non-health benefits of genomic testing between 0.730 and 0.756 QALY. A minority 
of participants always prioritized diagnostic genomic testing over the physical 
(6.0%) or mental (4.6%) health treatments, with a larger minority always 
prioritizing the physical (15.4%) or mental (14.8%) health treatments.
IMPLICATIONS: The findings indicate that participants perceived the non-health 
parental benefits in children experiencing rare disease to have comparable value 
to health gains in adults experiencing the moderate physical or mental health 
conditions described using EQ-5D-3L. These findings suggest that the benefits of 
genomic tests would be underestimated if only health benefits are included in 
economic evaluations.

OBJECTIVES: How patients value functional outcomes against oncologic outcomes 
during decision-making for muscular-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) remains 
unclear. We sought to quantify individuals' preferences on a scale of 0 to 1, 
where 1 represents perfect health and 0 represents death.
METHODS: Descriptions of 6 hypothetical health states were developed. These 
included: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy with ileal 
conduit (IC) or with neobladder reconstruction (NB), Transurethral resection and 
chemotherapy/radiation (CRT), CRT requiring salvage cystectomy (SC), 
Recurrent/metastatic bladder cancer after local therapy (RMBC), and Metastatic 
bladder cancer (MBC). Descriptions consisted of diagnosis, treatments, adverse 
effects, follow-up protocol, and prognosis and were reviewed for accuracy by 
expert panel. Included individuals were asked to evaluate states using the 
visual analog scale (VAS) and standard gamble (SG) methods.
RESULTS: Fifty-four individuals were included for analysis. No score differences 
were observed between IC, NB, and CRT on VAS or SG. On VAS, SC (value = 0.429) 
was rated as significantly worse (P < 0.001) than NB (value = 0.582) and CRT 
(value = 0.565). However, this was not the case using the SG method. Both RMBC 
(VAS value = 0.178, SG value = 0.631) and MBC (VAS value = 0.169, SG 
value = 0.327) rated as significantly worse (P < 0.001) than the other states 
using both VAS and SG.
CONCLUSIONS: Within this sample of the general population, preferences for local 
treatments including IC, NB, and CRT were not found to be significantly 
different. These values can be used to calculate quality-adjusted life 
expectancy in future cost-effectiveness analyses.

PURPOSE: The credible data about the burden of early-onset colorectal cancer 
(EOCRC) in China when compared to other countries in the group of twenty (G20) 
remained unavailable. We aimed to assess the burden and trends of EOCRC and 
attributable risk factors in China. Meanwhile, the comparison in the burden and 
attributable risk factors between China and other G20 countries was also 
evaluated.
METHODS: Data on the incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), and attributable risk factors of EOCRC in China were obtained 
from Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 and 
compared with other G20countries. Temporal trends of age-standardized rates for 
incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs were evaluated by estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC). The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) 
model was used to forecast the incidence, mortality, and DALY rates of EOCRC in 
China from 2020 to 2029.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and 
age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) of EOCRC in China increased with the 
EAPCs of 4.61 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.45-4.77] and 5.82 (95% CI: 
5.60-6.05). When compared to G20 countries, China was ranked 13th in the ASIR in 
1990 and then increased to 2nd in 2019, second only to Japan. The ASPRs 
increased in all G20 countries, being highest in Saudi Arabia, followed by China 
and Mexico. Moreover, China had the highest age-standardized mortality rate and 
highest age-standardized DALY rate in 2019. In China, the five leading risk 
factors, for both sexes, were diet low in milk [18.54% (95% UI: 12.71-24.07)], 
diet low in calcium [15.06% (95% UI: 10.70-20.03)], alcohol use [12.16% (95% UI: 
8.87-15.64)], smoking [9.08% (95% UI: 3.39-14.11)], and diet high in red meat 
[9.08% (95% UI: 3.39-14.11)] in 2019. Over the next 10 years, ASIR, ASMR, and 
age-standardized DALY rate of EOCRC will increase continuously in males and 
females.
CONCLUSION: The burden of EOCRC in China and other G20 countries is worrisome, 
indicating that coordinated efforts are needed to conduct high-quality 
researches, allocate medical resources, adjust screening guidelines, and develop 
effective treatment and prevention strategies in the G20 countries.

Aficamten is a novel cardiac myosin inhibitor that has demonstrated its ability 
to safely lower left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients and improve 
heart failure symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM). Based on the REDWOOD-HCM open label extension (OLE) study, participants 
receiving aficamten had significantly reduced resting and Valsalva LVOT gradient 
within 2 weeks after initiating treatment, with ongoing improvements over 24 
weeks, and recent evidence suggests effects can sustain up to 48 weeks. While 
beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and disopyramide have shown some
