The well-known Watson-Crick complementarity rules, which were discovered 50 
years ago, elegantly direct the specific pairing of two DNA single strands. On 
the contrary, once formed, the double-stranded (ds) DNA lacks such a simple and 
sequence-universal recognition principle, since most of the characteristic 
chemical groups of nucleobases are now buried deep inside the double helix, the 
major DNA form. We report a promising versatile approach for highly selective 
recognition of designated sites within dsDNA featuring considerable practical 
potential for a variety of molecular-biological, biotechnological, 
gene-therapeutic, and diagnostic applications. It may also have implications for 
prebiotic evolution of genetic machinery at the primordial stages of the origin 
of life. Our design synergistically employs the robust helix-invasion ability of 
recently developed DNA mimics and analogs, pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic 
acids and pseudocomplementary oligonucleotides, thus enabling the 
sequence-unrestricted recognition of chosen DNA duplexes by nucleobase 
oligomers. Using this basically general approach, we selectively tagged a unique 
mixed-base site on the target dsDNA fragment with streptavidin and/or multiply 
labeled this site with fluorophores via the primer-extension reaction.

INTRODUCTION: The number of patients of advanced age with symptomatic coronary 
illness that need surgical or percutaneous revascularisation is increasing. The 
aim of the present paper is to gain knowledge of the evolution of patients over 
70 years of age subjected to myocardial revascularisation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We compare two groups of patients, in a non-aleatory 
manner, subjected to angioplasty (N=65) and to surgery (N=75). The average age 
was 74.12 +/- 3.5 (70-85) and 71.97 +/- 1.9 (70-79) years respectively. The 
number of unhealthy vessels was greater in the surgical group (1.84 +/- 0.8 vs 
2.65 +/- 0.8).
RESULTS: The number revascularised vessels is greater and revascularisation more 
complete in the surgical group (1.14 +/- 0.4 vs 2.59 +/- 0.9) and (76% vs 49%). 
There is no difference in mortality in both groups. The functional degree during 
the evolution is worse for the angioplasty group and besides more antianginous 
medicines are used in treatment (1.92 +/- 1.2 vs 1.26 +/- 0.8) and they are 
subjected more frequently to a new revascularisation.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the sick rate and the mortality of the procedure was similar 
in both groups. Both procedures are valid therapeutic alternatives and are 
acceptably safe with these patients. Surgery is more complete and is carried out 
on a group of patients with greater coronary distress. There are no differences 
in life expectancy amongst the patients treated with either of the techniques. 
During the follow-up period the functional degree of the surgical group is 
better and there are more patients treated with monotherapy.

In analogy to the famous saying that war is too serious to leave it to the 
generals, one could say that the provision of medical care is too serious and 
too costly to leave it to doctors. This, however.would give the impression of an 
incongruity which does not exist as an actual factor or as a standpoint in 
research on the healthcare system. Having said that, there are differences in 
the methods of observation used: doctors always base their observations on their 
experiences at the doctor/patient level. In these situations, they are 
influenced by the therapeutic imperative of wanting to help and their 
convictions do not allow them to take into account competing requirements or to 
feel dependent on the higher-level conditions; and the realm of research on the 
health care system bases its observations more or less on findings derived by 
means of analysing what is often highly aggregated data, be it of a medical, 
economic or epidemiological nature. Even though the insights gained at the 
macrolevel ultimately have to be applied at the microlevel of the doctor/patient 
relationship, there remains an internal distance from the problems of care which 
is conducive to proper judgement. From this distant vantage point, researchers 
attempt to prove the relationship between effort and yield, to indicate weak 
spots which individual doctors cannot recognise and to define capacity, 
structure and incentive conditions which guarantee maxi-mum medical care 
quality. There is, for instance, evidence of astonishing dependence between the 
medical care provided and incentives for the number of doctor/patient contacts, 
use of medicines, surgery rates and number of diagnoses. This evidence can be 
used to draw up recommendations for self-governing bodies in the health care 
sector and for the political sphere as to how the health care system could be 
enhanced to achieve a high level of efficiency and quality.

Assessment of health economics in Alzheimer's disease (AHEAD): treatment with 
galantamine in the UK.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term health and economic impact of treating mild 
to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) with galantamine (16 mg or 24 mg per day) 
compared to no cholinesterase therapy in the UK.
METHODS: The long-term costs and outcomes were assessed using a model developed 
from longitudinal data on a cohort of AD patients. The model predicts the time 
until patients require full-time care, defined as the consistent requirement for 
a significant amount of care and supervision each day. Efficacy data were 
obtained from three clinical trials comparing galantamine with placebo, 
forecasts were made for ten years. Costs were determined in 2001 British pounds 
and discounted at 6% per annum, while outcomes such as time to full-time care 
were discounted at 1.5%.
RESULTS: Without pharmacological treatment, patients are expected to incur costs 
of 28,134 British pounds over ten years, 70% of costs accrue from providing 
full-time care. Galantamine (16 mg per day) is predicted to reduce the duration 
of the full-time care state by 12%; approximately five patients need to be 
treated to avoid one year of full-time care. The ten-year incremental costs per 
month of full-time care avoided average pound 192 British pounds per patient and 
8,693 British pounds per QALY. Savings (1380 British pounds) are predicted for 
patients who continue treatment beyond six months and whose cognitive function 
is maintained or improved. Comparable results were estimated for the 24 mg dose.
CONCLUSION: In addition to the clinical benefits associated with galantamine 
treatment, the savings predicted from delaying when full-time care is needed may 
offset the treatment costs.

This paper presents a combined surgical-prosthetic procedure of reconstructing 
mandibular bone defect in a 53 year old patient, following enucleation of a 
mandibular cyst (Cystectomy Partsch II). After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, 
a surgical procedure was planned with the particular attention to the nature of 
the disease, patient's condition, size and extension of the cyst, tissue loss, 
and the possibilities of prosthetic management of a mandibular bone defect with 
partial postresection dental prosthesis. It is of great importance to point to 
the significance of teamwork of a maxillofacial surgeon and a specialist in 
prosthodontics. This kind of cooperation provided very effective and less risky 
soft tissue, as well as bone tissue regeneration (osteogenesis). The patient's 
recovery was fast, and he could return to his daily activities and work without 
significant changes regarding quality of life after surgery and prosthetic 
treatment.

Erectile dysfunction affects 150 millions of men and its prevalence increases 
with age. The improvement of life expectancy will increase the worldwide 
prevalence to 300 million in 2025. Oral treatments are nowadays the first line 
therapy for the vast majority of people as they have a good reliability and 
tolerance and restore more spontaneity. The authors relate the widespread 
interest in phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors with the advent of sildenafil 
for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and present characteristics of 2 new 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in Belgium, tadalafil and vardenafil.

Solitary cardiac metastasis is rarely recognized. We report a case of solitary 
cardiac metastasis from a rectal adenocarcinoma that was manifested as superior 
vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Invasion of the deep cardiac structures was so severe 
that only its palliative resection and right atrial reconstruction were 
performed using a cardiopulmonary bypass to release the SVC obstruction. The 
postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home without 
any complications. Adjuvant chemotherapy could not be performed because of the 
renal dysfunction. Eleven months later, the patient died from multiple 
metastasis of adenocarcinoma. Even though the surgery was not curative, it might 
be effective for release from symptoms and for elongating life expectancy.

UK Back pain Exercise And Manipulation (UK BEAM) trial--national randomised 
trial of physical treatments for back pain in primary care: objectives, design

BACKGROUND: Low back pain has major health and social implications. Although 
there have been many randomised controlled trials of manipulation and exercise 
for the management of low back pain, the role of these two treatments in its 
routine management remains unclear. A previous trial comparing private 
chiropractic treatment with National Health Service (NHS) outpatient treatment, 
which found a benefit from chiropractic treatment, has been criticised because 
it did not take treatment location into account. There are data to suggest that 
general exercise programmes may have beneficial effects on low back pain. The UK 
Medical Research Council (MRC) has funded this major trial of physical 
treatments for back pain, based in primary care. It aims to establish if, when 
added to best care in general practice, a defined package of spinal manipulation 
and a defined programme of exercise classes (Back to Fitness) improve 
participant-assessed outcomes. Additionally the trial compares outcomes between 
participants receiving the spinal manipulation in NHS premises and in private 
premises.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial using a 3 x 2 factorial design.
METHODS: We sought to randomise 1350 participants with simple low back pain of 
at least one month's duration. These came from 14 locations across the UK, each 
with a cluster of 10-15 general practices that were members of the MRC General 
Practice Research Framework (GPRF). All practices were trained in the active 
management of low back pain. Participants were randomised to this form of 
general practice care only, or this general practice care plus manipulation, or 
this general practice care plus exercise, or this general practice care plus 
manipulation followed by exercise. Those randomised to manipulation were further 
randomised to receive treatment in either NHS or private premises. Follow up was 
by postal questionnaire one, three and 12 months after randomisation. The 
primary analysis will consider the main treatment effects before interactions 
between the two treatment packages. Economic analysis will estimate the cost per 
unit of health utility gained by adding either or both of the treatment packages 
to general practice care.

BACKGROUND: Estimates of the disease burden due to multiple risk factors can 
show the potential gain from combined preventive measures. But few such 
investigations have been attempted, and none on a global scale. Our aim was to 
estimate the potential health benefits from removal of multiple major risk 
factors.
METHODS: We assessed the burden of disease and injury attributable to the joint 
effects of 20 selected leading risk factors in 14 epidemiological subregions of 
the world. We estimated population attributable fractions, defined as the 
proportional reduction in disease or mortality that would occur if exposure to a 
risk factor were reduced to an alternative level, from data for risk factor 
prevalence and hazard size. For every disease, we estimated joint population 
attributable fractions, for multiple risk factors, by age and sex, from the 
direct contributions of individual risk factors. To obtain the direct hazards, 
we reviewed publications and re-analysed cohort data to account for that part of 
hazard that is mediated through other risks.
RESULTS: Globally, an estimated 47% of premature deaths and 39% of total disease 
burden in 2000 resulted from the joint effects of the risk factors considered. 
These risks caused a substantial proportion of important diseases, including 
diarrhoea (92%-94%), lower respiratory infections (55-62%), lung cancer (72%), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60%), ischaemic heart disease (83-89%), 
and stroke (70-76%). Removal of these risks would have increased global healthy 
life expectancy by 9.3 years (17%) ranging from 4.4 years (6%) in the developed 
countries of the western Pacific to 16.1 years (43%) in parts of sub-Saharan 
Africa.
INTERPRETATION: Removal of major risk factors would not only increase healthy 
life expectancy in every region, but also reduce some of the differences between 
regions. The potential for disease prevention and health gain from tackling 
major known risks simultaneously would be substantial.

PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease. We compared the clinical effects of treating 
dyslipidemia in patients who had diabetes mellitus but no diagnosed 
cardiovascular disease with the effects of similar treatment in patients who had 
cardiovascular disease but no diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: We estimated the number of adults (ages 30 to 74 years) requiring lipid 
therapy using data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey and current lipid treatment guidelines. Using the Cardiovascular Life 
Expectancy Model, we estimated the mean increase in life expectancy that would 
result from lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 35% and 
increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 8% based on results 
from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study.
RESULTS: The mean number of years of life saved ranged from 3 to 3.4 years for 
men with diabetes versus 2.4 to 2.7 years for men with cardiovascular disease. 
In women, the estimated benefits were 1.6 to 2.4 years for those with diabetes 
versus 1.6 to 2.1 years for those with cardiovascular disease. Total population 
benefits were also substantial for patients with diabetes (25.4 million 
person-years of life saved) and those with cardiovascular disease (16.0 million 
person-years of life saved).
CONCLUSION: The clinical benefits of treating dyslipidemia in patients with 
diabetes should be at least equivalent to, if not more substantial than, the 
benefits observed among those with cardiovascular disease.

Cryosurgery for prostate cancer.

Fahmy WE(1), Bissada NK.

Author information:
(1)Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.

Choice of management for patients with prostate cancer is influenced by patient 
and disease characteristics and life expectancy. Management options include 
expectance (watchful waiting), radical prostatectomy, external beam 
radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and cryosurgical ablation of the prostate (CSAP). 
The role of cryotherapy in the management of prostate cancer is still evolving. 
Continued research has allowed the introduction of efficient and safe 
cryosurgical equipment exemplified by the current third-generation cryosurgical 
machines. CSAP can be performed in an ambulatory surgery setting or as inpatient 
surgery with overnight stay. The procedure is performed under continuous 
ultrasonic monitoring. Mature data from the use of second-generation 
cryosurgical equipment indicate that CSAP is an effective therapeutic modality 
for managing patients with prostate cancer. Current data with the 
third-generation cryosurgical equipment are not mature. However, the favorable 
side effect profile and the good early responses seem to indicate that this 
modality will have a prominent role in the management of patients with prostate 
cancer.

MD, USA. emessias@jhsph.edu

OBJECTIVES: The link between income disparities and health has been studied 
mostly in developed nations. This study assesses the relationship between income 
disparities and life expectancy in Brazil and measures the impact of illiteracy 
rates on the association.
METHODS: The units of analysis (n = 27) are all the Brazilian states and the 
federal capital. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed to 
measure the association between income disparity, measured by the Gini 
coefficient, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and illiteracy rate. Data 
came from publicly available sources at the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.
RESULTS: Income disparities and illiteracy rates were negatively associated with 
life expectancy in Brazil. GDP per capita was positively associated with life 
expectancy. The inclusion of illiteracy rates in the regression model removed 
the effect of income disparities.
CONCLUSIONS: Illiteracy rate is strongly associated with life expectancy in 
Brazil. This finding is in accord with reports from the United States and has 
implications for health policy and planning for both developed and developing 
countries.

Cost-effectiveness of ultrasound in preventing femoral venous 
catheter-associated pulmonary embolism.

Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. christopher.cox@duke.edu

Femoral central venous catheter use is complicated by a high risk of deep venous 
thrombosis despite antithrombotic prophylaxis. Although some have recommended 
screening for femoral catheter-associated thrombosis to prevent pulmonary 
embolism (PE), this strategy's economic implications are unclear. Therefore, we 
used a decision model to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a Doppler 
ultrasound-based screening strategy versus no ultrasound in averting 
thromboembolic complications associated with femoral catheters. The base-case 
analysis included a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old medical patients treated 
for acute respiratory failure. The perspective was that of the health care 
payor, and the primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life expectancy, PE, and 
PE-associated deaths. The ultrasound strategy cost $8,688/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained, $5,305/PE averted, and $99,286/PE death averted. The 
best- and worst-case scenarios, calculated in multiway sensitivity analyses by 
varying in-hospital mortality, deep venous thrombosis prevalence, and ultrasound 
accuracy, ranged from $1,170/QALY to $35,342/QALY, respectively. Probablistic 
analyses, in which variables with uncertain values were varied randomly within 
their ranges, demonstrated median costs of $12,793/QALY (interquartile range 
$8,176/QALY, $20,648/QALY). In summary, ultrasound screening may improve 
outcomes among the critically ill with femoral venous catheters at acceptable 
costs and could complement venous thrombosis primary prevention programs.

Coronary heart disease risk in people 65 years of age and older.

Levine BS(1), Kannel W.

of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA. bslev@comcast.net

Evidence from epidemiologic studies indicates that the same factors that are 
associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in middle-aged 
people are relevant in older adults (i.e., those aged >or=65). The relative risk 
associated with some risk factors decreases with advancing age but this is 
offset by greater incidence of CHD among older adults. A growing body of 
evidence from clinical trials indicates that risk factor modification in older 
adults reduces CHD risk as effectively as it does in middle-aged adults. 
Multivariable risk assessment can be used to effectively target intervention to 
those at significant risk for an initial CHD event and to avoid over-treatment. 
It is important to appreciate that the average remaining life expectancy after 
achieving 80 years is about 8 years.

OBJECTIVE: To identify clinically useful parameters obtainable before treatment 
of predicting clinical outcomes in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Various factors regarding the biologic state of tumors 
or the nutritional state of patients have been individually reported to 
correlate with prognosis. Reliable estimates of life expectancy before treatment 
are important, and consideration needs to be given not only to tumor-related but 
also to host-related factors in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
METHODS: The following clinicopathological factors were retrospectively analyzed 
in 356 consecutive patients with surgical treatment: sex; age; serum C-reactive 
protein (CRP); proportion of lymphocytes; body weight changes; serum albumin; 
clinical TNM staging; tumor location; serum squamous cell-related antigen; serum 
carcinoembryonic antigen; and histology. Factors related to prognosis were 
evaluated by using univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: According to univariate analysis, significant differences in survival 
were found for sex, serum CRP, proportion of lymphocytes, body weight change, 
serum albumin, serum squamous cell-related antigen, and clinical TNM staging. 
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CRP levels (P = 0.0285), body weight 
change (P = 0.0165), and clinical TNM staging (P = 0.0008) displayed independent 
correlations to prognosis. When serum CRP elevation, body weight loss, and 
clinical TNM staging III and IV were scored as a combined index, the total score 
(prognostic index for esophageal cancer, PIEC) demonstrated a good 
stratification value for prognosis. Moreover, PIEC was superior to the 
conventional clinical TNM staging by the likelihood ratio test.
CONCLUSIONS: PIEC based on serum CRP, body weight change, and clinical TNM 
staging before treatment offers a very simple and informative method for 
predicting the prognosis of patients with esophageal carcinoma.

Cancer mortality among American Indians and Alaska Natives--United States, 
1994-1998.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In the United States, public health interventions to control infectious 
diseases, lower infant and maternal mortality, and improve basic sanitation have 
led to a substantial increase in life expectancy for American Indians and Alaska 
Natives (AI/ANs). During 1940-1995, average life expectancy among AI/ANs 
increased 39%, from 51 years in 1940 to 71 years in 1995; however, AI/ANs 
experienced a parallel increase in mortality rates for chronic diseases, 
including cancer, which is the second leading cause of death for AI/ANs 
nationally and the leading cause of death among Alaska Natives. A previous study 
examining cancer mortality rates during 1989-1993 documented lower cancer 
mortality rates for AI/ANs than for the overall U.S. population, with regional 
variation. To understand cancer mortality among AI/ANs subsequent to that 
period, the Indian Health Service (IHS) and CDC analyzed death certificate data 
provided by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics for deaths among AI/ANs 
in five U.S. geographic regions during 1994-1998. This report summarizes the 
results of that analysis, which indicate that cancer mortality rates among 
AI/ANs nationally were lower than cancer mortality rates for all U.S. 
racial/ethnic populations combined. Rates for AI/ANs varied by region, with the 
highest rates found in the Alaska and the Northern Plains regions. Plans or 
modifications for cancer prevention and treatment programs should account for 
regional variation, and programs to discourage smoking initiation, encourage 
tobacco cessation, and promote colorectal cancer screening among AI/ANs in the 
Alaska and the Northern Plains regions should be expanded.

Repair of chronic spinal cord injury.

Science, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA. houlejohnd@uams.edu

Advances in medical and rehabilitative care now allow the 10-12,000 individuals 
who suffer spinal cord injuries each year in the United States to lead 
productive lives of nearly normal life expectancy, so that the numbers of those 
with chronic injuries will approximate 300,000 at the end of the next decade. 
This signals an urgent need for new treatments that will improve repair and 
recovery after longstanding injuries. In the present report we consider the 
characteristics of the chronically injured spinal cord that make it an even more 
challenging setting in which to elicit regeneration than the acutely injured 
spinal cord and review the treatments that have been designed to enhance axon 
growth. When applied in the first 2 weeks after experimental spinal cord injury, 
transplants, usually in combination with supplementary neurotrophic factors, and 
possibly modifications of the inhibitory central nervous system environment, 
have produced limited long-distance axon regeneration and behavioral recovery. 
When applied to injuries older than 4 weeks, the same treatments have almost 
invariably failed to overcome the obstacles posed by the neurons' diminished 
capacity for regeneration and by the increasing hostility to growth of the 
terrain at and beyond the injury site. Novel treatments that have stimulated 
regeneration after acute injuries have not yet been applied to chronic injuries. 
A therapeutic strategy that combines rehabilitation training and pharmacological 
modulation of neurotransmitters appears to be a particularly promising approach 
to increasing recovery after longstanding injury. Identifying patients with no 
hope of useful recovery in the early days after injury will allow these 
treatments to be administered as early as possible.

Predictors of postmenopausal body mass index and waist hip ratio in the oklahoma 
postmenopausal health disparities study.

Pharmacy, 1014 Salk Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. gavaler@pitt.edu

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the current study has been to examine systematically the 
respective roles of nutrition, exercise, menopausal weight gain, moderate 
drinking and smoking as determinants of body mass index (BMI) and waist hip 
ratio (WHR) in a setting in which the role of race or ethnic group could be 
simultaneously or individually evaluated as predictors of BMI and WHR. Because 
the use of estrogen replacement has been reported to affect estimates of body 
fat mass in postmenopausal women, endocrine factors have also been evaluated.
METHODS: The design is cross-sectional with historical prospective elements. The 
study has a biomedical focus and is not an epidemiologic study. Data are from 
649 women recruited into The Postmenopausal Health Disparities Study in 
Oklahoma. The study population was composed of 649 postmenopausal women: 
American Indian: 226 (34.9%), Asian: 21 (3.2%), Black: 78 (12.0%), Hispanics: 54 
(8.3%) and Whites: 270 (41.6%). Recruitment occurred between 1994 and late 1999 
in Oklahoma.
RESULTS: In this multi-racial, multi-ethnic study population, there was 
statistical heterogeneity in all nutrition/dietary and exercise variables as 
well as in other potential determinants of BMI and WHR. In contrast to the 
literature available for postmenopausal women in which postmenopausal status, 
estrogen replacement and race have rarely been taken into account, the results 
of multi-linear regression revealed the following: Significant predictors for 
BMI, with or without WHR specified, included the neuroendocrine factors, 
menopausal weight gain, smoking, mean fitness (i.e., difficulty performing 
physical activities), fat as percent of total calories, moderate drinking and 
being Asian or Black. When WHR was not included, total calories and 
socioeconomic status also entered the model. The statistical predictors of WHR 
in the total study population with BMI in the equation included BMI and the 
neuroendocrine variables of FSH, E2, but not ERT, as well as the interaction of 
higher intensity exercise fitness with frequency, socioeconomic status and being 
American Indian or Asian. When BMI was not included in the model, in addition to 
the neuroendocrine factors, the interaction of lower intensity exercise fitness 
with frequency, fat as percent of total calories, age living alone and being 
American Indian or and Black were significant predictors of WHR. The predictors 
of both BMI and WHR were found to differ among individual racial and ethnic 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the role of increased body fat and obesity in disease risk 
and the substantial differences in life expectancy among the racial and ethnic 
groups, the findings of this study, particularly in contrast to literature 
reports, strongly suggest that a whole variety of factors including hormonal 
status and race need to be considered when examining the role of dietary factors 
and physical activity in relation to estimates of body fat mass and disease 
risk.

In this paper it is argued that the separation of elements associated with the 
time spent by the patient is not conducted in a consistent way. This is the case 
for income (for which there at least has been some attention) and for other time 
elements like lost unpaid work, leisure and role-functioning. The use of general 
rather than specific preferences in health state assessments makes the 
separation of time-elements into costs and effects difficult. While costs are 
calculated specifically for the patient group under study, effects are normally 
derived from preferences in the general public. The characteristics of these two 
groups in terms of (the opportunity of) spending time on activities need not 
coincide. The use of specific time-group valuations of health states may be a 
good alternative to using general health state valuations.

Institute, Norrbacka, Stockholm, Sweden. Kristina.Burstrom@smd.sll.se

The study aimed to estimate the value of the change in health in Sweden 1980/81 
to 1996/97. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for men and women at specific 
ages were estimated for 1980/81, 1988/89 and 1996/97, by combining survival 
rates and health state scores. Data from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions 
(n = 39,966) were used to estimate age-specific health state scores. Responses 
to selected survey questions were mapped into the EQ-5D measure, using the UK 
EQ-5D index tariff to derive health state scores. The monetary value of a QALY 
was assumed to be 100,000 dollars. Life expectancy for infants increased by 3.68 
years for males and 2.70 years for females between 1980/81 and 1996/97. Average 
health status decreased in younger age groups whereas it increased in older age 
groups. Expected QALYs for infants increased by 2.64 for males and 0.54 for 
females. With 3% discounting the gain was 0.11 QALYs (11,000 dollars) among 
males and a loss by 0.58 QALYs (58,000 dollars) among females. The corresponding 
gain in discounted QALYs for a 75-year-old was 1.15 (115,000 dollars) and 0.80 
(80,000 dollars), respectively. It is concluded that older persons have 
experienced considerable health gains whereas the health gains have been small 
or non-existent for younger women.

Methodological issues raised by preference-based approaches to measuring the 
health status of children.

University of Oxford, Headington, Oxford, UK. stavros.petrou@perinat.ox.ac.uk

This paper identifies and discusses a number of methodological issues that 
require consideration when applying preference-based approaches to the 
measurement of the health status of children. It is argued that the decision 
about which dimensions of health status to incorporate into health state 
descriptions or classifications should depend, in part, upon whether the measure 
will be used to inform resource allocation within or across age groups. In 
addition, the paper identifies and discusses a number of methodological issues 
surrounding the appropriate respondents for descriptions and valuations of 
health status in different contexts; potential sources of bias in the 
description and valuation processes; and the psychometric integrity of 
alternative measurement approaches.

Dose-response effects of fluorouracil, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cisplatin, 
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and etoposide on VEGF165/164-mediated 
angiogenesis using the rat mesenteric-window angiogenesis assay are reported. 
VEGF is a pivotal pro-angiogenic factor in most tumors. Microvessel spatial 
extension, density, pattern formation and segment length were assessed 
quantitatively and objectively. A single i.v. injection of each drug was given 
at a low, intermediate or high dose, 7 days before sacrifice. All the drugs 
elicited significant responses in terms of one or more measured variables. Only 
paclitaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide significantly suppressed the 
overall angiogenic response (p < or = 0.0001, p < or = 0.0002 and p < or = 0.05, 
respectively), however. Taking toxicity into account, paclitaxel was more potent 
in inhibition of angiogenesis than the other agents. No clear correlation was 
found between drug half-life, the degree of toxic effects (in terms ofbody 
weight changes) and the antiangiogenic effect. The antiangiogenic effects were 
distinctly drug specific.

No improvement in the overall survival of 194 patients with chondrosarcoma in 
Finland in 1971-1990.

We describe the clinicopathologic profile and survival of 306 patients with 
chondrosarcoma reported to the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1971-1990. 218 cases 
were available for reevaluation. Owing to their various clinicopathologic 
characteristics, we excluded the histologic variants of chondrosarcoma. 
Therefore, the final study population included 194 patients. The minimum 
follow-up was 9 years. The study population included 69 grade 1 tumors, 114 
grade 2 tumors, and 11 grade 3 tumors. The commonest tumor sites were the chest, 
pelvis and femur. A local recurrence developed in 25% of the patients and 
metastatic lesions in 18%. The patients were treated in 31 hospitals (in 22 
hospitals during the 1970s and in 26 in the 1980s), and the number of patients 
biopsied before the referral remained about the same from the 1970s (15%) to the 
1980s (18%). The 5-and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were 70% and 57%, 
respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the most important independent 
predictors of shortened survival were high histologic grade, age 50 years or 
older, and a diagnosis in the 1980s, as compared to the 1970s. Most findings 
accorded with reports from specialist treatment centers, but to our surprise, 
the survival rate declined among patients diagnosed in the 1980s versus the 
1970s. The failure to improve patient survival is probably due to treatment of 
the patients in 31 hospitals rather than in a few centers dealing with treatment 
of cancer.

3 Nordic cohorts of total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in 
patients operated on for primary osteoarthrosis during 1967-1995 were partly 
adapted and combined for meta-analysis. THA was performed in 49,000 patients and 
TKA in 24,000 totaling 497,000 person years. The mean and maximum follow-up 
times were 6.8 and 30 years, respectively. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) 
with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the observed and 
expected number of cancers. The expected numbers were based on national 
incidence rates. The overall SIRs as well as the site-specific ones were similar 
in the THA and TKA patients. The observed number of cancers at all sites was 
7,639 and the expected one was 8,202 (SIR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95). The SIRs for 
lung cancer (0.69, 0.64-0.75) and laryngeal cancer (0.64, 0.44-0.92) were 
reduced. The incidence was also low for cancers of the stomach (SIR 0.76, 
0.67-0.84), colon (SIR 0.86, 0.79-0.93) and rectum (SIR 0.89, 0.80-0.98). Among 
TKA patients, the only increases in SIRs were seen in cancers of the endometrium 
(SIR 1.36, 1.05-1.74), prostate (SIR 1.19, 1.02-1.38) and, among both THA and 
TKA patients, in skin melanoma (combined SIR 1.21, 1.03-1.41).

Sciences, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.

Primary human cells have a definite life span and enter into cellular senescence 
before ceasing cell growth. Oxidative stress produced by aerobic metabolism has 
been shown to accelerate cellular senescence. Here, we demonstrated that 
ascorbic acid, used as an antioxygenic reagent, delayed cellular senescence in a 
continuous culture of normal human embryonic cells, human adult skin fibroblast 
cells, and Werner syndrome (WS) cells. The results using human embryonic cells 
showed that treatment with ascorbic acid phospholic ester magnesium salt (APM) 
decreased the level of oxidative stress, and extended the replicative life span. 
The effect of APM to extend the replicative life span was also shown in normal 
human adult cells and WS cells. To understand the mechanism of extension of 
cellular life span, we determined the telomere lengths of human embryonic cells, 
both with and without APM treatment, and demonstrated that APM treatment reduced 
the rate of telomere shortening. The present results indicate that constitutive 
oxidative stress plays a role in determining the replicative life span and that 
suppression of oxidative stress by an antioxidative agent, APM, extends the 
replicative life span by reducing the rate of telomere shortening.

BACKGROUND: The short-term outcome of kidney transplantation in patients with 
amyloidosis has been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate long-term 
results in patients with renal amyloidosis.
METHODS: We studied results of renal transplantation in 23 amyloidotic 
transplant recipients compared with those in a control group of 47 
nonamyloidotic patients. Amyloidosis was secondary to familial Mediterranean 
fever (FMF) in 16 patients, whereas it was primary (idiopathic) in 7 transplant 
recipients. The 2 groups were homogeneous regarding age, sex, HLA matching, 
immunosuppression, and duration of transplantation.
RESULTS: Five- and 10-year actuarial graft survival rates were similar in both 
groups (79.35% versus 84.04% and 65.92% versus 56.61%, respectively ). Five- and 
10-year actuarial patient survival rates also were similar (80% versus 94% and 
68% versus 87%, respectively). Moreover, 72.4% of controls experienced at least 
1 rejection episode, whereas only 43.5% of amyloidotic transplant recipients 
experienced 1 or more such events (P = 0.02). Nonetheless, mean serum creatinine 
concentrations did not differ between the 2 groups during the observation 
period. Maintenance colchicine therapy prevented the recurrence of both FMF 
symptoms and amyloidosis. Recurrence was documented in only 1 amyloidotic 
transplant recipient (4.3%) 10 years posttransplantation. Significant 
gastrointestinal (GI) problems were more frequent in amyloidotic patients (65% 
versus 38%; P = 0.03). Amyloidotic patients with GI problems, except for 2 
patients, were administered cyclosporine. Eleven of these patients had FMF, 
which appeared to reflect the effects of both cyclosporine and colchicine. 
Infections were similar in the groups; whereas amyloidotic patients had 
significantly lower blood pressures.
CONCLUSION: In our experience, long-term (5 to 10 years) outcome of live related 
donor kidney transplantation in patients with amyloidosis is similar to that in 
the general transplant population.
