Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs) are rare tumors, but their 
incidental diagnosis has significantly increased due to the widespread use of 
imaging studies. Therefore, most PanNENs are now diagnosed when completely 
asymptomatic and in early stages. PanNENs are classified according to their 
grade (Ki-67 index) and can be functional (F-) or nonfunctional (NF-) depending 
on the presence or absence of a clinical, hormonal hypersecretion syndrome. The 
mainstay treatment of PanNENs is a surgery that is mostly curative but also 
associated with significant short- and long-term adverse events. Therefore, less 
invasive alternative locoregional treatment modalities are warranted. Recently, 
few case reports and two case series have described EUS-guided radiofrequency 
ablation (EUS-RFA) for the treatment of patients with both F-PanNENs and 
NF-PanNENs. If for F-PanNENs EUS-RFA can very easily become the standard of 
care, for NF-PanNENEs it is still controversial how to select patients for 
EUS-RFA. A balance between overtreatment (i.e., RFA/surgery in patients who will 
not progress) and undertreatment (locoregional treatments in patients with 
undetected metastases) needs to be found based on solid data. The decision 
should also take into account patients' comorbidity and risk of postoperative 
death, life expectancy, tumor location, risk of postoperative fistula and 
postoperative morbidity, and risk of long-term exocrine and/or endocrine 
insufficiency. To answer the important question on which a patient should be 
treated with EUS-RFA, properly designed studies to evaluate the efficacy of this 
treatment in large cohorts of patients with NF-PanNENs and to establish 
prognostic factors associated with treatment response are urgently needed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In first-line treatment of advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (aRCC), the KEYNOTE-426 study demonstrated a significant 
progression-free survival and overall survival for pembrolizumab plus axitinib 
in comparison with sunitinib. The objective of the current study was to evaluate 
the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib for 
previously untreated patients with aRCC in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the costs and health outcomes of 
treatment of aRCC with sunitinib or pembrolizumab plus axitinib. Univariable and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of 
the model outcomes. Additional subgroup analyses were also performed. The 
primary outputs of the model included the total cost, life-years (LYs), 
quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Pembrolizumab plus axitinib provided an additional 2.461 LYs (1.650 
QALYs). The total cost per patient was US$178,725 for pembrolizumab plus 
axitinib and US$87,693 for sunitinib. The ICER for pembrolizumab plus axitinib 
was US$55,185/QALY versus sunitinib. Sensitivity analyses found the results to 
be most sensitive to pembrolizumab cost and overall hazard ratio. The results of 
subgroup analyses showed that the ICER remained greater than US$32,000/QALY 
across the all patient subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab plus axitinib is not likely to be cost effective 
versus sunitinib for patients with previously untreated aRCC at a threshold 
value of US$29,306/QALY.

PURPOSE: Seoul and Busan are the two largest cities in Korea. However, life 
expectancy (LE) in Busan is shorter than in Seoul and among the total Korean 
population. This study was conducted to decompose age- and cause-specific 
contributions to the LE difference between Seoul and Busan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained population and mortality data for Seoul and 
Busan between 2015 and 2017 from Statistics Korea. We applied Arriaga's 
decomposition method to life table data to estimate age- and cause-specific 
contributions to the LE difference between Seoul and Busan.
RESULTS: During 2015-2017, LE in Busan was shorter than in Seoul by 2.22 years. 
Roughly two-thirds of the LE gap between Seoul and Busan was due to excess 
mortality among elderly people in Busan. The ≥85 age group alone contributed to 
approximately 20% of the LE gap, while no meaningful contribution was made by 
the 1-24 age groups. Cardiovascular disease accounted for over 40% of the total 
LE gap between Seoul and Busan, and this factor was more prominent in women. The 
top 15 leading specific causes of deaths explained nearly the entire LE 
difference between Seoul and Busan.
CONCLUSION: The difference in LE between Seoul and Busan was due to higher 
mortality rate in Busan than in Seoul, especially in the elderly population and 
from cardiovascular diseases. Information on age- and cause-specific 
contributions to the LE difference between Seoul and Busan may guide health 
policy-makers to plan strategies for reducing the gap in LE.

National Economy and Public Administration, Moscow, Russian Federation.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to improve the measurement of ageing in 
Oceania taking into account characteristics of populations and, in particular, 
changes in life expectancy.
METHOD: Using past and projected life tables, we calculated prospective old age 
dependency ratios (POADRs) to 2060, placing the boundary to old age at a moving 
point with a fixed remaining life expectancy (RLE) for thirteen territories of 
Oceania.
RESULTS: In some territories, POADRs grow less rapidly than old age dependency 
ratios (OADRs). For example, in Australia and Guam, the OADR is forecast to 
increase from 0.20 and 0.07 in 1980, respectively, to 0.45 and 0.39 in 2050-55, 
while the POADR is forecast to increase from 0.17 and 0.07 to 0.19 and 0.19, 
respectively, over the same period.
CONCLUSION: Policymakers may consider this more rational approach to measurement 
when considering holistic policy responses to both current issues relating to 
ageing and mitigating against future challenges.

Reducing mortality of working-age population is a potential reserve for 
preserving Russia's population and its labor force. In addition, the task of 
analyzing health of economically active citizens of our country is inextricably 
linked with the challenge of developing strategy of development of reproductive 
potential at the regional level. As reproductive or generative woman's age is 
defined precisely enough, and such unambiguous definition for men is lacking, 
the study used mortality rates, calculated for men and women of working age (16 
- 59 years and 16 - 54 years respectively) and officially published by the 
Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) as characteristics of 
reproductive health. The analysis of mortality rate for working age men and 
women in the Republic of Chuvashia as well as the structure of main causes of 
death are presented for 2002-2016 in comparison with average indicators for the 
Russian Federation. The mortality rate of the mentioned population category in 
Republic of Chuvashia since 2002 has decreased by 17.5% in all age groups except 
women aged 30-39 years. At this, the rate of mortality decreased in men during 
the analyzed period is higher than in women i.e. 20.5% and 19.3% respectively. 
As compared with 2002, the percentage of circulatory system diseases, neoplasms, 
digestive system diseases increased with a simultaneous decrease in the 
proportion of "external" causes in mortality structure of able-bodied population 
of the Republic of Chuvashia in 2016. Throughout the analyzed period relative 
mortality rates of able-bodied men are four times and higher than those of 
women. The analysis of dynamics characteristics in mortality level and structure 
among working age women and men as well as risk factors that contribute to its 
growth, can become the basis for developing an organizational improvement 
program of rendering medical care to economically active population as a 
component of regional strategy of increasing the level of reproductive 
potential.

Alternative non-IgG binding proteins developed for therapy are small in size 
and, thus, are rapidly cleared from the circulation by renal filtration. To 
avoid repeated injection or continuous infusion for the maintenance of 
therapeutic serum concentrations, extensions of unfolded polypeptides have been 
developed to prolong serum half-life, but systematic, comparative studies 
investigating the influence of their size and charge on serum half-life, 
extravasation, tumor localization and excretion mechanisms have so far been 
lacking. Here we used a high-affinity Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein (DARPin) 
targeting the tumor marker epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in a 
preclinical tumor xenograft model in mice, and fused it with a series of defined 
unstructured polypeptides. We used three different sizes of two previously 
described polypeptides, an uncharged one consisting of only Pro, Ala and Ser 
(termed PAS) and a charged one consisting of Pro, Ala, Ser, Thr, Gly, Glu 
(termed XTEN) and performed for the first time a precise comparative 
localization, distribution and extravasation study. Pharmacokinetic analysis 
showed a clear linear relationship between hydrodynamic radius and serum 
half-life across both polypeptides, reaching a half-life of up to 21 h in mice. 
Tumor uptake was EpCAM-dependent and directly proportional to half-life and 
size, showing an even tumor penetration for all fusion proteins without 
unspecific accumulation in non-target tissue. Unexpectedly, charge had no 
influence on any parameter, neither tumor nor tissue accumulation nor kidney 
elimination kinetics. Thus, both polypeptide types have a very similar potential 
for precise half-life modification and tumor targeting.

Modulation of the human gut microbiota through probiotics, prebiotics and 
dietary fibre are recognised strategies to improve health and prevent disease. 
Yet we are only beginning to understand the impact of these interventions on the 
gut microbiota and the physiological consequences for the human host, thus 
forging the way towards evidence-based scientific validation. However, in many 
studies a percentage of participants can be defined as 'non-responders' and 
scientists are beginning to unravel what differentiates these from 'responders;' 
and it is now clear that an individual's baseline microbiota can influence an 
individual's response. Thus, microbiome composition can potentially serve as a 
biomarker to predict responsiveness to interventions, diets and dietary 
components enabling greater opportunities for its use towards disease prevention 
and health promotion. In Part I of this two-part review, we reviewed the current 
state of the science in terms of the gut microbiota and the role of diet and 
dietary components in shaping it and subsequent consequences for human health. 
In Part II, we examine the efficacy of gut-microbiota modulating therapies at 
different life stages and their potential to aid in the management of 
undernutrition and overnutrition. Given the significance of an individual's gut 
microbiota, we investigate the feasibility of microbiome testing and we discuss 
guidelines for evaluating the scientific validity of evidence for providing 
personalised microbiome-based dietary advice. Overall, this review highlights 
the potential value of the microbiome to prevent disease and maintain or promote 
health and in doing so, paves the pathway towards commercialisation.

Background. In state-transition models (STMs), decision problems are 
conceptualized using health states and transitions among those health states 
after predefined time cycles. The naive, commonly applied method (C) for cycle 
length conversion transforms all transition probabilities separately. In STMs 
with more than 2 health states, this method is not accurate. Therefore, we aim 
to describe and compare the performance of method C with that of alternative 
matrix transformation methods. Design. We compare 2 alternative matrix 
transformation methods (Eigenvalue method [E], Schure-Padé method [SP]) to 
method C applied in an STM of 3 different treatment strategies for women with 
breast cancer. We convert the given annual transition matrix into a 
monthly-cycle matrix and evaluate induced transformation errors for the 
transition matrices and the long-term outcomes: life years, quality-adjusted 
life-years, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and the performance 
related to the decisions. In addition, we applied these transformation methods 
to randomly generated annual transition matrices with 4, 7, 10, and 20 health 
states. Results. In theory, there is no generally applicable correct 
transformation method. Based on our simulations, SP resulted in the smallest 
transformation-induced discrepancies for generated annual transition matrices 
for 2 treatment strategies. E showed slightly smaller discrepancies than SP in 
the strategy, where one of the direct transitions between health states was 
excluded. For long-term outcomes, the largest discrepancy occurred for estimated 
costs applying method C. For higher dimensional models, E performs best. 
Conclusions. In our modeling examples, matrix transformations (E, SP) perform 
better than transforming all transition probabilities separately (C). Transition 
probabilities based on alternative conversion methods should therefore be 
applied in sensitivity analyses.

BACKGROUND: The optimal reconstructive method after diaphyseal malignant bone 
tumor resection remains controversial. This multicenter clinical study was 
designed to investigate the clinical value and complications of segmental 
prosthesis in the repair of diaphyseal defects.
METHODS: We present 49 patients from three clinical centers treated with wide 
resection for primary or metastatic bone tumors involving the diaphysis of the 
femur, tibia, humerus, or ulna, followed by reconstruction using a modular 
intramedullary segmental prosthesis.
RESULTS: Enrolled patients included 23 men and 26 women with a mean age of 
63.3 years. Of these, seven patients had primary bone tumors and 42 patients had 
metastatic lesions. At the mean follow-up of 13.7 months, 17 patients were 
alive, 31 patients were deceased due to tumor progression, and one patient was 
dead of another reason. There were eight nononcologic complications (two with 
radial nerve injury, three with delayed incision healing, two with aseptic 
loosening in the proximal humerus prosthetic stem and one with structural 
failure) and three oncologic complications (three with primary tumor recurrence) 
among all patients. The incidence of complications in primary tumor patients 
(4/7, 57.1%) was higher than that in patients with metastatic tumors (7/42, 
16.7%) (p = 0.036). Aseptic loosening and mechanical complications were not 
common for patients with primary tumors, although the reconstruction length 
difference was statistically significant (p = 0.023). No statistically 
significant differences were observed in limb function, while the mean 
musculoskeletal tumor society score was 21.2 in femora, 19.6 in humeri, and 17.8 
in tibiae (p = 0.134).
CONCLUSIONS: Segmental prostheses represent an optional method for the 
reconstruction of diaphyseal defects in patients with limited life expectancy. 
Segmental prostheses in the humerus experienced more complications than those 
used to treat lesions in the femur.

The thalassemias constitute a variable group of anemias that result from 
autosomal recessive inherited defects in the production of hemoglobin. The life 
expectancy of thalassemia patients has been extended over the last decades as a 
result of key milestones being achieved in optimizing management with 
transfusion and iron chelation therapy. Such advances have prolonged the 
survival of thalassemia patients and improved their overall quality of life. 
However, this increase in life expectancy has led to the manifestation of 
several morbidities, including multiple types of solid and hematologic 
malignancies. In this review we report the different types of solid and 
hematological malignancies that can develop in thalassemia patients, in addition 
to the possible predisposing factors and mechanisms behind their development.

OBJECTIVE: The need for clinical staff to reliably identify patients with a 
shortened life expectancy is an obstacle to improving palliative and end-of-life 
care. We developed and evaluated the feasibility of an automated tool to 
identify patients with a high risk of death in the next year to prompt treating 
physicians to consider a palliative approach and reduce the identification 
burden faced by clinical staff.
METHODS: Two-phase feasibility study conducted at two quaternary healthcare 
facilities in Toronto, Canada. We modified the Hospitalised-patient One-year 
Mortality Risk (HOMR) score, which identifies patients having an elevated 1-year 
mortality risk, to use only data available at the time of admission. An 
application prompted the admitting team when patients had an elevated mortality 
risk and suggested a palliative approach. The incidences of goals of care 
discussions and/or palliative care consultation were abstracted from medical 
records.
RESULTS: Our model (C-statistic=0.89) was found to be similarly accurate to the 
original HOMR score and identified 15.8% and 12.2% of admitted patients at Sites 
1 and 2, respectively. Of 400 patients included, the most common indications for 
admission included a frailty condition (219, 55%), chronic organ failure (91, 
23%) and cancer (78, 20%). At Site 1 (integrated notification), patients with 
the notification were significantly more likely to have a discussion about goals 
of care and/or palliative care consultation (35% vs 20%, p = 0.016). At Site 2 
(electronic mail), there was no significant difference (45% vs 53%, p = 0.322).
CONCLUSIONS: Our application is an accurate, feasible and timely identification 
tool for patients at elevated risk of death in the next year and may be 
effective for improving palliative and end-of-life care.

Navigating a changing environment requires associating stimuli and actions with 
their likely outcomes and modifying these associations when they change. These 
processes involve the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Although some molecular 
mediators have been identified, developmental factors are virtually unknown. We 
hypothesized that the cell adhesion factor β1-integrin is essential to OFC 
function, anticipating developmental windows during which β1-integrins might be 
more influential than others. We discovered that OFC-selective β1-integrin 
silencing before adolescence, but not later, impaired the ability of mice to 
extinguish conditioned fear and select actions based on their likely outcomes. 
Early-life knock-down also reduced the densities of dendritic spines, the 
primary sites of excitatory plasticity in the brain, and weakened sensitivity to 
cortical inputs. Notwithstanding these defects in male mice, females were 
resilient to OFC (but not hippocampal) β1-integrin loss. Existing literature 
suggests that resilience may be explained by estradiol-mediated transactivation 
of β1-integrins and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (trkB). Accordingly, we 
discovered that a trkB agonist administered during adolescence corrected 
reward-related decision making in β1-integrin-deficient males. In sum, 
developmental β1-integrins are indispensable for OFC function later in 
life.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a subregion of the 
frontal cortex that allows organisms to link behaviors and stimuli with 
anticipated outcomes, and to make predictions about the consequences of one's 
behavior. Aspects of OFC development are particularly prolonged, extending well 
into adolescence, likely optimizing organisms' abilities to prospectively 
calculate the consequences of their actions and select behaviors appropriately; 
these decision making strategies improve as young individuals mature into 
adulthood. Molecular factors are not, however, well understood. Our experiments 
reveal that a cell adhesion protein termed "β1-integrin" is necessary for OFC 
neuronal maturation and function. Importantly, β1-integrins operate during a 
critical period equivalent to early adolescence in humans to optimize the 
ability of organisms to update expectancies later in life.

Mammography screening may save women from dying of breast cancer, although it 
has not been shown to reduce all-cause mortality. Screening also leads to 
overdiagnosis and many false positive mammograms aggravating women's 
quality-of-life. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) analyses of mammography 
screening have so far, calculated life years gained assuming that all prevented 
breast cancer deaths translate into a reduction in all-cause mortality. We 
calculated net QALYs in two hypothesized cohorts of 100,000 Norwegian women; one 
screened biennially from age 50 to 69 years and one not screened. We followed 
both cohorts to age 85 years. We used EQ-5D and an alternative equity weighted 
QALY instrument to estimate utility losses. In the screening cohort, we assumed 
20% false positive tests during screening, different levels of overdiagnosis 
(20-75%) and different levels of breast cancer mortality reduction (10-30%). We 
assumed that reductions in breast cancer mortality only to a limited extent (20, 
50 or 80%), resulted in reductions in all-cause mortality. We calculated both 
undiscounted and discounted (4%) QALYs. Assuming that 50% of the reduction in 
breast cancer mortality translated to a reduction in all-cause mortality and 
using estimated levels of benefits and harms in modern screening programs 
(50-75% overdiagnosis and 10% reduction in breast cancer mortality), 
undiscounted equity weighted QALY loss varied from 437 to 875 per 100,000 women. 
Using the levels of benefit and harms as reported in 30-40 years old randomized 
trials (30% overdiagnosis and 15% reduction in breast cancer mortality), 
undiscounted equity weighted QALY gain was 535 per 100,000. Net QALY in modern 
mammography screening in Norway is negative. Results could also be 
representative for Sweden, Denmark, UK and the US.

Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by 
disease-associated variants in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene. The 
current Pompe mutation database provides a severity rating of GAA variants based 
on in silico predictions and expression studies. Here, we extended the database 
with clinical information of reported phenotypes. We added additional in silico 
predictions for effects on splicing and protein function and for cross reactive 
immunologic material (CRIM) status, minor allele frequencies, and molecular 
analyses. We analyzed 867 patients and 562 GAA variants. Based on their 
combination with a GAA null allele (i.e., complete deficiency of GAA enzyme 
activity), 49% of the 422 disease-associated variants could be linked to classic 
infantile, childhood, or adult phenotypes. Predictions and immunoblot analyses 
identified 131 CRIM negative and 216 CRIM positive variants. While 
disease-associated missense variants were found throughout the GAA protein, they 
were enriched up to seven-fold in the catalytic site. Fifteen percent of 
disease-associated missense variants were predicted to affect splicing. This 
should be confirmed using splicing assays. Inclusion of clinical severity rating 
in the Pompe mutation database provides an invaluable tool for diagnosis, 
prognosis of disease progression, treatment regimens, and the future development 
of personalized medicine for Pompe disease.

Endogenously produced hydrogen sulfide was proposed to be an underlying 
mechanism of lifespan extension via methionine restriction. However, hydrogen 
sulfide regulation and its beneficial effects via methionine restriction remain 
elusive. Here, we identified the genes required to increase hydrogen sulfide 
production under methionine restriction condition using genome-wide 
high-throughput screening in yeast strains with single-gene deletions. Sulfate 
assimilation-related genes, such as MET1, MET3, MET5, and MET10, were found to 
be particularly crucial for hydrogen sulfide production. Interestingly, 
methionine restriction failed to increase hydrogen sulfide production in mutant 
strains; however, it successfully extended chronological lifespan and reduced 
reactive oxygen species levels. Altogether, our observations suggested that 
increased hydrogen sulfide production via methionine restriction is not the 
mechanism underlying extended yeast lifespan, even though increased hydrogen 
sulfide production occurred simultaneously with yeast lifespan extension under 
methionine restriction condition.

BACKGROUND: Epilepsy surgery is an alternative to continued antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs) in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to measure, model, and compare the 
medical costs and impacts on health-related quality of life (HRQL) of epilepsy 
surgery versus continued medical treatment with AEDs in children with DRE.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was created to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of epilepsy surgery relative to continued medical treatment 
with AEDs. The model was based on costing and effectiveness data collected from 
105 children with DRE who were operated on at the Royal Children's Hospital, 
Melbourne, Australia. The mean cost of conducting epilepsy surgery was AU$ 
61,417 per person. Effectiveness of continued medical treatment was sourced from 
best available literature. In the absence of published utility values for 
pediatric patients with epilepsy and ethical approval to contact patients 
directly, HRQL was estimated by four clinicians using the Child Health Utility 9 
Dimension (CHU9D). Outcome measures were seizure freedom and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The costs over 7.6 years of follow-up were AU$ 219,297 for the surgical 
treatment group compared with AU$ 170,583 for the medical treatment group. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for surgically vs medical treatment 
was AU$ 76,538 per additional patient attaining seizure freedom and AU$ 75,541 
per additional QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Epilepsy surgery resulted in a greater reduction of seizures and 
improvement in HRQL but was more expensive than continued medical treatment with 
AEDs. Including benefits outside of a healthcare perspective would likely lead 
to a more compelling cost-effective argument.

OBJECTIVE: Palliative pelvic exenteration (PPE) is a technically complex 
operation with high morbidity and mortality rates, considered in patients with 
limited life expectancy. There is little evidence to guide practice. We 
performed a systematic review to evaluate the impact of PPE on symptom relief 
and quality of life (QoL).
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines 
using Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASe, and PubMed databases for studies reporting on 
outcomes of PPE for symptom relief or QoL. Descriptive statistics were used on 
pooled patient cohorts.
RESULTS: Twenty-three historical cohorts and case series were included, 
comprising 509 patients. No comparative studies were found. Most malignancies 
were of colorectal, gynaecological and urological origin. Common indications for 
PPE were pain, symptomatic fistula, bleeding, malodour, obstruction and pelvic 
sepsis. The pooled median postoperative morbidity rate was 53.6% (13-100%), the 
median in-hospital mortality was 6.3% (0-66.7%), and median OS was 14 months 
(4-40 months). Some symptom relief was reported in a median of 79% (50-100%) of 
the patients, although the magnitude of effect was poorly measured. Data for QoL 
measures were inconclusive. Five studies discouraged performing PPE in any 
patient, while 18 studies concluded that the procedure can be considered in 
highly selected patients.
CONCLUSION: Available evidence on PPE is of low-quality. Morbidity and mortality 
rates are high with a short median OS interval. While some symptom relief may be 
afforded by this procedure, evidence for improvement in QoL is limited. A highly 
selective individualised approach is required to optimise the risk:benefit 
equation.

BACKGROUND: The recent PARTNER S3i trial compared transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI) using the third-generation SAPIEN 3 device to surgical 
aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in intermediate-risk patients with severe 
symptomatic aortic stenosis. Using data from PARTNER S3i, we performed a 
contemporary cost-effectiveness analysis of current-generation TAVI versus SAVR 
from the Australian healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model with monthly cycles and a ten-year horizon was 
constructed to estimate costs, life-years and quality adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) associated with TAVI and SAVR. Efficacy inputs were derived from the 
PARTNER S3i study. Costs were estimated from published sources. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: TAVI was found to have higher immediate procedural costs than SAVR, 
driven primarily by the cost of the transcatheter valve. This was offset by a 
shorter length of hospitalisation following TAVI, such that the combined cost of 
initial procedure and hospitalisation was lower in TAVI compared to SAVR. With 
5% annual discounting, total costs over ten-years were $50,515 AUD in TAVI and 
$60,144 AUD in SAVR, and TAVI was found to produce 0.33 more life years and 0.31 
more QALYs than SAVR. Thus, from a health economic perspective, TAVI was 
dominant compared to SAVR. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, with 
TAVI being dominant in 68% of 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations and cost-effective 
in 92% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI is likely to be highly cost-effective compared to SAVR in 
intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis.

OBJECTIVE: To model the risk of radiation-induced malignancy from computed 
tomography urography (CTU) in evaluation of gross hematuria and contrast this 
with the benefits of urinary tract cancer detection when compared to renal 
ultrasound.
METHODS: A PUBMED-based literature search was performed to identify model 
inputs. Estimates of radiation-induced malignancy rates were obtained from the 
Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report with dose extrapolation 
using the linear no-threshold model.
RESULTS: Male gender and age over 50 years were associated with a relative risk 
of upper tract malignancy of 2.04 and 2.95, respectively. The risk of upper 
tract malignancy missed by renal ultrasound ranged from 0.055% in females under 
50 to 0.51% in males over 50. Risk of CTU-induced malignancy with associated 
loss of life expectancy ranged from 0.25% and 0.027 years in females under 50 to 
0.08% and 0.0054 years in males over 50. For CTU to be superior to renal 
ultrasound, an undiagnosed upper tract malignancy would have to carry a loss of 
life expectancy of 49.2 years in females under 50, 13.4 years in males under 50, 
2.6 years in females over 50, and 1.1 years in males over 50.
CONCLUSION: In low-risk patients, CTU for evaluation of gross hematuria may 
carry a significant risk of radiation-induced secondary malignancy relative to 
the diagnostic benefit offered over renal ultrasound.

A series of S-allyl-l-cysteine (SAC) with garlic acid conjugates as 
anti-inflammatory agents were designed and synthesized. Among the 40 tested 
compounds, SMU-8c exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity to 
Pam3CSK4-induced nitric oxide (NO) in RAW264.7 macrophages with IC50 of 
22.54 ± 2.60 μM. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) study suggested that 
the esterified carboxyl group, carbon chain extension and methoxylation phenol 
hydroxy could improve the anti-inflammatory efficacy. Preliminary
