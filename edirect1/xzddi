care. Despite restricting mepolizumab use to patients with a higher baseline 
exacerbation rate (3 in the past year) in a scenario analysis, the ICER remained 
high at SGD238 876 (USD 169 602) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: At its current price, mepolizumab is not considered a cost-effective 
use of healthcare resources in Singapore. Substantial price reductions for 
mepolizumab are required to improve its cost-effectiveness to an acceptable 
range. These results will be useful to inform national funding decisions.

When looking at life expectancy (LE) by sex, women live longer than men in all 
countries. Biological factors alone do not explain gender differences in LE, and 
examining structural differences may help illuminate other explanatory factors. 
The aim of this research is to analyse the influence of gender inequality on the 
gender gap in LE globally. We have carried out a regression analysis between the 
gender gap in relativised LE and the UN Gender Inequality Index (GII), with a 
sensitivity analysis conducted for its three dimensions, stratified by the six 
World Health Organization (WHO) regions. We adjusted the model by taking into 
consideration gross national income (GNI), democratic status and rural 
population. The results indicated a positive association for the European region 
(ß=0.184) and the Americas (ß=0.136) in our adjusted model. Conversely, for the 
African region, the relations between gender equality and the LE gender gap were 
found to be negative (ß=-0.125). The findings suggest that in the WHO European 
region and the Americas, greater gender equality leads to a narrowing of the 
gender LE gap, while it has a contrary relationship in Africa. We suggest that 
this could be because only higher scores in the GII between men and women show 
health benefits.

BACKGROUND. This study estimates the maximum price at which mesenchymal stem 
cell (MSC) therapy is deemed cost-effective for septic shock patients and 
identifies parameters that are most important in making treatment decisions.
METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model according to the sepsis care 
trajectory to simulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of septic 
shock patients receiving either MSC therapy or usual care over their lifetime. 
We calculated the therapeutic headroom by multiplying the gains attributable to 
MSCs with willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold and derived the maximum 
reimbursable price (MRP) from the expected net monetary benefit and savings 
attributable to MSCs. We performed scenario analyses to assess the impact of 
changes to assumptions on the study findings. A value of information analysis is 
performed to identify parameters with greatest impact on the uncertainty around 
the cost-effectiveness of MSC therapy.
RESULTS: At a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the therapeutic headroom and 
MRP of MSC therapy were $20,941 and $16,748, respectively; these estimates 
increased with the larger WTP values and the greater impact of MSCs on 
in-hospital mortality and hospital discharge rates. The parameters with greatest 
information value were MSC's impact on in-hospital mortality and the baseline 
septic shock in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSION: At a common WTP of $50,000/QALY, MSC therapy is deemed to be 
economically attractive if its unit cost does not exceed $16,748. This ceiling 
price can be increased to $101,450 if the therapy significantly reduces both 
in-hospital mortality and increases hospital discharge rates.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of stand-alone and blended 
internet-based vestibular rehabilitation (VR) in comparison with usual care (UC) 
for chronic vestibular syndromes in general practice.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a three-armed, individually randomised 
controlled trial.
SETTING: 59 Dutch general practices.
PARTICIPANTS: 322 adults, aged 50 years and older with a chronic vestibular 
syndrome.
INTERVENTIONS: Stand-alone VR consisted of a 6-week, internet-based intervention 
with weekly online sessions and daily exercises. In blended VR, this 
intervention was supplemented with face-to-face physiotherapy support. UC group 
participants received usual general practice care without restrictions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Societal costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
Vertigo Symptom Scale-Short Form (VSS-SF), clinically relevant response (≥3 
points VSS-SF improvement).
RESULTS: Mean societal costs in both the stand-alone and blended VR groups were 
statistically non-significantly higher than in the UC group (mean difference 
(MD) €504, 95% CI -1082 to 2268; and €916, 95% CI -663 to 2596). Both 
stand-alone and blended VR groups reported non-significantly more QALYs than the 
UC group (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.04; and 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03), and 
significantly better VSS-SF Scores (MD 3.8 points, 95% CI 1.7 to 6.0; and 3.3 
points, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.2). For stand-alone VR compared with UC, the probability 
of cost-effectiveness was 0.95 at a willingness-to-pay ratio of €24 161/QALY, 
€600/point improvement in VSS-SF and €8000/clinically relevant responder in 
VSS-SF. For blended VR versus UC, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 0.95 
at a willingness-to-pay ratio of €123 335/QALY, €900/point improvement in VSS-SF 
and €24 000/clinically relevant responder in VSS-SF.
CONCLUSION: Stand-alone and blended internet-based VR non-significantly 
increased QALYs and significantly reduced vestibular symptoms compared with UC, 
while costs in both groups were non-significantly higher. Stand-alone VR has the 
highest probability to be cost-effective compared with UC.

Medical Science, New Delhi, 110029 India.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective disease etiologically 
related with FBN-1 gene mutation. The altered microfibril protein structure 
result in characteristic cardiovascular abnormalities including aortic root 
dilatation, aortic root aneurysms, and aortic dissections. Aortic root aneurysms 
and subsequent dissection are the major causes of reduced life expectancy in MFS 
patients. Prophylactic aortic root replacement has improved the survival of 
patients with MFS. Elective root replacement carries very low mortality and 
morbidity. Emergency root replacement for dissection is accompanied with higher 
early mortality and late deaths/interventions. Both the techniques of aortic 
root replacement, total root replacement (TRR) with a prosthetic valved conduit, 
and valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) yield excellent early and late 
results. Considering the low risk of prosthetic valve-related events, the 
improved long-term survival, and event-free survival, TRR continues to be a very 
effective surgical option. VSSR also seems to be a good option for the first 10 
to 15 years following surgery in MFS patients. The choice of procedure depends 
upon available expertise, patients' choice, feasibility of anticoagulation, 
possibility of pregnancy, and lifestyle of the patient. Aortic root morphology 
and state of valve cusps also affect the decision making. In recent times, 
personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) with a macroporous mesh sleeve 
has also emerged as a promising alternative to aortic root replacement. All 
these patients need close monitoring for whole life after surgical intervention.

In industrialized countries, the most common etiology of mitral regurgitation 
(MR) is degenerative mitral valve (MV) disease. The natural history of severe 
degenerative MR is poor. However, its appropriate and timely correction is 
associated with a life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. 
Surgical MV repair is the gold-standard treatment. This review will focus on the 
most recent evidence with a specific emphasis on surgical indications, timing of 
treatment, contemporary surgical techniques, Heart Teams, and Centers of 
Excellence.

Nowadays, the population is rapidly ageing because of increasing life expectancy 
and decreasing birth rates. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review is to 
prepare a comprehensive overview which identifies the activities of daily living 
(ADLs) that are gradually reduced among patients with dementia, as well as 
explore the therapies applied in relation to dementia and how they effectively 
improve the quality of life (QoL) of patients and caregivers. Furthermore, we 
aim to summarise the ADL activities influenced by therapies and examine the 
treatment costs and care for patients so that recommendations for research and 
development (R&D) can be made to improve both the QoL of people with dementia 
and cost-saving measures. The research focuses on four selected 
neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson, vascular dementia, and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, the peer-reviewed English written 
articles from 2014 to 2019 were searched between September 1 and December 13, 
2019. Twenty-seven papers were included in the analysis. The results show that 
essential assistance occurs in connection with activities: eating, drinking, 
dressing, bathing, personal hygiene, use of the toilet, and transport. By 
contrast, shopping or cleaning is not addressed as much. A lower ability to take 
care of oneself is connected with poor patient health and higher social care 
costs because the patient requires care from external sources, such as home aid 
or nurse visits. The challenge that remains is to shift new knowledge from 
scientific disciplines and connect it with the needs of patients to remove 
legitimate barriers and increase the acceptance of new solutions by 
popularisation. Additionally, regarding the burden on caregivers, it would be 
appropriate to promote this area of education and employment so that family 
members can use formal caregivers, ensuring them free time and much-needed rest.

Gaps in end-of-life care and lack of support for family carers in Poland and 
Central Eastern Europe.

Krakowiak P(1).

Author information:

The growth of life expectancy in Central Eastern Europe and increase in the 
number of older people in that region are the consequences of changes in the 
1990s period, connected to transition from the communism into a market economy. 
Central Eastern Europe is already facing consequences of fast ageing and 
insufficient development of state health care and social services. Those result 
in gaps in the provision of end-of-life care and overburden of family 
caregivers. This essay addresses gaps in end-of-life care, showing the 
development of hospice-palliative care on one side, and highlighting main 
problems with long-term care on the other. There is scarce support for informal 
caregivers and lack of cooperation between health and social care. End-of-life 
care is over medicalized in hospice-palliative care and hardly existing in 
long-term care. Dying is more a social than medical event, and as such, it 
should be cared for by compassionate communities, encouraging cooperation of 
professionals with family caregivers and society. Unfortunately, to date, there 
is no adequate cooperation in social dimension of end-of-life care in most of 
Central Eastern Europe. The social dimension of end-of-life care has to be 
recognized and empowered with the health promoting palliative care and 
introduction of compassionate communities in Central Eastern Europe.

OBJECTIVES: Hand dysfunction causes significant reduction in quality of life in 
systemic sclerosis. We assessed the validity and reliability of the culturally 
adapted Indian version of Cochin Hand Function Scale (I-CHFS). We determined the 
factors contributing to hand dysfunction and its burden on quality of life.
METHOD: I-CHFS was formulated by replacing five questions (questions 7, 9, 10, 
14 and 15) in CHFS which were determined as unsuitable in an Indian setting. The 
instrument was assessed for acceptability, reliability, reproducibility and 
validity measures. A total of 87 patients were assessed for various demographic 
and disease parameters, hand disability and quality of life.
RESULTS: The median I-CHFS score was 22(5-54) and 04 (0.5-17.5) among diffuse 
(dcSSc) and limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc). I-CHFS showed good 
reproducibility (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.92) and a strong 
correlation with I-HAQ (rs = 0.832), usual activities EQ-5D-5L (rs = 0.744), 
self-care EQ-5D-5L (rs = 0.734) and anxiety/depression EQ-5D-5L (rs = 0.729). It 
had moderate correlation with pain/discomfort EQ-5D-5L (rs = 0.661) and hand HAQ 
(rs = 0.576) and poor correlation with HAQ-DI (rs = 0.396) and modified Rodnan 
skin score (rs = 0.390). Finger to table distance, finger to palm distance in 
extension and limited hand modified Rodnan skin score were significantly 
associated with higher values of I-CHFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Hand dysfunction in systemic sclerosis is substantial and 
contributes significantly to poor quality of life. The culturally adapted I-CHFS 
is a valid and reliable tool to assess it and correlated well with the overall 
disease burden. Key Points • Hand dysfunction is common among systemic sclerosis 
patients. • Hand dysfunction contributes to the poor quality of life and more 
disease burden. • Culturally adapted Cochin Hand function Scale helps assess 
hand dysfunction among Indian scleroderma patients.

Hospital, Beijing, 100853, P.R.China.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of rotationplasty in treating 
osteosarcoma of distal femur in children.
METHODS: A clinical data of 10 children with osteosarcoma of distal femur 
treated with rotationplasty between March 2014 and June 2016 was retrospectively 
analyzed. There were 7 boys and 3 girls with an average age of 6.7 years (range, 
4-10 years). There were 4 cases of osteoblastic osteosarcoma, 4 cases of mixed 
osteosarcoma, and 2 cases of chondroblastic osteosarcoma. All children were 
staged as Enneking stage ⅡB. The disease duration ranged from 3.5 to 6.0 months 
(mean, 4.6 months). The lower limb functional scoring system of 1993 
Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS93), Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS), 
and knee mobility were used to evaluate postoperative function. Tumor recurrence 
and metastases were monitored by radiograph.
RESULTS: Poor superficial incision healing occurred in 1 patient, and healed 
after dressing change. The other incisions healed by first intention. All 
children were followed up 24-72 months (mean, 52.6 months). No local recurrence 
was observed during follow-up. Three of the ten patients suffered from 
metastases including 1 dying of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, 1 alive 
with tumor, and 1 tumor free survival. Painful callosities and ulcers which 
related to prosthetic wear occurred in 2 patients and turned up after optimizing 
prosthetic fit and physiotherapy. The fracture healing time was 2.5-5.0 months 
(mean, 3.5 months). All children could walk independently at 4 months 
postoperatively. At last follow-up, the MSTS93 score was 19-25 (mean, 22) and 
the TESS score was 87-93 (mean, 90). The extension of knee joint mobility with 
artificial limbs was 0°-10° (mean, 5°), and the flexion of knee joint mobility 
with artificial limbs was 85°-95° (mean, 90.5°).
CONCLUSION: Rotationplasty in treating osteosarcoma of distal femur in children 
with limb salvage difficulties can effectively preserve the limb function and 
improve the quality of life, and it can be used as an alternative to amputation.

[Multilevel arterialization of the venous bed in treatment of critical lower 
limb ischaemia].

[Article in Russian; Abstract available in Russian from the publisher]

Ivanin SL(1).

Author information:

Station Sverdlovsk-Passenger of the Open Joint Stock Company 'Russian Railways', 
Yekaterinburg, Russia.

Presented herein is original experience in using a technique of arterialization 
in patients with critical lower limb ischaemia on the background of diffuse 
multilevel occlusive lesions of femoral, crural arteries and arteries of the 
foot in 214 patients. We used a new method of treatment by means of oxygenation 
of the sural group of muscles and the foot through the small saphenous vein and 
indirect communicating veins. This method does not require destruction of the 
valvular apparatus of the communicants themselves, promoting opening of 
previously not functioning ones, as well as appears to be a powerful stimulus 
for the development of collateral circulation of the extremity. Alterations 
introduced into the design characteristics of a valvulotome make it possible to 
avoid lateral injury of the venous wall in the area of confluence of 
tributaries, preventing incomplete resection of the valve. The method expands 
the boundaries of operability of patients with the absence of the receiving 
arterial bed of the calf and foot. It may be combined with arterial primary and 
repeat reconstructions in patients with depleted receiving channel of the calf 
as an effective additional path of outflow. It also makes it possible to lower 
the level of amputation in the developed necrosis of the distal part of the 
foot. Based on clinical laboratory and instrumental findings, the patients were 
diagnosed by the aetiological factor of the occlusive process and its extension, 
substantiating the indications for operative treatment with the use of one or 
another venous basin. Comparative assessment of reversion of arterial blood flow 
through the great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, and posterior tibial 
vein, according to the findings of bioelectromagnetic diagnosis of reactivity of 
tissues demonstrated that the most effective method was that of arterialization 
thought the small saphenous vein. With the help of the questionnaire of quality 
of life in patients with performed arterialization of the calf and foot through 
the small saphenous vein for critical lower limb ischaemia we obtained 5-year 
remote results. Upon completion of this period, 87.3% of the limbs were saved 
and composite measures of the patients' quality of life proved to be high, 
ranging from 53 to 69 points.

Publisher: В работе представлен оригинальный опыт применения технологии 
артериализации у пациентов с критической ишемией нижних конечностей на фоне 
распространенных этажных окклюзионных поражений артерий бедра, голени и артерий 
стопы у 214 пациентов. Применен новый метод лечения путем оксигенации суральной 
группы мышц и стопы через малую подкожную вену и непрямые коммуникантные вены. 
Данный способ не требует разрушения клапанного аппарата самих коммуникантов, 
способствует открытию ранее не функционировавших, а также является мощным 
стимулом для развития коллатерального кровообращения конечности. Внесенные 
изменения в конструктивные особенности вальвулотома позволяют избежать бокового 
ранения стенки вены в области впадения притоков, предотвращают неполную резекцию 
клапана. Метод расширяет границы операбельности больных при отсутствии 
воспринимающего артериального русла голени и стопы. Может сочетаться с 
артериальной первичной и повторной реконструкцией у больных с обедненным 
воспринимающим руслом голени как эффективный дополнительный путь оттока. 
Позволяет снизить уровень ампутации при состоявшемся некрозе дистальной части 
стопы. На основании клинико-лабораторных и инструментальных данных больным 
устанавливался диагноз по этиологическому фактору окклюзионного процесса и его 
протяженности, обосновывались показания к оперативному лечению с использованием 
того или иного венозного бассейна. Сравнительная оценка реверсии артериального 
кровотока через большую подкожную вену, малую подкожную вену, заднюю 
большеберцовую вену, по данным биоэлектромагнитной диагностики реактивности 
тканей, показала, что наиболее эффективным является метод артериализации через 
малую подкожную вену. С помощью опросника качества жизни у больных с выполненной 
артериализацией голени и стопы через малую подкожную вену при критической ишемии 
нижних конечностей получены 5-летние отдаленные результаты. По истечении этого 
периода 87,3% сохраненных конечностей и оценка общего определения качества жизни 
пациентов является высокой и составляет от 53 до 69 баллов.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to clarify the prevalence and 
clinical characteristics of sarcopenia and dynapenia, which are muscle weakness 
with and without low muscle mass, respectively, in Japanese patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 1,328 participants 
with type 1 diabetes (n = 177), type 2 diabetes (n = 645) and without diabetes 
(n = 506). Sarcopenia was defined as a low grip strength and slow gait speed 
with low skeletal muscle mass index, whereas dynapenia was defined as low 
strengths of grip and knee extension with a normal skeletal muscle mass index. 
Participants without sarcopenia and dynapenia were defined as robust.
RESULTS: Among participants aged ≥65 years, sarcopenia and dynapenia were 
observed in 12.2% and 0.5% of individuals without diabetes, 42.9% and 11.4% of 
type 1 diabetes patients, and 20.9% and 13.9% of type 2 diabetes patients. In 
both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients, sarcopenic patients were 
significantly older and thinner, and showed a significantly higher rate of 
diabetic neuropathy than robust patients. In patients with type 1 diabetes and 
type 2 diabetes, dynapenic patients were older, and showed a higher rate of 
diabetic neuropathy and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than robust 
patients. Patients complicated with sarcopenia and dynapenia showed a 
significantly lower physical quality of life and higher rate of incidental falls 
than robust patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia and dynapenia were more frequent in patients with type 1 
diabetes and type 2 diabetes than in individuals without diabetes, which might 
contribute to their impaired quality of life and incidental falls.

PURPOSE: For patients with cancer who are older than 65 years, the 2018 ASCO 
Guideline recommends geriatric assessment (GA) be performed. However, there are 
limited data on providers' practices using GA. Therefore, ASCO's Geriatric 
Oncology Task Force conducted a survey of providers to assess practice patterns 
and barriers to GA.
METHODS: Cancer providers treating adult patients including those ≥ 65 years 
completed an online survey. Questions included those asking about awareness of 
ASCO's Geriatric Oncology Guideline (2018), use of validated GA tools, and 
perceived barriers to using GA. Descriptive statistics and statistical 
comparisons between those aware of the Guideline and those who were not were 
conducted. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.
RESULTS: Participants (N = 1,277) responded between April 5 and June 5, 2019. 
Approximately half (53%) reported awareness of the Guideline. The most 
frequently used GA tools, among those aware of the Guideline and those who were 
not, assessed functional status (69% v 50%; P < .001) and falls (62% v 45%; P < 
.001). Remaining tools were used < 50% of the time, including tools assessing 
weight loss, comorbidities, cognition, life expectancy, chemotherapy toxicity, 
mood, and noncancer mortality risk. GA use was two to four times higher among 
those who are aware of the Guideline. The most frequent barriers for those who 
reported being Guideline aware were lack of resources, specifically time (81.7%) 
and staff (77.0%). In comparison, those who were unaware of the Guideline most 
often reported the following barriers: lack of knowledge or training (78.4%), 
lack of awareness about tools (75.2%), and uncertainty about use of tools 
(75.0%).
CONCLUSION: Among providers caring for older adults, 52% were aware of the ASCO 
Guideline. Some domains were assessed frequently (eg, function, falls), whereas 
other domains were assessed rarely (eg, mood, cognition). Guideline awareness 
was associated with two to four times increased use of GA and differing 
perceived barriers. Interventions facilitating Guideline-consistent 
implementation will require various strategies to change behavior.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diagnosed chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection among pregnant women in the Netherlands is 0.26%, yet many cases 
remain undiagnosed. HCV screening and treatment of pregnant HCV carriers could 
reduce the burden of disease and limit vertical transmission from mother to 
child. We assessed the impact of HCV screening and subsequent treatment with new 
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among pregnant women in the Netherlands.
METHODS: An HCV natural history Markov transition state model was developed, to 
evaluate the public-health and economic impact of HCV screening and treatment. 
Besides all 179,000 pregnant women in the Netherlands (cohort 1), we modelled 3 
further cohorts: all 79,000 first-time pregnant women (cohort 2), 33,000 
pregnant migrant women (cohort 3) and 16,000 first-time pregnant migrant women 
(cohort 4). Each cohort was analyzed in various scenarios: i no intervention, 
i.e., the current practice, ii screen-and-treat, i.e., the most extensive 
approach involving treatment of all individuals found HCV-positive, and iii 
screen-and-treat/monitor, i.e., a strategy involving treatment of symptomatic 
(F1-F4) patients and follow-up of asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers with subsequent 
treatment only at progression.
RESULTS: For all cohorts, comparison between scenarios (ii) and (i) resulted in 
ICERs between €9,306 and €10,173 per QALY gained and 5 year budget impacts 
varying between €6,283,830 and €19,220,405. For all cohorts, comparison between 
scenarios (iii) and (i) resulted in ICERs between €1,739 and €2,749 per QALY 
gained and budget impacts varying between €1,468,670 and €5,607,556. For all 
cohorts, the ICERs (scenario iii versus ii) involved in delayed treatment of 
asymptomatic (F0) HCV carriers varied between €56,607 and €56,892, well above 
the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained and even above 
a threshold of €50,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Universal screening for HCV among all pregnant women in the 
Netherlands is cost-effective. However, it would be reasonable to consider 
smaller risk groups in view of the budget impact of the intervention.

COVID-19 is a pandemic viral infection caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, 
which is a global concern of the twenty-first century for its rapid spreading in 
a short period. Apart from its known acute respiratory involvements, the CNS 
manifestations of COVID-19 are common. These neurological symptoms are diverse 
and could range from mild nonspecific or specific symptoms such as the loss of 
various sensory perceptions, the worrying autoimmune Guillain-Barré syndrome, to 
the life-threatening acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and the CNS-mediated 
respiratory distress. An autopsy report documented the presence of SARS-CoV2 in 
brain tissues of a COVID-19 patient. However, there is no definite conclusion on 
the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 neuroinvasion. These proposed mechanisms include the 
direct viral invasion, the systemic blood circulation, or the distribution of 
infected immune cells. Concerning these different neuropathophysiologies, 
COVID-19 patients who are presenting with either the early-onset, multiple, and 
severe CNS symptoms or rapid respiratory deterioration should be suspected for 
the direct viral neuroinvasion, and appropriate management options should be 
considered. This article reviews the neurological manifestations, the proposed 
neuroinvasive mechanisms, and the potential neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV2.

The duration of maternal care, an important life-history trait affecting 
population dynamics, varies greatly within species. Yet, our understanding of 
its predictors is limited, mostly correlative and subject to misinterpretations, 
due to difficulties to disentangle the role of maternal- and offspring-related 
characteristics. We conducted path analysis on a dataset including 217 brown 
bear litters captured over a 29-year period in two populations in Sweden 
('North' and 'South') facing contrasting environmental conditions to identify 
and quantify the causes of variation in the duration of maternal care (1.5 or 
2.5 years). We showed that the causal determinants of the duration of maternal 
care were context-dependent. Contrary to their expected central role in the 
determination of the duration of maternal care, yearling mass and its direct 
determinants (i.e. litter size and maternal mass) were only important in the 
North population, where environmental conditions are harsher and the cost of 
extended maternal care presumably higher. In the South, the duration of maternal 
care was not caused by yearling mass nor any maternal or litter characteristics. 
Extension of maternal care may thus result from factors independent from 
maternal and offspring condition in the South, such as an artificial 
hunting-induced selection for longer maternal care through the legal protection 
of family groups. Our results provide an important contribution to our very 
limited knowledge of the direct and indirect determinants of the duration of 
maternal care and highlight the importance of accounting for the environmental 
context when assessing maternal reproductive tactics.

Transplant oncology defines any application of transplant medicine and surgery 
aimed at improving cancer patients' survival and/or quality of life. In 
practice, liver transplantation for selected hepato-biliary cancers is the only 
solid organ transplant with demonstrated efficacy in curing cancer. Four are the 
proposed future contributions of transplant oncology in hepato-biliary cancer 
(4-e). (1) evolutionary approach to cancer care that includes liver 
transplantation; (2) elucidation of self and non-self recognition systems, by 
linking tumor and transplant immunology; (3) exploration of innovative endpoints 
both in clinical and experimental settings taking advantage from the access to 
the entire liver explant; (4) extension of surgical limitation in the 
multidisciplinary approach to hepato-biliary oncology. The aim of this review is 
to define the principles of transplant oncology that may be applied to 
hepato-biliary cancer treatment and research, attempting to balance current 
evidences with future opportunities.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of restrictive strategy 
versus usual care in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A restrictive selection strategy for surgery in 
patients with gallstones reduces cholecystectomies, but the impact on overall 
costs and cost-effectiveness is unknown.
METHODS: Data of a multicentre, randomized-controlled trial (SECURE-trial) were 
used. Adult patients with gallstones and abdominal pain were included. 
Restrictive strategy was economically evaluated against usual care from a 
societal perspective. Hospital-use of resources was gathered with case-report 
forms and out-of-hospital consultations, out-of-pocket expenses, and 
productivity loss were collected with questionnaires. National unit costing was 
applied. The primary outcome was the cost per pain-free patient after 12 months.
RESULTS: All 1067 randomized patients (49.0 years, 73.7% females) were included. 
After 12 months, 56.2% of patients were pain-free in restrictive strategy versus 
59.8% after usual care. The restrictive strategy significantly reduced the 
cholecystectomy rate with 7.7% and reduced surgical costs with €160 per patient, 
€162 was saved from a societal perspective. The cost-effectiveness plane showed 
that restrictive strategy was cost saving in 89.1%, but resulted in less 
pain-free patients in 88.5%. Overall, the restrictive strategy saved €4563 from 
a societal perspective per pain-free patient lost.
CONCLUSIONS: A restrictive selection strategy for cholecystectomy saves €162 
compared to usual care, but results in fewer pain-free patients. The incremental 
cost per pain-free patient are savings of €4563 per pain-free patient lost. The 
higher societal willingness to pay for 1 extra pain-free patient, the lower the 
probability that the restrictive strategy will be cost-effective.
