BACKGROUND: Omalizumab (anti-IgE monoclonal antibody) is an approved add-on 
therapy for Japanese patients with severe allergic asthma. As directed by the 
Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Japan, a post-marketing surveillance (PMS) 
study on omalizumab was conducted between 2009 and 2017.
METHODS: The PMS observed safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients treated 
with open-label omalizumab for 52 weeks (with optional 2-year extension period). 
Primary safety outcomes included incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) 
and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Primary efficacy outcomes included 
physician-assessed global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE). 
Asthma-exacerbation-related events including requirement for additional systemic 
steroid therapy, hospitalization, emergency room visits, unscheduled doctor 
visits, and absenteeism were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 3893 patients registered, 3620 (age [mean ± SD] 59.3 ± 16.11 years) 
were evaluated for 52 weeks; 44.12% were aged ≥65 years and 64.45% were women. 
Overall, 32.24% reported AEs and 15.30% reported serious AEs. ADRs were seen in 
292 (8.07%) patients. GETE results showed that the majority of patients 
experienced clinical improvements (58.29% at 16 weeks and 62.40% at 52 weeks). 
Nearly half of all patients (47.96%) were free from asthma exacerbations after 
therapy. Omalizumab also reduced all events related to asthma exacerbations. No 
specific ADRs were observed in the elderly population.
CONCLUSIONS: This post-marketing study confirmed the clinically meaningful 
benefits of omalizumab in a majority of patients from Japan, and showed safety 
and efficacy in a real-life clinical setting to be consistent with previous 
reports.

Exceeded the Estimated Life Expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Hip osteoarthritis is a leading cause of functional decline and 
disability in the elderly. Although patients older than 80 years could 
significantly benefit from an elective total hip arthroplasty (THA), they pose a 
significant challenge to both anesthesiologist and arthroplasty surgeon. The 
purpose of this study was to report the clinical outcomes, complication rate, 
mortality, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of THA in patients who already 
exceeded the average life expectancy.
METHODS: Patients treated with elective THA for debilitating hip osteoarthritis 
and already exceeded the average life expectancy in Switzerland (n = 100) were 
included. The complication rate, QALY, and 30-day, 1-year, and midterm mortality 
were assessed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 12%. The 30-day and 1-year mortality 
was 3% and 6%, respectively. The Harris hip score increased significantly from 
an average of 50 preoperative to 93 points postoperative. Most of the patients 
(98%) had an improvement in the Harris hip score that was above the threshold 
for minimally significant change, whereas 75% reported an increase that exceeded 
the moderate improvement threshold. The average QALY was 4 years.
CONCLUSION: THA might be a safe and cost-effective procedure for improving pain, 
function, and quality of life with low mortality in selected elderly patients 
who already exceeded the average life expectancy. Hence, the arthroplasty 
surgeons should not hesitate to operate relatively active, independent, and 
cognitively intact elderly patients having debilitating hip osteoarthritis based 
only on the patient's age. Nevertheless, careful patient selection, surgical 
indications, and aggressive perioperative optimization might be necessary to 
minimize the risk of preoperative complications.

Sacubitril/Valsartan (LCZ696): A Novel Treatment for Heart Failure and its 
Estimated Cost Effectiveness, Budget Impact, and Disease Burden Reduction in 
Germany.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure affects over 1 million people in Germany and 
contributes to morbidity, mortality, and high healthcare costs. A recent large 
randomized controlled trial compared the novel compound sacubitril/valsartan 
(LCZ696) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and 
found a 16% reduction in mortality hazard. In Germany, sacubitril/valsartan was 
launched at the beginning of 2016.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a post hoc analysis of the 
cost effectiveness, budget impact, and disease burden reduction of 
sacubitril/valsartan compared with ACE inhibitors for patients with heart 
failure from the perspective of the German social health insurance (SHI), based 
on the results of this trial.
METHODS: A Markov (cohort) state transition model was constructed to simulate 
treatment over a remaining lifetime. Based on the Markov model, a dynamic 
population model was developed that projects the incidence, prevalence, 
mortality, and healthcare costs of heart failure in the SHI population from 2017 
to 2060. The population model follows prevalent and incident cohorts over time. 
Each year a new cohort is added, while the existing cohorts age by 1 year or 
die. To test for sensitivity of results, a Monte Carlo simulation was run.
RESULTS: Based on the price negotiated between manufacturer and representatives 
of the SHI, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
sacubitril/valsartan versus ACE inhibitors is €23,401 per life-year gained (in 
2018 Euros). At a price of zero, the cost-effectiveness ratio is already €9594 
per life-year gained due to high background costs of heart failure. Annual 
budget impact and reduction of disease burden reach a maximum at 4-8 years after 
launch (€221 million and 2.9%, respectively, in the base case).
CONCLUSIONS: The ICER of sacubitril/valsartan is projected to be at or below the 
level of other accepted interventions for the treatment of asymptomatic to 
severe heart failure in Germany. Projected budget impact leads to an increase in 
SHI expenditures by < 0.04% per year.

OBJECTIVE: The Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) trial showed 
that an intensive diet and exercise (D+E) program led to a mean 10.6-kg weight 
reduction and 51% pain reduction in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The 
aim of the current study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of adding 
this D+E program to treatment in overweight and obese (body mass index >27 kg/m2 
) patients with knee OA.
METHODS: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model to estimate quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and lifetime costs for overweight and obese patients with 
knee OA, with and without the D+E program. We evaluated cost-effectiveness with 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a ratio of the differences in 
lifetime cost and QALYs between treatment strategies. We considered 3 
cost-effectiveness thresholds: $50,000/QALY, $100,000/QALY, and $200,000/QALY. 
Analyses were conducted from health care sector and societal perspectives and 
used a lifetime horizon. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. D+E 
characteristics were derived from the IDEA trial. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were used to evaluate parameter 
uncertainty and the effect of extending the duration of the D+E program.
RESULTS: In the base case, D+E led to 0.054 QALYs gained per person and cost 
$1,845 from the health care sector perspective and $1,624 from the societal 
perspective. This resulted in ICERs of $34,100/QALY and $30,000/QALY. In the 
health care sector perspective PSA, D+E had 58% and 100% likelihoods of being 
cost-effective with thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Adding D+E to usual care for overweight and obese patients with knee 
OA is cost-effective and should be implemented in clinical practice.

Patents temporarily protect brand-name drugs from generic competition, but some 
of the 20-year patent term is used up before marketing approval. To compensate 
for patent life lost to clinical testing and regulatory review, current law 
provides patent term restoration (PTR) of up to 5 years. Examining 170 
top-selling drugs with a first generic equivalent approved between 2000 and 
2012, we found that 49% (83 drugs) received a PTR extension (median extension: 
2.75 years) yielding a median total exclusivity period of 13.75 years, compared 
with 10.0 years for the 87 nonextended drugs. Because PTR substantially prolongs 
market exclusivity periods, policies that extend non-patent exclusivity periods 
(which generally run concurrently with patent exclusivity) for less than the 
extended patent terms of drugs will have little practical impact.

BACKGROUND: In an effort to reduce overdiagnosis of low-risk thyroid cancer, 
recent clinical guidelines increased the size-based biopsy thresholds for 
thyroid nodules. The cost-effectiveness of these guidelines is largely unknown. 
We hypothesized that ultrasound surveillance in lieu of immediate fine needle 
aspiration biopsy would be cost effective for a 1.0 cm thyroid nodule with 
American Thyroid Association Intermediate Suspicion sonographic features.
METHODS: A Markov transition-state model was constructed to compare immediate 
fine needle aspiration versus ultrasound surveillance. Univariate and 
multivariate sensitivity analyses were used to examine the uncertainty of cost, 
probability, and utility estimates in the model.
RESULTS: Ultrasound surveillance was $1,829 less costly and 0.016 
quality-adjusted life years more effective than immediate fine needle 
aspiration. Immediate fine needle aspiration became cost effective when the 
probability of malignancy increased from 15% to 84% or the cost of ultrasound 
increased from $129 to $793. Immediate fine needle aspiration was cost-effective 
if the quality adjustment factor for observation following a benign fine needle 
aspiration result exceeded the quality adjustment factor for observation without 
a biopsy.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasound surveillance is more cost-effective than immediate fine 
needle aspiration for 1.0 cm thyroid nodules with an intermediate-suspicion 
sonographic pattern. Additional investigation of health-related quality of life 
in patients undergoing fine needle aspiration or surveillance is necessary.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Antagonists of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are effective for 
induction and maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease (CD) and are generally 
prescribed when patients do not respond to conventional, less-costly medical 
therapies. Early initiation of anti-TNF therapy reduced rates of surgery and 
dose escalation due to loss of response. However, these drugs are expensive, so 
studies are needed on the cost effectiveness of early initiation. We aimed to 
determine the cost effectiveness of initiating treatment early in the disease 
course (within 2 years of CD diagnosis) vs later in the disease course (more 
than 2 years after diagnosis).
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model of a hypothetical cohort of patients with 
CD in Canada to simulate disease progression after initiation of infliximab or 
adalimumab therapy. We used published loss-of-response rates to compare the 
lifetime cost effectiveness of early vs late initiation of anti-TNF therapies. 
Transition probabilities and utilities were obtained through a literature 
search, and costs were obtained from the Alberta Ministry of Health. Sensitivity 
analysis was used to characterize uncertainty.
RESULTS: Early initiation of infliximab yielded an additional 0.72 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and saved $50,418 compared with late 
initiation. Early initiation of adalimumab yielded an additional 0.54 QALYs and 
saved $43,969. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, early initiations 
of infliximab or adalimumab therapy had a 74% chance of being cost effective 
compared with late initiation.
CONCLUSIONS: In a Markov model analysis, we found initiation of either 
infliximab or adalimumab within 2 years of CD diagnosis to provide significant 
cost savings and QALYs compared with later initiation (more than 2 years after 
diagnosis).

BACKGROUND: It is known that episodes of microvascular obstruction and oxidative 
stress in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) can damage muscle tissue. As a consequence, 
deterioration in muscle function may potentially contribute to poor 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects with SCA, particularly those 
who do not use long-term treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate muscle function in adults with SCA, to study the 
correlations between muscle function and HRQoL and to analyse the impact of 
hydroxyurea treatment.
METHODS: Twenty-two adults with SCA and 20 matched controls were subjected to 
Short Form-36 (SF-36), respiratory muscle strength measurement, isometric hand 
grip strength (iHGS) measurement and knee isokinetic dynamometry.
RESULTS: In relation to their healthy peers, adults with SCA had lower SF-36 
scores, respiratory muscle strength and iHGS. Regarding the isokinetic test, 
adults with SCA showed lower values, especially in the variables measured in 
flexion and with an angular velocity of 240∘/s. There was a significant 
correlation between the peak torque (PT) at 240∘/s and the physical component 
summary (SF-36PCS) in both extension (r= 0.77; p< 0.001) and flexion (r= 0.82; 
p< 0.001). Significant correlations were also observed between the 
agonist/antagonist ratio at 240∘/s and the SF-36PCS (r= 0.50; p< 0.001). The use 
of hydroxyurea led to higher scores on the SF-36 and higher values in knee 
isokinetic dynamometry.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with SCA have muscle dysfunction, especially with regard to 
endurance of the knee flexor muscles. In these patients, there is a significant 
association between muscle function and HRQoL. Moreover, the use of hydroxyurea 
is associated with better HRQoL and less muscle dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: A third of deaths in the UK from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA) are in women. In men, national screening programmes reduce deaths from AAA 
and are cost-effective. The benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness in offering 
a similar programme to women have not been formally assessed, and this was the 
aim of this study.
METHODS: We developed a decision model to assess predefined outcomes of death 
caused by AAA, life years, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a population of women invited to AAA 
screening versus a population who were not invited to screening. A discrete 
event simulation model was set up for AAA screening, surveillance, and 
intervention. Relevant women-specific parameters were obtained from sources 
including systematic literature reviews, national registry or administrative 
databases, major AAA surgery trials, and UK National Health Service reference 
costs.
FINDINGS: AAA screening for women, as currently offered to UK men (at age 65 
years, with an AAA diagnosis at an aortic diameter of ≥3·0 cm, and elective 
repair considered at ≥5·5cm) gave, over 30 years, an estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £30 000 (95% CI 12 000-87 000) per quality-adjusted 
life year gained, with 3900 invitations to screening required to prevent one 
AAA-related death and an overdiagnosis rate of 33%. A modified option for women 
(screening at age 70 years, diagnosis at 2·5 cm and repair at 5·0 cm) was 
estimated to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £23 000 
(9500-71 000) per quality-adjusted life year and 1800 invitations to screening 
required to prevent one AAA-death, but an overdiagnosis rate of 55%. There was 
considerable uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness ratio, largely driven by 
uncertainty about AAA prevalence, the distribution of aortic sizes for women at 
different ages, and the effect of screening on quality of life.
INTERPRETATION: By UK standards, an AAA screening programme for women, designed 
to be similar to that used to screen men, is unlikely to be cost-effective. 
Further research on the aortic diameter distribution in women and potential 
quality of life decrements associated with screening are needed to assess the 
full benefits and harms of modified options.

Cyprus, via Mersin 10, Turkey.

The inflow of refugees from Syria into Lebanon necessitates a robust and 
efficient healthcare system in Lebanon to withstand the growing demand for 
healthcare service. For this purpose, we evaluate the efficiency of healthcare 
system in Lebanon from 2000 through 2015 by applying a modified data envelopment 
analysis (DEA) model. We have selected four output variables: life expectancy at 
birth, maternal mortality ratio, infant mortality rate, and newly infected with 
HIV and two input variables: total health expenditure (% of GDP) and number of 
hospital beds. The findings of the paper show improvement in the efficiency of 
the healthcare system in Lebanon after the widespread of the health system 
reform in 2005. It also shows that reduction in health expenditure does not 
necessarily reduce efficiency if operational and technical aspect of the 
healthcare system is improved. The study infers that the healthcare system in 
Lebanon is capable of withstanding the increase in health demand provided 
further resources are made available and the existing technical and operational 
improvement are maintained.

Lumbar spinal stenosis has been shown to negatively impact health-related 
quality of life. Interspinous process decompression (IPD) is a minimally 
invasive procedure that utilizes a stand-alone spacer to serve as a joint 
extension blocker to relieve neural compression in patients with spinal 
stenosis. Using the 5-year results from an FDA randomized controlled trial of 
IPD, the quality of life in 189 patients treated with the Superion® spacer was 
evaluated with the SF-12. Physical and mental component summary (PCS, MCS) 
scores were computed preoperatively and at annual intervals. For the PCS, mean 
scores improved from 29.4 ± 8.1 preoperatively to 41.2 ± 12.4 at 2 years (40%) 
and to 43.8 ± 11.6 at 5 years (49%) (p<0.001 for both comparisons). At 2 years, 
81% (103 of 128) of subjects demonstrated maintenance or improvement in PCS 
scores. The mean MCS score improved from 50.0 ± 12.7 preoperatively to 54.4 ± 
10.6 and 54.7 ± 8.6 at 2 and 5 years, respectively (p>0.10 for both 
comparisons). These results demonstrate that the significant impairment in 
physical well-being found in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis can be 
ameliorated, in large part, by IPD treatment.

Direct-acting antivirals approved for use in patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) now exist. HCV-positive (HCV+) ESRD patients have the opportunity 
to decrease the waiting times for transplantation by accepting HCV-infected 
kidneys. The optimal timing for HCV treatment (pre- vs posttransplant) among 
kidney transplant candidates is unknown. Monte Carlo microsimulation of 100 000 
candidates was used to examine the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment 
pretransplant vs posttransplant by liver fibrosis stage and waiting time over a 
lifetime time horizon using 2 regimens approved for ESRD patients. Treatment 
pretransplant yielded higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with 
posttransplant treatment in all subgroups except those with Meta-analysis of 
Histological Data in Viral Hepatitis stage F0 (pretransplant: 5.7 QALYs vs 
posttransplant: 5.8 QALYs). However, treatment posttransplant was cost-saving 
due to decreased dialysis duration with the use of HCV-infected kidneys 
(pretransplant: $735 700 vs posttransplant: $682 400). Using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000, treatment pretransplant was not 
cost-effective except for those with Meta-analysis of Histological Data in Viral 
Hepatitis stage F3 whose fibrosis progression was halted. If HCV+ candidates had 
access to HCV-infected donors and were transplanted ≥9 months sooner than 
HCV-negative candidates, treatment pretransplant was no longer cost-effective 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: $107 100). In conclusion, optimal 
timing of treatment depends on fibrosis stage and access to HCV+ kidneys but 
generally favors posttransplant HCV eradication.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have analyzed the benefit of limb amputations in 
children with metastatic osteosarcoma and limited life span.
OBJECTIVE: We studied outcomes of limb amputations in children with metastatic 
osteosarcoma.
DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent limb 
amputations (January 1995-June 2015) and died within 1 year of surgery.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We studied 12 patients with osteosarcoma at a single 
institution.
MEASUREMENTS: Data on mobility, pain, and emotional and psychological well-being 
were retrieved from medical records from 1 month before surgery to 6 months 
after surgery.
RESULTS: Of the 12 patients (7 females and 5 males; median age at surgery 13 
years [range, 7-20 years]) meeting study criteria, 3 patients and 9 patients had 
primary osteosarcoma in upper and lower limbs, respectively. Mobility improved 
postamputation in 8 bedridden/wheelchair-bound patients. Postamputation, 
emotional, and psychological well-being improved for 9 patients, 3 patients had 
persistent psychological and/or emotional symptoms, and no patient experienced 
signs of regret. Daily mean pain scores were significantly lower at 1 week 
(median 3 [range, 0-6]; P = .03) and 3 months (median 0 [range, 0-8]; P = .02) 
postsurgery than at 1 week presurgery (median 5.5 [range, 0-10]). Morphine 
consumption (mg/kg/d) showed a trend toward higher values at 1 week (median 0.2 
[range, 0-7.6]; P = .6) and 3 months (median 0.2 [range, 0-0.5]; P = .3) 
postsurgery than at 1 week presurgery (median 0.1 [range, 0-0.5]).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing limb amputations had reduced pain and improved 
mobility and emotional and psychological well-being. Amputations are likely to 
benefit children with limited life expectancy.

According to the position of the European Society of Hypertension in 2009, the 
thickening of the inner and middle membrane complex of the carotid arteries (I-M 
CCA), or the finding of atherosclerotic plaques is associated with high 
cardiovascular risk. The increase in I-M CCA thickness, assessed within the 
carotid artery, is considered the initial stage of atherosclerosis. According to 
the concept of parallel development of atherosclerosis in many arterial areas 
I-M CCA is a recognized marker of the process involving other arteries, such as 
coronary arteries, kidney or lower limbs.
AIM: The aim of the study was evaluation of the intima and media of carotid 
arteries - I-M in the course of hypertension in the elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 63 women and 17 men, aged from 75 to 
93 years, who were diagnosed with arterial hypertension in accordance with the 
guidelines of the Polish Society of Hypertension. Patients were divided into two 
groups. The first pair consisted of a group of 1 hypertensive patients (HA) 
lasting up to 10 years of age over 85 years and a group of 2 patients with HA 
lasting up to 10 years at the age of 75-85 years. The second pair is group I - 
patients with HA over 10 years of age over 85 years and group II - patients with 
HA lasting over 10 years at the age of 75-85. Carotid artery examination was 
performed using the Aloka SSD-1100 ultrasound machine. The measurements were 
made within the left and right carotid wall of the common carotid artery in the 
anterior and lateral-posterior projection. The maximum thickness of the inner 
and middle membranes was measured in three places within two segments of the 
common carotid artery.
RESULTS: It was observed that in the group of patients treated longer due to 
hypertension, the thickness of the intima-media complex is significantly higher 
than in patients with shorter duration. Moreover, in the examined group of 
patients in the analysis of individual correlations, life expectancy was 
influenced, among others, by significantly on the thickness of I-M CCA.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the older age of patients and the longer duration of 
hypertension caused thickening of the intima-media complex. The duration of 
hypertension greater than 10 years had a greater impact on the thickness of this 
complex than the age of the patients.

Cost-Effectiveness of a Pharmacogenetic Test to Guide Treatment for Major 
Depressive Disorder.

BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials indicate that pharmacogenetic-guided 
treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) results in higher treatment 
response rates by genetically matching patients to medications and avoiding a 
trial-and-error process.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic test (IDGx) 
that has demonstrated effectiveness compared with standard of care (SOC) 
medication management among patients with varied MDD severity.
METHODS: Data from a large prospective, randomized controlled trial of 
treatment-naive patients or patients with inadequately controlled MDD in general 
practice and psychiatric treatment settings were used to build a Markov 
state-transition probability model. Analyses were conducted from the societal 
perspective. Treatment response rates, mortality rates, direct and indirect 
medical costs, and utility inputs were derived from the reference study and 
published scientific literature. The cost of the pharmacogenetic test was 
$2,000. A 3% discount rate was used to discount costs and effects. Univariate 
one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of input 
parameters on net monetary benefit.
RESULTS: For moderate to severe MDD, the model estimated a cumulative effect 
over 3 years of 2.07 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the 
pharmacogenetic-guided treatment group and 1.97 QALYs for the SOC group, 
including a lower probability of death from suicide (0.328% and 0.351%, 
respectively). Total costs over 3 years were $44,697 (IDGx) and $47,295 (SOC). 
This difference includes a savings of $2,918 in direct medical costs and $1,680 
in indirect costs. Results were more pronounced when only severely depressed 
patients were evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetic testing among moderate to severe MDD patients 
improved QALYs and resulted in cost savings. Sensitivity analyses supported the 
robust nature of the current findings of the dominant IDGx test to guide 
treatment.

manufacturer of the IDgenetix test. AltheaDx personnel assisted in the study 
design, data collection, and review of the manuscript. Maciel and Garces are

Under chronic or severe liver injury, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) of biliary 
origin are known to expand and contribute to the regeneration of hepatocytes and 
cholangiocytes. This regeneration process is called ductular reaction (DR), 
which is accompanied by dynamic remodeling of biliary tissue. Although the DR 
shows apparently distinct mode of biliary extension depending on the type of 
liver injury, the key regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we 
show that Lutheran (Lu)/Basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) regulates the 
morphogenesis of DR depending on liver disease models. Lu+ and Lu- biliary cells 
isolated from injured liver exhibit opposite phenotypes in cell motility and 
duct formation capacities in vitro. By overexpression of Lu, Lu- biliary cells 
acquire the phenotype of Lu+ biliary cells. Lu-deficient mice showed severe 
defects in DR. Our findings reveal a critical role of Lu in the control of 
phenotypic heterogeneity of DR in distinct liver disease models.

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer, carries 
a life expectancy of 12-15 months. The short life expectancy is due in part to 
the inability of the current treatment, consisting of surgical resection 
followed by radiation and chemotherapy, to eliminate invasive tumor foci. 
Treatment of these foci may be improved with tumoricidal human mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs). MSCs exhibit potent tumor tropism and can be engineered to express 
therapeutic proteins that kill tumor cells. Advancements in preclinical models 
indicate that surgical resection induces premature MSC loss and reduces 
therapeutic efficacy. Efficacy of MSC treatment can be improved by seeding MSCs 
on a biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffold. MSC delivery into the 
surgical resection cavity on a PLA scaffold restores cell retention, 
persistence, and tumor killing. To study the effects of MSC-seeded PLA 
implantation on GBM, an accurate preclinical model is needed. Here we provide a 
preclinical surgical protocol for image-guided tumor resection of GBM in 
immune-deficient mice followed by MSC-seeded scaffold implantation. MSCs are 
engineered with lentiviral constructs to constitutively express and secrete 
therapeutic TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) as well as green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow fluorescent tracking. Similarly, the U87 
tumor cells are engineered to express mCherry and firefly luciferase, providing 
dual fluorescent/luminescent tracking. While currently used for investigating 
stem cell mediated delivery of therapeutics, this protocol could be modified to 
investigate the impact of surgical resection on other GBM interventions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological 
features of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 288 SPNs were analyzed.
RESULTS: Overall, 214 patients (74%) were female. Distant metastases occurred in 
4 patients, and splenic vein tumor thrombus occurred in 1 patient. Although 
imaging findings showed large (>2.0 cm) SPNs with clear, regular border, and 
heterogeneous internal structure, small SPNs appeared as almost entirely solid. 
Surgical resection was performed in 278 cases. The 5-year survival rate was 
98.8%. Six patients had tumor recurrence after the initial resection. The 
detection rate in typical pathological findings was low for small SPNs. Tumor 
extension to the pancreatic parenchyma was detected in greater than 70% of the 
cases. Tumor invasion to adjacent organs was detected in 13 cases. One was given 
a diagnosis of apparent high-grade malignant transformation.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of male cases was higher than that in previous 
studies, and there were statistically significant differences in the onset age 
and tumor diameter between male and female patients. Therefore, women seemed to 
have an early occurrence of SPNs, suggesting a difference in the developmental 
stage between men and women. Images and pathological findings of SPNs varied 
according to tumor size. Our findings indicated that SPN patients have excellent 
survival after margin-negative surgical resection.

In Germany, an estimated 19 000 people will develop pancreatic carcinoma in 
2018. The 5-year survival rate of all pancreatic carcinoma patients is very low 
at around 6 %, and the potentially curative operation is only possible in 
15 - 20 % of patients. More frequent use and combination of systemic 
chemotherapeutic agents has led to improved life expectancy in recent years. In 
this article we will summarize recent therapeutic strategies depending on tumor 
status and current approaches to personalized medicine in pancreatic carcinoma.

Publisher: EPIDEMIOLOGIE: In Deutschland werden im Jahr 2018 schätzungsweise 
19 000 Menschen an einem Pankreaskarzinom erkranken. Die 5-Jahres-Überlebensrate 
(5-JÜR) aller Pankreaskarzinompatienten liegt mit rund 6 % sehr niedrig und die 
potenziell kurative Operation ist nur bei 15 – 20 % der Erkrankten möglich. 
Durch häufigeren Einsatz und Kombination systemischer Chemotherapeutika konnte 
in den letzten Jahren eine verbesserte Lebenserwartung erreicht werden.
RESEKTABLES STADIUM: Nach vollständiger operativer Resektion eines 
Pankreaskarzinoms trägt eine adjuvante Chemotherapie zur Verlängerung des 
Gesamtüberlebens bei. Mittel der Wahl sind Gemcitabin oder 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 
und Folinsäure (FS). Kürzlich konnte für die Kombination aus Gemcitabin und 
Capecitabin (Gem-Cap) eine signifikante Verlängerung des Gesamtüberlebens im 
Vergleich zur Gemcitabin-Monotherapie gezeigt werden. Für den Einsatz einer 
adjuvanten Radiochemotherapie gibt es derzeit keine Empfehlung.
BORDERLINE-RESEKTABLES STADIUM: Eine neoadjuvante Therapie hat bei 
Pankreaskarzinomen außerhalb klinischer Studien keinen Stellenwert. Eine 
Ausnahme stellen borderline-resektable Pankreaskarzinome dar. FORTGESCHRITTENES 
STADIUM (M1):  Patienten mit fortgeschrittenem oder metastasiertem 
Pankreaskarzinom profitieren von einer Chemotherapie. Für Patienten mit gutem 
ECOG-Status konnte kürzlich in 2 Phase-III-Studien eine signifikante 
Lebenszeitverlängerung durch die Kombination aus Gemcitabin plus nab-Paclitaxel 
(Gem-Nab) sowie durch das Kombinationsschema aus Folinsäure, 5-FU, Irinotecan 
und Oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) gezeigt werden. In der Zweitlinie steht 
nanoliposomales Irinotecan oder Oxaliplatin kombiniert mit 5FU/FS (OFF) zur 
Verfügung.
PERSONALISIERTE THERAPIEN: Die molekulare Charakterisierung des 
Pankreaskarzinoms hat Fortschritte gemacht und bietet schon heute Ansätze zur 
personalisierten Medizin. Bei gutem ECOG-Status sollte vor Zweitlinientherapie 
eine MSI-H/dMMR-Analyse erfolgen, um den möglichen Einsatz einer 
Checkpoint-Inhibitor-Therapie zu evaluieren. Bei BRCA-Mutationen kann die Gabe 
von PARP-Inhibitoren vielversprechend sein.

The Formosa lily (Lilium formosanum) is one of the most common horticultural 
species in Taiwan. To explore gene regulation involved in this species, we used 
transcriptome analysis to generate PH-FB (mixed floral buds) and PH-LF (mature 
leaves) datasets. Combination of the PH-FB and PH-LF constructed a de novo 
assembly of the ALL dataset, including 18,041 contigs and 23,807 unigenes by Nr, 
GO, COG, and KEGG databases. The differential gene expression (DGE) analysis 
revealed 9937 genes were upregulated while 10,383 genes were downregulated in 
the developing floral buds compared to mature leaves. Seven putative genes 
(LFMADS1 to 7) encoding floral organ identity proteins were selected for further 
analysis. LFMADS1-6 genes were specifically expressed in the floral organ, while 
LFMADS7 in the floral buds and mature leaves. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that LFMADS1-3 is classified into B-class, LFMADS4 into C-class, LFMADS5 into 
D-class, and LFMADS6-7 into E-class, respectively. LFMADS-GFP fusion proteins 
appeared to localize in the nucleus, supporting their roles as transcription 
factors (TFs). Overexpression of the LFMADS2, LFMADS4, and LFMADS6 genes in 
Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering and floral defect, however, only early 
flowering in transgenic tobacco was observed. Highly expressed floral integrator 
genes, including AtFT, AtLFY, and AtFUL in transgenic Arabidopsis and NtFUL and 
NtSOC1 in transgenic tobacco, resulted in early flowering phenotype through 
qRT-PCR analysis. Yeast two-hybrid analysis suggested that LFMADSs may form 
higher order complexes with the B-, C-, D, and/or E-class proteins to determine 
the floral organ identity. Furthermore, E-class LFMADS proteins may function as 
a glue to mediate and strengthen the protein-protein interactions. Therefore, 
our de novo datasets would provide information for investigating other 
differentially expressed candidate transcripts. In addition, functional 
conservation of LFMADSs appears to be vital in floral transition and floral
