this observational study that no significant differences were found in the 
different male treatment groups. All female body composition parameters 
initially showed lower values (<3 years HAART). The female treatment group (>3 
years HAART) displayed values similar to that seen in the HAART-naïve group. 
Higher W:H ratios in females receiving longer-term HAART potentially increases 
their risk for the future onset of cardio-metabolic complications.

Hygiene, New York.

OBJECTIVE: New York City's (NYC's) life expectancy gains have been greater than 
those seen nationally. We examined life-expectancy changes over the past decade 
in selected NYC subpopulations and explored which age groups and causes of death 
contributed most to the increases.
METHODS: We calculated life expectancy with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
2001-2010 by sex and race/ethnicity. Life expectancy was decomposed by age group 
and cause of death. Logistic regressions were conducted to reinforce the results 
from decomposition by controlling confounders.
RESULTS: Overall, NYC residents' life expectancy at birth increased from 77.9 
years (95% CI, 77.8-78.0) in 2001 to 80.9 years (95% CI, 80.8-81.0) in 2010. 
Decreases in deaths from heart disease, cancer, and HIV disease accounted for 
50%, 16%, and 11%, respectively, of the gains. Decreased mortality in older age 
groups (≥65 years) accounted for 45.6% of the overall change.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy increased for both sexes, across all racial/ethnic 
groups, and for both the US-born and the foreign-born. Disparities in life 
expectancy decreased as overall life expectancy increased. Decreased mortality 
among older adults and from heart disease, cancer, and HIV infection accounted 
for most of the increases.

Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate the place and the usefulness of sedation in 
medical practice at the end of life.
RECENT FINDINGS: Continuous sedation is an acknowledged medical practice for the 
management of refractory symptoms at the end of life. Guidelines and 
recommendations have been proposed in palliative care. Although considered as a 
good medical practice at the end of life, sedation is neither the only option 
nor the best.
SUMMARY: This article presents the state-of-the-art (definitions, indications, 
and technical aspects) about continuous sedation, followed by an ethical 
reflection essentially based on the 'Principle of Double Effect', the impact on 
life expectancy, and the concept of 'natural death'.

BACKGROUND: Autophagy-related ATG6 proteins are pleiotropic proteins functioning 
in autophagy and the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-signaling pathways. 
Arabidopsis ATG6 regulates normal plant growth, pollen development and 
germination, and plant responses to biotic/abiotic stresses. However, the ATG6 
functions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), an important food crop, are lacking.
RESULTS: We identified three members, TaATG6a-6c, of the ATG6 family from common 
wheat. TaATG6a, 6b and 6c were localized on homeologous chromosomes 3DL, 3BL and 
3AL, respectively, of the allo-hexaploid wheat genome, and evidence was provided 
for their essential role in autophagy. The TaATG6a-GFP fusion protein was found 
in punctate pre-autophagosomal structures. The expression of each TaATG6 gene 
restored the accumulation of autophagic bodies in atg6-mutant yeast. 
Additionally, TaATG6 knockdown plants showed impaired constitutive and 
pathogen-induced autophagy and growth abnormalities under normal conditions. We 
also examined the expression patterns of wheat ATG6s for clues to their 
physiological roles, and found that their expression was induced by the fungus 
Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), the causal agent of powdery mildew, and 
by abiotic stress factors. A role for TaATG6s in wheat immunity to powdery 
mildew was further implied when knockdowns of TaATG6s weakly compromised the 
broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21-triggered resistance response 
and, conversely and significantly, enhanced the basal resistance of susceptible 
plants. In addition, leaf cell death was sometimes induced by growth-retarded 
small Bgt mycelia on susceptible TaATG6 knockdown plants after a long period of 
interaction. Thus, we provide an important extension of the previous 
characterization of plant ATG6 genes in wheat, and observed a role for autophagy 
genes in wheat immune responses to fungal pathogens.
CONCLUSIONS: Three wheat ATG6s were identified and shown to be essential for 
autophagy biogenesis. Wheat ATG6s are implicated in immunity to powdery mildew, 
playing a weak, positive role in the Pm21-triggered resistance response and a 
negative role in the basal resistance of susceptible plants.

BACKGROUND: With an increasing life expectancy and improved treatment regimens 
for primary or secondary malignant diseases of soft tissue or bone, 
hemipelvectomy will have to be considered more often in elderly patients in the 
future. Scientific reviews concerned with the surgical and oncological outcome 
of elderly patients undergoing hemipelvectomy are scarce. Therefore, it is the 
purpose of this study to review the outcome of patients treated with that 
procedure at our hospital and investigate the feasibility of such extensive 
procedures at an increased age.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of thirty-four patients who underwent 
hemipelvectomy at an age of 65 years or older was performed to determine their 
surgical and oncological outcome. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate 
the cumulative probability of survival using the day of tumor resection as a 
starting point. Univariate analysis was carried out to investigate the influence 
of a particular single parameter.
RESULTS: The mean age at operation was 70.2 years. Thirty patients were treated 
for intermediate- to high-grade sarcoma and 81.8% of tumors were larger than or 
equal to 10 cm in the longest diameter. Thirteen patients underwent internal 
hemipelvectomy and nine patients external hemipelvectomy as a primary procedure. 
Twelve patients were treated with external hemipelvectomy after failed local 
tumor control at primary operation. Wound infection occurred in 61.7% of cases. 
Three patients underwent amputation for non-manageable infection after internal 
hemipelvectomy. Hospital mortality was 8.8%. Clear resection margins were 
obtained in 88% of patients; in another 6% of patients planned intralesional 
resections were performed. Local recurrence occurred in 8.8% of patients at a 
mean time of 26 months after operation. Eleven patients are alive with no 
evidence of disease and 23 patients died of disease or other causes. Patients 
with pulmonary metastases had a mean survival period after operation to DOD of 
22 months compared to 37 months in the curative group.
CONCLUSION: Despite an elevated rate in hospital mortality and wound infection, 
this study suggests that hemipelvectomy is feasible in elderly patients, 
although requiring long hospitalization periods and causing a limited functional 
outcome.

BACKGROUND: Geriatric screening tools are increasingly implemented in daily 
practice, especially in the oncology setting, but also in primary care in some 
countries such as the Netherlands. Nonetheless, validation of these tools 
regarding their ability to predict relevant outcomes is lacking. In this study 
we evaluate if geriatric screening tools predict decline in functional status 
and quality of life after one year, in a population of older cancer patients and 
an older primary care population without cancer with a life expectancy of at 
least six months.
METHODS: Older cancer patients and a general older primary care population 
without a history of cancer (≥ 70 years) were included in an on-going 
prospective cohort study. Data were collected at baseline and after one-year 
follow-up. Functional decline was based on the Katz Index and Lawton IADL-scale 
and was defined as deterioration on one or more domains. Decline in quality of 
life was measured using the global health related subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30, 
and was defined as a decline ≥ 10 points. The selected geriatric screening tools 
were the abbreviated Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, Groningen Frailty 
Indicator, Vulnerable Elders Survey-13, and G8. We calculated sensitivity, 
specificity, predictive values, and odds ratios to assess if normal versus 
abnormal scores predict functional decline and decline in quality of life.
RESULTS: One-year follow-up data were available for 134 older cancer patients 
and 220 persons without cancer. Abnormal scores of all screening tools were 
significantly associated with functional decline. However, this was only true 
for older persons without cancer, and only in univariate analyses. For 
functional decline, sensitivity ranged from 54% to 71% and specificity from 33% 
to 66%. For decline in quality of life, sensitivity ranged from 40% to 67% and 
specificity from 37% to 54%.
CONCLUSION: In older persons with a relatively good prognosis, geriatric 
screening tools are of limited use in identifying persons at risk for decline in 
functional status or quality of life after one year. Hence, a geriatric 
screening tool cannot be relied on in isolation, but they do provide very 
valuable information and may prompt physicians to also consider different 
aspects of functioning.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for pancreatic and 
periampullary cancer, but many patients undergo unnecessary laparotomy because 
tumours can be understaged by computerised tomography (CT). A recent Cochrane 
review found diagnostic laparoscopy can decrease unnecessary laparotomy. We 
compared the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic laparoscopy prior to laparotomy 
versus direct laparotomy in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer 
with resectable disease based on CT scanning.
METHOD: Model based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the UK 
National Health Service. A decision tree model was constructed using 
probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken.
RESULTS: When laparotomy following diagnostic laparoscopy occurred in a 
subsequent admission, diagnostic laparoscopy incurred similar mean costs per 
patient to direct laparotomy (£7470 versus £7480); diagnostic laparoscopy costs 
(£995) were offset by avoiding unnecessary laparotomy costs. Diagnostic 
laparoscopy produced significantly more mean QALYs per patient than direct 
laparotomy (0.346 versus 0.337). Results were sensitive to the accuracy of 
diagnostic laparoscopy and the probability that disease was unresectable. 
Diagnostic laparoscopy had 63 to 66% probability of being cost-effective at a 
maximum willingness to pay for a QALY of £20 000 to £30 000. When laparotomy was 
undertaken in the same admission as diagnostic laparoscopy the mean cost per 
patient of diagnostic laparoscopy increased to £8224.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic laparoscopy prior to laparotomy in patients with 
CT-resectable cancer appears to be cost-effective in pancreatic cancer (but not 
in periampullary cancer), when laparotomy following diagnostic laparoscopy 
occurs in a subsequent admission.

In the long-term, with progression of the illness, Parkinson's disease dementia 
affects up to 90% of patients with Parkinson's disease. With increasing life 
expectancy in western countries, Parkinson's disease dementia is set to become 
even more prevalent in the future. However, current treatments only give modest 
symptomatic benefit at best. New treatments are slow in development because 
unlike the pathological processes underlying the motor deficits of Parkinson's 
disease, the neural mechanisms underlying the dementing process and its 
associated cognitive deficits are still poorly understood. Recent insights from 
neuroscience research have begun to unravel the heterogeneous involvement of 
several distinct neural networks underlying the cognitive deficits in 
Parkinson's disease dementia, and their modulation by both dopaminergic and 
non-dopaminergic transmitter systems in the brain. In this review we collate 
emerging evidence regarding these distinct brain networks to give a novel 
perspective on the pathological mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease 
dementia, and discuss how this may offer new therapeutic opportunities.

BACKGROUND: The way in which a government chooses to finance a health 
intervention can affect the uptake of health interventions and consequently the 
extent of health gains. In addition to health gains, some policies such as 
public finance can insure against catastrophic health expenditures. We aimed to 
evaluate the health and financial risk protection benefits of selected 
interventions that could be publicly financed by the government of Ethiopia.
METHODS: We used extended cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the health gains 
(deaths averted) and financial risk protection afforded (cases of poverty 
averted) by a bundle of nine (among many other) interventions that the 
Government of Ethiopia aims to make universally available. These nine 
interventions were measles vaccination, rotavirus vaccination, pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccination, diarrhoea treatment, malaria treatment, pneumonia 
treatment, caesarean section surgery, hypertension treatment, and tuberculosis 
treatment.
FINDINGS: Our analysis shows that, per dollar spent by the Ethiopian Government, 
the interventions that avert the most deaths are measles vaccination (367 deaths 
averted per $100,000 spent), pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (170 deaths 
averted per $100,000 spent), and caesarean section surgery (141 deaths averted 
per $100,000 spent). The interventions that avert the most cases of poverty are 
caesarean section surgery (98 cases averted per $100,000 spent), tuberculosis 
treatment (96 cases averted per $100,000 spent), and hypertension treatment (84 
cases averted per $100,000 spent).
INTERPRETATION: Our approach incorporates financial risk protection into the 
economic evaluation of health interventions and therefore provides information 
about the efficiency of attainment of both major objectives of a health system: 
improved health and financial risk protection. One intervention might rank 
higher on one or both metrics than another, which shows how intervention 
choice-the selection of a pathway to universal health coverage-might involve 
weighing up of sometimes competing objectives. This understanding can help 
policy makers to select interventions to target specific policy goals (ie, 
improved health or financial risk protection). It is especially relevant for the 
design and sequencing of universal health coverage to meet the needs of poor 
populations.

INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of this sub analysis of the CONOCES study 
was to analyse outcomes in terms of mortality rates, quality of life and degree 
of autonomy over the first year in patients admitted to stroke units in Spain. 
The secondary objective was to identify the factors determining good prognosis.
METHODS: We studied a sample of patients who had suffered a confirmed stroke and 
been admitted to a Stroke Unit in the Spanish healthcare system. 
Socio-demographic and clinical variables and variables related to the level of 
severity (NIHSS), the level of autonomy (Barthel, modified Rankin) and quality 
of life (EQ-5D) were recorded at the time of admission and then three months and 
one year after the event. Factors determining prognosis were analysed using 
logistic regression and ROC curves.
RESULTS: A total of 321 patients were recruited, 33% of whom received 
thrombolytic treatment, which was associated with better results on the Barthel 
and the modified Rankin scales and in terms of the risk of death. Mean quality 
of life measured through EQ-5D improved from 0.57 at discharge to 0.65 one year 
later. Full autonomy level measured by Barthel index increased from 30.1% at 
discharge to 52.8% at one year and by the modified Rankin scale from 51% to 71%. 
The rates for in-hospital and 1-year mortality were 5.9% and 17.4% respectively. 
Low NIHSS scores were associated with a good prognosis with all the outcome 
variables. The three instruments applied (NIHSS, Barthel and modified Rankin 
scales) on admission showed good discriminative ability for patient prognosis in 
the ROC curves.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been a change in the prognosis for stroke in Spain in 
recent years as the quality of life at 1 year observed in our study is clearly 
higher than that obtained in other Spanish studies conducted previously. 
Moreover, survival and functional outcome have also improved following the 
introduction of a new model of care. These results clearly promote extension of 
the model based on stroke units and reinforced rehabilitation to the majority of 
the more than 100,000 strokes that occur annually in Spain.

Laryngeal schwannomas are rare, benign neurogenic tumors. They normally present 
as a slow-growing, encapsulated, submucosal mass in the supraglottic region. We 
describe a 20-year-old female presenting with a 2-year history of hoarseness and 
progressive worsening dyspnea. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy and computed tomography 
revealed a round, low-density submucosal mass at right false cord and 
arytenoepiglottic regions with glottic extension. Microlaryngoscopic biopsy and 
debulking for this solid tumor were performed without tracheostomy. Schwannoma 
was confirmed by histopathological study. However, rapidly worsening stridor 
occurred 2 weeks after the surgery. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed an exophytic 
tumor occupying the right hemilarynx with airway compromise. Definite complete 
excision of the tumor was performed by right vertical hemilaryngectomy. At 
5-month follow-up, the laryngeal wound was clear without signs of recurrence. 
Rapid occurrence of airway obstruction after debulking and biopsy was 
demonstrated in this case. Vertical hemilaryngectomy was inevitable to cure this 
potentially life-threatening laryngeal schwannoma in this young female with 
postoperative serviceable voice.

BACKGROUND: Organisms, tissues and cells are genetically programmed to grow to a 
specific largely pre-set size and shape within the appropriate developmental 
timing. In the event of mutation, cell death, or tissue damage, the remaining 
cells may increase their rate of growth to compensate and generate an intact, 
potentially smaller, tissue or organism in order to achieve the desired size. A 
delay in the developmental timing could aid in this process. The insulin 
receptor signalling pathway with its central component, the Akt1 kinase, and 
endpoint regulator, the transcription factor foxo, plays a significant role in 
the control of growth. Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model organism 
with a well-studied life cycle and a consistently developing compound eye that 
can undergo analysis to compare changes in the properties of adult ommatidia as 
an indicator of growth.
FINDINGS: Imprecise excision of a PZ P-element inserted in the upstream region 
of Akt1 generated several novel hypomorphic alleles with internally deleted 
regions of the Pelement. These mutations lead to small, viable Drosophila that 
present with delays in development. Suppression of this phenotype by the 
directed expression of Akt1 (+) indicates that the phenotypes observed are Akt1 
dependent. Somatic clones of the eyes, consisting of homozygous tissue in 
otherwise heterozygous organisms that develop within a standard timeframe, 
signify that more severe phenotypes are masked by an extension in the time of 
development of homozygous mutants. Generation of Drosophila having the 
hypomorphic Akt1 alleles and a null allele of the downstream target foxo result 
in a phenotype very similar to that of the foxo mutant and do not resemble the 
Akt1 mutants.
CONCLUSION: The developmental delay of these novel Akt1 hypomorphs results in a 
latent phenotype uncovered by generation of somatic clones. The compensatory 
growth occurring during the extended time of development appears to be 
implemented through alteration of foxo activity. Production of clones is an 
effective and informative way to observe the effects of mutations that result in 
small, viable, developmentally delayed flies.

BACKGROUND: Few cost-utility studies of child and adolescent mental health 
services (CAMHS) use quality adjusted life years (a combination of utility 
weights and time in health state) as the outcome to enable comparison across 
disparate programs and modalities. Part of the solution to this problem involves 
embedding preference-based health-related quality of life (PBHRQOL) utility 
instruments, which generate utility weights, in clinical practice and research. 
The Child Health Utility (CHU9D) is a generic PBHRQOL instrument developed 
specifically for use in young people. The purpose of this study was to assess 
the suitability of the CHU9D as a routine outcome measure in CAMHS clinical 
practice.
METHODS: Two hundred caregivers of children receiving community mental health 
services completed the CHU9D alongside a standardised child and adolescent 
mental health measure (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - SDQ) 
during a telephone interview. We investigated face validity, practicality, 
internal consistency, and convergent validity of the CHU9D. In addition, we 
compared the utility weights obtained in this group with utility weights from 
other studies of child and adolescent mental health populations.
RESULTS: Participants found the CHU9D easy and quick to complete. It 
demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, and correlated moderately with the 
SDQ. It was able to discriminate between children in the abnormal range and 
those in the non-clinical/borderline range as measured by the SDQ. Three CHU9D 
items without corollaries in the SDQ (sleep, schoolwork, daily routine) were 
found to be significant predictors of the SDQ total score and may be useful 
clinical metrics. The mean utility weight of this sample was comparable with 
clinical subsamples from other CHU9D studies, but was significantly higher than 
mean utility weights noted in other child and adolescent mental health samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial validation suggests further investigation of the CHU9D as a 
routine outcome measure in CAMHS is warranted. Further investigation should 
explore test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, concordance between 
caregiver and child-completed forms, and the calibration of the utility weights. 
Differences between utility weights generated by the CHU9D and other utility 
instruments in this population should be further examined by administering a 
range of PBHRQOL instruments concurrently in a mental health group.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease (BoD) studies have been conducted in numerous 
international settings since the early 1990's. Two national BoD studies have 
been undertaken in Australia, in 1998 and 2003, although neither study estimated 
the BoD specifically for Indigenous Australians. In 2005 the Australian 
Government Department of Health and Ageing Office for Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Health formally commissioned the University of Queensland to 
undertake, in parallel with the second national BoD study, the "Burden of 
Disease and Injury in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples" study, 
drawing on available data up to 2003. This paper aims to explore the policy 
context and narrative in the lead up to commissioning the Indigenous BoD (IBoD) 
study, focusing on relevant contextual factors and insights regarding the 
perspectives of key stakeholders and their anticipated value of the study. It is 
part of a broader project that examines the uptake of evidence to policy, using 
the IBoD study as a case study.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken in late 2013 and 
early 2014, and the findings triangulated with 38 key informant interviews with 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous academics, researchers, statisticians, policy 
advisors, and policymakers, conducted between 2011 and 2013.
FINDINGS: Contextual features which led to commissioning the IBoD study included 
widespread recognition of longstanding Indigenous disadvantage, lower life 
expectancy than non-Indigenous Australians, and the lack of an adequate evidence 
base upon which to determine priorities for interventions. Several anticipated 
benefits and expectations of key stakeholders were identified. Most informants 
held at least one of the following expectations of the study: that it would 
inform the evidence base, contribute to priority setting, and/or inform policy. 
There were differing or entirely contrasting views to this however, with some 
sharing concerns about the study being undertaken at all.
CONCLUSIONS: The IBoD study, in concept, offered the potential to generate much 
desired 'answers', in the form of a quantified ranking of health risks and 
disease burden, and it was hoped by many that the results of the study would 
feed into determining priorities and informing Indigenous health policy.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the lacrimal gland is the most common primary 
malignant tumor of the lacrimal gland. It typically affects patients in the 
fifth decade of life and presents with rapid progression of pain, ptosis, 
motility disturbances, and sensory deficits of less than 1 year's duration. ACC 
is rare in children. Due to early, aggressive perineural and bony spread, there 
is a high risk of intracranial extension. Additionally, due to frequent 
hematogenous and lymphatic spread, there is a high rate of distant metastases 
even after treatment, which can occur late up to a decade or more. The currently 
accepted treatment for ACC is radical exenteration with orbitotomy and adjuvant 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Recently, intra-arterial cytoreductive 
chemotherapy (IACC) has been investigated as a neoadjuvant treatment modality. 
It has the advantage of increasing local concentration at the target tissue and 
decreasing systemic distribution. We report the first known pediatric case of 
ACC treated with IACC, followed by exenteration, radiation, and adjuvant 
intravenous chemotherapy. The patient was followed for 4 years, with no 
recurrence and no known complications.

Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin with or without pegylated 
interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in Italy.

Cure S(1), Guerra I, Cammà C, Craxì A, Carosi G.

OBJECTIVE: Across Italy up to 7.3% of the population is infected with hepatitis 
C virus (HCV), with long-term complications resulting in high medical costs and 
significant morbidity and mortality. Current treatment options have limitations 
due to side effects, interferon intolerability and ineligibility, long treatment 
durations and low sustained virological response (SVR) rates, especially for the 
most severe patients). Sofosbuvir is the first nucleotide polymerase inhibitor 
with pan-genotypic activity. Sofosbuvir, administered with ribavirin (RBV) and 
with or without pegylated interferon (PEG-INF), resulted in >90% SVR across 
treatment-naïve (TN) genotype (GT) 1-6 patients. It is also the first treatment 
option for patients that are unsuitable for interferon (UI). This analysis 
evaluates the cost - effectiveness of sofosbuvir for GTs 1-6 in Italy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model followed a cohort of 10,000 patients 
until they reached 80 years old. Approximately 20% of naïve and 30% of 
experienced patients initiated treatment at the cirrhosis stage. Comparators 
included PEG-INF + RBV for all GTs and plus telaprevir or boceprevir for GT1, or 
no treatment. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% and the cost perspective 
was that of the National Health Service in Italy.
RESULTS: Sofosbuvir was cost-effective with incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) below €40,000/QALY in all patient populations, particularly in 
cirrhotic patients. The exception was for a mixed cohort of GT2 TN patients 
where the ICER was €68,500/QALY and for a cirrhotic cohort of GT4/5/6 where the 
ICER was €68,434/QALY. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HCV in this patient 
population is expected to be low. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Sofosbuvir-based regimens are cost-effective in Italy, particular 
for the most severe patients. The interferon-free regimens are a real treatment 
option for UI patients. The high cure rates of this breakthrough treatment are 
expected to substantially reduce the burden of HCV in Italy.

BACKGROUND: Prostheses in the edentulous maxilla affect the mucosa.
PURPOSE: To evaluate mucosal alterations with implant supported fixed prostheses 
(FDP) and overdentures (IOD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients receiving prostheses during a time period of 10 
years were recruited. Maxillary mucosal conditions in relation to FDPs, IODs 
were analyzed. Peri-implant parameters were measured and the Oral Health Impact 
Profile (OHIP) was administered.
RESULTS: One hundred seven patients wearing 74 IODs and 33 FDPs were identified 
with a total of 519 implants, the mean observation time was 6.5 ± 2.7. 
Cumulative implant survival was 93%. Erythema and hyperplastic tissue were 
identified in 71% of the IOD wearers, but were mostly absent with FDPs. The 
peri-implant parameters demonstrated healthy peri-implant mucosa. Medication and 
smoking had no effect on mucosal alteration (OR = 1.065 and 1.568). The average 
OHIP value was 3.73 ± 4.12. A lower value (p < 0.0048) was found for FDPs and 
one type of IOD.
CONCLUSIONS: A rigorous maintenance program did not prevent IOD mucosal 
alterations in IOD wearers, but the health of the peri-implant mucosa was 
maintained and was comparable for all types of prostheses.

Follow-up of the neuro-urological patient: a systematic review.

Averbeck MA(1), Madersbacher H.

Author information:
(1)Department of Urology, Mae de Deus Center Hospital, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the long-term urological follow-up 
strategies for patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD), 
focusing on three main groups of neurological diseases: (i) spinal cord 
injuries, (ii) spinal dysraphism, and (iii) multiple sclerosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data acquisition comprised electronic search on the 
Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) database and 
the EMBASE database in August 2014 to retrieve English language studies. MEDLINE 
and EMBASE search included the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms: 
(i) neurogenic bladder and (ii) neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Each of these 
terms was crossed with (i) long-term care and (ii) long-term surveillance. Only 
studies related to NLUTD and urological follow-up were included. Studies were 
also identified by hand search of reference lists and review articles.
RESULTS: Initial records identified through database searching included 265 
articles. In all, 23 articles were included in the quantitative synthesis. The 
proposed time schedule of investigations as well as the amount and type of 
investigation were different according to specific neurological lesions. They 
depend on the dysfunctional pattern of the lower urinary tract (LUT) and its 
risk profile. However, there is a lack of high-evidence level studies to support 
an optimal long-term follow-up protocol.
CONCLUSIONS: The goal of neuro-urological management is the best possible 
preservation of upper urinary tract (UUT) and LUT function in relation to the 
individual neurological disorder. Regular and risk adapted controls 
('urochecks') allow detection of risk-factors in time before irreversible 
changes of the LUT and UUT have occurred. With risk- and patient-oriented 
lifelong regular urological care an optimised quality of life and 
life-expectancy can be achieved, although there is a complete lack of 
high-evidence level studies on this topic.

What is known about the cost-effectiveness of orphan drugs? Evidence from 
cost-utility analyses.

Belgium.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: In times of financial and economic hardship, 
governments are looking to contain pharmaceutical expenditure by focusing on 
cost-effective drugs. Because of their high prices and difficulties in 
demonstrating effectiveness in small patient populations, orphan drugs are often 
perceived as not able to meet traditional reimbursement threshold value for 
money. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the available 
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of orphan drugs.
METHODS: All orphan drugs listed as authorized on the website of the European 
Medicines Agency on 21 November 2013 were included in the analysis. Cost-utility 
analyses (CUAs) were identified by searching the Tufts Medical Center 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and Embase. For each CUA, a number of 
variables were collected.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The search identified 23 articles on the Tufts registry 
and 167 articles on Embase. The final analysis included 45 CUAs and 61 
incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) for 19 orphan drugs. Of all ICURS, 16·3% 
were related to dominant drugs (i.e. more effective and less expensive than the 
comparator), 70·5% were related to drugs that are more effective, but at a
