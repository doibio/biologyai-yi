BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, non communicable, 
multisystem disease that has reached epidemic proportions. Chronic exposure to 
hyperglycaemia affects the microvasculature, eventually leading to diabetic 
nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy with high impact on the quality of life 
and overall life expectancy. Sexual dysfunction is an often-overlooked 
microvascular complication of T2DM, with a complex pathogenesis originating from 
endothelial dysfunction.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to present current definitions, 
epidemiological data and risk factors for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, 
neuropathy and sexual dysfunction. We also describe the clinical and laboratory 
evaluation that is mandatory for the diagnosis of these conditions.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to identify data 
from clinical studies for the prevalence, risk factors and diagnostic methods of 
microvascular complications of T2DM.
RESULTS: Diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy affect approximately 25% of 
patients with T2DM; diabetic neuropathy is encountered in almost 50% of the 
diabetic population, while the prevalence of erectile dysfunction ranges from 
35-90% in diabetic men. The duration of T2DM along with glycemic, blood pressure 
and lipid control are common risk factors for the development of these 
complications. Criteria for the diagnosis of these conditions are well 
established, but exclusion of other causes is mandatory.
CONCLUSION: Early detection of microvascular complications associated with T2DM 
is important, as early intervention leads to better outcomes. However, this 
requires awareness of their definition, prevalence and diagnostic modalities.

Pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (PHAC) is one of the most aggressive 
malignancies, and it has low long-term survival rates. Surgery is the only 
option for long-term survival. The difficulties associated with PHAC include 
higher frequencies of regional or distant lymph node metastases and vascular 
involvement, and positive resection margins in pancreatic and retroperitoneal 
tissues. Radical resections increase margin negativity and life expectancy; 
however, the extend of the surgery applied is controversial. Thus, western and 
eastern centers may use different approaches. Multiorgan, peripancreatic nerve 
plexus, and vascular resections have been discussed in relation to radical 
surgery for pancreatic cancer as have the roles of neoadjuvant and adjuvant 
therapy regimens. Determining the appropriate limits for surgery, standardizing 
definitions and surgical techniques according to guidelines, and centralizing 
pancreatic surgery within high-volume institutions to reduce mortality and 
morbidity rates are among the most important issues to consider. In this review, 
we evaluate the basic concepts underlying and the roles of radical surgery for 
PHAC, and lymphadenectomy, nerve plexus, retroperitoneal tissue, vascular, and 
multivisceral resections, total pancreatectomy, and liver metastases are 
discussed.

Strawberry is a healthy fruit with numerous health-benefit compounds. 
Unfortunately, it is highly perishable and occasionally can be contaminated with 
foodborne pathogens. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate pulsed light 
(PL) processing for disinfection of strawberries, extension of shelf life, and 
preservation of quality attributes and compounds that are beneficial to health. 
Preliminary screening of PL conditions based on visual appearance of 
strawberries was conducted, and 3 PL treatments were identified for full 
evaluation. Salmonella inoculum was artificially deposited onto the skin of 
strawberries via spot-inoculation or dip-inoculation. The 3 PL treatments 
slightly reduced the level of inoculated Salmonella on strawberries, ranging 
from approximately 0.4 to 0.8 log reduction. They also slowed down the visible 
mold development on strawberries by 2 to 4 days compared with the untreated 
control. Regarding the natural yeasts and molds, the quality attributes (weight 
loss and firmness), and the bioactive compounds (total anthocyanin, total 
phenolics, and total antioxidant activity). The 3 PL treatment showed no 
significant or negligible difference comparing to the control group. Overall, 
the 3 PL treatments demonstrated potential in extending the shelf life of 
strawberries. The quality attributes or the bioactive compounds of strawberries 
showed no significant or minimal change after these PL treatments. PRACTICAL 
APPLICATION: Pulsed light (PL) processing for strawberry decontamination and 
shelf life extension was evaluated. Results demonstrated that PL processing 
could have the potency to improve strawberry shelf life without significantly 
affecting the quality and bioactive compounds of strawberries.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the association between 
education and incidence of accelerated cognitive decline.
METHODS: Secondary analyses of data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), 
a nationally representative prospective cohort study of U.S. residents were 
conducted (N = 28,417). Cox proportional hazards survival models were layered on 
longitudinal mixed-effects modeling to jointly examine healthy cognitive aging 
and incidence of accelerated cognitive decline consistent with patterns seen in 
preclinical Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Replication 
analyses were completed on a database including 62,485 additional respondents 
from HRS sister studies. Life expectancy ratios (LER) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were reported.
RESULTS: This study replicated research showing that education was positively 
associated with cognition at baseline. Model fit improved using the survival 
method compared to random-slopes models alone. Analyses of HRS data revealed 
that higher education was associated with delayed onset of accelerated cognitive 
decline (LER = 1.031 95% CI = [1.013-1.015], p < 1E-06). Replication analyses 
using data from 14 countries identified similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with cognitive reserve theory, 
suggesting that education reduces risk of ADRD-pattern cognitive decline. 
Follow-up work should seek to differentiate specific dementia types involved and 
consider potential mechanisms.

The level of response to sugar plays a role in many aspects of honey bee 
behavior including age dependent polyethism and division of labor. Bees may tune 
their sensitivity to sugars so that they maximize collection of high quality 
nectar, but they must also be able to collect from less profitable sources when 
high quality food is scarce. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by 
which bees can change their responsiveness to different sugars remains 
incomplete. To investigate the plasticity of sensitivity to sugar, bees were 
raised on different sugars either in vitro or in colonies. Bees raised in the 
incubator on diets containing mostly either fructose or glucose showed 
significantly more responsiveness to the majority sugar. In contrast, bees 
raised in colonies that only foraged on fructose or glucose responded equally 
well to both sugars. These data suggest that developmental plasticity for 
responses to sugar is masked by the feeding of worker jelly to larvae and young 
bees. The production of worker jelly from secretions of the hypopharyngeal and 
mandibular glands by nurse bees ensures that both glucose and fructose are 
experienced by young bees so that they respond to both sugars and will be able 
to exploit all future food sources.

It is well documented that diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins have 
strong genetic toxicity, cytotoxicity and oxidative damage to bivalve species. 
However, these toxic effects seem to decrease with the extension of exposure 
time and the increment of the toxin concentration, the mechanism involved 
remained unclear, though. In this paper, we found that expression of the genes 
related to cytoskeleton and Nrf2 signaling pathway displayed different changes 
over time in the gill of Perna viridis after exposure to DSP toxins-producing 
microalga Prorocentrum lima. During the short-term exposure (3 h and 6 h), KEAP1 
gene expression was significantly up-regulated, coupled with up-regulation of 
MRP, ABCB1 and CAT transcriptions and down-regulation of GPx1 and NQO1 mRNA. 
After longer exposure to high density of P. lima, Nrf2 was significantly 
up-regulated, accompanied with up-regulation of Nrf2 pathway related genes such 
as NQO1, SOD, GST-ω and ABCB1, whereas KEAP1 was down-regulated. TUBA1C and 
TUBB1 transcripts were significantly down-regulated after short-term exposure of 
P. lima, but both of them were up-regulated at 96 h after exposure to high 
density of P. lima. Paraffin section demonstrated that P. lima had a strong 
damage on the gill of mussels during the short-term exposure. However, the 
negative effect to the gill decreased, and the gill restored after longer 
exposure (96 h). Taking together, we proposed that P. lima had a negative impact 
on cytoskeleton of mussel gill tissue, could cause oxidative damage to the 
gills. However, longer exposure of P. lima in high density could activate Nrf2 
signaling pathway, thereby reducing the influence of toxin on mussel. Our study 
might provide a novel clue for the resistance mechanism of shellfish to DSP 
toxins.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Several studies have reported favorable oncosurgical 
outcomes after total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) for treatment of primary 
malignant tumors or oligometastatic tumors. Considering that TES is indicated 
for patients with longer life expectancy, long-term instrumentation-related 
issues such as rod fracture needs to be addressed.
PURPOSE: To investigate delayed rod fracture and related factors after TES.
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-two patients who survived for more than 2 years after 
TES.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Rod fracture and related factors.
METHODS: The relationships between rod fracture and related factors were 
investigated using Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis with log-rank test. The 
analyzed factors were sex, age (<60 or ≥60), tumor histology (primary or 
metastatic), location of resected tumor (thoracic [above T11], thoracolumbar 
[cases including T12-L1], or lumbar [below L2]), number of resected vertebrae 
(1, 2, or 3), anterior support method (expandable cage, mesh cage, or strut bone 
graft), rod diameter (5.5 mm or 6.0 mm), and history of radiotherapy including 
preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 18 men and 14 women, with a mean age 
of 49.0 years. Nineteen patients had primary tumors and 13 patients had 
metastatic tumors. The mean follow-up duration was 49.8 months (range, 24-166 
months). Twelve of 32 patients (37.5%) experienced rod fractures at an average 
of 29.2 months (range, 8-93 months) after TES. Of these 12 patients, 8 underwent 
revision surgery caused by back pain aggravation (n = 7) or nonunion on computed 
tomography scan (n = 4). Location of resected tumor and history of radiotherapy 
were significantly associated with rod fracture (p = .004 and p = .019, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Rod fracture was not a rare complication after TES surgery. History 
of radiotherapy and TES at lumbar level were significant risk factors related to 
rod fracture. A robust strategy to obtain solid osseous fusion should be 
considered when planning TES.

OBJECTIVE: As a result of continuously increasing life expectancy, the number of 
requests for surgery to treat degenerative diseases of the spine in the elderly 
population will increase. Since older age is associated with the occurrence of 
medical comorbidities, the demand for less extensive surgical approaches is 
growing. The aim of this study is to establish whether minimally invasive fusion 
techniques are a safe and adequate tool for use in elderly patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 187 patients who underwent minimally invasive 
surgery (MIS) in the form of one- to four-level fusion procedures. In 146 
patients, additional widening of the spinal canal was performed. The subjects 
were grouped into four age categories of approximately equal size (33-56, 56-66, 
66-74 and 74-85). The effect of age on the incidence of peri- and postoperative 
complications was investigated and compared between the age groups.
RESULTS: Older age was not associated with the occurrence of perioperative 
complications, which include wound healing disorders, hematomas, wound 
traction-blisters and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Fourteen patients (7.49%) 
encountered distinct surgical technique related complications, making surgical 
revision necessary in eight patients (4.28%). Furthermore, increasing age didn't 
elevate the risk of postoperative adverse events, i.e. pulmonary embolism, 
ischemic heart attack or pneumonia, among others. However, older patients were 
found to stay in hospital longer than younger patients, especially when more 
than one level was fused.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive surgery techniques are safe in elderly patients. 
The small-scale surgical approach guarantees a low incidence of infections and 
wound healing disorders. However, a longer hospital stay must be expected in 
older patients.

Pathways of standard genetic code evolution remain conserved and apparent, 
particularly upon analysis of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) lineages. Despite 
having incompatible active site folds, class I and class II aaRS are homologs by 
sequence. Specifically, structural class IA aaRS enzymes derive from class IIA 
aaRS enzymes by in-frame extension of the protein N-terminus and by an alternate 
fold nucleated by the N-terminal extension. The divergence of aaRS enzymes in 
the class I and class II clades was analyzed using the Phyre2 protein fold 
recognition server. The class I aaRS radiated from the class IA enzymes, and the 
class II aaRS radiated from the class IIA enzymes. The radiations of aaRS 
enzymes bolster the coevolution theory for evolution of the amino acids, 
tRNAomes, the genetic code, and aaRS enzymes and support a tRNA 
anticodon-centric perspective. We posit that second- and third-position tRNA 
anticodon sequence preference (C>(U~G)>A) powerfully selected the sectoring 
pathway for the code. GlyRS-IIA appears to have been the primordial aaRS from 
which all aaRS enzymes evolved, and glycine appears to have been the primordial 
amino acid around which the genetic code evolved.

BACKGROUND: Displaced femoral neck fractures (DFNF) are common and can be 
treated with osteosynthesis, hemiarthroplasty (HA), or total hip arthroplasty 
(THA). There is no consensus as to which intervention is superior in managing 
DFNF.
METHODS: Studies were identified through a systematic search of the MEDLINE 
database, EMBASE database, and Cochrane Controlled Trials. Included studies were 
randomized or controlled trials (1966 to August 2018) comparing THA with HA for 
the management of DFNF. (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO Identifier: 
CRD42018110057).
RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included totaling 1364 patients (660 THA and 704 
HA). THA was found to be superior to HA in terms of risk of reoperation, Harris 
Hip Score and Quality of Life (Short Form 36). Overall, the risk of dislocation 
was greater in THA group than HA in the first 4 years, after which there was no 
difference. There was no difference between THA and HA in terms of mortality or 
infection.
CONCLUSION: Overall, THA appears to be superior to HA. THA should be the 
recommended intervention for DFNF in patients with a life expectancy >4 years 
and in patients younger than 80 years. However, both HA and THA are reasonable 
interventions in patients older than 80 years and with shorter life expectancy.

The establishment of a lifelong latent infection after resolution of primary 
infection is a hallmark of cytomegalovirus (CMV) biology. Primary infection with 
human CMV is possible any time in life, but most frequently, virus transmission 
occurs already perinatally or in early childhood. Many years or even decades 
later, severe clinical problems can result from recurrence of infectious virus 
by reactivation from latency in individuals who undergo immunocompromising 
medical treatment, for instance, transplant recipients, but also in septic 
patients without canonical immunosuppression, and in elderly people with a 
weakened immune system. The diversity of disease manifestations, such as 
retinitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, gastrointestinal disease, and others, has 
remained an enigma. In clinical routine, seropositivity for IgG antibodies 
against human CMV is taken to indicate latent infection and thus to define a 
qualitative risk of recurrence, but it is insufficient as a predictor for the 
quantitative risk of recurrence. Early experimental studies in the mouse model, 
comparing primary infection of neonatal and adult mice, led to the hypothesis 
that high load of latent viral genomes is a better predictor for the 
quantitative risk. A prolonged period of virus multiplication in the 
immunologically immature neonatally infected host increased the risk of virus 
recurrence by an enhanced copy number of latent virus genomes from which 
reactivation can initiate. In extension of this hypothesis, one would predict 
today that a higher incidence of reactivation events will also fuel the 
expansion of virus-specific T cells observed in the elderly, a phenomenon known 
as "memory inflation". Notably, the mouse model also indicated a stochastic 
nature of reactivation, thus offering an explanation for the diversity and organ 
selectivity of disease manifestations observed in patients. As the infection 
history is mostly undefined in humans, such predictions from the mouse model are 
difficult to verify by clinical investigation, and moreover, such questions were 
actually rarely addressed. Here, we have surveyed the existing literature for 
reports that may help to retrospectively relate the individual infection history 
to the risk of virus recurrence and recrudescent organ disease.

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
capecitabine plus bevacizumab compared with capecitabine alone in elderly 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) from a Chinese societal 
perspective.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was conducted to simulate the process 
of metastatic CRC. Three distinct health states: progression-free survival 
(PFS), progressive disease and death were included. Clinical data were derived 
from the AVEX trial. Health effectiveness was denoted in quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and health utilities were derived from previously published 
studies. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was regarded as the primary 
endpoint and willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $26,753.37/QALY 
(3 × per capita GDP of China, 2017). One-way sensitivity analyses and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed to explore the parameters 
uncertainty in the study.
RESULTS: Over a 10-year life horizon, capecitabine plus bevacizumab gained 1.14 
QALYs at an average cost of $21,609.48, while the effectiveness and cost of 
capecitabine group were 0.99 QALYs and $7274.83, respectively. The ICER between 
the two groups was $95,564.33/QALY. Parameters that mostly influenced the 
results of the model were utility of PFS state, duration of PFS state for 
capecitabine plus bevacizumab, total cost of PFS state for capecitabine plus 
bevacizumab and price of bevacizumab. The probabilities of capecitabine plus 
bevacizumab and capecitabine as the dominant option were 0% and 100% at the WTP 
threshold of $26,753.37/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed that capecitabine plus bevacizumab 
is unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment option for elderly patients with 
metastatic CRC.

Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease may manifest as a 
metabolic disorder with pathology and/or dysfunction in numerous tissues. Adults 
with Alzheimer's disease suffer with significantly more comorbidities than 
demographically matched Medicare beneficiaries (Zhao et al, BMC Health Serv Res 
8:108, 2008b). Reciprocally, comorbid health conditions increase the risk of 
developing Alzheimer's disease (Haaksma et al, PLoS One 12(5):e0177044, 2017). 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is especially notable as the disease shares many 
overlapping pathologies observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease, including 
hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, 
dyslipidemia, inflammation, and cognitive dysfunction, as described in Chap. 8 
of this book (Yoshitake et al, Neurology 45(6):1161-1168, 1995; Leibson et al, 
Am J Epidemiol 145(4):301-308, 1997; Ott et al, Neurology 53(9):1937-1942, 1999; 
Voisin et al, Rev Med Interne 24(Suppl 3):288s-291s, 2003; Janson et al. 
Diabetes 53(2):474-481, 2004; Ristow M, J Mol Med (Berl) 82(8):510-529, 2004; 
Whitmer et al, BMJ 330(7504):1360, 2005, Curr Alzheimer Res 4(2):103-109, 2007; 
Ohara et al, Neurology 77(12):1126-1134, 2011). Although nondiabetic older 
adults also experience age-related cognitive decline, diabetes is uniquely 
associated with a twofold increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, as described in 
Chap. 2 of this book (Yoshitake et al, Neurology 45(6):1161-1168, 1995; Leibson 
et al, Am J Epidemiol 145(4):301-308, 1997; Ott et al. Neurology 
53(9):1937-1942, 1999; Ohara et al, Neurology 77(12):1126-1134, 2011). Good 
glycemic control has been shown to improve cognitive status (Cukierman-et al, 
Diabetes Care 32(2):221-226, 2009), and the use of insulin sensitizers is 
correlated with a lower rate of cognitive decline in older adults (Morris JK, 
Burns JM, Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep 12(5):520-527, 2012). At the molecular level, 
the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in 
maintaining energy homeostasis. Nutrient availability and cellular stress 
information, both extracellular and intracellular, are integrated and transduced 
through mTOR signaling pathways. Aberrant regulation of mTOR occurs in the 
brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and in numerous tissues of 
individuals with type 2 diabetes (Mannaa et al, J Mol Med (Berl) 
91(10):1167-1175, 2013). Moreover, modulating mTOR activity with a 
pharmacological inhibitor, rapamycin, provides wide-ranging health benefits, 
including healthy life span extension in numerous model organisms (Vellai et al, 
Nature 426(6967):620, 2003; Jia et al, Development 131(16):3897-3906, 2004; 
Kapahi et al, Curr Biol 14(10):885-890, 2004; Kaeberlein et al, Science 
310(5751):1193-1196, 2005; Powers et al, Genes Dev 20(2):174-184, 2006; Harrison 
et al, Nature 460(7253):392-395, 2009; Selman et al, Science 326(5949):140-144, 
2009; Sharp ZD, Strong R, J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 65(6):580-589, 2010), 
which underscores its importance to overall organismal health and longevity. In 
this chapter, we discuss the physiological role of mTOR signaling and the 
consequences of mTOR dysregulation in the brain and peripheral tissues, with 
emphasis on its relevance to the development of Alzheimer's disease and link to 
type 2 diabetes.

[Surgical procedures in patients with severe haemophilia 1997–2014].

[Article in Norwegian]

Andersen MF, Holme PA, Tjønnfjord GE.

BACKGROUND: As a result of good medical treatment, the life expectancy of 
patients with severe haemophilia is now approaching normal. This implies a 
growing need for treatment of lifestyle- and age-related disease. This article 
describes surgery in patients with severe haemophilia in the period 1997-2014.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data were retrieved from the registry linked to the 
national treatment service for surgery, intervention and advanced diagnostics 
for haemophilia. The patients were categorised according to type of haemophilia 
and type of intervention in orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic surgical procedures.
RESULTS: A total of 825 surgical procedures were undertaken in 286 patients. The 
number of procedures increased from 21 in 1997 to 66 in 2014. This increase was 
associated with non-orthopaedic interventions: altogether 4 such procedures were 
undertaken in 1997 and 45 in 2014. The number of orthopaedic interventions 
varied somewhat from year to year, but no clear trend was evident.
INTERPRETATION: With increased life expectancy, we are seeing a growing need for 
treatment of diseases that are not causally related to haemophilia. Doctors with 
little experience of patients with severe haemophilia will need to deal with 
lifestyle- and age-related disease in this patient group.

Energy transfer (ET) in photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioanalysis is usually 
generated between noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) and traditional inorganic 
quantum dots (QDs). Using the innovative polymer dot (Pdot)-involved ET, this 
work reports the first signal-on and cathodic PEC bioanalysis toward telomerase 
(TE) activity in cell extracts. Specifically, the sequential binding of capture 
DNA (cDNA), telomerase primer sequence (TS), and Au NP-labeled probe DNA (Au 
NP-pDNA) on the electrode would place the Au NPs in close proximity of the 
Pdots, leading to obvious quenching of the cathodic photocurrent. The subsequent 
extension of the TS by TE in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates 
(dNTPs) would then release the Ag NP-pDNA from the electrode, leading to the 
recovery of the photocurrent. On the basis of the Au NP-induced photocurrent 
quenching and the recovery of Pdots, a sensitive biosensor could thus be 
developed by tracking the photocurrents to probe the TE activity. This strategy 
allows for signal-on and cathodic PEC bioanalysis of TE, which can be easily 
extended for numerous other targets of interest. We believe this work could 
offer a new perspective for the rational implementation of Pdot-involved ET for 
advanced PEC bioanalysis.

Background: Providers often use birth plans to document parents' wishes for 
their fetus with a life-limiting condition. Objective: The objective of the 
study was to (1) discover important components of a birth plan for parents and 
providers who carry them out, and (2) understand the experience of parents and 
providers with birth plans. Methods: The study design involves mixed-methods, 
descriptive, exploratory survey. This involves parents (n = 20) of a pregnancy 
complicated by a life-limiting diagnosis and providers who care for them 
(n = 116). The approach involves descriptive and univariate analyses for 
quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results: 
Consistent components for families and physicians were diagnosis and medical 
management of the infant. Families gave greater emphasis on memory-making 
preferences. Parents feel birth plans give them a sense of control. Themes 
emerged from parents' experience of creating a birth plan are as follows: sense 
of control, therapeutic, memory making, effective communication, feeling 
prepared, and unexpected events. Most physicians feel comfortable discussing 
goals of care with families but report insufficient time. The importance of 
components of birth plans and perception of the parents' understanding of the 
prognosis varied by specialty. Discussion: Birth plans are beneficial and 
provide a greater sense of control for parents. Most physicians feel comfortable 
utilizing them. More than one-third of the physicians do not feel that they have 
time to complete a birth plan with parents. Communication between physicians and 
families about limitations of the plan and the potential trajectories could be 
improved. Communication between maternal and neonatal care providers regarding 
parent expectations and understanding could also be improved.

Increasing evidence suggests that signaling through the prolactin/prolactin 
receptor axis is important for stimulation the growth of many cancers including 
glioblastoma multiforme, breast and ovarian carcinoma. Efficient inhibitors of 
signaling have previously been developed but their applicability as cancer drugs 
is limited by the short in vivo half-life. In this study, we show that a fusion 
protein, consisting of the prolactin receptor antagonist PrlRA and an albumin 
binding domain for half-life extension can be expressed as inclusion bodies in 
Escherichia coli and efficiently refolded and purified to homogeneity. The 
fusion protein was found to have strong affinity for the two intended targets: 
the prolactin receptor (KD = 2.3±0.2 nM) and mouse serum albumin (KD = 0.38±0.01 
nM). Further investigation showed that it could efficiently prevent prolactin 
mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 at 100 nM concentration and above, similar to 
the PrlRA itself, suggesting a potential as drug for cancer therapy in the 
future. Complexion with HSA weakened the affinity for the receptor to 21±3 nM, 
however the ability to prevent phosphorylation of STAT5 was still prominent. 
Injection into rats showed a 100-fold higher concentration in blood after 24 h 
compared to PrlRA itself.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC] is usually associated 
with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. An increased risk of malignancies, mainly 
colorectal cancer [CRC] and cholangiocarcinoma [CCA], has been reported in 
PSC-IBD patients. Our aim was to determine the clinical characteristics and 
management of PSC in IBD patients, and the factors associated with malignancies.
METHODS: PSC-IBD patients were identified from the Spanish ENEIDA registry of 
GETECCU. Additional data were collected using the AEG-REDCap electronic data 
capture tool.
RESULTS: In total, 277 PSC-IBD patients were included, with an incidence rate of 
61 PSC cases per 100 000 IBD patient-years, 69.7% men, 67.5% ulcerative colitis 
and mean age at PSC diagnosis of 40 ± 16 years. Most patients [85.2%] were 
treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. Liver transplantation was required in 35 
patients [12.6%] after 79 months (interquartile range [IQR] 50-139). It was more 
common in intra- and extrahepatic PSC compared with small-duct PSC (16.3% vs 
3.3%; odds ratio [OR] 5.7: 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-19.3). The 
incidence rate of CRC since PSC diagnosis was 3.3 cases per 1000 patient-years 
[95% CI = 1.9-5.6]. Having symptoms of PSC at PSC diagnosis was the only factor 
related to an increased risk of CRC after IBD diagnosis [hazard ratio= 3.3: 95% 
CI = 1.1-9.9]. CCA was detected in seven patients [2.5%] with intra- and 
extrahepatic PSC, with median age of 42 years [IQR 39-53], and presented a lower 
life expectancy compared with patients without CCA and patients with or without 
CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: PSC-IBD patients with symptoms of PSC at PSC diagnosis have an 
increased risk of CRC. CCA was only diagnosed in patients with intra- and 
extrahepatic PSC and was associated with poor survival.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global pandemic, and 
contributes significantly to the increasing incidence of conditions such as 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Postprandial plasma glucose measured 2-h after the 
start of a meal is a good indicator of the overall status of glucose 
homeostasis. Clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.) and its essential oils (eugenol and 
acetyl eugenol) have been shown in preclinical studies to modulate pathways 
involved in glucose homeostasis. In addition, a water-soluble polyphenolic 
extract of unopened clove buds was recently shown to benefit liver function and 
redox status. Therefore, we conducted an open-label pilot study to test whether 
this polyphenolic clove extract (PCE) could influence glucose metabolism.
METHODS: We evaluated the effect of PCE supplementation (250 mg once daily for 
30 days) on preprandial glucose levels and 2-h postprandial glucose levels in 13 
otherwise healthy volunteers who were stratified into two groups according to 
their initial preprandial glucose levels: Group I (n = 7) ≤100 mg/dL, Group II 
(n = 6) - between 101 and 125 mg/dL. In an effort to elucidate the molecular 
mechanisms of PCE action, we tested in vitro the effects of PCE on glucose 
uptake, hepatocyte glucose production, and carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes.
RESULTS: At day 12 of supplementation, we observed statistically significant 
reductions in mean postprandial glucose levels in both groups [(Group I: Initial 
- Day 12 PPG = 13.29 mg/dL, 95% CI: 3.329-23.24) (Group II: Initial - Day 12 
PPG = 16.67 mg/dL, 95% CI: 4.687-28.65, P = 0.0159)], which continued through
