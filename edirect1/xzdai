[Prolia®; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA], raloxifene [Evista®; Daiichi 
Sankyo Company, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan], romosozumab [Evenity®; Union Chimique Belge 
(UCB) S.A. (Brussels, Belgium) and Amgen Inc.] and teriparatide [Forsteo®; Eli 
Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA]} are at preventing fractures, whether 
or not treatment has any risks for patients and whether or not the clinical 
benefits are achieved at a reasonable cost.
METHODS: We have systematically identified and examined trials that assessed the 
clinical effects of non-bisphosphonates. For each clinical outcome, we have 
combined data from multiple trials to estimate the clinical effectiveness of 
each non-bisphosphonate treatment. We combined data from published sources in an 
economic model to estimate lifetime costs and clinical benefits for each 
non-bisphosphonate and compared these with the estimated costs and clinical 
outcomes for untreated patients and patients treated with bisphosphonates.
RESULTS: All non-bisphosphonates reduced the risk of vertebral fractures 
compared with no treatment. For fractures at the hip or at any non-vertebral 
site, all of the non-bisphosphonates reduced the average number of fractures, 
but, for some non-bisphosphonates, we could not exclude the possibility that 
this was a chance finding. The chance of patients experiencing serious side 
effects was generally similar regardless of whether patients took 
non-bisphosphonates, bisphosphonates or placebo (a dummy pill). Blood clots were 
more common in patients taking raloxifene than in those taking placebo, but 
these were still a rare outcome (fewer than 1 in 100). The benefits of 
denosumab, teriparatide and romosozumab are few compared with their costs. For 
raloxifene, the risks generally outweigh the benefits. Treatment with 
bisphosphonates is likely to represent better value for money than treatment 
with non-bisphosphonates.

IMPORTANCE: Thyroid cancer is the most pervasive endocrine cancer worldwide. 
Studies examining the association between thyroid cancer and country, sex, age, 
sociodemographic index (SDI), and other factors are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the thyroid cancer burden and variation trends at the 
global, regional, and national levels using data on sex, age, and SDI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, epidemiologic 
data were gathered using the Global Health Data Exchange query tool, covering 
persons of all ages with thyroid cancer in 195 countries and 21 regions from 
January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2017; data analysis was completed on October 1, 
2019. All participants met the Global Burden of Disease Study inclusion 
criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included incidence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of thyroid cancer. Measures were 
stratified by sex, region, country, age, and SDI. The estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPCs) and age-standardized rates were calculated to 
evaluate the temporal trends.
RESULTS: Increases of thyroid cancer were noted in incident cases (169%), deaths 
(87%), and DALYs (75%). Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) showed an upward 
trend over time, with an EAPC of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.51-1.67); decreases were noted 
in EAPCs of age-standardized death rate (-0.15; 95% CI, -0.19 to -0.12) and 
age-standardized DALY rate (-0.11; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.08). Almost half (41.73% 
for incidence, 50.92% for deaths, and 54.39% for DALYs) of the thyroid cancer 
burden was noted in Southern and Eastern Asia. In addition, females accounted 
for most of the thyroid cancer burden (70.22% for incidence, 58.39% for deaths, 
and 58.68% for DALYs) and increased by years in this population, although the 
ASIR of males with thyroid cancer (EAPC, 2.18; 95% CI, 2.07-2.28) increased 
faster than that of females (EAPC, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.30-1.46). A third (34%) of 
patients with thyroid cancer resided in countries with a high SDI, and most 
patients were aged 50 to 69 years, which was older than the age in other 
quintiles (high SDI quintile compared with all other quintiles, P<.05). The most 
common age at onset of thyroid cancer worldwide was 15 to 49 years in female 
individuals compared with 50 to 69 years in male individuals (P<.05). Death from 
thyroid cancer was concentrated in participants aged 70 years or older and 
increased by years (average annual percentage change, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.21; 
P<.05). Furthermore, people in lower SDI quintiles developed thyroid cancer and 
died from it earlier than those in other quintiles (high and high-middle SDI vs 
low and low-middle SDI, P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Data from this study suggest considerable 
heterogeneity in the epidemiologic patterns of thyroid cancer across sex, age, 
SDI, region, and country, providing information for governments that may help 
improve national and local cancer control policies.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and 
led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff. An 
international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this 
practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for 
lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer 
radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed 
potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an 
early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered 
risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their 
increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of 
patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later 
pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring 
patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: 
peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative 
radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and 
prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic 
radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC.
RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to 
compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from 
guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement 
or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is 
generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an 
increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario 
characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important 
factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, 
life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations 
regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy 
are provided.
CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic 
and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of 
radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Health inequities stem from systematic, pervasive social and structural forces. 
These forces marginalize populations and create the circumstances that 
disadvantage these groups, as reflected in differences in outcomes like life 
expectancy and infant mortality and in inequitable access to and delivery of 
health care resources. To help eradicate these inequities, physicians must 
understand racism, sexism, oppression, historical marginalization, power, 
privilege, and other sociopolitical and economic forces that sustain and create 
inequities. A new educational paradigm emphasizing the knowledge, skills, and 
attitudes to achieve health equity is needed.Systems-based practice is the 
graduate medical education core competency that focuses on complex systems and 
physicians' roles within them; it includes topics like multidisciplinary 
team-based care, patient safety, cost containment, end-of-life goals, and 
quality improvement. This competency, however, is largely health care centric 
and does not train physicians to engage with the complexities of the social and 
structural determinants of health or to partner with systems and communities 
that are outside health care.The authors propose a new core competency centered 
on health equity, social responsibility, and structural competency to address 
this gap in graduate medical education. For the development of this new 
competency, the authors draw on existing, innovative undergraduate and graduate 
medical pedagogy and public health, health services research, and social 
medicine frameworks. They describe how this new competency would inform graduate 
medical education and clinical care and encourage future physicians to engage in 
the work of health equity.

Many publications on dementia start by outlining the current estimated number of 
people with dementia and how that figure is going to double (in Western 
societies) or even quadruple (in developing countries) in the coming decades as 
a result of increasing life expectancy (in itself a good development). Dementia 
is therefore a huge challenge to society, both in terms of providing good care 
for persons living with dementia and their family caregivers, as well as in 
searching for curative solutions. Both these challenges are complex. 
Fortunately, recent research indicates primary prevention to be a promising 
additional strategy in the dementia quest. Now that epidemiological research 
robustly shows the link between lifestyle and risk of dementia, new challenges 
emerge, such as how to increase public awareness about brain health, how to 
develop and implement strategies to promote brain healthy lifestyles and how to 
avoid increasing health inequalities. Interdem, the pan-European network of 
researchers on Psychosocial Interventions in Dementia, strongly welcomes this 
new strategy and consequently established a taskforce on primary prevention. In 
this position paper, we outline what we see as main building blocks of primary 
prevention of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness is a pivotal consideration for clinical decision 
making of high-tech cancer treatment in developing countries. 
Intensity-modulated proton radiation therapy (IMPT, the advanced form of proton 
beam therapy) has been found to improve the prognosis of the patients with 
paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers compared with intensity-modulated 
photon-radiation therapy (IMRT). However, the cost-effectiveness of IMPT has not 
yet been fully evaluated. This study aimed at evaluating the cost-effectiveness 
of IMPT versus IMRT for treatment decision making of paranasal sinus and nasal 
cavity cancers in Chinese settings.
METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was designed for cost-effectiveness analysis. A 
base case evaluation was performed on a patient of 47-year-old (median age of 
patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers in China). Model 
robustness was examined by probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Markov cohort 
analysis and Tornado diagram. Cost-effective scenarios of IMPT were further 
identified by one-way sensitivity analyses and stratified analyses were 
performed for different age levels. The outcome measure of the model was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A strategy was defined as 
cost-effective if the ICER was below the societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold of China (30,828 US dollars ($) / quality-adjusted life year (QALY)).
RESULTS: IMPT was identified as being cost-effective for the base case at the 
WTP of China, providing an extra 1.65 QALYs at an additional cost of $38,928.7 
compared with IMRT, and had an ICER of $23,611.2 / QALY. Of note, cost-effective 
scenarios of IMPT only existed in the following independent conditions: 
probability of IMPT eradicating cancer ≥0.867; probability of IMRT eradicating 
cancer ≤0.764; or cost of IMPT ≤ $52,163.9. Stratified analyses for different 
age levels demonstrated that IMPT was more cost-effective in younger patients 
than older patients, and was cost-effective only in patients ≤56-year-old.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite initially regarded as bearing high treatment cost, IMPT 
could still be cost-effective for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity 
cancers in China. The tumor control superiority of IMPT over IMRT and the 
patient's age should be the principal considerations for clinical decision of 
prescribing this new irradiation technique.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and net 
monetary benefit of olaparib maintenance therapy compared with no maintenance 
therapy after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in newly diagnosed advanced 
BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) 
perspective.
METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model in which a cohort of patients with 
newly diagnosed advanced BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer was assigned to receive 
either olaparib maintenance therapy or active surveillance (Italian standard of 
care) after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy to compare cost-effectiveness 
and net monetary benefit of the 2 strategies. Data on clinical outcomes were 
obtained from related clinical trial literature and extrapolated using 
parametric survival analyses. Data on costs were derived from Italian official 
sources and relevant real-world studies. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER), incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental net 
monetary benefit (INMB) were computed and compared against an incremental cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of €16,372 willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold. We used deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) to assess how uncertainty affects results; we also 
performed scenario analyses to compare results under different pricing settings.
FINDINGS: In the base-case scenario, during a 50-year time horizon, the total 
costs for patients treated with olaparib therapy and active surveillance were 
€124,359 and €97,043, respectively, and QALYs gained were 7.29 and 4.88, 
respectively, with an ICER of €9,515 per life-year gained, an ICUR of €11,345 
per QALY gained, and an INMB of €12,104. In scenario analyses, considering 
maximum selling prices for all other drugs, ICUR decreased to €11,311 per QALY 
and €7,498 per QALY when a 10% and 20% discount, respectively, was applied to 
the olaparib official price, and the INMB increased to €12,186 and €21,366, 
respectively. DSA found that the model results were most sensitive to the 
proportion of patients with relapsing disease in response to platinum-based 
chemotherapy, time receiving olaparib first-line maintenance treatment, and 
subsequent treatments price. According to PSAresults, olaparib was associated 
with a probability of being cost-effective at a €16,372 per QALY WTP threshold 
ranging from 70% to 100% in the scenarios examined.
IMPLICATIONS: Our analysis indicates that olaparib maintenance therapy may 
deliver a significant health benefit with a contained upfront cost during a 
50-year time horizon, from the Italian NHS perspective, providing value in a 
setting with curative intent.

Long-term stability is one of the most desired functionalities of energy storage 
microdevices for wearable electronics, wireless sensor networks and the upcoming 
Internet of Things. Although Li-ion microbatteries have become the dominant 
energy-storage technology for on-chip electronics, the extension of lifetime of 
these components remains a fundamental hurdle to overcome. Here, we develop an 
ultra-stable porous anode based on SnAu alloys able to withstand a high specific 
capacity exceeding 100 µAh cm-2 at 3 C rate for more than 6000 cycles of 
charge/discharge. Also, this new anode material exhibits low potential (0.2 V 
versus lithium) and one of the highest specific capacity ever reported at low 
C-rates (7.3 mAh cm-2 at 0.1 C). We show that the outstanding cyclability is the 
result of a combination of many factors, including limited volume expansion, as 
supported by density functional theory calculations. This finding opens new 
opportunities in design of long-lasting integrated energy storage for 
self-powered microsystems.

Increasing life expectancy and a growing share of older people around the world 
spotlight the issue of health during additional years of life. Research on 
trends of proportions of older people with activity limitations for low and 
middle income countries is sparse. We use data from the World Health Survey and 
the UN World Population Prospects to predict prevalence of activity limitations 
for 23 low and middle income countries for the upcoming 30 years. Our 
projections highlight huge variation in the proportion of older adults with 
limitations across investigated countries and this variation is not expected to 
diminish. However, these countries are facing considerable demographic changes 
and even though prevalence rates appear almost constant, absolute numbers are 
changing which require policy interventions. Furthermore, variations across 
countries reflect not only disparities in health conditions, but also 
differences in cultural peculiarities of reporting and historical perception of 
health.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic spinal lesions are diseases that impair the quality of 
life and require early diagnosis and treatment. The count of spinal metastasis 
patients rises day by day. Increased life expectancy has increased the incidence 
of cancer, making metastases more observable. The aim of our study was to 
investigate how the quality of life is affected in the patient group with 
vertebral fracture due to spinal metastases of multiple myeloma and undergoing 
vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with fracture due to spinal metastasis 
and adequate follow-up between the years of 2011 and 2018 were included in the 
study. Patients were listed according to their primary malignancy and 
metastases. The effect of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty was investigated by 
evaluating preoperative and postoperative VAS and Oswestry Disability Index 
scores. All patients' radiographic kyphosis angle, compression ratio and wedging 
index were calculated before operation and after operation.
RESULTS: A total of 76 vertebrae were operated in 42 patients. Significant 
differences were found in the comparison of preoperative and postoperative 
quality of life according to VAS and Oswestry Disability Index scores in the 
patients undergoing vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty or both procedures after spinal 
metastases (VAS; p = 0.0001, ODI; p = 0.002/0.0001). There were statistically 
significant differences in preoperative local kyphosis angle, compression ratio 
and wedging index and post-op local kyphosis angle, compression ratio and 
wedging index (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, minimally invasive procedures 
performed after spinal metastases, improve the quality of life of the patients.

PURPOSE: The removal of the ovaries for any reason causes surgical menopause. 
Hormonal changes that occur progressively over 5-10 years in natural menopause 
occur acutely in surgical menopause. Signs of estrogen deficiency appear 
suddenly and are permanent after this surgery. This study investigated the 
short- and long-term effects of estrogen deficiency occurring after surgical 
menopause on both nasal mucociliary activity and sinonasal symptoms.
METHODS: This prospective study included women aged 20-45 years who were not in 
the menopause, who had a planned bilateral oophorectomy and who attended the 
Gynecology Clinic at the Faculty of Medicine at a university hospital between 
January 2018 and December 2019. The nasal mucociliary clearance time, and blood 
Estradiol (E2) and FSH levels were measured once in the preoperative period, and 
at the postoperative 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th months. At the same times, the 
Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22) was also applied.
RESULTS:  The average age of the 47 patients was 41.2 ± 2.7. The mean serum 
estradiol levels of the women were 164.7 ± 63.4 pg/ml in the preoperative 
period, 14.8 ± 3.7 pg/ml at the postoperative 3rd month, 12.5 ± 3.5 pg/ml at the 
postoperative 6th month, 11.6 ± 3.0 pg/ml at the postoperative 9th month, and 
11.1 ± 2.7 pg/ml at the postoperative 12th month. The mean FSH levels of the 
women were 9.4 ± 2.4 mIU/ml in the preoperative period, 60.5 ± 9.6 mIU/ml at the 
postoperative 3rd month, 61.9 ± 9.4 mIU/ml at the postoperative 6th month, 
63.0 ± 9.3 mIU/ml at the postoperative 9th month, and 64.6 ± 8.7 mIU/ml at the 
postoperative 12th month. The changes in postoperative mean estradiol and FSH 
levels over a year were significant and consistent with menopausal symptoms 
(p < 0.001). The mean mucociliary clearance times were 12.6 ± 1.2 before 
menopause, 13.2 ± 1.7 at the postoperative 3rd month, 14.5 ± 1.7 at the 
postoperative 6th month, 17.5 ± 1.6 at the postoperative 9th month, and 
19.4 ± 1.9 at the postoperative 12th month. The extension of the mean 
mucociliary clearance time over 1 year was significant (p < 0.001). The mean 
scores for the SNOT-22 were 17.3 ± 6.9 before the operation, 17.8 ± 6.0 at the 
postoperative 3rd month, 19.6 ± 6.9 at the postoperative 6th month, 23.4 ± 10.4 
at the postoperative 9th month, and 36.1 ± 10.0 at the postoperative 12th month. 
The mean scores for rhinologic symptoms were 5.2 ± 1.9 (3-11) in the 
preoperative period, 5.7 ± 2.0 (3-12) at the postoperative 3rd month, 7.1 ± 2.3 
(4-14) at the postoperative 6th month, 9.3 ± 3.3 (4-16) at the postoperative 9th 
month, and 11.9 ± 3.3 (6-18) at the postoperative 12th month. The 1-year change 
in the SNOT-22 scores was found to be significant (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: After bilateral oophorectomy, menopausal hormonal values were 
acutely high in women. At the 1-year postmenopausal follow-up, the mean scores 
for the SNOT-22 had increased significantly. In other words, quality of life 
decreased in parallel with prolonged nasal mucociliary clearance time.

BACKGROUND: The TEACHH and Chow models were developed to predict life expectancy 
(LE) in patients evaluated for palliative radiotherapy (PRT). We sought to 
validate the TEACHH and Chow models in patients who died within 90 days of PRT 
consultation.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on patients evaluated for PRT from 
2017 to 2019 who died within 90 days of consultation. Data were collected for 
the TEACHH and Chow models; one point was assigned for each adverse factor. 
TEACHH model included: primary site of disease, ECOG performance status, age, 
prior palliative chemotherapy courses, hospitalization within the last 3 months, 
and presence of hepatic metastases; patients with 0-1, 2-4, and 5-6 adverse 
factors were categorized into groups (A, B, and C). The Chow model included 
non-breast primary, site of metastases other than bone only, and KPS; patients 
with 0-1, 2, or 3 adverse factors were categorized into groups (I, II, and III).
RESULTS: A total of 505 patients with a median overall survival of 2.1 months 
(IQR: 0.7-2.6) were identified. Based on the TEACHH model, 10 (2.0%), 387 
(76.6%), and 108 (21.4%) patients were predicted to live >1 year, >3 months to 
≤1 year, and ≤3 months, respectively. Utilizing the Chow model, 108 (21.4%), 250 
(49.5%), and 147 (29.1%) patients were expected to live 15.0, 6.5, and 
2.3 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Neither the TEACHH nor Chow model correctly predict prognosis in a 
patient population with a survival <3 months. A better predictive tool is 
required to identify patients with short LE.

Delirium is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with long-term 
cognitive decline. Due to the strong links between systemic inflammation, 
delirium and dementia we hypothesized that responses within the brain in 
patients who develop delirium could show biochemical overlap with patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this observational study we analyzed protein 
expression signatures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 15 patients with 
infectious delirium and compared these to 29 patients with AD, 30 infectious 
patients without delirium and 15 non-infectious controls free of neurological 
disease. A proximity extension assay was performed measuring a total of 184 
inflammatory and neurology-related proteins. Eight inflammatory proteins (4%), 
including the key neuron-microglia communication marker CX3CL1 (fractalkine), 
were significantly upregulated in both delirium and AD, compared to infectious 
patients without delirium. Likewise, 23 proteins (13%) showed downregulation in 
both delirium and AD, relative to infectious patients without delirium, which 
interestingly included CD200R1, another neuron-microglia communication marker, 
as well as a cluster of proteins related to synapse formation and function. 
Synaptopathy is an early event in AD and correlates strongly with cognitive 
dysfunction. These results were partially mediated by aging, which is an 
important predisposing risk factor among many others for both conditions. Within 
this study we report the first in vivo human evidence suggesting that synapse 
pathology and loss of homeostatic microglial control is involved in the 
pathophysiology of both infectious delirium and AD and thus may provide a link 
for the association between infections, delirium and long-term cognitive 
decline.

Standard cost-effectiveness models compare incremental cost increases to 
incremental average gains in health, commonly expressed in Quality-Adjusted Life 
Years (QALYs). Our research generalizes earlier models in several ways. We 
introduce risk aversion in Quality of Life (QoL), which leads to 
"willingness-to-pay" thresholds that rise with illness severity, potentially by 
an order of magnitude. Unlike traditional CEA analyses, which discriminate 
against persons with disabilities, our analysis implies that the marginal value 
of improving QoL rises for disabled individuals. Our model can also value the 
uncertain benefits of medical interventions by employing well-established 
analytic methods from finance. Finally, we show that traditional QALYs no longer 
serve as a single index of health, when consumers are risk-averse. To address 
this problem, we derive a generalized single-index of health outcomes-the 
Generalized Risk-Adjusted QALY (GRA-QALY). Earlier models of CEA that abstract 
from risk-aversion nest as special cases of our more general model.

Neurodegenerative diseases are a heterogeneous group of nervous system 
pathologies. They are found mainly in people of an older age group. The 
incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is continuously growing due to an 
increase in the average life expectancy of the population. At the moment, there 
are no effective and safe treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, which are 
most often diagnosed at the stage of decompensation, when therapy is ineffective 
and does not bring positive outcomes. Most of the currently used drugs act only 
symptomatically. The review provides analyzed data and information about the 
prospects of using peptide bioregulators as neuroprotectors with high 
physiological activity and low immunogenicity.

BACKGROUND: Health utilities express the perceptions patients have on the impact 
potential adverse events of medical treatments may have on their quality of 
life. Being able to accurately assess health utilities is crucial when deciding 
what is the best treatment when multiple and diverse treatment options exist, or 
when performing a cost / utility analysis. Due to the emotional and other 
complexities that may exist when such data are elicited, the values of the 
health utilities may be inaccurate and cause inconsistencies. Existing 
literature indicates that such inconsistencies may be very frequent. However, no 
method has been developed for dealing with such inconsistencies in an effective 
manner.
METHODS: Given a set of health utilities, this paper first explores ways for 
determining if there are any inconsistencies in their values. It also proposes a 
number of quadratic optimization approaches to best estimate the actual (and 
hence unknown) values when a set of initial health utility values are provided 
by the patient and certain inconsistencies have been detected. This is achieved 
by readjusting the initial values in a way that is minimal and also satisfies 
certain consistency requirements.
RESULTS: The proposed methods are applied on an illustrative example related to 
localized prostate cancer. Data from some published studies were used to 
illustrate how a set of initial values can be analyzed. This analysis aims at 
readjusting them in a minimal manner that would also satisfy some key numerical 
constraints pertinent to health utility values.
CONCLUSIONS: The numerical results and the computational complexities of the 
proposed models indicate that the proposed approaches are practical as they 
involve quadratic optimization modeling. These approaches are novel as the 
problem of addressing numerical inconsistencies in the elicitation process of 
health utilities has not been addressed adequately. The approaches are also 
critical in shared decision making and also when performing cost / utility 
analyses because health utilities play a central role in determining the 
quality-adjusted life years when making decisions in these healthcare domains.

BACKGROUND: Priority setting and resource allocation in health care, 
surveillance and interventions is based increasingly on burden of disease. 
Several methods exist to calculate the non-fatal burden of disease of burns 
expressed in years lived with disability (YLDs). The aim of this study was to 
assess the burden of disease due to burns in Western Australia 2011-2018 and 
compare YLD outcomes between three existing methods.
METHODS: Data from the Burns Service of Western Australia was used. Three 
existing methods to assess YLDs were compared: the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) method, a method dedicated to assess injury YLDs (Injury-VIBES), and a 
method dedicated to assess burns YLDs (INTEGRIS-burns).
RESULTS: Incidence data from 2,866 burn patients were used. Non-fatal burden of 
disease estimates differed substantially between the different methods. 
Estimates for 2011-2018 ranged between 610 and 1,085 YLDs per 100.000 based on 
the Injury-VIBES method; between 209 and 324 YLDs based on the INTEGRIS-burns 
method; and between 89 and 120 YLDs based on the GBD method. YLDs per case were 
three to nine times higher when the Injury-VIBES method was applied compared to 
the other methods. Also trends in time differed widely through application of 
the different methods. There was a strong increase in YLDs over the years when 
the Injury-VIBES method was applied, a slight increase when the INTEGRIS-burns 
method was applied and a stable pattern when the GBD method was applied.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the choice for a specific method heavily 
influences the non-fatal burden of disease expressed in YLDs, both in terms of 
annual estimates as well as in trends over time. By addressing the 
methodological limitations evident in previously published calculations of the 
non-fatal burden of disease, the INTEGRIS-burns seems to present a method to 
provide the most robust estimates to date, as it is the only method adapted to 
the nature of burn injuries and their recovery.

OBJECTIVE: Shortened life expectancy of people with mental disorders has been 
attributed to medical comorbidities, yet these conditions remain 
under-recognized and under-treated. This study characterizes the medical demands 
placed on inpatient psychiatric units to help guide medical assessment and
