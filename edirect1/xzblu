Riociguat is a soluble, guanylate cyclase stimulator, approved for pulmonary 
arterial hypertension. In the 12-week PATENT-1 study, riociguat was well 
tolerated and improved several clinically relevant end-points in patients with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension who were treatment naïve or had been pretreated 
with endothelin-receptor antagonists or prostanoids. The PATENT-2 open-label 
extension evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of riociguat. Eligible 
patients from the PATENT-1 study received riociguat individually adjusted up to 
a maximum dose of 2.5 mg three times daily. The primary objective was to assess 
the safety and tolerability of riociguat; exploratory efficacy assessments 
included 6-min walking distance and World Health Organization (WHO) functional 
class. Overall, 396 patients entered the PATENT-2 study and 324 (82%) were 
ongoing at this interim analysis (March 2013). The safety profile of riociguat 
in PATENT-2 was similar to that observed in PATENT-1, with cases of haemoptysis 
and pulmonary haemorrhage also being observed in PATENT-2. Improvements in the 
patients', 6-min walking distance and WHO functional class observed in PATENT-1 
persisted for up to 1 year in PATENT-2. In the observed population at the 1-year 
time point, mean±sd 6-min walking distance had changed by 51±74 m and WHO 
functional class had improved in 33%, stabilised in 61% and worsened in 6% of 
the patients versus the PATENT-1 baseline. Long-term riociguat was well 
tolerated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and led to sustained 
improvements in exercise capacity and functional capacity for up to 1 year.

    Eur Respir J. 2015 Jun;45(6):1521-3.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by 
failure of superoxide production in phagocytic cells. The disease is 
characterised by recurrent infections and inflammatory events, frequently 
affecting the lungs. Improvement of life expectancy now allows most patients to 
reach adulthood. We aimed to describe the pattern of pulmonary manifestations 
occurring during adulthood in CGD patients. This was a retrospective study of 
the French national cohort of adult patients (≥16 years old) with CGD. Medical 
data were obtained for 67 adult patients. Pulmonary manifestations affected 
two-thirds of adult patients. Their incidence was significantly higher than in 
childhood (mean annual rate 0.22 versus 0.07, p=0.01). Infectious risk persisted 
despite anti-infectious prophylaxis. Invasive fungal infections were frequent 
(0.11 per year per patient) and asymptomatic in 37% of the cases. They often 
required lung biopsy for diagnosis (10 out of 30). Noninfectious respiratory 
events concerned 28% of adult patients, frequently associated with a concomitant 
fungal infection (40%). They were more frequent in patients with the X-linked 
form of CGD. Immune-modulator therapies were required in most cases (70%). 
Respiratory manifestations are major complications of CGD in adulthood. 
Noninfectious pulmonary manifestations are as deleterious as infectious 
pneumonia. A specific respiratory monitoring is necessary.

A closer look at the role of healthcare in the recent mortality decline in the 
Netherlands: results of a record linkage study.

BACKGROUND: Since 2002, Dutch mortality rates decreased rapidly after decades of 
stagnation. On the basis of indirect evidence, previous research has suggested 
that this decline was due to a sudden expansion of healthcare. We tested two 
corollaries of this hypothesis--first, that the decline was concentrated among 
those with ill-health and second, that the decline can be statistically 
accounted for by increases in healthcare utilisation.
METHODS: We linked the Dutch health interview survey to the mortality register 
and constructed two cohorts, consisting of 7691 persons interviewed in 2001/2002 
and 8362 persons interviewed in 2007/2008, each with a 5-year mortality 
follow-up (659 deaths in total). The change in mortality between both cohorts 
was computed using Cox proportional hazard models. We estimated the change in 
mortality by severity of chronic conditions and with respect to the inclusion of 
indicators of healthcare utilisation.
RESULTS: Between the two study cohorts, mortality declined by 15% (95% CI 2% to 
29%), and mortality reduction was greatest for those suffering from fatal and 
non-fatal conditions with a decline of 58% (95% CI 35% to 78%). Even after 
adjustment for health status and risk factors, most indicators of healthcare 
utilisation were associated with higher instead of lower mortality and changes 
in healthcare utilisation did not explain the decline in mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results only partly confirm the hypothesis that an expansion of 
healthcare explains the recent mortality decline in the Netherlands. Owing to 
confounding by health status, it is difficult to reproduce the 
mortality-lowering effects of healthcare utilisation of individual level studies 
in the open population.

Radiation exposure from CT-guided ablation of renal masses: effects on life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to project the effects of radiation 
exposure on life expectancy (LE) in patients who opt for CT-guided 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) instead of surgery for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed a decision-analytic Markov model to compare 
LE losses attributable to radiation exposure in hypothetical 65-year-old 
patients who undergo CT-guided RFA versus surgery for small (≤ 4 cm) RCC. We 
incorporated mortality risks from RCC, radiation-induced cancers (for procedural 
and follow-up CT scans), and all other causes; institutional data informed the 
RFA procedural effective dose. Radiation-induced cancer risks were generated 
using an organ-specific approach. Effects of varying model parameters and of 
dose-reduction strategies were evaluated in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS. 
Cumulative RFA exposures (up to 305.2 mSv for one session plus surveillance) 
exceeded those from surgery (up to 87.2 mSv). In 65-year-old men, excess LE loss 
from radiation-induced cancers, comparing RFA to surgery, was 11.7 days (14.6 
days for RFA vs 2.9 days for surgery). Results varied with sex and age; this 
difference increased to 14.6 days in 65-year-old women and to 21.5 days in 
55-year-old men. Dose-reduction strategies that addressed follow-up rather than 
procedural exposure had a greater impact. In 65-year-old men, this difference 
decreased to 3.8 days if post-RFA follow-up scans were restricted to a single 
phase; even elimination of RFA procedural exposure could not achieve equivalent 
benefits. CONCLUSION. CT-guided RFA remains a safe alternative to surgery, but 
with decreasing age, the higher burden of radiation exposure merits explicit 
consideration. Dose-reduction strategies that target follow-up rather than 
procedural exposure will have a greater impact.

Netherlands.

AIM: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic dosing algorithm 
versus a clinical dosing algorithm for coumarin anticoagulants in The 
Netherlands.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was used to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetic dosing of phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol 
versus clinical dosing.
RESULTS: Pharmacogenetic dosing increased costs by €33 and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) by 0.001. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
€28,349 and €24,427 per QALY gained for phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol, 
respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY, the 
pharmacogenetic dosing algorithm was not likely to be cost effective compared 
with the clinical dosing algorithm.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetic dosing improves health only slightly when compared 
with clinical dosing. However, availability of low-cost genotyping would make it 
a cost-effective option.

BACKGROUND & METHODS: Economic evaluation in genomic medicine is an emerging 
discipline to assess the cost-effectiveness of genome-guided treatment. Here, we 
developed a pharmaco-economic model to assess whether pharmacogenomic 
(PGx)-guided warfarin treatment of elderly ischemic stroke patients with atrial 
fibrillation in Croatia is cost effective compared with non-PGx therapy. The 
time horizon of the model was set at 1 year.
RESULTS: Our primary analysis indicates that 97.07% (95% CI: 94.08-99.34%) of 
patients belonging to the PGx-guided group have not had any major complications, 
compared with the control group (89.12%; 95% CI: 84.00-93.87%, p < 0.05). The 
total cost per patient was estimated at €538.7 (95% CI: €526.3-551.2) for the 
PGx-guided group versus €219.7 (95% CI: €137.9-304.2) for the control group. In 
terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, total QALYs was estimated 
at 0.954 (95% CI: 0.943-0.964) and 0.944 (95% CI: 0.931-0.956) for the 
PGx-guided and the control groups, respectively. The true difference in QALYs 
was estimated at 0.01 (95% CI: 0.005-0.015) in favor of the PGx-guided group. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the PGx-guided versus the control 
groups was estimated at €31,225/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our data indicate that PGx-guided warfarin treatment may 
represent a cost-effective therapy option for the management of elderly patients 
with atrial fibrillation who developed ischemic stroke in Croatia.

This article explains key terms in demography and describes current and future 
changes in the composition of the German population. The ratio of older persons 
is greatly increasing as age groups from higher birth rates are growing older 
and as the life expectancy continues to rise particularly for older age groups. 
Ophthalmology is highly affected by these societal changes as eye diseases 
particularly affect the elderly. The prevalence of blindness and low vision is 
increasing in the older population even though this increase is being overlapped 
by a general reduction in the risk of blindness. Up to more than 30% more 
age-related eye diseases are expected in the population by the year 2030, which 
will lead to an additional roughly 7.7 million ophthalmic consultations in the 
population of more than 60 years of age. The healthcare units need to be 
adjusted to the rising demand for ophthalmic care.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there have been improvements in long-term 
survival after spinal cord injury in recent decades.
DESIGN: Survival analysis using time-varying covariates. The outcome variable 
was survival or mortality, and the explanatory variables were age, sex, level 
and grade of injury, and calendar year. The data were analyzed using the 
logistic regression model, Poisson regression model with comparison to the 
general population, and the computation of standardized mortality ratios for 
various groups.
SETTING: National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems facilities.
PARTICIPANTS: Persons (N=31,531) who survived 2 years postinjury, were older 
than 10 years, and who did not require ventilator support. These persons 
contributed 484,979 person-years of data, with 8536 deaths over the 1973 to 2012 
study period.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival; survival relative to the general population; 
life expectancy.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, race, etiology of injury, time since 
injury, and level and grade of injury, mortality in persons with spinal cord 
injury was higher in the 2005 to 2012 period than in 1990 to 2004 or 1980 to 
1989, the odds ratios for these 3 periods were .857, .826, and .802 as compared 
with the 1970 to 1979 reference period.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of improvement. Long-term survival has not 
changed over the past 30 years.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to estimate the expected cost-utility 
and cost-effectiveness of the ketogenic diet (KD), vague nerve stimulation (VNS) 
and care as usual (CAU), using a decision analytic model with a 5-year time 
horizon.
METHODS: A Markov decision analytical model was constructed to estimate the 
incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and successfully treated 
patient (i.e. 50% or more seizure reduction) of the treatment strategies KD, VNS 
and CAU, from a health care perspective. The base case considered children with 
intractable epilepsy (i.e. two or more antiepileptic drugs had failed) aged 
between 1 and 18 years. Data were derived from literature and expert meetings. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that KD is more effective and less costly, and thus 
cost-effective compared with VNS, after 12 months. However, compared to CAU, 
neither KD nor VNS are cost-effective options, they are both more effective but 
also more expensive (€346,899 and €641,068 per QALY, respectively). At 5 years, 
VNS is cost-effective compared with KD and CAU (€11,378 and €68,489 per QALY, 
respectively) and has a 51% probability of being cost-effective at a ceiling 
ratio of €80,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that on average the benefits of KD and VNS fail 
to outweigh the costs of the therapies. However, these treatment options should 
not be ignored in the treatment for intractable epilepsy in individual or 
specific groups of patients. There is a great need for high quality comparative 
studies with large patient samples which allow for subgroup analyses, long-term 
follow-up periods and outcome measures that measure effects beyond seizure 
frequency (e.g. quality of life). When this new evidence becomes available, 
reassessment of the cost-effectiveness of KD and VNS in children with 
intractable epilepsy should be carried out.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of treating prostate 
cancer patients with intensity-modulated radiation therapy and a spacer (IMRT+S) 
versus IMRT-only without a spacer (IMRT-O).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to 
examine the effect of late rectal toxicity and compare the costs and 
quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of IMRT-O and IMRT+S. The main assumption of 
this modeling study was that disease progression, genito-urinary toxicity and 
survival were equal for both comparators.
RESULTS: For all patients, IMRT+S revealed a lower toxicity than IMRT-O. 
Treatment follow-up and toxicity costs for IMRT-O and IMRT+S amounted to €1604 
and €1444, respectively, thus saving €160 on the complication costs at an extra 
charge of €1700 for the spacer in IMRT+S. The QALYs yielded for IMRT-O and 
IMRT+S were 3.542 and 3.570, respectively. This results in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €55,880 per QALY gained. For a ceiling ratio 
of €80,000, IMRT+S had a 77% probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: IMRT+S is cost-effective compared to IMRT-O based on its potential 
to reduce radiotherapy-related toxicity.

The Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Aflibercept in Combination with 
Irinotecan and Fluorouracil-Based Therapy (FOLFIRI) for the Treatment of

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer of aflibercept (Sanofi) to submit clinical and cost-effectiveness 
evidence for aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based 
therapy [irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI)] for the treatment of 
metastatic colorectal cancer which has progressed following prior 
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, as part of the Institute's Single Technology 
Appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for 
Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the 
independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of 
the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA307 
issued in March 2014. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the 
manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for 
which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The clinical effectiveness 
data were derived from one good-quality double-blind randomised controlled trial 
(RCT), the VELOUR trial, which compared aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with placebo 
plus FOLFIRI. This RCT found a small but statistically significant increase in 
overall survival (OS); the difference in median OS was 1.44 months (13.5 months 
in the aflibercept group and 12.06 months in the placebo group). There was also 
a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) with 
aflibercept; the difference in median PFS was 2.23 months (6.9 months in the 
aflibercept group and 4.67 months in the placebo group). However, grade 3-4 
adverse events were more frequent in the aflibercept group than the placebo 
group: 83.5% compared with 62.5%. Treatment-emergent adverse events led to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment in 26.8% of patients in the aflibercept 
group and 12.1% of patients in the placebo group. The manufacturer's submission 
included an estimation of mean OS benefit based on extrapolation of the data, 
which was considerably longer than the median OS benefit reported (4.7 vs. 1.44 
months). The ERG considered this to be an over estimate. The base-case 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the overall population was 
reported by the manufacturer to be £36,294 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY). After correcting the model programming and updating the model to include 
the ERG's preferred parameter estimates, the ICER from the ERG's alternative 
base case was £54,368 per QALY. The extrapolation of the OS curves was the key 
cost-effectiveness driver and a major source of uncertainty in the model. 
Additional scenarios related to the extrapolation of OS undertaken by the ERG 
resulted in ICERs between £62,894 and £92,089 per QALY. After consideration of 
the manufacturer's submission and the ERG's critique, and submissions from other 
stakeholders, the NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that aflibercept in 
combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy could not be 
considered a cost effective use of National Health Service resources for 
treating metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed 
after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Aflibercept in combination with 
irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy is not recommended for the treatment 
of metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed after an 
oxaliplatin-containing regimen in NICE guidance TA307.

Several recent lines of evidence are proving an important role for dopamine in 
the aging process and in the determination of life span. Components of the 
dopaminergic system may represent good candidates for longevity studies. Herein, 
we tested the possible association of the functional SLC6A3/DAT1 40-bp VNTR with 
life-expectancy in a healthy population of Central Italy (N = 993) by applying a 
genetic-demographic approach that takes into account the demographic information 
and different survival rates between sexes for modeling the survival of specific 
allele carriers in the population. Male carriers of S*/S* genotype showed a 
lower survival chance across most of the lifespan respect to the survival of 
DAT1*L-carriers (P = 0.021). The same analyses gave non-significant results in 
females. Several studies already reported significant sex differences in 
dopamine metabolism and its related biological pathways. Thus, we can 
hypothesize that the SLC6A3/DAT1 40 bp-VNTR may affect life expectancy in a 
sex-specific way. Moreover, it is conceivable that DAT1 S*/S* carriers, who are 
prone to assume "risk" type behaviors, may be dropped out of the "healthy" 
population by a sort of "demographic selection".

INTRODUCTION: Malnutrition is a common health problem, especially in 
hospitalized patients, where it's associated with longer hospital stays and 
higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, current scientific 
advances and life expectancy increase, have produced a progressive increase of 
mid- to long-term stay units (UMLE).
AIMS: To determinate the prevalence of malnutrition on admission to a mid- to 
long-term stay unit, using MNA and VGS and to analyze the possible 
factors/clinical features associated with malnutrition and its consequences.
METHODS: Descriptive and transversal study conducted with 201 patients admitted 
consecutively for 12 months in an Universitary Hospital mid- to long-term stay 
unit (Valencia). Clinical, anthropometric, biochemical and nutritional history 
data were registered, as well as Charlson comorbidity scale, Pfeiffer cognitive 
scale, Barthel functional scale and presence of edema, ascitis and pressure 
ulcers. Nutritional status was evaluated in the first 24-72 hours of admission 
using MNA and VGS. Dysphagia was evaluated using EAT-10 and MECV-V 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: The overall rate of malnutrition was 76,6%, being severe protein energy 
malnutrition the most common type (20,4%). Malnourished patients were older 
(p=0,002), presented greater dependence (p.

Publisher: Introducción: La desnutrición es un problema de salud frecuente, 
especialmente en el ámbito hospitalario donde se asocia con estancias más 
prolongadas y mayor tasa de morbi-mortalidad. Por otro lado, los avances 
científicos actuales y la mayor expectativa de vida, han producido un aumento 
progresivo de unidades de media y larga estancia (UMLE). Objetivos: Determinar 
la prevalencia de desnutrición en una UMLE mediante el uso del MNA y la VGS, así 
como analizar los factores/características clínicas asociadas a la misma y sus 
repercusiones. Métodos: Estudio transversal, descriptivo de una cohorte formada 
por 201 pacientes ingresados en la UMLE de un Hospital universitario de forma 
consecutiva durante 12 meses. Se recogieron variables clínicas, antropométricas, 
bioquímicas e historia nutricional, así como escala de comorbilidad de Charlson, 
escala cognitiva de Pfeiffer, escala funcional de Barthel y presencia de edemas, 
ascitis y úlceras por presión. El estado nutricional fue evaluado en las 
primeras 24-72 horas de ingreso mediante el MNA y la VGS. La presencia de 
disfagia se evaluó mediante el cuestionario EAT-10 y el MECV-V. Resultados: La 
prevalencia global de desnutrición fue del 76,6%, siendo la desnutrición mixta 
grave la más prevalente (20.4%). Los pacientes desnutridos tenían más edad

In recent years, substantial changes of the population structure have occurred, 
both at the national and international levels, due to several factors, including 
demographic changes and technological progress. At the same time, an 
epidemiological transition is occurring, characterized by a shift from diseases 
with an acute onset and a rapid resolution, to chronic-degenerative conditions 
which require more long-term care solutions. This shift seems to contribute to 
an increased life expectancy of the population, and a larger proportion of 
elderly individuals having complex health needs. The above described changes of 
the population structure, in combination with the current economic and financial 
crisis, require a redefinition of health system priorities at different levels, 
and the identification of specific intervention approaches. Today Primary Care 
is generally considered to have a key role in the progress of health systems and 
governments and international agencies, including the World Bank and the World 
Health Organisation have already increased investments and introduced reforms of 
Primary Care. However, there still remains much to be done, particularly with 
regards to the definition of specific aspects related to Primary Care. In this 
article the characteristics and developments of two main concepts, Primary Care 
(PC), which describes the delivery of Primary Care services, and Primary Health 
Care (PHC), which is more broadly defined by a level of governance or 
stewardship, are described. The distinction between PC and PHC implies the need 
for a characterization of system governance or stewardship, and of governance 
for care delivery. The first entails decision-making mechanisms for protecting 
the health both of individuals and of communities, by setting health, 
appropriateness and economic sustainability goals. These decisionmaking 
mechanisms further take into account the consequent responsibilities and risks 
compared to the achieved results toward citizens. The second relates to 
decision-making mechanisms for the delivery of services. Some examples are given 
of the application of system governance for primary healthcare at the national 
level and of characteristics of aggregations of professionals and/or structures 
for PC delivery. Finally, ideas and proposals for the development of an 
integrated approach for the delivery of Primary Care and prevention services, in 
a Public Health perspective are presented.

PURPOSE: To report our experiences reconstructing thumb and finger flexion in 
patients with extensive palsy of the upper limb by transferring the radial nerve 
branch to the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) to the anterior interosseous 
nerve (AIN).
METHODS: Within 8 months after injury, 4 patients with either a combined high 
median/ulnar nerve palsy or C7-T1 brachial plexus root avulsion underwent 
surgical reconstruction for thumb and finger flexion. As part of the 
reconstructive procedure, the branch of the radial nerve to the ECRB was 
transferred to the AIN.
RESULTS: At final evaluation, which averaged 13 months postoperatively, all 
patients had recovered full finger and thumb flexion, scoring M4 per Medical 
Research Council guidelines. Average grasp strength was 5 kg, and pinch strength 
was 2 kg. Even in anesthetic fingers and with their eyes closed, patients could 
correctly identify passive extension of their distal interphalangeal joints. 
Wrist extension was preserved in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In 4 patients, transfer of the branch of the radial nerve to the 
ECRB to the AIN predictably reconstructed thumb and finger flexion. Finger 
flexion also recovered in those fingers in which the flexor digitorum profundus 
was primarily innervated by the ulnar nerve. Despite extended sensory deficits, 
patients ultimately were able to use their hands regularly in daily life.

O'Neill's journey.

Mandelbaum G(1).

Author information:
(1)Former Associate Professor of English Literature and Humanities at Mercy 
College in New York, has taught extension courses on O'Neill's Long Day's 
Journey into Night and Strindberg's late plays at the New York Psychoanalytic 
Society, and is currently a Visiting Scholar at the William Alanson White 
Institute.

This paper considers some of the processes through which Eugene O'Neill 
(1888-1953) dramatically shaped his inner life and through which he created his 
plays. These processes at their finest are evident in his composition of Long 
Day's Journey into Night (1941a). During its 21-month composition, the play went 
through three different versions, as evidenced by the playwright's handwritten 
and typed materials (O'Neill, unpublished, a, b, c, d). This paper posits that 
each version reflects O'Neill's changing state of mind as he began to master his 
instinctual life, developing increasingly rich characters and creating a 
painful, deeply tragic vision. Thus, this paper shows that O'Neill's great 
artistic achievement reflected a great psychological one.

Cost-effectiveness of all-oral ledipasvir/sofosbuvir regimens in patients with 
chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection.

Falls Church, VA, USA.

BACKGROUND: An all-oral, pegylated interferon (pegIFN)-free and ribavirin 
(RBV)-free single-tablet of ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) is now 
approved for the treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
genotype 1.
AIM: To estimate the health economic outcomes for LDV/SOF compared with current 
treatments in US patients infected with HCV genotype 1.
METHODS: A hybrid decision-tree and Markov state-transition model was developed. 
For a cohort of 10,000 patients, the model captured outcomes for several 
pairings of LDV/SOF with comparators, including long-term health outcomes, 
number need to treat, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS) 
gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and costs per sustained virologic 
response (SVR). Patients with different levels of treatment experience and 
different cirrhosis stages were included.
RESULTS: LDV/SOF decreased the number of advanced liver disease cases by 0-93% 
compared with current regimens or no treatment in treatment-naïve patients. In 
treatment-experienced [pegIFN plus ribavirin (PR) or protease inhibitor (PI) + 
PR] patients, treatment with LDV/SOF decreased the incidence of advanced liver 
disease complications in most of the cases analysed, except SOF + SMV. For all 
patient sub-cohorts, LDV/SOF was associated with the lowest 1-year costs per SVR 
and, with regard to lifetime incremental costs per QALY gained, was either 
dominant or the most cost-effective treatment. Overall, treatment initiation at 
earlier stages of liver fibrosis resulted in improved health economic outcomes.
CONCLUSION: LDV/SOF is associated with more favourable short- and long-term 
health economic outcomes compared with current therapies for patients across all 
levels of treatment experience and cirrhosis stages.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable, chronic, fatal 
neuro-degenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of moto-neurons and 
paralysis of skeletal muscles. Reactivating dysfunctional areas is under earnest 
investigation utilizing various approaches. Here we present an innovative 
gene-cell construct aimed at reviving inert structure and function. Human 
umbilical cord blood cells (hUCBCs) transduced with adeno-viral vectors encoding 
human VEGF, GDNF and/or NCAM genes were transplanted into transgenic ALS mice 
models. Significant improvement in behavioral performance (open-field and 
grip-strength tests), as well as increased life-span was observed in rodents 
treated with NCAM-VEGF or NCAM-GDNF co-transfected cells. Active trans-gene 
expression was found in the spinal cord of ALS mice 10 weeks after delivering 
genetically modified hUCBCs, and cells were detectable even 5 months following 
transplantation. Our gene-cell therapy model yielded prominent symptomatic 
control and prolonged life-time in ALS. Incredible survivability of 
xeno-transpanted cells was also observed without any immune-suppression. These 
results suggest that engineered hUCBCs may offer effective gene-cell therapy in 
ALS.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to provide a clinician-friendly overview 
of decision-analytic models evaluating different treatment strategies for 
multiple myeloma (MM).
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify studies 
evaluating MM treatment strategies using mathematical decision-analytic models. 
We included studies that were published as full-text articles in English, and 
assessed relevant clinical endpoints, and summarized methodological 
characteristics (e.g., modeling approaches, simulation techniques, health 
outcomes, perspectives).
RESULTS: Eleven decision-analytic modeling studies met our inclusion criteria. 
Five different modeling approaches were adopted: decision-tree modeling, Markov 
state-transition modeling, discrete event simulation, partitioned-survival 
analysis and area-under-the-curve modeling. Health outcomes included survival, 
number-needed-to-treat, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life years. 
Evaluated treatment strategies included novel agent-based combination therapies, 
stem cell transplantation and supportive measures.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our review provides a comprehensive summary of modeling 
studies assessing treatment of MM and highlights decision-analytic modeling as 
an important tool for health policy decision making.
