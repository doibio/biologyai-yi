BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with perinatal 
health risks to both mother and offspring, and represents a large economic 
burden. The DALI study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, undertaken 
to add to the knowledge base on the effectiveness of interventions for pregnant 
women at increased risk for GDM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of the healthy eating and/or physical activity promotion 
intervention compared to usual care among pregnant women at increased risk of 
GDM from a societal perspective.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a European 
multicenter-randomized controlled trial. A total of 435 pregnant women at 
increased risk of GDM in primary and secondary care settings in nine European 
countries, were recruited and randomly allocated to a healthy eating and 
physical activity promotion intervention (HE + PA intervention), a healthy 
eating promotion intervention (HE intervention), or a physical activity 
promotion intervention (PA intervention). Main outcome measures were gestational 
weight gain, fasting glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and societal costs.
RESULTS: Between-group total cost and effect differences were not significant, 
besides significantly less gestational weight gain in the HE + PA group compared 
with the usual care group at 35-37 weeks (-2.3;95%CI:-3.7;-0.9). 
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the HE + PA intervention 
was the preferred intervention strategy. At 35-37 weeks, it depends on the 
decision-makers' willingness to pay per kilogram reduction in gestational weight 
gain whether the HE + PA intervention is cost-effective for gestational weight 
gain, whereas it was not cost-effective for fasting glucose and HOMA-IR. After 
delivery, the HE + PA intervention was cost-effective for QALYs, which was 
predominantly caused by a large reduction in delivery-related costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthy eating and physical activity promotion was found to be the 
preferred strategy for limiting gestational weight gain. As this intervention 
was cost-effective for QALYs after delivery, this study lends support for broad 
implementation.

OBJECTIVES: The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimated that 
low/middle-income countries will lose an estimated cumulative loss of 
US$12.3 trillion from gross domestic product (GDP) due to the unmet burden of 
surgical disease. However, no country-specific data currently exist. We aimed to 
estimate the costs to the Sierra Leone economy from death and disability which 
may have been averted by surgical care.
DESIGN: We used estimates of total, met and unmet need from two main sources-a 
cluster randomised, cross-sectional, countrywide survey and a retrospective, 
nationwide study on surgery in Sierra Leone. We calculated estimated 
disability-adjusted life years from morbidity and mortality for the estimated 
unmet burden and modelled the likely economic impact using three different 
methods-gross national income per capita, lifetime earnings foregone and value 
of a statistical life.
RESULTS: In 2012, estimated, discounted lifetime losses to the Sierra Leone 
economy from the unmet burden of surgical disease was between US$1.1 and 
US$3.8 billion, depending on the economic method used. These lifetime losses 
equate to between 23% and 100% of the annual GDP for Sierra Leone. 80% of 
economic losses were due to mortality. The incremental losses averted by scale 
up of surgical provision to the Lancet Commission target of 80% were calculated 
to be between US$360 million and US$2.9 billion.
CONCLUSION: There is a large economic loss from the unmet need for surgical care 
in Sierra Leone. There is an immediate need for massive investment to counteract 
ongoing economic losses.

INTRODUCTION: Hip and knee replacement represents a significant burden to the UK 
healthcare system. 'Enhanced recovery' pathways have been introduced in the 
National Health Service (NHS) for patients undergoing hip and knee replacement, 
with the aim of improving outcomes and timely recovery after surgery. To support 
policymaking, there is a need to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enhanced 
recovery pathways across jurisdictions. Our aim is to systematically summarise 
the published cost-effectiveness evidence on enhanced recovery in hip and knee 
replacement, both as a whole and for each of the various components of enhanced 
recovery pathways.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will be conducted using MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, Econlit and the National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database. 
Separate search strategies were developed for each database including terms 
relating to hip and knee replacement/arthroplasty, economic evaluations, 
decision modelling and quality of life measures.We will extract peer-reviewed 
studies published between 2000 and 2017 reporting economic evaluations of 
preoperative, perioperative or postoperative enhanced recovery interventions 
within hip or knee replacement. Economic evaluations alongside cohort studies or 
based on decision models will be included. Only studies with patients undergoing 
elective replacement surgery of the hip or knee will be included. Data will be 
extracted using a predefined pro forma following best practice guidelines for 
economic evaluation, decision modelling and model validation.Our primary outcome 
will be the cost-effectiveness of enhanced recovery (entire pathway and 
individual components) in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life 
year. A narrative synthesis of all studies will be presented, focussing on 
cost-effectiveness results, study design, quality and validation status.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review is exempted from ethics 
approval because the work is carried out on published documents. The results of 
the review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed academic journal and at 
conferences.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has infected > 60 million people since its 
discovery and 30 million people have died since the pandemic began. 
Antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV infection from an acute to a chronic 
disease, increasing life expectancy but also adding to the potential side 
effects associated with drug therapy and the comorbidity accompanying longevity. 
Exercise can play a valuable role in the management of HIV/AIDS patients by 
addressing various symptoms and improving their quality of life, but the optimum 
mode, intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that take the different 
clinical stages of the disease into consideration are inadequately known. 
Searches of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, CINAHL database, 
HealthSTAR, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Physiotherapy Evidence Database 
(PEDro), and SPORTDiscus were conducted between 2000 and January 2014. Searches 
of published and unpublished abstracts were conducted, as well as a hand search 
of reference lists and tables of contents of relevant journals and books. 
Identified studies were reviewed for methodological quality. A total of 33 
studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies failed to indicate the optimum 
type (mode), intensity, frequency, and duration of aerobic and progressive 
resistive exercise prescribed to HIV-infected individuals in relation to the 
different clinical stages of the disease. The purpose of this review is to 
provide evidence-based recommendations after revision of exercise guidelines for 
HIV patients, by highlighting practical guidelines that clinical exercise 
therapists should consider when prescribing exercise for patients in different 
stages of the disease.

Continuous Monitoring of Glucose for Type 1 Diabetes: A Health Technology 
Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Vandersluis S, Kabali C, Djalalov S, Gajic-Veljanoski O, Wells D, 
Holubowich C.

BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which the pancreas produces little 
or no insulin. People with type 1 diabetes must manage their blood glucose 
levels by monitoring the amount of glucose in their blood and administering 
appropriate amounts of insulin via injection or an insulin pump. Continuous 
glucose monitoring may be beneficial compared to self-monitoring of blood 
glucose using a blood glucose meter. It provides insight into a person's blood 
glucose levels on a continuous basis, and can identify whether blood glucose 
levels are trending up or down.
METHODS: We conducted a health technology assessment, which included an 
evaluation of clinical benefit, value for money, and patient preferences related 
to continuous glucose monitoring. We compared continuous glucose monitoring with 
self-monitoring of blood glucose using a finger-prick and a blood glucose meter. 
We performed a systematic literature search for studies published since January 
1, 2010. We created a Markov model projecting the lifetime horizon of adults 
with type 1 diabetes, and performed a budget impact analysis from the 
perspective of the health care payer. We also conducted interviews and focus 
group discussions with people who self-manage their type 1 diabetes or support 
the management of a child with type 1 diabetes.
RESULTS: Twenty studies were included in the clinical evidence review. Compared 
with self-monitoring of blood glucose, continuous glucose monitoring improved 
the percentage of time patients spent in the target glycemic range by 9.6% (95% 
confidence interval 8.0-11.2) to 10.0% (95% confidence interval 6.75-13.25) and 
decreased the number of severe hypoglycemic events.Continuous glucose monitoring 
was associated with higher costs and small increases in health benefits 
(quality-adjusted life-years). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
ranged from $592,206 to $1,108,812 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in 
analyses comparing four continuous glucose monitoring interventions to usual 
care. However, the uncertainty around the ICERs was large. The net budget impact 
of publicly funding continuous glucose monitoring assuming a 20% annual increase 
in adoption of continuous glucose monitoring would range from $8.5 million in 
year 1 to $16.2 million in year 5.Patient engagement surrounding the topic of 
continuous glucose monitoring was robust. Patients perceived that these devices 
provided important social, emotional, and medical and safety benefits in 
managing type 1 diabetes, especially in children.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous glucose monitoring was more effective than 
self-monitoring of blood glucose in managing type 1 diabetes for some outcomes, 
such as time spent in the target glucose range and time spent outside the target 
glucose range (moderate certainty in this evidence). We were less certain that 
continuous glucose monitoring would reduce the number of severe hypoglycemic 
events. Compared with self-monitoring of blood glucose, the costs of continuous 
glucose monitoring were higher, with only small increases in health benefits. 
Publicly funding continuous glucose monitoring for the type 1 diabetes 
population in Ontario would result in additional costs to the health system over 
the next 5 years. Adult patients and parents of children with type 1 diabetes 
reported very positive experiences with continuous glucose monitoring. The high 
ongoing cost of continuous glucose monitoring devices was seen as the greatest 
barrier to their widespread use.

Bone and muscle are two deeply interconnected organs and a strong relationship 
between them exists in their development and maintenance. The peak of both bone 
and muscle mass is achieved in early adulthood, followed by a progressive 
decline after the age of 40. The increase in life expectancy in developed 
countries resulted in an increase of degenerative diseases affecting the 
musculoskeletal system. Osteoporosis and sarcopenia represent a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in the elderly population and are associated with a 
significant increase in healthcare costs. Several imaging techniques are 
currently available for the non-invasive investigation of bone and muscle mass 
and quality. Conventional radiology, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound often 
play a complementary role in the study of osteoporosis and sarcopenia, depicting 
different aspects of the same pathology. This paper presents the different 
imaging modalities currently used for the investigation of bone and muscle mass 
and quality in osteoporosis and sarcopenia with special emphasis on the clinical 
applications and limitations of each technique and with the intent to provide 
interesting insights into recent advances in the field of conventional imaging, 
novel high-resolution techniques and fracture risk.

Six histologically confirmed cases of esthesioneuroblastoma re reported. Two 
case had presented with primarily an intracranial mass, two had intracranial 
extension of a nasal tumour and the remaining two had only nasal growth. Local 
recurrence in the form of a swelling at the root of nose and metastases to the 
cervical vertebra, dorsal extradural space and lumbar subarachnoid space were 
seen in one case each. Aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation therapy and 
chemotherapy improved the qualityof life in locally recurrent and metastatic 
disease. CT scan findings and the role of chemotherapy in the primary metastatic 
esthesioneuroblastoma are discussed.

Universitari de Bellvitge, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Iron overload cardiomyopathy (IOC) is an important predictor 
of prognosis in a significant number of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis 
and hematologic diseases. Its prevalence is increasing because of improved 
treatment strategies, which significantly improve life expectancy. We will 
review diagnosis, treatment, and recent findings in the field.
RECENT FINDINGS: The development of preclinical translational disease models 
during the last years have helped our understanding of specific disease 
pathophysiological pathways that might eventually change the outcomes of these 
patients.
SUMMARY: IOC is an overlooked disease because of the progressive silent disease 
pattern and the lack of physicians' expertise. It mainly affects patients with 
hemochromatosis and hematologic diseases and its prevalence is expected to 
increase with the improvement in life expectancy of hematologic disorders. Early 
diagnosis of IOC in patients at risk by means of biochemical parameters and 
cardiac imaging can lead to early treatment and improved prognosis. The mainstay 
of treatment of IOC is conventional heart failure treatment, combined with 
phlebotomies or iron chelation in the context of anemia. The development of 
preclinical models has provided a comprehensive look into specific 
pathophysiological pathways with potential treatment strategies that must be 
sustained by future randomized trials.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the elbasvir/grazoprevir 
(EBR/GZR) regimen in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.
DESIGN: This study uses a health economic model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of treating previously untreated and treatment experienced 
chronic hepatitis C patients who have severe and end stage renal disease with 
the elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus no treatment in the French context. The 
lifetime homogeneous markovian model comprises of forty combined health states 
including hepatitis C virus and chronic kidney disease. The model parameters 
were from a multicentre randomized controlled trial, ANRS CO22 HEPATHER French 
cohort and literature. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations of patient health states for 
each treatment strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% 
confidence intervals calculations. The results were expressed in cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
PATIENTS: The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years 
and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no 
fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage 
(portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without 
fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV 
genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage 4, 33% had a severe 
renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal impairment stage 5 
treated by dialysis.
INTERVENTION: Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir 
and grazoprevir compared to no-treatment.
RESULTS: EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no 
treatment (5.1 years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was 
higher for the new treatment because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 
versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was of €15,212 per 
QALY gained for the base case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that 
simultaneously looks at the disease evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic 
kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon and ribavirin, produced the greatest 
benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in 
treatment-naïve or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and 
stage 4-5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients. Based on shape of 
the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a 
willingness to pay of €20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with 
severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.

The increasing burden of interpersonal violence in women in Mexico is a 
neglected social and health problem that competes with other leading causes of 
premature death, disability, and health losses in young women. In this article, 
we focus on revealing the burden of violence in girls and young women and its 
implications for public policy. This study presents the subnational analysis of 
Mexico from the Global Burden of Disease study (1990-2015). The global study 
harmonized information of 195 countries and 79 risk factors. The study analyzed 
the deaths, years of life lost to premature death (YLL), years lived with 
disability (YLD), and the healthy years of life lost or disability-adjusted life 
year (DALY) related to violence. Nationwide, violence in young women accounts 
for 7% of all deaths in the 10 to 29 years age group and arises as the second 
most important cause of death in all age groups, except 10 to 14 years old, 
where it stands in the seventh position from 1990 to 2015. The health losses and 
social impact related to violence in young women demands firm actions by the 
government and society. It is urgent for health institutions to focus on the 
health of girls and young women because gender inequities have an enormous 
effect on their lives. Girls and women are nearly universally less powerful, 
less privileged, and have fewer opportunities than men.

BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation services provide support to smokers who desire to 
quit. Published studies to date have looked at the cost and benefit of service 
provision but typically focus on clinical trial data. Using routinely collected 
observational data, this study examined the costs involved in providing a 
service in terms of average health care expenditure per successful quit attempt 
in addition to population - level cost-effectiveness measures.
METHODS: Data were analysed from Quit-51 smoking cessation service across five 
English regions between March 2013 and March 2016 (n = 9116). For each user, 
costs were estimated in relation to: (i) time spent with advisers; (ii) 
prescription of pharmacotherapy. The total costs compared against self-reported 
quit at 12 weeks, which represents the time period for which the service is 
offered. Cost per quit (CPQ), with 95% confidence interval (CI), was calculated 
by relating total expenditure to the number of quitters, firstly for the whole 
dataset and then by subgroups of key categorical variables, namely; gender, age 
group, the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD). Confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean estimates were 
derived using a non-parametric bootstrap procedure. Parameters derived from the 
calculation in relation to treatment were used to estimate potential long-term 
population outcomes under a scenario where the Quit 51 prescription was rolled 
out nationally.
RESULTS: The overall mean CPQ for this sample as estimated at 12 weeks was 
£403.51 (95% CI = £393.36 to £413.76). The estimated CPQs at this time point 
were comparable for those aged 12-19 (£423.56, 95% CI = £369.45 to £492.60) and 
those aged 20-29 (£430.76, 95% CI = £395.95 to £470.56). Differences were also 
seen in relation to other subgroups considered. The treatment parameters 
translated to a projected increase of 1.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
per 1000 smokers in the short-term and 23.4 QALYS per 1000 smokers based on a 
lifetime horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: These figures throw light on service expenditure for each 
successful quit over the timeframe for which the service is offered in addition 
to highlighting variability in these costs across different subgroups of the 
user population.

countries: evidence from Palestine.

Bank, Palestine.

BACKGROUND: Research conducted on conditions responsible for the greatest 
disease burden should be given the highest priority, particularly in 
resource-limited settings. The present study aimed to assess the research output 
in relation to disease burden in Palestine and to identify the conditions which 
are under- or over-investigated, if any.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and Scopus for reports of original research relevant 
to human health or healthcare authored by researchers affiliated with 
Palestinian institutions and published between January 2000 and December 2015. 
We categorised the condition studied in included articles using the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) taxonomy. Data regarding burden of disease (percentage 
of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) was obtained from the 
Palestine profile in the GBD study. We examined the degree of discordance 
between the observed number of published articles for each disease/condition 
with the expected number based on the proportion of disease burden of that 
disease/condition.
RESULTS: Our search identified 2469 potentially relevant records, from which 
1650 were excluded following the screening of titles and abstracts. Of the 
remaining 819 full-text articles, we included 511 in our review. Communicable 
(infectious) diseases (n = 103; 20%) was the condition with the highest number 
of published studies. However, cancer (n = 15; 3%) and chronic respiratory 
diseases (n = 15; 3%) were the conditions with the lowest number of published 
studies. Research output was poorly associated with disease burden, irrespective 
of whether it was measured in terms of DALYs (rho = -0.116, P = 0.7) or death 
(rho = 0.217, P = 0.5). Cardiovascular disease, cancer, and maternal and 
neonatal deaths accounted for more than two-thirds of the total deaths in 
Palestine (67%), but were infrequently addressed (23%) in published articles.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of research waste measured by a mismatch between 
the health burden of certain diseases/conditions and the number of published 
research reports on those diseases/conditions in Palestine. A national research 
priority-setting agenda should be developed to meet the local community's need 
for quality evidence to implement independent and informed health policies.

BACKGROUND: Expression IV survey evaluated the patients' expectations to a 
maintenance therapy.
METHODS: From January 2015 to March 2016, 401 French patients, in first line or 
recurrent disease, answered a 24-items anonymous questionnaire. The results were 
specifically analyzed according to the demographic characteristics and treatment 
lines.
RESULTS: Among the patients, 62% had already been informed about maintenance 
therapy. Thirty-seven percent of patients received a maintenance treatment: 111 
patients during first line and 39 patients in relapse. Expectations of patients 
were: 1) the chance of cure (73%), 2) the tumor shrinkage (36%), 3) quality of 
life improvement (35%) and 4) tumor growth reduction (27%). Among the 
responders, 42% were willing to take the treatment for 6-24 months, 20% for 
24-60 months and 38% until tumor progression. 64% of patients expected more than 
a 6 months progression-free survival. Patients older than 70 years were less 
informed than their younger counterparts (48% vs 66%) and had lesser hope for 
cure with maintenance treatment (60% vs 77%). Patients in relapse had more 
expectation than patients in remission (tumor shrinkage: 47% vs 22%, slowing of 
tumor growth: 37% vs 15%, improving the progression-free survival of more than 6 
months: 71% vs 53%, respectively). Among patients, 48% in relapse consented to 
take a treatment until progression vs 24% of patients in remission.
CONCLUSION: This sub-analysis in French patients demonstrate a gap between the 
efficacy of maintenance therapy and the patients' expectations in ovarian 
cancer, particularly in relapsing disease justifying better information and 
explanations.

OBJECTIVE: The impact of weight loss intervention on disability-free life 
expectancy in adults with diabetes is unknown. We examined the impact of a 
long-term weight loss intervention on years spent with and without physical 
disability.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes age 
45-76 years (n = 5,145) were randomly assigned to a 10-year intensive lifestyle 
intervention (ILI) or diabetes support and education (DSE). Physical function 
was assessed annually for 12 years using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. 
Annual incidence of physical disability, mortality, and disability remission 
were incorporated into a Markov model to quantify years of life spent active and 
physically disabled.
RESULTS: Physical disability incidence was lower in the ILI group (6.0% per 
year) than in the DSE group (6.8% per year) (incidence rate ratio 0.88 [95% CI 
0.81-0.96]), whereas rates of disability remission and mortality did not differ 
between groups. ILI participants had a significant delay in moderate or severe 
disability onset and an increase in number of nondisabled years (P < 0.05) 
compared with DSE participants. For a 60-year-old, this effect translates to 0.9 
more disability-free years (12.0 years [95% CI 11.5-12.4] vs. 11.1 years [95% CI 
10.6-11.7]) but no difference in total years of life. In stratified analyses, 
ILI increased disability-free years of life in women and participants without 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) but not in men or participants with CVD.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term lifestyle interventions among overweight or obese adults 
with type 2 diabetes may reduce long-term disability, leading to an effect on 
disability-free life expectancy but not on total life expectancy.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that 
currently has no cure. At present, the only approved treatment for ALS is 
Riluzole, a glutamate release blocker that improves life expectancy by 3-6 
months. ALS-Endotherapia (GEMALS) is a novel therapeutic approach to treat ALS 
and the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential beneficial 
effects of this novel treatment. A total of 31 patients with ALS were assessed 
in the current study. Deceleration of the disease was observed in 83.87% 
(P<0.0001) of patients and mean life expectancy was increased by 38 months. 
Motor functions, including breathing, walking, salivation, speech, swallowing 
and writing, were also improved in patients treated with GEMALS. The results of 
the present study demonstrate that long-term treatment with GEMALS has a 
curative effect in patients with ALS. Furthermore, the overall effectiveness of 
GEMALS was assessed using the ALS Assessment Questionnaire. The score 
improvement was 76.2 and 100% for men and women, respectively (P<0.0001), 
compared with the worldwide reference score. The present study provides a 
promising basis for the use of GEMALS as a therapeutic treatment for patients 
with ALS; however, these results must be confirmed in a double-blinded and 
randomized clinical trial.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 5% of primary breast cancer patients present de novo 
stage IV breast cancer, for whom systematic therapy is the mainstream treatment. 
The role of surgical excision of the primary tumor has been controversial due to 
inconsistent results of relevant studies. Recently, with the reports of some 
relevant preclinical data, retrospective studies and randomized clinical trials, 
we've got more evidence to reexamine the issue. Based on those above, a 
literature review and meta-analysis was performed to determine whether surgery 
of the primary tumor could improve overall survival in the setting of stage IV 
breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, OVID, American Society 
of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) symposium documents, European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO) symposium documents and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium 
(SABCS) symposium documents was performed to identify published literature that 
evaluated survival benefits from excision of the primary tumor in the setting of 
stage IV breast cancer. Data were extracted in review of appropriate studies by 
the authors independently. The primary endpoint was overall survival following 
surgical removal of the primary tumor. Secondary endpoints were the impacts of 
surgery on progression free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP).
RESULTS: Data from 19 retrospective studies showed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.65 
(95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.60-0.71, P < 0.01= for overall survival 
(OS), indicating a 35% reduction in risk of mortality in patients who underwent 
surgical excision of the primary tumor. Nevertheless, the analysis of 3 
randomized clinical trials revealed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.85 (95% CI, 
0.59-1.21, P = 0.359) for OS in the surgical group. According to the 
meta-regression, the survival benefit was independent of age, tumor size, site 
of the metastases, and PR or HER-2 status, acceptance of systematic therapies 
and radiotherapy and inversely correlated with the ER+ status of the population 
included.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first meta-analysis that includes both retrospective 
and prospective studies regarding the impact of surgery of the primary tumor on 
survival in stage IV breast cancer patients. According to the analytical 
results, we do not recommend surgery of the primary tumor as routine therapy for 
stage IV breast cancer. However, for those who are supposed to have long life 
expectancy, physicians could discuss it with these patients, put forward surgery 
as a therapy choice and perform the operation under deliberation.

CONTEXT: Although the association between low free triiodothyronine (FT3) and 
poor outcome has been extensively reported in literature, the degree of 
peripheral thyroxin deiodination and its relationship with frailty and survival 
in hospitalized older patients has not yet been fully established. The aim of 
the current study was to evaluate the possible correlation between FT3/free 
thyroxine (FT4) ratio reduction, an indirect marker of thyroxin deiodination 
impairment, and frailty status and survival in hospitalized older patients.
METHODS: We consecutively enrolled older patients, hospitalized in the 
geriatrics ward of the University of Pisa. At admission, Multidimensional 
Geriatric Assessment (MGA) and Multi Prognostic Index (MPI), an indirect measure 
of frailty, were obtained from all the patients. Causes of hospitalization and 
prevalence of delirium were recorded. Blood samples for FT3, FT4, and 
thyrotropin value evaluation were drawn after an overnight fast.
RESULTS: A total of 643 patients (83.8 ± 7.4 years, 53% women) were studied. FT3 
was inversely and strongly correlated, whereas FT4 was moderately positively 
correlated with MGA parameters, MPI score (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, 
respectively), and survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.09, respectively). FT3/FT4 
ratio reduction was highly associated with worse MGA (P < 0.001) and MPI scores 
(P < 0.0001), even in patients without low FT3. The inclusion of FT3 in the 
final model of multivariate Cox regression confirmed the independent role of 
FT3/FT4 ratio in predicting survival (P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Overall, our study documented a strong association between FT3/FT4 
ratio reduction, a surrogate marker of peripheral thyroxin deiodination, and 
frailty. Moreover, FT3/FT4 ratio value emerged as independent marker of 
survival, even in patients with normal FT3 values.

BACKGROUND: physical activity promotes healthy aging. However, little is known 
about the relationship between physical activity levels and healthy and chronic 
disease-free life expectancy (LE). The study aim was to examine healthy and 
chronic disease-free LE between ages 50 and 75 and across various levels of 
physical activity by sex and different occupational statuses.
METHODS: overall, 34,379 women (mean age 53.2 (SD 2.9) years) and 8,381 men 
(53.6 (SD 3.2) years) from the Finnish Public Sector study were categorized into 
five physical activity levels (inactive to vigorously active) according to 
self-reported physical activity and into three occupational statuses at the 
first observation point. Partial LE between ages 50 and 75 based on 
discrete-time multistate life table models was defined using two health 
indicators: healthy LE based on self-rated health and chronic disease-free LE
