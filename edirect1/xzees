patients will be compared with another 76 receiving usual care in a 
non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. The following main outcomes will be 
measured every 3 months: emotional distress, spirituality, demoralization, 
quality of life, and medication adherence. Secondary outcomes will include 
symptomatology, health education, cost-utility analyses, usability and 
satisfaction with the platform, and time to detect emotional needs and provide 
care. Baseline differences between groups will be measured with the Student 
t-test or chi-square test, as appropriate. We will then compare the main 
outcomes between groups over time using multilevel linear models, report effect 
sizes (Hedges' g), and assess non-inferiority. The cost-utility of both 
interventions will be considered in terms of quality adjusted life years and 
quality of life given the costs of providing each treatment.
DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial should provide new evidence on the 
efficacy and cost-utility of an eHealth ecosystem to deliver personalized and 
timely psychosocial care to patients with advanced lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Tracheostomy-related tracheal tear is a serious complication that 
may follow surgical or percutaneous tracheostomy. Pediatric populations carry a 
higher risk because of anatomical differences. The aim of this article is to 
review this condition and to help in its diagnosis and management with the 
assistance of clinical and radiological findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An English literature review was done using the terms 
pediatric, tracheostomy, tracheal tear and tracheostomy tube.
RESULT: Two cases reported in the literature met the criteria to be included in 
the review.
DISCUSSION: Tracheostomy-related tracheal tear needs immediate diagnosis as it 
may lead to life-threatening outcomes, such as pneumothorax, respiratory 
distress, extensive subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Symptoms and 
complications of the tear may occur intraoperatively or postoperatively. Gold 
standard methods for diagnosis include flexible or rigid tracheobronchoscopy, 
which helps in determining the management plan. The treatment choices for 
iatrogenic tracheal tears depend on the tear site, size, and extension of the 
tear and patient's hemodynamic status. Conservative management is sufficient for 
stable patients with small tears, whereas surgical management is essential for 
unstable patients and those with large or complicated tears.
CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy-related tracheal tear is a serious rare complication. 
The pediatric age group carries a higher risk of the condition and its 
management, either conservative or surgical, depends on airway endoscopy 
findings and patient's hemodynamic status.

AIMS: Hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin delivery systems improve glycemia and 
quality of life among youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D), however there are 
inequities in use. We aimed to evaluate whether differences in positive 
expectancy of HCL systems may explain differences in use.
METHODS: Fifteen publicly-insured, non-Hispanic Black (NHB) youth with 
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥ 10% enrolled in a study exploring changes in glycemia 
and person reported outcomes (PRO) during 6 months of Tandem t:slim X2 insulin 
pump with Control-IQ technology. At baseline youth and parents completed PROs, 
including Insulin Delivery Systems: Perceptions, Ideas, Reflections and 
Expectations (INSPIRE) survey assessing positive expectancy of HCL use, and 
Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) survey assessing diabetes-related distress. 
Differences between this cohort and the Tandem Control-IQ pediatric pivotal 
trial (DCLP5) cohort were assessed.
RESULTS: As compared to the DCLP5 cohort (0% NHB, 10% publicly-insured), 
baseline glycemic indicators were suboptimal (MHbA1c 11.9 ± 1.4% vs 7.6 ± 0.9%, 
p < 0.0001; continuous glucose monitor (CGM) time-above-range > 180 mg/dL 
82 ± 15% vs 45 ± 18%, p < 0.0001). INSPIRE scores in both cohorts were equally 
high among youth (80 ± 10 vs 77 ± 13, p = 0.41) and parents (88 ± 14 vs 85 ± 11, 
p = 0.37). PAID scores were higher among parents (68 ± 19 vs 43 ± 16, 
p < 0.0001), but not youth (43 ± 16 vs 35 ± 16, p = 0.09) in the historically 
marginalized cohort as compared to the DCLP5 cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in glycemic control and diabetes related 
burden, positive expectancy of HCL systems is comparable among historically 
marginalized youth with T1D and the predominantly non-Hispanic White, privately 
insured DCLP5 cohort. These findings suggest that differences in perceptions of 
HCL technology may not explain inequities in use.

Life-Course Transitions in Rural Residence and Old-Age Mortality in Iowa, 
1930-2014.

Early-life conditions are associated with mortality in men, but not studied to 
the same extent in women. We add new evidence by studying a cohort of women born 
between 1916 and 1931 and followed for mortality between 1986 and 2013. Our 
sample from Iowa includes a significant number of rural women, from both farms 
and small towns. The long-term effects of growing up in a rural area were mixed: 
farmers' daughters lived longer than women growing up off-farm in rural areas. 
Daughters of farm laborers and skilled or semi-skilled trades workers fared 
worst, when considering early-life socioeconomic status. We also find evidence 
that migrating to small-town Iowa was associated with lower life expectancy 
after age fifty-five. Considering social class and farm-nonfarm status is 
important for understanding the health of rural America.

BACKGROUND: Real-world data on long-term outcomes of vedolizumab (VDZ) are 
scarce.
OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term outcomes (up to 3 years) of VDZ in treating 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
DESIGN: A nationwide, prospective multicentre extension of a Swedish 
observational study on VDZ assessing Effectiveness And Healthcare resource 
utilization in patients with IBD (SVEAH).
METHODS: After re-consent, data of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 68) 
and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 46) treated with VDZ were prospectively 
recorded using an electronic case report form integrated with the Swedish IBD 
Register (SWIBREG). The primary outcome was clinical remission (defined as 
Harvey-Bradshaw Index ⩽4 in CD and partial Mayo score ⩽2 in UC) at 104 and 
156 weeks in patients with a response and/or remission 12 weeks after starting 
VDZ. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and 
biochemical outcomes.
RESULTS: VDZ continuation rates were high at weeks 104 and 156, 88% and 84%, 
respectively, for CD and 87% and 78%, respectively, for UC. Of the 53 CD 
patients with a response/remission at 12 weeks, 40 (75%) patients were in 
remission at 104 weeks and 42 (79%) patients at 156 weeks. For UC, these numbers 
were 25/31 (81%) and 22/31 (71%), respectively. Improvements were seen in the 
Short Health Scale (p < 0.01 for each dimension; CD, n = 51; UC, n = 33) and the 
EuroQol 5-Dimensions, 5-levels index value (p < 0.01; CD, n = 39; UC, n = 30). 
Median plasma-C-reactive protein concentrations (mg/L) decreased from 5 at 
baseline to 4 in CD (p = 0.01, n = 53) and from 5 to 4 in UC (p = 0.03, n = 34) 
at 156 weeks. Correspondingly, median faecal-calprotectin (µg/g) decreased from 
641 to 114 in CD patients (p < 0.01, n = 26) and from 387 to 37 in UC patients 
(p = 0.02, n = 17).
CONCLUSION: VDZ demonstrated high continuation rates and was associated with 
improvements in clinical outcomes, HRQoL measures and inflammatory markers at 2 
and 3 years after treatment initiation in this prospective national SVEAH 
extension study.

Neoplasms of the salivary glands are relatively uncommon, with varied histologic 
subtypes. Only 5% of these occur in the pediatric age group. The submandibular 
gland tumors account for just 11.5% of pediatric salivary gland tumors. Few 
studies have reported the occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma arising in 
submandibular gland in a child. We describe a case of pleomorphic adenoma 
affecting submandibular gland in a girl aged eleven years and provide a brief 
review of current literature. Thorough diagnostic evaluation is required, 
considering the diverse differential diagnoses of pediatric submandibular 
masses. Although benign, recurrence and malignant transformation are pertinent 
concerns in pleomorphic adenoma, especially in a child, considering long life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Whether cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics impact longevity with 
and without cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has not been well established. This 
study aimed to investigate the association between CVH metrics and life 
expectancy in participants free of CVD events. We hypothesized that ideal CVH 
status was associated with increased life expectancy and assessed the effect of 
CVH status as a prevention target of longevity in the framework of predictive, 
preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM).
METHODS: A total of 92,795 participants in the Kailuan study were examined and 
thereafter followed up until 2020. We considered three transitions (from non-CVD 
events to incident CVD events, from non-CVD events to mortality, and from CVD 
events to mortality). The multistate lifetable method was applied to estimate 
the life expectancy.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 13 years, 12,541 (13.51%) deaths occurred. 
Compared with poor CVH, ideal CVH attenuated the risk of incident CVD events and 
mortality without CVD events by approximately 58% and 27%, respectively. Women 
with ideal CVH at age 35 had a 5.00 (3.23-6.77) year longer life expectancy free 
of CVD events than did women with poor CVH metrics. Among men, ideal CVH was 
associated with a 6.74 (5.55-7.93) year longer life expectancy free of CVD 
events.
CONCLUSION: An ideal CVH status is associated with a lower risk of premature 
mortality and a longer life expectancy, either in the general population or in 
CVD patients, which are cost-effective ways for personalized medicine of 
potential CVD patients. Our findings suggest that the promotion of a higher CVH 
score or ideal CVH status would result in reduced burdens of CVD events and 
extended disease-free life expectancy, which offered an accurate prediction for 
primary care following the concept of PPPM/3PM.

Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) result in life-threatening 
energy metabolism deficiencies/energy source depletion. Triheptanoin is an 
odd-carbon, medium chain triglyceride (that is an anaplerotic substrate of 
calories and fatty acids) for treating pediatric and adult patients with 
LC-FAODs. Study CL202 (NCT02214160), an open-label extension study of study 
CL201 (NCT01886378), evaluated the long-term safety/efficacy of triheptanoin in 
patients with LC-FAODs (N = 94), including cohorts who were triheptanoin naïve 
(n = 33) or had received triheptanoin in study CL201 (n = 24) or in 
investigator-sponsored trials/expanded access programs (IST/EAPs; n = 37). 
Primary endpoint was the annualized rate of LC-FAOD major clinical events (MCEs; 
rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy). Mean ± standard deviation (SD) 
triheptanoin treatment durations were 27.4 ± 19.9, 46.9 ± 13.6, and 
49.6 ± 21.4 months for the triheptanoin-naïve, CL201 rollover, and IST/EAP 
cohorts, respectively. In the triheptanoin-naïve cohort, median (interquartile 
range [IQR]) MCE rate significantly decreased from 2.00 (0.67-3.33) 
events/patient/year pre-triheptanoin to 0.28 (0.00-1.43) events/patient/year 
with triheptanoin (p = 0.0343), a reduction of 86%. In the CL201 rollover 
cohort, mean ± SD MCE rate significantly decreased from 1.76 ± 1.64 
events/patient/year pre-triheptanoin to 1.00 ± 1.00 events/patient/year with 
triheptanoin (p = 0.0347), a reduction of 43%. In the IST/EAP cohort, mean ± SD 
MCE rate was 1.40 ± 2.37 (median [IQR] 0.57 [0.00-1.67]) events/patient/year 
with triheptanoin. Safety data were consistent with previous observations. 
Treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 68.1% of 
patients and were mostly mild/moderate in severity. Five patients had seven 
serious treatment-related TEAEs; all resolved. Our results confirm the long-term 
efficacy of triheptanoin for patients with LC-FAOD.

Lifestyle is central to a person's disease risk and overall health. Numerous 
health conditions are caused or exacerbated by unhealthy behaviors such as 
smoking, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor dietary 
habits. Estimates suggest that unhealthy behaviors were directly responsible for 
more than 23 million deaths and 36.5% of disability-adjusted life-years in 2017 
alone. Day-to-day behaviors have profound implications for both short- and 
long-term health outcomes and quality of life. Positive or health-enhancing 
behaviors promote well-being, reduce disease risk, and improve quality of life. 
Health-enhancing behaviors include avoiding harmful substances (e.g., alcohol 
and tobacco), maintaining adequate physical activity levels, good nutrition, 
sufficient sleep, and stress management. On the other hand, negative or 
health-compromising behaviors refer to those which increase the risk of 
developing disease, reduce well-being, and worsen the quality of life. 
Health-compromising behaviors include physical inactivity, substance abuse, and 
chronic excess calorie intake. While the importance of maintaining healthy 
behaviors has been extensively documented in the medical literature, habits and 
behaviors remain unchanged at the population level. Studies have shown a 
decrease in the number of adults adhering to healthy behaviors in the United 
States. Between 1988 and 2006, the percentage of US adults adhering to 5 key 
health behaviors (not smoking, avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, eating 
five or more fruits/vegetables per day, exercising more than 12 times per month, 
and maintaining a healthy body weight) decreased from 15% to 8%. Furthermore, it 
is estimated that adhering to a healthy lifestyle could prolong life expectancy 
by 14.0 years for female adults and 12.2 years for male adults in the US. Over 
the last decades, organizations, public health agencies, and healthcare 
professionals have started to highlight the importance of maintaining healthy 
habits. There have been many awareness and health promotion campaigns at the 
population level. However, the efficacy of these campaigns on behavioral 
outcomes remains controversial. It is estimated that mass media health 
communication campaigns in the United States promoting behavior change have an 
average positive effect size of 5%. Understanding the factors influencing 
behavior is crucial to developing effective interventions and improving 
adherence to a healthy lifestyle. Human behavior is a complex phenomenon that 
involves changes or actions related to external circumstances. When discussing 
health behaviors, multiple factors have the potential to facilitate 
health-compromising behaviors or interfere with health-enhancing behaviors. The 
Intention-Behavior Gap  A person's intention is the motivation to perform a 
behavior or attain a goal. In other words, an intention is an instruction that a 
person gives themselves to perform or omit a specific action, such as "I will 
exercise for 30 minutes" or "I will stop smoking." Even though the behavior is 
considered to be voluntary, it is not always aligned with a person's intentions. 
Health-compromising behaviors are hard to stop, and health-promoting behaviors 
are challenging to adopt, so intention alone is not necessarily a predictor of 
behavior change. The intention-behavior gap refers to the discrepancy between 
what a person intends to do and what the person does. The odds of a person being 
able to act according to their intentions can be influenced by internal (eg, 
beliefs, skills, knowledge) and external factors (e.g., time, money, social 
support). Understanding the intention-behavior gap can help healthcare 
professionals understand the difficulties that patients encounter when seeking 
behavior modification and allow for implementing strategies that address such 
problems and improve adherence to a healthier lifestyle. Interventions targeting 
health behaviors should be tailored to the patient's place on the 
intention-behavior spectrum, promoting intention formation when patients don't 
feel ready to change or don't recognize the need for modifying behavior 
(increasing motivation), facilitating initiation when intentions have been 
formed (making a plan), reinforcing behavior when action has been taken (staying 
on course), and providing support when lapses occur (getting back on track).

Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) binds a variety of structurally dissimilar ligands in 
the adult central nervous system to inhibit axon extension. Disruption of ligand 
binding to NgR1 and subsequent signaling can improve neuron outgrowth, making 
NgR1 an important therapeutic target for diverse neurological conditions such as 
spinal crush injuries and Alzheimer's disease. Human NgR1 serves as a receptor 
for mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), but the mechanism of virus-receptor 
engagement is unknown. To elucidate how NgR1 mediates cell binding and entry of 
reovirus, we defined the affinity of interaction between virus and receptor, 
determined the structure of the virus-receptor complex, and identified residues 
in the receptor required for virus binding and infection. These studies revealed 
that central NgR1 surfaces form a bridge between two copies of viral capsid 
protein σ3, establishing that σ3 serves as a receptor ligand for reovirus. This 
unusual binding interface produces high-avidity interactions between virus and 
receptor to prime early entry steps. These studies refine models of reovirus 
cell-attachment and highlight the evolution of viruses to engage multiple 
receptors using distinct capsid components.

diversity and inherited disease risk in the Doberman dog breed.

BACKGROUND: Publicly available phenotype data and genotyping array data from two 
citizen science projects: "Doberman Health Surveys" and "The Doberman Diversity 
Project" were analyzed to explore relative homozygosity, diversity, and disorder 
risk according to geographical locale and breeding purpose in the Doberman.
RESULTS: From the phenotypic data cohort, life expectancy of a Doberman at birth 
is 9.1 years. The leading causes of death were heart disease (accounting for 28% 
of deaths) and cancers (collectively accounting for 14% of deaths). By 
genotyping, the world Doberman population exists as four major cohorts (European 
exhibition-bred, Americas exhibition-bred, European work, Americas 
pet/informal). Considering the entire Doberman population, four genomic regions 
longer than 500 Kb are fixed in 90% or more of 3,226 dogs included in this 
study. The four fixed regions reside on two autosomal chromosomes: 
CFA3:0.8-2.3 Mb (1.55 Mb); CFA3: 57.9-59.8 Mb (1.8 Mb); CFA31:0-1.2 Mb (1.2 Mb); 
and CFA31:4.80-6.47 Mb (1.67 Mb). Using public variant call files including 
variants for eight Doberman pinschers, we observed 30 potentially functional 
alternate variants that were evolutionarily diverged relative to the wider 
sequenced dog population within the four strongly homozygous chromosomal 
regions. Effective population size (Ne) is a statistical measure of breed 
diversity at the time of sampling that approximates the number of unique 
individuals. The major identified sub-populations of Dobermans demonstrated Ne 
in the range 70-236. The mean level of inbreeding in the Doberman breed is 40% 
as calculated by the number of array variants in runs of homozygosity divided by 
the assayed genome size (excluding the X chromosome). The lowest observed level 
of inbreeding in the Dobermans assayed was 15% in animals that were first 
generation mixes of European and USA bred Dobermans. Array variant analysis 
shows that inter-crossing between European and USA-bred Dobermans has capacity 
to re-introduce variation at many loci that are strongly homozygous.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that efforts to improve breed diversity first should 
focus on regions with the highest fixation levels, but managers must ensure that 
mutation loads are not worsened by increasing the frequencies of rarer 
haplotypes in the identified regions. The analysis of global data identified 
regions of strong fixation that might impact known disorder risks in the breed. 
Plausible gene candidates for future analysis of the genetic basis of cardiac 
disease and cancer were identified in the analysis.

BACKGROUND: Norway is a high-income nation with universal tax-financed health 
care and among the highest per person health spending in the world. This study 
estimates Norwegian health expenditures by health condition, age, and sex, and 
compares it with disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
METHODS: Government budgets, reimbursement databases, patient registries, and 
prescription databases were combined to estimate spending for 144 health 
conditions, 38 age and sex groups, and eight types of care (GPs; 
physiotherapists & chiropractors; specialized outpatient; day patient; 
inpatient; prescription drugs; home-based care; and nursing homes) totaling 
174,157,766 encounters. Diagnoses were in accordance with the Global Burden of 
Disease study (GBD). The spending estimates were adjusted, by redistributing 
excess spending associated with each comorbidity. Disease-specific DALYs were 
gathered from GBD 2019.
RESULTS: The top five aggregate causes of Norwegian health spending in 2019 were 
mental and substance use disorders (20.7%), neurological disorders (15.4%), 
cardiovascular diseases (10.1%), diabetes, kidney, and urinary diseases (9.0%), 
and neoplasms (7.2%). Spending increased sharply with age. Among 144 health 
conditions, dementias had the highest health spending, with 10.2% of total 
spending, and 78% of this spending was incurred at nursing homes. The second 
largest was falls estimated at 4.6% of total spending. Spending in those aged 
15-49 was dominated by mental and substance use disorders, with 46.0% of total 
spending. Accounting for longevity, spending per female was greater than 
spending per male, particularly for musculoskeletal disorders, dementias, and 
falls. Spending correlated well with DALYs (Correlation r = 0.77, 95% CI 
0.67-0.87), and the correlation of spending with non-fatal disease burden 
(r = 0.83, 0.76-0.90) was more pronounced than with mortality (r = 0.58, 
0.43-0.72).
CONCLUSIONS: Health spending was high for long-term disabilities in older age 
groups. Research and development into more effective interventions for the 
disabling high-cost diseases is urgently needed.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to investigate and map empirical 
evidence of patient involvement interventions to support patients with kidney 
failure making end-of-life care decisions in kidney services.
INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidance integrating end-of-life care within kidney 
failure management pathways varies. Advance care planning interventions aimed at 
involving patients with kidney failure in their end-of-life care planning are 
established in some countries. However, there is limited evidence of the other 
types of patient involvement interventions integrated within services to support 
patients with kidney failure in making decisions about their end-of-life care.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review included studies exploring patient 
involvement interventions evaluated for patients with kidney failure considering 
end-of-life care, their relatives, and/or health professionals in kidney 
services. Studies of children under the age of 18 years were excluded.
METHODS: The review was informed by JBI methodology and the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review 
guidelines. MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and CINAHL were searched for full-text 
studies in English, Danish, German, Norwegian, or Swedish. Two independent 
reviewers assessed the literature against the inclusion criteria. A relational 
analysis framework was used to synthesize the data extracted from the included 
studies, and to investigate and map different patient involvement interventions.
RESULTS: The search identified 1628 articles, of which 33 articles met the 
inclusion criteria. A total of 23 interventions were described. Interventions 
targeted patients (n=3); health professionals (n=8); patients and health 
professionals (n=5); and patients, relatives, and health professionals (n=7). 
Intervention components included patient resources (eg, information, patient 
decision aids), consultation resources (eg, advance care planning, shared 
decision-making), and practitioner resources (eg, communication training). 
Patient involvement interventions were delivered within hospital-based kidney 
services.
CONCLUSIONS: The review identified several ways to support patients with kidney 
failure to be involved in end-of-life care decisions. Future interventions may 
benefit from adopting a complex intervention framework to engage multiple 
stakeholders in the research and design of an intervention for shared 
decision-making between patients with kidney failure, their relatives, and 
health professionals about integrating end-of-life care options into their 
kidney disease management pathway.

Cystic Fibrosis: A Review.

Ong T(1), Ramsey BW(1).

University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle.

    JAMA. 2023 Oct 10;330(14):1388.

IMPORTANCE: Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder defined by variants in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, affects more 
than 30 000 individuals in the US and approximately 89 000 worldwide. Absent or 
decreased function of the CFTR protein is associated with multiorgan dysfunction 
and shortened life expectancy.
OBSERVATIONS: CFTR is an anion channel in the apical membrane of epithelial 
cells. Loss of function leads to obstructed exocrine glands. Of people with 
cystic fibrosis in the US, approximately 85.5% have the gene variant F508del. 
Manifestations of cystic fibrosis in patients with the F508del gene variant 
begin in infancy with steatorrhea, poor weight gain, and respiratory symptoms 
(coughing, wheezing). As people with cystic fibrosis age, chronic respiratory 
bacterial infections cause loss of lung function and bronchiectasis. With the 
availability of universal newborn screening in multiple countries including the 
US, many people with cystic fibrosis are asymptomatic at diagnosis. With 
multidisciplinary care teams that included dietitians, respiratory therapists, 
and social workers, treatment of cystic fibrosis can slow disease progression. 
Median survival has improved from 36.3 years (95% CI, 35.1-37.9) in 2006 to 53.1 
years (95% CI, 51.6-54.7) in 2021. Pulmonary therapies for patients with cystic 
fibrosis consist of mucolytics (eg, dornase alfa), anti-inflammatories (eg, 
azithromycin), and antibiotics (such as tobramycin delivered by a nebulizer). 
Four small molecular therapies, termed CFTR modulators, that facilitate CFTR 
production and/or function have received regulatory approval. Examples are 
ivacaftor and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. For example, in patients with 1 
F508del variant, the combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor 
improved lung function from -0.2% in the placebo group to 13.6% (difference, 
13.8%; 95% CI, 12.1%-15.4%) and decreased the annualized estimated rate of 
pulmonary exacerbations from 0.98 to 0.37 (rate ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.55). 
Improved respiratory function and symptoms have lasted up to 144 weeks in 
postapproval observational studies. An additional 177 variants are eligible for 
treatment with the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination.
CONCLUSION: Cystic fibrosis affects approximately 89 000 people worldwide and is 
associated with a spectrum of disease related to exocrine dysfunction, including 
chronic respiratory bacterial infections and reduced life expectancy. First-line 
pulmonary therapies consist of mucolytics, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics, 
and approximately 90% of people with cystic fibrosis who are 2 years or older 
may benefit from a combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor.

BACKGROUND: Emotional symptoms, such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, are 
common during adolescence, often persist over time, and can precede the 
emergence of severe anxiety and depressive disorders. Studies suggest that a 
vicious cycle of reciprocal influences between emotional symptoms and 
interpersonal difficulties may explain why some adolescents suffer from 
persisting emotional symptoms. However, the role of different types of 
interpersonal difficulties, such as social isolation and peer victimisation, in 
these reciprocal associations is still unclear. In addition, the lack of 
longitudinal twin studies conducted on emotional symptoms during adolescence 
means that the genetic and environmental contributions to these relationships 
during adolescence remain unknown.
METHODS: Participants (N = 15,869) from the Twins Early Development Study 
completed self-reports of emotional symptoms, social isolation and peer 
victimisation at 12, 16 and 21 years old. A phenotypic cross-lagged model 
examined reciprocal associations between variables over time, and a genetic 
extension of this model examined the aetiology of the relationships between 
variables at each timepoint.
RESULTS: First, emotional symptoms were reciprocally and independently 
associated with both social isolation and peer victimisation over time, 
indicating that different forms of interpersonal difficulties uniquely 
contributed to emotional symptoms during adolescence and vice versa. Second, 
early peer victimisation predicted later emotional symptoms via social isolation 
in mid-adolescence, indicating that social isolation may constitute an 
intermediate pathway through which peer victimisation predicts longer-term 
emotional symptoms. Finally, individual differences in emotional symptoms were 
mostly accounted for by non-shared environmental factors at each timepoint, and 
both gene-environment and individual-specific environmental mechanisms were 
involved in the relationships between emotional symptoms and interpersonal 
difficulties.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the necessity to intervene early in 
adolescence to prevent the escalation of emotional symptoms over time and to 
consider social isolation and peer victimisation as important risk factors for 
the long-term persistence of emotional symptoms.

Small graft pieces (size: 0.15 × 0.2 mm to 0.1 × 0.4 mm and 0.25 × 0.25 mm) were 
isolated from the prospective prosencephalic ectoderm of the definitive 
primitive streak (st. 4) and head process (st. 5) chick blastoderms, and 
cultured in vivo intracoelomically. In all 1437 graft pieces isolated from 448 
donor blastoderms were transplanted into the coelom of 941 host embryos; 216 
hosts died before reaching 12 days. The 725 surviving hosts, which carried 1241 
implants, yielded 304 analysable grafts. The very small size of the isolates 
affected the recovery rate. The histological analysis of the recovered grafts 
reveals that the frequency of neuralization was higher in the grafts isolated 
from the central region of the prospective prosencephalic ectoderm than in those 
from its peripheral region. A centrifugal extension of differentiation 
tendencies of prosencephalic structures was observed from st. 4 to st. 5. At st. 
5 frequency of telencephalic structures was high in the grafts of the anterior 
region, whereas that of diencephalic structures was high in those of the more 
posterior region. Eye structures (retina as well as tapetum) differentiated in 
an area measuring ca. 0.4 × 0.1 mm extending transversely about 0.1 mm anterior 
to the head process at st. 5. Structural elements of the lens were not observed 
in any graft.

INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use leads to near-normal life 
expectancy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); unfortunately for 
some patients, adverse drug effects (ADEs) and medication burden associated with 
TKI therapy can lead to decreased quality of life. Additionally, TKIs have drug 
interactions that may negatively impact patients' management of co-morbidities 
or lead to increased ADEs.
CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old female with a history of anxiety treated and 
controlled with venlafaxine experienced increased and resistant anxiety and 
insomnia after starting dasatinib for CML.
MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: On dasatinib, the patient experienced worsening anxiety 
and insomnia. The stress of a new leukemia diagnosis, drug interactions, and 
ADEs from dasatinib were considered possible causes. Dose adjustments to 
dasatinib and venlafaxine were made to control the patient's symptoms. However, 
the patient's symptoms did not resolve. After being on dasatinib for 2.5 years, 
the patient discontinued TKI therapy due to being in a deep molecular remission 
and given ongoing challenges managing anxiety. Within 4 months of stopping 
dasatinib, the patient reported an improvement in anxiety and overall emotional 
wellbeing. She continues to feel better and remains in a complete molecular 
remission 20 months off treatment.
DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates a possible previously unknown drug 
interaction with dasatinib as well as a possible rarely reported ADE of 
dasatinib. Additionally, it highlights the difficulties patients with 
psychiatric disorders may face on TKI therapy and challenges providers may have 
in identifying rare psychiatric ADEs, thus emphasizing the need for 
documentation of these types of cases.

8 The donor of tomorrow: challenges posed by the pandemic, demographic change, 
and increased transplant requirements.

In the Corona pandemic, the importance of donor health for the supply of 
patients with high-quality transplants has once again become particularly 
apparent in the field of cornea donation.And there are further challenges ahead: 
Due to new operation methods such as lamellar techniques an earlier stage of 
disease can be treated hence patients are being operated at younger ages. At the 
same time, with demographic change, potential donors are getting 
older.Therefore, the demand for a high-quality transplant without pre-operations 
seems to be difficult to fulfil in the future. This is particularly important in 
the highly developed industrialised countries, where the indications for corneal 
transplantation are different and the expected quality characteristics are 
therefore other than in emerging or developing countries, for example. At the 
same time, the new surgical methods present the tissue banks with new tasks to 
meet the surgeons' demands.In the DGFG network, the average age of corneal 
donors is currently 69.7 years while the requests for transplants with a high 
endothelial cell density (ECD) increase. The ECD continues to be one of the main 
criteria for a high-quality cornea and is more likely to be found in younger 
donors. As mentioned at the beginning, however, the average life expectancy in 
Germany is already currently around 80 years.It seems that it is impossible to 
find the perfect donor of tomorrow. With the increase in the need for 
high-quality transplants, the question must be asked whether donor shortage is a 
home-grown problem in industrialised countries. What developments need to be 
initiated to counter the trend towards donor shortage? Could greater flexibility 
at the medical and/or regulatory level be a solution? The presentation aims to 
shed light on these and other questions and would like to discuss this with the
