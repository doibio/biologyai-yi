Background: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency 
is characterized by recurrent attacks of edema of the skin and mucosal tissues. 
Symptoms usually present during childhood (mean age at first attack, 10 years). 
Earlier symptom onset may predict a more severe disease course. Subcutaneous 
(SC) C1INH is indicated for routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in 
adolescents and adults. We analyzed the long-term efficacy of C1INH (SC) in 
subjects ≤17 years old treated in an open-label extension (OLE) of the pivotal 
phase III Clinical Study for Optimal Management of Preventing Angioedema with 
Low-Volume Subcutaneous C1 Inhibitor Replacement Therapy (COMPACT) trial. 
Methods: Eligible subjects (age ≥6 years, with ≥4 attacks over 2 consecutive 
months before entry into the OLE or placebo-controlled COMPACT trial) were 
treated with C1INH (SC) 40 or 60 IU/kg twice weekly for 52-140 weeks. Subgroup 
analyses by age (≤17 vs. >17 years) were performed for key efficacy endpoints. 
Results: Ten subjects were ≤17 years old [mean (range) age, 13.3 (8-16) years, 3 
subjects <12 years old; exposure range, 51-133 weeks]. All 10 pediatric subjects 
experienced ≥50% reduction (mean, 93%) in number of attacks versus the prestudy 
period, with a 97% reduction in the median number of attacks/month (0.11). All 
subjects had <1 attack/4-week period and 4 had <1 attack/year (1 subject was 
attack free). No subject discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related 
adverse event. Conclusions: Data from pediatric subjects treated with C1INH (SC) 
for up to 2.55 years and adult subjects revealed similar efficacy. C1INH (SC) is 
effective and well tolerated as long-term prophylaxis in children, adolescents, 
and adults with HAE.

BACKGROUND: Biological invasion is one of the main threats to tropical 
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Prosopis juliflora (Sw) DC. (Fabales: 
Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) was introduced in the Caatinga dry forest of 
Northeast Brazil at early 1940s and successfully spread across the region. As 
other invasive species, it may benefit from the soils and seed dispersal by 
livestock. Here we examine how seed dispersal ecology and soil conditions 
collectively affect seed germination, early seedling performance and 
consequently the P. juliflora invasive potential.
METHODS: Seed germination, early seedling survival, life expectancy and soil 
attributes were examined in 10 plots located across three habitats (flooding 
plain, alluvial terrace and plateau) into a human-modified landscape of the 
Caatinga dry forest (a total of 12,000 seeds). Seeds were exposed to four seed 
dispersal methods: deposition on the soil surface, burial in the soil, passed 
through cattle (Boss taurus) digestive tracts and mixed with cattle manure and 
passed through mule (Equus africanus asinus × Equus ferus caballus) digestive 
tracts and mixed with mule manure. Seeds and seedlings were monitored through a 
year and their performance examined with expectancy tables.
RESULTS: Soils differed among habitats, particularly its nutrient availability, 
texture and water with finely-textured and more fertile soils in the flooding 
plain. Total seed germination was relatively low (14.5%), with the highest score 
among seeds buried in the flooding plain (47.4 ± 25.3%). Seed dispersal by 
cattle and mule also positively impacted seed germination. Early seedling 
survival rate of P. juliflora was dramatically reduced with few seedlings still 
alive elapsed a year. Survival rate was highest in the first 30 days and 
declined between 30 and 60 days with stabilization at 70 days after germination 
in all seed treatments and habitats. However, survival and life expectancy were 
higher in the flooding plain at 75 days and lower in the plateau. Prosopis 
juliflora seedling survival and life expectancy were higher in the case seeds 
were mixed with cattle manure.
SYNTHESIS: Prosopis juliflora seeds and seedlings are sensitive to water stress 
and habitat desiccation. Therefore, they benefit from the humid soils often 
present across human-disturbed flooding plains. This plant also benefits from 
seed deposition/dispersal by livestock in these landscapes, since cattle manure 
represents a nutrient-rich and humid substrate for both seeds and seedlings. The 
quality of the seed dispersal service varies among livestock species, but this 
key mutualism between exotic species is due to the arillate, hard-coated and 
palatable seeds. Prosopis juliflora traits allow this species to take multiple 
benefits from human presence and thus operating as a human commensal.

Trisomy 16 is the most common type of autosomal trisomy associated with 
spontaneous abortion and is incompatible with life. Upon examining previously 
reported cases of partial chromosome 16q duplication, it was noted that the 
majority of cases had complex chromosomal abnormalities due to parental balanced 
chromosomal translocation carriage. The clinical presentation of very rare pure 
partial trisomy 16q cases was associated with congenital anomalies, facial 
dysmorphic findings and intellectual disability. In this study, we evaluated the 
physical characteristics and genetic data of an 8-month-old girl with 
developmental delay and facial dysmorphic features. Dysmorphic features 
including prominent metopic suture, synophrys, asymmetric head shape, triangular 
and asymmetric face, telecanthus, epicanthal folds, down-slanting palpebral 
fissures, microphthalmia of the left eye, anteverted nares, smooth and tented 
philtrum, microretrognathia, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, auricular pits, 
high-arched palate, thin upper lip and hypotonia were recorded. Her karyotype 
was 46,XX,add(16)(q24). To identify the extension of the duplicated section, 
array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis was performed, which 
showed a de novo 29.8 Mb duplication [arr[hgl9] 16q12.1q23.3(52459169-82285105) 
x 3], interpreted to be pathogenic. We present this case report to clarify the 
clinical findings of a rare chromosomal anomaly, discuss the genes that may be 
related to the phenotype and advance the literature in terms of knowledge 
regarding genotypephenotype correlation.

Despite effective therapies that have extended the life expectancy of persons 
living with HIV, 35-70% of these adults still develop some form of cognitive 
impairment, and with a growing population of aging adults with HIV, the 
prevalence of these cognitive deficits is likely to increase. The mechanisms 
underlying these HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders remain poorly 
understood but are often accelerated by the aging process and accompanied by 
disturbances in sensory processing, which may contribute to the observed 
cognitive decline. The goal of the current study was to identify the impact of 
aging on HIV-related alterations in inhibitory processing and determine whether 
such alterations are related to cognitive impairment in neuroHIV. We used 
magnetoencephalographic imaging, advanced time series analysis methods, and a 
paired-pulse stimulation paradigm to interrogate inhibitory processing in 87 
HIV-infected aging adults and 92 demographically matched uninfected controls 
(22-72 years old). Whole-brain maps linking age and neural indices were computed 
for each group and compared via Fisher's Z transformations. Peak voxel 
time-series data were also extracted from the resulting images to quantify the 
dynamics of spontaneous neural activity preceding stimulation onset in each 
group. Whole-brain analyses using the somatosensory gating index, a metric of 
inhibitory processing and age distinguished impaired adults with HIV from 
unimpaired HIV-infected adults and controls. Briefly, younger cognitively 
impaired adults with HIV strongly utilized the prefrontal cortices to gate 
somatosensory input, and the role of this region in gating was uniquely and 
significantly modulated by aging only in impaired adults with HIV. Spontaneous 
neural activity preceding stimulus onset was also significantly elevated in the 
prefrontal cortices of those with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and 
this elevation was significantly related to the CD4 nadir across both 
HIV-infected groups. This is the first study to examine the impact of aging on 
inhibitory processing in HIV-infected adults with and without cognitive 
impairment. Our findings suggest that young adults with HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder utilize the prefrontal cortices to gate (i.e. suppress) 
redundant somatosensory input, and that this capacity uniquely diminishes with 
advancing age in impaired adults with HIV.

PURPOSE: Blood pressure telemonitoring and remote counselling (BPTM) improves 
blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension (HTN). Studies 
assessing the efficacy of BPTM from a value-based perspective are lacking. We 
investigated whether BPTM fits all principles of the value-based approach 
(clinical and economic effectiveness, improvement in patient-reported 
outcome/experience measures (PROM/PREM)).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty ambulatory patients with 
uncontrolled HTN were randomised in a 2: 1 manner to BPTM (n = 160, mean age 
47 y.o.) and usual care (UC, n = 80; 49 y.o.) with baseline and 3-month 
follow-up clinic visits. BPTM employed a mobile application (for patients) and a 
desktop version (for clinician), which allowed communication and exchange of 
medical data. The main outcomes were changes in office and ambulatory systolic 
(S) BPs, rate of BP control. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 
incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) were evaluated in economic analysis. The 
MOS SF-36 score was taken as a PROM, and the PEQ score was used as a PREM.
RESULTS: Larger decreases in office and ambulatory SBPs (-16.8 and -8.9 mm Hg, 
respectively; p < .05) was achieved in BPTM group while the treatment intensity 
was equal (2.4 drugs). The ICER 11.1 EUR/-1 mm Hg 24-hour SBP/1 year was 75% 
effective as per willingness-to-pay threshold. BPTM improved PROM (+2.1 in mean 
MOS SF-36; p = .04), reduced long-term mortality (+0.11 life years gained), 
leading to +0.49 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as compared with UC. 
The ICUR was 4 169.4 EUR/QALY gained. Patient-reported experience was higher in 
the BPTM (+10 PEQ, p = .01). The UC group showed minor changes in MOS SF-36 and 
PEQ (+1.3; +6, respectively; p n.s.).
CONCLUSIONS: Being cost-effective, BPTM incorporates both clinical benefits and 
patient-perceived value. Larger randomised studies are needed to confirm our 
findings.

BACKGROUND: Current health economic analysis guidelines emphasize the importance 
of using nationally appropriate cost and valuation inputs. However, some 
countries lack national data, and some analyses focus on interventions with 
costs and benefits at regional or global scales.
METHODS: Recognizing the need for better estimates of appropriate values for 
application at these levels than those used in the past, we characterize 
population-weighted dollar per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted by 
World Bank Income Level based on available national estimates of the marginal 
productivity of the healthcare system.
RESULTS: The defaults suggested here reflect health opportunity costs across 
countries more consistent with existing evidence than those previously used or 
recommended. As countries change income levels and healthcare spending, and as 
additional or updated marginal productivity of healthcare expenditure estimates 
become available, we expect the defaults to change.
CONCLUSION: The best option for informing decisions around resource allocation 
in health care such that they improve health outcomes overall remains the use of 
time-appropriate country-specific estimates of the marginal productivity of the 
healthcare system. Instead of single, time-invariant defaults, health economists 
should seek to develop valuation inputs that better account for health 
opportunity costs and do so over time.

BACKGROUND: Hypoglycemia in cystic fibrosis (CF), in the absence of 
glucose-lowering therapies, has long been identified as an important issue in 
the management of CF. There is currently still no unifying hypothesis for its 
etiology.
AIM: The aims of this study were to perform a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT) in participants with CF and (1) document glucose, insulin, glucagon, 
glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide 
(GIP) release patterns within varying glucose tolerance groups during the OGTT; 
(2) determine the prevalence of hypoglycemic during the OGTT; and (3) define any 
association between hypoglycemia and patterns of insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, and 
GIP release.
METHODS: Eligible participants attending an adult CF clinic completed a 3-h 
OGTT. Hypoglycemia on OGTT was defined as mild (glucose 3.4-3.9 mmol/L), 
moderate (glucose 3.1-3.3 mmol/L), and severe (glucose ≤ 3 mmol/L). Hormones 
were measured at fasting, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min.
RESULTS: Twenty-four participants completed the study, of which 7 had normal 
glucose tolerance, 12 had abnormal glucose tolerance, and 5 had cystic fibrosis 
related diabetes (CFRD). All participants had a delayed insulin response 
compared with normative data. All glucose tolerance groups showed appropriate 
and similar suppression of fasting glucagon. Four participants (17%) had mild 
hypoglycemic, three (13%) had moderate hypoglycemic, and eight (33%) had severe 
hypoglycemic. No participant with CFRD demonstrated hypoglycemic. Of the 19 
participants without CFRD, 15 (79%) experienced hypoglycemic. Participants with 
hypoglycemic had greater peak glucose and insulin responses than those that did 
not have hypoglycemic, and this approached significance (p = .0625 for glucose 
and p = .0862 for insulin). No significant mean differences between GLP-1 and 
GIP release were found. There was no relationship between hypoglycemic and 
modulator therapy.
CONCLUSION: Postprandial hypoglycemic was unmasked by the extension of an OGTT 
to 3 h. Delayed and abnormal insulin release, and ineffective counter-regulatory 
action of glucagon may have a role in its etiology.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the commonest form of cancer among women globally, 
including in India. The rising incidence in the developing world is thought to 
be due to increased life expectancy, urbanisation, and adoption of western 
lifestyles. A recent systematic review found that Indian women living in India 
or as immigrants in Canada experienced a range of psychological distresses both 
ameliorated and exacerbated by cultural issues personally, within the family, 
within their community, and in the context of faith, and only two of the five 
qualitative studies explored the experience of women with breast cancer living 
in India. Distress may also affect treatment compliance.
AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the psychological distresses 
experienced by Indian women with breast cancer living in Kerala, South India, 
during and after treatment and to understand better what helped to relieve or 
increase these distresses.
METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 consenting women undergoing 
treatment for breast cancer. Purposive sampling was used to obtain maximum 
variation in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Interviews were 
verbatim transcribed, translated into English, and back-translated to Malayalam 
to ensure that the meaning had not been lost. English data were analysed using 
thematic frame work analysis and synthesised to provide a deeper understanding 
of the individuals' experience.
RESULTS: Three major themes emerged from the data. The first major theme was 
'far-reaching psychological distress'. This included anxiety, guilt, anger, and 
depression in response to the disease and physical side effects of treatment and 
issues relating to body image, especially hair loss and sexuality. The second 
major theme was 'getting on with life'. Women tried to make sense of the 
disease, by actively seeking information, the role of medical professionals, and 
their practical adaptations. Many found a new future and a new way to live 
normal. The third major theme was the 'support system' strongly based on family, 
friends, faith, and the community which affect them positively as well as 
negatively.
CONCLUSION: Psychological concerns related to disease and treatment are common 
in Indian women with particular emphasis on body image issues associated with 
hair loss. Family and faith were key support systems for almost all the women, 
although it could also be the causes of distress.

University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Oral health research in children has focused both on identifying the 
risk factors for dental caries and on the impact the disease has on children's 
life.
AIM: Identifying studies that used the salutogenic theory to investigate 
positive aspects to promote a healthy condition in preschool children.
DESIGN: A literature scoping review was conducted to answer the question: 'What 
has been produced in scientific literature about children's oral health with a 
salutogenic theoretical reference?' The checklist preferred reporting items for 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
was applied. The research was conducted on the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web 
of Science with no language, design, country or date restrictions. Three 
independent reviewers selected the studies to be included in the research, 
extracted data, and assessed the studies' contribution to the review.
RESULTS: Among the 38 studies retained, 10 were included, those were published 
between 2009 and 2018: five in Brazil, two in the United States of America, and 
one in Canada, China and India, respectively. All articles were published in 
English language. Nine studies investigated the relation between the 
parents'/caretakers' sense of coherence and aspects related to the children's 
oral health condition. One study investigated health factors among the parents 
of caries-free children.
CONCLUSION: Salutogenic orientation must be included in oral health research, so 
that salutary and risk factors may coexist, contributing to a new perspective 
for oral health promotion among children.

Bartolomei, S, Nigro, F, D'Amico, A, Cortesi, M, and Di Michele, R. Mud pack 
with menthol and Arnica montana accelerates recovery following a high-volume 
resistance training session for lower body in trained men. J Strength Cond Res 
36(7): 1909-1915, 2022-The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a mud 
pack, containing menthol and Arnica montana, on the recovery responses following 
a high-volume resistance protocol. Ten resistance-trained men (mean ± SD: age = 
25.3 ± 6.1 years; body mass = 79.1 ± 10.6 kg; height = 178.9 ± 7.5 cm) performed 
a high-volume resistance workout for lower body squat and leg extension, (5 sets 
of 10 reps at 70% of one repetition maximum for both exercises). All the subject 
used mud (MUD) or a placebo (PL) in randomized counterbalanced crossover design. 
MUD or PL were applied 4 times: 3, 19, 27, and 45 hours after the workout, on 
the skin surface above the quadriceps muscle of both legs. Muscle performance 
(countermovement jump power [CMJP], isokinetic leg press at 75 cm·s-1 and 25 
cm·s-1 [ISOK75 and ISOK25, respectively], isometric squat [ISQ]), and morphology 
(muscle thickness of vastus lateralis [VLMT]), were measured before exercise 
(baseline [BL]), and 15 minutes (15P), 24 hours (24P), and 48 hours (48P) 
postexercise. In addition, muscle soreness was assessed at the same time points 
using a visual analog scale (VAS). No significant interactions (p > 0.05) 
between the trials were detected for CMJP, ISOK75, ISQ, and VLMT. A significant 
interaction between trials was noted for ISOK25 (p = 0.022) and for VAS (p = 
0.001). ISOK25 was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced from BL at 15P, 24P and 48P 
in PL, whereas changes were significant (p < 0.05) at 15P and 24P only in MUD. 
The present findings indicate that MUD may enhance the recovery rate of strength 
and reduce muscle soreness after high-volume exercise. Muscle morphology do not 
seem to be influenced by mud packs.

HIV infection is considered a major risk factor for primary central nervous 
system lymphoma (PCNSL). However, the percentage of PCNSL that occurs in 
HIV + patients is not well defined. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HIV 
infection in patients with PCNSL through a systematic review and meta-analysis. 
Electronic databases were searched for studies assessing the presence of HIV 
infection in series of patients with PCNSL. Pooled prevalence of HIV infection 
in PCNSL was calculated, with a subgroup analysis based on the geographic area. 
Twenty-seven studies with 6422 patients were included. Overall, pooled 
prevalence of HIV infection among PCNSL patients was 6.1 % with high 
heterogeneity. In the subgroup analysis, pooled prevalence was 3.6 % in India 
with low heterogeneity, 30.2 % (overall) and 16.5 % (after 2000) in the USA with 
high heterogeneity, 5.7 % in Europe with high heterogeneity, 2.2 % in East Asia 
with null heterogeneity, 7.3 % in South America with moderate heterogeneity. In 
conclusion, only a minor part of PCNSL occurs in patients with HIV. The results 
stratified by geographic area reflect the different prevalence of HIV infection 
in the general population, except for India, probably due to the shorter life 
expectancy of HIV + patients.

BACKGROUND: Management of malignant diseases in elderly patients has become a 
global clinical issue because of increased life expectancy worldwide. 
Advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative management have reduced 
age-related contraindications for LPD. Past articles have reported that elderly 
patients undergoing laproscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) are at an increased 
risk compared to younger patients. The aim of this article is to compare a 
multicenter center risk of LPD in elderly and nonelderly patients.
METHODS: Retrospective review (n = 237) of perisurgical outcomes in patients 
undergoing LPD during the months of September 2012 to December 2017. Outcomes in 
elderly patients (aged ≥75 years) were compared with those in nonelderly 
patients.
RESULTS: Transfer to ICU was more frequent in elderly patients (odds ratio [OR] 
6.49, P = .001) and the mean hospital stay was longer (21.4 days compared with 
16.6 days), (P = .0033) than for nonelderly patients. There was no statistically 
significant difference in operation time (P = .494), estimated blood loss 
(P = .0519), blood transfusion (P = .863), decreased gastric emptying 
(P = .397), abdominal pain (P = .454), food intake (P = .241), time to 
self-ambulation (P = 1), reoperation (P = .543), postoperative pancreatic 
fistula (POPF) grade A (P = .454), POPF grade B (P = .736), POPF grade C 
(P = .164), hemorrhage (P = .319), bile leakage (P = .428), infection 
(P = .259), GI bleeding (P = .286), morbidity (P = .272) or mortality (P = .449) 
between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients who underwent LPD in this study had good overall 
outcomes after LPD that were similar to young patients. The perioperative and 
long-term outcomes of LPD are not worse. Rates of ICU admission and hospital 
stays increased in elderly patients undergoing LPD when compared with nonelderly 
ones. LPD can be performed on elderly patients with similar outcomes as younger 
patients; therefore, age itself should not be a contraindication for LPD for 
pancreatic cancer, but it suggests that elderly patients with comorbidities 
should be more stringently selected for surgery.

Japanese older adults: The Yamanashi Healthy-Active Life Expectancy cohort study 
based on the STROBE guidelines.

With the advance of medical care, the duration of dependency on nursing care in 
later life has increased worldwide. There is a question of whether farm work 
could extend or shorten the dependency duration. We investigated the association 
between farm work experience and the duration of dependency on nursing support 
or care in late life.We randomly selected 600 adults aged ≥65 years, who were 
independent and not hospitalized, as part of the Yamanashi Healthy-Active Life 
Expectancy cohort and followed them for 13 years. We defined the duration of 
dependency as the time from reception of long-term care insurance benefits to 
death, and we adjusted for multiple covariates.We analyzed data from 225 adults 
(139 men and 86 women) who died during the follow-up period. Ninety four had 
received long-term care benefits. Mean age was 79.6 years (standard deviation 
[SD]: 6.3) in individuals with farm work experience and 80.1 years (SD: 7.2) in 
individuals without farm work experience. The estimated duration of dependency 
on long-term care was 1.3 years (standard error [SE]: 0.4) in individuals with 
farm work experience vs 2.1 years (SE: 0.5) in individuals without farm work 
experience (P = .01). The estimated duration of dependency in individuals with 
farm work experience and without farm work experience was 0.4 years (SE: 0.5) vs 
1.3 years (SE: 0.6) in men respectively (P = .03) and 1.6 years (SE: 0.9) vs 2.4 
years (SE: 0.9) in women, respectively (P = .16). The sensitivity analysis 
yielded an estimated duration of 1.2 years (SE: 0.5) in those with farm work 
experience and 2.3 years (SE: 0.5) in those without farm work experience 
(P = .004).Individuals with farm work experience required less long-term care 
prior to death, suggesting that agricultural and physical activities promote 
health. Policymakers focusing on preventing the need for nursing care in older 
populations could consider promoting farming or gardening.

Mucolipidosis II and III (ML II/III) are caused by a deficiency of 
uridine-diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine: 
lysosomal-enzyme-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase 
(GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.8.17), which tags lysosomal enzymes with a 
mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) marker for transport to the lysosome. The process is 
performed by a sequential two-step process: first, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase 
catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc-1-phosphate to the selected mannose residues on 
lysosomal enzymes in the cis-Golgi network. The second step removes GlcNAc from 
lysosomal enzymes by N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester 
α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (uncovering enzyme) and exposes the mannose 
6-phosphate (M6P) residues in the trans-Golgi network, in which the enzymes are 
targeted to the lysosomes by M6Preceptors. A deficiency of 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase causes the hypersecretion of lysosomal enzymes out 
of cells, resulting in a shortage of multiple lysosomal enzymes within 
lysosomes. Due to a lack of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, the accumulation of 
cholesterol, phospholipids, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and other undegraded 
substrates occurs in the lysosomes. Clinically, ML II and ML III exhibit quite 
similar manifestations to mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), including specific 
skeletal deformities known as dysostosis multiplex and gingival hyperplasia. The 
life expectancy is less than 10 years in the severe type, and there is no 
definitive treatment for this disease. In this review, we have described the 
updated diagnosis and therapy on ML II/III.

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal brain cancer. Current treatments 
involve surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the life 
expectancy of patients with this disease remains short and chemotherapy leads to 
severe adverse effects. Furthermore, the presence of the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) makes it difficult for drugs to effectively reach the brain. A promising 
strategy lies in the use of graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which are 
light-responsive graphene nanoparticles that have shown the capability of 
crossing the BBB. Here we investigate the effect of GQDs on U87 human 
glioblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons. Non-functionalized GQDs 
(NF-GQDs) demonstrated high biocompatibility, while 
dimethylformamide-functionalized GQDs (DMF-GQDs) showed a toxic effect on both 
cell lines. The combination of GQDs and the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin 
(Dox) was tested. GQDs exerted a synergistic increase in the efficacy of 
chemotherapy treatment, specifically on U87 cells. The mechanism underlying this 
synergy was investigated, and it was found that GQDs can alter membrane 
permeability in a manner dependent on the surface chemistry, facilitating the 
uptake of Dox inside U87 cells, but not on cortical neurons. Therefore, 
experimental evidence indicates that GQDs could be used in a combined therapy 
against brain cancer, strongly increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy and, at 
the same time, reducing its dose requirement along with its side effects, 
thereby improving the life quality of patients.

BACKGROUND: The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in the aging 
population, challenging the sustainability of traditional care models that have 
relied on in-person monitoring. This debate article discusses whether artificial 
intelligence health monitoring may be suitable enhancement or replacement for 
elder care.
MAIN TEXT: Internationally, as life expectancy continues to rise, many countries 
are facing a severe shortage of direct care workers. The health workforce is 
aging, and replacement remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence health 
monitoring technologies may play a novel and significant role in filling the 
human resource gaps in caring for older adults by complementing current care 
provision, reducing the burden on family caregivers, and improving the quality 
of care. Nonetheless, opportunities brought on by these emerging technologies 
raise ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure that these automated 
systems can truly enhance care and health outcomes for older adults. This debate 
article explores some ethical dimensions of using automated health monitoring 
technologies. It argues that, in order for these health monitoring technologies 
to fulfill the wishes of older adults to age in place and also to empower them 
and improve their quality of life, we need deep knowledge of how stakeholders 
may balance their considerations of relational care, safety, and privacy.
CONCLUSION: It is only when we design artificial intelligence health monitoring 
technologies with intersecting clinical and ethical factors in mind that the 
resulting systems will enhance productive relational care, facilitate 
independent living, promote older adults' health outcomes, and minimize waste.

BACKGROUND: With the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), patients with 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have a life expectancy similar to those of age- 
and gender-matched healthy populations. Nevertheless, patients receiving TKIs 
report chronic adverse events such as fatigue, edema, and muscle cramps, which 
lead to a decrease in their quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to assess the QoL and symptom burden in patients receiving original 
imatinib, generic imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 121 patients with CML who received TKIs for at 
least 3 months were enrolled in the study. The QoL was assessed with the 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chronic 
Myeloid Leukemia (QLQ-CML24) modules. The symptom burden was assessed with MD 
Anderson Symptom Inventory for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) and EORTC 
QLQ-CML24.
RESULTS: The median age of the study population was 53 years (range, 28-90 
years), and 83 (81.4%) patients had a low-to-medium Sokal risk score. The 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of most patients were good 
(< 2; 96%), and comorbidity scores were low (HCT-CI < 3; 90.8%). There was no 
significant difference between the general health status of patients in terms of 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CML24. According to the results of the MDASI-CML and 
QLQ-CML24 modules, the most common symptom was fatigue (58.7%) in all groups, 
and there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the 
effects on the daily life activities of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CML receiving first- and second-generation TKIs were 
seen to have a similar QoL and symptom burden.

INTRODUCTION: Discussing the evolution of life-threatening diseases and 
end-of-life issues remains difficult for patients, relatives and professionals. 
Helping people discuss and formalise their preferences in end-of-life care, as 
planned in the Go Wish intervention, could reduce health-related anxiety in the 
advance care planning (ACP) and advance directive (AD) process. The aims of this 
study are (1) to test the effectiveness of the Go Wish intervention among 
outpatients in early-stage palliative care and (2) to understand the role of 
defence mechanisms in end-of-life discussions among nurses, patients and 
relatives.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-methods study will be performed. A cluster 
randomised controlled trials with three parallel arms will be conducted with 45 
patients with chronic progressive diseases impacting life expectancy in each 
group: (1) Group A, Go Wish intervention for patients and their relatives; (2) 
Group A, Go Wish intervention for patients alone and (3) Group B, for patients 
(with a waiting list), who will receive the standardised information on ADs 
(usual care). Randomisation will be at the nurse level as each patient is 
referred to one of the 20 participating nurses (convenience sample of 20 
nurses). A qualitative study will be conducted to understand the cognitive and 
emotional processes and experiences of nurses, patients and relatives confronted 
with end-of-life discussions. The outcome measurements include the completion of 
ADs (yes/no), anxiety, quality of communication about end-of-life care, 
empowerment, quality of life and attitudes towards ADs.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Human 
Research Ethics Committee of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland (no. 2019-00922). 
The findings will be disseminated to practice (nurses, patients and relatives), 
to national and international scientific conferences, and peer-reviewed journals 
covering nursing science, psychology and medicine.

Performance-based financing (PBF) is a mechanism to improve the quality and the 
utilisation of health benefit packages. There is a dearth of economic 
evaluations of PBF in the 'real world'. Afghanistan implemented PBF between 2010 
and 2015 and evaluated the programme using a pragmatic cluster-randomised 
control trial. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of the PBF programme 
in Afghanistan, compared with the standard of care, from the provider payer's 
perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PBF compared with the 
standard of care was US$1242 per disability-adjusted life year averted; not 
cost-effective when compared with an opportunity cost threshold of US$349. 
Incentive payments were the main contributor to PBF financial cost (70%) 
followed by data verification (23%), staff time (5%) and administration (2%). 
The unit cost per case of antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance (SBA) 
and postnatal care (PNC) services in the standard of care was US$0.96 (95% CI 
0.92-1.0), US$4.8 (95% CI 4.1-6.3) and US$1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.4), respectively, 
whereas the cost of ANC, SBA and PNC services per case in PBF areas were US$4.72 
(95% CI 4.68-5.7), US$48.5 (95% CI 48.0-52.5) and US$5.4 (95% CI 5.1-5.9), 
respectively. To conclude, our study found that PBF, as implemented in the 
Afghan context, was not the best use of funds to strengthen the delivery of 
maternal and child health services. The cost-effectiveness of alternative PBF 
designs needs to be appraised before using PBF at scale to support health 
benefit packages. PBF needs to be considered in the context of funding the range 
of constraints that inhibit health service performance improvement.
