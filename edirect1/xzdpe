perceiving urban development and transition, and for providing critical 
information for future growth. Transformation and shift identification are the 
tools used to recognise distinctions in a land cover by tracking them at various 
times. In addition, various change identification and detection approaches are 
routinely tested with the goal of providing the greatest change detection 
deductions for a particular appliance. This review would aim to establish a 
practical plan that combines remote sensing techniques, on the one hand, and 
modelling approaches, on the other, to track land use, to cover changes, and to 
predict future trends.

Erythrocyte alloimmunization is a major barrier to transfusion in sickle cell 
disease (SCD) because it can lead to transfusion deadlock and the development of 
life-threatening hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs). Several risk factors 
have been identified, such as blood group polymorphism in these patients of 
African ancestry frequently exposed to antigens they do not carry and an 
inflammatory clinical state of the disease. The most important preventive 
measure is prophylactic red blood cell antigen matching, and there is a 
consensus that matching for Rh (D, C, E, c, e) and K antigens should be 
performed for all SCD patients. However, some patients are high responders and 
more at risk of developing antibodies and HTRs. For these patients, the 
extension of matching to other blood groups, including variant antigens of the 
RH blood group, the use of genotyping rather than serology to characterize 
significant blood groups, and the prophylactic administration of 
immunosuppressive treatments remain a matter of debate due to low levels of 
certainty concerning their effects and the difficulty of determining which 
patients, other than those already immunized, are at high risk. These issues 
were recently addressed by a panel of experts established by the American 
Society of Hematology. Here, we review and stratify the various interventions 
for preventing alloimmunization, based on the literature and our experience and 
taking into account the obstacles to their implementation and any future 
developments required.

Older adults with multiple myeloma (MM) are a growing population, and 
personalizing treatment based on disease and health status is imperative. 
Similar to MM staging systems that provide disease-related prognostic 
information, myeloma-specific frailty tools can better identify subgroups at 
greatest risk for treatment-related toxicity and early treatment 
discontinuation, as well as predict overall survival. Several myeloma-specific 
validated tools are well studied. Although these fitness/frailty scores have 
shaped our understanding of the heterogeneity among older adults with myeloma, 
the application of such scores in treatment decision making (ie, transplant 
considerations, relapse) is an unmet need. Here we outline how to incorporate 
frailty assessments in the evaluation of older adults with MM in the clinical 
setting with consideration of other factors such as patient preferences, 
treatment risks/benefits, life expectancy, and disease biology.

With improvements in medical care, the life expectancy of patients with bleeding 
disorders is approaching that of the general population. A growing population of 
older adult patients with bleeding disorders is at risk of age-related 
comorbidities and in need of various elective and emergent age-related 
procedures. The increased risk of thrombosis and volume overload in older adults 
complicates perioperative hemostatic management. Furthermore, antithrombotic 
treatment such as antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, which is frequently 
required for various cardiovascular interventions, requires a meticulous 
individualized approach. Evidence-based guidelines for the management of aging 
patients with bleeding disorders are lacking, largely due to the 
underrepresentation of older adult patients in clinical trials as well as the 
rarity of many such bleeding disorders. We discuss the current guidelines and 
recommendations in the perioperative hemostatic management of older adult 
patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand disease as well as other rare 
bleeding disorders. The optimal management of these patients is often complex 
and requires a thorough multidisciplinary and individualized approach involving 
hematologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and the specialists treating the 
underlying disorder.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) a life-limiting inherited disease affecting a 
number of organs, but classically associated with chronic lung infection and 
progressive loss of lung function. Chronic infection by Burkholderia cepacia 
complex (BCC) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and therefore 
represents a significant challenge to clinicians treating people with CF. This 
review examines the current evidence for long-term antibiotic therapy in people 
with CF and chronic BCC infection.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to assess the effects of long-term 
oral and inhaled antibiotic therapy targeted against chronic BCC lung infections 
in people with CF. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of treatments 
in terms of improvements in lung function and reductions in exacerbation rate. 
Secondary objectives include quantifying adverse events, mortality and changes 
in quality of life associated with treatment.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, 
compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and 
conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the 
reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 12 April 
2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of long-term antibiotic 
therapy in people with CF and chronic BCC infection.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data, assessed 
risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We included one RCT (100 participants) which lasted 52 weeks 
comparing continuous inhaled aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and placebo in a 
double-blind RCT for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week open-label extension and a 
four-week follow-up period. The average participant age was 26.3 years, 61% were 
male and average lung function was 56.5% predicted. Treatment with AZLI for 24 
weeks was not associated with improvement in forced expiratory volume in one 
second (FEV1), mean difference 0.91% (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.15 to 
4.97) (moderate-quality evidence). The median time to the next exacerbation was 
75 days in the AZLI group compared to 51 days in the placebo group, but the 
difference was not significant (P = 0.27) (moderate-quality evidence). 
Similarly, the number of participants hospitalised for respiratory exacerbations 
showed no difference between groups, risk ratio (RR) 0.88 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.45) 
(moderate-quality evidence). Overall adverse events were similar between groups, 
RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.19) (moderate-quality evidence). There were no 
significant differences between treatment groups in relation to mortality 
(moderate-quality evidence), quality of life or sputum density. In relation to 
methodological quality, the overall risk of bias in the study was assessed to be 
unclear to low risk.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found insufficient evidence from the literature to 
determine an effective strategy for antibiotic therapy for treating chronic BCC 
infection.

AIMS: To develop a model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 4 mg dibotermin 
alfa/absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) versus iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) in 
patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease in the United Kingdom.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to 
calculate costs and quality-adjusted life-years over a 4-year time horizon in 
each treatment group, from a United Kingdom National Health Service perspective. 
An individual patient data meta-analysis was undertaken to synthesize data from 
four randomized controlled trials and two single-arm studies concerning 
health-related quality of life and procedural resource use. Current cost data 
from the United Kingdom were then applied to determine the overall mean cost per 
patient in each group. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
undertaken to explore the impact of parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The model predicted 4-year discounted cost savings of £192 per patient 
treated with dibotermin alfa/ACS, compared with ICBG, and a gain of 0.0114 QALYs 
per patient over the same time period. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the 
results were most sensitive to variability in the differences in health-related 
quality of life and secondary surgery rate, with dibotermin alfa/ACS having a 
60% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20,000 per QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: There is uncertainty in the difference in cost and QALYs between 
the two groups. However, comprehensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken to 
explore this and present the results in a transparent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide an economic case for the use of 4 mg dibotermin 
alfa/ACS versus iliac crest bone graft, with additional health benefits 
predicted at reduced overall cost.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The increased use of hypofractionated radiotherapy changes 
department activity. While expected to be cost-effective, departments' fixed 
costs may impede savings. Understanding radiotherapy's cost-drivers, to what 
extent these are fixed and consequences of reducing activity can help to inform 
reimbursement strategies.
MATERIAL/METHODS: We estimate the cost of radiotherapy provision, using 
time-driven activity-based costing, for five bone metastases treatment 
strategies, in a large NHS provider. We compare these estimations to 
reimbursement tariff and assess their breakdown by cost types: fixed 
(buildings), semi-fixed (staff, linear accelerators) and variable (materials) 
costs. Sensitivity analyses assess the cost-drivers and impact of reducing 
departmental activity on the costs of remaining treatments, with varying 
disinvestment assumptions.
RESULTS: The estimated radiotherapy cost for bone metastases ranges from 430.95€ 
(single fraction) to 4240.76€ (45 Gy in 25#). Provider costs align closely with 
NHS reimbursement, except for the stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) 
strategy (tariff exceeding by 15.3%). Semi-fixed staff costs account for 
28.1-39.7% and fixed/semi-fixed equipment/space costs 38.5-54.8% of provider 
costs. Departmental activity is the biggest cost-driver; reduction in activity 
increasing cost, predominantly in fractionated treatments. Decommissioning 
linear accelerators ameliorates this, although can only be realised at equipment 
capacity thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Hypofractionation is less burdensome to patients and long-term 
offers a cost-efficient mechanism to treat an increasing number of patients 
within existing capacity. As a large majority of treatment costs are 
fixed/semi-fixed, disinvestment is complex, within the life expectancy of a 
linac, imbalances between demand and capacity will result in higher treatment 
costs. With a per-fraction reimbursement, this may disincentivise delivery of 
hypofractionated treatments.

Treating Electrical and Biopotential Artifacts in an EEG Pilot Study Experiment.

Nicolae IE, Sultana AE, Aursulesei R, Fulop S.

With the increase in life expectancy, as well as in the performance and 
complexity of healthcare systems, the need for fast and accurate information has 
also grown. EEG devices have become more accessible and necessary in clinical 
practice. In daily activity, artifacts are ubiquitous in EEG signals. They arise 
from: environmental, experimental and physiological factors, degrade signal 
quality and render the affected part of the signal useless. This paper proposes 
an artifact cleaning pipeline including filters and algorithms to streamline the 
analysis process. Moreover, to better characterize and discriminate artifacts 
from useful EEG data, additional physiological signals and video data are used, 
which are correlated with subject's behavior. We quantify the performance 
reached by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and clinical visual inspection. The entire 
research and data collection took place in the laboratories of XPERI 
Corporation.Clinical Relevance-Since the occurrence of artifacts cannot be 
controlled, it is essential to have a precise process of recognition, 
identification and elimination of noise. Therefore, it is important to 
distinguish EEG artifacts from abnormal activity in order to minimize the chance 
of EEG misinterpretation, that can lead to false diagnosis, especially regarding 
the study of epileptiform activities or other neurologic or psychiatric 
disorders (e.g. degenerative diseases, dementia, depression, sleep disorders, 
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, etc.).

A Hand Exoskeleton for Stroke Survivors' Activities of Daily Life().

Ghassemi M, Kamper DG.

Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Hand impairment is a common 
consequence of stroke, potentially impacting all facets of life as the hands are 
the primary means of interacting with the world. Typically, therapy is the 
prescribed treatment after stroke. However, a majority of stroke survivors have 
limited recovery and thus chronic impairment. Assistive, rather than 
therapeutic, devices may help these individuals restore lost function and 
improve independence and engagement in society. Current assistive devices, 
however, typically fail to address the greatest barriers to successful use with 
stroke survivors. In the hand, weakness and incoordination arise from a 
seemingly paradoxical combination of limited voluntary activation of muscles and 
involuntary neuromuscular hyperexcitability. Thus, profound strength deficits 
can be accompanied by substantial forces opposing the intended movement. The 
assistive device presented in this paper can provide both sufficient flexion and 
extension assistance to overcome these barriers. A single actuator for each 
digit provides flexion or extension assistance through push-pull cables guided 
along the dorsal side of the hand. User intent can be decoded from 
Electromyographic (EMG) signals to drive the device throughout the movement. EMG 
control is customized to the capabilities of each user by examining the 
voluntary EMG workspace.

Electromyography and Inertial Motion Sensors Based Wearable Data Acquisition 
System for Stroke Patients: A Pilot Study.

Khan MA, Bayram BM, Das R, Puthusserypady S.

Development of wearable data acquisition systems with applications to 
human-machine interaction (HMI) is of great interest to assist stroke patients 
or people with motor disabilities. This paper proposes a hybrid wireless data 
acquisition system, which combines surface electromyography (sEMG) and inertial 
measurement unit (IMU) sensors. It is designed to interface wrist extension with 
external devices, which allows the user to operate devices with hand 
orientations. A pilot study of the system performed on four healthy subjects has 
successfully produced two different control signals corresponding to wrist 
extensions. Preliminary results show a high correlation (0.42-0.75) between sEMG 
and IMU signals, thus proving the feasibility of such a system. Results also 
show that the developed system is robust as well as less susceptible to external 
interferences. The generated control signals can be used to perform real-time 
control of different devices in daily-life activities, such as turning ON/OFF of 
lights in a smart home, controlling an electric wheelchair, and other assistive 
devices. Such a system will help decrease the dependency of disabled people on 
their caretakers and empower them to perform their daily-life activities 
independently.

Evaluation of Orthostatic Reactions in Real-World Environments Using Wearable 
Sensors.

Happold J, Richer R, Kuderle A, Gabner H, Klucken J, Eskofier BM, Kluge F.

As global life expectancy is constantly rising, the early detection of 
age-related, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, is 
becoming increasingly important. Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease 
often show autonomic nervous system dysfunction which is why its examination is 
an important diagnostic tool. Measuring the response of the heart rate 
(variability) to postural transitions and thereby assessing the orthostatic 
reaction is a common indicator of autonomic nervous system functioning. However, 
since these measurements are commonly performed in a clinical environment, 
results can be impaired by the white coat effect. To reduce this influence as 
well as inter- and intra-day variations, our work aims to investigate the 
assessment of orthostatic reactions in free-living environments. We collected 
IMU and ECG data of seven healthy participants over four days and evaluated 
differences in orthostatic reactions between standardized tests at lab, at home, 
as well as unsupervised recordings during real-world conditions. Except for the 
first lab recording, we detected significant changes in heart rate due to 
postural transitions in all recording settings, with the strongest response 
occurring during standardized tests at home. Our findings show that real-world 
assessment of orthostatic reactions is possible and provides comparable results 
to supervised assessments in lab settings. Additionally, our results indicate 
high inter- and intra-day variability which motivates the continuous orthostatic 
reaction measurement over the span of multiple days. We are convinced that our 
presented approach provides a first step towards unobtrusive assessment of 
orthostatic reactions in real-world environments, which might enable a more 
reliable early detection of disorders of the autonomic nervous system.

BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain (PFP) affects one-third of adolescents and can 
persist into adulthood, negatively impacting health and quality of life. Foot 
orthoses are a recommended treatment for adults with PFP, but have not been 
evaluated in adolescents. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility 
of conducting a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating effects 
of contoured, prefabricated foot orthoses on knee pain severity and 
patient-perceived global change, compared to flat insoles. The secondary 
objective was to describe outcomes on a range of patient-reported outcome 
measures.
METHODS: We recruited adolescents aged 12-18 years with PFP of ≥2 months 
duration into a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group feasibility trial. 
Participants were randomised to receive prefabricated contoured foot orthoses or 
flat shoe insoles, and followed for 3 months. Participants and outcome assessors 
were blinded to group allocation. Primary outcomes were feasibility of a 
full-scale RCT (number of eligible/enrolled volunteers; recruitment rate; 
adherence with the intervention and logbook completion; adverse effects; success 
of blinding; drop-out rate), and credibility and expectancy of interventions. 
Secondary outcomes were patient-reported measures of pain, symptoms, function, 
quality of life, global rating of change, patient acceptable symptom state, and 
use of co-interventions.
RESULTS: 36 out of 279 (12.9%) volunteers (27 female, mean (SD) age 15 (2) 
years, body mass 60 (13) kg) were eligible and enrolled, at a recruitment rate 
of 1.2 participants/week. 17 participants were randomised to receive foot 
orthoses, and 19 to flat insoles. 15 participants returned logbooks; 7/15 (47%) 
adhered to the intervention. No serious adverse events were reported. 28% 
(10/36, 4 pandemic-related) of participants dropped out before 3 months. 
Blinding was successful. Both groups found the inserts to be credible.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a priori criteria for feasibility, findings suggest that a 
full-scale RCT comparing contoured foot orthoses to flat insoles in adolescents 
with PFP would not be feasible using the current protocol. Prior to conducting a 
full-scale RCT, feasibility issues should be addressed, with protocol 
modifications to facilitate participant retention, logbook completion and shoe 
insert wear.

As human life expectancy increases substantially and aging is the primary risk 
factor for most chronic diseases, there is an urgent need for advancing the 
development of post-genomic era biomarkers that can be used for disease 
prediction and early detection (DPED). Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (LOY) is the 
state of nullisomy Y in sub-groups of somatic cells acquired from different 
post-zygotic development stages and onwards throughout the lifespan. Multiple 
large-cohort based epidemiology studies have found that LOY in blood cells is a 
significant risk factor for future mortality and various diseases in males. Many 
features intrinsic to LOY analysis may be leveraged to enhance its use as a 
non-invasive, sensitive, reliable, high throughput-biomarker for DPED. Here, we 
review the emerging literatures in LOY studies and highlight ten strengths for 
using LOY as a novel biomarker for genomics-driven DPED diagnostics. Meanwhile, 
the current limitations in this area are also discussed. We conclude by 
identifying some important knowledge gaps regarding the consequences of 
malsegregation of the Y chromosome and propose further steps that are required 
before clinical implementation of LOY. Taken together, we think that LOY has 
substantial potential as a biomarker for DPED, despite some hurdles that still 
need to be addressed before its integration into healthcare becomes acceptable.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The relationship between dynamic changes in metabolic 
syndrome (MetS) status and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has not 
been reliably quantified. This study aimed to estimate lifetime risk of CVD and 
life expectancy with and without CVD according to dynamic MetS status.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Dynamic changes in MetS status were assessed: MetS-free, 
MetS-chronic, MetS-developed, and MetS-recovery groups. We used Modified 
Kaplan-Meier method to estimate lifetime risk and used multistate life table 
method to calculate life expectancy. Participants free of CVD at index ages 35 
(n = 40 168), 45 (n = 33 569), and 55 (n = 18 546) years. At index age 35 years, 
we recorded 1341 CVD events during a median follow-up of 6.1 years. Lifetime 
risk of 33.9% (95% CI: 26.9%-41.0%) in MetS-recovery group was lower than that 
of 39.4% (95% CI: 36.1%-42.8%) in MetS-chronic group. Lifetime risk of 37.8% 
(95% CI: 30.6%-45.1%) in MetS-developed group was higher than that of 26.4% (95% 
CI: 22.7%-30.0%) in MetS-free group. At index age 35 years, life expectancy free 
of CVD for MetS-recovery group (44.1 years) was higher than that for 
MetS-chronic group (38.8 years). Life expectancy free of CVD for MetS-developed 
group (41.9 years) was lower than that for MetS-free group (46.7 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from MetS was associated with decreased lifetime risk of 
CVD and a longer life expectancy free of CVD, whereas development of MetS was 
associated with increased lifetime risk of CVD and a shorter life expectancy 
free of CVD.

The identification of nonenzymatic pathways for nucleic acid replication is a 
key challenge in understanding the origin of life. We have previously shown that 
nonenzymatic RNA primer extension using 2-aminoimidazole (2AI) activated 
nucleotides occurs primarily through an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide 
intermediate. The reactive nature and preorganized structure of the intermediate 
increase the efficiency of primer extension but remain insufficient to drive 
extensive copying of RNA templates containing all four canonical nucleotides. To 
understand the factors that limit RNA copying, we synthesized all ten 
2AI-bridged dinucleotide intermediates and measured the kinetics of primer 
extension in a model system. The affinities of the ten dinucleotides for the 
primer/template/helper complexes vary by over 7,000-fold, consistent with 
nearest neighbor energetic predictions. Surprisingly, the reaction rates at 
saturating intermediate concentrations still vary by over 15-fold, with the most 
weakly binding dinucleotides exhibiting a lower maximal reaction rate. Certain 
noncanonical nucleotides can decrease sequence dependent differences in affinity 
and primer extension rate, while monomers bridged to short oligonucleotides 
exhibit enhanced binding and reaction rates. We suggest that more uniform 
binding and reactivity of imidazolium-bridged intermediates may lead to the 
ability to copy arbitrary template sequences under prebiotically plausible 
conditions.

Desmoteplase is a bat (Desmodus rotundus) saliva-derived fibrinolytic enzyme 
resembling a urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator. It is highly dependent 
on fibrin and has some neuroprotective attributes. Intravenous administration of 
desmoteplase is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects. Plasma fibrinolytic 
activity is linearly related to its blood concentration, its terminal 
elimination half-life ranges from 3.8 to 4.92 h (50 vs. 90 μg/kg dose). 
Administration of desmoteplase leads to transitory derangement of fibrinogen, 
D-dimer, alpha2-antiplasmin, and plasmin and antiplasmin complex which normalize 
within 4-12 h. It does not alter a prothrombin test, international normalized 
ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin fragment 1.2. 
Desmoteplase was tested in myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism and 
showed promising results versus alteplase. In ischemic stroke trials, 
desmoteplase was linked to increased rates of symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhages and case fatality. However, data from "The desmoteplase in Acute 
Ischemic Stroke" Trials, DIAS-3 and DIAS-J, suggest that the drug is well 
tolerated and its safety profile is comparable to placebo. Desmoteplase is 
theoretically a superior thrombolytic because of high fibrin specificity, no 
activation of beta-amyloid, and lack of neurotoxicity. It was associated with 
better outcomes in patients with significant stenosis or occlusion of a proximal 
precerebral vessels. However, DIAS-4 was stopped as it might have not reached 
its primary endpoint. Due to its promising properties, desmoteplase may be added 
into treatment of ischemic stroke with extension of the time window and special 
emphasis on patients presenting outside the 4.5-h thrombolysis window, with 
wake-up strokes and strokes of unknown onset.

BACKGROUND: Noninvasive remote patient management (RPM) in patients with heart 
failure (HF) has been shown to reduce the days lost due to unplanned 
cardiovascular hospital admissions and all-cause mortality in the Telemedical 
Interventional Management in Heart Failure II trial (TIM-HF2). The health 
economic implications of these findings are the focus of the present analyses 
from the payer perspective.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1538 participants of the TIM-HF2 randomized 
controlled trial were assigned to the RPM and Usual Care group. Health claims 
data were available for 1450 patients (n = 715 RPM group, n = 735 Usual Care 
group), which represents 94.3% of the original TIM-HF2 patient population, were 
linked to primary data from the study documentation and evaluated in terms of 
the health care cost, total cost (accounting for intervention costs), costs per 
day alive and out of hospital (DAOH), and cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). The average health care costs per patient year amounted to € 14,412 (95% 
CI 13,284-15,539) in the RPM group and € 17,537 (95% CI 16,179-18,894) in the UC 
group. RPM led to cost savings of € 3125 per patient year (p = 0.001). After 
including the intervention costs, a cost saving of € 1758 per patient year 
remained (p = 0.048).
CONCLUSION: The additional noninvasive telemedical interventional management in 
patients with HF was cost-effective compared to standard care alone, since such 
intervention was associated with overall cost savings and superior clinical 
effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening illness. Sometimes long 
inpatient treatment is necessary, increasing the anxiety that comes with 
hospitalization and the necessary weight gain. Safe, non-pharmacological 
adjunctive therapies that improve subjective health are called for.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this non-randomized, mixed-methods observational study was 
to describe the utilization rate and nurses' experiences of ear acupuncture in a 
highly specialized clinic for eating disorders in Sweden, in which acupuncture 
had been implemented as part of routine clinical care. Twenty-five patients with 
AN-treated voluntarily or by law were included. The semi-standardized National 
Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) ear acupuncture protocol, 
sometimes combined with needling at 2 traditional acupuncture point locations on 
the body, had been implemented as a voluntary adjunct to usual care, twice 
weekly. To evaluate the acceptance of acupuncture, the study examined how often 
patients chose acupuncture when offered on schedule, and how often they asked 
for extra acupuncture sessions. Patients rated their subjective health using the 
hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and visual analogue scale (VAS), 
treatment satisfaction with usual care and acupuncture, and health-related 
quality of life with the RAND36 instrument. A credibility/expectancy 
questionnaire (CEQ) was used to measure confidence in treatment. Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated to follow the patients' recovery. Nurses' experiences of 
giving acupuncture as a part of routine care were captured in interviews, and 
analysed with content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained.
RESULTS: Despite an initially moderate level of trust in acupuncture, the 
utilization rate of the scheduled acupuncture was 89% and patients asked for 
extra acupuncture sessions on 28 occasions. No serious side effects were 
reported. Nurses' experiences of providing acupuncture were positive. They were 
generally enthusiastic, although they reported finding it difficult to organize 
group treatments and to find time for acupuncture sessions if they were not 
scheduled.
CONCLUSION: Further research into the effectiveness and costs of acupuncture in 
psychiatric care is needed. This study provides relevant information for 
clinicians as well as researchers planning future randomized controlled trials.

Background: The increase in life expectancy and in the number of individuals 
over 60 years old brings new demands to health professionals and services based 
on the physiological changes that occur in this population. The aging process 
results in changes in body composition, increasing body fat and reducing muscle 
mass, in addition to a reduction in bone mass. Aim: The aim of this study was to 
examine the effect of whey protein and vitamin D supplementation on body 
composition and skeletal muscle in older adults living in long-term care 
facilities. Methods: This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. 
Thirty older adults (>60 years old) were randomized and allocated in three 
groups: group receiving resistance training and supplementation receiving 
resistance training, whey protein and vitamin D; group received resistance and 
placebo training receiving resistance training and placebo, and control group 
without any intervention. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Results: The mean age was 
74.87 (± 8.14) years. A significant difference (p = 0.042) was observed between 
the group receiving resistance training and supplementation and control groups 
in relation to lean mass increase (kg) at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks of 
intervention, there was a significant increase in Relative index of muscle mass 
for the two groups that underwent resistance training, group received resistance 
and placebo training (p = 0.042) and group receiving resistance training and 
supplementation (p = 0.045), in relation to the control. Conclusion: Combined 
supplementation of whey protein and vitamin D with resistance training can 
significantly improve lean mass, total mass, and relative index of muscle mass 
in institutionalized older adults.

The price of curing cancer.

Gandjour A(1).

BACKGROUND: Health care systems around the world struggle with high prices for 
new cancer drugs. The purpose of this study was to conduct a gedankenexperiment 
and calculate how much health expenditures would change if a cure for cancer 
through pharmaceutical treatment were made available. The cancer cure was 
conceived to eliminate both cancer deaths and the underlying morbidity burden of 
cancer. Furthermore, the cure was hypothesized to arrive in incremental steps 
but at infinitesimally small time intervals (resulting, effectively, in an 
immediate cure).
METHODS: The analysis used secondary data and was conducted from the viewpoint 
of the German social health insurance. As its underlying method, it used a 
cause-elimination life-table approach. To account for the age distribution of 
the population, the study weighted age-specific increases in remaining life 
expectancy by age-specific population sizes. It considered drug acquisition 
costs as well as savings and life extension costs from eliminating cancer. All 
cancer drugs that underwent a mandatory early benefit assessment in Germany 
between 2011 and 2015/16 and were granted an added benefit were included. Data 
on age- and gender-specific probabilities of survival, population sizes, causes 
of death, and health expenditures, as well as data on cancer costs were taken 
from the German Federal Office of Statistics and the German Federal Social 
Insurance Office.
RESULTS: Based on the cause-elimination life-table approach and accounting for 
the age structure of the German population, curing cancer in Germany yields an 
increase in average remaining life expectancy by 2.66 life years. Based on the 
current incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of new cancer drugs, which is on 
average €101,493 per life year gained (€39,751/0.39 life years), the German 
social health insurance would need to pay €280,497 per insuree to eliminate 
cancer. Dividing this figure by current average remaining lifetime health 
expenditures yields a ratio of 2.07, which represents a multiplier of current 
health expenditures.
CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating cancer at current price levels would more than triple 
total health expenditures in Germany. As the current price of a cure requires a 
drastic reduction of non-health consumption, it appears that current prices for 
cancer drugs already on the market (i.e., small steps towards a cure) need
