Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation – History, Current Guidelines and 
Implications for the Future.

[Article in English, German]

Silaschi M, Treede H.

Degenerative aortic stenosis is a disease of the elderly and of growing 
importance in an ageing population. Due to the impaired life-expectancy of 
patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, valve replacement should be 
performed. Surgical aortic valve replacement is the gold standard treatment; 
however, median sternotomy and use of extracorporal circulation is a risk for 
elderly patients with comorbidities. The introduction of transcatheter aortic 
valve implantation (TAVI) into clinical practice has revolutionized treatment of 
aortic stenosis in elderly patients. In most patients, TAVI can be performed 
through the groin vessels using local anaesthesia. Most patients fully recover 
within a few days. Current debate focuses on whether TAVI should also be used to 
treat younger patients as data on long-term durability of these valves is 
insufficient and there is a remaining risk of paravalvular leackage.

INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, incurable disease 
associated with decreased life expectancy and a marked impact on quality of life 
(QoL). There are three classes of drugs available for treatment: endothelin 
receptor antagonists (ERA), drugs acting on nitric oxide pathway (riociguat and 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors [PDE5i]), and drugs acting on prostacyclin 
pathway. The latter have widely different modes of administration - continuous 
intravenous infusion, continuous subcutaneous infusion, inhaled, and oral - each 
associated with variable treatment burden, and implications for health economic 
assessment. This study aimed to establish utility values associated with 
different modes of administration of drugs acting on the prostacyclin pathway 
for use in economic evaluations of PAH treatments.
METHODS: A UK general public sample completed the EQ-5D-5L and valued four 
health states in time trade-off interviews. The health states drafted from 
literature and interviews with PAH experts (n=3) contained identical 
descriptions of PAH and ERA/PDE5i treatment, but differed in description of 
administration including oral (tablets), inhaled (nebulizer), continuous 
subcutaneous infusion, and continuous intravenous infusion.
RESULTS: A total of 150 participants (63% female; mean age 37 years) completed 
interviews. Utilities are presented as values between 0 and 1, with 0 
representing the state of being dead and 1 representing being in full health. 
The mean (SD) utility for oral health state was 0.85 (0.16), while all other 
health states were significantly lower at 0.74 (0.27) for inhaled (p=0.001), 
0.59 (0.31) for subcutaneous (p<0.001) and 0.54 (0.32) for intravenous 
(p<0.001), indicating that there are disutilities (negative differences) 
associated with non-oral health states. Disutilities were -0.11 for inhaled, 
-0.26 for subcutaneous, and -0.31 for intravenous administration.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate quantifiable QoL differences between modes 
of administration of drugs acting on the prostacyclin pathway. QoL burden should 
be considered for economic evaluation of drugs for PAH treatment.

INTRODUCTION: People with spinal cord injury (SCI) are getting older due to a 
combination of increased life expectancy and older age at the time of injury. 
This trend makes it more likely for these patients to have other chronic health 
conditions including cancer. Inevitably relatively rare cancers such as soft 
tissue sarcomas (STS), which are more common with advancing age, will occur in 
some SCI patients. The present case represents the first report of a limb STS in 
a patient with chronic paraplegia from a traumatic SCI.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 50-year-old right handed male with a T6 
chronic, complete SCI (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A) 
who presented with a large mass involving his right shoulder musculature that 
was determined to be a high grade spindle cell sarcoma. The patient was followed 
closely by Physiatry over an approximately 6-month time course including prior 
to his tumor diagnosis, during the pre-radiation and pre-surgical planning 
phase, and then post-operatively for his acute inpatient rehabilitation. He was 
successfully discharged home to live alone in his accessible apartment complex.
DISCUSSION: This case is the first ever reported case of a person living with a 
traumatic SCI who subsequently developed a limb STS. In addition to its novelty, 
this case illustrates how health conditions such as rare cancers are presenting 
more often as the chronic SCI population is getting older, which creates both 
unique diagnostic and management challenges for cancer rehabilitation 
specialists.

Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle weakness disease involving in 
inherited genetic conditions. MD is caused by mutations or alteration in the 
genes responsible for the structure and functioning of muscles. There are many 
different types of MD which have a wide range from mild symptoms to severe 
disability. Some types involve the muscles used for breathing which eventually 
affect life expectancy. This chapter provides an overview of the MD types, its 
gene mutations, and the Drosophila MD models. Specifically, the Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common form of MD, will be thoroughly 
discussed including Dystrophin genes, their isoforms, possible mechanisms, and 
signaling pathways of pathogenesis.

Deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate was synthesized with 3-oxo-2 H-pyridazin-6-yl 
(PzO)-a uracil analogue lacking a 2-keto group-as the nucleobase. Theoretical 
analyses and hybridization experiments indicated that PzO recognizes adenine (A) 
for formation of a Watson-Crick base pair. Primer extension reactions using 
nucleoside 5'-triphosphate and the Klenow fragment revealed that the synthetic 
nucleoside 5'-triphosphate was incorporated into the 3' end of the primer 
through recognition of A in the template strand. Moreover, the 3'-nucleotide 
residue harboring PzO as the base was resistant to the 3'-exonuclease activity 
of Klenow fragment exo+. The primer bearing the PzO base at the 3' end could 
function in subsequent chain elongation. These properties of PzO were attributed 
to the presence of an endocyclic nitrogen atom at the position ortho to the 
glycosidic bond, which was presumed to form an H-bond with the amino acid 
residue of DNA polymerase for effective recognition of the 3' end of the primer 
for primer extension. These results provide a basis for designing new 
nucleobases by combining a nitrogen atom at the position ortho to the glycosidic 
bond and base-pairing sites for Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding.

BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of 
vision loss in the United States. The most severe vision loss occurs in patients 
with neovascular AMD, known as wet AMD (wAMD). The most commonly used 
antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies approved by the FDA to 
treat patients with wAMD are ranibizumab, 0.5 mg administered by intravitreal 
injection once a month (approximately every 28 days), and intravitreal 
aflibercept injection (IAI), 2 mg every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 12 weeks 
(3 months), followed by IAI 2 mg once every 8 weeks (2 months). Given the 
similar efficacy and safety profiles between IAI and ranibizumab, their 
associated costs and comparative cost-effectiveness are key factors in 
determining which one represents a more rational investment of scarce health 
care resources to help address the increasing cost of prescription drugs in the 
United States, a source of concern for patients, prescribers, payers, and 
policymakers.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal aflibercept 
injection 2 mg every 8 weeks after 3 initial monthly doses (IAI 2q8) versus 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly (Rq4) and pro re nata (PRN) in the treatment of 
patients with wAMD from a U.S. payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to estimate the lifetime 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs of treating patients with wAMD 
with IAI 2q8, Rq4, and ranibizumab PRN. The model considered changes in 
best-corrected visual acuity in the affected and fellow eyes over time, and the 
effect of blindness on mortality. Efficacy for IAI 2q8 and Rq4 was from VIEW 1 
and VIEW 2 studies and from the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials for 
ranibizumab PRN. Utilities and costs (in 2016 U.S. dollars) were from published 
literature. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3%.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, IAI 2q8 provided equal health benefits with Rq4 (5.44 
QALYs) at a lower total cost ($33,745 vs. $48,031) as a result of fewer 
injections. IAI 2q8 yielded slightly greater QALYs versus ranibizumab PRN (5.44 
vs. 5.40) at a slightly higher cost ($33,745 vs. $33,652), with an incremental 
cost per QALY gained of $2,583. Results were sensitive to variations in drug 
acquisition costs and number of injections of both drugs and the baseline age of 
the cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: IAI 2q8 can be cost saving and cost-effective compared with Rq4 and 
ranibizumab PRN for the treatment of wAMD in the United States.

Hemophilia Burden of Disease: A Systematic Review of the Cost-Utility Literature 
for Hemophilia.

Massachusetts.

BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis with clotting factor replacement products is recommended 
by the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the National Hemophilia 
Foundation as the optimal therapy for the prevention of bleeding episodes in 
individuals with severe hemophilia A or B (< 1 IU per dL endogenous factor VIII 
or factor IX activity, respectively). Prophylaxis is associated with an improved 
health-related quality of life and has been shown to be cost-effective compared 
with on-demand therapy. However, the overall cost of treatment remains high, 
particularly among patients with a greater propensity to bleed. The overall 
value of hemophilia treatments and their associated benefits, measured in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and dollar costs compared with other 
interventions can be evaluated through the use of cost-utility analyses (CUAs). 
Previous CUA studies in hemophilia have focused primarily on patients with more 
severe forms of hemophilia and on prophylaxis compared with on-demand treatment. 
However, to our knowledge, no studies to date have utilized QALYs as a 
standardized outcome measure to systematically evaluate the relative 
cost-effectiveness of current hemophilia treatment options.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the CUA literature of hemophilia treatments 
and demonstrate the challenges in producing cost-utility evidence compared with 
other rare diseases.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review using the Tufts Medical 
Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and the National Health Service 
Economic Evaluation Database for English-language CUAs published from 2000 
through 2015 with the search terms hemophilia, haemophilia, factor VIII, or 
factor IX. Two trained reviewers independently reviewed every study to extract 
relevant data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were converted to 2014 U.S. 
dollars using exchange rates for currency conversion and the Consumer Price 
Index to adjust for inflation.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 52 studies, 11 of which met our inclusion criteria. 
The cost-effectiveness of hemophilia treatments varied widely based on 
variations in the study designs, including differences in time horizon, discount 
rates, and medical interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: We found the cost-effectiveness of hemophilia treatments to be 
broadly comparable to that of other orphan drugs. Improved standardization of 
future CUA studies will be important for further evaluation of the 
cost-effectiveness of hemophilia treatments.

23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in an adult population in South 
Korea.

In South Korea, the National Immunization Program offers a 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) for the elderly; however, the 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is not included, and 
vaccination is not offered to younger, at-risk populations. This study offers a 
comparative analysis of PCV13 and PPSV23 in Korea's adults, stratified by age 
and risk group. A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed from the 
healthcare perspective. Data sources included the Health Insurance Review & 
Assessment Service, Korea Centre for Disease Control & Prevention and Korean 
medical institutions. An expert panel tested data validity. The CAPiTA trial and 
Cochrane meta-analysis were used to obtain vaccine effectiveness data. 
Regardless of co-morbidity, when the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy was 
compared to that using PPSV23-only, in elderly populations, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 3,300 USD per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY). For the risk group aged ≥65 years, the ICER of the addition of PCV13 
over the existing PPSV23-only strategy was 3,404 USD/QALY. However, on replacing 
PPSV23 with PCV13, for all elderly populations, an ICER of 1,421 USD/QALY 
resulted; for the risk group aged ≥65 years, the ICER was 1,736 USD/QALY. For 
the 18-64 year-old risk group, the sequential PCV13-PPSV23 strategy yielded an 
ICER of 3,629 USD/QALY over the PPSV23-only strategy, and 6,643 USD/QALY 
compared to no vaccination. Thus, the PCV13→PPSV23 combination strategy for 
elderly populations was found to be a cost-effective alternative to the current 
National Immunization Program regardless of co-morbidity. This finding was the 
same as that for younger, at-risk populations.

Obesity is a chronic and debilitating disease that has become a global epidemic. 
Especially severe in the Unites States, obesity currently affects almost 40% of 
the population. Obesity has a strong causal relationship with numerous serious 
comorbidities that impair quality of life, shorten life expectancy, and carry a 
major economic burden. Obesity has particular relevance to cardiologists because 
it contributes directly to several major cardiovascular diseases and, 
consequently, increases overall cardiovascular mortality. Multiple treatment 
options are available, but metabolic and bariatric surgery offers the most 
effective and durable treatment for obesity. Moreover, metabolic and bariatric 
operations alleviate and often completely eliminate numerous comorbidities, 
particularly type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as 
hypertension and dyslipidemia. With their low risk of complications and 
morbidity, metabolic and bariatric operations significantly improve quality of 
life and overall survival, particularly reducing death due to cardiovascular 
disease.

BACKGROUND: National guidelines require programmes use subjective assessments of 
social support when determining transplant suitability, despite limited evidence 
linking it to outcomes. We examined how transplant providers weigh the 
importance of social support for kidney transplantation compared with other 
factors, and variation by clinical role and personal beliefs.
METHODS: The National survey of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and 
the Society of Transplant Social Work in 2016. Using a discrete choice approach, 
respondents compared two hypothetical patient profiles and selected one for 
transplantation. Conditional logistic regression estimated the relative 
importance of each factor; results were stratified by clinical role 
(psychosocial vs medical/surgical providers) and beliefs (outcomes vs equity).
RESULTS: Five hundred and eighy-four transplant providers completed the survey. 
Social support was the second most influential factor among transplant 
providers. Providers were most likely to choose a candidate who had social 
support (OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.86), always adhered to a medical regimen 
(OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.88), and had a 15 years life expectancy with 
transplant (OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.85). Psychosocial providers were more 
influenced by adherence and quality of life compared with medical/surgical 
providers, who were more influenced by candidates' life expectancy with 
transplant (p<0.05). For providers concerned with avoiding organ waste, social 
support was the most influential factor, while it was the least influential for 
clinicians concerned with fairness (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Social support is highly influential in listing decisions and may 
exacerbate transplant disparities. Providers' beliefs and reliance on social 
support in determining suitability vary considerably, raising concerns about 
transparency and justice.

Background: Nutrition is critical to HIV mortality and morbidity. Improved 
treatment modalities have increased life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals. 
More than 1 million US adults are living with HIV, but little is known about 
their nutritional status. Objective: We aimed to characterize the nutritional 
status of those living with HIV with the use of the NHANES 2003-2014. Methods: 
The NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of the US 
population and includes a household interview, medical examination, and two 24-h 
dietary recalls; survey weights are applied to make the data nationally 
representative. HIV antibodies were ascertained initially by immunoassay and 
confirmed with Western blot. NHANES 2003-2014 data were analyzed for 
HIV-positive (n = 87) and HIV-negative (n = 15,868) US adults (aged 19-49 y). 
Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, dietary intakes, and nutritional 
biomarkers were estimated and compared by HIV status, stratified by sex. 
Results: HIV-infected men and women had higher serum protein, lower serum 
albumin, and lower serum folate than did non-HIV-infected adults. HIV-positive 
women had significantly higher BMI, prevalence of overweight or obesity, and 
waist circumference risk and substantially lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
concentrations (44 compared with 65 nmol/L) than did HIV-negative women. When 
compared with HIV-negative women, HIV-positive women had lower intakes of some 
key nutrients such as fiber, vitamin E, vitamin K, magnesium, and potassium but 
had higher intakes of protein and niacin. Conclusions: The NHANES data suggest 
that HIV infection is associated with poorer markers of some nutritional status 
indicators; however, the US population prevalence of HIV is <0.5%. Given the 
small sample size, not only in this study but also in the United States, much 
more targeted research is needed to better understand the multitude of factors

Olfaction plays an important role in human social communication, including 
multiple domains in which people often rely on their sense of smell in the 
social context. The importance of the sense of smell and its role can however 
vary inter-individually and culturally. Despite the growing body of literature 
on differences in olfactory performance or hedonic preferences across the globe, 
the aspects of a given culture as well as culturally universal individual 
differences affecting odor awareness in human social life remain unknown. Here, 
we conducted a large-scale analysis of data collected from 10 794 participants 
from 52 study sites from 44 countries all over the world. The aim of our 
research was to explore the potential individual and country-level correlates of 
odor awareness in the social context. The results show that the individual 
characteristics were more strongly related than country-level factors to 
self-reported odor awareness in different social contexts. A model including 
individual-level predictors (gender, age, material situation, education, and 
preferred social distance) provided a relatively good fit to the data, but 
adding country-level predictors (Human Development Index, population density, 
and average temperature) did not improve model parameters. Although there were 
some cross-cultural differences in social odor awareness, the main 
differentiating role was played by the individual differences. This suggests 
that people living in different cultures and different climate conditions may 
still share some similar patterns of odor awareness if they share other 
individual-level characteristics.

A tale of ENSO, PDO, and increasing aridity impacts on drought-deciduous shrubs 
in the Death Valley region.

Germination, establishment, phenology, and death among three drought-deciduous 
shrubs were influenced by ENSO/PDO and precipitation, based on 37 years of 
annual surveys. Encelia farinosa forms near monospecific stands on slopes, 
whereas E. frutescens and Ambrosia salsola dominate wash habitats. All shrubs 
exhibited phenological coherence. While germination, establishment, and 
mortality patterns were similar among wash species, these dynamics contrasted 
with E. farinosa on slopes. Germination was associated with El Niño years. Slope 
plant establishment was dependent on precipitation in the subsequent year, but 
not evidently so in wash species. Major mortality events were episodic, with 
Encelia mortality just as likely to occur in years with below or above average 
precipitation. In both Encelia species, mortality was associated with 
transitions to a cold PDO phase. In E. frutescens this response was more rapid, 
whereas in E. farinosa mortality lagged 1 year, resulting in contrasting 
slope-wash mortality patterns. 50% of newly established shrubs died within 5, 5, 
and 18 years for E. frutescens, E. farinosa, and A. salsola, respectively. The 
90% mortality ages were 26 years for E. frutescens, 24 years for E. farinosa, 
and 51 years for A. salsola. While maximum life expectancies are unknown, 
estimated maximum life expectancies were 56, 66, and 86 years for E. frutescens, 
E. farinosa, and A. salsola, respectively. Overall, as the climate has become 
more arid over the past four decades, the populations in both slope and wash 
habitats have exhibited similar responses: reduced shrub abundances and reduced 
total supportable leaf areas.

OBJECTIVE: Self-management is becoming increasingly important in diabetes but is 
neglected in conventional preference-based measures. The objective of this paper 
was to generate health state utility values for a novel classification system 
measuring the quality-of-life impact of self-management for diabetes, which can 
be used to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
METHODS: A large online survey was conducted using a discrete choice experiment 
(DCE), with duration as an additional attribute, on members of the UK general 
population ( n = 1,493) to elicit values for health (social limitations, mood, 
vitality, hypoglycaemia) and non-health (stress, hassle, control, support) 
aspects of self-management in diabetes. The data were modelled using a 
conditional fixed-effects logit model and utility estimates were anchored on the 
one to zero (full health to dead) scale.
RESULTS: The model produced significant and consistent coefficients, with one 
logical inconsistency and 3 insignificant coefficients for the milder levels of 
some attributes. The anchored utilities ranged from 1 for the best state to 
-0.029 for the worst state (meaning worse than dead) defined by the 
classification system.
CONCLUSION: The results presented here can potentially be used to generate 
utility values capturing the day to day impact of interventions in diabetes on 
both health and self-management. These utility values can potentially be used to 
generate QALYs for economic models of the cost-effectiveness of interventions in 
diabetes.

The growing rate of obesity has recently required governments to divert 
considerable resources in the promotion of healthy lifestyles. We explored the 
relative effectiveness in inducing healthy behaviour change of three different 
communication strategies about the benefits of an intervention that reduces the 
mortality risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and encourages respondents to 
embrace healthier lifestyles. We designed a Discrete Choice Experiments 
questionnaire to analyse the trade-off between lifestyles, defined in terms of 
diet and exercise, and reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk. 
We set three ways of framing an identical benefit: (A) as a reduction in 
mortality risk from cardiovascular disease, (B) as an increase in months of life 
expectancy, and (C) as an increase in the probability of reaching an 
individual's full lifespan. The experiment was tailored for each subject in the 
sample according to his/her individual's baseline information on diet and 
physical activity. During the period February 2010-July 2011, we interviewed 
1008 individuals in Northern Ireland, split randomly into three samples for the 
three CVD risk reduction frames. Considering the models' goodness of fit and 
significance, we conclude that the most effective way of communicating these CVD 
health benefits is using an increase in life expectancy, since with this frame 
individuals are more inclined to state that they would change to a healthier 
lifestyle.

Biological basis and early clinical results of immunotherapy for 
cisplatin-resistant germ cell cancer.

Section of Pneumology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg,

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prognosis of patients with refractory or multiply relapsed 
germ cell cancer (GCC) is dismal with a life expectancy of a few months only. 
Thus, new targets and treatment options are urgently needed. Here, we review and 
discuss the biological basis and first clinical results of immune-checkpoint 
inhibition by targeting programed death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) in 
treatment-refractory GCCs.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is a biological rationale to evaluate immune-checkpoint 
inhibitors in refractory GCCs, as PD-L1 is often expressed and refractory tumors 
often display mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability. However, 
the first published clinical phase II trial evaluating pembrolizumab in 
unselected refractory nonseminoma patients was closed early due to lacking 
clinical activity. On the contrary, single-case reports have shown meaningful 
activity in some patients.
SUMMARY: To date, targeted treatments, including current immunotherapy 
approaches, have only shown very limited activity. Although immune-checkpoint 
inhibition provides an effective treatment option for various malignancies based 
on large randomized clinical trials, data on the use of this immunotherapy in 
refractory GCC are scarce as results of ongoing trials are pending.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy affecting bone marrow 
derived plasma cells. Current therapies are not able to eradicate the disease 
and most patients become refractory to the treatment. Lenalidomide and 
bortezomib have proved effective in the second-line treatment of these patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide in combination 
with dexamethasone compared to bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone in 
patients with multiple myeloma previously treated with bortezomib, from the 
perspective of the Chilean National Health Service.
METHODOLOGY: A four-state Markov model (preprogression on treatment; 
preprogression off treatment, progression and death) was used to simulate the 
evolution of a cohort of multiple myeloma patients over a 25-year time horizon. 
Efficacy data, resource use and frequency of adverse events were extracted from 
MM009/010 studies and a retrospective analysis of retreatment with bortezomib. 
All inputs were validated by experts. A 3% annual discount rate was used for 
costs and health outcomes. The robustness of the results was evaluated through 
univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone treatment provided 1.41 
incremental life years and 0.83 incremental quality-adjusted life years in 
comparison with bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone, with an 
incremental cost of 11 864 597.86 CLP (19 589.86 US$). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratio were estimated at 8 410 266.92 CLP (13 
886,35 US$) / incremental life year and 14 271 896.16 CLP (23 564,59 
US$)/incremental quality-adjusted life years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone represents a 
potentially cost-effective alternative for the second-line treatment of patients 
with multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplantation, from the 
perspective of the Chilean National Health Service.

Publisher: CONTEXTO: El mieloma múltiple es una neoplasia de las células 
plasmáticas de la medula ósea. Las terapias disponibles no son curativas y la 
mayoría de los pacientes se vuelve refractario al tratamiento. Agentes como 
lenalidomida y bortezomib han demostrado su eficacia en el tratamien-to en 
segunda línea de estos pacientes.
OBJETIVO: Evaluar el costo-efectividad de la combinación 
lenalidomida/dexametasona frente a bortezomib/dexametasona en pacientes con 
mieloma múltiple, no candidatos a trasplante, previamente tratados con 
bortezomib, desde la perspectiva del sistema nacional de salud chileno.
METODOLOGÍA: Se empleó un modelo de Markov que simula la evolución de una 
cohorte de pacientes a través de cuatro estados de salud (preprogresión en 
tratamiento, preprogresión sin tratamiento, progresión o muerte) en un horizonte 
temporal de 25 años. Los datos de eficacia, uso de recursos y frecuencia de 
efectos adversos fueron extraídos de los ensayos sobre mieloma múltiple MM-009 y 
MM-010 y de un estudio retrospectivo de retratamiento con bortezomib. Todos los 
parámetros fueron validados por expertos. Se aplicó una tasa de descuento en 
costos y beneficios de 3%. La robustez de los resultados fue evaluada mediante 
un análisis de sensibilidad univariante y probabilístico.
RESULTADOS: El tratamiento con lenalidomida/dexametasona proporciona 1,41 años 
de vida y 0,83 años de vida ajustados por calidad incrementales respecto a 
bortezomib/dexametasona, con un costo incremental de 11 864 597,86 pesos 
chilenos (19 589,86 dólares). La ratio de cos-to-efectividad y costo-utilidad 
incremental se cifró en 8 410 266,92 pesos chilenos (13 886,35 dólares) por año 
de vida ganado y 14 271 896,16 pesos chilenos (23 564,59 dólares) por año de 
vida ajustado por calidad respectivamente.
CONCLUSIÓN: La lenalidomida/dexametasona representa una alternativa 
potencialmente costo-efectiva, desde la perspectiva del sistema nacional de 
salud chileno, para el tratamiento en segunda línea de pacientes con mieloma 
múltiple no candidatos a trasplante.

Precision public health approaches are crucial for targeting health policies to 
regions most affected by disease. We present the first sub-national and 
spatially explicit burden of disease study in Africa. We used a cross-sectional 
study design and assessed data from the Kenya population and housing census of 
2009 for calculating YLLs (years of life lost) due to premature mortality at the 
division level (N = 612). We conducted spatial autocorrelation analysis to 
identify spatial clusters of YLLs and applied boosted regression trees to find 
statistical associations between locational risk factors and YLLs. We found 
statistically significant spatial clusters of high numbers of YLLs at the 
division level in western, northwestern, and northeastern areas of Kenya. 
Ethnicity and household crowding were the most important and significant risk 
factors for YLL. Further positive and significantly associated variables were 
malaria endemicity, northern geographic location, and higher YLL in neighboring
