in studies conducted after 2011. Females are an underrepresented group in 
studies assessing the cardiovascular outcomes related to high-dose exercise. As 
cardiovascular outcomes vary between sexes, translating findings from a largely 
male-based evidence may not be appropriate. Future investigators should aim to 
establish and overcome barriers to female recruitment.

Achondroplasia is the commonest hereditary skeletal dysplasia exhibiting 
dwarfism with characteristic rhizomelic (proximal) shortening of the limbs. It 
is predominantly linked with an autosomal dominant inheritance, but sporadic 
mutations can occur which are associated with advanced maternal age. 
Approximately 1 in every 25 000-30 000 live births are affected, and the overall 
life expectancy is marginally reduced by ~10 years. Mutations in the fibroblast 
growth factor receptor causes a decrease in endochondral ossification, which 
results in stunted growth of cartilaginous bones. A resultant narrowed foramen 
magnum and a short clivus are seen which predisposes to craniocervical spinal 
canal stenosis. Apnoeic events arising from the compression of the vertebral 
arteries at the level of the craniocervical junction lead to fatality in the 
young, with a death rate as high as 7.5%. Decrease in the caudal inter-pedicular 
distance is characteristic and a contributory factor for cervical, thoracic and 
lumbar spinal canal stenosis, most pronounced in the lumbar spine with patients 
often requiring surgical intervention to ease symptoms. Thoracolumbar 
kyphoscoliosis and sacral manifestations such as small sacro-sciatic notches and 
a horizontal pelvis are seen. The aim of this pictorial review is to demonstrate 
the imaging findings of the spinal and pelvic manifestations of achondroplasia.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 deaths are commoner among care-home residents, but the 
mortality burden has not been quantified.
METHODS: Care-home residency was identified via a national primary care 
registration database linked to mortality data. Life expectancy was estimated 
using Makeham-Gompertz models to (i) describe yearly life expectancy from 
November 2015 to October 2020 (ii) compare life expectancy (during 2016-18) 
between care-home residents and the wider population and (iii) apply care-home 
life expectancy estimates to COVID-19 death counts to estimate years of life 
lost (YLL).
RESULTS: Among care-home residents, life expectancy in 2015/16 to 2019/20 ranged 
from 2.7 to 2.3 years for women and 2.3 to 1.8 years for men. Age-sex-specific 
life expectancy in 2016-18 in care-home residents was lower than in the Scottish 
population (10 and 2.5 years in those aged 70 and 90, respectively). Applying 
care home-specific life expectancies to COVID-19 deaths yield mean YLLs for 
care-home residents of 2.6 and 2.2 for women and men, respectively. In total YLL 
care-home residents have lost 3,560 years in women and 2,046 years in men. 
Approximately half of deaths and a quarter of YLL attributed to COVID-19 were 
accounted for by the 5% of over-70s who were care-home residents.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection has led to the loss of substantial years of life 
in care-home residents aged 70 years and over in Scotland. Prioritising the 5% 
of older adults who are care-home residents for vaccination is justified not 
only in terms of total deaths, but also in terms of YLL.

BACKGROUND: Addictions share common etiological factors associated with 
personality vulnerabilities such as narcissism or emotional instability. Also, 
there are gender differences in the type of and risk for addiction (e.g., men 
may be more prone to addictions, overall). These are considerably less 
understood in relation to behavioral addictions (BAs) than in substance use 
disorders. This study aimed to investigate associations between profiles of six 
potential BAs (study, shopping, gaming, Facebook, pornography, and food) and 
gender, personality, and well-being among Polish emerging adults, as a partial 
replication and extension of previous work.
PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: In a paper-and-pencil cross-sectional study, 1182 
Polish undergraduate students (mean age = 20.33 years; SD = 1.68) completed 
questionnaires measuring six potential BAs alongside questions on demographic 
variables, personality traits (Big Five, narcissism), and well-being indicators 
(general quality of life, health quality, sleep quality, perceived stress, 
anxiety, and hopelessness).
RESULTS: Using latent profile analysis, four profiles were identified: (1) 
elevated levels of study, Facebook, shopping, and food addictions; (2) elevated 
levels of gaming and pornography addictions; (3) low or average levels of all 
potential BAs, and (4) highest levels of all potential BAs. The second and 
fourth profiles included men predominantly, and the first profile included 
almost exclusively women. The fourth profile, in comparison to all other 
profiles, demonstrated significantly higher scores on all potential BAs, 
narcissism, lowest conscientiousness and emotional stability, and lowest 
well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that there is a general proclivity to potential 
BAs. Furthermore, there are gender-specific profiles of potential BAs, which at 
present are poorly understood.

In the last 30-40 years, developed countries in particular, but also developing 
ones, have seen an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in infant 
mortality and morbidity rates. These factors are due to an increase in living 
standards, a decrease in differences between social classes, the increased 
accessibility of education to women, and the implementation of some public 
health measures. When certain basic social and medical measures are implemented 
on a large scale, their benefits are first reflected in lower infant mortality 
rates, and only in the second stage are such benefits reflected in decreasing 
neonatal mortality rates and a smaller number of stillbirths. In this study, we 
review the literature on these factors. We extrapolate and compare this 
literature with data recorded in our country in the hopes of finding the reasons 
why Romania ranks first in the European Union in terms of infant mortality 
rates. We found that lowering the infant morbidity, mortality, and congenital 
malformation rates is an absolute priority in Romania, which requires the 
involvement of decision makers in taking effective measures regarding food 
supplementation or enhancement using folic acid, adequate counselling of 
couples, monitoring of all pregnancies, setting antenatal diagnosis, 
implementing optimal delivery management and therapeutic approaches to 
problematic pregnancies in other hospitals and by involving the population in 
health education, avoiding occupational or in-home exposure to toxic factors, 
avoiding drug use, and implementing disease and infection prevention measures 
for pregnant women.

Edible and active packaging are attractive for use in food packaging 
applications due to their functionality and sustainability. This research 
developed new antioxidant active food packaging materials from cassava 
starch/gelatin (7:3 w/w) composite films with varied antioxidant types 
(quercetin and tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)) and concentrations (0-200 
mg/200 mL film-forming solution) and evaluated their properties. Antioxidant 
addition altered the mechanical and barrier properties of the films. At 34% 
relative humidity (RH), increasing the concentration of quercetin increased the 
tensile strength and decreased the elongation at break of the composite films. 
Increasing quercetin and TBHQ contents increased the film water solubility and 
water vapor transmission rate. Intermolecular interactions between the 
antioxidants and films, as found in Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra 
and XRD micrographs, were related to the changed film functionalities. In food 
application studies, the cassava starch/gelatin films containing quercetin and 
TBHQ retarded the oxidation of lard (more than 35 days) and delayed the redness 
discoloration of pork. Cassava starch/gelatin composite films integrated with 
quercetin and TBHQ can be utilized as active packaging that delays oxidation in 
foods.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acute Ramadan fasting 
(RF) on the muscle function and buffering system. Twelve male athletes with 8 
years of professional sports experience (age, 23.2 ± 1.3 years, body mass index: 
24.2 ± 2.2 kg/m2) participated in this study. The subjects were tested twice, 3 
weeks after the beginning of RF and 2 weeks after the end RF. Muscle function, 
buffering capacity, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during 
and after RF by using the Biodex isokinetic machine, blood gas analyzer, and RPE 
6-20 Borg scale, respectively. Venous blood samples for pH and bicarbonate 
(HCO3-) were measured during and after RF by using the Biodex isokinetic 
machine, blood gas analyzer, and RPE 6-20 Borg scale, respectively. Venous blood 
samples for pH and bicarbonate (HCO3-) were taken immediately after 25 
repetitions of isokinetic knee flexion and extension. Measures taken during 
isokinetic knee extension during RF were significantly lower than those after RF 
in extension peak torque (t = -4.72, p = 0.002), flexion peak torque (t = -3.80, 
p = 0.007), extension total work (t = -3.05, p = 0.019), extension average power 
(t = -4.20, p = 0.004), flexion average power (t = -3.37, p = 0.012), blood 
HCO3- (t = -2.02, p = 0.041), and RPE (Z = -1.69, p = 0.048). No influence of RF 
was found on the blood pH (t = 0.752, p = 0.476). RF has adverse effects on 
muscle function and buffering capacity in athletes. It seems that a 
low-carbohydrate substrate during RF impairs muscle performance and reduces the 
buffering capacity of the blood, leading to fatigue in athletes.

The treatment and management of patients with metastatic melanoma have evolved 
considerably in the "era" of personalized medicine. Melanoma was one of the 
first solid tumors to benefit from immunotherapy; life expectancy for patients 
in advanced stage of disease has improved. However, many progresses have yet to 
be made considering the (still) high number of patients who do not respond to 
therapies or who suffer adverse events. In this scenario, precision medicine 
appears fundamental to direct the most appropriate treatment to the single 
patient and to guide towards treatment decisions. The recent multi-omics 
analyses (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, radiomics, etc.) 
and the technological evolution of data interpretation have allowed to identify 
and understand several processes underlying the biology of cancer; therefore, 
improving the tumor clinical management. Specifically, these approaches have 
identified new pharmacological targets and potential biomarkers used to predict 
the response or adverse events to treatments. In this review, we will analyze 
and describe the most important omics approaches, by evaluating the 
methodological aspects and progress in melanoma precision medicine.

As human life expectancy is rising, the incidence of age-associated diseases 
will also increase. Scientific evidence has revealed that healthy diets, 
including good fats, vitamins, minerals, or polyphenolics, could have 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, with antiaging effects. Recent 
studies demonstrated that vitamin K is a vital cofactor in activating several 
proteins, which act against age-related syndromes. Thus, vitamin K can 
carboxylate osteocalcin (a protein capable of transporting and fixing calcium in 
bone), activate matrix Gla protein (an inhibitor of vascular calcification and 
cardiovascular events) and carboxylate Gas6 protein (involved in brain 
physiology and a cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease inhibitor). By 
improving insulin sensitivity, vitamin K lowers diabetes risk. It also exerts 
antiproliferative, proapoptotic, autophagic effects and has been associated with 
a reduced risk of cancer. Recent research shows that protein S, another vitamin 
K-dependent protein, can prevent the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 cases. 
The reduced activation of protein S due to the pneumonia-induced vitamin K 
depletion was correlated with higher thrombogenicity and possibly fatal outcomes 
in COVID-19 patients. Our review aimed to present the latest scientific evidence 
about vitamin K and its role in preventing age-associated diseases and/or 
improving the effectiveness of medical treatments in mature adults ˃50 years 
old.

The Cdkn2a locus is one of the most studied tumor suppressor loci in the context 
of several cancer types. However, in the last years, its expression has also 
been linked to terminal differentiation and the activation of the senescence 
program in different cellular subtypes. Knock-out (KO) of the entire locus 
enhances the capability of stem cells to proliferate in some tissues and respond 
to severe physiological and non-physiological damages in different organs, 
including the heart. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized 
by severe contractures and muscle loss at the level of skeletal muscles of the 
elbows, ankles and neck, and by dilated cardiomyopathy. We have recently 
demonstrated, using the LMNA Δ8-11 murine model of Emery-Dreifuss muscular 
dystrophy (EDMD), that dystrophic muscle stem cells prematurely express 
non-lineage-specific genes early on during postnatal growth, leading to rapid 
exhaustion of the muscle stem cell pool. Knock-out of the Cdkn2a locus in EDMD 
dystrophic mice partially restores muscle stem cell properties. In the present 
study, we describe the cardiac phenotype of the LMNA Δ8-11 mouse model and 
functionally characterize the effects of KO of the Cdkn2a locus on heart 
functions and life expectancy.

Heart transplantation became a reality at the end of the 1960s as a life-saving 
option for patients with end-stage heart failure. Static cold storage (SCS) at 
4-6 °C has remained the standard for heart preservation for decades. However, 
SCS only allows for short-term storage that precludes optimal matching programs, 
requires emergency surgeries, and results in the unnecessary discard of organs. 
Among the alternatives seeking to extend ex vivo lifespan and mitigate the 
shortage of organs are sub-zero or machine perfusion modalities. Sub-zero 
approaches aim to prolong cold ischemia tolerance by deepening metabolic stasis, 
while machine perfusion aims to support metabolism through the continuous 
delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Each of these approaches hold promise; 
however, complex barriers must be overcome before their potential can be fully 
realized. We suggest that one barrier facing all experimental efforts to extend 
ex vivo lifespan are limited research tools. Mammalian models are usually the 
first choice due to translational aspects, yet experimentation can be restricted 
by expertise, time, and resources. Instead, there are instances when smaller 
vertebrate models, like the zebrafish, could fill critical experimental gaps in 
the field. Taken together, this review provides a summary of the current gold 
standard for heart preservation as well as new technologies in ex vivo lifespan 
extension. Furthermore, we describe how existing tools in zebrafish research, 
including isolated organ, cell specific and functional assays, as well as 
molecular tools, could complement and elevate heart preservation research.

We estimate the weekly excess all-cause mortality in Norway and Sweden, the 
years of life lost (YLL) attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden, and the significance 
of mortality displacement. We computed the expected mortality by taking into 
account the declining trend and the seasonality in mortality in the two 
countries over the past 20 years. From the excess mortality in Sweden in 
2019/20, we estimated the YLL attributed to COVID-19 using the life expectancy 
in different age groups. We adjusted this estimate for possible displacement 
using an auto-regressive model for the year-to-year variations in excess 
mortality. We found that excess all-cause mortality over the epidemic year, July 
2019 to July 2020, was 517 (95%CI = (12, 1074)) in Norway and 4329 [3331, 5325] 
in Sweden. There were 255 COVID-19 related deaths reported in Norway, and 5741 
in Sweden, that year. During the epidemic period of 11 March-11 November, there 
were 6247 reported COVID-19 deaths and 5517 (4701, 6330) excess deaths in 
Sweden. We estimated that the number of YLL attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden was 
45,850 [13,915, 80,276] without adjusting for mortality displacement and 43,073 
(12,160, 85,451) after adjusting for the displacement accounted for by the 
auto-regressive model. In conclusion, we find good agreement between officially 
recorded COVID-19 related deaths and all-cause excess deaths in both countries 
during the first epidemic wave and no significant mortality displacement that 
can explain those deaths.

The impact of the de-escalation strategy of antiplatelet therapy (APT) on the 
life expectancy after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) requires an assessment in real clinical practice. Into the 
Russian multicentral observational trial (ORACLE II ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT04068909), 1803 patients with ACS and PCI indications were enrolled. During 
12 months of follow-up, 228 all-cause deaths have occurred. The analysis of 
death predictors was carried out by the classification tree method. Age, an 
option of antithrombotic therapy, a history of chronic heart failure, and uric 
acid level had the greatest prognostic value. The death prediction model's 
sensitivity was 82.1% in the training cohort and 79.2% in the test cohort. 
During the observation period, ticagrelor was replaced with clopidogrel (APT 
de-escalation) in 357 patients. The groups of patients with different 
antiplatelet therapy options were adjusted for clinical parameters by the 
pseudorandomization method. The de-escalation group had the lowerest all-cause 
death rate. The incidence of bleeding and recurrent nonfatal coronary events in 
the study groups did not differ significantly. Thus, the APT regimen's advantage 
of changing from the maximum in the first weeks after ACS to moderate at 
follow-up has been confirmed. There is an obvious need to study the 
possibilities of individualizing antiplatelet therapy in patients after acute 
coronary syndromes.

BACKGROUND: The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and potassium 
supplementation have been shown to reduce the risk of death with a functioning 
graft (DWFG) and renal graft failure in renal transplant recipients (RTR). 
Unfortunately, a key problem for patients is the adherence to these diets. The 
aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of 
higher adherence to either the DASH or potassium supplementation.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the life course of 1000 RTR in the 
Netherlands. A societal perspective with a lifetime time horizon was used. The 
potential effect of improvement of dietary adherence was modelled in different 
scenarios. The primary outcomes are the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) and the budget impact.
RESULTS: In the base case, improved adherence to the DASH diet saved 27,934,786 
and gained 1880 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Improved adherence to 
potassium supplementation saved €1,217,803 and gained 2901 QALYs. Both resulted 
in dominant ICERs. The budget impact over a five-year period for the entire 
Dutch RTR population was €8,144,693.
CONCLUSION: Improving dietary adherence in RTR is likely to be cost-saving and 
highly likely to be cost-effective compared to the current standard of care in 
the Netherlands.

Electroencephalography neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) training can induce changes in 
the power of targeted EEG bands. The objective of this study is to enhance and 
evaluate the specific changes of EEG power spectral density that the 
brain-machine interface (BMI) users can reliably generate for power augmentation 
through EEG-NFB training. First, we constructed an EEG-NFB training system for 
power augmentation. Then, three subjects were assigned to three NFB training 
stages, based on a 6-day consecutive training session as one stage. The subjects 
received real-time feedback from their EEG signals by a robotic arm while 
conducting flexion and extension movement with their elbow and shoulder joints, 
respectively. EEG signals were compared with each NFB training stage. The 
training results showed that EEG beta (12-40 Hz) power increased after the NFB 
training for both the elbow and the shoulder joints' movements. EEG beta power 
showed sustained improvements during the 3-stage training, which revealed that 
even the short-term training could improve EEG signals significantly. Moreover, 
the training effect of the shoulder joints was more obvious than that of the 
elbow joints. These results suggest that NFB training can improve EEG signals 
and clarify the specific EEG changes during the movement. Our results may even 
provide insights into how the neural effects of NFB can be better applied to the 
BMI power augmentation system and improve the performance of healthy 
individuals.

Ferritin, one of the most investigated protein nanocages, is considered as a 
promising drug carrier because of its advantageous stability and safety. 
However, its short half-life and undesirable tumor targeting ability has limited 
its usage in tumor treatment. In this work, two types of functional peptides, 
half-life extension peptide PAS, and tumor targeting peptide RGDK 
(Arg-Gly-Asp-Lys), are inserted to human heavy-chain ferritin (HFn) at 
C-terminal through flexible linkers with two distinct enzyme cleavable sites. 
Structural characterizations show both HFn and engineered HFns can assemble into 
nanoparticles but with different apparent hydrodynamic volumes and molecular 
weights. RGDK peptide enhanced the internalization efficiency of HFn and showed 
a significant increase of growth inhibition against 4T1 cell line in vitro. 
Pharmacokinetic study in vivo demonstrates PAS peptides extended ferritin 
half-life about 4.9 times in Sprague Dawley rats. RGDK peptides greatly enhanced 
drug accumulation in the tumor site rather than in other organs in 
biodistribution analysis. Drug loaded PAS-RGDK functionalized HFns curbed tumor 
growth with significantly greater efficacies in comparison with drug loaded HFn.

As the population ages, the number of older populations globally requiring 
palliative care is rapidly growing, requiring services of multidisciplinary 
teams-including community pharmacists. The aim of this study is to describe the 
community pharmacists' perceived role in providing services to community 
dwelling older Australians receiving palliative care. Utilising an eight-domain 
End of Life Directions for Aged Care (ELDAC) care model, a national 
cross-sectional questionnaire was designed and undertaken online with Australian 
community pharmacists. Respondents were asked questions relating to 
socio-demographic characteristics, practice characteristics, and scope of 
services provided. Of the 62 pharmacists who responded to the questionnaire, 51 
were included in the final data analysis and reporting. Pharmacists working in 
dispensing roles made up about half of the respondents, while the remainder 
worked in settings such as general practice, residential aged care, or providing 
medication review services. Pharmacists can identify patients with indicators of 
poor life expectancy and mostly work with older Australians daily. Dispensing 
and non-dispensing pharmacists offer a range of services that complement each 
other. Organisations caring for the aged should consider the role of the 
pharmacist, in caring for people with palliative care needs, along with their 
carers.

The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a 
polyphagous insect pest is a major threat to a wide range of crops worldwide. 
Aiming to evaluate the life history traits of M. persicae, feeding on different 
host plants, we used five vegetables: cabbage, Brassica oleracea (Brassicaceae); 
chinese cabbage, B. rapa (Brassicaceae); chili pepper, Capsicum annum 
(Solanaceae); crown daisy, Chrysanthemum coronarium (Asteraceae); and eggplant, 
Solanum melongena (Solanaceae). TWOSEX-MSchart software was used for the 
statistical analysis about the age-stage, two-sex life table theory. The highest 
fecundity (69.65 individuals) rate of M. persicae, intrinsic rate of increase (r 
= 0.425 d-1), finite rate of increase (λ = 1.531 d-1), net reproductive rate (R0 
= 69.65 offspring), and shortest mean generation time (T = 9.964 d) were 
recorded on the chili pepper plant. Whereas, lower fitness occurred on cabbage. 
The findings attained from population growth parameters indicate that chili 
pepper is the most susceptible plant, while cabbage is resistant to aphids. 
Population projection results also supported this statement, as the final total 
population size on cabbage was significantly lower than other plants. The 
reported information would be useful for devising integrated pest management 
programs, particularly those involving M. persicae. This information also 
suggests the adaptability of M. persicae causing economic damage to these 
vegetable cultivars.

Economic assessment is of utmost importance in the healthcare decision-making 
process. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) concept provides a rare 
opportunity to combine two crucial aspects of health, i.e., mortality and 
morbidity, into a single index to perform cost-utility comparison. Today, many 
tools are available to measure morbidity in terms of health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) and a large literature describes how to use them. Knowing their 
characteristics and development process is a key point for elaborating, 
adapting, or selecting the most well-suited instrument for further needs. In 
this aim, we conducted a systematic review on instruments used for QALY 
calculation, and 46 studies were selected after searches in four databases: 
Medline EBSCO, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. The search procedure was done 
to identify all relevant publications up to 18 June 2020. We mainly focused on 
the type of instrument developed (i.e., generic or specific), the number and the 
nature of dimensions and levels used, the elicitation method and the model 
selected to determine utility scores, and the instrument and algorithm 
validation methods. Results show that studies dealing with the development of 
specific instruments were mostly motivated by the inappropriateness of generic 
instruments in their field. For the dimensions' and levels' selection, item 
response theory, Rasch analysis, and literature review were mostly used. 
Dimensions and levels were validated by methods like the Loevinger H, the 
standardised response mean, or discussions with experts in the field. The time 
trade-off method was the most widely used elicitation method, followed by the 
visual analogue scale. Random effects regression models were frequently used in 
determining utility scores.

The wrist is among the predilection sites of over 90% of cases of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). In advanced cases, total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) is an 
alternative to arthrodesis. The aim of this study is to present the long-term 
results of the modular physiological wrist prosthesis (MPW®) and to match them 
in context with the results of a standard population survey. In a retrospective 
study with follow-up, patients with an MPW® endoprosthesis were evaluated 
concerning the clinical and radiological outcome, complications were reviewed 
(incidence and type), and conversion to wrist fusion was assessed. Patient 
function measurements included the Mayo wrist score, the patient-specific wrist 
test, and therefore the DASH score (arm, shoulder, and hand). Thirty-four MPW® 
wrist prostheses were implanted in 32 patients, including thirty primary 
implantations and four changes of the type of the endoprosthesis. Sixteen 
patients (18 prostheses) underwent clinical and radiological follow-up. The 
average follow-up time was 8.5 years (1 to 16). Poor results of the MPW 
prosthesis are caused by the issues of balancing with luxation and increased PE 
wear. Salvage procedures included revision of the TWA or fusion. In successful 
cases, the flexion and extension movement averaged 40 degrees. The grip force 
was around 2.5 kg. The common DASH score was 79 points, with limited and 
problematic joints of the upper extremity. The MPW wrist prosthesis offered good 
pain relief and functional movement in over 80% of cases. The issues of 
dislocation and increased PE wear prevent better long-term results, as do the 
joints affected. A follow-up study with fittings under a contemporary 
anti-rheumatic therapy with biologicals suggests increasing score results. Type 
of study/level of evidence: Case series, IV.

As life expectancy has increased, particularly in developed countries, due to 
medical advances and increased prosperity, age-related neurological diseases and 
mental health disorders have become more prevalent health issues, reducing the 
well-being and quality of life of sufferers and their families. In recent 
decades, due to reduced work-related levels of physical activity, and key 
research insights, prescribing adequate exercise has become an innovative 
strategy to prevent or delay the onset of these pathologies and has been 
demonstrated to have therapeutic benefits when used as a sole or combination 
treatment. Recent evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of exercise on 
the brain are related to several underlying mechanisms related to muscle-brain, 
liver-brain and gut-brain crosstalk. Therefore, this review aims to summarize 
the most relevant current knowledge of the impact of exercise on mood disorders 
and neurodegenerative diseases, and to highlight the established and potential 
underlying mechanisms involved in exercise-brain communication and their 
benefits for physiology and brain function.

Background: Estimation of life expectancy in older patients is relevant to 
select the best treatment strategy. We aimed to develop and validate a score to 
predict early mortality in older patients with cancer. Patients and Methods: A 
total of 749 patients over 70 years starting new chemotherapy regimens were
