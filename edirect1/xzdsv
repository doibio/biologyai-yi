This study aimed to analyze whether the relationship between regional and 
whole-body fat-free mass (FFM) and strength is related to FFM distribution and 
area according to limb involvement. Thirty well-trained male young adults 
underwent one-repetition maximum test (1RM) to assess the strength in arm curl 
(AC), bench press (BP), seated row (SR), leg press 45° (LP45), knee extension 
(KE), and leg curl (LC). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to evaluate 
FFM. The values for 1RM in AC, BP, and R correlated to FFM in upper limb (R2 = 
0.69, 0.84 and 0.75), without an effect of appendicular mass index (API) or 
area. For 1RM in KE, the correlation with FFM in lower limb increased with thigh 
area (R2 = 0.56), whereas 1RM in LC and LP45 correlation to whole-body FFM 
increased with API (R2 = 0.64 and 0.49). The upper limb's FFM may be reliable 
for indexing the arms and upper trunk strengths, whereas the relationships 
between FFM and strength in lower limb improve as muscle mass and thigh area 
increases between subjects.

Long-Term Care Insurance Pilot Programme in China: Policy Evaluation and 
Optimization Options-Taking the Pilot Programme in the Northeast of China as an 
Example.

China's population is ageing rapidly and the increase in life expectancy is 
accompanied by a loss of capability with advancing age, especially in the 
Northeast. This study adopts qualitative research methods to analyze the overall 
status and problems of China's LTCI policy pilots. Taking four LTCI pilot cities 
in three northeastern provinces as samples, we used purposive sampling to 
recruit 10 beneficiaries and providers of LTCI in nursing homes of different 
kinds, as well as 2 operators (Medical Insurance Bureau staff) for 
semi-structured in-depth interviews. We developed a social welfare policy 
analysis framework based on Gilbert's framework, designed interview outlines and 
conducted a thematic analysis of the interview data along five dimensions: 
allocation base, type of provision, delivery strategy, finance mode, and 
external environment. The results of the research indicate that the coverage of 
the system is narrow and that disability assessment criteria are fragmented; 
that the substance of service provision is lacking, both in terms of precision 
and dynamic adjustment mechanisms; that socialized care synergy cannot be 
achieved, informal care lacking policy support; that there is an over-reliance 
on medical insurance funds and that unfair financing standards are applied; and 
that economic and social development is insufficient to cope with ageing needs 
and uncertain risks. Accordingly, this research proposes several optimization 
options to promote the full establishment of LTCI.

BACKGROUND: Global distributions and trends of the risk-attributable burdens of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have rarely been systematically 
explored. To guide the formulation of targeted and accurate strategies for the 
management of COPD, we analyzed COPD burdens attributable to known risk factors.
METHODS: Using detailed COPD data from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019, 
we analyzed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with disability 
(YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and deaths attributable to each risk factor 
from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, we calculated estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPCs) during the study period. The population attributable fraction 
(PAF) and summary exposure value (SEV) of each risk factor are also presented.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized DALY and death rates of COPD 
attributable to smoking and household air pollution, occupational particles, 
secondhand smoke, and low temperature presented consistently declining trends in 
almost all socio-demographic index (SDI) regions. However, the decline in YLD 
was not as dramatic as that of the death rate. In contrast, the COPD burden 
attributable to ambient particulate matter, ozone, and high temperature exposure 
showed undesirable increasing trends in the low- and low-middle-SDI regions. In 
addition, the age-standardized DALY and death rates attributable to each risk 
factor except household air pollution and low temperature were the highest in 
the low-middle-SDI region. In 2019, the COPD burden attributable to smoking 
ambient particulate matter, ozone, occupational particles, low and high 
temperature was obviously greater in males than in females. Meanwhile, the most 
important risk factors for female varied across regions (low- and low-middle-SDI 
regions: household air pollution; middle-SDI region: ambient particles; 
high-middle- and high-SDI region: smoking).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing trends of COPD burden attributable to ambient 
particulate matter, ozone, and high temperature exposure in the low-middle- and 
low-SDI regions call for an urgent need to implement specific and effective 
measures. Moreover, considering the gender differences in COPD burdens 
attributable to some risk factors such as ambient particulate matter and ozone 
with similar SEV, further research on biological differences between sexes in 
COPD and relevant policy-making of disease prevention are required.

Cardiovascular diseases are the main causes of death and health costs in 
developed countries. Although cardiovascular diseases are thought to affect only 
adulthood, the underlying process of atherosclerosis begins in the first decade 
of life. Epidemiological studies show that severity of atherosclerosis depends 
both on the number and intensity of risk factors. Early detection of 
cardiovascular risk in childhood is the most powerful tool to prevent 
cardiovascular accidents in adulthood and possibly reduce its consequent burden 
for the future.A large amount of cardiovascular risk factors is already 
detectable in childhood and include non-modifiable elements, among which genetic 
factors and congenital heart diseases, and modifiable elements, which depend on 
environmental effects (e.g. lifestyle and nutrition). Regardless of the 
possibility to intervene on these factors, an early diagnosis is fundamental to 
ensure an optimal life expectancy in adulthood. The most important 
cardiovascular risk factors in the paediatric age and adolescence are excess 
weight, arterial hypertension, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism 
alterations.In this review we will discuss the main risk factors strictly 
correlated with cardiac and vessels diseases, focusing on their pathogenesis, 
diagnosis, and treatments.

BACKGROUND: Late-life depression is common, modifiable, yet under-treated. 
Service silos and human resources shortage contribute to insufficient prevention 
and intervention. We describe an implementation research protocol of 
collaborative stepped care and peer support model that integrates community 
mental health and aged care services to address service fragmentation, using 
productive ageing and recovery principles to involve older people as peer 
supporters to address human resource issue.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a non-randomised controlled trial examining the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the "Jockey Club Holistic Support 
Project for Elderly Mental Wellness" (JC JoyAge) model versus care as usual 
(CAU) in community aged care and community mental health service units in 
12 months. Older people aged 60 years and over with mild to moderate depressive 
symptoms or risk factors for developing depression will be included. JoyAge 
service users will receive group-based activities and psychoeducation, 
low-intensity psychotherapy, or high-intensity psychotherapy according to the 
stepped care protocol in addition to usual community mental health or aged care, 
with support from an older peer supporter. The primary clinical outcome, 
depressive symptoms, and secondary outcomes, self-harm risk, anxiety symptoms, 
and loneliness, will be measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9), Self-Harm Inventory, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), 
and UCLA Loneliness 3-item scale (UCLA-3) respectively. Cost-effectiveness 
analysis will assess health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D-5L and 
service utilisation using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI). We use 
multilevel linear mixed models to compare outcomes change between groups and 
calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of quality-adjusted 
life years.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence about outcomes for older persons 
with mental health needs receiving collaborative stepped care service without 
silos and with trained young-old volunteers to support engagement, treatment, 
and transitions. Cost-effectiveness findings from this study will inform 
resource allocation in this under-treated population.

The friend within? The implantable cardioverter defibrillator between saving 
lives and chronically impairing them.

Barlocco F(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, 
Firenze, Italy.

This article considers the way in which a medical technology, the implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), by preventing fatal outcomes, in this case 
sudden death, deriving from cardiac diseases, and specifically hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, contributes to the development of a particular type of 
chronicity. While biomedicine celebrates technological advances in treatments 
and naturalises chronicity, focussing on life expectancy as a victory over the 
'acute' aspects of the disease, the way in which patients live with the disease 
is left unquestioned. The article follows Smith-Morris's (2010) perspective in 
seeing chronicity as the never-ending process of identifying with one's disease, 
adding a focus on the role played by an embodied technology in relation to it. 
Based on participant observation in a clinical setting and interviews with 
clinicians, the article interrogates three key themes in the chronicity of 
cardiac patients implanted with an ICD: risk, quality of life and choice. The 
data shows a constant tension between managing a one-off potentially fatal 
'acute' risk and life with serious disruptions due to the limitations imposed by 
the implanted device. The article argues that patients' resources for facing the 
life and identity disrupted by the disease are limited by ideas of what living a 
diseased body is, which acritically follow discourses of 'patient choice' and a 
'technological imperative' to avoid risk.

INTRODUCTION: Cost-effectiveness evaluations of psychological interventions, 
such as internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) programmes, in 
patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are rare. We recently reported 
moderate to large effect sizes on depressive symptoms in CVD outpatients 
following a 9-week iCBT programme compared with an online discussion forum 
(ODF), in favour of iCBT. In this paper, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
this intervention.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial. The 
EQ-5D-3L was used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Data on 
healthcare costs were retrieved from healthcare registries.
RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, the QALY was significantly higher in iCBT 
compared with the ODF group (0.713 vs 0.598, p=0.007). The mean difference of 
0.115 corresponds with 42 extra days in best imaginable health status in favour 
of the iCBT group over the course of 1 year. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) for iCBT versus ODF was €18 865 per QALY saved. The 
cost-effectiveness plane indicated that iCBT is a cheaper and more effective 
intervention in 24.5% of the cases, and in 75% a costlier and more effective 
intervention than ODF. Only in about 0.5% of the cases, there was an indication 
of a costlier, but less effective intervention compared with ODF.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICER of €18 865 was lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold 
range of €23 400-€35 100 as proposed by the NICE guidelines, suggesting that the 
iCBT treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with CVD is cost-effective.

Ketorolac tromethamine alleviates IL-1β-induced chondrocyte injury by inhibiting 
COX-2 expression.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequently diagnosed chronic diseases, 
and its prevalence is rising as life expectancy increases. The present study was 
designed to investigate the role of ketorolac tromethamine (KT) in OA by 
establishing an in vitro model in ATDC5 cells. The OA model was established 
through induction using 10 ng/ml IL-1β. KT was then used to treat the ATDC5 
cells. An MTT assay was adopted to detect the viability of ATDC5 cells with or 
without IL-1β induction, and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in 
IL-1β-induced ATDC5 cells was measured via reverse transcription-quantitative 
(RT-q)PCR and western blotting. To explore the effects of KT on proliferation 
and apoptosis in IL-1β-induced ATDC5 cells, COX-2 was overexpressed and RT-qPCR 
was employed to detect the mRNA expression of COX-2. The viability of 
IL-1β-induced ATDC5 cells was detected by using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. In 
addition, levels of apoptosis and apoptosis-related proteins were determined 
using TUNEL staining and western blotting, respectively. Additionally, the 
effects of KT on oxidative stress in IL-1β-induced ATDC5 cells were also 
investigated. The expression levels of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible NO 
synthase (iNOS) were detected via NO kit assay and western blotting, 
respectively. In addition, the expression levels of oxidative stress-related 
proteins, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), were determined using ELISA. To investigate the 
effects of KT on the inflammatory response and extracellular matrix (ECM) 
degradation, ELISA and western blotting were adopted to detect 
inflammatory-related proteins and ECM degradation-related proteins. Results from 
MTT assay indicated that KT decreased ATDC5 cell viability in a 
concentration-dependent manner. The expression of COX-2 was found to be 
downregulated in IL-1β-induced ATDC5 cells after treatment with KT, according to 
RT-qPCR and western blotting results. KT inhibited apoptosis and the expression 
levels of NO, iNOS and inflammatory-related proteins in IL-1β-induced ATDC5 
cells, while COX-2 overexpression reversed these inhibitory effects. However, 
the increased proliferation of IL-1β-induced ATDC5 cells after the stimulation 
of KT was decreased by COX-2 overexpression. Additionally, KT upregulated Bcl-2, 
SOD, type II collagen and aggrecan expression levels in IL-1β-induced ATDC5 
cells, whereas Bax, ROS, matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)1 and MMP13 expression 
levels were downregulated. KT promoted the proliferation of IL-1β-induced ATDC5 
cells, whereas COX-2 overexpression reversed the promotive effects of KT, 
revealing that KT could alleviate IL-1β-induced chondrocyte injury by 
suppressing COX-2 expression.

BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal survival 
aneuploidy. The increase in DS life expectancy further heightens the risk of 
dementia, principally early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD risk in DS is 
higher, considering that this population may also develop metabolic diseases 
such as obesity, dyslipidemias, and diabetes mellitus. The extra genetic 
material that characterizes DS causes an imbalance in the genetic dosage, 
including over-expression of AD's key pathophysiological molecules and the gene 
expression regulators, the microRNAs (miRNAs). Two miRNAs, chromosome 
21-encoded, miR-155, and let-7c, are associated with cognitive impairment and 
dementia in adults; but, expression dynamics and relationship with clinical 
variables during the DS's lifespan had remained hitherto unexplored.
METHODS: The anthropometric, clinical, biochemical, and profile expression of 
circulating miR-155 and let-7c were analyzed in a population of 52 control and 
50 DS subjects divided into the young group (Aged ≤20 years) and the adult group 
(Aged ≥21 years).
RESULTS: The expression changes for miR-155 were not significant; nevertheless, 
a negative correlation with HDL-Cholesterol concentrations was observed. 
Notably, let-7c was over-expressed in DS from young and old ages.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results suggest that let-7c plays a role from the early 
stages of DS's cognitive impairment while overexpression of miR-155 may be 
related to lipid metabolism changes. Further studies of both miRNAs will shed 
light on their potential as therapeutic targets to prevent or delay DS's 
cognitive impairment.

Background The effectiveness of a nurse-led in-hospital monitoring protocol with 
mobile ECG (iECG) was investigated for detecting atrial fibrillation in patients 
post-ischemic stroke or post-transient ischemic attack. The study aimed to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of using iECG during the initial hospital stay 
compared with standard 24-hour Holter monitoring. Methods and Results A Markov 
microsimulation model was constructed to simulate the lifetime health outcomes 
and costs. The rate of atrial fibrillation detection in iECG and Holter 
monitoring during the in-hospital phase and characteristics of modeled 
population (ie, age, sex, CHA2DS2-VASc) were informed by patient-level data. 
Costs related to recurrent stroke, stroke management, medications (new oral 
anticoagulants), and rehabilitation were included. The cost-effectiveness 
analysis outcome was calculated as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained. As results, monitoring patients with iECG post-stroke during 
the index hospitalization was associated with marginally higher costs (A$31 196) 
and greater benefits (6.70 quality-adjusted life-years) compared with 24-hour 
Holter surveillance (A$31 095 and 6.66 quality-adjusted life-years) over a 
20-year time horizon, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3013/ 
quality-adjusted life-years. Monitoring patients with iECG also contributed to 
lower recurrence of stroke and stroke-related deaths (140 recurrent strokes and 
20 deaths avoided per 10 000 patients). The probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
suggested iECG is highly likely to be a cost-effective intervention (100% 
probability). Conclusions A nurse-led iECG monitoring protocol during the acute 
hospital stay was found to improve the rate of atrial fibrillation detection and 
contributed to slightly increased costs and improved health outcomes. Using iECG 
to monitor patients post-stroke during initial hospitalization is recommended to 
complement routine care.

Hypothesis: Enhanced glucose availability and insulin resistance enhances an 
activated immune system and accounts for the obesity paradox.

Many studies have demonstrated an 'obesity paradox' where people with obesity 
have reduced mortality in the context of acute critical illnesses compared to 
people of normal weight. In contrast, obesity is associated with reduced life 
expectancy in the population in general and is associated with an increased risk 
for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other health problems. However, 
the absence of the metabolic syndrome is associated a lower mortality than when 
the metabolic syndrome is present regardless of body mass index status and the 
obesity paradox appears to only occur in association with the metabolic 
syndrome, but cardiorespiratory fitness modifies these outcomes. Enhanced 
glucose availability is important when the immune system is activated not only 
because it has an acute onset, a high consumption of glucose and is 
substantially an obligate glucose utilizer but also because it has priority over 
most other tissues and cells for the available glucose. Thus, for vulnerable 
populations, such as children with severe infections, this increases the risk of 
hypoglycaemia and death. The obesity paradox may be substantially a consequence 
of two features associated with obesity. One is endogenous glucose production 
(EGP). Obesity is associated with an increased capacity for EGP and thus is 
associated with enhanced glucose availability. Second is insulin resistance that 
reduces the amount of glucose metabolized by cells that are not obligate glucose 
utilizers and increases the release of fatty acids and glycerol from adipose 
stores that are alternative fuels for tissues and cells.

The development of compartmentalized neuron culture systems has been invaluable 
in the study of neuroinvasive viruses, including the alpha herpesviruses Herpes 
Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) and Pseudorabies Virus (PRV). This chapter provides 
updated protocols for assembling and culturing rodent embryonic superior 
cervical ganglion (SCG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in Campenot 
trichamber cultures. In addition, we provide several illustrative examples of 
the types of experiments that are enabled by Campenot cultures: (1) Using 
fluorescence microscopy to investigate axonal outgrowth/extension through the 
chambers, and alpha herpesvirus infection, intracellular trafficking, and 
cell-cell spread via axons. (2) Using correlative fluorescence microscopy and 
cryo electron tomography to investigate the ultrastructure of virus particles 
trafficking in axons.

During embryonic development, digits gradually emerge in a periodic pattern. 
Although genetic evidence indicates that digit formation results from a 
self-organizing process, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we 
find that convergent-extension tissue flows driven by active stresses underlie 
digit formation. These active stresses simultaneously shape cartilage 
condensations and lead to the emergence of a compressive stress region that 
promotes high activin/p-SMAD/SOX9 expression, thereby defining digit-organizing 
centers via a mechanical feedback. In Wnt5a mutants, such mechanical feedback is 
disrupted due to the loss of active stresses, organizing centers do not emerge, 
and digit formation is precluded. Thus, digit emergence does not result solely 
from molecular interactions, as was previously thought, but requires a 
mechanical feedback that ensures continuous coupling between phalanx 
specification and elongation. Our work, which links mechanical and molecular 
signals, provides a mechanistic context for the emergence of organizing centers 
that may underlie various developmental processes.

BACKGROUND: Currently, inequality in life expectancy across gender makes women 
outlive men. Adult women transit towards menopause around midlife accompanied by 
a series of natural physiological changes leading to several conditions such as 
osteoporosis, depression, and urinary incontinence, which puts them at a higher 
risk of having multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is often associated with poorer 
quality of life, leading to deteriorated work productivity and associated 
economic loss in midlife. Hence, this study aimed to determine the magnitude and 
correlates of early onset of multimorbidity and explore its linkages with 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among middle-aged women in India.
METHODS: We have utilized data from the first round of the Longitudinal Ageing 
Study in India, 2017-19. We included women aged 45-65 years (n = 23,951) for 
analysis. Descriptive data were presented. An ordered logistic regression was 
conducted and proportional odds were reported to identify the correlates of 
multimorbidity. To explore the linkages between multimorbidity and selected 
indicators of HRQoL, an array of regression models were executed.
RESULTS: Multimorbidity was reported amongst 29.8% of women in midlife. 
Chandigarh (PR-54.8 PER 100 women) and Punjab (PR-52.8 per 100 women) reported 
the highest prevalence of multimorbidity. Women with multimorbidity reported 
compromised HRQoL indicators such as self-rated health, work-limiting health 
conditions, mobility, and activities of daily living.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity is increasingly prevalent in midlife women 
associated with inferior quality of life. The reproductive health programs for 
women should consist of midlife women focusing on multimorbidity and overall 
well-being.

Osteoporosis is becoming a global health issue due to increased life expectancy. 
However, it is difficult to detect in its early stages owing to a lack of 
discernible symptoms. Hence, screening for osteoporosis with widely used dental 
panoramic radiographs would be very cost-effective and useful. In this study, we 
investigate the use of deep learning to classify osteoporosis from dental 
panoramic radiographs. In addition, the effect of adding clinical covariate data 
to the radiographic images on the identification performance was assessed. For 
objective labeling, a dataset containing 778 images was collected from patients 
who underwent both skeletal-bone-mineral density measurement and dental 
panoramic radiography at a single general hospital between 2014 and 2020. 
Osteoporosis was assessed from the dental panoramic radiographs using 
convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including EfficientNet-b0, -b3, and 
-b7 and ResNet-18, -50, and -152. An ensemble model was also constructed with 
clinical covariates added to each CNN. The ensemble model exhibited improved 
performance on all metrics for all CNNs, especially accuracy and AUC. The 
results show that deep learning using CNN can accurately classify osteoporosis 
from dental panoramic radiographs. Furthermore, it was shown that the accuracy 
can be improved using an ensemble model with patient covariates.

BACKGROUND: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a disabling and chronic genodermatosis 
characterized by mucocutaneous fragility with blister formation after minimal 
trauma. Severity ranges between very mild forms to extremely severe or lethal 
subtypes. Depending on disease subtypes, blisters may be localized also in 
larynx, bladder, esophagus, and most frequent disease complications are 
malnutrition, chronic anemia, osteoporosis, limb contracture and early 
development of squamous cell carcinomas. EB is classified into four major 
groups: EB simplex (EBS), junctional EB (JEB), dystrophic EB (DEB) and Kindler 
EB (KEB). No specific treatment is available; however, a multidisciplinary 
management is mandatory in order to treat the lesions, to prevent complication, 
and to give a psychological support to the patient and family members.
OBJECTIVE: To report the experience on a therapeutic education plan of an 
Italian reference center for epidermolysis bullosa in the last 30 years.
METHODS: In our study we included all patients with EB from 1990 to the present, 
dividing them into three age groups (< 5 years, > 5-12 years and > 12-18 years). 
The therapeutic plan involved all multidisciplinary team members, since born 
until adolescence. The multidisciplinary team has been progressively 
established; the dermatologists act as patient case manager, in collaboration 
with the pediatrician, endocrinologist, dietician, dentist, plastic surgeon, 
digestive surgeon, geneticist, psychologist and a dedicated nurse. Other 
dedicated specialists are involved upon patient needs.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen patients have been recruited and followed in our 
hospital since 1990. One hundred forty patients (65%) are on follow-up, 27 
patients (13%) died and only 11 (5%) were lost to follow-up. Our patients 
manifested the specific complications related to their EB subtype in keeping 
with the data reported in the literature. Eighteen (8%) patients affected with 
JEB severe died within the first year of life, 9 patients (5%) died for squamous 
cell carcinoma in adulthood and were affected with recessive DEB; only 1 patient 
died for squamous cell carcinoma at the age of 16.
CONCLUSIONS: An adequate management of EB patients require a multidisciplinary 
approach with an educational plan to guarantee an appropriate treatment and to 
support and accompany patients and their families since birth along life. The 
dynamic educational plan adopted in our hospital showed good clinical and 
psychological outcome in our population, allowing adherence to treatment, 
reducing the frequency of complications and improving life expectancy and 
quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer seriously threatens human health worldwide. Cancer cachexia 
is one of the life-threatening consequences that occurs commonly in patients 
with cancer, and severely worsens patient survival, prognosis and quality of 
life. Previous studies have demonstrated that cancer cachexia is closely related 
to differential metabolites and metabolic pathways based on metabolomics 
analysis. This scoping review protocol, therefore, aims to provide the strategy 
for a formal scoping review that will summarise the differential metabolites and 
related metabolic pathways of cachexia in patients with cancer.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The proposed scoping review will follow the Arksey and 
O'Malley's methodological framework, Levac et al's recommendations for applying 
this framework, and Peters' enhancements of the framework. The key information 
from the selected studies will be extracted, including author, year of 
publication, cachexia definition, country/origin, study design, setting, 
population and sample size, biological specimens, independent variables, 
independent variables' measure and statistical analysis. A summary of 
metabolites will be divided into several sections depending on the biological 
specimen. Differential metabolites will be compared between paired groups, and 
the number and names of related metabolic pathways will be counted and 
described. The reporting of this scoping review will be in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews checklist. This is a scoping review protocol and describes the 
planned review process and provides data examples extracted from a pilot study 
to confirm the feasibility of further investigation of the subject.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: An ethical approval is not required for this scoping 
review protocol, nor for the scoping review. The results of this scoping review 
will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal, or 
presentation at a national or international conference.

In any drug discovery effort, the identification of hits for further 
optimisation is of crucial importance. For peptide therapeutics, display 
technologies such as mRNA display have emerged as powerful methodologies to 
identify these desired de novo hit ligands against targets of interest. The 
diverse peptide libraries are genetically encoded in these technologies, 
allowing for next-generation sequencing to be used to efficiently identify the 
binding ligands. Despite the vast datasets that can be generated, current 
downstream methodologies, however, are limited by low throughput validation 
processes, including hit prioritisation, peptide synthesis, biochemical and 
biophysical assays. In this work we report a highly efficient strategy that 
combines bioinformatic analysis with state-of-the-art high throughput peptide 
synthesis to identify nanomolar cyclic peptide (CP) ligands of the human 
glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide receptor (hGIP-R). Furthermore, our 
workflow is able to discriminate between functional and remote binding 
non-functional ligands. Efficient structure-activity relationship analysis (SAR) 
combined with advanced in silico structural studies allow deduction of a 
thorough and holistic binding model which informs further chemical optimisation, 
including efficient half-life extension. We report the identification and design 
of the first de novo, GIP-competitive, incretin receptor family-selective CPs, 
which exhibit an in vivo half-life up to 10.7 h in rats. The workflow should be 
generally applicable to any selection target, improving and accelerating hit 
identification, validation, characterisation, and prioritisation for therapeutic 
development.
