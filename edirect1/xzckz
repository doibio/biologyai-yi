Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord and real-time 
processing of gait kinematics are powerful methods for the study of locomotion 
and the improvement of motor control after injury or in neurological disorders. 
Here, we describe equipment and surgical procedures that can be used to acquire 
chronic electromyographic (EMG) recordings from leg muscles and to implant 
targeted spinal cord stimulation systems that remain stable up to several months 
after implantation in rats and nonhuman primates. We also detail how to exploit 
these implants to configure electrical spinal cord stimulation policies that 
allow control over the degree of extension and flexion of each leg during 
locomotion. This protocol uses real-time processing of gait kinematics and 
locomotor performance, and can be configured within a few days. Once configured, 
stimulation bursts are delivered over specific spinal cord locations with 
precise timing that reproduces the natural spatiotemporal activation of 
motoneurons during locomotion. These protocols can also be easily adapted for 
the safe implantation of systems in the vicinity of the spinal cord and to 
conduct experiments involving real-time movement feedback and closed-loop 
controllers.

Increasing life expectancy is expected to lead to a corresponding increase in 
the prevalence of aortic valve disease (AVD). Further, the number of indications 
for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as a treatment option for AVD 
is expanding, with a growing role for echocardiography in its management. In 
this review we summarize the current literature on some newer echocardiographic 
modalities and the parameters they generate, with a particular focus on their 
prognostic and clinical value beyond conventional methods in the management of 
aortic stenosis, TAVR, and aortic regurgitation. Speckle tracking and 3D 
echocardiography are now increasingly being used in the management of AVD. For 
instance, global longitudinal strain, the best-studied speckle tracking 
echocardiographic parameter, can detect subtle subclinical cardiac dysfunction 
in patients with AVD that is not apparent using traditional echocardiographic 
techniques. The emerging technique of 3D full volume color Doppler 
echocardiography provides more accurate measurement of the severity of aortic 
regurgitation than 2D-proximal isovelocity surface area. These novel techniques 
are promising for evaluating and risk stratifying patients to optimize surgical 
interventions, predict recovery, and improve clinical outcomes.

The objective of this study was to investigate potential mediating effects of 
health-related quality of life between children's participation in organised 
sports and measures of adiposity. The sample consisted of 4116 children derived 
from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Participants were aged 10.32 
(SD = 0.47) years at baseline (2010), and followed up 24 and 48 months later. 
Participation in organised sports was assessed using child-completed time-use 
diary. Health-related quality of life and demographic data were reported by each 
child's primary parent. Measures of body mass index, body fat, and waist 
circumference were also taken at each Wave. Sport was indirectly associated with 
measures of body fat (β = -0.002, 95%CI -0.004, 0.000, p = .039) and waist 
circumference (β = -0.001, 95%CI -0.003, 0.000, p = .039) through the mediating 
effects of social functioning. Sport was also associated with body fat via 
physical functioning (β = -0.01, 95%CI -0.02, -0.003, p = .038), however, this 
was not replicated with other measures of adiposity. No other mediating effects 
were evident. Sport participation may enable children and adolescents to 
function well in groups and access social support which in turn promote health 
behaviours and influence adiposity. This may be one of multiple pathways through 
which sports participation is associated with adiposity. Replication and 
extension of these novel findings is warranted, as is a focus on the design and 
implementation of sports programs to maximise health benefits.

This paper explores the relationship between the prolongation of working life 
and subjective health. Drawing on a unique combination of longitudinal data and 
the results of a postal survey in Sweden, we investigate the health consequences 
of extending working life beyond the normal retirement age of 65. To do this, we 
compare the health status of two groups of retired people: one group who left 
the labour market completely at the age of 65, and a second group who remained 
in employment after the age of 65. Using a standard linear probability model and 
controlling for a range of socio-economic variables as well as previous labour 
market experiences, perceived life expectancy, pre-retirement income and health, 
our estimations show that those continuing to work after 65 on average display a 
6.8% higher probability of reporting better health during retirement than those 
leaving at the age of 65. However, we find that this positive correlation 
between the extension of working life and health is only transitory. After 
6 years of retirement, the health advantage of working after the normal 
retirement age disappears. Furthermore, we did not find any evidence that 
working after the age of 65 is positively correlated with physical fitness, 
self-reported depressive symptoms or well-being.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes paralysis, multisystem impairment and reduced 
life expectancy, as yet with no cure. Stem cell therapy can potentially replace 
lost neurons, promote axonal regeneration and limit scar formation, but an 
optimal stem cell source has yet to be found. Enteric neural stem cells (ENSC) 
isolated from the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract are an attractive source. Here, we used the chick embryo to assess the 
potential of ENSC to integrate within the developing spinal cord. In vitro, 
isolated ENSC formed extensive cell connections when co-cultured with spinal 
cord (SC)-derived cells. Further, qRT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of 
TuJ1+ neurons, S100+ glia and Sox10+ stem cells within ENSC neurospheres, as 
well as expression of key neuronal subtype genes, at levels comparable to SC 
tissue. Following ENSC transplantation to an ablated region of chick embryo SC, 
donor neurons were found up to 12 days later. These neurons formed bridging 
connections within the SC injury zone, aligned along the anterior/posterior 
axis, and were immunopositive for TuJ1. These data provide early proof of 
principle support for the use of ENSCs for SCI, and encourage further research 
into their potential for repair.

BACKGROUND: This study examined whether delivering behavioral activation for 
depression through telehealth is cost-effective compared to in-person care.
METHODS: This was a randomized, noninferiority trial, with participants assigned 
to 1 of 2 arms of 8-week behavioral activation therapy: in-person or via 
telehealth. Primary clinical outcomes included measures of depression (Geriatric 
Depression Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM-IV) at 12 months follow-up. Quality of life was assessed using the 
36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Economic outcomes included the difference in 
health services utilization costs between 1 year post-intervention and 1 year 
pre-intervention, as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for differences in cost based on mean travel and 
median travel relative to the 3 primary outcomes and QALYs.
RESULTS: 241 participants were enrolled and completed study procedures between 
April 2007 and July 2012. Post-intervention, veterans treated in-person had a 
mean of $2,998 higher VA health care utilization costs relative to their 
pre-intervention utilization costs, while veterans treated via telehealth had a 
mean of $870.91 higher costs post-intervention relative to pre-intervention. The 
difference between bootstrap mean and median QALYs was not significantly 
different from zero.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention costs for telehealth were higher relative 
to in-person care, veterans receiving behavioral activation via telehealth had 
lower health utilization costs 1 year after the intervention than those 
receiving care in person while QALYs were approximately the same. These results 
demonstrate the noninferiority of telehealth in treating depression in veterans 
with respect to QALYs and a large and significant cost benefit of using 
telehealth in terms of health services utilization post-intervention.

To prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis, Hunan Province 
launched a free syphilis screening and treatment programme in 2011. Thus far, 
the programme has been implemented for 6 years. This study aimed to assess 
progress toward the elimination of MTCT of syphilis in Hunan Province from 
2011-2016. Estimates of syphilis-related adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) were 
based on the health service delivery model developed by the WHO, which were then 
translated into disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Default values in the 
model were replaced by a Chinese version. The progress of this programme was 
assessed through the reduction of estimated DALYs with and without screening and 
treatment services. The results showed that the estimated number of 
syphilis-related APOs in Hunan Province from 2011 to 2016 was 3,840, more than 
70% of which occurred among women who had at least one antenatal care visit but 
were not screened or treated for syphilis during pregnancy. The public health 
burden resulting from maternal syphilis-related APOs was 192,528 DALYs over six 
years, and with the current screening and treatment coverage, approximately 
163,794 expected DALYs (46%) were averted. Our estimates indicate that in Hunan 
Province, syphilis in pregnancy continues to be an important cause of APOs, 
which can lead to substantial perinatal morbidity and mortality. Approximately 
half of the expected public health burden resulting from syphilis-related APOs 
was averted by the current screening and treatment services, which suggests 
progress toward the elimination of MTCT of syphilis in Hunan Province.

The protein kinase Dyrk1A modulates several processes relevant to the 
development or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), e. g. through 
phosphorylation of tau protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP) as well as 
proteins involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of tau pre-mRNA. 
Therefore, Dyrk1A has been proposed as a potential target for the treatment of 
AD. However, the co-inhibition of other closely related kinases of the same 
family of protein kinases (e.g. Dyrk1B and Dyrk2) or kinases from other families 
such as Clk1 limits the use of Dyrk1A inhibitors, as this may cause 
unpredictable side effects especially over long treatment periods. Herein, we 
describe the design and synthesis of a series of amide functionalized 
2,4-bispyridyl thiophene compounds, of which the 4-fluorobenzyl amide derivative 
(31b) displayed the highest potency against Dyrk1A and remarkable selectivity 
over closely related kinases (IC50: Dyrk1A = 14.3 nM; Dyrk1B = 383 nM, 
Clk1 > 2 μM). This degree of selectivity over the frequently hit off-targets has 
rarely been achieved to date. Additionally, 31b inhibited Dyrk1A in intact cells 
with high efficacy (IC50 = 79 nM). Furthermore, 31b displayed a high metabolic 
stability in vitro with a half-life of 2 h. Altogether, the benzamide and 
benzylamide extension at the 2,4-bispyridyl thiophene core improved several key 
properties, giving access to compound suitable for future in vivo studies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differential improvements in life expectancy 
associated with participation in various sports.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) is a prospective 
population study that included detailed questionnaires regarding participation 
in different types of sports and leisure-time physical activity. The 8577 
participants were followed for up to 25 years for all-cause mortality from their 
examination between October 10, 1991, and September 16, 1994, until March 22, 
2017. Relative risks were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models with 
full adjustment for confounding variables.
RESULTS: Multivariable-adjusted life expectancy gains compared with the 
sedentary group for different sports were as follows: tennis, 9.7 years; 
badminton, 6.2 years; soccer, 4.7 years; cycling, 3.7 years; swimming, 3.4 
years; jogging, 3.2 years; calisthenics, 3.1 years; and health club activities, 
1.5 years.
CONCLUSION: Various sports are associated with markedly different improvements 
in life expectancy. Because this is an observational study, it remains uncertain 
whether this relationship is causal. Interestingly, the leisure-time sports that 
inherently involve more social interaction were associated with the best 
longevity-a finding that warrants further investigation.

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a severe parenchymal lung disease 
characterized by an intense deposition of collagen in the interstitial spaces. 
The introduction of anti-fibrotic drugs increased patients' life expectancy 
highlighting the role of comorbidities in patients' management and prognosis. 
IPF is frequently associated with other diseases mainly because of its onset 
during middle age and sometimes because of the presence of common pathogenic 
pathways such as in the case of lung cancer. Comorbidities may differently 
influence prognosis of IPF patients. However, except for major impacting ones as 
LC, PH and cardiovascular diseases, data exploring their impact on prognosis are 
still few and sometimes conflicting highlighting the need of new large and 
targeted studies. In this review we discuss the current knowledge on the most 
common comorbidities associated with IPF (cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary 
hypertension, lung cancer, emphysema, gastro-oesophageal reflux and depression), 
focusing on their prognostic role.

Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) is one of the most devastating 
complications of cancer. Patients often present with a history of progressive 
pain, paralysis, sensory loss, progressive spinal deformity, and loss of 
sphincter control. It is an emergency that requires rapid decision making on the 
part of several specialists, given the risk of permanent spinal cord injury or 
death. The goals of treatment in spinal metastases are pain control and 
improvement of neurological function in order to achieve better quality of life 
(QoL). The standard of care in most cases is rapid initiation of corticosteroids 
in combination with either surgical decompression in case of an operable 
candidate, followed by radiation therapy (RT) or RT alone. Surgery is associated 
with improved outcomes, but is not appropriate for many patients presenting with 
advanced symptoms of MSCC, such as paralysis, or those with a poor performance 
status, or cachexic state, as well as altered mental conditions, co-morbidities, 
surgical risks, and limited life expectancy. On the other hand, aggressive 
surgical treatment and post-operative RT is advocated for those with more 
favorable prognosis, or who are expected to have higher neurological recovery 
potential. Many candidates may require for combined anterior and posterior 
approaches to effectively deal with the compressive pathology and stabilize the 
spine. Most patients are presently treated by primary RT, given with the aim of 
improving function and symptom management. However, there is still debate 
regarding the most appropriate RT schedule. Rehabilitation can serve to relieve 
symptoms, QoL, enhance functional independence, and prevent further 
complications. Ambulatory status has been found to be an important prognostic 
factor for patients with MSCC.

Our life expectancy is increasing, leading to a rise in the ageing population. 
Ageing is associated with a decline in physiological function and adaptive 
capacity. Altered GI physiology can affect the amount and types of nutrients 
digested and absorbed as well as impact the intestinal microbiota. The 
intestinal microbiota is considered a key player in our health, and a variety of 
studies have reported that microbiota composition is changing during ageing. 
Since ageing is associated with a decline in GI function and adaptive capacity, 
it is crucial to obtain insights into this decline and how this is related to 
the intestinal microbiota in the elderly. Hence, in this review we focus on 
age-related changes in GI physiology and function, changes of the intestinal 
microbiota with ageing and frailty, how these are associated and how intestinal 
microbiota-targeted interventions may counteract these changes.

OBJECTIVES: Several governments have taken measures to encourage prolonged 
working. It is therefore likely that older adults with a chronic disease are 
required to work longer in poor self-perceived health (SPH) than before. This 
study examines to what extent working life expectancy (WLE) in good and poor SPH 
changed between 1992 and 2016 in workers with a chronic disease from age 55 
years onwards.
METHODS: Three cohorts (1992, 2002 and 2012) of workers with a chronic disease 
aged 55-65 years were selected from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam with 
a 3-year follow-up each (n=705). A three-state survival model was estimated, 
modelling transitions between states 'working with good SPH', 'working with poor 
SPH' and 'exit from work'. WLEs were estimated using Multistate Modelling and 
Estimating Life Expectancies using Continuous Time in R.
RESULTS: Of the workers with a chronic disease, total WLEs at age 55 years were 
5.2, 5.7 and 6.8 years in cohorts 1992, 2002 and 2012, respectively. Workers 
initially having poor SPH, had total WLE of 4.7 years of which 2.4 years in poor 
SPH in cohort 1992. These workers had total WLE of 5.2 years of which 3.3 years 
in poor SPH in cohort 2002, and total WLE of 6.5 years of which 3.6 years in 
poor SPH in cohort 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: Workers with a chronic disease extended their working lives by 
approximately 18 months from 1992 to 2016. In the first decade, unhealthy WLE 
increased, whereas in the second decade, healthy WLE increased, among both 
workers in general and workers initially having poor SPH.

Dynamic resource allocation for prevention, screening, and treatment 
interventions in population disease management has received much attention in 
recent years due to excessive healthcare costs. In this paper, our goal is to 
design a model and an efficient algorithm to optimize sequential intervention 
policies under resource constraints to improve population health outcomes. We 
consider a discrete-time finite-horizon budget allocation problem with disease 
progression within a closed birth-cohort population. To address the 
computational challenges associated with large-state and multiple-period dynamic 
decision-making problems, we propose a low-fidelity approximation that preserves 
the population dynamics under a stationary policy. To improve the healthcare 
interventions in terms of population health outcomes, we then embed the 
low-fidelity approximation into a high-fidelity optimization model to 
efficiently identify a good non-stationary sequential intervention policy. Our 
approach is illustrated by a numerical example of screening and treatment policy 
implementation for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection over a budget 
planning period. We numerically compare our Multi-Fidelity Rollout Algorithm 
(MF-RA) to a grid search approach and demonstrate the similarity of sequential 
policy trends and closeness of overall health outcomes measured by 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the total number of individuals that 
undergo screening and treatment for different annual budgets and birth-cohorts. 
We also show how our approach scales well to problems with high dimensionality 
due to many decision periods by studying time to elimination of HCV.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Certain patients with heart failure (HF) are unable to 
tolerate spironolactone therapy due to hyperkalemia. Patiromer is a novel agent 
used to treat hyperkalemia and has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and 
well-tolerated. The potential clinical outcomes and economic value of using 
patiromer and spironolactone in patients with HF unable to otherwise tolerate 
spironolactone due to hyperkalemia are unclear. The objective of this analysis 
was to model the potential pharmacoeconomic value of using patiromer and 
spironolactone in patients with a history of hyperkalemia that prevents them 
from utilizing spironolactone.
METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with patiromer, 
spironolactone, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in 
patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV HF compared with 
ACEI alone. A Markov model was constructed to simulate a cohort of 65-year-old 
patients diagnosed with HF from the payer perspective across the lifetime 
horizon. Clinical inputs were derived from the RALES and OPAL-HK randomized 
trials of spironolactone and patiromer, respectively. Utility estimates and 
costs were derived from the literature and list prices. Outcomes assessed 
included hospitalization, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and 
probability sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the 
model findings.
RESULTS: Treatment with patiromer-spironolactone-ACEI was projected to increase 
longevity compared with ACEI alone (5.29 vs. 4.62 life-years gained, 
respectively), greater QALYs (2.79 vs. 2.60), and costs (US$28,200 vs. 
US$18,200), giving an ICER of US$52,700 per QALY gained. The ICERs ranged from 
US$40,000 to US$85,800 per QALY gained in 1-way sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the use of spironolactone-patiromer-ACEI 
may provide clinical benefit and good economic value in patients with NYHA class 
III-IV HF unable to tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia.

Warming affects phenological processes such as spring bud break and autumnal bud 
set, and also growth rates of trees. Recently, it has been shown that these 
physiological processes also may be influenced by the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) part 
of the solar spectrum, and there are reasons to expect that the two 
environmental factors induce interactive effects when acting in concert. In this 
study, our aim was to elucidate how experimental enhancements in temperature and 
UV-B, alone and in combination, affect growth and seasonal phenology of Eurasian 
aspen (Populus tremula) over several growing seasons (three years). Moreover, we 
tested how environmentally induced changes in phenology affect the growth 
achieved over each season, that is, the importance of a prolonged growing season 
for growth yield. The plants grew in an outdoor experiment with modulated 
enhancements of temperature and UV-B during the growing season. Both UV-B and 
temperature enhancement affected bud set dates, while bud break dates were only 
affected by temperature enhancement. Temperature delayed bud set in all years, 
but gradually less over years, while UV-B yielded earlier bud set the first year 
but showed a delayed response the following years. Bud break was always earlier 
under temperature enhancement. The experimentally induced extension of the 
growing season in both ends had a positive effect of growth throughout the 
three-year period. However, the reduced responsiveness of bud set to both 
enhancement treatments suggest that the plants gradually acclimated to the 
modified climate, a finding that should also be investigated for other tree 
species.

AIMS: Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) is a NAD+ booster with wide physiological 
repercussion including the improvement on glucose and lipid homeostasis, 
increasing the life expectancy in mammals. However, the effects of NR on 
metabolism are only partially known. Here, we evaluated the effects of NR on the 
thermogenic response, highlighting the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in lean mice.
MAIN METHODS: Male C57BL/67 mice were supplement with NR (400 mg/Kg/day) during 
5 weeks. The Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) and 
thermographic images were used to evaluated the physiological effects of NR 
treatment. The BAT were extracted and analyzed by Western Blotting and qPCR. 
Also, bioinformatics analyses were performed to establish the connection between 
the NAD+ synthesis pathway in BAT and thermogenic response in several isogenic 
strains of BXD mice.
KEY FINDINGS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes involved in NAD+ 
synthesis (Nampt and Nmnat1) in the BAT were negatively correlated with body 
weight and fat mass. The heat map showed a strong positive correlation between 
Nampt and Ucp1 mRNA in BAT and body temperature in several strains of BXD lean 
mice. The experimental approaches demonstrated that oral NR supplementation 
reduced the abdominal visceral fat depots, with discrete impact on oxygen 
consumption in C57BL/6J mice. Interestingly, NR significantly increased the body 
temperature, and this phenomenon was accompanied by high levels of UCP1 protein 
content and Pgc1α mRNA in BAT.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated the oral NR supplementation was sufficient 
to induce the thermogenic response in lean mice changing the BAT metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas (GBM) are one of the most aggressive tumor of the 
central nervous system with an average life expectancy of only 1-2 years after 
diagnosis, even with the use of advanced treatments with surgery, radiation, and 
chemotherapy. There are several anticancer drugs with alkylating properties that 
have been used in the therapy of malignant gliomas. Temozolomide (TMZ) is one of 
them, widely used even in combination with ionizing radiation. However, the main 
disadvantage of using these types of drugs in the treatment of GBM is the 
development of cancer drug resistance. Research of bioactive compounds with 
anticancer activity has been heavily explored.
PURPOSE: This review focuses on a carotenoid and a phlorotannin present in 
seaweed, namely fucoxanthin and phloroglucinol, and their anticancer activity 
against glioblastoma. The combination of natural compounds with conventional 
drugs is also discussed.
CONCLUSION: Several natural compounds existing in seaweeds, such as fucoxanthin 
and phoroglucinol, have shown cytotoxic activity in models in vitro and in vivo, 
acting through different molecular mechanisms, such as antioxidant, 
antiproliferative, DNA damage/DNA repair, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic and 
antimetastic. Within the scope of interactions with conventional drugs, there 
are evidences that some seaweed compounds could be used to potentiate the action 
of anticancer drugs. However, their effects and mechanisms of action, alone or 
in combination with anticancer drugs, namely TMZ, in glioblastoma cell, still 
few explored and require more attention due to the unquestionable high potential 
of these marine compounds.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of three testing strategies with or 
without light microscopic Gram-stained smear (GSS) evaluation for the detection 
of anogenital gonorrhoea among men who have sex with men (MSM) at the Amsterdam 
STI clinic using a healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: Three testing strategies for MSM were compared: (1) GSS in symptomatic 
MSM only (currently practised strategy), (2) no GSS and (3) GSS in symptomatic 
and asymptomatic MSM. The three testing protocols include testing with nucleic 
acid amplification test to verify the GSS results in (1) and (3), or as the only 
test in (2). A transmission model was employed to calculate the influence of the 
testing strategies on the prevalence of anogenital gonorrhoea over 10 years. An 
economic model combined cost data on medical consultations, tests and treatment 
and utility data to estimate the number of epididymitis cases and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) associated with gonorrhoea. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the testing scenarios were estimated. 
Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: No GSS testing compared with GSS in symptomatic MSM only (current 
strategy) resulted in nine extra epididymitis cases (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI): 2-22), 72 QALYs lost (95% UI: 59-187) and €7300 additional costs (95% UI: 
-€185 000 (i.e.cost-saving) to €407 000) over 10 years. GSS testing in both 
symptomatic and asymptomatic MSM compared with GSS in symptomatic MSM only 
resulted in one prevented epididymitis case (95% UI: 0-2), 1.1 QALY gained (95% 
UI: 0.1-3.3), €148 000 additional costs (95% UI: €86 000 to-€217 000) and an 
ICER of €177 000 (95% UI: €67 000-to €705 000) per QALY gained over 10 years. 
The results were robust in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: GSS for symptomatic MSM only is cost-effective compared with no GSS 
for MSM and with GSS for both symptomatic and asymptomatic MSM.

The Functional Benefits of Strabismus Surgery.

Kushner BJ(1).

Author information:
(1)a Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences University of Wisconsin , 
Madison, Wisconsin.

When performed prior to visual maturity, strabismus surgery can result in the 
development or recovery of binocularity. When strabismus surgery is performed 
after visual maturity, the functional benefits of the surgery should be 
dichotomized according to whether the onset of the strabismus was before or 
after visual maturity. If the onset was after visual maturity, patients 
typically are diplopic. Specific success rates for eliminating diplopia vary 
according to the nature of the strabismus; however, overall the success rate is 
quite high. There is a common misperception that surgery in adults for 
strabismus that began prior to visual maturity is merely cosmetic. Numerous 
studies contradict this misconception. Even if the strabismus has been 
longstanding, most adults will experience some improvement in binocular function 
after strabismus surgery. In esotropic patients, this improvement typically 
takes the form of an expansion of binocular visual fields; however, some 
patients may also regain stereopsis. There are many psychosocial benefits to 
adult strabismus surgery. This is reflected in the finding that the majority of 
adults surveyed with strabismus would trade a portion of their life expectancy 
to be rid of their strabismus.

BACKGROUND: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disease affecting 
children and young adults in Canada. It is a multi-system disease, however lung 
disease is largely responsible for mortality. Treatment advances have resulted 
in increased life expectancy and a subsequent need to better understand 
psychosocial issues associated with quality of life in adults living with CF. 
Emerging research suggests that anxiety and depression are related to poorer 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in CF patients, but there is little 
research examining cognitive processes, such as breathlessness catastrophizing. 
The present study addresses this gap in the literature.
METHODS: Participants in this study are based on a convenience sample of 
patients recruited during their regular CF clinic appointments at a tertiary
