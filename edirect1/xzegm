Time from birth or hatching to the first shed (postnatal ecdysis) in snakes 
ranges from about an hour to several weeks depending upon the species. We 
assessed patterns in time to postnatal ecdysis in 102 snake species for which we 
could source appropriate information, covering 2.6% of all extant snake species, 
and related measures to various biological traits. Reconstruction revealed 
ancestral time to postnatal ecdysis to be 11 days. Since time to postnatal 
ecdysis can be shorter or longer than the ancestral state, we argue that there 
are several competing drivers for time to postnatal ecdysis. A reduced time to 
postnatal ecdysis has evolved in several lineages, commonly in ambush-foraging, 
viviparous vipers, while extended time to postnatal ecdysis is associated with 
oviparous species with maternal care. Of central importance is the impact of 
postnatal ecdysis on the scent levels of neonates, resulting in a reduction of 
time to postnatal ecdysis in chemically cryptic species, while the pivotal role 
of scent in mother-neonate recognition has resulted in the retention or 
extension of time to postnatal ecdysis. We showed that postnatal ecdysis 
improves chemical crypsis. The patterns revealed in this study suggest that 
measures of time to postnatal ecdysis can provide insights into the biology of 
snakes and be used as an indicator of certain life history traits.

The aim of the present cross-sectional exploratory pilot study was to analyze 
the ability of the Phase Angle (PhA) to predict physical function, muscle 
strength and bone indicators, upon adjusting for potential confounders [age, 
sex, lean mass, and body mass index (BMI)]. This study included 56 physically 
independent older adults (age, 68.29 ± 3.01 years; BMI, 28.09 ± 4.37 kg/m2). A 
multi-frequency segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to measure 
PhA at 50 KHz. Additionally, physical function was assessed through four 
functional capacity tests [30-sec chair-stand; seated medicine ball throw 
(SMBT); timed up & go; and 6-min walking test (6 MWT)], muscle strength through 
the handgrip test (dominant side) and maximal isokinetic strength of the 
dominant knee flexor and extensor. Moreover, bone indicators and body 
composition were assessed through the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. PhA was 
significantly associated with SMBT (r = 0.375, effect size (ES) = moderate); 
6 MWT (r = 0.396, ES = moderate); 30-sec chair-stand (rho = 0.314, 
ES = moderate); knee extension (rho = 0.566, ES = large) and flexion (r = 0.459, 
ES = moderate); handgrip (rho = 0.432, ES = moderate); whole-body bone mineral 
content (BMC) (r = 0.316, ES = moderate); femoral neck BMC (r = 0.469, 
ES = moderate); and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) (rho = 0.433, 
ES = moderate). Additionally, the results of multiple regression analysis 
demonstrated that PhA is significantly associated with SMBT (p < 0.001; 
R2 = 0.629), 6 MWT (p = 0.004; R2 = 0.214), knee extension (p < 0.001; 
R2 = 0.697), knee flexion (p < 0.001; R2 = 0.355), handgrip test (p < 0.001; 
R2 = 0.774), whole-body BMC (p < 0.001; R2 = 0.524), femoral neck BMC 
(p = 0.001; R2 = 0.249), and femoral neck BMD (p = 0.020; R2 = 0.153). The 
results of the preliminary analysis suggested that PhA is linked to muscle 
strength and some factors related to physical function and bone quality in 
community-dwelling older adults.

BACKGROUND: Racial inequities in life expectancy vary significantly across US 
cities, with city-level gaps ranging from zero to more than 10 years. Given that 
these inequities are rooted in racism and maintained through social structures 
and policies, population-level solutions are needed. Local health departments 
(LHD) are well-situated to lead these types of changes.
METHODS: We conducted an environmental scan and document review of formal health 
plans of the LHDs with jurisdictions covering the 30 most populous US cities. We 
assessed the inclusion of equity priorities and specific and measurable equity 
goals. Secondary outcomes related to organizational structures, data, formal 
declarations, and other practices were also assessed. Data were collected 
between January and August 2022.
RESULTS: The extent of focus on racial equity in the identified strategic health 
plans varied. Less than half of the cities with a formal public health plan (13 
of 29) listed racial health equity as an area of focus. Only seven cities (all 
of which had a health plan focusing on racial health equity) had specific goals 
related to racial health equity. Twenty-five LHDs provided local data on racial 
health inequities. All but seven cities had declared racism a public health 
crisis. About half of the LHDs had positions or divisions focused on racial 
equity, or specified equity as an area of focus for Covid-19 efforts.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that few large cities translate growing 
support for anti-racism into their formal planning. While most LHDs acknowledge 
(and provide data pointing to) gaps in racial health equity in their 
jurisdictions, more attention is needed to incorporate specific and measurable 
racial health equity goals into strategic plans, and provide adequate structure 
and resources to attain those goals.

LDPE-Natural Rubber Composite Film as Active Packaging: A Paradigm Shift in 
Oxygen Scavengers.

Pradesh, India.

Oxygen scavenging films, an emerging type of active packaging, play a crucial 
role in preserving the freshness and quality of food products. In this study, we 
proposed an extruded film made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with 5% 
natural rubber (NR) as the oxygen scavenging film. Characterization of the film 
revealed that its morphological and barrier properties remained intact, while 
the elongation attribute was enhanced. The obtained film was standardized for 
activation scavenging kinetics by varying the UV dose (time and distance). At 
the optimal UV dose, the film exhibited a total scavenging capacity of 61 cc/g. 
To assess the film's functionality, FTIR spectra were analyzed before and after 
exposure to oxygen, confirming the film's ability to scavenge oxygen based on 
observed peaks at 1718 and 3425 cm-1. Considering that bread and khoa (fatty 
food) are sensitive to oxygen, they were selected for testing the application of 
the oxygen scavenging film. Sensory analysis of bread samples, including 
appearance and mold formation, as well as microbial load studies, indicated that 
the shelf life of bread increased from 2-3 days (control) to 4-5 days when 
packed in the NR-based film and stored at 27 ± 2 °C. Similarly, when applied to 
khoa, the film extended its shelf life by 3 days compared to the control while 
maintaining sensory attributes and preserving nutritional value, such as fatty 
acids. In general, the developed oxygen scavenging film effectively prevents the 
detrimental effects of oxygen on food products, leading to an extension of their 
shelf life. This has significant implications for the food industry, as it helps 
mitigate the negative consequences of oxygen exposure and enhances the product 
shelf life.

BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with depression 
in later life.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure the impact of ACEs on life expectancy 
with depression (DLE) and to assess how educational attainment affected 
expectations.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study used data on 5597 participants from the 
English Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006-2013).
METHODS: Depression was assessed through the eight-item short version of the 
Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression. We used discrete-multistate life 
table models to estimate total life expectancy and life expectancy with 
depression.
RESULTS: Older adults with ACEs had longer DLE and a higher proportion of 
remaining life with depression compared with those without ACEs. For example, 
men aged 60 years with ACEs could expect to live 5.2 (95 % confidence interval 
(CI): 4.2, 6.2) years with depression compared with 2.8 (95 % CI: 2.3, 3.3) 
years for men without ACEs. Women aged 60 years who reported ACEs could expect 
to live 9.4 (95 % CI: 7.6, 11.1) years with depression compared with 6.0 (95 % 
CI: 5.1, 7.0) years for women without ACEs. With a high level of educational 
attainment, older adults from younger cohorts with ACEs lived fewer depression 
years and spent a higher proportion of their life being free of depression than 
adults with ACEs and had a low level of educational attainment.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that ACEs may increase years of life with 
depression among U.K. adults. Meanwhile, high educational attainment could 
mitigate the mental health burden associated with ACEs.

The genus Salvia L. (Lamiaceae) comprises myriad distinct medicinal herbs, with 
terpenoids as one of their major active chemical groups. Abietane-type 
diterpenoids (ATDs), such as tanshinones and carnosic acids, are specific to 
Salvia and exhibit taxonomic chemical diversity among lineages. To elucidate how 
ATD chemical diversity evolved, we carried out large-scale metabolic and 
phylogenetic analyses of 71 Salvia species, combined with enzyme function, 
ancestral sequence and chemical trait reconstruction, and comparative genomics 
experiments. This integrated approach showed that the lineage-wide ATD 
diversities in Salvia were induced by differences in the oxidation of the 
terpenoid skeleton at C-20, which was caused by the functional divergence of the 
cytochrome P450 subfamily CYP76AK. These findings present a unique pattern of 
chemical diversity in plants that was shaped by the loss of enzyme activity and 
associated catalytic pathways.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and severe psychiatric disorder associated 
with significant medical morbidity and reduced life expectancy. In this study, 
we assessed accelerated epigenetic aging in individuals with BD using various 
DNA methylation (DNAm)-based markers. For this purpose, we used five epigenetic 
clocks (Horvath, Hannum, EN, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) and a DNAm-based telomere 
length clock (DNAmTL). DNAm profiles were obtained using Infinium 
MethylationEPIC Arrays from whole-blood samples of 184 individuals with BD. We 
also estimated blood cell counts based on DNAm levels for adjustment. 
Significant correlations between chronological age and each epigenetic age 
estimated using the six different clocks were observed. Following adjustment for 
blood cell counts, we found that the six epigenetic AgeAccels (age 
accelerations) were significantly associated with the body mass index. GrimAge 
AgeAccel was significantly associated with male sex, smoking status and 
childhood maltreatment. DNAmTL AgeAccel was significantly associated with 
smoking status. Overall, this study showed that distinct epigenetic clocks are 
sensitive to different aspects of aging process in BD. Further investigations 
with comprehensive epigenetic clock analyses and large samples are required to 
confirm our findings of potential determinants of an accelerated epigenetic 
aging in BD.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis for 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA) over a 10-year follow up period.
METHODS: Two-hundred and twelve patients were randomised to receive either a 
Kinemax or a Triathlon TKA. Patients were assessed pre-operatively, and at 
6 months, and 1, 3, 7 and 10 years postoperatively. The costs of the primary and 
revision surgery were accounted for. One-year quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gain was used to estimate 10-year gains using the established annual health gain 
discounts.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients died and eight were revised during the follow up 
period. Overall QALY gain per patient over the 10-year period was 2.594 and the 
cost per patient was £6559, which resulted in a cost per QALY of £2761 at 10 
years. The Triathlon group had a significantly greater QALY gain compared with 
the Kinemax (mean difference (MD) 0.53, 95% CI 0.03-1.03, P = 0.02), which 
resulted in a cost per QALY for the Triathlon group of £2521 compared with £3107 
for the Kinemax group at 10 years. The 5% annual discount resulted in a 
significantly lower QALY gain (MD 0.135, 95% CI 0.201-0.354, P = 0.002), whereas 
the 3.5% annual discount resulted in non-significant difference in QALY gain 
compared with the actual gain (MD 0.021, 95% CI -0.084 to 0.077, P = 0.292).
CONCLUSIONS: TKA was a cost-effective intervention, and the Triathlon was 
associated with a greater cost effectiveness at 10 years. The 3.5% annual 
discounts for QALY gain would seem to be the most accurate, with an 
underestimation being observed with the 5% discount.

BACKGROUND: An economic evaluation was performed alongside an RCT investigating 
flap fixation in reducing seroma formation after mastectomy. The evaluation 
focused on the first year following mastectomy and assessed cost-effectiveness 
from a health care and societal perspective.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted between 2014 and 2018 in four 
Dutch breast clinics. Patients with an indication for mastectomy or modified 
radical mastectomy were randomly assigned to: conventional closure (CON), flap 
fixation with sutures (FFS) or flap fixation with tissue glue (FFG). Health care 
costs, patient and family costs and costs due to productivity losses were 
assessed. Outcomes were expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs): the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 
Bootstrapping techniques, sensitivity and secondary analyses were employed to 
address uncertainty.
RESULTS: The FFS-group yielded most QALYs (0.810; 95%-CI 0.755-0.856), but also 
incurred the highest mean costs at twelve months (€10.416; 95%-CI 8.231-12.930). 
CON was the next best alternative with 0.794 QALYs (95%-CI 0.733-0.841) and mean 
annual costs of €10.051 (95%-CI 8.255-12.044). FFG incurred fewer QALYs and 
higher costs, when compared to the CON group. The ICER of FFS compared to CON 
was €22.813/QALY. Applying a willingness to pay threshold in the Netherlands of 
€20.000/QALY, the probability that FFS was cost-effective was 42%, compared to 
37% and 21% for CON and FFG, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of FFS following mastectomy, versus CON and 
FFG, is uncertain from a societal perspective. Yet, from a health care and 
hospital perspective FFS is likely to be the most cost-effective intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To justify the up front risks of offering elective interventions for 
intermittent claudication (IC), patients should have reasonable life expectancy 
to derive durable clinical benefits. Open surgery for chronic limb threatening 
ischaemia (CLTI) is maximally beneficial in patients surviving ≥ 2 years. The 
aim was to assess long term survival after IC and CLTI interventions.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort analysis, the Vascular Quality Initiative 
(VQI) registry from 1 January 2010 to 31 May 2021 was queried for peripheral 
vascular intervention (PVI), infra-inguinal bypasses (IIB), and supra-inguinal 
bypasses (SIB) for IC and CLTI across 286 US centres. VQI linkage to Medicare 
insurance claims provided five year survival data. Multivariable analysis 
identified factors associated with five year mortality.
RESULTS: There were 31 457 PVIs (44.7% IC, 55.3% CLTI), 7 978 IIBs (26.9% IC, 
73.1% CLTI), and 2 149 SIBs (50.1% IC, 49.9% CLTI) recorded in the VQI. Among 
the PVI, IIB, and SIB cohorts, average ages were 75, 73, and 72 years, 
respectively. Respective five year mortality after PVI for IC and CLTI was 37.2% 
and 71.1%; after IIB for IC and CLTI it was 37.8% and 60%; and after SIB for IC 
and CLTI it was 33.8% and 53.8%. On multivariable analysis, across all 
procedures, end stage renal disease, CLTI, congestive heart failure, anaemia, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior amputation were independently 
associated with increased mortality. Pre-admission home living and pre-operative 
aspirin use were independently associated with decreased mortality.
CONCLUSION: Long term survival in Medicare patients undergoing interventions in 
VQI centres for peripheral arterial disease is poor. Two thirds of CLTI patients 
and over one third of IC patients were not alive at five years. Intervening for 
IC in patients with high mortality risk should be avoided. For CLTI patients 
identified with decreased survival likelihood, intervention durability may be 
less important than invasiveness. Pre-operative medical optimisation should 
always be undertaken.

Iron overload (IO) is probably as toxic in elderly patients with low-risk 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) as in young thalassemic patients. This impact is 
more difficult to demonstrate because of associated comorbidities. 
Cardiovascular disease increases vulnerability to the toxic effects of IO. In 
recent years, registry studies have shown a survival benefit of Iron Chelation 
Therapy (ICT) in these patients. These findings are now corroborated by an 
improvement in event-free survival in a single randomized study: the Telesto 
study. The EFS curves separate after two years of follow-up. This indicates 
inertia in the occurrence of complications. The benefits of ICT are also very 
slowly being revealed. It is possible to offer ICT to patients with 
transfusion-dependent MDS with a life expectancy of at least two years. In 
Telesto, patients had a serum ferritin (F) level of at least 1000ng/mL, 
recommendations using this F threshold as a trigger for chelation seem to be 
reinforced. It remains an open question whether chelation should be started 
earlier for effective suppression of IO-related oxidative stress. ICTs could be 
used in transfusion-dependent MDS patients with life expectancy greater than two 
years. including possibly higher risk patients responding to hypomethylating 
agents.

OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to investigate life expectancy after adult cardiac 
surgery.
SETTING: Nationwide study including University and non-University hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive adult patients who underwent heart valve and coronary 
artery surgery from a nationwide administrative registry.
INTERVENTIONS: Surgical procedures on the heart valves and coronary arteries.
METHODS: The authors estimated the 10-year relative survival of adult patients 
who underwent surgery for heart valve diseases and coronary artery disease taken 
from a nationwide administrative registry.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Overall, data on 415,472 patients were available for 
this study. Among them, 394,445 (94.9%) survived 90 days after surgery, and 
their 10-year survival was 58.0% (95% CI 57.8-58.3); the expected survival was 
70.1%, and the relative survival was 0.83 (95% CI 0.82-0.83). Patients who 
underwent surgical repair of the mitral valve and aortic valve had relative 
survival of 0.96 and 0.92, respectively. Isolated coronary artery bypass 
grafting had a relative survival of 0.88. Surgical replacement of the heart 
valves had a relative survival below 0.80. Poor results with relative survival 
<0.70 were observed after complex cardiac surgery. Relative survival was <0.60 
in patients who underwent double- or triple-valve surgery combined with coronary 
artery surgery. The authors observed markedly lower relative survival among 
women (0.77, 95% CI 0.77-0.78) compared with men (0.86, 95% CI 0.85-0.86) at 10 
years. Such a difference was observed after almost all different procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provided a picture of the real expectation in 
terms of the late survival of patients after having undergone adult cardiac 
surgery. This information should be communicated to patients and their relatives 
before surgery, and it may be relevant in the decision-making process and in 
planning tertiary prevention.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and 
due to increasing life expectancy the number of patients is expected to grow. 
The diagnosis of AD involves the use of biomarkers determined by an amyloid PET 
scan or cerebrospinal fluid analyses that are either invasive or expensive, and 
not available in each hospital, thus limiting their usage as a front-line 
screener. The TearAD study aims to use tear fluid as a potential source for AD 
biomarkers. In previous reports, we demonstrated that AD biomarkers amyloid-beta 
and tau, are measurable in tear fluid and are associated with disease severity 
and neurodegeration. This study aims to validate previous results in a larger 
cohort and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of tear biomarkers to discriminate 
between individuals with and without neurodegeneration as determined by 
hippocampal atrophy.
METHODS: The TearAD study is an observational longitudinal multi-center study 
that will enroll 50 cognitively healthy controls, 50 patients with subjective 
cognitive decline, 50 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 50 patients 
with AD dementia from the memory clinic. Participants will be examined at 
baseline, after one year, and after two years follow-up. Study assessments 
include neuropsychological tests and ophthalmic examination. All participants 
will receive a MRI scan, and a subset of the study population will undergo 
cerebral spinal fluid collection and an amyloid PET scan. Tear fluid will be 
collected with Schirmer strips and levels of Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau 
in tear fluid will be determined using multiplex immunoassays. Blood samples 
will be collected from all participants. Images of the retina will be obtained 
with a standard, hyperspectral and ultra-wide field fundus camera. Additionally, 
macular pigment optical density will be measured with the macular pigment 
reflectometer, and cross-sectional images of the retina will be obtained through 
optical coherence tomography imaging.
DISCUSSION: The TearAD study will provide insight into the potential diagnostic 
use of tear biomarkers as a minimally invasive and low cost tool for the 
screening and diagnosis of AD.

Lung volume reduction for emphysema using one-way endobronchial valves: An 
Australian cohort.

Emphysema can be associated with gas trapping and hyperinflation, which 
negatively impacts on quality of life, life expectancy, and functional capacity. 
Lung volume reduction (LVR) surgery can reduce gas trapping and improve 
mortality in select patients but carries a high risk of major complications. 
Bronchoscopic techniques for LVR using one-way endobronchial valves (EBV) have 
become an established efficacious alternative to surgery. A bi-center 
retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with severe emphysema who 
underwent endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) using Pulmonx Zephyr EBVs. 
Symptomatic patients with gas-trapping and hyperinflation on lung function 
testing were selected. Target-lobe selection was based on quantitative imaging 
analysis and ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy. Successful procedures were 
determined from clinical review, imaging and follow-up testing. Thirty-nine 
patients underwent ELVR. Mean pre-procedure forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1) was 0.75 L, residual volume (RV) was 225% predicted and total lung 
capacity was 129% predicted. Most common treated-lobe was left upper lobe. 
Post-procedure pneumothorax occurred in 36.5% of patients with 73% requiring 
intercostal catheter insertion for drainage. Mean FEV1 improvement was +140 mL 
and 57% of patients achieved minimal clinical important difference FEV1 increase 
of ≥12%. Maximal mean RV change was -1010 mL with 69% of patients achieving 
minimal clinical important difference RV decrease of ≥350 mL. 
Clinician-determined success of ELVR was 78%. Procedure-related mortality was 
absent. LVR using EBVs is safe and can lead to significant improvements in lung 
function, particularly reduction of gas trapping and hyperinflation. Occurrence 
of pneumothorax post-procedure is a complication that must be monitored for and 
managed appropriately.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study estimated years of life lost (YLL) among 
US Latinx individuals during the most recent wave of drug overdose deaths.
METHODS: A serial cross-sectional study of YLL (life expectancy minus age at 
death) from death certificate records of Latinx individuals who died from drug 
overdoses from 2015 to mid-2022.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 58,209 Latinx individuals aged 15-64 years died 
from drug overdoses resulting in 2,266,784 YLL. Age-group YLL differences 
remained stable, but gender YLL trajectories diverged.
CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This study extends our understanding of 
the immense loss to Latinx communities from preventable drug deaths.

BACKGROUND: The burden of neurological disorders increases with population 
growth and aging and nearly three-quarters of the global burden of neurological 
disorders has been reported in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, this 
study aimed to report the epidemiological features and the burden of 
neurological disorders in North Africa and the Middle East (NAME) countries.
METHODS: The study population included 21 countries in the NAME region with a 
population of more than 600 million. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 
database was used. In GBD 2019, neurological disorders are classified into 7 
diseases and injuries. Incidence rates, prevalence rates, death rates, 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) rates by age-standardized rate (ASR) per 
100000 people were measured. Also, the attributed burden to high body mass index 
(BMI), high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and alcohol use were reported.
RESULTS: The highest incidence rates of neurological disorders in 2019 were in 
Iran 11293.27 (95% UI, 10132.62-12499.59) and Egypt 10257.33 (95% UI, 
9189.37-11341.16), respectively, and the highest mortality 41.12 (95% UI, 
17.68-92.44) and DALYs 1503.0 (95% UI, 853.8-2492.15) rates were in Afghanistan. 
In NAME region, the incidence and prevalence rate of neurological disorders 
increased by 0.84% (10006.37 to 10090.79) and 1.36% (33711.72 to 34170.57) 
respectively, while the mortality and DALYs rate decreased by 2.75% (34.11 to 
33.17) and 3.92% (1438.48 to 1382.14) between 1990 and 2019. The highest 
decrement of the neurological disorders-related DALYs with a 10.10% decrement 
pertained to Afghanistan (1671.86 to 1503). The highest increment of the 
neurological disorders-related DALYs with a 1.89% increment pertained to Morocco 
(1330.69 to 1355.83). The highest attributed DALYs to alcohol use pertained to 
Turkey 9.8 (95% UI, 4.23-18.05). The highest attributed DALYs to high BMI 112.23 
(95% UI, 29.3-285.75) and high fasting plasma glucose 100.36 (95% UI, 
18.79-302.85) pertained to Qatar. The highest attributed DALYs to smoking 
pertained to Lebanon 106.34 (95% UI, 37.65-253.87). Most DALYs were associated 
with those aged 75 years and more.
CONCLUSION: Despite progressive reduction in death due to neurological disorders 
in the NAME region in recent decades, there was a considerable and increasing 
number of people affected by different neurological disorders. As populations 
age, societies will face more challenges regarding prevention, detection, 
treatment, and rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: People with mental illness have a reduced life expectancy, but the 
extent of the mortality gap and the contribution of natural and unnatural causes 
to excess mortality among people with mental illness in South Africa are 
unknown.
METHODS: We analysed reimbursement claims from South African medical insurance 
scheme beneficiaries aged 15-85 years. We estimated excess life years lost (LYL) 
associated with organic, substance use, psychotic, mood, anxiety, eating, 
personality, developmental or any mental disorders.
RESULTS: We followed 1,070,183 beneficiaries for a median of three years, of 
whom 282,926 (26.4 %) received mental health diagnoses. Men with a mental health 
diagnosis lost 3.83 life years (95 % CI 3.58-4.10) compared to men without. 
Women with a mental health diagnosis lost 2.19 life years (1.97-2.41) compared 
to women without. Excess mortality varied by sex and diagnosis, from 11.50 LYL 
(95 % CI 9.79-13.07) among men with alcohol use disorder to 0.87 LYL (0.40-1.43) 
among women with generalised anxiety disorder. Most LYL were attributable to 
natural causes (men: 3.42, women: 1.94). A considerable number of LYL were 
attributable to unnatural causes among men with bipolar (1.52) or substance use 
(2.45) disorder.
LIMITATIONS: Mental diagnoses are based on reimbursement claims.
CONCLUSIONS: Premature mortality among South African individuals with mental 
disorders is high. Our findings support interventions for the prevention, early 
detection, and treatment of physical comorbidities in this population. Targeted 
programs for suicide prevention and substance use treatment, particularly among 
men, can help reduce excess mortality from unnatural causes.

Extending the indication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to 
younger and lower-risk patients naturally results in longer life expectancy and 
survival rates after the intervention. The longer life expectancy of these 
patients leads to an increased possibility of future acute coronary events, 
necessitating the development of effective and appropriate treatment strategies. 
Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients with previous TAVR procedures present 
with modified clinical characteristics when compared to the non-TAVR population. 
In populations with prior TAVR procedures, plaque rupture remains the main cause 
of ACS. However, unlike the non-TAVR population, there is an increased frequency 
of nonatherotrombotic mechanisms, like emboli and mechanical obstruction of 
coronary ostia by valve components. The main observation related to the 
treatment of ACS TAVR patients is the significantly lower percentage of patients 
undergoing invasive management. Furthermore, ACS in TAVR patients is associated 
with poor prognosis, higher long-term mortality rates, and higher incidence of 
MACE. It is surprising that considering this significant and increasingly 
recognized issue, there are only a few studies that have investigated ACS after 
TAVR. The scope of the present review is to address available data about ACS
