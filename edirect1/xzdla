PURPOSE: To compare 5-year outcomes among patients with and without unstable 
chondral lesions undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM).
METHODS: Using data from the Chondral Lesions And Meniscal Procedures (ChAMP) 
Trial, we compared outcomes for patients with unstable chondral lesions found at 
the time of APM and left in situ (CL-noDeb, N = 71) versus patients without 
unstable chondral lesions (NoCL, N = 47) at 5 years after APM. Outcomes included 
the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Knee 
Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), visual analog pain scale, 
Short-form Health Survey (SF-36), physical knee measurements, progressive joint 
space narrowing on radiographs, and the rate of additional knee surgery. 
Multivariate linear regression was used to obtain mean differences (MDs) with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age, body mass index, 
and preoperative score (for postoperative scores).
RESULTS: Compared with CL-noDeb, NoCL subjects had significantly greater 
improvement at 5 years in the KOOS score for function in sport and recreation 
(MD = 9.9 [95% CI, 0.7-19.1]), SF-36 pain (MD = 13.9 [95% CI, 5.5-22.3]), knee 
extension (MD = 0.8 [95% CI, 0.1-1.5]), and decreased quadriceps circumference 
at the mid-portion of the patella (MD = -1.5 [95% CI, -2.7 to -0.3). A greater 
proportion of patients in the NoCL group achieved the MCID for all outcome 
scores except for the WOMAC pain score (89% CL-NoDeb vs 87% NoCL) and SF-36 
general (29% CL-NoDeb vs 23% NoCL). There were no significant group differences 
in measures of progressive radiographic joint space narrowing in any 
compartments of the operative knee and no significant difference in the rate of 
additional knee surgery within 5 years of the initial APM.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing APM without unstable chondral lesions had 
statistically significantly better outcomes than patients with unstable chondral 
lesions at 5 years after surgery; however, there were no group differences in 
progressive radiographic joint space narrowing.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective comparative study.

The global spatiotemporal pattern of the COPD burden attributable to ambient 
PM2.5 is unknown in the context of the continuing increase in exposure to 
ambient PM2.5. Data on COPD burden attributable to ambient PM2.5 from 1990 to 
2019 were retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Cases and 
age-standardized rates of COPD mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life 
years (ASDR) were estimated by age, sex, region, and country. The estimated 
annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the secular trends of 
ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019. Globally, the number of COPD deaths and DALYs 
attributable to ambient PM2.5 both increased by over 90% from 1990 to 2019, but 
ASMR and ASDR both slightly decreased, with EAPC of -0.58 (95% CI: -0.72, -0.44) 
and -0.40 (95% CI: -0.51, -0.29), respectively. Most COPD deaths and DALYs 
attributable to PM2.5 occurred in the middle sociodemographic index (SDI) 
region, but the fastest growth of ASMR and ASDR occurred in the low SDI region, 
with EAPCs of 2.41 (95% CI: 2.23, 2.59) and 2.34 (95% CI: 2.16, 2.52), 
respectively. East Asia and South Asia were the high-risk areas of COPD deaths 
and DALYs attributable to PM2.5, among which China and India were the countries 
with the heaviest burden. COPD deaths and DALYs attributable to PM2.5 mainly 
occurred in individuals 70-89 years old and 60-84 years old, respectively. The 
age-specific rates of mortality and DALYs had a rapid increase in low and 
low-middle SDI regions from 1990 to 2019. The ASMR or ASDR had a reverse 
V-shaped relationship with SDI. In summary, the ambient PM2.5-attributable COPD 
burden is socioeconomic- and age-dependent, and it mediates the heterogeneity of 
spatial and temporal distribution. Low- and middle-income countries endure the 
highest ambient PM2.5-attributable COPD burden due to the high exposure to PM2.5 
and poor availability and affordability of medicines and diagnostic tests.

BACKGROUND: This study compared 7-year safety and efficacy outcomes of activL 
and ProDisc-L lumbar total disc replacements in patients with symptomatic, 
single-level lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD). The objectives are to 
report 7-year outcomes of the trial, evaluate the outcomes for patients lost to 
follow-up, and determine whether early outcomes predict long-term outcomes.
METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled 
investigational device exemption study. Eligible patients with symptomatic, 
single-level lumbar DDD had failed ≥6 months of nonsurgical management. Patients 
(N = 283) were randomized to receive activL (n = 218) or ProDisc-L (n = 65). At 
7 years, data were available from 206 patients (activL, 160; ProDisc-L, 46). 
Logistic regression models were fit to predict 7-year outcomes for patients lost 
to follow-up after 2 years.
RESULTS: At 7 years, the activL group was noninferior to the ProDisc-L group on 
the primary composite endpoint (P = .0369). Both groups showed significant 
reductions in back/leg pain severity and improvements in disability index and 
quality-of-life relative to baseline (P < .0001). In both groups, opioid use was 
significantly reduced at 7 years (0%) relative to baseline (P < .01), and the 
overall reoperation rates were low (4.6%). activL patients showed a 
significantly better range of motion (ROM) for flexion-extension rotation than 
ProDisc-L patients (P = .0334). A significantly higher proportion of activL 
patients did not report serious adverse events (activL, 62%; ProDisc-L, 43%; P = 
.011). Predictive modeling indicated that >70% of patients (depending on 
outcome) lost to follow-up after 2 years would show clinically significant 
improvement at 7 years if improvements were achieved at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of activL and ProDisc-L are maintained after 7 years, 
with significant improvements from baseline observed in pain, function, and 
opioid use. activL is more effective at preserving ROM than ProDisc-L and has a 
more favorable safety profile. Improvements in other primary and secondary 
outcomes were similar between both disc designs.

Malignant gliomas (MGs) are the most common and devastating primary brain tumor. 
At present, surgical interventions, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are only 
marginally effective in prolonging the life expectancy of patients with MGs. 
Inherent heterogeneity, aggressive invasion and infiltration, intact physical 
barriers, and the numerous mechanisms underlying chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
resistance contribute to the poor prognosis for patients with MGs. Various 
studies have investigated methods to overcome these obstacles in MG treatment. 
In this review, we address difficulties in MG treatment and focus on promising 
polymeric local drug delivery systems. In contrast to most local delivery 
systems, which are directly implanted into the residual cavity after 
intratumoral injection or the surgical removal of a tumor, some rapidly 
developing and promising nanotechnological methods-including surface-decorated 
nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, and focused ultrasound assist 
transport-are administered through (systemic) intravascular injection. We also 
discuss further synergistic and multimodal strategies for heightening 
therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we outline the challenges and therapeutic 
potential of these polymeric drug delivery systems.

The growing world population (7.8 billion) exerts an increased pressure on the 
cattle industry amongst others. Intensification and expansion of milk and beef 
production inevitably leads to increased risk of infectious disease spread and 
exacerbation. This indicates that improved understanding of cattle immune 
function is needed to provide optimal tools to combat the existing and future 
pathogens and improve food security. While dairy and beef cattle production is 
easily the world's most important agricultural industry, there are few current 
comprehensive reviews of bovine immunobiology. High-yielding dairy cattle and 
their calves are more vulnerable to various diseases leading to shorter life 
expectancy and reduced environmental fitness. In this manuscript, we seek to 
fill this paucity of knowledge and provide an up-to-date overview of immune 
function in cattle emphasizing the unresolved challenges and most urgent needs 
in rearing dairy calves. We will also discuss how the combination of available 
preventative and treatment strategies and herd management practices can maintain 
optimal health in dairy cows during the transition (periparturient) period and 
in neonatal calves.

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in medical care have increased life expectancy and 
improved the quality of life for people with Down syndrome (DS). These advances 
are the result of both pre-clinical and clinical research but much about DS is 
still poorly understood. In 2020, the NIH announced their plan to update their 
DS research plan and requested input from the scientific and advocacy community.
OBJECTIVE: The National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) and the LuMind IDSC 
Foundation worked together with scientific and medical experts to develop 
recommendations for the NIH research plan.
METHODS: NDSS and LuMind IDSC assembled over 50 experts across multiple 
disciplines and organized them in eleven working groups focused on specific 
issues for people with DS.
RESULTS: This review article summarizes the research gaps and recommendations 
that have the potential to improve the health and quality of life for people 
with DS within the next decade.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights many of the scientific gaps that exist in DS 
research. Based on these gaps, a multidisciplinary group of DS experts has made 
recommendations to advance DS research. This paper may also aid policymakers and 
the DS community to build a comprehensive national DS research strategy.

Take-off is a critical phase of flight, and many birds jump to take to the air. 
Although the actuation of the hindlimb in terrestrial birds is not limited to 
the sagittal plane, and considerable non-sagittal plane motion has been observed 
during take-off jumps, how the spatial arrangement of hindlimb muscles in flying 
birds facilitates such jumps has received little attention. This study aims to 
ascertain the 3D hip muscle function in the magpie (Pica pica), a bird known to 
jump to take-off. A musculoskeletal model of the magpie hindlimb was developed 
using μCT scans (isotropic resolution of 18.2 μm) to derive bone surfaces, while 
the 3D muscle path definition was further informed by the literature. Function 
was robustly characterized by determining the 3D moment-generating capacity of 
14 hip muscles over the functional joint range of motion during a take-off leap 
considering variations across the attachment areas and uncertainty in dynamic 
muscle geometry. Ratios of peak flexion-extension (FE) to internal-external 
rotation (IER) and abduction-adduction (ABD) moment-generating capacity were 
indicators of muscle function. Analyses of 972 variations of the 3D muscle paths 
showed that 11 of 14 muscles can act as either flexor or extensor, while all 14 
muscles demonstrated the capacity to act as internal or external rotators of the 
hip with the mean ratios of peak FE to IER and ABD moment-generating capacity 
were 0.89 and 0.31, respectively. Moment-generating capacity in IER approaching 
levels in the FE moment-generating capacity determined here underline that the 
avian hip muscle function is not limited to the sagittal plane. Together with 
previous findings on the 3D nature of hindlimb kinematics, our results suggest 
that musculoskeletal models to develop a more detailed understanding of how 
birds orchestrate the use of muscles during a take-off jump cannot be restricted 
to the sagittal plane.

Particulate matters with an aerodynamic diameter ≤1 μm (PM1) significantly 
increased mortality risk, and the effect of PM1 was even greater than that of 
PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm). But the quantitative impact of PM1 on life 
expectancy was unknown. We aim to examine the extent to which that people's life 
expectancy was shortened by PM1 and PM2.5. We obtained daily data on deaths, PM1 
and PM2.5 records, and weather variables during 2016-2017 in Nanjing, China. 
Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated by matching each decedent's age and 
sex to the Chinese life table. The fitted nonlinear dose-response associations 
of YLLs with PM1 and PM2.5 were estimated by utilizing a generalized additive 
model with a Gaussian link that controlled for confounding factors including 
meteorological variables, day of week, and long-term trend and seasonality. The 
effect estimates were presented as the YLLs when PM1 and PM2.5 concentrations 
fell in different ranges. Life expectancy losses attributable to PM1 and PM2.5 
were calculated. Stratified analyses were also performed by age, sex, and death 
causes. Significant PM-YLL associations were observed, with greater increases in 
YLLs associated with PM1 (68.9 thousand). PM1 was estimated to reduce life 
expectancy, which was greater than PM2.5 (PM1: 1.67 years; PM2.5: 1.55 years). 
For PM1, greater years of loss in PM-related life expectancy were found in the 
female group, ≥65 years group, and cardiovascular disease group. Exposure to PM1 
had a greater impact on life expectancy loss than did PM2.5. Constant efforts 
are urgently needed to control PM1 air pollution to improve people's longevity.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension grows into a serious public health problem among young 
adults, linking to a set of life-threatening cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). 
Young adults are not well represented in current knowledge about the CVDs burden 
attributable to hypertension.
METHODS: In this analysis of data from the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) study 
2019, we focus on young adults and provide the first comprehensive and 
comparative assessment of the hypertension attributable CVDs burden, in terms of 
its mortality and years of living with disability (YLD) from 1990 to 2019, 
stratified by location, sex, and development status.
RESULTS: Globally in 2019, the death and YLD numbers caused by 
hypertension-related CVDs were 640 239 and 2 717 474 in young adults, marking a 
43.0 and 86.6% increase from 1990, respectively. The corresponding mortality 
rate dropped by 10.5%, whereas the YLD rate increased by 16.8% during the same 
period. V-shaped association between CVDs burden and social development status 
was observed. The largest burden and the most pronounced increase were borne by 
middle-income countries, while high-income countries had the lowest death/YLD 
rate with a quicker annual decline. Men largely outpaced women in hypertension 
attributable CVDs mortality. Ischemic heart disease and stroke were the leading 
cause for death and YLD burden, correspondingly.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension attributable CVDs burden in young adults has greatly 
increased from 1990 to 2019, with considerably spatiotemporal and sexual 
heterogeneity. The largest burden was borne by middle-income countries, 
especially by men. Establishment of geographically and sexually tailored 
strategies were needed to prevent hypertension-related CVDs in young adults.

AIMS: This study determined whether the improvements in hypertension management 
over the last five decades have influenced subjects' prognosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study considered 5693 eligible subjects seen January 
1969 to February 1991 (follow-up until December 2003) or January 1995 to October 
2014 (follow-up until July 2016) in an all-grade hypertension reference centre. 
Missing data or incomplete follow-ups led to exclude 1036 subjects (18%). The 
outcome was all-cause death. An adjusted modelling of the excess mortality rate 
assessed subjects' net survival over five inclusion periods to allow for the 
increase in life expectancy of the general population during the same periods. 
The analysis of 4657 records (mean age: 47 years; 43.2% women) showed that the 
proportion of subjects with grade 3 hypertension decreased significantly from 
43.3% (1142) to only 6.3% (22) over the five periods and that the net survival 
improved in men and women regardless of the hypertension grade; i.e. the gain in 
net survival at 15 years was estimated at 12.3% (95% confidence interval: 
8.1-22.3). The 15-year restricted mean survival was estimated at 13 years over 
the first period and 14.8 years over the last period, which is nearly a 2-year 
gain in life expectancy at 15 years.
CONCLUSION: Since the 70s and the advent of modern management, the excess 
mortality of hypertensive subjects (vs. the general population) was markedly 
reduced. Within a context of trivialization of blood pressure measurement and 
reluctance to long-term treatments, physicians should consider this advantage 
and use it to promote blood pressure control.

Design and Validation of a Self-Aligning Index Finger Exoskeleton for 
Post-Stroke Rehabilitation.

Sun N, Li G, Cheng L.

Rehabilitation of hand functions is necessary to improve post-stroke patients' 
quality of life. There is initial evidence that hand exoskeletons should 
exercise flexion/extension (f/e) and abduction/adduction (a/a) of the fingers to 
rebuild hand functions. However, designing a self-alignment mechanism of the 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint to improve its wearing comfort is still a 
challenge. In this paper, a novel index finger exoskeleton with three motors is 
proposed to help post-stroke patients perform finger a/a and f/e training. A 
spatial mechanism with passive degrees of freedom for the MCP joint is designed 
to realize human-robot axes self-alignment. The proposed mechanism's kinematic 
compatibility is analyzed to show its self-aligning capability, and the 
kineto-statics analysis is performed to present the exoskeleton's static 
characteristics. Finally, kinematic and static experiments have been conducted, 
and the results indicate that the standardized reaction forces square sum of the 
exoskeleton to the MCP joint can be reduced by 65.8% compared with the 
state-of-the-art exoskeleton. According to the experimental results, the 
exoskeleton can achieve the a/a and f/e training and human-robot axes 
self-alignment, and improve its comfortability. In the future, clinical trials 
will be further studied to test the exoskeleton.

The Feel4Diabetes-study implemented a school- and community-based intervention 
to promote healthy lifestyle and prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in six 
European countries. The intervention included a special focus on families at 
increased T2DM risk. The current study evaluates the intervention's 
cost-effectiveness. A Markov-type health economic model was developed to predict 
the incidence of T2DM and its complications. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (lifetime horizon, societal perspective) were calculated based on the 
overall intervention effect on health behaviour, and stratified for low- and 
high-risk families. Sensitivity analyses captured input parameters uncertainty. 
A budget impact analysis was performed. The increase in children's water 
consumption and physical activity led to a modest gain in quality adjusted life 
years (QALYs) at a low intervention cost and budget impact. Medical cost savings 
due to avoided illness could only be achieved on the very long-term (>30 years). 
The intervention in its entirety was cost-effective (more QALYs at a reasonable 
investment) in Belgium, Finland, Bulgaria, and Hungary, while being dominant 
(net savings and more QALYs) in Greece and Spain. Results were cost-effective 
for the low-risk families, who only received the school- and community-based 
intervention component. Results for the high-risk families were only 
cost-effective (with considerable uncertainty) in Greece and Spain, but not when 
the intervention would need to be repeated. The Feel4Diabetes-intervention is 
potentially cost-effective, especially in countries with a high overweight and 
obesity prevalence, at a limited budget impact. The incremental financial 
investments to reach and support high-risk families did not result in the 
hoped-for health benefits.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to measure the impact of innovative pelvic 
floor muscle training (iPFMT) on Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in women 
with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treated by duloxetine.
STUDY DESIGN: This analysis is part of the DULOXING study conducted between 
February 2019 and 2020. The control group received oral duloxetine treatment 
(40 mg BID), and the experimental group received oral duloxetine treatment 
(40 mg BID) and iPFMT with lumbopelvic stabilization. SUI was analysed at 
baseline and in the final period according to the International Consultation on 
Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF). The 
QALYs gained were calculated by multiplying life expectancy (LE) by a weighting 
factor (QALYs = LE * WF).
RESULTS: The study included 158 women, of whom 129 were fully analysed (81.6%). 
The mean life expectancy was 26.3 ± 11.8 years for the control group and 
29.0 ± 11.7 years for the experimental group. The mean baseline ICIQ-UI SF 
scores were 15.2 ± 1.7 vs 15.1 ± 1.5, and the final ICIQ-UI SF scores were 
9.8 ± 4.2 vs 8.3 ± 3.8, in the control vs the experimental group, respectively 
(p < 0.05). The mean baseline WF was 0.27 ± 0.08 vs 0.28 ± 0.07, and the final 
WF was 0.53 ± 0.20 vs 0.60 ± 0.18, in the control vs the experimental group, 
respectively (p < 0.05). Before treatment, the number of QALYs during life 
expectancy in the control vs the experimental group was 7.53 ± 4.24 vs 
8.30 ± 4.01. The number of QALYs during life expectancy in control vs the 
experimental group increased following treatment: 15.03 ± 7.63 vs 17.90 ± 7.86 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Combination treatment with duloxetine and iPFMT statistically 
significantly increased the number of QALYs and reduced the degree of urinary 
incontinence in women with stress urinary incontinence.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the Fetal Medicine Foundation 
(FMF) combined first-trimester pre-eclampsia (PE) screening algorithm, coupled 
with low-dose aspirin treatment in high-risk patients, compared to the standard 
of care (SOC; screening based on maternal risk factors) for nulliparous 
pregnancies in Belgium.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic model was used to estimate the costs and 
outcomes for patients screened using the SOC and for those using the FMF 
screening algorithm, from the Belgian payers' perspective. Where possible, the 
probabilities and associated costs at each decision point were calculated based 
on published literature and public databases.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was assessed using an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess 
the impact of independent variations in each model parameter. A probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the impact of the overall uncertainty 
of the model on the estimated cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Considering an estimated 51,309 pregnancies in nulliparous women in 
Belgium per year, the FMF screening algorithm resulted in fewer cases of 
pre-term PE compared with the SOC (479 versus 816 cases) and a cost saving of 
€28.67 per patient. The outcome in quality-adjusted life-years was similar for 
both screening approaches (FMF screening algorithm 1.8521 versus SOC 1.8518). 
The FMF screening algorithm was cost-saving and more effective in 99.4% of 
simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: The FMF screening algorithm coupled with early intervention using 
low-dose aspirin has the potential to prevent an additional 337 cases of 
pre-term PE per year compared with the current SOC in this population, along 
with a cost saving.

BACKGROUND: Antithrombotics are frequently prescribed for patients with a 
limited life expectancy. In the last phase of life, when treatment is primarily 
focused on optimizing patients' quality of life, the use of antithrombotics 
should be reconsidered.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective review of 180 
medical records of patients who had died of a malignant or non-malignant 
disease, at home, in a hospice or in a hospital, in the Netherlands. All 
medication prescriptions and clinical notes of patients using antithrombotics in 
the last three months of life were reviewed manually. We subsequently developed 
case vignettes based on a purposive sample, with variation in setting, age, 
gender, type of medication, and underlying disease.
RESULTS: In total 60% (n=108) of patients had used antithrombotics in the last 
three months of life. Of all patients using antithrombotics 33.3 % died at home, 
21.3 % in a hospice and 45.4 % in a hospital. In total, 157 antithrombotic 
prescriptions were registered; 30 prescriptions of vitamin K antagonists, 60 of 
heparins, and 66 of platelet aggregation inhibitors. Of 51 patients using 
heparins, 32 only received a prophylactic dose. In 75.9 % of patients 
antithrombotics were continued until the last week before death. Case vignettes 
suggest that inability to swallow, bleeding complications or the dying phase 
were important factors in making decisions about the use of antithrombotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Antithrombotics in patients with a life limiting disease are often 
continued until shortly before death. Clinical guidance may support physicians 
to reconsider (dis)continuation of antithrombotics and discuss this with the 
patient.

INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy improves globally, the burden of elderly trauma 
continues to increase. Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to have the most rapid 
growth in its elderly demographic. Consequently, we sought to examine the trends 
in characteristics and outcomes of elderly trauma in a tertiary care hospital in 
Malawi.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients in the trauma 
registry at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Lilongwe, Malawi from 2011-2017. 
Patients were categorized into elderly (≥ 65 years) and non-elderly (18-64 
years). Bivariate analysis compared the characteristics and outcomes of elderly 
vs. non-elderly patients. The elderly population was then examined over the 
study period. Poisson regression modeling was used to determine the risk of 
mortality among elderly patients over time.
RESULTS: Of 63,699 adult trauma patients, 1,925 (3.0%) were aged ≥ 65 years. 
Among the elderly, the most common mechanism of injury was falls (n = 725 
[37.7%]) whereas vehicle or bike collisions were more common in the non-elderly 
(n = 15,967 [25.9%]). Fractures and dislocations were more prevalent in the 
elderly (n = 808 [42.0%] vs. 9,133 [14.8%], p < 0.001). In-hospital crude 
mortality for the elderly was double the non-elderly group (4.8% vs. 2.4%, p < 
0.001). Elderly transfers, surgeries, and length of stay significantly increased 
over the study period but mortality remained relatively unchanged. When adjusted 
for injury severity and transfer status, there was no significant difference in 
risk of in-hospital mortality over time.
CONCLUSION: At KCH, the proportion of elderly trauma patients is slowly 
increasing. Although healthcare resource utilization has increased over time,
