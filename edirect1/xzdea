INTRODUCTION: The aim was to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of the 
Dexcom G6 real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) system versus 
self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 
France.
METHODS: The analysis was performed using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model and 
utilized clinical input data from the DIAMOND clinical trial in adults with T1D. 
Simulated patients were assumed to have a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%, and those 
in the RT-CGM arm were assumed to have a HbA1c reduction of 1.0% compared with 
0.4% in the SMBG arm. A quality of life (QoL) benefit associated with a reduced 
fear of hypoglycemia (FoH) and elimination of the requirement for fingerstick 
testing in the RT-CGM arm was also applied.
RESULTS: The G6 RT-CGM system was associated with an incremental gain in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.38 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
compared with SMBG (10.64 QALYs versus 9.23 QALYs). Total mean lifetime costs 
were 21,087 euros higher with RT-CGM (148,077 euros versus 126,990 euros), 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 15,285 euros per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In France, based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 euros 
per QALY gained, the use of the G6 RT-CGM system is cost-effective relative to 
SMBG for adults with long-standing T1D, driven primarily by improved glycemic 
control and the QoL benefit associated with reduced FoH and elimination of the 
requirement for fingerstick testing.

Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare premature aging disease, most commonly caused 
by mutations of the genes encoding the CSA or CSB proteins. CS patients display 
cachectic dwarfism and severe neurological manifestations and have an average 
life expectancy of 12 years. The CS proteins are involved in transcription and 
DNA repair, with the latter including transcription-coupled nucleotide excision 
repair (TC-NER). However, there is also evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction 
in CS, which likely contributes to the severe premature aging phenotype of this 
disease. While damaged mitochondria and impaired mitophagy were characterized in 
mice with CSB deficiency, such changes in the CS nematode model and CS patients 
are not fully known. Our cross-species transcriptomic analysis in CS postmortem 
brain tissue, CS mouse, and nematode models shows that mitochondrial dysfunction 
is indeed a common feature in CS. Restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction 
through NAD+ supplementation significantly improved lifespan and healthspan in 
the CS nematodes, highlighting mitochondrial dysfunction as a major driver of 
the aging features of CS. In cerebellar samples from CS patients, we found 
molecular signatures of dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics and impaired 
mitophagy/autophagy. In primary cells depleted for CSA or CSB, this dysfunction 
can be corrected with supplementation of NAD+ precursors. Our study provides 
support for the interconnection between major causative aging theories, DNA 
damage accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and compromised 
mitophagy/autophagy. Together, these three agents contribute to an accelerated 
aging program that can be averted by cellular NAD+ restoration.

End-of-Life Care: Serious Illness Progression, Prognostication, and Advance Care 
Planning.

Because of their longstanding relationships with patients, family physicians 
often are in the best position to identify signs of serious illness progression, 
provide support and guidance to patients and caregivers, and tailor care plans 
to individual needs and preferences at the end of life. Significant signs of 
illness progression include worsening of one or more conditions, decline in 
function, and increase in the number of emergency department visits or 
hospitalizations. Prognostication refers to estimation of the remaining life 
expectancy. Several tools are available to inform such estimates. 
Prognostication should include discussion of the expected illness progression to 
help patients and family members prepare, plan, and cope. Advance care planning, 
ideally started before or early in the course of illness, should include 
identification of patient surrogate decision-makers as well as a discussion of 
patient values, priorities, and care preferences. Planning should continue and 
evolve to inform care plans that match patient and family member priorities at 
each stage of illness. Family physicians should be familiar with resources 
available in their communities to support care plans, including palliative care 
subspecialists, home- and facility-based palliative care teams, and hospice 
physicians.

Hospice care consists of palliative care provided at the end of life that 
provides comprehensive comfort care for patients and support for family members. 
This includes medical care, pain management, and emotional and spiritual support 
tailored to patient needs and wishes. Eligibility rules require a physician to 
determine that the prognosis for the patient involves an estimated life 
expectancy of 6 months or less if the illness runs its expected course. Family 
physicians can be key partners in helping patients and family members transition 
when hospice care best matches patient goals. Hospice care is delivered by an 
interdisciplinary team, including family physicians, physician medical 
directors, nurses, social workers, counselors, home health aides, and trained 
volunteers. Although most hospice care is delivered in the home of the patient, 
it also may be provided in long-term care facilities, hospice facilities, and in 
the hospital when needed for symptom control. Hospice care has been associated 
with better symptom relief, better achievement of patient end-of-life wishes, 
and higher overall rating of quality of end-of-life care compared with standard 
care. Family physicians have the ideal skills to manage and coordinate patient 
hospice care needs.

CONTEXT: Hospice is a service for those with a life expectancy of six months or 
less. Family caregivers suffer from depression and anxiety as they care for 
their loved one until they die. Little is known about how research participants 
decide to consent to participate in clinical trials in the hospice setting.
OBJECTIVES: This pilot study sought to answer two research questions: 1) In what 
way do demographic characteristics, mental health, and perceived caregiving 
experience impact the decision by caregivers to participate in hospice clinical 
trials? 2) In what ways do the perceived physical, psychological, economic, 
familial, and social dimensions of caregivers' lives influence their decision to 
participate in hospice clinical trials?
METHODS: The characteristics and stated reasons for consent of hospice 
caregivers participating in a clinical trial were compared with individuals who 
refused clinical trial consent and only consented to this pilot study. 
Demographic, mental health, and perceptions of caregiving experience were 
measured as influencers to the consent decision. Recruitment calls were recorded 
and coded using framework analysis to identify perceived benefits and burdens 
impacting the decision to consent to the clinical trial.
RESULTS: Overall, trial participants were more often adult children to the 
patient (55% vs. 21%, P = 0.005), younger (56 vs. 63 years, P = 0.04), and 
employed (47% vs. 24%, P = 0.02) as compared with those who did not consent to 
participate in the trial. Reported levels of depression, anxiety, and quality of 
life were not significantly different between those who chose to participate in 
the clinical trial and those who participated only in this pilot study; however, 
caregiver burden was higher for those consenting to the clinical trial (4.05 vs. 
7.16, P < 0.0001). Perceived benefits expressed by both groups were largely 
psychological as participants felt positive about contributing to science. 
Burdens expressed by both groups were predominately physical as they related to 
hesitation to participate in the intervention because of technology or the 
burdens of caregiving.
CONCLUSION: The benefits and burdens model for clinical trial participation is 
applicable to the caregiver experience in the hospice setting. Understanding the 
perceptions and dimensions of benefits and burdens to potential study 
participants is critical to not only the intervention design but also the 
tailoring of recruitment contacts and informed consent process.

Reconstruction of wide skull base defects resulting from multimodal treatment of 
cranial base malignancies are challenging.1 Endonasal pedicled flaps (e.g., 
Hadad-Bassagusteguy flap)1,2 are generally the first choice; however, inadequacy 
for the size and location of the defect or their unavailability are common 
occurrences in salvage reconstructions, and prior irradiation is an additional 
unfavorable condition for local flap viability. The temporoparietal fascia flap 
(TPFF)3 is a regional flap vascularized by the superficial temporal artery, 
which is able to survive and integrate even in postirradiated areas. Its 
properties, such as thinness, pliability, foldability, and the long pedicle, 
make it a versatile flap for reconstruction of various defects of the skull 
base, both in adults3-7 and children.8 In lateral skull surgery, TPFF proved to 
be effective in patients at higher risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak,7 whereas 
its transposition into the nasal cavity through a temporal-infratemporal tunnel 
has been widely reported to repair defects of the ventral skull base.3-6 It 
represents a safe and effective technique with minimal additional morbidity 
(potential alopecia or scalp necrosis).4,5 A recently described modification of 
this technique supports TPFF transposition via a supraorbital epidural corridor 
to reach the anterior skull base, especially for large defects with supraorbital 
extension.6 The present video (Video 1) shows the step-by-step TPFF harvesting 
and endonasal transposition via a temporal-infratemporal tunnel to repair a wide 
middle cranial fossa defect resulting from osteoradionecrosis after endoscopic 
resection and heavy-particle radiation therapy for sinonasal adenoid-cystic 
carcinoma. At 6-months follow-up, optimal healing without complications was 
observed.

Aging is a major risk factor for human diseases. As global average life 
expectancy has lengthened, delaying or reducing aging and age-related diseases 
has become an urgent issue for improving the quality of life. The vascular aging 
process represents an important link between aging and age-related diseases. 
Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EV) that can be secreted by almost 
all eukaryotic cells, and they deliver characteristic biological information 
about donor cells to regulate the cellular microenvironment, mediate signal 
transmission between neighboring or distant cells, and affect the expression of 
target genes in recipient cells. Many recent studies have shown that exosomal 
microribonucleic acids (miRNA) are involved in the regulation of vascular aging 
by participating in the physiological functions of vascular cells and the 
destruction and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This review 
summarizes the regulatory functions of exosomal miRNA in vascular aging because 
they interact with the ECM, and participate in vascular cell senescence, and the 
regulation of senescence-related functions such as proliferation, migration, 
apoptosis, inflammation, and differentiation.

A packaging system using gaseous chlorine dioxide generating film (CDGF) in a 
sealed container was developed to extend the shelf life of semi-dry longan pulp 
(moisture content 38.8 wt%; aw0.8). The antimicrobial properties, formation of 
chloroxyanion residues and effects of CDGF on the quality of semi-dry longan 
pulp were investigated. CDGF was triggered by the moisture vapor from semi-dry 
longan pulp in the sealed container and released gaseous ClO2 into the headspace 
of the container. The antifungal test showed that CDGF significantly inactivated 
artificially inoculated molds in semi-dry longan pulp and achieved reductions of 
over 3 log CFU/g after 28 days storage at room temperature (25 °C). CDGF reduced 
total aerobic bacterial populations by over 6.4 log CFU/g and maintained these 
population levels at around 2.0 log CFU/g throughout the 180-day storage period 
at room temperature. The residual concentrations of chloride, chlorate and 
perchlorate in longan pulp increased and then decreased during the 180-day 
storage. Residual chloride levels were maintained at 1.5 mg/g after Day 120 and 
residual chlorate and perchlorate levels were not detected after Day 120 and Day 
180, respectively, in CDGF-treated samples. CDGF treatments reduced total 
polyphenol content but didn't have any significant impact on the levels of 
polysaccharides in samples. There were no significant differences between 
CDGF-treated and control samples in color changes during storage. The content of 
5-hydroymethylfurfural (5-HMF) in both samples increased during storage, 
suggesting that the Maillard reaction occurred. This study demonstrated an 
effective approach to develop a new antimicrobial packaging system for semi-dry 
longan pulp.

Aquatic products are extremely perishable due to their biological composition. 
Conventional preservation methods such as freezing, chemical treatments, 
packaging, and so forth are unable to inhibit enzymatic and microbiological 
spoilage efficiently and/or energy intensive and/or potentially toxic. However, 
the demand of consumers for aquatic products with long shelf life and high 
quality has urged the food industries to pursuit highly effective preservation 
methods for shelf life extension of aquatic products. Nanotechnology-related 
shelf life prolongation process possess the ability to overcome the drawbacks of 
conventional preservation technologies due to its unique properties. In this 
article, the aquatic products spoilage mechanisms, recent application of 
nanotechnology-related preservation techniques for aquatic products as well as 
the risk and regulation of nanomaterials have been reviewed. It has been shown 
that nanotechnology-related preservation techniques can effectively extend the 
shelf life without impairing the quality of aquatic products. However, the 
safety of nanotechnology is still remained controversial, therefore, the 
application of nanotechnology should be considered cautiously.

Introduction: Thanks to antiretroviral therapy (ART), persons living with HIV 
(PLWH), have a longer life expectancy. However, immune activation and 
inflammation remain elevated, even after viral suppression, and contribute to 
morbidity and mortality in these individuals.Areas covered: We review aspects 
related to immune activation and inflammation in PLWH, their consequences, and 
the potential strategies to reduce immune activation in HIV-infected individuals 
on ART.Expert opinion: When addressing a problem, it is necessary to thoroughly 
understand the topic. This is the main limitation faced when dealing with immune 
activation and inflammation in PLWH since there is no consensus on the ideal 
markers to evaluate immune activation or inflammation. To date, the different 
interventions that have addressed this problem by targeting specific mediators 
have not been able to significantly reduce immune activation or its 
consequences. Given that there is currently no curative intervention for HIV 
infection, more studies are necessary to understand the mechanism underlying 
immune activation and help to identify potential therapeutic targets that 
contribute to improving the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals.

A large decrease in the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations in mortality among 
elderly explains part of the increase in longevity in Sweden during 20th 
century.

BACKGROUND: Mortality rates are known to depend on the seasons and, in temperate 
climates, rates are highest during winter. The magnitude of these seasonal 
fluctuations in mortality has decreased substantially in many countries during 
the 20th century, but the extent to which this decrease has contributed to the 
concurrent increase in life expectancy is not known. Here, I describe how the 
seasonality of all-cause mortality among people ages 60 years or more has 
changed in Sweden between 1860 and 1995, and investigate how this change has 
contributed to the increase in life expectancy observed during the same time 
period.
METHODS: Yearly sex-specific birth cohorts consisting of all people born in 
Sweden between 1800 and 1901 who reached at least 59 years of age were obtained 
from a genealogical database. The mortality rates for each cohort were modeled 
by an exponential function of age modulated by a sinusoidal function of time of 
year. The potential impact of seasonal fluctuations on life expectancy was 
investigated by a novel decomposition of the total mortality rate into a 
seasonal part and a part independent of the seasons. Cohort life expectancy at 
age 60 was used to quantify changes in lifespan during the time period.
RESULTS: The magnitude of seasonal fluctuations in mortality rates decreased 
substantially between 1860 and 1995. For cohorts born in 1800, the risk of dying 
during the winter season was almost twice that of dying during summer. For 
cohorts born in 1900, the relative increase in winter mortality was 10%. Cohort 
life expectancy at age 60 increased by 4.3 years for men and 6.8 years for 
women, and the decrease in seasonal mortality fluctuations accounted for 
approximately 40% of this increase in average lifespan.
CONCLUSION: By following a large number of extinct cohorts, it was possible to 
show how the decrease in seasonal fluctuations in mortality has contributed to 
an increase in life expectancy. The decomposition of total mortality introduced 
here might be useful to better understand the processes and mechanisms 
underlying the marked improvements in life expectancy seen over the last 150 
years.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus infection is the leading cause of 
bronchiolitis in Colombia. There is growing evidence about the impact of 
Respiratory syncytial virus on society in terms of years of life lost due to 
this condition. The objective of the present study is to determine the 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years for respiratory syncytial virus in children under 
2 years in Colombia.
METHODS: Data from the national epidemiological surveillance system were used to 
estimate DALYs, calculated from the sum of years of life lost and years lived 
with disability due to RSV infection in Colombia. A bootstrapped method with 
10,000 iterations was used to estimate each statistical parameter using the 
package DALY calculator in R.
RESULTS: In 2019, 260,873 years of life (CI95% 208,180-347,023) were lost due to 
RSV bronchiolitis in Colombian children under 2 years. The estimated rate was 20 
DALYs / 1000 person-year (95% CI 16-27).
CONCLUSION: This is the first report estimating the impact of RSV bronchiolitis 
morbidity and mortality in Colombia. The findings of the present study suggest 
that the actual burden and cost of bronchiolitis due to RSV is high. Prevention

BACKGROUND: The evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of nonoperative 
management is growing. However, the best treatment strategy for acute 
complicated appendicitis remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies for complicated appendicitis 
patients. This study sought to determine the most cost-effective strategy from 
the health care-payer's perspective.
METHODS: The primary outcome was an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
using nonoperative management with or without interval laparoscopic appendectomy 
(ILA) as the intervention compared with operative management with emergency 
laparoscopic appendectomy (ELA) alone as the control. Model variables were 
abstracted from a literature review, and from data obtained from the hospital 
records of Tochigi Medical Center. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using an 
ICER. We constructed a Markov model to compare treatment strategies for 
complicated appendicitis in otherwise-healthy adults, over a time horizon of a 
single year. Uncertainty surrounding model parameters was assessed via one-way- 
and probabilistic-sensitivity analyses. Threshold analysis was performed using 
the willingness-to-pay threshold set at the World Health Organization's 
criterion of $107,690.
RESULTS: Three meta-analysis were included in our analysis. Operative management 
cost $6075 per patient. Nonoperative management with interval laparoscopic 
appendectomy (ILA) cost $984 more than operative management and produced only 
0.005 more QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $182,587. Nonoperative management 
without ILA cost $235 more than operative management, and also yielded only 
0.005 additional QALYs resulting in an ICER of $45,123 per QALY. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis with 1000 draws resulted in average ICER of $172,992 in 
nonoperative management with ILA and $462,843 in Nonoperative management without 
ILA. The threshold analysis demonstrated that regardless of willingness-to-pay, 
nonoperative management without ILA would not be most cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonoperative management with ILA and Nonoperative management 
without ILA were not cost-effective strategies compared with operative 
management to treat complicated appendicitis. Based on our findings, operative 
management remains the standard of care and nonoperative management would be 
reconsidered as a treatment option in complicated appendicitis from economic 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: While in general a country's life expectancy increases with national 
income, some countries "punch above their weight", while some "punch below their 
weight" - achieving higher or lower life expectancy than would be predicted by 
their per capita income. Discovering which conditions or policies contribute to 
this outcome is critical to improving population health globally.
METHODS: We conducted a mixed-method study which included: analysis of life 
expectancy relative to income for all countries; an expert opinion study; and 
scoping reviews of literature and data to examine factors that may impact on 
life expectancy relative to income in three countries: Ethiopia, Brazil, and the 
United States. Punching above or below weight status was calculated using life 
expectancy at birth and gross domestic product per capita for 2014-2018. The 
scoping reviews covered the political context and history, social determinants 
of health, civil society, and political participation in each country.
RESULTS: Possible drivers identified for Ethiopia's extra 3 years life 
expectancy included community-based health strategies, improving access to safe 
water, female education and gender empowerment, and the rise of civil society 
organisations. Brazil punched above its weight by 2 years. Possible drivers 
identified included socio-political and economic improvements, reduced 
inequality, female education, health care coverage, civil society, and political 
participation. The United States' neoliberal economics and limited social 
security, market-based healthcare, limited public health regulation, weak social 
safety net, significant increases in income inequality and lower levels of 
political participation may have contributed to the country punching 2.9 years 
below weight.
CONCLUSIONS: The review highlighted potential structural determinants driving 
differential performance in population health outcomes cross-nationally. These 
included greater equity, a more inclusive welfare system, high political 
participation, strong civil society and access to employment, housing, safe 
water, a clean environment, and education. We recommend research comparing more 
countries, and also to examine the processes driving within-country inequities.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is largely linked to deletion or mutation of the 
Survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene located on chromosome 5q13. Type III 
(Kugelberg-Welander disease) is the mildest childhood form and patients may 
become ambulatory and have a normal life expectancy. We report the clinical 
history and morphological findings of a 55-year-old woman who began to 
experience motor problems at the age of two. She was never fully ambulatory, and 
her severe scoliosis required the insertion of surgical rod at age 19. 
Unexpectedly, around 35 years of age, she began to experience sensory symptoms 
best characterized as a myelo-radiculo-neuropathy with pain as the dominant 
symptom. Investigations never clarified the etiology of these symptoms. 
Molecular confirmation of SMA type III was done post-mortem. Neuropathological 
examination showed classic changes of lower motor neuron neurodegeneration, in 
line with those reported in the single molecularly confirmed case published so 
far, and with findings in rare cases reported prior to the discovery of the gene 
defect. A key autopsy finding was the presence of a severe superficial siderosis 
of the lower half of the spinal cord. In recent years, the concept of duropathy 
was put forward, associating superficial siderosis of the spinal cord with 
various spinal abnormalities, some of which were present in our patient. The 
presence of significant hemosiderin deposits in the spinal cord and sensory 
nerve roots with associated tissue and axonal damage provide a plausible 
explanation for the unexpected sensory symptomatology in this mild lower motor 
neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with schizophrenia are at higher risk of physical 
illnesses, which are a major contributor to their 20-year reduced life 
expectancy. It is currently unknown what causes the increased risk of physical 
illness in schizophrenia.
AIMS: To link genetic data from a clinically ascertained sample of individuals 
with schizophrenia to anonymised National Health Service (NHS) records. To 
assess (a) rates of physical illness in those with schizophrenia, and (b) 
whether physical illness in schizophrenia is associated with genetic liability.
METHOD: We linked genetic data from a clinically ascertained sample of 
individuals with schizophrenia (Cardiff Cognition in Schizophrenia participants, 
n = 896) to anonymised NHS records held in the Secure Anonymised Information 
Linkage (SAIL) databank. Physical illnesses were defined from the General 
Practice Database and Patient Episode Database for Wales. Genetic liability for 
schizophrenia was indexed by (a) rare copy number variants (CNVs), and (b) 
polygenic risk scores.
RESULTS: Individuals with schizophrenia in SAIL had increased rates of epilepsy 
(standardised rate ratio (SRR) = 5.34), intellectual disability (SRR = 3.11), 
type 2 diabetes (SRR = 2.45), congenital disorders (SRR = 1.77), ischaemic heart 
disease (SRR = 1.57) and smoking (SRR = 1.44) in comparison with the general 
SAIL population. In those with schizophrenia, carrier status for 
schizophrenia-associated CNVs and neurodevelopmental disorder-associated CNVs 
was associated with height (P = 0.015-0.017), with carriers being 7.5-7.7 cm 
shorter than non-carriers. We did not find evidence that the increased rates of 
poor physical health outcomes in schizophrenia were associated with genetic 
liability for the disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the value of and potential for linking 
genetic data from clinically ascertained research studies to anonymised health 
records. The increased risk for physical illness in schizophrenia is not caused 
by genetic liability for the disorder.

BACKGROUND: Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is clinically understudied, 
and there are no definitive recommendations regarding timing of perioperative 
chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to compare 3 treatment pathways in 
UTUC: nephroureterectomy (NU) alone, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and 
adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) using a microsimulation model.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An individual-level state transition model was constructed 
using TreeAgePro software to compare treatment strategies for patients with 
newly diagnosed UTUC. The base case was that of a 70-year-old patient with a 
radiographically localized upper tract tumor. Primary outcome was 
quality-adjusted life expectancy. Secondary outcomes included crude overall 
survival, rates of adverse events, and bladder cancer diagnoses.
RESULTS: A total of 100,000 patients were simulated. NAC was preferred, with an 
estimated quality-adjusted life expectancy of 7.50 years versus 6.79 years with 
NU alone and 7.23 years with AC. Median crude overall survival was 123 months 
with NAC, 96 months with NU only, and 111 months with AC. Overall, 40.0% of 
patients in the AC group with invasive pathology completed chemotherapy. In the 
NAC group, 83.3% of patients completed chemotherapy. In the NAC group, 37.5% of 
patients experienced an adverse chemotherapy event compared to 15.1% of patients 
in the AC group. Bladder cancer recurrence rates were 64.9%, 65.9%, and 67.4% 
over the patient's lifetime for the NU, NAC, and AC strategies, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the increased use of NAC in UTUC until robust 
randomized trials are completed. The ultimate choice should be based on patient 
and tumor factors.

BACKGROUND: The value of a complete response to immune checkpoint inhibitor 
treatment for urothelial cancer is well recognised, but less is known about 
long-term outcomes in patients with a partial response or the benefit of 
achieving disease stabilisation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical outcomes in patients with a partial response or 
stable disease on atezolizumab therapy for advanced urinary tract carcinoma 
(UTC).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were extracted from three prospective 
trials (IMvigor210 cohort 2, SAUL, and IMvigor211) evaluating single-agent 
atezolizumab therapy for platinum-pretreated advanced UTC. The analysis 
population included 604 atezolizumab-treated and 208 chemotherapy-treated 
patients (229 achieving a partial response and 583 achieving stable disease).
INTERVENTION: Atezolizumab 1200 mg every 3 wk until progression or unacceptable 
toxicity or single-agent chemotherapy for patients in the control arm of 
IMvigor211.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Baseline characteristics, 
treatment exposure, overall survival, duration of disease control. Partial 
response and stable disease populations were analysed separately.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The population of patients with a partial response 
included more patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on 
≥5% of tumour-infiltrating immune cells than the stable disease population. The 
median time to best response was 2.1 mo across trials and treatments, regardless 
of the type of response. Atezolizumab-treated patients with a partial response 
had sustained disease control (median overall survival not reached); durations 
of disease control and overall survival were longer with atezolizumab than with 
chemotherapy. In patients with stable disease, median overall survival was 
numerically longer with atezolizumab (exceeding 1 yr) than with chemotherapy. 
Irrespective of treatment, durations of disease control and survival were 
shorter in patients with stable disease than in those achieving a partial 
response. These analyses are limited by their post hoc exploratory nature and 
relatively short follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Stable disease and partial response are meaningful clinical 
outcomes in atezolizumab-treated patients with advanced UTC.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at the outcomes in patients whose 
tumours responded to treatment to some extent, but the tumour did not disappear 
completely. We aimed to understand whether a modest response to treatment was 
associated with meaningful long-term outcomes for patients. We found that on 
average, life expectancy was >1 yr in patients whose disease was stabilised and 
even longer in those whose tumours showed some shrinkage in response to 
treatment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increasing mortality and decreasing life expectancy in 
the USA are largely attributable to accidental overdose, alcohol-related disease 
and suicide. These 'deaths of despair' often follow years of morbidity, yet 
little is known about trends in the clinical recognition of 'diseases of 
despair'. The objective of this study is to characterise rates of clinically 
documented diseases of despair over the last decade and identify 
sociodemographic risk factors.
DESIGN: Retrospective study using a healthcare claims database with 10 years of 
follow-up.
SETTING: Participants resided nationwide but were concentrated in US states 
disproportionately affected by deaths of despair, including Pennsylvania, West 
Virginia and Delaware.
PARTICIPANTS: Cohort included 12 144 252 participants, with no restriction by 
age or gender.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Diseases of despair were defined as diagnoses related to 
alcohol misuse, substance misuse and suicide ideation/behaviours. A lookback 
period was used to identify incident diagnoses. Annual and all-time 
incidence/prevalence estimates were computed, along with risk for current 
diagnosis and patterns of comorbidity.
RESULTS: 515 830 participants received a disease of despair diagnosis (58.5% 
male, median 36 years). From 2009 to 2018, the prevalence of alcohol-related, 
substance-related and suicide-related diagnoses respectively increased by 37%, 
94%, and 170%. Ages 55-74 had the largest increase in alcohol/substance-related 
diagnoses (59% and 172%). Ages <18 had the largest increase in suicide-related 
diagnoses (287%). Overall, odds for current-year diagnosis were higher among men 
(adjusted OR (AOR) 1.49, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.51), and among those with Affordable 
Care Act or Medicare coverage relative to commercial coverage (AOR 1.30, 1.24 to 
1.37; AOR 1.51, 1.46 to 1.55).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing clinical rates of disease of despair diagnoses largely 
mirror broader societal trends in mortality. While the opioid crisis remains a 
top public health priority, parallel rises in alcohol-related diagnoses and 
suicidality must be concurrently addressed. Findings suggest opportunities for 
healthcare systems and providers to deploy targeted prevention to mitigate the 
progression of morbidities towards mortality.
