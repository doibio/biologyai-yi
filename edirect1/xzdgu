Philosophers of medicine have formulated different accounts of the concept of 
disease. Which concept of disease one assumes has implications for what 
conditions count as diseases and, by extension, who may be regarded as having a 
disease (disease judgements) and for who may be accorded the social privileges 
and personal responsibilities associated with being sick (sickness judgements). 
In this article, we consider an ideal diagnostic test for coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) infection with respect to four groups of people-positive and 
asymptomatic; positive and symptomatic; negative; and untested-and show how 
different concepts of disease impact on the disease and sickness judgements for 
these groups. The suggestion is that sickness judgements and social measures 
akin to those experienced during the current COVID-19 outbreak presuppose a 
concept of disease containing social (risk of) harm as a component. We indicate 
the problems that arise when adopting this kind of disease concept beyond a 
state of emergency.

The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the world 
has led to millions of infection cases and caused a global public health crisis. 
Current research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious coronavirus 
that spreads rapidly through communities. To understand the mechanisms of viral 
replication, it is imperative to investigate coronavirus viral replicase, a huge 
protein complex comprising up to 16 viral nonstructural and associated host 
proteins, which is the most promising antiviral target for inhibiting viral 
genome replication and transcription. Recently, several components of the viral 
replicase complex in SARS-CoV-2 have been solved to provide a basis for the 
design of new antiviral therapeutics. Here, we report the crystal structure of 
the SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 tetramer, which comprises two copies of each protein 
representing nsp7's full-length and the C-terminus of nsp8 owing to N-terminus 
proteolysis during the process of crystallization. We also identified a long 
helical extension and highly flexible N-terminal domain of nsp8, which is 
preferred for interacting with single-stranded nucleic acids.

Structural deterioration of transcatheter heart valve (THV) has been previously 
described. With the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 
indications toward treating lower risk patients with longer life expectancy, 
there will be increased necessity of managing the patients with THV dysfunction 
including those at risk for coronary obstruction or sinus sequestration. 
Coronary access also remains a challenge in such cases with THV dysfunction 
undergoing valve-in-transcatheter heart valve (ViTHV) TAVR. A unique and first 
reported case of THV deterioration treated with Sapien 3 ViTHV-TAVR inside a 
31 mm CoreValve bioprosthesis along with left coronary leaflet laceration using 
the BASILICA technique has been presented.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab with 
trastuzumab biosimilar and docetaxel as initial treatment for HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in Singapore.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states was developed to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab biosimilar and docetaxel with or 
without pertuzumab from a healthcare system perspective over a 15-year time 
horizon for patients with HER2-positive MBC. Key clinical inputs were derived 
from the CLEOPATRA trial. Health state utilities were derived from the 
literature and direct medical costs were obtained from local public healthcare 
institutions.
RESULTS: The base-case resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of SGD366,658 (USD272,244) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. 
One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER was sensitive to utilities in 
the progression-free state, price of pertuzumab and time horizon. When the price 
for trastuzumab reference biologic (branded) was applied, the ICER was even 
higher (SGD426,996 [USD317,045]/QALY).
CONCLUSION: Although trastuzumab biosimilar reduced the cost of the pertuzumab 
combination regimen, the ICER remained high and was not cost effective in 
Singapore's context. As pertuzumab contributed 80% of the overall combination 
treatment cost, price reductions for pertuzumab will be required to improve the 
cost-effectiveness of combination treatment to an acceptable level.

Compliant Compression Reconstruction of the Proximal Femur Is Durable Despite 
Minimal Bone Formation in the Compression Segment.

    Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2021 Jul 1;479(7):1586-1588.

BACKGROUND: Compliant compression fixation was developed to promote permanent 
bone-prosthesis osteointegration while preserving bone stock in patients needing 
endoprosthetic reconstructions. This has demonstrated durability in the distal 
femur, with reliable cortical hypertrophy adjacent to the implant. However, the 
extent of bone formation and prosthetic survivorship of proximal femoral 
replacements with compliant compression fixation has not been established.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) How much bone formation occurs across the compression 
segment in patients treated with a proximal femoral replacement implant using 
compliant compression fixation? (2) What were the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 
(MSTS) scores at minimum 24-month follow-up of patients who received this 
reconstruction? (3) What is the implant survivorship free from implant removal 
or revision for any reason at final follow-up?
METHODS: From 2006 to 2018, we performed 213 proximal femoral replacements in 
patients with oncologic conditions of the proximal femur where the trochanters 
could not be preserved. Of these, 6% (12 of 213) were performed with an implant 
that used compliant compression fixation. We used this device in primary 
oncologic reconstructions in patients younger than 65 years of age without 
metastases who had nonirradiated bone with the requisite ≥ 2.5 mm of cortical 
thickness in the hope that it would provide more durable fixation and bone stock 
preservation than conventional reconstructions. All patients were followed for 
longer than 2 years except one who died in that interval. Median (range) 
follow-up was 6 years (2 to 10 years). Seven patients received 
diagnosis-specific chemotherapy in a consistent manner based on Children's 
Oncology Group chemotherapy protocols. Using the NIH-developed ImageJ 
open-access software, we measured the area of bone under compression on 3-, 6-, 
9-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month radiographs and the length of the traction bar 
potential-compression distance, reconciling independent measures from two 
investigators using the identical method as published for the distal femur with 
compression fixation. The duration of prosthesis retention was evaluated using a 
competing risk analysis for the 11 surviving patients.
RESULTS: Bone hypertrophy in the compression segment was scant. At the final 
analysis, cortical bone formation was a median (range) of 4 (-7 to 14) above 
baseline. The median (range) MSTS score was 27 (19 to 30). One implant failed 
after trauma, and the patient underwent revision of the implant.
CONCLUSION: Despite scant bone formation across the compression segment and 
drastically less formation than reported for distal femoral replacements, 
compliant compression fixation of the proximal femur demonstrated good 
survivorship in patients 65 years or younger with localized sarcoma and 
nonirradiated, adequate bone stock in this small, retrospective series. Patients 
achieved good functional outcomes at final follow-up. The potential benefit of 
this reconstruction method should be weighed against the initial period of 
limited weightbearing and the life expectancy of the patient.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, cohort study.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains 
a challenge due to the lack of specific blood biomarkers. We aimed to develop a 
serum multi-protein signature for the early detection of ESCC.
METHODS: We selected 70 healthy controls, 30 precancerous patients, 60 stage I 
patients, 70 stage II patients and 70 stage III/IV ESCC patients from a 
completed ESCC case-control study in a high-risk area of China. Olink Multiplex 
Oncology II targeted proteomics panel was used to simultaneously detect the 
levels of 92 cancer-related proteins in serum using proximity extension assay.
RESULTS: We found that 10 upregulated and 13 downregulated protein biomarkers in 
serum could distinguish the early-stage ESCC from healthy controls, which were 
validated by the significant dose-response relationships with ESCC pathological 
progression. Applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression and backward elimination algorithm, ANXA1 (annexin A1), hK8 
(kallikrein-8), hK14 (kallikrein-14), VIM (vimentin), and RSPO3 (R-spondin-3) 
were kept in the final model to discriminate early ESCC cases from healthy 
controls with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.936 (95% confidence interval: 
0.899 ~ 0.973). The average accuracy rates of the five-protein classifier were 
0.861 and 0.825 in training and test data by five-fold cross-validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that a combination of ANXA1, hK8, hK14, VIM and 
RSPO3 serum proteins could be considered as a potential tool for screening and 
early diagnosis of ESCC, especially with the establishment of a three-level 
hierarchical screening strategy for ESCC control.

Premature mortality is often a neglected component of overall deaths, and the 
most difficult to identify. However, it is important to estimate its prevalence. 
Following Pearson's theory about mortality components, a definition of premature 
deaths and a parametric model to study its transformations are introduced. The 
model is a mixture of three distributions: a Half Normal for the first part of 
the death curve and two Skew Normals to fit the remaining pieces. One advantage 
of the model is the possibility of obtaining an explicit equation to compute 
life expectancy at birth and to break it down into mortality components. We 
estimated the mixture model for Sweden, France, East Germany and Czech Republic. 
In addition, to the well-known reduction in infant deaths, and compression and 
shifting trend of adult mortality, we were able to study the trend of the 
central part of the distribution of deaths in detail. In general, a right shift 
of the modal age at death for young adults is observed; in some cases, it is 
also accompanied by an increase in the number of deaths at these ages: in 
particular for France, in the last twenty years, premature mortality increases.

Sirtuins are NAD+ dependent histone deacetylases (HDAC) that play a pivotal role 
in neuroprotection and cellular senescence. SIRT1-7 are different homologs from 
sirtuins. They play a prominent role in many aspects of physiology and regulate 
crucial proteins. Modulation of sirtuins can thus be utilized as a therapeutic 
target for metabolic disorders. Neurological diseases have distinct clinical 
manifestations but are mainly age-associated and due to loss of protein 
homeostasis. Sirtuins mediate several life extension pathways and brain 
functions that may allow therapeutic intervention for age-related diseases. 
There is compelling evidence to support the fact that SIRT1 and SIRT2 are 
shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm and perform context-dependent 
functions in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). In this review, we 
highlight the regulation of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in various neurological diseases. 
This study explores the various modulators that regulate the activity of SIRT1 
and SIRT2, which may further assist in the treatment of neurodegenerative 
disease. Moreover, we analyze the structure and function of various small 
molecules that have potential significance in modulating sirtuins, as well as 
the technologies that advance the targeted therapy of neurodegenerative disease.

BACKGROUND: Marital satisfaction is an important variable in maintaining or 
promoting elderly health. Therefore, identifying the effective factors can 
increase life expectancy and quality of life. This study aimed to determine the 
relationship between aging perception and demographic and clinical 
characteristics with marital satisfaction in the elderly patients with coronary 
artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: This was a descriptive-correlational study. The sample size was 480 
elderly patients with CAD who were referred to the heart clinics of hospitals in 
the west of Mazandaran Province, Iran, who were recruited by convenience 
sampling. Data were collected by a demographic checklist, ENRICH Marital 
Satisfaction Inventory, and Aging Perceptions Questionnaire (APQ). The data were 
analyzed by structural equation model (SEM) using Goodness of Fit Index (GFI and 
chi-square test. P-value less than 0.050 was considered as significant level.
RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation (SD) of marital satisfaction was 145.16 
± 12.12, and the mean and SD of aging perception was 113.39 ± 12.74. The results 
of the Pearson's correlation coefficient indicated that the highest correlation 
was between aging perception and marital satisfaction (r = 0.68, P < 0.001). The 
model fit indices of the hypothesized model met the criteria, with the GFI = 
0.91, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.93, Normed Fit Index (NFI) = 0.94, and 
non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) = 0.91.
CONCLUSION: Considering the psychological risk factors affecting marital 
satisfaction such as aging perception and suitable measurement can lead to 
marital health and improve treatment outcomes by increasing elderly motivation 
in self-care. Therefore, the elderly patients with CAD need more serious and 
long-term educational, counseling, and supportive interventions.

In the present study, a hydroalcoholic extract of P. khinjuk was obtained by 
sonication method at 60°C for 50 min. The measurement revealed that the total 
phenolic content of the extract was 46.0 mg/g. The results showed that the 
extract has an antioxidant activity of 73.5% and 8.3 (µmol TE/g DW) in DPPH 
radical scavenging method and FRAP assay, respectively. Also, Balango 
(Lallemantia royleana) and Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seed gum and 
their composition (1:1) were used to prepare the nanoemulsion with P. khinjuk 
extract. The droplet mean size of nanoemulsions was ranged from 310.34 to 
354.19 nm. The highest encapsulation efficiency was observed in Balango 
nanoemulsion. P. khinjuk extract nanoemulsion coating with Balango and TBHQ was 
added to sunflower oil at 200 and 100 ppm, respectively. During 24-day storage 
at 60°C, samples were investigated for peroxide, acid, and p-anisidine values at 
4-day intervals. The results showed that oils containing nanoemulsion had the 
highest stability during storage. However, in all samples peroxide, acid and 
p-anisidine values increased but the rate of oxidation in samples containing 
both synthetic and natural antioxidants was slower than the control sample.

Socioeconomic inequalities in disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) exist 
across all European countries, yet the driving determinants of these differences 
are not completely known. We calculated the impact on educational inequalities 
in DFLE of equalizing the distribution of eight risk factors for mortality and 
disability using register-based mortality data and survey data from 15 European 
countries for individuals between 35 and 80 years old. From the selected risk 
factors, the ones that contribute the most to the educational inequalities in 
DFLE are low income, high body-weight, smoking (for men), and manual occupation 
of the father. Potentially large reductions in inequalities can be achieved in 
Eastern European countries, where educational inequalities in DFLE are also the 
largest.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) have impaired 
physical, psychological, and social functions, which can diminish patient 
quality of life, burden family caregivers, and increase health-care utilization. 
For those with a life expectancy of less than six months, these impairments and 
their downstream effects can be addressed effectively through high-quality 
hospice care, delivered by multidisciplinary teams and focused on the physical, 
emotional, social, and spiritual wellbeing of patients and caregivers, with a 
goal of improving quality of life.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we examine the evidence supporting hospice for 
ESLD, we compare this evidence to that supporting hospice more broadly, and we 
identify potential criteria that may be useful in determining hospice 
appropriateness.
EXPERT OPINION: Despite the potential for hospice to improve care for those at 
the end of life, it is underutilized for patients with ESLD. Increasing the 
appropriate utilization of hospice for ESLD requires a better understanding of 
patient eligibility, which can be based on predictors of high short-term 
mortality and liver transplant ineligibility. Such hospice criteria should be 
data-driven and should accommodate the uncertainty faced by patients and 
physicians.

The success of Western Scientific approaches to medicine, over the last 150 
years, can be measured by substantial increases in life expectancy, reductions 
in infant mortality and the virtual elimination of many infectious diseases 
accompanied by development of effective management practices for noncommunicable 
diseases. However, major challenges remain in the form of infectious diseases 
that evolve resistance to pharmaceuticals rapidly, new diseases, particularly 
those caused by viruses and effective long-term treatments for chronic, 
noncommunicable diseases. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can offer 
complementary treatments based on personalised interventions, informed by 
knowledge accumulated from empirical observations gathered over centuries of 
practice, that address the impact of disease on the whole body. We provide 
examples of both infectious and noncommunicable diseases where the combination 
of Western Scientific Medicine (WSM) and TCM can benefit patients in terms of 
the speed and efficacy of recovery or disease management. TCM is a healing skill 
based on practice, while WSM is scientific, based on experiments. Against this 
background, an understanding of the mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese 
medicinal preparations will offer fresh routes to discovery and development of 
new therapeutics as well as patented medical prescriptions, which will rely 
heavily on modern scientific methodologies for their adoption and success, 
particularly those in plant genomics, plant breeding and synthetic biology.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is being increasingly 
used in patients with longer life expectancy. Data on long‑term outcomes are 
still limited.
AIMS: The aim of the study was to assess the clinical outcomes of patients 
treated with TAVI and identify baseline and procedure‑related factors 
influencing long‑term survival.
METHODS: Symptomatic patients with critical aortic stenosis who were inoperable 
or had high surgical risk were qualified for TAVI. Between August 2012 and 
December 2017, 248 consecutive patients treated with self ‑expanding Medtronic 
valve implantation at American Heart of Poland in Bielsko‑Biała were 
prospectively enrolled. Patients were followed for 30 days after the procedure 
and subsequently annually. All events were classified according to the Valve 
Academic Research Consortium‑2 (VARC‑2) criteria and assessed. Survival was 
compared between the subgroups defined by the EuroSCORE II (European System for 
Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II) and with matched representatives from the 
general population.
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) follow‑up was 3.4 (2.5-4.6) years, and 
the longest follow‑up lasted 7.8 years. A total of 92 patients (37.1%) died 
during the follow‑up. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for cumulative mortality at 1, 
3, 5, and 7 years were: 11.3%, 26.8%, 42.1%, and 60.6%. Patients with EuroSCORE 
II greater than 6% experienced worse survival compared with those with EuroSCORE 
II 6% or less (P = 0.008). Patients with EuroSCORE II 6% or less had similar 
survival to the general population. Male sex, baseline eGFR of less than 50 
ml/min/1.73 m2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate / severe 
paravalvular leak, absence of postdilatation, major vascular complication, and 
stroke at 30 days were independently associated with long‑term mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI with a self‑expanding Medtronic valve implantation according 
to a consistent protocol was associated with favorable outcomes. Patients with 
lower EuroSCORE II scores had the same prognosis as the actuarial survival of 
the general population.

Precise assembly of the cytoskeleton (e.g., actin, tubulin, and intermediate 
filaments) is of great importance for stem cell polarization and tissue 
regeneration. Recently, artificial manipulation of cytoskeleton assembly for 
remodeling stem cell polarization and ultimate cell fates attracts more and more 
interest of both chemists and biologists. Herein, we report the magnetic 
field-directed formation of biocompatible supramolecular polymeric nanofibers 
composed of two subunits: a β-cyclodextrin-bearing hyaluronic acid host polymer 
(HACD) and magnetic nanoparticles modified with actin-binding peptide and 
adamantane (MS-ABPAda). Transmission electron microscopy indicated that when 
HACD and MS-ABPAda were exposed to a magnetic field, they self-assembled into 
long nanofibers along the direction of the magnetic field, and the rate of 
nanofiber formation was linearly correlated with the strength of the magnetic 
field. Interestingly, when incubated with dental pulp stem cells, the nanofibers 
specifically drove tip extension and polarization of the cells, a phenomenon 
that can be attributed to targeting of actin-binding peptide to the actin 
cytoskeleton and subsequent polarization of the nanofibers. The successful 
application of these magnetic field-responsive supramolecular polymers on 
accurately driving polarization of mammalian cells is expected to be of great 
value for artificially manipulating cell fate and developing intelligent 
responsive materials in regenerative medicine.

IMPORTANCE: Occupational exposure to carcinogens has been shown to pose a 
serious disease burden at the global, regional, and national levels. Based on 
epidemiologic studies and clinical observations, working environment appears to 
have important effects on the occurrence of human malignant tumors; however, to 
date, no systematic articles have been published that specifically investigated 
cancer burden due to occupational exposure in an individual and collective 
manner.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the degree of exposure and evaluate the cancer burden 
attributable to occupational carcinogens (OCs) individually and collectively by 
sex, age, year, and location.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study including data on 195 
countries from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from June 24, 
2020, to July 20, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Thirteen OCs (ie, arsenic, asbestos, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, 
chromium, diesel engine exhaust, formaldehyde, nickel, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons, silica, sulfuric acid, and trichloroethylene).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The degree and change patterns of exposure as well 
as the attributable cancer burden, including deaths and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), by sex, age, year, and location for 13 OCs. The calculation of 
the population-attributable fraction was based on past exposure in the 
population and relative risks.
RESULTS: Based on the GBD 2017 study, 13 OCs attributable to 7 cancer types were 
included. Most summary exposure values for the 13 OCs, particularly those of 
diesel engine exhaust (35.6% increase; 95% uncertainty interval [UI], 
32.4%-38.5%) and trichloroethylene (30.3% increase; 95% UI, 27.3%-33.5%), 
increased from 1990 to 2017. Only exposure to asbestos decreased by 13.8% (95% 
UI, -26.7% to 2.2%). In 2017, 319 000 (95% UI, 256 000-382 000) cancer deaths 
and 6.42 million (95% UI, 5.15 million to 7.76 million) DALYs were associated 
with OCs combined, accounting for 61.0% (95% UI, 59.6%-62.4%) of the total 
cancer deaths and 48.3% (46.3% to 50.2%) of the DALYs. Among the 13 OCs, the 3 
leading risk factors for cancer burden were asbestos (71.8%), silica (15.4%), 
and diesel engine exhaust (5.6%). For most OCs, the attributed cancer outcome 
was tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer, which accounted for 89.0% of 
attributable cancer deaths. China (61 644 cancer deaths), the US (42 848), and 
Japan (20 748) accounted for the largest number of attributable cancer deaths in 
2017; for DALYs, China (1.47 million), the US (0.71 million), and India (0.37 
million) were the 3 leading countries.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this study suggest that although OC 
exposure levels have decreased, the overall cancer burden is continuously 
increasing.

The resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) within the framework of a 
multimodal treatment concept is a generally accepted and potentially curative 
treatment approach. Despite the fact that liver surgery represents a survival 
extension for patients with a good quality of life, this treatment option is 
offered to nowhere near all patients. This article summarizes the results of 
liver resection for CRLM patients and discusses the reasons for the different 
estimations of resectability even by experienced liver surgeons. The complexity 
of the treatment is exemplarily shown based on a case report.

Publisher: Die Resektion kolorektaler Lebermetastasen (CRLM) im Rahmen eines

BACKGROUND: Failure of conservative treatment in patients over 70 years of age 
with a rotator cuff tear makes surgery a possible option, considering the 
increase in life expectancy and the high functional demands of elderly patients. 
The purpose of this systematic review of the literature was to evaluate the 
subjective and objective outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in 
patients over 70 years of age.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify all the studies reporting 
subjective and objective outcomes in patients aged 70 years or older undergoing 
arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Constant Murley Score (CMS), visual analog 
scale (VAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES), and Simple 
Shoulder Test (SST) were used to detect any clinical improvement after surgery. 
Retear and satisfaction were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 941 studies identified, only 6 papers have been included in the 
review. All studies reported improvements in postoperative functional outcome 
scores that exceed the minimal clinically relevant difference. The mean retear 
rate amounts to 21.9%, which is in line with the failure rate of rotator cuff 
repair in general population. Moreover, postoperative satisfaction is very high 
(95%).
CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that arthroscopic rotator cuff 
repair in patients over 70 years of age could be a valid treatment option after 
failure of conservative approach.

24. Clinical Review Report: Caplacizumab (Cablivi): (Sanofi Genzyme, a division
of  Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc.): Indication: Indicated for the treatment of
adults  with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) in combination
with  plasma exchange (PEX) and immunosuppressive therapy [Internet].

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2020 Oct.
CADTH Common Drug Reviews.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but serious thrombotic 
microangiopathy. It is characterized by small-vessel platelet-rich thrombi that 
cause thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and, sometimes, 
organ ischemia. Acquired TTP (aTTP), which is due to autoantibodies against a 
disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 
(ADAMTS13) and is usually associated with an ADAMTS13 activity level of less 
than 10%, is the most common form of TTP (95%). The incidence of aTTP was 
reported in the literature to be 1.2 to 13 cases per million. In Canada, the 
number of patients with aTTP was estimated to be 173 in 2018.3 Since the 
development of therapeutic plasma exchange (PEX) or plasma infusion in the 
1980s, mortality due to aTTP has decreased from 90% to a range of 10% to 20%. 
Early diagnosis and treatment of aTTP is essential to the patient’s survival. 
Despite advances in understanding the disease and evolving treatment regimens, 
surviving patients with aTTP are still at risk for TTP exacerbation or relapse, 
refractory disease, or long-term consequences such as cognitive deficits, 
depression, hypertension, renal impairment, development of systemic lupus 
erythematosus, and reduced life expectancy. Daily PEX plus immunosuppressive 
therapies (primarily corticosteroids) are the mainstay of treatment. It allows 
removal of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and replenishment of functional ADAMTS13 and 
von Willebrand factor (vWF). PEX has substantially reduced mortality rates and 
enables faster remission in patients with aTTP although its use is associated 
with a number of adverse events (AEs). When there is a delay in delivering PEX, 
large-volume plasma infusions can be provided. Rituximab is another 
immunosuppressive that is also recommended for patients with aTTP, especially 
for those with refractory or relapsing aTTP, in conjunction with PEX and 
steroids; however, rituximab does not have an indication for aTTP. Refractory 
patients can also be treated with cytotoxic drugs such as cyclophosphamide, and 
splenectomy. Caplacizumab is a humanized, bivalent nanobody targeting the A1 
domain of vWF to inhibit the interaction between vWF and platelets. On February 
28, 2020, caplacizumab was approved by Health Canada for the treatment of adults 
with aTTP in combination with PEX and immunosuppressive therapy. The recommended 
dose of caplacizumab is as follows: First day of treatment: 11 mg IV injection 
prior to PEX followed by an 11 mg subcutaneous injection after completion of PEX 
on that day. Subsequent days of treatment during PEX: daily 11 mg subcutaneous 
injection following PEX. Treatment after PEX period: 11 mg subcutaneous 
injections once daily for 30 days following the last daily PEX. If, after the 
initial treatment course, sign(s) of persistent underlying disease such as 
suppressed ADAMTS13 activity levels rema. The CADTH Canadian Drug Expert 
Committee (CDEC) recommended that caplacizumab not be reimbursed for the 
treatment of adults with aTTP in combination with PEX and immunosuppressive 
therapy (March 6, 2020). A request for reconsideration was received by CADTH for 
this embargoed CDEC recommendation. The revised reimbursement criteria are for a 
narrower population: patients with multi-organ involvement indicating a more 
severe disease or refractory patients who do not respond well to previous 
treatment for a given time period, as determined by a specialist physician with 
expertise in treating aTTP.

INTRODUCTION: Antiviral therapy (AVT) for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can prevent 
liver disease progression. Because of its stringent reimbursement criteria, 
significant numbers of patients with untreated minimally active (UMA)-CHB exist, 
although they are still subject to disease progression. We thus performed a 
cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the rationale for AVT for UMA-CHB.
METHODS: We compared cost and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) 
in virtual UMA-CHB cohorts of 10,000 50-year-olds receiving AVT (scenario 1) vs 
no treatment (scenario 2) for 10 years. A Markov model, including 7 health 
states of CHB-related disease progression, was used. Values for transition 
probabilities and costs were mostly obtained from recent South Korean data.
RESULTS: The simulation of AVT vs no treatment predicted $2,201 incremental 
costs and 0.175 incremental QALYs per patient for 10 years, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $12,607/QALY, suggesting cost-effectiveness 
of AVT. In sum, if 10,000 patients received AVT, 720 incident hepatocellular 
carcinoma and 465 CHB-related more deaths could be averted in 10 years relative 
to no treatment. When the simulated analysis period was extended to 20 years, 
AVT was also highly cost-effective with an ICER of $2,036/QALY. Although 
hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality was a major factor influencing ICER, 
its fluctuation can be accepted within willingness to pay of $33,000 in South 
Korea. According to probabilistic sensitivity analysis with the threshold of 
willingness to pay, the probability of AVT cost-effectiveness was 83.3%.
DISCUSSION: Long-term AVT for patients with UMA-CHB may contribute positively 
toward individual clinical benefit and national health care budget.
