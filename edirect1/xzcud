pathologies other than cancer. In this regard, we review the properties of 
STKIs, dasatinib in particular, including its immunomodulatory role. Similarly, 
the potential benefits, adverse effects, and safety concerns of these inhibitors 
regarding viral infections are considered. Moreover, since life expectancy has 
increased in the last decades accompanied by age-related morbidity, the 
reduction of undesirable effects associated to aging has become a powerful 
therapeutic target. Here, we comment on the ability of STKIs to alleviate 
age-associated physical dysfunction and their potential impact in the clinic.

OBJECTIVES: Medical complications during dental treatment are increasingly 
anticipated because advances in medical treatment have prolonged life 
expectancy. Therefore, a thorough analysis of medical history data to assess the 
medical risks that may occur before, during, and after dental procedures is 
required. The European Medical Risk-Related History (EMRRH) questionnaire has 
been used in 10 European countries to detect medical problems and determine the 
risks of complications. However, no similar questionnaire has been developed for 
Indonesian patients. This study aimed to develop an Indonesian version of the 
EMRRH questionnaire and analyze its psychometric properties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EMRRH questionnaire was utilized and processed for 
cross-cultural adaptation according to the Beaton guidelines. The final version 
was used after completing all of the steps of cross-cultural adaptation. The 
psychometric property analysis was performed by measuring the validity, 
reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of the questionnaire in 172 dental 
patients using cross-sectional survey at the National Drug Rehabilitation 
Center.
RESULTS: The content validity was first measured by an internist and 
anesthesiologist, and the coefficient was 0.91. The construct validity 
assessment revealed significant associations for five of six global questions (P 
< 0.05). Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency was 0.790. The 
test-retest reliability results were excellent based on reevaluation in 17 
patients (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.846), including sensitivity and 
specificity values of 69.31% and 92.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The Indonesian version of the EMRRH questionnaire is valid, 
reliable, sensitive, and specific for this population. Further study to explore 
its use in larger Indonesian populations is needed.

Bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) it is the fifth most prevalent carcinoma in 
humans, nevertheless in children and young adults it's very rare. It usually 
occurs in older adults. Literature on UC in pediatric population is limited and 
important information (risk factors, follow-up protocols, etc.) are poorly 
defined. We present an 11-year-old boy with a painful macroscopic hematuria. 
Ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous intravesical mass without extravesical 
extension, which was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). The first biopsy was compatible with urothelial 
papilloma. After 1 year, he returned with a bigger mass. Transurethral resection 
of the bladder (TURB) was performed and immunohistochemistry showed low-grade 
papillary UC with a high-grade component, with tumor free margin. Tumor had 
mutations in the BRAF and KRAS genes. Two and a half years after the resection 
the patient has no recurrence. Less than 1% of bladder UC occur in the first two 
decades of life. Gross hematuria is a common symptom. Ultrasound is generally 
the first diagnostic tool. MRI is also helpful, but cystoscopy allows definitive 
diagnosis. Transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) is the standard 
treatment, with good results and low recurrence rate, and it was the treatment 
of choice for our patient, that remains free of disease. The BRAF and KRAS gene 
mutations were never described before in pediatric UC. There are only few cases 
in literature of pediatric UC that present a tumor genetic profile; therefore, 
our case report adds more information to this very rare disease in children.

Adult spinal deformity (ASD) has gained significant attention over the past 
decade with improvements in diagnostic tools, classification schemes, and 
surgical technique. The demographics of the aging population in the United 
States are undergoing a fundamental shift as medical care advances and life 
expectancy increases. The "baby boomers" represent the fastest growing 
demographic in the United States and by 2050, the number of individuals 65 yr 
and older is projected to reach 89 million, more than double its current size. 
Based on current prevalence estimates there are approximately 27.5 million 
elderly individuals with some form of spinal deformity, which will place a 
significant burden on our health care systems. Rates of surgery for ASD and case 
complexity are both increasing, with concomitant increase in the cost of 
deformity care. At the same time, patients are more medically complex with 
increasing number of comorbidities that result in increased surgical risk and 
complication profiles. This review aims to highlight recent trends in the 
epidemiology and socioeconomic patterns in surgery for ASD.

BACKGROUND: Risk stratification of older patients in the emergency department 
(ED) is seen as a promising and efficient solution for handling the increase in 
demand for geriatric emergency medicine. Previously, the predictive validity of 
commonly used tools for risk stratification, such as the identification of 
seniors at risk (ISAR), have found only limited evidence in German geriatric 
patient samples. Given that the adverse outcomes in question, such as 
rehospitalization, nursing home admission and mortality, are substantially 
associated with cognitive impairment, the potential of the short portable mental 
status questionnaire (SPMSQ) as a tool for risk stratification of older ED 
patients was investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the predictive validity of the SPMSQ for a composite 
endpoint of adverse events (e.g. rehospitalization, nursing home admission and 
mortality).
METHOD: This was a prospective cohort study with 260 patients aged 70 years and 
above, recruited in a cardiology ED. Patients with a likely life-expectancy 
below 24 h were excluded. Follow-up examinations were conducted at 1, 3, 6 and 
12 month(s) after recruitment.
RESULTS: The SPMSQ was found to be a significant predictor of adverse outcomes 
not at 1 month (area under the curve, AUC 0.55, 95% confidence interval, CI 
0.46-0.63) but at 3 months (AUC 0.61, 95% CI 0.54-0.68), 6 months (AUC 0.63, 95% 
CI 0.56-0.70) and 12 months (AUC 0.63, 95% CI 0.56-0.70) after initial contact.
CONCLUSION: For longer periods of observation the SPMSQ can be a predictor of 
a composite endpoint of adverse outcomes even when controlled for a range of 
confounders. Its characteristics, specifically the low sensitivity, make it 
unsuitable as an accurate risk stratification tool on its own.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Die Risikostratifizierung von älteren 
Patienten in der Notaufnahme gilt als vielversprechender und effizienter 
Lösungsansatz, um die steigende Nachfrage nach geriatrischer Notfallmedizin zu 
bewältigen. Bisher zeigte sich die prädiktive Validität des am häufigsten 
eingesetzten Instruments, dem Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR), für 
deutsche Stichproben jedoch als begrenzt. Da die interessierenden Outcomes, wie 
Rehospitalisierung, Pflegeheimübersiedlung und Mortalität deutlich mit 
kognitiver Beeinträchtigung zusammenhängen, war es unser Ziel, das Potenzial des 
Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) als Instrument zur 
Risikostratifizierung von älteren Notaufnahmepatienten zu überprüfen.
FRAGESTELLUNG: Schätzung der prädiktiven Validität des SPMSQ für einen 
kombinierten Endpunkt adverser Outcomes (Rehospitalisierung, 
Pflegeheimübersiedlung und Mortalität).
DATEN UND METHODE: Es handelte sich um eine prospektive Kohortenstudie mit 260 
Patienten im Alter von mindestens 70 Jahren, die in einer kardiologischen 
Notaufnahme rekrutiert worden waren. Patienten mit einer Lebenserwartung von 
unter 24 h wurden exkludiert. Follow-ups fanden nach 1, 3, 6, und 12 Monaten 
statt.
ERGEBNISSE: SPMSQ war signifikanter Prädiktor für den kombinierten Endpunkt 
adverser Outcomes zwar nicht für 1 Monat (AUC: 0,55; 95 % KI 0,46–0,63), aber 
für 3 Monate (AUC: 0,61; 95 % KI 0,54–0,68), 6 Monate (AUC: 0,63; 95 % KI 
0,56–0,70) und 12 Monate (AUC: 0,63; 95 % KI 0,56–0,70) nach Erstkontakt.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Für längere Beobachtungszeiträume scheint der SPMSQ, auch 
unter Kontrolle potenziell konfundierender Variablen, ein Prädiktor für adverse 
Outcomes zu sein. Seine Eigenschaften, insbesondere die niedrige Sensitivität, 
machen ihn jedoch für den Einsatz als alleiniges Screening-Instrument wenig 
tauglich.

In the last decade, there have clearly been important changes in the surgical 
approach of gastric cancer treatment due to an increased interest in the 
minimally invasive surgical approach (MIS). The higher cost of robotic surgery 
procedures remains an important issue of debate. The objective of the study is 
to compare the main operative and clinical outcomes and to assess the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the two techniques. This is a 
prospective cost-effectiveness and clinical study when comparing the robotic 
gastrectomy (RG) technique with open gastrectomy (OG) in gastric cancer. Outcome 
parameters included surgical and post-operative costs, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY) and incremental cost per QALY gained or the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The incremental utility was 0.038 QALYs and the 
estimated ICER for patients was dominated by robotic approach. The probability 
that the robotic approach was cost effective was 94.04% and 94.20%, 
respectively, at a WTP threshold of 20,000€ and 30,000€ per QALY gained. RG for 
gastric cancer represents a cost-effective procedure compared with the standard 
OG.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common age-related chronic and disabling joint 
disease. Long considered to be a "wear and tear" disease, OA is now seen as a 
low-grade inflammation disease that affects all tissues of the joint, involving 
cartilage degradation, bone remodelling, osteophytes, and synovitis. The 
process, called inflammaging, is characterised by the association of low-grade 
inflammation, profound changes in intra-cellular mechanisms, and the decreased 
efficiency of the immune system with ageing. The activation of innate immunity 
plays a critical role in the development and progression of OA. Innate immunity, 
including inflammasome activation, is triggered by small endogenous molecules 
called alarmins or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These molecules 
are released in the extracellular media after cell stress or damage, bind to 
pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and 
the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and activate the 
secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, leading to joint inflammation. Moreover, 
such sterile inflammation triggers cell senescence, characterised by a 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Understanding the substantial 
age-related changes of joint tissues that influence the pathogenesis of OA is 
critical to improving the quality of life of elderly people in the context of 
increased life expectancy. This review will focus on age-related sterile 
inflammation in OA and highlight the various innovative and promising therapies 
targeting the mechanisms of aging.

INTRODUCTION: BAY 94-9027 is an extended-half-life, site-specifically PEGylated, 
B-domain-deleted recombinant factor VIII (FVIII). The PROTECT VIII main study 
demonstrated efficacy of bleed control using extended-interval prophylaxis with 
BAY 94-9027 for 36 weeks.
AIM: To report long-term efficacy and safety of prophylaxis with BAY 94-9027 in 
a descriptive analysis of the ongoing PROTECT VIII extension with a total 
treatment time of up to >5 years.
METHODS: Previously treated males aged 12-65 years with severe haemophilia A who 
completed the PROTECT VIII main study were eligible for the open-label 
extension. Patients received on-demand treatment or prophylaxis (30-40 IU/kg 
twice weekly, 45-60 IU/kg every 5 days, or 60 IU/kg every 7 days) and could 
switch regimens as needed.
RESULTS: Patients (N = 121; on demand, n = 14; prophylaxis, n = 107) accumulated 
a median (range) of 3.9 years (297-1965 days) and 223 (23-563) total exposure 
days by 31 January 2018. During the extension, median (quartile [Q]1; Q3) 
annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) for total bleeds were 1.6 (0.3; 4.6) for 
patients receiving prophylaxis and 34.1 (20.3; 36.6) for patients receiving 
on-demand treatment. ABRs for twice-weekly (n = 23), every-5-days (n = 33), 
every-7-days (n = 23) and variable frequency (n = 28) treatments were 1.7, 1.2, 
0.7 and 3.1, respectively. Of prophylaxis patients, 20.6% were bleed-free 
throughout the extension (median time, 3.2 years), and 44.5% were bleed-free 
during the last 6 months. No patients developed FVIII inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis was efficacious and well tolerated with 
dosing intervals up to every 7 days for a median (range) of 3.9 years 
(0.8-5.4 years).

Increasing life expectancy in the population means that the prevalence of 
hypertension in China will increase over the coming decades. Although awareness 
and control rates have improved, the absolute rates remain unacceptably low. 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the biggest killer in China, and sharp increases 
in the prevalence of CVD risk factors associated with rapid lifestyle changes 
will contribute to ongoing morbidity and mortality. This highlights the 
importance of effectively diagnosing and managing hypertension, where home blood 
pressure monitoring (HBPM) has an important role. Use of HBPM in China is 
increasing, particularly now that Asia-specific guidance is available, and this 
out-of-office BP monitoring tool will become increasingly important over time. 
To implement these recommendations and guidelines, a Web-based and WeChat-linked 
nationwide BP measurement system is being established in China. Local guidelines 
state that both HBPM and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be 
implemented where available. In China, hypertension is managed most often using 
calcium channel blockers, followed by angiotensin receptor blockers or 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Key barriers to hypertension control 
in China are low awareness and control rates.

OBJECTIVES: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a life-threatening complication of 
chemotherapy that can lead to hospitalizations, chemotherapy dose reductions or 
delays, and mortality. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis 
reduces the incidence of FN, enabling patients to undergo and remain on 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy. We estimate the benefits of continuing current 
G-CSF use patterns and an alternative that aligns prophylactic G-CSF use with 
guideline recommendations.
STUDY DESIGN: Using The Health Economics Medical Innovation Simulation 
microsimulation, we estimated lifetime social value (SV) of prophylactic G-CSF 
for a nationally representative US population with breast, lung, and 
gynecological cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
METHODS: SV estimates included the cost of G-CSF, FN, chemotherapy relative dose 
intensity (RDI) less than 85% (RDI<85%), medical spending, and deaths for 3 
scenarios: current use (current G-CSF use), targeted use (100% G-CSF use among 
patients with high FN risk), and reduced use (current G-CSF use reduced by 20% 
across all FN risk categories).
RESULTS: Over 10 years, current use, compared with no G-CSF use, would decrease 
cases of FN by 3.3 million, prevent 354,000 cases of RDI<85%, and generate $96 
billion in SV. Compared with current use, targeted use would decrease cases of 
FN by an additional 3.3 million, prevent 355,000 more cases of RDI<85%, and 
generate another $119 billion in SV. Reduced use would increase FN and RDI<85%, 
lowering SV by $18 billion compared with current use.
CONCLUSIONS: Current use of G-CSF prophylaxis would provide $96 billion in SV 
over the next 10 years. Targeting G-CSF prophylaxis to align with guidelines 
would more than double SV, highlighting the substantial value of appropriate FN 
risk assessment and targeted G-CSF prophylaxis.

Mississauga-Oakville Veterinary Emergency Hospital, Ontario, Canada (J.A.W.).

The guidelines are an update and extension of the AAHA Canine Life Stage 
Guidelines published in 2012. A noteworthy change from the earlier guidelines is 
the division of the dog's lifespan into five stages (puppy, young adult, mature 
adult, senior, and end of life) instead of the previous six. This simplified 
grouping is consistent with how pet owners generally perceive their dog's 
maturation and aging process and provides a readily understood basis for an 
evolving, lifelong healthcare strategy. The guidelines provide the following 
recommendations for managing 10 health-related factors at each of the first four 
canine life stages: lifestyle effect on the patient's safety, zoonotic and human 
safety risk, behavior, nutrition, parasite control, vaccination, dental health, 
reproduction, breed-specific conditions, and a baseline diagnostic profile.

BACKGROUND: Recent improvements in the health of the oldest old coexist with a 
decline in hip fracture rates, in particular in women. We speculated that 
increased longevity with decreasing hip fracture rates would result in a delay 
in hip fracture. We conducted an analysis of time trends in the age at hip 
fracture, by type and gender, for the past two decades using national data.
STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS: We used data from the Danish Hospital Discharge 
Register (1996-2017) to analyse the age distribution of femoral neck (FN) and 
pertrochanteric fractures (PT), allowing only the first fracture at each of 
these two sites to contribute to the analysis in each calendar year. 
Demographics for the background population at risk including life expectancy 
tabulations, were also obtained.
RESULTS: The average age at FN fracture in women increased slowly but 
significantly by 0.035years - or 12.8 days - per calendar year [0.035, 95% CI 
(0.016; 0.054), p<0.001], resulting in an increase from 79.6 to 80.4 years. 
There were no significant changes in the age at FN fracture in men or the age at 
PT fracture in women and men. Further, increases in life expectancy were 
considerably faster than any change observed in the age at hip fracture. In 
1996, the average age at FN or PT fracture exceeded the average life expectancy 
in both men and women whereas the opposite was the case from 2009 and onwards in 
men and 2015 and onwards in women.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant change in the demographics of 
hip fractures in Denmark over the past two decades. We observed a significant 
increase in the age at FN fracture in women but not in men, with no significant 
increase in the age at IT fracture and PT fracture. This developed much more 
slowly, however, than the increase in life expectancy in both sexes observed 
over the same period of time. Taken together, these changes resulted in a large 
decrease in the female to male incidence rate ratio from 2.6 and 2.5 (FN and PT, 
respectively) to 1.9 and 1.7.Additional effort is required to prevent hip 
fractures to ensure that the increasing life expectancy is matched by a similar 
increase in hip-fracture free life expectancy.

α-Conotoxins (α-CTxs) are small disulfide-rich peptides from venom of Conus 
species that target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The muscle-type 
nAChRs have been recognized as a potential target for several diseases, such as 
myogenic disorders, muscle dystrophies, and myasthenia gravis. EI, an α4/7-CTx, 
mainly blocks α1β1δε nAChRs and has an extra N-terminal extension of three amino 
acids. In this study, the alanine scanning (Ala-scan) mutagenesis was applied in 
order to identify key residues of EI for binding with mouse α1β1δε nAChR. The 
Ala-substituted analogues were tested for their abilities of modulating muscle 
and neuronal nAChRs in Xenopus laevis oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp 
(TEVC) recordings. Electrophysiological results indicated that the vital 
residues for functional activity of EI were His-7, Pro-8, Met-12, and Pro-15. 
These changes exhibited a significant decrease in potency of EI against mouse 
α1β1δε nAChR. Interestingly, replacing the critical serine (Ser) at position 13 
with an alanine (Ala) residue resulted in a 2-fold increase in potency at the 
α1β1δε nAChR, and showed loss of activity on α3β2 and α3β4 nAChRs. Selectivity 
and potency of [S13A] EI was improved compared with wild-type EI (WT EI). In 
addition, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of EI revealed that the 
"Arg1-Asn2-Hyp3" residues at the N-terminus conferred potency at the muscle-type 
nAChRs, and the deletion analogue △1-3 EI caused a total loss of activity at the 
α1β1δε nAChR. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy studies demonstrated that 
activity loss of truncated analogue △1-3 EI for α1β1δε nAChR is attributed to 
disturbance of the secondary structure. In this report, an Ala-scan mutagenesis 
strategy is presented to identify crucial residues that are significantly 
affecting potency of E1 for mouse α1β1δε nAChR. It may also be important in 
remodeling of some novel ligands for inhibiting muscle-type nAChRs.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of both type 1 and 
2 diabetes. It is a leading cause of lower-limb amputation and disabling 
neuropathic pain. Amputations in patients with diabetes have a devastating 
effect on quality of life and are associated with an alarmingly low life 
expectancy (on average only 2 years from the amputation). Amputation also places 
a substantial financial burden on health-care systems and society in general. 
With the introduction of national diabetes eye screening programmes, the 
prevalence of blindness in working-age adults is falling. This is not the case, 
however, with diabetes related amputations. In this Review, we appraise 
innovative point-of-care devices that enable the early diagnosis of DPN and 
assess the evidence for early risk factor-based management strategies to reduce 
the incidence and slow the progression of DPN. We also propose a framework for 
screening and early multifactorial interventions as the best prospect for 
preventing or halting DPN and its devastating sequelae.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Romanian national level stroke mortality data is relatively 
scarce. The current study investigated stroke mortality rates and trends in 
Romania.
METHODS: All individual deaths registered in Romania during 1994-2017 were 
analyzed using an anonymized database, based on death certificates. Stroke crude 
mortality rates (CMR) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) were 
calculated and expressed per 100,000 persons-year.
RESULTS: Between 1994 and 2017, 6,281,873 persons died in Romania, stroke being 
registered as the underlying cause of death in 959,319 cases. The overall stroke 
CMR was 188.2 (199.3 for women and 176.5 for men). The CMR for hemorrhagic 
stroke (HEMS) was 32.4 and for ischemic stroke (ISCS) 10.9. There was a 
significant decrease in stroke ASMR from 344.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
343.4-345.4) in 1994 to 192.1 (95% CI 191.5-192.7) in 2017, with an annual 
percent change (APC) of 2.53% per year (95% CI 2.50-2.55, P < .001). Although 
compared with men, women had higher CMRs, when those rates were age-standardized 
men had higher ASMR as compared with women. The decline in HEMS ASMR had an APC 
of 4.65% per year (95% CI 4.59-4.70, P < .001). ISCS ASMR showed an initial 
increase in ASMR during 1994-2005, with APC 6.39% per year (95% CI 6.09-6.70, P 
< .001), followed by a significant decrease until 2017, with APC 2.83% per year 
(95% CI 2.59-3.07, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in stroke ASMR during 1994-2017. 
The decline was slow until 2002 and became steeper after that, with significant 
differences in gender analysis.

OBJECTIVES: The burden of gout has been increasing globally. However, little is 
known about the global, regional and national distribution and time trend of 
this disease. We present a comprehensive analysis of the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2017 on gout burden estimates for 195 countries or territories 
between 1990 and 2017.
METHODS: Age-standardized prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years of gout 
were reported between 1990 and 2017 in 195 countries and territories, and 
associations between these estimates and sociodemographic index (SDI) were 
further explored. Total and annual percent change between 1990 and 2017 were 
calculated to quantify the time trends of gout burden.
RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence rates (95% uncertainty interval) per 100 
000 persons were 790.90 (706.10-881.90) and 253.49 (225.69-284.02) in 2017 in 
males and females, respectively. The annual percent change in age-standardized 
prevalence (males, 0.22%; females, 0.38%) and disability-adjusted life-years 
(males, 0.21%; females, 0.38%) of gout increased every year from 1990 to 2017, 
globally. The highest increase was detected in high-SDI countries, especially in 
high-income North America. A non-linear association was observed between burden 
of gout and SDI, with the lowest estimates of gout burden when SDI value was 
about 0.6. High BMI was the leading risk factor for the burden of gout.
CONCLUSION: These study results suggest a globally rising trajectory of gout 
burden between 1990 and 2017. More effective interventions, such as detailed and 
intensive dietary managements and other prevention strategies for reducing 
obesity, should be carried out to reverse this trend, especially in females and 
high-SDI countries.

The Cel genes from Bacillus licheniformis MSB03 were cloned and expressed to 
investigate binding ability on clay minerals and sea sand at pH ranging 3 to 9. 
FTIR analysis has been done to characterize bound enzymes on clay minerals. 
Subsequent, surveying of NCBI database for extracellular enzymes of soil 
bacteria was carried out. Among the five cloned Cel enzymes assayed for binding 
to clay minerals, only Cel5H enzyme had the binding ability. Enzyme Cel5H 
exhibited highest binding to montmorillonite followed by kaolinite and sea sand. 
Interestingly, Cel5H had higher pI value of 9.24 than other proteins (5.2-5.7). 
Cel5H binding to montmorillonite was shown to be negatively affected below pH 3 
and above pH 9. Infrared absorption spectra of the Cel5H-montmorillonite 
complexes showed distinct peaks for clay minerals and bound proteins. 
Furthermore, database survey of soil bacterial extracellular enzymes revealed 
that Bacillus species enzymes had higher pI than other soil bacterial enzymes.

OBJECTIVE: This study sets an example of an economic evaluation of a model 
dengue vaccination strategy for Sri Lanka, following a mandatory pre-vaccination 
screening strategy.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was developed to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of a predicted dengue vaccination strategy over a time 
horizon of 10 years. The cost effectiveness of dengue vaccination strategy for 
seropositive individuals was estimated in terms of incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) (cost per additional quality adjusted life-year 
[QALY]). District-specific ICER values and the budget impact for dengue vaccine 
were estimated with appropriate sensitivity analyses, also taking the 
variability of the pre-vaccination screening test performance into 
consideration.
RESULTS: The ICER for the predicted vaccination strategy following 
pre-vaccination screening was 4,382 USD/QALY for Sri Lanka. There was a 
significant regional variation in vaccine cost effectiveness. The disaggregated 
regional incidence of dengue and the need to perform pre-vaccination screening 
affects the cost effectiveness estimates significantly, where a safer version of 
the vaccine has the potential to become cost saving in high incidence districts.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of the predicted dengue vaccination strategy 
following pre-vaccination screening showed a significant regional variation 
across the districts of Sri Lanka. District-wise disease incidence and the need 
for pre-vaccination screening was found to be the most significant factors 
affecting the cost effectiveness of the vaccine.

AIM: Advance care planning (ACP) is a strategy to align future care and 
treatment with preferences of patients and families. This study assesses the 
experiences of ACP among paediatricians caring for children with life-limiting 
conditions.
METHODS: Paediatricians from five Dutch university hospitals and the national 
oncology centre completed a survey during May to September 2017, which 
investigated experiences with ACP in their most recent case of a deceased child 
and with ACP in general.
RESULTS: A total of 207 paediatricians responded (36%). After exclusion of 
responses with insufficient data (n = 39), 168 were analysed (29%). These 
included experiences with an individual case in 86%. ACP themes were discussed 
with parents in all cases. Topics common to many cases were diagnosis, life 
expectancy, care goals, the parent's fears and code status. ACP conversations 
occurred with children in 23% of cases. The joy in living was the most frequent 
topic. The frequency of ACP conversations was insufficient according to 49% of 
the respondents. In 60%, it was stated that ACP has to result in a documented 
code status.
CONCLUSION: Paediatricians reported having ACP conversations mainly with parents 
focusing on medical issues. There was limited insight into the child's 
preferences for care and treatment.

BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are at increased risk of 
secondary health conditions, reduced quality of life and life expectancy. 
Children with ID demonstrate low levels of physical activity in association with 
a higher prevalence of obesity, a modifiable risk factor associated with 
secondary health conditions including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease. Despite this, physical activity interventions addressing weight and 
weight-related complications in this population are limited. This study aimed to 
establish the feasibility of a school-based group exercise intervention for 
children with moderate to severe ID.
METHODS: A single-arm intervention study was used to establish the feasibility 
of a 16-week exercise intervention. Children attending a School for Specific 
Purposes in Sydney, Australia, participated in two 30-min exercise sessions per 
week across the intervention period in addition to their regular physical 
education class. Each exercise session was 60% aerobically based, 20% strength 
based and 20% targeted towards fundamental movement skill development. We used 
two facilitation strategies to assist the delivery of the intervention, 
including the implementation of a variety of communication resources and 
promotion of social interaction. Feasibility was assessed through recruitment 
rates, program retention, adverse effects, attendance, group size feasibility 
and non-compliance. Anthropometric measures included height (m), weight (kg) and 
waist circumference (cm; umbilicus), with body mass index (BMI) and 
waist-to-height ratios (WtHR) used to determine cardio-metabolic risk. Aerobic 
capacity was assessed using the submaximal 6-min walk test (6-MWT). Intensity of 
physical activity sessions was measured through the use of tri-axial 
accelerometers and compared to physical activity recommendations.
RESULTS: Ten children aged between 9 and 13 years completed the 16-week 
intervention, with a 55% recruitment rate, 91% program retention, 86% attendance 
and with no adverse effects reported. Sessions commenced as 1:1 supervisor to 
child ratios before progressing to established small groups of 2:7 
(supervisor : child). Children spent 38.4% (11.5 min) of each session in 
moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), equating to 20% of their MVPA 
recommended daily physical activity levels (twice per week). There was a 
significant change in weight across the intervention period, with a trend 
towards increased weight between mid-intervention and 3-month follow-up time 
points. There were no significant changes in child BMI, WtHR or aerobic 
capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: A school-based group exercise intervention for children with 
moderate to severe ID is feasible and safe, with high retention rates and 
physical activity participation. No significant improvements in body composition 
or aerobic capacity were determined. The present study demonstrates that 
engaging children with moderate-severe ID in school-based group exercise is 
feasible to assist in physical activity participation.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to assess functional capacity and 
determine the factors associated with functional decline in the elderly in adult 
day care centres and home care support in the County of Coimbra, Portugal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study. A total of 115 participants of both 
genders, aged between 65 and 98, were enrolled in the home care support and 
adult day care system of the County of Coimbra, Portugal. Functional capacity 
was assessed using the Barthel index and the Lawton index. Another questionnaire 
gathered social, demographic and health status information.
RESULTS: The basic activities of daily living were significantly associated with 
age, cohabitation, medication usage, falls and multiple morbidity. Analysis of 
the study's variables and the instrumental activities of daily living found 
significant associations between age, institutional affiliation, perceived 
health status, hospitalizations, medication usage, physical exercise, multiple 
morbidities, falls, and fall prevention.
DISCUSSION: The results demonstrate that no statistically observable differences 
were found between gender and functional dependence. A significant association 
between the Barthel index and cohabitation was also found. We should also 
highlight that this sample revealed the extremely important role of families in 
determining the protection of highly dependent older people. Likewise, a 
significant association was observed between instrumental activities of daily 
living and levels of physical activity in which greater independence was found 
in those seniors who practiced physical exercise three or more times per week.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study allow us to identify factors that may be 
associated with the functional decline in the elderly. Useful evidence for the 
adoption of intervention strategies in the elderly population was added, focused 
on the prevention of functional decline and maintenance of the functional 
capacities of the elderly.
