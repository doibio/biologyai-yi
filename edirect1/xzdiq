This systematic review aimed to comprehensively synthesize cost-effectiveness 
evidences of bariatric surgery by pooling incremental net monetary benefits 
(INB). Twenty-eight full economic evaluation studies comparing bariatric surgery 
with usual care were identified from five databases. In high-income countries 
(HICs), bariatric surgery was cost-effective among mixed obesity group (i.e., 
obesity with/without diabetes) over a 10-year time horizon (pooled INB = 
$53,063.69; 95% CI $42,647.96, $63,479.43) and lifetime horizon (pooled INB = 
$101,897.96; 95% CI $79,390.93, $124,404.99). All studies conducted among obese 
with diabetes reported that bariatric surgery was cost-effective. Also, the 
pooled INB for obesity with diabetes group over lifetime horizon in HICs was 
$80,826.28 (95% CI $32,500.75, $129,151.81). Nevertheless, no evidence is 
available in low- and middle-income countries.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common immune mediated disorder 
of the central nervous system (CNS). This study compares the worldwide 
occurrence and epidemiologic burden of MS in the Middle East and Northern Africa 
(MENA) region and Western Europe from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: This study used data from the global burden of disease (GBD) studies. 
Initially, all age and age-specific values were estimated and then, these values 
were compared among the mentioned areas. In addition, the changes of sex 
distribution of MS according to incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) were calculated. The trend of MS incidence was also compared 
among the MENA region countries.
RESULTS: According to MS incidence per 100,000 populations during 1990 to 2017, 
the occurrence of new cases has decreased slightly in the world (from 0.7 to 
0.65) and Western Europe (from 2.55 to 2.50). Except Iran with a sharp rise of 2 
to 2.8, there was a slow increase in the MENA region (from 0.9 to 1). The MS 
prevalence, between 1990 and 2017, in all ages was stable in the world and the 
MENA region except a steady increase in Iran and highest value in Western 
Europe. In this study, we determined the age-specific incidence of MS in all 
regions from 1990 to 2017. Although data showed a different trend of changes 
between age groups and regions, the group age 25-29 years had the highest risk 
of MS incidence. Based on gender, the incidence, prevalence, and DALY of MS in 
all regions were higher in female.
CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2017, Western Europe had the highest MS prevalence and 
the MENA region had a relatively stable trend for MS incidence. In particular, 
in Iran, the MS incidence has been constantly increasing and has surpassed 
Western Europe since 2013.

Dependency care is a real public health issue. The lengthening of life 
expectancy and the increase in polypathologies require health policies that are 
as close as possible to the needs of the elderly. The World Health Organisation 
has set up a program to encourage healthy ageing. Based on this program, the 
Toulouse gerontopôle has developed digital tools for the prevention, evaluation, 
monitoring and management of ageing in order to detect and monitor 200,000 
elderly people in Occitania within five years.

Degenerative mitral valve disease represents the most common cause of mitral 
regurgitation in industrialized countries. When left untreated, patients with 
severe degenerative mitral regurgitation show a poor clinical outcome. 
Conversely, a timely and appropriate correction provides a restored life 
expectancy and a good quality of life. Therefore, in this scenario, surgical 
mitral valve repair represents the gold standard of treatment. This review aims 
to analyze the indications, timing, and contemporary surgical techniques of 
mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation. Moreover, the value 
of heart team approach and centers of excellence for mitral valve repair are 
also deeply discussed.

OBJECTIVE: The GETSET trial found that guided graded exercise self-help (GES) 
improved fatigue and physical functioning more than specialist medical care 
(SMC) alone in adults with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) 12 weeks after 
randomisation. In this paper, we assess the longer-term clinical and health 
economic outcomes.
METHODS: GETSET was a randomised controlled trial of 211 UK secondary care 
patients with CFS. Primary outcomes were the Chalder fatigue questionnaire and 
the physical functioning subscale of the short-form-36 survey. Postal 
questionnaires assessed the primary outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the 
intervention 12 months after randomisation. Service costs and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) were combined in a cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS: Between January 2014 and March 2016, 164 (78%) participants returned 
questionnaires 15 months after randomisation. Results showed no main effect of 
intervention arm on fatigue (chi2(1) = 4.8, p = 0.03) or physical functioning 
(chi2(1) = 1.3, p = 0.25), adjusting for multiplicity. No other intervention arm 
or time*arm effect was significant. The short-term fatigue reduction was 
maintained at long-term follow-up for participants assigned to GES, with 
improved fatigue from short- to long-term follow up after SMC, such that the 
groups no longer differed. Healthcare costs were £85 higher for GES and produced 
more QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £4802 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term improvements after GES were maintained at long-term 
follow-up, with further improvement in the SMC group such that the groups no 
longer differed at long-term follow-up. The cost per QALY for GES compared to 
SMC alone was below the usual threshold indicating cost-effectiveness, but with 
uncertainty around the result.

Breast cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies. The aim of the article 
is to analyse the cost-utility ratio and budgetary impact of talazoparib 
treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic gBRCA + breast cancer 
from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. Analyses were based 
on the EMBRACA clinical trial and the model was constructed according to 
"partitioned survival analysis". Two scenarios were considered in order to 
compare talazoparib with the alternatives of capecitabine, vinorelbine and 
eribulin: 1. Chemotherapy in patients pre-treated with anthracyclines/taxanes 
and, 2. A second- and subsequent-line treatment option. Treatment types 
following relapse were recorded in the mentioned clinical trial. The 
effectiveness measure used was quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The average 
health cost of patients treated at 43 months with talazoparib was 84,360.86€, 
whilst current treatment costs were 26,683.90€. The effectiveness of talazoparib 
was 1.93 years of survival (1.09 QALY) relative to 1.58 years (0.83 QALY) in the 
treatment group. The incremental cost-utility ratio was 252,420.04€/QALY. This 
represents the additional cost required to earn an additional QALY when changing 
from regular treatment to talazoparib. Regarding budgetary impact, the number of 
patients susceptible to receiving treatment with between 94 and 202 talazoparib 
was estimated, according to scenario and likelihood. The 3-year cost difference 
was between 6.9 and 9 million euros. The economic evaluation conducted shows an 
elevated incremental cost-utility ratio and budgetary impact. Taking these 
results into account, the price of talazoparib would have to be lower than that 
taken as a reference to reach the cost-utility thresholds.

INTRODUCTION: At the end of life, patients with advanced cancer and their 
informal caregivers may confront multiple existential concerns. Despite the 
strong potential to alleviate existential distress through psychosocial 
interventions, existential distress and its impact on healthcare outcomes have 
not yet been studied systematically. We aim to investigate the frequency, 
longitudinal trajectory and predictive impact of existential distress on 
end-of-life outcomes. We further aim to determine patients' and caregivers' 
specific need for and utilisation of psychosocial support for existential 
distress.
METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study will consecutively recruit 500 patients 
with advanced cancer and 500 caregivers from oncological outpatient and 
inpatient clinics. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires 
(sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics, existential distress, 
end-of-life outcomes, resources and support needs) at five points of assessment 
(at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). At baseline and 6-month 
follow-up, we will conduct structured diagnostic interviews to assess mental 
disorders. Statistical analyses will include descriptive statistics to determine 
the prevalence of existential distress, mental disorders and end-of-life 
outcomes; multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to calculate the 
predictive impact of existential distress on end-of-life outcomes; and growth 
mixture models to analyse longitudinal trajectories of existential distress.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide comprehensive knowledge about patients' and 
caregivers' existential concerns. The longitudinal empirical data will allow for 
conclusions concerning the frequency and course of existential distress 
throughout 1 year. This important extension of existing cross-sectional research 
will contribute to further develop targeted psychosocial interventions. Profiles 
of existential distress may be applied by clinicians from multiple professions 
and help to address existential concerns effectively.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the institutional research 
ethics committee (reference number LPEK-0177). Results will be presented at 
scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Other forms of 
dissemination will include sharing results on the psychometric properties of the 
structured demoralisation interview with international research groups and 
communication with healthcare professionals providing psychosocial treatment for 
patients and caregivers. Following scientific standards, our progress will be 
regularly updated on ClinicalTrials.gov.

OBJECTIVES: Interventions to prevent childhood respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
disease are limited and costly. New interventions are in advanced stages of 
development and could be available soon. This study aims to evaluate the 
potential impact and cost-effectiveness of two interventions to prevent 
childhood RSV-a maternal vaccine and a monoclonal antibody (mAb).
DESIGN: Using a static population-based cohort model, we evaluate impact and 
cost-effectiveness of RSV interventions, from a health systems perspective. The 
assumed baseline efficacy and duration of protection were higher for the mAb 
(60%-70% efficacy, protection 6 months) compared with the maternal vaccine 
(40%-60% efficacy, protection 3 months). Both interventions were evaluated at 
US$3 and US$5 per dose for Gavi and non-Gavi countries, respectively. A range of 
input values were considered to explore uncertainty.
SETTINGS: 131 low-income and middle-income countries.
PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women and live birth cohorts.
INTERVENTIONS: Maternal vaccine given to pregnant women and mAb given to young 
infants.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life years averted, 
severe case averted, deaths averted, incremental cost effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, maternal vaccine and mAbs were projected to 
avert 25% and 55% of RSV-related deaths among infants younger than 6 months of 
age, respectively. The average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per 
disability-adjusted life year averted was US$1342 (range US$800-US$1866) for 
maternal RSV vaccine and US$431 (range US$167-US$692) for mAbs. At a 50% gross 
domestic product per capita threshold, maternal vaccine and mAbs were 
cost-effective in 60 and 118 countries, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Both interventions are projected to be impactful and cost-effective 
in many countries, a finding that would be enhanced if country-specific Gavi 
cofinancing to eligible countries were included. mAbs, with assumed higher 
efficacy and duration of protection, are expected to be more cost-effective than 
RSV maternal vaccines at similar prices. Final product characteristics will 
influence this finding.

With improved survival of childhood, adolescent, and young adult (CAYA) cancer, 
the European survivor population of 300,000-500,000 continues to expand. Most 
survivors will experience at least one and often multiple cancer- and 
treatment-related late effects throughout their lives, including endocrine 
toxicities. Besides affecting their physical and psychosocial health status, 
these might reduce life expectancy and quality of life. Prevalent endocrine 
complications include hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, central precocious 
puberty, primary thyroid, male or female gonadal dysfunction, metabolic 
syndrome, and low bone mineral density. Long-term follow-up (LTFU) care, 
including education, risk-based prevention, and surveillance strategies, is 
essential to reduce the burden of endocrine complications and to allow for 
timely interventions. To integrate scientific expert knowledge, evidence-based 
clinical practice guidelines have been developed by the International Late 
Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) and PanCare. 
These guide LTFU care by describing risk populations and preferred surveillance 
modalities. Moreover, consensus-based recommendations have been developed by 
PanCareFollowUp where evidence-based guidance is still awaited. The 
PanCareSurFup models of care guidelines recommend multidisciplinary team care at 
or under guidance of a cancer survivorship expert center, so CAYA cancer 
survivors receive appropriate care and support to optimize health.

BACKGROUND: Nearly one in ten children is born preterm. The degree of immaturity 
is a determinant of the infant's health. Extremely preterm infants have higher 
morbidity and mortality than term infants. One disease affecting extremely 
preterm infants is retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a multifactorial 
neurovascular disease that can lead to retinal detachment and blindness. The 
advances in omics technology have opened up possibilities to study protein 
expressions thoroughly with clinical accuracy, here used to increase the 
understanding of protein expression in relation to immaturity and ROP.
METHODS: Longitudinal serum protein profiles the first months after birth in 14 
extremely preterm infants were integrated with perinatal and ROP data. In total, 
448 unique protein targets were analyzed using Proximity Extension Assays.
RESULTS: We found 20 serum proteins associated with gestational age and/or ROP 
functioning within mainly angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, bone regulation, immune 
function, and lipid metabolism. Infants with severe ROP had persistent lower 
levels of several identified proteins during the first postnatal months.
CONCLUSIONS: The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship 
between longitudinal serum protein levels and immaturity and abnormal retinal 
neurovascular development. This is essential for understanding 
pathophysiological mechanisms and to optimize diagnosis, treatment and 
prevention for ROP.
IMPACT: Longitudinal protein profiles of 14 extremely preterm infants were 
analyzed using a novel multiplex protein analysis platform combined with 
perinatal data. Proteins associated with gestational age at birth and the 
neurovascular disease ROP were identified. Among infants with ROP, longitudinal 
levels of the identified proteins remained largely unchanged during the first 
postnatal months. The main functions of the proteins identified were 
angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, immune function, bone regulation, lipid metabolism, 
and central nervous system development. The study contributes to the 
understanding of longitudinal serum protein patterns related to gestational age 
and their association with abnormal retinal neuro-vascular development.

AIM: The Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT) 
showed that tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related 
hospitalizations in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy 
(ATTR-CM). This study aimed to estimate the impact of tafamidis on survival and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A multi-state, cohort, Markov model was developed to 
simulate the disease course of ATTR-CM throughout a lifetime. For survival 
extrapolation, survival curves were fitted by treatment arm and New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) Class I/II (68% of patients) and NYHA Class III (32% of 
patients) cohorts using the individual patient-level data from both the ATTR-ACT 
and the corresponding long-term extension study. Univariate and multivariate 
sensitivity analyses were conducted. The predicted mean survival for the total 
population (NYHA Class I/II + III) was 6.73 years for tafamidis and 2.85 years 
for the standard of care (SoC), resulting in an incremental mean survival of 
3.88 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-5.66]. Of the 6.73 life-years, 
patients on tafamidis spend, on average, 4.82 years in NYHA Class I/II, while 
patients on SoC spend an average of 1.60 life-years in these classes. The 
combination of longer survival in lower NYHA classes produced a QALY gain of 
5.39 for tafamidis and 2.11 for SoC, resulting in 3.29 incremental QALYs (95% CI 
1.21-4.74) in favour of tafamidis.
CONCLUSION: Based on the disease simulation model results, tafamidis is expected 
to more than double the life expectancy and QALYs of ATTR-CM patients compared 
to SoC. Longer-term follow-up data from the ATTR-ACT extension study will 
further inform these findings.

Arab Gulf Cooperation Council countries are considered as one of the most 
regions exhibiting a high prevalence of diabetes including the kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and United Arab of Emirates, which have 
similar population characteristics (for example, religion, language, lifestyle, 
diet, and income). The frequency rate of diabetes in these countries ranged from 
8 to 22% according to the last International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report. 
Many factors impact the prevalence in this region including obesity, unhealthy 
lifestyle, increased life expectancy, increased healthcare expenditures, 
increased the incidence of type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) among children and 
young persons, and genetic susceptibility. This study aims to review the 
published papers on the incidence of T2DM and explore the most reasons behind 
elevated incidence of T2DM in these countries.

BACKGROUND: Aquatic exercise can improve strength, flexibility, and aerobic 
function while safely providing partial weight-bearing support through viscosity 
and buoyancy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of 
water-based exercise with land-based exercise before and after a 10-week 
exercise intervention and again at one-year follow-up.
METHODS: Eighty participants aged 65 years and older were randomly assigned to 
either a water- or a land-based 10-week exercise program. Assessment included 
the Senior Fitness Test (SFT), the Modified Falls-Efficacy Scale, and the 
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Hip and knee strength was also 
measured. All assessments were completed at three time points: pre- (T1), post- 
(T2), and at 1-year follow-up (T3).
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the two groups on three 
parameters: the SFT timed up-and-go test; lower hip muscle strength in 
extension, adduction, and external rotation; and quality of life (QoL) measured 
by the SF-36 (p< 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the SFT 
chair stand test, dominant arm curl test, two-minute step test, chair 
sit-and-reach test, back scratch test, and Modified Falls-Efficacy Scale.
CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise provided greater improvement of physical health and 
QoL among older people than land-based exercise.

Spirulina platensis is having high nutritive value due to pigments such as 
chlorophyll-a, phycobiliproteins (especially phycocyanins) and carotenoids. In 
our present work, C-phycocyanin (C-PC) was extracted from dry biomass of 
Spirulina platensis. C-PC being heat sensitive, reiterates the need for 
additional protection during drying (micro encapsulation). Accordingly, a novel 
method employing aqueous two phase systems (ATPSs) as carrier materials to 
achieve double encapsulation was studied for the first time. PEG 4000/Potassium 
phosphate and PEG 6000/Dextran were used at already standardized tie line 
length, at different volume ratios (by varying the total phase composition). 
ATPS at each volume ratio acted as different carrier materials offering varied 
degree of heat protection during double encapsulation while maltodextrin, being 
the conventional carrier material, was used for comparison. The best results of 
spray dried powders using PEG (4% w/w)/Potassium phosphate salt (18%, w/w) and 
PEG (6%)/Dextran (10%, w/w) phase systems as carrier materials were compared 
with conventional encapsulation (MDX as a carrier material) and freeze dying as 
control. PEG/Dextran as a carrier material with volume ratio of 0.25 resulted in 
the highest retention of blue colour (b*value), purity (0.43) as well as yield 
(YEP) of 94.99% w/w of C-PC, which could be stored for 6 months without much 
reduction from initial powder characteristics. From the overall results, it can 
be concluded that ATPS can be used as an effective carrier material for double 
encapsulation of biomolecules such as C-PC with additional benefit of enhancing 
the purity.

Sleep is not considered a pathological state, but it consumes a third of 
conscious human life. This share is much more than most optimistic life 
extension forecasts that biotechnologies or experimental and medical 
interventions can offer. Are there insurmountable physical or biological 
limitations to reducing the duration of sleep? How far can it be avoided without 
fatal consequences? What means can reduce the length of sleep? It is widely 
accepted that sleep is necessary for long-term survival. Here we review the 
limited yet intriguing evidence that is not consistent with this notion. We 
concentrate on clinical cases of complete and partial loss of sleep and on human 
mutations that result in a short sleep phenotype. These observations are 
supported by new animal studies and are discussed from the perspective of sleep 
evolution. Two separate hypotheses suggest distinct approaches for remodeling 
our sleep machinery. If sleep serves an unidentified vital physiological 
function, this indispensable function has to be identified before "sleep 
prosthesis" (technical, biological, or chemical) can be developed. If sleep has 
no vital function, but rather represents a timing mechanism for adaptive 
inactivity, sleep could be reduced by forging the sleep generation system 
itself, with no adverse effects.

In patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, awaiting liver 
transplantation, current guidelines by AASLD and ESMO recommend a bridging 
therapy with a loco-regional treatment to prevent progression outside 
transplantation criteria. The standard of care in delaying disease progression 
has been recognized to be the transarterial chemoembolization. Permanent 
occlusion of tumor feeding vessels has effects on tumour stromal 
microenvironment by inducing intra- and intercellular signaling processes 
counteracting hypoxia, such as the release of vascular endothelial growth 
factor, a promoter of neoangiogenesis, tumour proliferation and metastatic 
growth. Among chemoembolization interventions, TACE with degradable starch 
microspheres represents an alternative to conventional cTACE and DEB-TACE and it 
minimizes detrimental effects on tumour stromal microenvironment, guaranteeing a 
transient occlusion of tumour feeding arteries and avoiding VEGF 
overexpression.Between January 2015 and September 2020, 54 consecutive patients 
with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh stage B, who had 
undergone DSM-TACE as a bridging therapy while awaiting liver transplantation, 
were eligible for the study. A total of 154 DSM-TACE was performed, with a mean 
number of 2.85 procedures per patient. 18 patients (33.3%) succeeded in 
achieving liver transplantation, with a mean waiting time-to-transplantation of 
11.7 months. The cumulative rates of patients still active on the WL at 6 months 
were about 91 and 93% when considering overall drop-out and tumour-specific 
drop-out respectively. Overall survival was about 96% at 6 months and 92% at 12 
months. 17 patients experienced adverse events after the chemoembolizations. For 
patients with HCC in the transplant waiting list and within the Child-Pugh B 
stage, life expectancy may be dominated by the liver dysfunction, rather than by 
the tumour progression itself. In this population subset, the choice of LRT is 
critical because LRT itself could become a dangerous tool that is likely to 
precipitate liver dysfunction to an extent that survival is shortened rather 
than prolonged. Hence, the current study demonstrates that DSM-TACE is not far 
from being an ideal LRT, because it has an excellent safety profile, maintaining 
an efficacy that guarantees a clear advantage on the dropout rate with respect 
to the non-operative strategy, thus justifying its use.

According to the EASL Guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, 
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is the first-line treatment recommended 
for intermediate-stage HCC. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that patients 
beyond the Milan criteria can be considered for a liver transplant after 
successful downstaging to within the Milan criteria. Response to downstaging 
treatments significantly influences not just drop-outs, but also the rate of 
post-transplantation tumor recurrences. TACE with degradable starch microspheres 
represents an alternative to conventional TACE with lipiodol and TACE with 
drug-eluting beads, and it leads to transient arterial occlusion allowing lower 
activation of hypoxia-inducible factors and less release of vascular endothelial 
growth factor, a promoter of neoangiogenesis, tumor proliferation, and 
metastatic growth. In patients with intermediate-stage HCC and a Child-Pugh 
score of 8 or 9, life expectancy may be dominated by cirrhotic liver 
dysfunction, rather than by the tumor progression itself; hence, locoregional 
treatments might also be detrimental, precipitating liver dysfunction to an 
extent that survival is shortened rather than prolonged. Data on tolerability, 
toxicity, and effectiveness of DSM-TACE are limited but encouraging. Between 
January 2015 and October 2020, 50 consecutive patients with intermediate-stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma and a Child-Pugh score of 8/9, who had undergone 
DSM-TACE as the first-line treatment, were eligible for the study. A total of 
142 DSM-TACEs were performed, with a mean number of 2.84 procedures per patient. 
The mean time-to-downstaging was 19.2 months, with six patients successfully 
downstaged. OS was about 100% at six months, 81.8% at 12 months, and 50% at 
24 months. Twenty-two patients experienced adverse events after 
chemoembolization. The median OS and safety of DSM-TACE in this study are 
comparable with other published investigations in this field. Furthermore, 12% 
of patients were successfully downstaged. Hence, the results of the current 
investigation demonstrate that DSM-TACE is effective and safe in 
intermediate-stage HCC, achieving an interesting downstaging rate. Such data 
were observed in the population subset with a Child-Pugh score of 8 or 9, in 
which life expectancy may be determined by cirrhotic liver dysfunction, so the 
achievement of a balance between the safety and efficacy profile of the TACE 
treatment is crucial.

Background: Neurological impairment (NI) and disability are associated with 
reduced life expectancy, but the risk and magnitude of premature mortality in 
children vary considerably across study settings. We conducted a systematic 
review to estimate the magnitude of premature mortality following 
childhood-onset NI worldwide and to summarize known risk factors and causes of 
death. Methods: We searched various databases for published studies from their 
inception up to 31st October 2020. We included all cohort studies that assessed 
the overall risk of mortality in individuals with childhood-onset epilepsy, 
intellectual disability (ID), and deficits in hearing, vision and motor 
functions. Comparative measures of mortality such as the standardized mortality 
ratio (SMR), risk factors and causes were synthesized quantitatively under each 
domain of impairment. This review is registered on the PROSPERO database 
(registration number CRD42019119239). Results: The search identified 2,159 
studies, of which 24 studies were included in the final synthesis. Twenty-two 
(91.7%) studies originated from high-income countries (HICs). The median SMR was 
higher for epilepsy compared with ID (7.1 [range 3.1-22.4] vs. 2.9 [range 
2.0-11.6]). In epilepsy, mortality was highest among younger age groups, 
comorbid neurological disorders, generalized seizures (at univariable levels), 
untreatable epilepsy, soon after diagnosis and among cases with 
structural/metabolic types, but there were no differences by sex. Most deaths 
(87.5%) were caused by non-epilepsy-related causes. For ID, mortality was 
highest in younger age groups and girls had a higher risk compared to the 
general population. Important risk factors for premature mortality were 
severe-to-profound severity, congenital disorders e.g., Down Syndrome, comorbid 
neurological disorders and adverse pregnancy and perinatal events. Respiratory 
infections and comorbid neurological disorders were the leading causes of death 
in ID. Mortality is infrequently examined in impairments of vision, hearing and 
motor functions. Summary: The risk of premature mortality is elevated in 
individuals with childhood-onset NI, particularly in epilepsy and lower in ID, 
with a need for more studies for vision, hearing, and motor impairments. 
Survival in NI could be improved through interventions targeting modifiable risk 
factors and underlying causes.

Immune checkpoint blockade therapies, especially those targeting the programmed 
death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have achieved impressive 
clinical responses in multiple types of cancers. To optimize the therapeutic 
effect of the checkpoint antibodies, many strategies including targeting 
delivery, controlled release, and cellular synthesis have been developed. 
However, within these strategies, antibodies were attached to drug carriers by 
chemical bonding, which may affect the steric configuration and function of the 
antibodies. Herein, we prepared cluster of differentiation 64 (CD64), a natural 
catcher of the fragment crystalline (Fc) of monomeric immunoglobulin G (IgG), 
and over-expressed it on the cell membrane nanovesicles (NVs) as PD-L1 antibody 
delivery vehicle (CD64-NVs-aPD-L1), which was employed to disrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 
immunosuppressive signal axis for boosting T cell dependent tumor elimination. 
Meanwhile, chemical immunomodulatory drug cyclophosphamide (CP) was also 
encapsulated in the vesicle (CD64-NVs-aPD-L1-CP), to simultaneously restrain the 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) and invigorate Ki67+CD8+ T cells, then further 
enhance their anti-tumor ability. Methods: The cell membrane NVs overexpressing 
CD64 were incubated with PD-L1 antibody and chemotherapeutic agent CP to prepare 
CD64-NVs-aPD-L1-CP. Results: The CD64-NVs-aPD-L1-CP could simultaneously 
interrupt the immunosuppressive effect of PD-L1 and decrease the inhibition of 
Tregs, leading to tumor growth suppression and survival time extension. 
Conclusion: CD64-NVs are charismatic carriers to achieve both checkpoint 
blockade and immunomodulatory drugs for combined cancer immunotherapy.
