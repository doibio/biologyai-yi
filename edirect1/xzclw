OBJECTIVES: A short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of two 
pedometer-based walking interventions compared with usual care.
DESIGN: (A) Short-term CEA: parallel three-arm cluster randomised trial 
randomised by household. (B) Long-term CEA: Markov decision model.
SETTING: Seven primary care practices in South London, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: (A) Short-term CEA: 1023 people (922 households) aged 45-75 years 
without physical activity (PA) contraindications. (b) Long-term CEA: a cohort of 
100 000 people aged 59-88 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Pedometers, 12-week walking programmes and PA diaries delivered 
by post or through three PA consultations with practice nurses.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Accelerometer-measured change (baseline 
to 12 months) in average daily step count and time in 10 min bouts of moderate 
to vigorous PA (MVPA), and EQ-5D-5L quality-adjusted life-years (QALY).
METHODS: Resource use costs (£2013/2014) from a National Health Service 
perspective, presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each outcome 
over a 1-year and lifetime horizon, with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves 
and willingness to pay per QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses evaluate uncertainty.
RESULTS: (A) Short-term CEA: At 12 months, incremental cost was £3.61 (£109)/min 
in ≥10 min MVPA bouts for nurse support compared with control (postal group). At 
£20 000/QALY, the postal group had a 50% chance of being cost saving compared 
with control. (B) Long-term CEA: The postal group had more QALYs (+759 QALYs, 
95% CI 400 to 1247) and lower costs (-£11 million, 95% CI -12 to -10) than 
control and nurse groups, resulting in an incremental net monetary benefit of 
£26 million per 100 000 population. Results were sensitive to reporting serious 
adverse events, excluding health service use, and including all participant 
costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Postal delivery of a pedometer intervention in primary care is 
cost-effective long term and has a 50% chance of being cost-effective, through 
resource savings, within 1 year. Further research should ascertain maintenance 
of the higher levels of PA, and its impact on quality of life and health service 
use.

Quality of life of patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) temporally deteriorates and recovers over several years. 
We retrospectively evaluate the impact of chronic graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD) and glucocorticoid on physical recovery. We included 162 patients who 
underwent their first allogeneic HSCT between October 2010 and December 2015 in 
a single hospital. All patients are planned to undergo physical function tests 
before and 1, 3, 12 months after allogeneic HSCT. Scores of knee extension 
strength and distance covered in the 6-min walk test (6MWT) recovered at the 
12-month assessment. Both chronic GVHD and high dose glucocorticoid were 
associated with delayed recovery of body mass index (BMI), hand grip strength, 
knee extension strength, and duration of standing on one foot. Lung GVHD and 
high dose glucocorticoid had negative impact on the distance covered in the 
6MWT. A multivariate analysis revealed that chronic GVHD and glucocorticoid was 
an independent risk factor for decreased BMI and delayed recovery of muscle 
strength, respectively. Our results suggest that high-risk patients who have 
chronic GVHD or who receive glucocorticoid therapy may require reduced dose of 
glucocorticoid and long-term physical support to recover physical function after 
transplantation.

AIM: With the increase in life expectancy, it has become necessary to expand our 
knowledge of how older individuals perceive their own ageing and how ageing 
affects their quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine older 
adults' attitudes towards ageing and the relationship between attitudes and 
quality of life among community-dwelling older adults in Turkey.
METHODS: This cross-sectional and correlational study was conducted in 
Zonguldak, Turkey. The sample included 999 community-dwelling older adults, who 
were selected from five family health centres. The data were collected between 
April and June 2015 by using the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire and the World 
Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Older Adults Module. A 
hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the predictive 
value of attitude to ageing on quality of life.
RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that the subscales of Attitudes 
to Ageing Questionnaire (psychosocial loss (β = -0.289), physical change 
(β = 0.296), and psychological growth (β = 0.279)) were statistically 
significant predictors of quality of life. Attitudes to ageing explained 46.6% 
of the quality of life among community-dwelling older adults in Turkey (R2 
 = 0.466).
CONCLUSION: The significant impact of attitudes to ageing on quality of life 
suggests the need for better recognition of attitudes to ageing in older adults.

Over the past decades, effective cancer therapies have resulted in a significant 
improvement in the survival rates for a number of cancers and an increase in the 
number of cancer survivors. Radiation therapy is widely used in the treatment of 
cancer, and it can induce various cardiotoxicities that differ considerably from 
chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. They occur primarily as late 
radiation-induced complications, several years from the end of anticancer 
treatment and present as coronary artery disease, heart failure, pericardial 
disease, valvular heart disease and arrhythmias. Patients who recovered from 
cancer disease suffer from cardiac complications of anticancer treatment, it 
affects the quality of their lives and life expectancy, especially if the 
diagnosis is delayed. These patients may present distinct symptoms of cardiac 
injury, resulting from radiation-induced neurotoxicity and altered pain 
perception, which makes diagnosis difficult. This review highlights the need for 
a screening programme for patients who have undergone radiation therapy and 
which will subsequently have a potentially profound impact on morbidity and 
mortality.

An absolute decline in US life expectancy in low education whites has alarmed 
policy makers and attracted media attention. Depending on which studies are 
correct, low education white women have lost between 3 and 5 years of lifespan; 
men, between 6 months and 3 years. Although absolute declines in life expectancy 
are relatively rare, some commentators see the public alarm as reflecting a 
racist concern for white lives over black ones. How ought we ethically to 
evaluate this lifespan contraction in low education whites? Should we care, or 
is it racist to care? Does it constitute an injustice or reflect justice being 
done? I argue that the lifespan contraction in low education whites violates key 
normative criteria used to make determinations of health justice, and that these 
judgments do not vitiate concerns about racism. I conclude with reflections on 
US population health policy and building an inclusive health equity movement.

OBJECTIVE: As endothelial dysfunction is an early event in atherosclerosis 
formation, we investigated if proteins previously related to cardiovascular 
disease also were related to endothelial function using a novel targeted 
proteomics approach.
METHODS: In the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors 
(PIVUS) study (n = 850-970, all aged 70 years), endothelium-dependent 
vasodilation (EDV) in the forearm was assessed by intra-arterial infusion of 
acetylcholine. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) was investigated in the brachial 
artery by ultrasound. The same investigations were carried out in the 
Prospective investigation of Obesity, Energy and Metabolism (POEM) study 
(n = 375-461, all aged 50 years). After strict quality control, 84 
cardiovascular-related proteins measured by the proximity extension assay were 
studied in relation to EDV and FMD in PIVUS (discovery sample) and POEM 
(validation sample).
RESULTS: Of the 15 proteins being significantly related to EDV in PIVUS (false 
discovery rate <0.025), seven could be replicated in POEM at nominal 
significance and same effect direction when adjusted for sex and storage time. 
Of those, only cathepsin D remained significant following further adjustment for 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors (beta, -0.08; 95% confidence interval, 
-0.16, -0.01; P = 0.033; change in ln-transformed EDV per 1-SD increase in 
protein level). No protein was significantly related to FMD.
CONCLUSION: Using a discovery/validation approach in two samples, our results 
indicate an inverse association between plasma cathepsin D levels and 
endothelial-dependent vasodilation.

OBJECTIVE: To assess relative clinical and economic performance of the revised 
American Thyroid Association (ATA) thyroid cancer guidelines compared to current 
standard of care.
BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States has tripled whereas 
mortality has only marginally increased. Most patients present with small 
papillary carcinomas and have historically received at least a total 
thyroidectomy as a treatment. In 2015, the ATA released the revised guidelines 
recommending an option for active surveillance (AS) of small papillary thyroid 
carcinoma and thyroid lobectomy for larger unifocal tumors.
METHODS: We created a Markov microsimulation model to evaluate the performance 
of the ATA's 2015 guidelines compared to the ATA's 2009 guidelines. We modeled a 
cohort of simulated patients with demographic and thyroid nodule characteristics 
representative of those presenting clinically in the United States. Outcome 
measures include life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and 
frequency of surgical adverse events.
RESULTS: In our base case analysis, the ATA 2015 strategy dominates the ATA 2009 
strategy. The ATA 2015 strategy delivers greater discounted average 
quality-adjusted life years (13.09 vs 12.43) at a lower discounted average cost 
($14,752 vs $20,126). Deaths due to thyroid cancer under the 2015 strategy are 
higher than the 2009 strategy but this is offset by a reduction in surgical 
deaths, leading to greater average life expectancy under the ATA 2015 strategy. 
The optimal strategy is sensitive to patients who experience a greater decrement 
in quality of life while undergoing AS.
CONCLUSIONS: The ATA 2015 Guidelines represent a cost-effective strategy 
regarding AS and extent of surgery.

Maximum avoidance of inbreeding (MAI) is a mating system, in which mates are as 
distantly related as possible. Although theoretical aspects and applications of 
MAI in diploid populations have been studied by many researchers, extension of 
MAI to haplodiploid populations is an unresolved problem. In this paper, this 
problem is addressed, and the following conclusions are derived. For a 
haplodiploid population with a Fibonacci number of females, a set of mating 
systems (one cycle MAI-hd) to avoid inbreeding to the maximum after one cycle 
practice of the set can be defined. But unlike MAI in diploid populations, 
repetition of one cycle MAI-hd cannot be MAI in the global range of generations. 
Numerical comparison with random mating and circular half-sib mating shows that 
as in diploid populations, repetition of one cycle MAI-hd in haplodiploid 
populations attains a lower inbreeding coefficient in early generations at the 
expense of a higher asymptotic rate of inbreeding.

Verticillium dahliae is a soil-borne phytopathogenic fungus that causes a 
destructive vascular wilt, but details of the molecular mechanism behind its 
pathogenicity are not very clear. Here, we generated a red fluorescent isolate 
of V. dahliae by protoplast transformation to explore its pathogenicity 
mechanism, including colonization, invasion, and extension in Nicotiana 
benthamiana, using confocal microscopy. The nucleotide sequences of mCherry were 
optimized for fungal expression and cloned into pCT-HM plasmid, which was 
inserted into V. dahliae protoplasts. The transformant (Vd-m) shows strong red 
fluorescence and its phenotype, growth rate, and pathogenicity did not differ 
significantly from the wild type V. dahliae (Vd-wt). Between one and three days 
post inoculation (dpi), the Vd-m successfully colonized and invaded epidermal 
cells of the roots. From four to six dpi, hyphae grew on root wounds and lateral 
root primordium and entered xylem vessels. From seven to nine dpi, hyphae 
extended along the surface of the cell wall and massively grew in the xylem 
vessel of roots. At ten dpi, the Vd-m was found in petioles and veins of leaves. 
Our results distinctly showed the pathway of V. dahliae infection and 
colonization in N. benthamiana, and the optimized expression can be used to 
deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanism of pathogenicity.

OBJECTIVE: Adequate physical activity levels and a healthy lifestyle may prevent 
all kinds of non-communicable diseases, promote well-being and reduce 
health-care costs among perimenopausal women. This study assessed an exercise 
programme for perimenopausal women.
METHOD: A total of 150 women (aged 45-64 years) not engaged in regular physical 
activity were randomly assigned to either a 16 week exercise intervention or to 
the control group. The study was conducted from the perspective of the National 
Health System. Health outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
measured by the EuroQol-5D-5L questionnaire. The total direct costs of the 
programme were the costs of visits to primary care, specialty care, emergency, 
medicines, instructor cost and infrastructure cost. The results were expressed 
as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken 
to test the robustness of the analysis.
RESULTS: Mean QALYs over 16 weeks were.228 in the control group and.230 in the 
intervention group (mean difference: .002; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 
-0.005 to 0.009). Improvements from baseline were greater in the intervention 
group in all dimensions of the EuroQol-5D-5L but not statistically significant. 
The total costs at the end of the intervention were 160.38 € in the control 
group and 167.80 € in the intervention group (mean difference: 7.42 €; 95%CI: 
-47 to 62). The exercise programme had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of 4,686 €/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The programme could be considered cost-effective, although the 
overall difference in health benefits and costs was very modest. Longer term 
follow-up is needed.

BACKGROUND: Understanding potential trajectories in health and drivers of health 
is crucial to guiding long-term investments and policy implementation. Past work 
on forecasting has provided an incomplete landscape of future health scenarios, 
highlighting a need for a more robust modelling platform from which policy 
options and potential health trajectories can be assessed. This study provides a 
novel approach to modelling life expectancy, all-cause mortality and cause of 
death forecasts -and alternative future scenarios-for 250 causes of death from 
2016 to 2040 in 195 countries and territories.
METHODS: We modelled 250 causes and cause groups organised by the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) hierarchical cause 
structure, using GBD 2016 estimates from 1990-2016, to generate predictions for 
2017-40. Our modelling framework used data from the GBD 2016 study to 
systematically account for the relationships between risk factors and health 
outcomes for 79 independent drivers of health. We developed a three-component 
model of cause-specific mortality: a component due to changes in risk factors 
and select interventions; the underlying mortality rate for each cause that is a 
function of income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility rate 
under 25 years and time; and an autoregressive integrated moving average model 
for unexplained changes correlated with time. We assessed the performance by 
fitting models with data from 1990-2006 and using these to forecast for 2007-16. 
Our final model used for generating forecasts and alternative scenarios was 
fitted to data from 1990-2016. We used this model for 195 countries and 
territories to generate a reference scenario or forecast through 2040 for each 
measure by location. Additionally, we generated better health and worse health 
scenarios based on the 85th and 15th percentiles, respectively, of annualised 
rates of change across location-years for all the GBD risk factors, income per 
person, educational attainment, select intervention coverage, and total 
fertility rate under 25 years in the past. We used the model to generate 
all-cause age-sex specific mortality, life expectancy, and years of life lost 
(YLLs) for 250 causes. Scenarios for fertility were also generated and used in a 
cohort component model to generate population scenarios. For each reference 
forecast, better health, and worse health scenarios, we generated estimates of 
mortality and YLLs attributable to each risk factor in the future.
FINDINGS: Globally, most independent drivers of health were forecast to improve 
by 2040, but 36 were forecast to worsen. As shown by the better health 
scenarios, greater progress might be possible, yet for some drivers such as high 
body-mass index (BMI), their toll will rise in the absence of intervention. We 
forecasted global life expectancy to increase by 4·4 years (95% UI 2·2 to 6·4) 
for men and 4·4 years (2·1 to 6·4) for women by 2040, but based on better and 
worse health scenarios, trajectories could range from a gain of 7·8 years (5·9 
to 9·8) to a non-significant loss of 0·4 years (-2·8 to 2·2) for men, and an 
increase of 7·2 years (5·3 to 9·1) to essentially no change (0·1 years [-2·7 to 
2·5]) for women. In 2040, Japan, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland had a 
forecasted life expectancy exceeding 85 years for both sexes, and 59 countries 
including China were projected to surpass a life expectancy of 80 years by 2040. 
At the same time, Central African Republic, Lesotho, Somalia, and Zimbabwe had 
projected life expectancies below 65 years in 2040, indicating global 
disparities in survival are likely to persist if current trends hold. Forecasted 
YLLs showed a rising toll from several non-communicable diseases (NCDs), partly 
driven by population growth and ageing. Differences between the reference 
forecast and alternative scenarios were most striking for HIV/AIDS, for which a 
potential increase of 120·2% (95% UI 67·2-190·3) in YLLs (nearly 118 million) 
was projected globally from 2016-40 under the worse health scenario. Compared 
with 2016, NCDs were forecast to account for a greater proportion of YLLs in all 
GBD regions by 2040 (67·3% of YLLs [95% UI 61·9-72·3] globally); nonetheless, in 
many lower-income countries, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
(CMNN) diseases still accounted for a large share of YLLs in 2040 (eg, 53·5% of 
YLLs [95% UI 48·3-58·5] in Sub-Saharan Africa). There were large gaps for many 
health risks between the reference forecast and better health scenario for 
attributable YLLs. In most countries, metabolic risks amenable to health care 
(eg, high blood pressure and high plasma fasting glucose) and risks best 
targeted by population-level or intersectoral interventions (eg, tobacco, high 
BMI, and ambient particulate matter pollution) had some of the largest 
differences between reference and better health scenarios. The main exception 
was sub-Saharan Africa, where many risks associated with poverty and lower 
levels of development (eg, unsafe water and sanitation, household air pollution, 
and child malnutrition) were projected to still account for substantive 
disparities between reference and better health scenarios in 2040.
INTERPRETATION: With the present study, we provide a robust, flexible 
forecasting platform from which reference forecasts and alternative health 
scenarios can be explored in relation to a wide range of independent drivers of 
health. Our reference forecast points to overall improvements through 2040 in 
most countries, yet the range found across better and worse health scenarios 
renders a precarious vision of the future-a world with accelerating progress 
from technical innovation but with the potential for worsening health outcomes 
in the absence of deliberate policy action. For some causes of YLLs, large 
differences between the reference forecast and alternative scenarios reflect the 
opportunity to accelerate gains if countries move their trajectories toward 
better health scenarios-or alarming challenges if countries fall behind their 
reference forecasts. Generally, decision makers should plan for the likely 
continued shift toward NCDs and target resources toward the modifiable risks 
that drive substantial premature mortality. If such modifiable risks are 
prioritised today, there is opportunity to reduce avoidable mortality in the 
future. However, CMNN causes and related risks will remain the predominant 
health priority among lower-income countries. Based on our 2040 worse health 
scenario, there is a real risk of HIV mortality rebounding if countries lose 
momentum against the HIV epidemic, jeopardising decades of progress against the 
disease. Continued technical innovation and increased health spending, including 
development assistance for health targeted to the world's poorest people, are 
likely to remain vital components to charting a future where all populations can 
live full, healthy lives.

MHC molecules are found in all jawed vertebrates and are known to present 
peptides to T lymphocytes. In mammals, peptides can hang out either end of the 
peptide-binding groove of classical class II molecules, whereas the N and C 
termini of peptides are typically tightly bound to specific pockets in classical 
class I molecules. The chicken MHC, like many nonmammalian vertebrates, has a 
single dominantly expressed classical class I molecule encoded by the BF2 locus. 
We determined the structures of BF2*1201 bound to two peptides and found that 
the C terminus of one peptide hangs outside of the groove with a conformation 
much like the peptides bound to class II molecules. We found that BF2*1201 binds 
many peptides that hang out of the groove at the C terminus, and the sequences 
and structures of this MHC class I allele were determined to investigate the 
basis for this phenomenon. The classical class I molecules of mammals have a 
nearly invariant Tyr (Tyr84 in humans) that coordinates the peptide C terminus, 
but all classical class I molecules outside of mammals have an Arg in that 
position in common with mammalian class II molecules. We find that this 
invariant Arg residue switches conformation to allow peptides to hang out of the 
groove of BF2*1201, suggesting that this phenomenon is common in chickens and 
other nonmammalian vertebrates, perhaps allowing the single dominantly expressed 
class I molecule to bind a larger repertoire of peptides.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common, lethal autosomal recessive 
diseases in Caucasians with a life expectancy of 37-47 years. The CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a plasma membrane ion channel, 
confined to apical membrane of epithelia, and ensures transepithelial water and 
solute movement across secretory epithelia in several organs. Numerous CF 
mutations, including the most prevalent deletion of F508 (ΔF508) in the 
nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) leads to CFTR global misfolding and premature 
intracellular degradation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To better 
understand the misfolding mechanism caused by CF-causing point mutations in the 
NBD1, which is poorly understood, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and 
hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) are the 
choice of techniques. These established methods can measure the conformational 
dynamics of the NBD1 globally and at peptide resolution level by monitoring 
backbone amide HDX, respectively, and will be instrumental to evaluate the 
mechanism of action of CF mutations and folding correctors that rescue CFTR 
folding defects via stabilizing the mutant NBD1.

INTRODUCTION: Distal radius fractures (DRF) are the most common fractures of the 
upper extremities. The incidence is expected to continue rising in the next 
years due to the increased life expectancy. Palmar locking plate stabilizing has 
since become the standard treatment for dorsally displaced DRF with a 
complication rate of 8-39% reported in the literature. Main aim of this study 
was to investigate the incidence of complications after DRF stabilization using 
palmar angular stable locking plate.
METHODS: A retrospective medical records review conducted from January 2013 to 
December 2016 included a total of 392 patients with DRF, that were stabilized 
using palmar angular stable locking plate and showed a minimum follow-up of 
3 months. The group comprised 259 female and 133 male patients with a mean 
follow-up interval of 11 months (range 3-52 months). All recorded complications 
were documented. Range of motion (ROM) in extension, flexion, supination, 
pronation, radial- and ulnar deviation of the last follow-up was noted. Age was 
divided into younger than 65 years (< 65 years) and older than 65 years 
(≥ 65 years). The primary, immediate postoperative and final checkup radiographs 
were scrutinized for alignment and intra-articular step-off.
RESULTS: A total of 51 (13%) early and 17 late (4%) complications were recorded 
in 392 patients. The most common complications included carpal tunnel syndrome 
(3%), complex regional pain syndrome (3%) and loss of reduction (2%). Of the 68 
complications, only 25 (6%) were directly related to the plate. 73% of all 
complications occurred in AO type C fractures. Patients without complications 
showed a significantly better ROM in extension, flexion, pronation and 
supination than patients with complications. No significant differences in 
incidence of complications, ROM or loss of reduction could be found between 
patients over and under 65 years of age. Gender and type of immobilization 
showed no significant influence on the complication rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization of DRF by palmar angular stable locking plate is a 
safe form of treatment. In the majority of the cases a good clinical and 
radiological outcome with no complications was documented. Gender and type of 
immobilization had no impact on the complication rate and an age over 65 years 
is not associated with an increased risk for complications or restricted ROM.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Childhood-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is believed 
to be a more severe disease than adult-onset IBD, but there is little 
information on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in patients with 
childhood-onset IBD. We performed a population-based cohort study, with 50 years 
of follow-up, to estimate absolute and relative risks for overall and 
cause-specific mortality in patients with childhood-onset IBD, during childhood 
and adulthood.
METHODS: We identified children with a diagnosis of IBD (younger than 18 years) 
in the Swedish nationwide health registers (1964-2014; n = 9442) and individuals 
from the general population matched for sex, age, calendar year, and place of 
residence (reference group; n = 93,180). Hazard ratios (HR) for death were 
estimated using Cox regression separately in patients with ulcerative colitis 
(n = 4671), Crohn's disease (n = 3780), and IBD unclassified (n = 991). HRs were 
compared among calendar periods.
RESULTS: During 138,690 person-years of follow-up, 294 deaths (2.1/1000 
person-years) occurred among the patients with IBD compared with 940 deaths in 
the reference group (0.7/1000 person-years; adjusted HR, 3.2; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 2.8-3.7). Mean age at end of follow-up was 30 years. HRs were 
increased for patients with ulcerative colitis 4.0, 95% CI 3.4-4.7; Crohn's 
disease 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-3.0; and IBD unclassified 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.4. Among 
patients younger than 18 years, there were 27 deaths from IBD 4.9, 95% CI 
3.0-7.7. Among young adults with IBD, we found no evidence that HRs for death 
decreased from 1964 through 2014 (P = .90).
CONCLUSIONS: Children with IBD have a 3-fold increase in risk of death when 
followed through adulthood. The relative risk for death has not decreased with 
development of new drugs for treatment of IBD.

PURPOSE: A hydrogel rectal spacer (HRS) is a medical device that is approved by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to increase the separation between the 
prostate and rectum. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of HRS use for 
reduction in radiation therapy (RT) toxicities in patients with prostate cancer 
(PC) undergoing external beam RT (EBRT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multistate Markov model was constructed from the U.S. 
payer perspective to examine the cost-effectiveness of HRS in men with localized 
PC receiving EBRT (EBRT alone vs EBRT + HRS). The subgroups analyzed included 
site of HRS placement (hospital outpatient, physician office, ambulatory surgery 
center) and proportion of patients with good baseline erectile function (EF). 
Data on EF, gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities incidence, and 
potential risks associated with HRS implantation were obtained from a recently 
published randomized clinical trial. Health utilities and costs were derived 
from the literature and the 2018 Physician Fee Schedule and were discounted 3% 
annually. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were modeled for a 
5-year period from receipt of RT. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 
value-based threshold analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The per-patient 5-year incremental cost for spacers administered in a 
hospital outpatient setting was $3578, and the incremental effectiveness was 
0.0371 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $96,440/QALY for 
patients with PC undergoing HRS insertion in a hospital and $39,286/QALY for 
patients undergoing HRS insertion in an ambulatory facility. For men with good 
baseline EF, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $35,548/QALY and 
$9627/QALY in hospital outpatient and ambulatory facility settings, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, HRS is 
cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000. These results 
contain substantial uncertainty, suggesting more evidence is needed to refine 
future decision-making.

OBJECTIVE: Hong Kong is a high-income city of China with an intermediate 
tuberculosis (TB) burden, and 1% of TB cases are multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB). 
The aim of this study was to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of adding 
bedaquiline or delamanid to the background regimen (BR) for the treatment of 
MDR-TB in Hong Kong.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes over a 
10-year time horizon for MDR-TB patients treated with bedaquiline plus BR 
(B-BR), delamanid plus BR (D-BR), or BR alone. Outcome measures included direct 
medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, BR was the least costly regimen (USD 47396) 
with the lowest QALYs gained (6.347). Compared to BR, B-BR gained an additional 
0.731 QALYs with incremental cost of USD 9. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of B-BR was USD 12/QALY. D-BR was more costly than BR by USD 20 164 
and gained an additional 0.012 QALYs. The ICER of D-BR was USD 1 680333/QALY. In 
the probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10000 Monte Carlo simulations, B-BR 
and D-BR were cost-effective 99.98% and 5.13% of the time, respectively, using 
1× gross domestic product per capita (USD 46 182) as the willingness-to-pay
