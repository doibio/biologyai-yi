breast cancer and advanced gastric cancer to $8.66 per mg and $0.20 per mg, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Like expected value IBP, outcomes guarantee contracts can also vary 
payment based on indication. In addition, an outcomes guarantee can also reduce 
uncertainty regarding effectiveness and better align payment with the actual 
value of a treatment.

Fruit flies in the genus Bactrocera are global, economically important pests of 
agricultural food crops. However, basic life history information about these 
pests, which is vital for designing more effective control methods, is currently 
lacking. Artificial diets can be used as a suitable replacement for natural host 
plants for rearing fruit flies under laboratory conditions, and this study 
reports on the two-sex life-table parameters of four Bactrocera species 
(Bactrocera correcta, Bactrocera dorsalis, Bactrocera cucurbitae, and Bactrocera 
tau) reared on a semi-artificial diet comprising corn flour, banana, sodium 
benzoate, yeast, sucrose, winding paper, hydrochloric acid and water. The 
results indicated that the larval development period of B. correcta (6.81 ± 0.65 
days) was significantly longer than those of the other species. The fecundity of 
B. dorsalis (593.60 eggs female-1) was highest among the four species. There 
were no differences in intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of 
increase (λ) among the four species. The gross reproductive rate (GRR) and net 
reproductive rate (R0) of B. dorsalis were higher than those of the other 
species, and the mean generation time (T) of B. cucurbitae (42.08 ± 1.21 h) was 
longer than that of the other species. We conclude that the semi-artificial diet 
was most suitable for rearing B. dorsalis, due to its shorter development time 
and higher fecundity. These results will be useful for future studies of fruit 
fly management.

AIM: There are some recognized treatment modalities in the literature for the 
treatment of lumbar degenerative diseases,which cause pain and avoidance of 
daily life activities for the patients.The most widely accepted algorithm in the 
literature is medical treatment,physical therapy and minimally invasive 
pain-relieving therapies,if necessary,followed by surgical interventions.The 
common procedure used in neurosurgery practice is the decompression of neural 
elements followed by fusion.It is reported in the literature that unilateral 
pedicle fixation and Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion(TLIF) procedure have 
many advantages compared to bilateral pedicle screw implementation(PSF).We 
examined the clinical and radiological follow-up and results of our patients 
undergoing fusion procedure by unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw 
fixation along with TLIF.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 54 patients were included in the study.33 patients were 
operated with bilateral PSF and TLIF and 21 had unilateral PSF and TLIF.The 
patients were evaluated preoperatively,on the postoperative 15th day,6th and 
12th month, and at the time of last examination (38 months in average for all 
patients) using Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) and Oswestry Disability 
Index(ODI).Fusion rates were examined with direct X-ray films with 
flexion-extension dynamic views and 3D CT scan.
RESULTS: Operation times are shorter and blood loss is less in the unilateral 
PSF group.Fusion rates are similar in both groups with no statistical 
significance.For both groups significant clinical improvement was observed in 
the preoperative and postoperative scores.
CONCLUSION: Unilateral PSF along with TLIF procedure is an effective option in 
selected patients.We need prospective randomized studies with higher number of 
patients and longer follow-up periods for more reliable results.

OBJECTIVE: The study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab, a fully 
human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin (IL)-17A, vs 
currently licensed biologic treatments in patients with active psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) from a Canadian healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A decision analytic semi-Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness 
of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg compared to subcutaneous biologics adalimumab, 
certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and ustekinumab, and intravenous 
biologics infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in biologic-naive and 
biologic-experienced patients over a lifetime horizon. The response to 
treatments was evaluated after 12 weeks by PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) 
response rates. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of 
biologic treatment were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model 
input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI], Health Assessment 
Questionnaire [HAQ], withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected 
from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits 
were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An annual discount rate 
of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings 
were evaluated via sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Biologic-naive patients treated with secukinumab achieved the highest 
number of QALYs (8.54) at the lowest cost (CAD 925,387) over a lifetime horizon 
vs all comparators. Secukinumab dominated all treatments, except for infliximab 
and its biosimilar, which achieved minimally more QALYs (8.58). However, 
infliximab and its biosimilar incurred more costs than secukinumab (infliximab: 
CAD 1,015,437; infliximab biosimilar: CAD 941,004), resulting in higher 
cost-effectiveness estimates relative to secukinumab. In the 
biologic-experienced population, secukinumab dominated all treatments as it 
generated more QALYs (8.89) at lower costs (CAD 954,692). Deterministic 
sensitivity analyses indicated the results were most sensitive to variation in 
PsARC response rates, change in HAQ, and utility values in both populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Secukinumab is either dominant or cost-effective vs all licensed 
biologics for the treatment of active PsA in biologic-naive and 
biologic-experienced populations in Canada.

With increase life expectancy, surgical indications in elderly become more 
frequent. The aim of this study was to analyze indications and outcome of 
laparoscopic adrenalectomy in patients over 75. Between 1994 and 2014, 641 
patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Preoperatively, all patients had 
a standardized preoperative work-up. Patients over 75 were compared with a 
control group of younger patients. The median age was 52 years (41 to 61) and 
3.6% of patients (n=23) were over 75. Patients over 75 were more frequently 
operated for malignant lesion (21.7% vs. 4.7%; P=0.005). There was no 
postoperative mortality. Conversion rate was 3.4% (n=22), with no significant 
difference between the groups. The overall morbidity and severe morbidity rates 
were, respectively, 16.9% and 3.3%, with no significant difference between the 
groups. In experienced team and for selected patients, laparoscopic 
adrenalectomy after 75 years is safe, without increased postoperative morbidity, 
as compared with younger population.

BACKGROUND: The lifetime economic burden of thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) is 
known to be high, but evidence of variability of costs in relation to the 
American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate lifetime economic costs of hospitalization by AIS grade 
in thoracic SCI.
METHODS: Using SCI Model Systems data from January 2000 to March 2016 from the 
National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, we estimated mean total annual 
days of all-cause hospitalization by AIS grade among persons with thoracic SCI, 
based on assessments 1, 5, and 10 yr post-injury. We combined this information 
with secondary cost data and projections of life expectancy to estimate lifetime 
economic costs of hospitalization by AIS grade in persons aged 35 yr at time of 
thoracic SCI. Future costs were discounted to present value at 3% annually.
RESULTS: One year post-injury, mean total annual days of hospitalization ranged 
from 2.1 for persons with AIS-D injuries to 5.9 for those who were AIS-A. 
Similar differences were noted 5 and 10 yr post-SCI. The estimated net present 
value of expected lifetime costs of hospitalization following thoracic SCI at 
age 35 yr was $321 534, $249 514, $188 989, and $68 120 (2015 US$) for AIS-A, 
AIS-B, AIS-C, and AIS-D injuries, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Persons with less severe thoracic SCI, as reflected in AIS grade, 
spend fewer days in hospital over their lifetimes, leading to lower costs of 
inpatient care. Therapies improving AIS grade following thoracic SCI may provide 
cost savings in addition to addressing substantial unmet need.

Background: The aim of this study was to describe the natural long-term course 
of end-stage liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection 
by measuring survival and complication rates in the era prior to the arrival of 
new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs. Methods: A retrospective 
population-based cohort study was designed to establish the follow-up of 
patients hospitalized for a decompensated cirrhotic event or hepatocellular 
carcinoma using electronic records from hospital discharge databases from 2009 
to 2015. Their survival was compared with a sex, age and non-liver mortality 
excess matched simulation of the general Spanish population. Results: A total of 
253 patients were included in the study. Among those with decompensated 
cirrhosis (n = 151) the hospital admission rate was 1.88 per patient-year with a 
mortality rate of 0.16 per patient-year. Mean survival was 4.10 years for 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and 1.75 for non-transplanted 
hepatocellular carcinoma, compared to 18.39 years for the general population. 
Conclusion: Our results show the complexity and rapid progression of end-stage 
liver disease associated with HCV infection. The considerable loss of life 
expectancy associated with the development of decompensated cirrhosis in 
patients with chronic HCV infection in the absence of viral clearance through 
treatment is acutely evident.

BACKGROUND: Aortic coarctation (AC) is most commonly identified in pediatric 
patients; however, adults can present with late sequelae of untreated 
coarctation or complications of prior open repair. To date, there are limited 
data about the role of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in this group 
of patients. The purpose of this analysis was to describe our experience with 
management of adult coarctation patients using TEVAR.
METHODS: All TEVAR patients treated for primary coarctation or late sequelae of 
previous open repair (eg, pseudoaneurysm, recurrent coarctation or anastomotic 
stenosis related to index open coarctation repair) were reviewed. Demographics, 
comorbidities, procedure-related variables, postoperative outcomes, and 
reintervention were recorded. Computed tomography centerline assessments of 
endograft morphology were completed to delineate stent anatomy at the 
coarctation site. Survival and reintervention were estimated using life-table 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were identified (median age, 46 years [range, 
33-71 years]; 67% male [n = 14]). Nine patients (43%) were treated for 
symptomatic primary (n = 6) or recurrent (n = 3) coarctation. Other indications 
included degenerative thoracic aneurysm (n = 6), pseudoaneurysm (n = 4), and 
dissection (n = 2). Technical success was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
84%-100%). No 30-day mortality or paraplegia events occurred; however, two 
patients (10%) experienced postoperative nondisabling stroke. In primary or 
recurrent coarctation patients with available computed tomography imaging (n = 8 
of 9), nominal stent graft diameters were achieved proximal and distal to the 
coarctation (range, -0.4 to -1.2 mm of desired final stent diameter). Specific 
to the coarctation site, there was a significant increase in aortic diameter 
after TEVAR (before stenting, 11.5 [95% CI, 6.8-12.3] mm; after stenting, 15 
[95% CI, 13.7-15.7] mm; P = .004). Concurrently, systolic arterial blood 
pressure at time of discharge was significantly lower (before stenting: 147 mm 
Hg; 95% CI, 137-157 mm Hg; after stenting: 124 mm Hg; 95% CI, 118-134 mm Hg; P = 
.02). For all patients, median clinical follow-up time was 8 months 
(interquartile range, 3-13 months; range, 1-106 months). Three endoleaks were 
detected, all of which were type II related to left (n = 2) or aberrant (n = 1) 
subclavian arteries. Four patients (19%) underwent reintervention (median time, 
7 months; range, 2-12 months), with three of four being subclavian artery 
embolization; one was an aortic root replacement for ascending aneurysm with 
bicuspid aortic valve. One-year freedom from reintervention was 78% ± 9% (95% 
CI, 42%-92%). The 1- and 3-year survival was 95% ± 5% (95% CI, 71%-99%). One 
late death was related to complications from pre-existing congenital heart 
disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Adult AC patients can be treated safely with TEVAR, and the annular 
constriction of an AC can be successfully dilated by the stent graft. Given 
these findings, a greater number of patients with longer term follow-up is 
warranted to further define the role of TEVAR in the management of adult AC 
patients.

University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

BACKGROUND: As advances in medicine have increased life expectancy, more 
octogenarians are undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) than ever before. 
Concerns exist, however, about the safety of performing this elective procedure 
in this age group. The purpose of this study is to determine the 30-day 
complications associated with THA patients over 80 years of age and to identify 
high-risk patients.
METHODS: We queried the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program database for all patients who underwent primary THA from 
2011 to 2014. Demographic variables, medical comorbidities, and 30-day 
complication, readmission, and reoperation rates were compared between patients 
under vs over 80 years of age. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
then performed to identify independent risk factors of poor short-term outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the total 66,839 patients who underwent THA, 7198 (11%) patients 
were 80 years of age or older. Octogenarians had a higher overall complication 
rate (29% vs 15%, P < .001) and a higher mortality rate (0.9% vs 0.1%, P < 
.001). When controlling for other comorbidities, age over 80 years is an 
independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio 2.02, 95% confidence interval 
1.25-3.26, P = .004) and complications (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 
1.30-1.525, P < .001) following THA. Malnutrition and chronic kidney disease are 
also independent risk factors for readmission, complications, and mortality (all 
P < .05).
CONCLUSION: THA in patients older than 80 years old are at an increased risk of 
complications and mortality. Octogenarian patients should be counseled on their 
risk profile, particularly those with malnutrition and chronic kidney disease.

Access to antiretrovirals has increased the life expectancy of patients living 
with HIV. However, HIV-viral hepatitis coinfections in countries endemic for 
these infections make management more difficult. To determine the extent of 
these coinfections in Gabon, we investigated markers of hepatitis B, C, and E 
viruses in 762 adults infected with HIV-1 by ELISA. We used real-time PCR to 
quantify plasma HBV DNA (HBV VL) and amplified HCV and HEV RNA by nested RT-PCR 
and PCR.The seroprevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection was 9.3 %. Among 
patients with isolated HBcAc profiles, the prevalence of occult hepatitis B 
infection was 26.7 %, for a real prevalence (detectable CV-HBV) of 17.3 % of the 
total population. HCV seroprevalence was 8.8 %. Of the 67 HIV-positive patients, 
76.1 % had replicative profiles (detectable HCV RNA), that is, 6.7 % of the 
total population. For hepatitis E, seroprevalence was 3.5 %. No case of chronic 
HEV infection was found. In conclusion, this study highlights a high rate of 
HIV-Hepatitis B, C and E coinfections in Gabon. In addition, we show the 
interest of looking for chronic infections (replicative profiles) in 
HIV-infected patients in Gabon. The establishment of technical platforms for 
this type of research, accessible to middle-income countries, is necessary.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term effect on health and well-being of the 
Lifestyle Matters programme.
DESIGN: Qualitative study of a subset of intervention arm participants who 
participated in the Lifestyle Matters randomised controlled trial (RCT).
SETTING: The intervention took place at community venues within two sites in the 
UK.
PARTICIPANTS: A purposeful sample of 13 participants aged between 66 and 88 
years from the intervention arm of the RCT were interviewed at 24 months post 
randomisation. Interviews aimed to understand how participants had used their 
time in the preceding 2 years and whether the intervention had any impact on 
their lifestyle choices, participation in meaningful activities and well-being.
INTERVENTION: Lifestyle Matters is a 4-month occupational therapy intervention, 
consisting of group and individual sessions, designed to enable community living 
older people to make positive lifestyle choices and participate in new or 
neglected activities through increasing self-efficacy.
RESULTS: Interviews revealed that the majority of interviewed participants were 
reportedly active at 24 months, with daily routines and lifestyles not changing 
significantly over time. All participants raised some form of benefit from 
attending Lifestyle Matters, including an improved perspective on life, trying 
new hobbies and meeting new friends. A number of intervention participants spoke 
of adapting to their changing circumstances, but there were significant and 
lasting benefits for 2 of 13 intervention participants interviewed.
CONCLUSION: The majority of those who experienced the Lifestyle Matters 
intervention reported minor benefits and increases in self-efficacy, but they 
did not perceive that it significantly improved their health and well-being. The 
two participants who had experienced major benefits also reported having had 
life-changing events, suggesting that this intervention is most effective at the 
time when lifestyle has to be reconsidered if mental well-being is to be 
sustained.

Hematologic malignancies are rare cancers that develop refractory disease upon 
patient relapse, resulting in decreased life expectancy and quality of life. DNA 
repair inhibitors are a promising strategy to treat cancer but are limited by 
their hematologic toxicity in combination with conventional chemotherapies. 
Dbait are large molecules targeting the signaling of DNA damage and inhibiting 
all the double-strand DNA break pathways. Dbait have been shown to sensitize 
resistant solid tumors to radiotherapy and platinum salts. Here, we analyze the 
efficacy and lack of toxicity of AsiDNA, a cholesterol form of Dbait, in 
hematologic malignancies. We show that AsiDNA enters cells via LDL receptors and 
activates its molecular target, the DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) in 
10 lymphoma and leukemia cell lines (Jurkat-E6.1, MT-4, MOLT-4, 174xCEM.T2, 
Sup-T1, HuT-78, Raji, IM-9, THP-1, and U-937) and in normal primary human PBMCs, 
resting or activated T cells, and CD34+ progenitors. The treatment with AsiDNA 
induced necrotic and mitotic cell death in most cancer cell lines and had no 
effect on blood or bone marrow cells, including immune activation, 
proliferation, or differentiation. Sensitivity to AsiDNA was independent of p53 
status. Survival to combined treatment with conventional therapies (etoposide, 
cyclophosphamides, vincristine, or radiotherapy) was analyzed by isobolograms 
and combination index. AsiDNA synergized with all treatments, except 
vincristine, without increasing their toxicity to normal blood cells. AsiDNA is 
a novel, potent, and wide-range drug with the potential to specifically increase 
DNA-damaging treatment toxicity in tumor without adding toxicity in normal 
hematologic cells or inducing immune dysregulation. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(12);

Research on mortality modeling of multiple populations focuses mainly on 
extrapolating past mortality trends and summarizing these trends by one or more 
common latent factors. This article proposes a multipopulation stochastic 
mortality model that uses the explanatory power of economic growth. In 
particular, we extend the Li and Lee model (Li and Lee 2005) by including 
economic growth, represented by the real gross domestic product (GDP) per 
capita, to capture the common mortality trend for a group of populations with 
similar socioeconomic conditions. We find that our proposed model provides a 
better in-sample fit and an out-of-sample forecast performance. Moreover, it 
generates lower (higher) forecasted period life expectancy for countries with 
high (low) GDP per capita than the Li and Lee model.

A scalable, viable process was developed for the Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 
(FGF21) protein-antibody conjugate, CVX-343, an extended half-life therapeutic 
for the treatment of metabolic disease. CVX-343 utilizes the CovX antibody 
scaffold technology platform that was specifically developed for peptide and 
protein half-life extension. CVX-343 is representative of a growing number of 
complex novel peptide- and protein-based bioconjugate molecules currently being 
explored as therapeutic candidates. The complexity of these bioconjugates, 
assembled using well-established chemistries, can lead to very difficult 
production schemes requiring multiple starting materials and a combination of 
diverse technologies. Key improvements had to be made to the original CVX-343 
Phase 1 manufacturing process in preparation for Phase 3 and commercial 
manufacturing. A strategy of minimizing FGF21A129C dimerization and stabilizing 
the FGF21A129C Drug Substance Intermediate (DSI), linker, and activated FGF21 
intermediate was pursued. The use of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to 
prevent FGF21A129C dimerization through disulfide formation was eliminated. 
FGF21A129C dimerization and linker hydrolysis were minimized by formulating and 
activating FGF21A129C at acidic instead of neutral pH. An activation use test 
was utilized to guide FGF21A129C pooling in order to minimize misfolds, dimers, 
and misfolded dimers in the FGF21A129C DSI. After final optimization of reaction 
conditions, a process was established that reduced the consumption of FGF21A129C 
by 36% (from 4.7 to 3.0 equivalents) and the consumption of linker by 55% (from 
1.4 to 0.95 equivalents for a smaller required amount of FGF21A129C ). The 
overall process time was reduced from ∼5 to ∼3 days. The product distribution 
improved from containing ∼60% to ∼75% desired bifunctionalized (+2 FGF21) 
FGF21-antibody conjugate in the crude conjugation mixture and from ∼80% to ∼85% 
in the final CVX-343 Drug Substance (DS), while maintaining the same overall 
process yield based on antibody scaffold input.

literature.

Given the demographic trends toward a considerably longer life expectancy, the 
percentage of elderly patients with prostate cancer will increase further in the 
upcoming decades. Therefore, the question arises, should patients ≥75 years old 
be offered radical prostatectomy and under which circumstances? For treatment 
decision-making, life expectancy is more important than biological age. As a 
result, a patient's health and mental status has to be determined and radical 
treatment should only be offered to those who are fit. As perioperative 
morbidity and mortality in these patients is increased relative to younger 
patients, patient selection according to comorbidities is a key issue that needs 
to be addressed. It is known from the literature that elderly men show notably 
worse tumor characteristics, leading to worse oncologic outcomes after 
treatment. Moreover, elderly patients also demonstrate worse postoperative 
recovery of continence and erectile function. As the absolute rates of both 
oncological and functional outcomes are still very reasonable in patients ≥75 
years, a radical prostatectomy can be offered to highly selected and healthy 
elderly patients. Nevertheless, patients clearly need to be informed about the 
worse outcomes and higher perioperative risks compared to younger patients.

The condition of the adult with intellectual disability (AWID) includes the 
largely autonomous, integrated person but also the one in need of constant 
support, with grossly altered communication abilities, frequently affected by 
somatic and mental comorbidities and non-adapted behaviors. Their prevalence is 
about 1 % of the adult population. They should benefit from particular attention 
of health care professionals, including in mental health. However, their access 
to health care is often limited and their quality of life and life expectancy 
are diminished. Recent advances in the field of ID include modified diagnostic 
criteria, as well as individualized care in a multidisciplinary approach in 
partnership with relatives and professionals from the community/service 
providers. These approaches allow to better address special needs of AWID.

Publisher: La condition de l’adulte porteur d’un diagnostic de handicap 
intellectuel (ADHI) va de la personne largement autonome et intégrée dans la 
communauté à celle nécessitant une surveillance constante, avec des difficultés 
de communication, des comorbidités somatiques et mentales et des comportements 
non adaptés. Leur prévalence est d’environ 1 % de la population adulte. Elles 
devraient bénéficier d’une attention particulière de la part des professionnels 
de la santé, y compris mentale. Cependant, l’accès aux soins et leur qualité 
sont souvent limités. L’espérance et la qualité de vie des ADHI sont diminuées. 
Des évolutions dans le domaine du handicap intellectuel concernent le diagnostic 
et les approches de soins individualisés et intégrés en partenariat avec les 
proches et le réseau. Elles permettent de mieux répondre aux spécificités de 
l’ADHI.

Chronic myeloid leukemia - a model disease for targeted therapy Chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) pioneered as the first human malignancy linked to a specific 
cytogenetic aberration (the Philadelphia chromosome), which led the way to 
specific targeted therapies with imatinib (Glivec) and later tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKI). Continuous TKI administration, blocking the oncogenic fusion 
protein Bcr-Abl, has revolutionized the outcome of CML, transforming an almost 
uniformly deadly disease into a chronic disorder with a near to normal life 
expectancy for many patients. There are now indications that, in a portion of 
patients achieving deep molecular responses, TKI treatment can be stopped 
without signs of relapse, indicating that these drugs may indeed induce cure. 
This is of particular importance since adverse events related to long-term TKI 
therapy, compromising quality of life, are now being increasingly recognized. 
With the recent introduction of generics the price of imatinib has dropped by 
more than 95% in Sweden, making an already cost effective treatment even more 
attractive.

Background/Study Context: The aging process is associated with a decline in 
muscle mass, strength, and conditioning. Two training methods that may be useful 
to improve muscle function are Pilates and proprioceptive neuromuscular 
facilitation (PNF). Thus, the present study aimed to compare the influence of 
training programs using Pilates and PNF methods with elderly women.
METHODS: Sixty healthy elderly women were randomly divided into three groups: 
Pilates group, PNF group, and control group. Pilates and PNF groups underwent 
1-month training programs with Pilates and PNF methods, respectively. The 
control group received no intervention during the 1 month. The maximal isometric 
force levels from knee extension and flexion, as well as the electromyography 
(EMG) signals from quadriceps and biceps femoris, were recorded before and after 
the 1-month intervention period.
RESULTS: A two-way analysis of variance revealed that the Pilates and PNF 
methods induced similar strength gains from knee flexors and extensors, but 
Pilates exhibited greater low-gamma drive (i.e., oscillations in 30-60 Hz) in 
the EMG power spectrum after the training period.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support use of both Pilates and PNF methods to 
enhance lower limb muscle strength in older groups, which is very important for 
gait, postural stability, and performance of daily life activities.

Gender inequality in self-reported health among the elderly in contemporary 
welfare countries: A cross-country analysis of time use activities, 
socioeconomic positions and family characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Paradoxically, despite their longer life expectancy, women report 
poorer health than men. Time devoted to differing social roles could be an 
explanation for the observed gender differences in health among the elderly. The 
objective of this study was to explain gender differences in self-reported 
health among the elderly by taking time use activities, socio-economic 
positions, family characteristics and cross-national differences into account.
METHODS: Data from the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) on 13,223 men and 
18,192 women from Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and the US were analyzed. Multiple 
binary logistic regression models were used to examine the association between 
social factors and health for men and women separately. We further identified 
the relative contribution of different factors to total gender inequality in 
health using the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method.
RESULTS: Whereas time allocated to paid work, housework and active leisure 
activities were positively associated with health, time devoted to passive 
leisure and personal activities were negatively associated with health among 
both men and women, but the magnitude of the association varied by gender and 
country. We found significant gender differences in health in Germany, Italy and 
Spain, but not in the other countries. The decomposition showed that differences 
in the time allocated to active leisure and level of educational attainment 
accounted for the largest health gap.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents a first step in understanding cross-national 
differences in the association between health status and time devoted to 
role-related activities among elderly men and women. The results, therefore, 
demonstrate the need of using an integrated framework of social factors in 
analyzing and explaining the gender and cross-national differences in the health 
of the elderly population.

BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men who have sex with 
men (MSM) are at disproportionately high risk for anal cancer. There is no 
definitive approach to the management of high-grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesions (HSIL), which are precursors of anal cancer, and evidence suggests that 
posttreatment adjuvant quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination 
improves HSIL treatment effectiveness. The objectives of this study were to 
evaluate the optimal HSIL management strategy with respect to clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and to identify the optimal age for 
initiating HSIL management.
METHODS: A decision analytic model of the natural history of anal carcinoma and 
HSIL management strategies was constructed for HIV-positive MSM who were 27 
years old or older. The model was informed by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results-Medicare database and published studies. Outcomes included the 
lifetime cost, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative 
risk of cancer and cancer-related deaths, and cost-effectiveness from a societal 
perspective.
RESULTS: Active monitoring was the most effective approach in patients 29 years 
or younger; thereafter, HSIL treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination became 
most effective. When cost-effectiveness was considered (ie, an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] < $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year), do 
nothing was cost-effective until the age of 38 years, and HSIL treatment plus 
adjuvant qHPV vaccination was cost-effective beyond the age of 38 years (95% 
confidence interval, 34-43 years). The ICER decreased as the age at HSIL 
management increased. Outcomes were sensitive to the rate of HSIL regression or 
progression and the cost of high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of HSIL in HIV-positive MSM who are 38 years old or 
older with treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination is likely to be 
cost-effective. The conservative approach of no treatment is likely to be 
cost-effective in younger patients. Cancer 2017;123:4709-4719. © 2017 American

As life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased 
dramatically, so has the need for a guided, structured transition from pediatric 
to adult-focused care. A formalized transition program allows for seamless 
transfer of patients between providers, helping to ensure continuity of care, 
and avoid potential declines associated with inconsistent medical care. New CF 
Center guidelines issued by the CFF strongly recommend that each center 
establish a transition program for age-appropriate transition to an adult CF 
clinic. In this article, we explore the remaining barriers to establishing a 
transition program in a CF Center and offer examples of several successful 
models. We describe CFF-sponsored and other initiatives that exist to support 
centers in establishing a transition program and discuss the need for ongoing 
research in this area.

BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases disproportionately burden Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander people in Australia, with cardiovascular (CV) diseases being the 
greatest contributor. To improve quality of life and life expectancy for people 
living with CV disease, secondary prevention strategies such as rehabilitation 
and self-management programs are critical. However, there is no published 
evidence examining the effect of chronic condition self-management (CCSM) group 
programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have, or are at 
risk of, CV disease specifically. This study evaluates the Work It Out program 
for its effect on clinical outcome measures in urban Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander participants with or at risk of CV disease.
METHODS: This study was underpinned by a conceptual framework based on 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community control. Participants had at 
least one diagnosed CV disease, or at least one CV disease risk factor. 
Short-term changes in clinical outcome measures over (approximately) 12 weeks
