losses were 1,718 fold with significant coefficient (β) in the migrant group. 
DALYs lost were significantly associated with socioenvironmental factors such as 
mother's illiteracy (β = .18; p < .001), no hand wash before eating (β = .08; p 
= .004), and no hand wash after defecation (β = .10; p < .001). This puts 
emphasis clearly on the awareness at household level, especially of mothers and 
children under age 5 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in formulating migration-related 
policies.

OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of diabetes in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) 
is among the highest in the world. We used findings from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2013 study to calculate the burden of diabetes in the EMR.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The burden of diabetes and burden attributable to 
high fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) were calculated for each of the 22 countries 
in the EMR between 1990 and 2013. A systematic analysis was performed on 
mortality and morbidity data to estimate prevalence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: The diabetes death rate increased by 60.7%, from 12.1 per 100,000 
population (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 11.2-13.2) in 1990 to 19.5 per 
100,000 population (95% UI: 17.4-21.5) in 2013. The diabetes DALY rate increased 
from 589.9 per 100,000 (95% UI: 498.0-698.0) in 1990 to 883.5 per 100,000 
population (95% UI: 732.2-1,051.5) in 2013. In 2013, HFPG accounted for 4.9% 
(95% UI: 4.4-5.3) of DALYs from all causes. Total DALYs from diabetes increased 
by 148.6% during 1990-2013; population growth accounted for a 62.9% increase, 
and aging and increase in age-specific DALY rates accounted for 31.8% and 53.9%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that diabetes causes a major burden in the EMR, 
which is increasing. Aging and population growth do not fully explain this 
increase in the diabetes burden. Programs and policies are urgently needed to 
reduce risk factors for diabetes, increase awareness of the disease, and improve 
diagnosis and control of diabetes to reduce its burden.

Resting heart rate is a heritable trait correlated with life span. Little is 
known about the genetic contribution to resting heart rate and its relationship 
with mortality. We performed a genome-wide association discovery and replication 
analysis starting with 19.9 million genetic variants and studying up to 265,046 
individuals to identify 64 loci associated with resting heart rate (P < 5 × 
10-8); 46 of these were novel. We then used the genetic variants identified to 
study the association between resting heart rate and all-cause mortality. We 
observed that a genetically predicted resting heart rate increase of 5 beats per 
minute was associated with a 20% increase in mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.20, 
95% confidence interval 1.11-1.28, P = 8.20 × 10-7) translating to a reduction 
in life expectancy of 2.9 years for males and 2.6 years for females. Our 
findings provide evidence for shared genetic predictors of resting heart rate 
and all-cause mortality.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the quality and quantity of cost-utility 
analyses (CUAs) in Brazil.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide a systematic review of 
published CUAs of healthcare technologies in Brazil.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of economic evaluations studies 
published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health 
Sciences Literature), SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), NHS EED 
(National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database), HTA (Health Technology 
Assessment) Database, Web of Science, Scopus, Bireme (Biblioteca Regional de 
Medicina), BVS ECOS (Health Economics database of the Brazilian Virtual Library 
of Health), and SISREBRATS (Sistema de Informação da Rede Brasileira de 
Avaliação de Tecnologias em Saúde [Brazilian Network for the Evaluation of 
Health Technologies]) from 1980 to 2013. Articles were included if they were 
CUAs according to the classification devised by Drummond et al. Two independent 
reviewers screened articles for relevance and carried out data extraction. 
Disagreements were resolved through discussion or through consultation with a 
third reviewer. We performed a qualitative narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: Of the 535 health economic evaluations (HEEs) relating to Brazil, only 
40 were CUAs and therefore included in the analysis. Most studies adhered to 
methodological guidelines for quality of reporting and 77.5% used 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as the health outcome. Of these studies, 
51.6% did not report the population used to elicit preferences for outcomes and 
45.2% used a specific population such as expert opinion. The preference 
elicitation method was not reported in 58.1% of these studies. The majority 
(80.6%) of studies did not report the instrument used to derive health state 
valuations and no publication reported whether tariffs (or preference weights) 
were national or international. No study mentioned the methodology used to 
estimate QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Many published Brazilian cost-utility studies adhere to key 
recommended general methods for HEE; however, the use of QALY calculations is 
far from being the current international standard. Development of health 
preferences research can contribute to quality improvement of health technology 
assessment reports in Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Several treatments are on the horizon for Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD), a terminal orphan disease. In many jurisdictions, decisions 
regarding pricing and reimbursement of these health technologies comprise 
evidence of value for money.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a cost-effectiveness model 
based on the Duchenne muscular dystrophy Functional Ability Self-Assessment Tool 
(DMDSAT), a new rating scale created specifically to measure disease progression 
in clinical practice and trials and model DMD in economic evaluations, and 
compare it with two alternative model structures.
METHODS: We constructed three Markov cohort state-transition models to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention for DMD versus standard of 
care in a UK setting. Model I was based on the DMDSAT, model II on stages of 
disease as defined in the DMD clinical care guidelines and model III on 
patients' ventilation status. The conceptual model structures were formulated in 
collaboration with three DMD experts.
RESULTS: All three models were judged to have good validity with regards to the 
appropriateness of the choice of modelling technique, conceptual representation 
of the disease, model input data and model outcomes. Across frameworks, lifetime 
direct medical costs with standard of care ranged between £217,510 and £284,640, 
total costs between £624,240 and £713,840, and total number of quality-adjusted 
life-years between 5.96 and 7.17.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a first version of a model for the economic evaluation 
of treatments for DMD based on the DMDSAT, as well as two alternative frameworks 
encompassing conventional staging of disease progression. Our findings should be 
helpful to inform health technology assessments and health economic programmes 
of future treatments for DMD.

BACKGROUND: Many guidelines advocate the use of shared decision making for men 
with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Decision aids can facilitate the process 
of shared decision making. Implicit in this approach is the idea that physicians 
understand which elements of treatment matter to patients. Little formal work 
exists to guide physicians or developers of decision aids in identifying these 
attributes. We use a mixed-methods technique adapted from marketing science, the 
'Voice of the Patient', to describe and identify treatment elements of value for 
men with localized prostate cancer.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 men treated for 
prostate cancer in the urology clinic of the West Los Angeles Veteran Affairs 
Medical Center. We used a qualitative analysis to generate themes in patient 
narratives, and a quantitative approach, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, 
to identify attributes of treatment that were most relevant to patients making 
decisions about prostate cancer.
RESULTS: We identified five 'traditional' prostate cancer treatment attributes: 
sexual dysfunction, bowel problems, urinary problems, lifespan, and others' 
opinions. We further identified two novel treatment attributes: a treatment's 
ability to validate a sense of proactivity and the need for an incision 
(separate from risks of surgery).
CONCLUSIONS: Application of a successful marketing technique, the 'Voice of the 
Customer', in a clinical setting elicits non-obvious attributes that highlight 
unique patient decision-making concerns. Use of this method in the development 
of decision aids may result in more effective decision support.

Viruses represent the most abundant life forms on the planet. Recent 
experimental and computational improvements have led to a dramatic increase in 
the number of viral genome sequences identified primarily from metagenomic 
samples. As a result of the expanding catalog of metagenomic viral sequences, 
there exists a need for a comprehensive computational platform integrating all 
these sequences with associated metadata and analytical tools. Here we present 
IMG/VR (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/vr/), the largest publicly available database of 
3908 isolate reference DNA viruses with 264 413 computationally identified viral 
contigs from >6000 ecologically diverse metagenomic samples. Approximately half 
of the viral contigs are grouped into genetically distinct quasi-species 
clusters. Microbial hosts are predicted for 20 000 viral sequences, revealing 
nine microbial phyla previously unreported to be infected by viruses. Viral 
sequences can be queried using a variety of associated metadata, including 
habitat type and geographic location of the samples, or taxonomic classification 
according to hallmark viral genes. IMG/VR has a user-friendly interface that 
allows users to interrogate all integrated data and interact by comparing with 
external sequences, thus serving as an essential resource in the viral genomics 
community.

In patients with renal cancer, brain metastasis is associated with poor survival 
and high morbidity. Poor life expectancy is often associated with widespread 
extracranial metastases. In such patients, a multidisciplinary approach is 
paramount. Brain metastases-specific therapies may include surgery, 
radiosurgery, conventional radiation and targeted therapies (TT) or a 
combination of these treatments. Some factors are important prognostically when 
choosing the best strategy: performance status, the number, size and location of 
brain metastases, the extension of systemic metastases and a well-controlled 
primary tumour. Failure of chemical therapy has always been attributed to an 
intact blood-brain barrier and acquired drug resistance by renal cancer cells. 
Recent studies have demonstrated objective responses with TT in a variety of 
cancer types, including renal cancer. In most cases, these agents have been used 
in combination and in conjunction with whole-brain radiation therapy and 
radiosurgery. Local control appears to be better with the combined method if the 
patient has a good performance status and may improve overall survival. This 
review summarizes current literature data on multidisciplinary approach in the 
management of renal brain metastasis with radiation, surgery and TT with an 
emphasis on potential better outcomes with a combination of current treatment 
methods.

OBJECTIVES: Ophthalmologic disease in patients with acute leukemia occurs due to 
primary leukemic infiltration (involvement), or secondary to the disease and its 
treatment. In recent years the life expectancy of acute leukemia patients has 
increased with the advent of modern therapies. The present study aimed to 
determine the incidence of ocular manifestations in children with acute 
leukemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 120 patients diagnosed with acute 
leukemia at Başkent University Hospital, Pediatric Hematology Department between 
1995 and 2010. All the patients were examined by an ophthalmologist via direct 
and indirect ophthalmoscopy.
RESULTS: Among the patients, 83 (69.2%) were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia, 35 (29.1%) with acute myeloblastic leukemia, and 2 (1.7%) with 
mixed-lineage leukemia. In all, 58 ophthalmic manifestations were noted in 41 
patients (34.2%). In our patients, 12 ophthalmologic involvements were present 
at admission and 46 ocular findings occurred during follow-up. The incidence of 
these manifestations increased with age.
CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologic manifestations were not correlated with gender, 
hematological parameters at disease onset, type of leukemia, or the frequency of 
relapse and survival. To more clearly determine the effect of ophthalmologic 
manifestations on the prognosis of leukemia, larger scale and multi-center 
studies are needed.

The development of new antimalarial compounds remains a pivotal part of the 
strategy for malaria elimination. Recent large-scale phenotypic screens have 
provided a wealth of potential starting points for hit-to-lead campaigns. One 
such public set is explored, employing an open source research mechanism in 
which all data and ideas were shared in real time, anyone was able to 
participate, and patents were not sought. One chemical subseries was found to 
exhibit oral activity but contained a labile ester that could not be replaced 
without loss of activity, and the original hit exhibited remarkable sensitivity 
to minor structural change. A second subseries displayed high potency, including 
activity within gametocyte and liver stage assays, but at the cost of low 
solubility. As an open source research project, unexplored avenues are clearly 
identified and may be explored further by the community; new findings may be 
cumulatively added to the present work.

Iron-overloaded β-thalassaemia major (BTM) children have high risk of delayed 
sexual/physical maturation, liver/heart diseases and reduced life expectancy. 
The lifelong need to use iron chelators, their unpleasant administration, side 
effects and lack of awareness regarding iron overload risks all hamper BTM 
patient compliance to iron chelators. This study evaluated the impact of 
clinical pharmacist-provided services on the outcome of iron-overloaded BTM 
children. Forty-eight BTM children were randomly assigned to either control 
group, who received standard medical care, or intervention group, who received 
standard medical care plus clinical pharmacist-provided services. Services 
included detection of drug-related problems (DRPs) and their management, patient 
education regarding disease nature and iron chelators, as well as providing 
patient-tailored medication charts. After six months of study implementation, 
there was a highly significant difference between the control and intervention 
groups in serum ferritin (SF) (mean: 3871 versus 2362, μg/l, p = 0.0042), 
patient healthcare satisfaction (median: 24.47 versus 90.29, p < 0.0001) and 
quality of life (QoL) (median: 49.84 versus 63.51, p = 0.0049). The intervention 
group showed a decline from baseline to the end of study in DRPs (64-4), the 
number of non-compliant patients (24-3) and mean SF levels (3949-2362 μg/l, p < 
0.0001). Clinical pharmacist-provided services can positively impact the outcome 
of BTM children.

PURPOSE: This study evaluates the selection, use, and risks of permanent and 
retrievable inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) in patients who have undergone 
organ transplantation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-center retrospective review of 35 patients who had 
an IVCF placed following organ transplantation. Patient demographics, IVCF 
indication, and eligibility for retrieval were reviewed. Computed tomography 
(CT) studies showing the filter (n=22) were evaluated independently for IVCF 
adverse effects.
RESULTS: Thirty-two (91%) of 35 patients had retrievable IVCFs placed while 
three (9%) patients received permanent IVCFs. Filter retrieval was indicated in 
three of the 32 patients receiving retrievable filters and was performed in two 
cases. Patients were ineligible for retrieval due to short life expectancy, 
complications/contraindications to anticoagulation, extended filter dwell time, 
lost to follow-up, and undetermined therapeutic value of anticoagulation.
CONCLUSION: Current practices of filter placement usually dictate placing a 
retrievable IVCF in transplant patients. However, transplant patients are 
unlikely to be eligible for filter retrieval especially in situations of 
advanced age and comorbidities. Given the low incidence of eligibility for 
retrieval in this patient population, these results suggest preferential 
placement of permanent filters may reduce the potential morbidity due to 
filter-related complications, such as strut perforation, in transplant patients.

BACKGROUND: Fragility fractures are fractures that result from mechanical forces 
that would not ordinarily result in fracture.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates 
[alendronic acid (Fosamax® and Fosamax® Once Weekly, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd), 
risedronic acid (Actonel® and Actonel Once a Week®, Warner Chilcott UK Ltd), 
ibandronic acid (Bonviva®, Roche Products Ltd) and zoledronic acid (Aclasta®, 
Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd)] for the prevention of fragility fracture and 
to assess their cost-effectiveness at varying levels of fracture risk.
DATA SOURCES: For the clinical effectiveness review, six electronic databases 
and two trial registries were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science and 
BIOSIS Previews, Clinicaltrials.gov and World Health Organization International 
Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Searches were limited by date from 2008 until 
September 2014.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of 
effectiveness studies were conducted. A review of published economic analyses 
was undertaken and a de novo health economic model was constructed. Discrete 
event simulation was used to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for each bisphosphonate treatment strategy and a strategy of 
no treatment for a simulated cohort of patients with heterogeneous 
characteristics. The model was populated with effectiveness evidence from the 
systematic review and NMA. All other parameters were estimated from published 
sources. A NHS and Personal Social Services perspective was taken, and costs and 
benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Fracture risk was estimated from 
patient characteristics using the QFracture® (QFracture-2012 open source 
revision 38, Clinrisk Ltd, Leeds, UK) and FRAX® (web version 3.9, University of 
Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) tools. The relationship between fracture risk and 
incremental net benefit (INB) was estimated using non-parametric regression. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and scenario analyses were used to 
assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: Forty-six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the 
clinical effectiveness systematic review, with 27 RCTs providing data for the 
fracture NMA and 35 RCTs providing data for the femoral neck bone mineral 
density (BMD) NMA. All treatments had beneficial effects on fractures versus 
placebo, with hazard ratios varying from 0.41 to 0.92 depending on treatment and 
fracture type. The effects on vertebral fractures and percentage change in BMD 
were statistically significant for all treatments. There was no evidence of a 
difference in effect on fractures between bisphosphonates. A statistically 
significant difference in the incidence of influenza-like symptoms was 
identified from the RCTs for zoledronic acid compared with placebo. Reviews of 
observational studies suggest that upper gastrointestinal symptoms are 
frequently reported in the first month of oral bisphosphonate treatment, but 
pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials found no statistically significant 
difference. A strategy of no treatment was estimated to have the maximum INB for 
patients with a 10-year QFracture risk under 1.5%, whereas oral bisphosphonates 
provided maximum INB at higher levels of risk. However, the PSA suggested that 
there is considerable uncertainty regarding whether or not no treatment is the 
optimal strategy until the QFracture score is around 5.5%. In the model using 
FRAX, the mean INBs were positive for all oral bisphosphonate treatments across 
all risk categories. Intravenous bisphosphonates were estimated to have lower 
INBs than oral bisphosphonates across all levels of fracture risk when estimated 
using either QFracture or FRAX.
LIMITATIONS: We assumed that all treatment strategies are viable alternatives 
across the whole population.
CONCLUSIONS: Bisphosphonates are effective in preventing fragility fractures. 
However, the benefit-to-risk ratio in the lowest-risk patients may be debatable 
given the low absolute QALY gains and the potential for adverse events. We plan 
to extend the analysis to include non-bisphosphonate therapies.

Children are at a greater risk than adults of developing cancer after being 
exposed to ionizing radiation. Because of their developing bodies and long life 
expectancy post-exposure, children require specific attention in the aftermath 
of nuclear accidents and when radiation is used for diagnosis or treatment 
purposes. In this review, we discuss the carcinogenic potential of pediatric 
exposures to ionizing radiation from accidental, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
modalities. Particular emphasis is given to leukemia and thyroid cancers as 
consequences of accidental exposures. We further discuss the evidence of cancers 
that arise as a result of radiotherapy and conclude the review with a summary on 
the available literature on the links between computer tomography (CT) and 
carcinogenesis. Appropriate actions taken to mitigate or minimize the negative 
health effects of pediatric exposures to ionizing radiation and future 
considerations are discussed.

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Treatment for adrenal insufficiency (AI) remains 
suboptimal. Despite glucocorticoid replacement, patients with AI have reduced 
life expectancy and quality of life. This study aimed to describe the spectrum 
of management of glucocorticoid replacement in patients with AI enrolled in the 
European Adrenal Insufficiency Registry (EU-AIR).
DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: EU-AIR is a prospective, multinational, 
multicentre, observational study initiated in August 2012 to monitor the 
long-term safety of glucocorticoid replacement in routine clinical practice in 
Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
NCT01661387). This analysis included 1166 patients with primary and secondary AI 
(mean disease duration 16·1 ± 11·6 years) receiving long-term glucocorticoid 
replacement therapy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Glucocorticoid type, dose, frequency and treatment regimen 
were examined.
RESULTS: Most patients (87·4%) were receiving hydrocortisone. The most common 
dose range, taken by 42·2% of patients, was 20 to <25 mg/day; however, 12·6% 
were receiving doses of ≥30 mg/day. Hydrocortisone was being taken once daily by 
5·5%, twice daily by 48·7%, three times daily by 43·6% and four times daily by 
2·1%. Patients with primary AI received higher replacement doses than those with 
secondary AI (23·4 ± 8·9 and 19·6 ± 5·9 mg/day, respectively). Twenty-five 
different regimens were being used to deliver a daily hydrocortisone dose of 20 
mg.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown significant heterogeneity in the type, dose, 
frequency and timing of glucocorticoid replacement in real-world clinical 
practice. This reflects dose individualization based on patient symptoms and 
lifestyle in the absence of data supporting the optimal regimen.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Hepatitis B Vaccination Strategies to Prevent 
Perinatal Transmission in North Korea: Selective Vaccination vs. Universal 
Vaccination.

BACKGROUND: To tackle the high prevalence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 
in North Korea, it is essential that birth doses of HBV vaccines should be 
administered within 24 hours of birth. As the country fails to provide a Timely 
Birth Dose (TBD) of HBV vaccine, the efforts of reducing the high prevalence of 
HBV have been significantly hampered.
METHODS: To examine the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies to prevent 
perinatal transmission of HBV in North Korea, we established a decision tree 
with a Markov model consisting of selective, universal, and the country's 
current vaccination program against HBV. The cost-effectiveness analysis was 
performed from societal and payer's perspectives and evaluated by Disability 
Adjusted Life Year (DALY).
RESULTS: The results suggest that introducing the universal vaccination would 
prevent 1,866 cases of perinatal infections per 100,000 of the birth cohort of 
2013. Furthermore, 900 cases of perinatal infections per 100,000 could be 
additionally averted if switching to the selective vaccination. The current 
vaccination is a dominated strategy both from the societal and payer's 
perspective. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) between universal 
and selective vaccination is $267 from the societal perspective and is reported 
as $273 from the payer's perspective.
CONCLUSION: Based on the assumption that the 2012 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
per capita in North Korea, $582.6 was set for cost-effectiveness criteria, the 
result of this study indicates that selective vaccination may be a highly 
cost-effective strategy compared to universal vaccination.

BACKGROUND: An increasing number of people require help to manage their weight. 
The NHS recommends weight loss advice by general practitioners and/or a referral 
to a practice nurse. Although this is helpful for some, more effective 
approaches that can be disseminated economically on a large scale are needed.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether or not a task-based weight management programme 
[Weight Action Programme (WAP)] has better long-term effects than a 'best 
practice' intervention provided in primary care by practice nurses.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: General practices in east London, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and thirty adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 
≥ 30 kg/m2 or a BMI of ≥ 28 kg/m2 plus comorbidities were recruited from local 
general practices and via media publicity. Those who had a BMI of > 45 kg/m2, 
had lost > 5% of their body weight in the previous 6 months, were currently 
pregnant or taking psychiatric medications were excluded. Participants were 
randomised (2 : 1) to the WAP or nurse arms.
INTERVENTIONS: The WAP intervention was delivered in eight weekly group sessions 
that combined dietary and physical activity, advice and self-monitoring in a 
group-oriented intervention. The initial course was followed by 10 monthly group 
maintenance sessions open to all participants in this study arm. The practice 
nurse intervention (best usual care) consisted of four one-to-one sessions 
delivered over 8 weeks, and included standard advice on diet and physical 
activity based on NHS 'Change4Life' materials and motivational support.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was weight change at 12 
months. Secondary outcome measures included change in BMI, waist circumference 
and blood pressure, and proportion of participants losing at least 5% and 10% of 
baseline body weight. Staff collecting measurements at the 6- and 12-month 
follow-ups were blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was 
analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle, and included all 
participants with at least one recorded outcome at either 1, 2, 6 or 12 months. 
The analysis employed a mixed-effects linear regression model, adjusted for 
baseline weight, age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status and general practice. The 
European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels questionnaire was completed and 
used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) within the 
cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS: There were 330 participants (WAP arm, n = 221; nurse arm, n = 109; 72% 
women). A total of 291 (88%) participants (WAP arm, n = 194; nurse arm, n = 97) 
were included in the main analysis for the primary outcome. Weight loss at 12 
months was greater in the WAP arm than in the nurse intervention arm [-4.2 kg 
vs. -2.3 kg; difference -1.9 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.7 to -0.1 kg; 
p = 0.04]. Participants in the WAP arm were more likely than participants in the 
nurse arm to have lost at least 5% of their baseline body weight at 12 months 
(41% vs. 27%; odds ratio 14.61, 95% CI 2.32 to 91.96; p = 0.004). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for WAP over and above the nurse arm is 
£7742 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: A WAP delivered in general practice better promotes weight loss 
over 12 months than a best usual practice nurse-led weight loss programme.
LIMITATIONS: The trial recruited mostly women. Research is needed into factors 
that would make weight loss programmes more attractive to men.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN45820471.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to identify indications and 
predictors for subsequent surgeries in the same hip and to evaluate life 
expectancy following screw fixation of undisplaced femoral neck fractures (FNF). 
The study further aimed to determine the necessary follow-up time for future 
studies aiming to evaluate the treatment of such fractures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study with 
prospectively collected data including skeletally mature patients with 
undisplaced FNFs operated between 2005 and 2013. Gender, age at fracture, 
American Society of Anesthesiologists score, smoking status and excess use of 
alcohol were retrieved from electronical medical records. Further, complications 
leading to all consecutive reoperations were registered along with time from 
primary operation to all reoperations, type of procedure during subsequent 
surgeries and time of death.
RESULTS: 383 patients with a median (range) follow-up of 77 (23-125) months were 
identified. Within 1, 2 and 5 years from primary surgery, 8%, 17% and 21% 
respectively, had at least one subsequent surgery in the same hip. 10% of the 
patients underwent salvage arthroplasty, however, in long time survivors; 
conversion to arthroplasty was estimated in one out of four. Posterior tilt of 
the femoral head was a predictor for new surgeries due to instability of the 
bone-implant construct, but not for later avascular necrosis. For patients 70 
years or older, the one-year mortality in men was 32% with an expected survival 
of approx. 2.5 years, compared to 17% and 5.5 years in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Screw fixation of undisplaced femoral neck fractures appears to be 
a safe procedure in particular in the absence of a posterior tilt of the femoral 
head. Conversion to arthroplasty was estimated to occur in one out of four of 
long time survivors. Men have a particularly poor medical prognosis and should 
receive careful medical attention. In order to capture 80% of reoperations, 
clinical studies and register studies must have a follow-up time of at least two 
years.
