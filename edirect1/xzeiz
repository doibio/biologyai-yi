BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated prolonged survival 
with new upfront treatments in addition to standard androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) in men with de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We 
describe patient characteristics, time trends and regional differences in uptake 
of these new treatment strategies in clinical practice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This descriptive study consisted of men registered in the 
National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden from 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2022 
with de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer defined by the 
presence of metastases on imaging at the time of diagnosis. Life expectancy was 
calculated based on age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and a Drug Comorbidity 
Index.
RESULTS: Within 6 months from diagnosis, 57% (1,677/2,959) of men with de novo 
metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer and more than 3 years of life 
expectancy had received docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide and/or 
radiotherapy. Over time, there was a 2-fold increase in uptake of any added 
treatment, mainly driven by a 6-fold increase in use of abiraterone, 
enzalutamide or apalutamide, with little change in use of other treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Slightly more than half of men diagnosed with de novo metastatic 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer and a life expectancy of at least 3 years 
received additions to standard ADT as recommended by national guidelines in 
2019-2022 in Sweden. There was a 2-fold increase in use of these treatments 
during the study period; however, efforts to further increase adherence to 
guidelines are warranted.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) employs a multifaceted arsenal to elude host 
defense mechanisms, including those associated with autophagy and lysosome 
function. Within the realm of host-pathogen interactions, NCOR1, a 
well-recognized transcriptional co-repressor, is known to associate with a 
multitude of protein complexes to effect the repression of a diverse spectrum of 
genes. However, its role in regulating macroautophagy/autophagy, lysosome 
biogenesis, and, by extension, Mtb pathogenesis remains unexplored. The 
depletion of NCOR1 assumes a pivotal role in the control of the AMPK-MTOR-TFEB 
signaling axis, thereby fine-tuning cellular ATP homeostasis. This finely 
orchestrated adjustment further alters the profile of proteins involved in 
autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis through its master regulator, TFEB, 
culminating in the increased Mtb survival within the host milieu. Furthermore, 
the treatment of NCOR1-depleted cells with either rapamycin, antimycin A, or 
metformin demonstrates a capacity to restore the TFEB activity and LC3-II 
levels, consequently restoring the capacity of host cells to clear Mtb. 
Additionally, exogenous NCOR1 expression rescues the AMPK-MTOR-TFEB signaling 
axis and essentially the autophagic induction machinery. Overall, these findings 
demonstrate a crucial role of NCOR1 in regulating Mtb pathogenesis within 
myeloid cells and sheds light toward its involvement in the development of novel 
host-directed therapies.

Amyloid fibril formation is central to the pathology of many diseases, including 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Amyloid 
fibrils can also have functional and scaffolding roles, for example in bacterial 
biofilms, and have also been exploited as useful biomaterials. Despite being 
linear protein homopolymers, amyloid fibrils can exhibit significant structural 
and morphological polymorphism, making it relevant to study them on the single 
fibril level. We here introduce the concept of nanofluidic channel analysis to 
the study of single, fluorescently-labeled amyloid fibrils in solution, 
monitoring the extension and emission intensity of individual fibrils confined 
in nanochannels with a depth of 300 nm and a width that gradually increases from 
300 to 3000 nm. The change in fibril extension with channel width permitted 
accurate determination of the persistence length of individual fibrils using 
Odijk's theory for strongly confined polymers. The technique was applied to 
amyloid fibrils prepared from the Alzheimer's related peptide amyloid-β(1-42) 
and the Parkinson's related protein α-synuclein, obtaining mean persistence 
lengths of 5.9 ± 4.5 μm and 3.0 ± 1.6 μm, respectively. The broad distributions 
of fibril persistence lengths indicate that amyloid fibril polymorphism can 
manifest in their physical properties. Interestingly, the α-synuclein fibrils 
had lower persistence lengths than the amyloid-β(1-42) fibrils, despite being 
thicker. Furthermore, there was no obvious within-sample correlation between the 
fluorescence emission intensity per unit length of the labelled fibrils and 
their persistence lengths, suggesting that stiffness may not be proportional to 
thickness. We foresee that the nanofluidics methodology established here will be 
a useful tool to study amyloid fibrils on the single fibril level to gain 
information on heterogeneity in their physical properties and interactions.

BACKGROUND: Lolland-Falster Health Study (LOFUS) was a health examination survey 
that included self-administered questionnaires, clinical examinations, and the 
collection of biological samples, undertaken in 2016-2020 in a rural, 
socioeconomically deprived area with the lowest life expectancy in Denmark. The 
aim of this study was to examine the determinants of non-participation in LOFUS 
to evaluate the extent to which LOFUS data reflected the general population of 
the area.
METHODS: LOFUS invited randomly selected subjects together with their entire 
household. As determinants of non-participation, we analyzed age, sex, 
municipality of residency, citizenship, residency status, socioeconomic status, 
invitation type, and year of invitation. Relative risk regression was used to 
estimate the association between determinants and non-participation rate, 
mutually adjusted for other determinants.
RESULTS: In total, 53,313 subjects were invited of whom 18,949 (36%) 
participated. In the multivariable analysis, men had a 3% higher 
non-participation rate than women; subjects with citizenship other than Danish 
had a 3% higher non-participation rate than Danes. In-migrants had 6% higher 
non-participation than long-term residents. Compared with self-supported 
subjects aged 30-64, both publicly supported subjects of this age and younger 
and older subjects had higher non-participation rates: 16%, 16%, and 13%, 
respectively. Compared with self-supported, long-term residents, publicly 
supported in-migrants had 23% higher non-participation.
CONCLUSIONS: Only about one third of subjects invited to LOFUS participated. 
Yet, this is a relatively high participation rate compared with other recent 
health examination surveys in Denmark. Furthermore, there was a relatively flat 
social gradient in the non-participation rate across the studied determinants.

BACKGROUND: Bempedoic acid (BA) is a small-molecule first-in-class of inhibitor 
of ATP citrate lyase that significantly lowers low-density lipoproteins 
cholesterol (LDL-c) in statin-intolerant and inadequate responders. Increased 
serum uric acid (SUA) levels and gout incidence have been described in 
BA-treated patients. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the 
safety of BA regarding SUA levels and gout in randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs).
METHODS: A search on 7 databases was performed from inception to May 4, 2023. 
RCTs of BA monotherapy or combination with other lipid-lowering treatment (LLT) 
in patients with increased LDL-c were included. Dual data extraction was 
performed with disagreements resolved through consensus. Due to the 
methodological purpose of this review risk-of-bias assessment of studies was not 
performed.
RESULTS: 6 Phase 3 RCTs (N = 17,975 patients of which 9,635 received BA) 9 Phase 
2 RCTs (N = 362 patients of which 170 received BA) and an open-label extension 
of a Phase 3 RCT were included. Gout and/or hyperuricemia were not mentioned as 
exclusion criteria, previous/current use of urate-lowering therapies (ULT) 
and/or colchicine and/or dietary patterns were not reported. Phase 3 RCTs: 2 
studies specified the number of patients experiencing hyperuricemia over the 
study period (BA: 4.9%-11%; placebo: 1.9%-5.6%) and the effect size was 
significant only in 1 study (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.3). Four RCTs reported a 
higher incidence of gout in the BA arm however, when we calculated the effect 
size, it was small and often not significant. Two studies reported 0 cases of 
gout. The paucity of information about SUA levels at baseline and/or at the end 
of follow-up do not allow us to quantify the effect sizes for BA-induced SUA 
elevation. Data on gout from Phase 2 RCTs is scant.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from phase 2 and 3 RCTs do not allow for confirming a clear 
association between BA and gout. It is conceivable that a careful assessment of 
SUA levels/history of gout at baseline and the concomitant use of urate-lowering 
agents may be instrumental to minimise the risk of new-onset gout/gout flares in 
patients treated with BA.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic was particularly difficult for individuals 
with mental disorders. Due to governmental restrictions, face-to-face offers for 
psychiatric outpatients like therapies, psychoeducational groups or relaxation 
courses were limited. Virtual reality (VR) might be a new possibility to support 
these patients by providing them with a home-based relaxation tool.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, 
and user satisfaction of a supportive therapy-accompanying, relaxation VR 
intervention in psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.
METHODS: The four-weeks VR intervention consisted of regular watching of 
relaxing videos in the participants' home environment. Sociodemographics, 
feasibility (frequency of use, user-friendliness), satisfaction (Client 
Satisfaction Questionnaire-8), depressive symptoms (Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9), quality of life (abbreviated World Health Organization Quality 
of Life assessment), and credibility and expectancy (Credibility Expectancy 
Questionnaire-8) were measured in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and a 
per-protocol (PP) analysis of completers.
RESULTS: In total, N = 40 patients participated in the study. Most of the 
participants in the ITT analysis (n = 30, 75.0%) used the VR device three or 
4 weeks. A majority of the N = 29 completers (PP: n = 18, 62.1%) used it all 
4 weeks. Most participants used the device two or more times a week (ITT: 
n = 30, 83.3%; PP: n = 26, 89.7%) and described the user-friendliness as rather 
or very easy (ITT: n = 33, 91.7%; PP: n = 26, 89.7%). User satisfaction was high 
(ITT: 19.42, SD = 4.08; PP: M = 20.00, SD = 4.19) and did not correlate with 
participants' sex or age (all p < 0.05). Depressive symptoms and psychological 
quality of life improved significantly from pre-to post-intervention (ITT and 
PP, all p < 0.05). Higher pre-intervention credibility significantly correlated 
with a better outcome of satisfaction (ITT and PP), depressive symptoms, 
physical, psychological, and social quality of life (PP; all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A supportive therapy-accompanying VR relaxation intervention is 
feasible and acceptable in a psychiatric outpatient setting. Due to the high 
satisfaction and user-friendliness, VR can be an easy to implement relaxation 
tool to support psychiatric outpatients.

Economic uncertainty and population health: insights from emerging markets and 
developing countries.

Liu L(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Accounting, School of Economics and Management, Nantong 
University, Nantong, China.

This study employs a Bayesian panel vector autoregressive model to examine the 
impact of economic uncertainty on public health, using an annual, country-level 
panel dataset of 103 emerging markets and developing countries spanning the 
years 1995 through 2019. The results from the full sample suggest that the 
immediate effects of heightened economic uncertainty on health are marginal, yet 
it may engender prolonged life expectancy and lowered mortality rates. The 
analysis unveils considerable heterogeneities among various country 
classifications. The health-enhancing effects of economic uncertainty are 
predominantly discernible in emerging markets, low-income and 
upper-middle-income countries. Additionally, a diminution in suicide rates, 
attributed to escalated economic uncertainty, is uniquely detected in 
upper-middle-income countries. Furthermore, economic growth and healthcare 
expenditure emerge as paramount determinants in bolstering overall population 
health, particularly in lower-middle-income countries. The detrimental effect of 
environmental pollution on health is more pronounced in emerging markets and 
middle-income nations. Excluding high-income countries, it is essential to 
emphasize the beneficial health outcomes resulting from financial development 
and globalization, as well as the deleterious effects of environmental 
pollution. Lastly, several policy implications aligned with the findings are 
outlined, providing a roadmap for decision-makers in these diverse economies to 
promote better health outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Given its profound and transversal impact, the COVID-19 pandemic 
in 2020 marked a deep point of division in how people make sense of the world 
and their lives. The consequences of this event were remarkable, especially for 
populations already facing vulnerability, exclusion, and discrimination. In 
Italy, over 3 million people (5.2% of the entire population) have a disability 
due to health issues or severe limitations that prevent them from performing 
daily activities. Although the COVID-19 health emergency aggravated and 
amplified these problems, research and studies investigating the incidence of 
psychological distress and the role of psychological resources for people with 
disabilities in the aftermath of the pandemic are still to be implemented. For 
these reasons, the Department of Psychology conducted a study on behalf of the 
Italian Government to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social, 
psychological, and economic wellbeing of Italians with disabilities.
METHODS: The aim was to assess the consequences of the pandemic on this 
population, especially the impacts related to the lockdowns and preventive 
measures, and to evaluate the protective role that could be played by 
psychological resources such as resilience, future orientation, and career 
adaptability in a Life Design perspective. With the collaboration of local, 
regional, and national associations for people with disability, an anonymous, 
online self-report questionnaire was distributed to 403 persons with 
disabilities in Italy.
RESULTS: Results showed a strong relationship between the levels of 
psychological resources and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION: In line with studies in international literature regarding the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with disabilities, this research 
highlights the extension of this period's impacts on this population's 
psychological wellbeing. Moreover, this study amplifies the urgent call for 
action and research in promoting Life Design psychological resources, given 
their positive and protective role in preserving and increasing people's 
wellbeing.

Enablers and Hindrances of Lifestyle Changes Among Patients With Atrial 
Fibrillation: A Qualitative Study.

Liu M, Zhang Q, Liu L, Liu W.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) seriously affects the health status and 
quality of life of affected patients. However, the lifestyle changes recommended 
by the guidelines for patients are not ideal. Hence, understanding the factors 
that promote and hinder healthy behavior changes in patients with AF is crucial 
for self-management.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to understand the factors enabling and 
hindering health behaviors in patients with AF and to provide a reference for 
promoting health management among these patients.
METHODS: Using the purposive sampling method, 22 patients with AF admitted to 
the Cardiac Center of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, 
from March 2021 to June 2021 were selected for in-depth face-to-face interviews. 
The thematic analysis method was used to summarize and refine the themes.
RESULTS: The following 2 themes and 15 subthemes were eventually extracted by 
analyzing and summarizing the interview data. The 7 factors facilitating health 
behaviors in patients with AF were risk perception, outcome expectancy, 
behavioral intention, action plan, response plan, self-efficacy, and social 
support. There were 8 hindering factors: personal preferences and habits, 
specific customary culture, weak self-control, accessibility of exercise 
conditions, symptom-related distress, cognitive weakness, multiple medication 
use, and insufficient awareness of condition monitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: The factors affecting health behaviors in patients with AF are 
complex, and healthcare providers should reinforce the facilitators of health 
behaviors in these patients and provide them with targeted interventions against 
hindering factors. Results can be used to develop health behavior intervention 
programs for patients with AF.

Vibriosis and Streptococcosis are the most important bacterial diseases that 
infect Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) in various stages of its life cycle. 
Vaccination is a cost-effective strategy to prevent the occurrence of infectious 
diseases and increase sustainability in the aquaculture industry. This study was 
aimed to develop and evaluate a killed polyvalent vaccine against Vibrio 
harveyi, V. alginolyticus and Streptococcus iniae, delivered by intraperitoneal 
injection in Asian seabass. The fish were divided into three groups with 60 fish 
in triplicate: I) a control group injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 
II) a group vaccinated by polyvalent vaccine (V. alginolyticus + V. harveyi + S. 
iniae) and III) a group vaccinated with the same polyvalent vaccine plus an oral 
booster. Immunological parameters and antibody titer were measured before and at 
three, five-, and eight-weeks post-vaccination. The efficacy of the killed 
vaccine was assessed five weeks post-vaccination by challenging with each 
isolate separately. The vaccinated groups had higher survival rate than control 
group. The highest relative percentage survival rate, 85.71 ± 3.57 % was 
observed in group III when challenged with V. harveyi. The vaccinated fish 
produced significantly higher antibody titers against V. alginolyticus, V. 
harveyi and S. iniae than the control group (P < 0.05). Non-specific immune 
parameters were significantly enhanced in the vaccinated groups, especially

administration of a killed polyvalent vaccine can effectively protect Asian 
seabass against V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi and S. iniae.

BACKGROUND: The design of clinical trials in rare diseases is often complicated 
by a lack of real-world translational knowledge. Fibrodysplasia ossificans 
progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal 
malformations and progressive heterotopic ossification (HO). Palovarotene is a 
selective retinoic acid receptor gamma agonist. Here, we describe the 
methodology of three studies in the palovarotene clinical development program in 
FOP and discuss insights that could inform future research, including endpoint 
suitability and the impact of trial design.
METHODS: PVO-1A-001 (NCT02322255) was a prospective, protocol-specified, 
longitudinal FOP natural history study (NHS). PVO-1A-201 (NCT02190747) was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial; PVO-1A-202 
(NCT02279095) was its open-label extension. Trial designs, including treatment 
regimens and imaging assessments, were refined between PVO-1A-201 and 
PVO-‍1A-202, and within PVO-1A-202, based on emerging data as the studies 
progressed. Palovarotene doses were administered using a flare-up treatment 
regimen (higher dose for 2/4 weeks, followed by lower dose for 4/≥8 weeks; from 
flare-up onset), with or without accompanying chronic (daily) treatment. 
Flare-up and disease progression outcomes were assessed, including incidence and 
volume of new HO during flare-ups and/or annually, as well as other clinical, 
patient-reported, and exploratory outcomes. Safety was monitored throughout all 
studies.
RESULTS: Overall, 114 and 58 individuals with FOP were enrolled in the NHS and 
phase II trials, respectively. Results of the NHS and PVO-1A-201 were published 
in 2022; complete results of PVO-1A-202 will be publicly available in due 
course. Together the studies yielded important information on endpoint 
suitability, including that low-dose whole-body computed tomography was the 
optimum imaging modality for assessing HO progression annually and that long 
study durations are needed to detect substantial changes in functional and 
patient-reported outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: A flexible clinical development program is necessary for 
underexplored rare diseases to overcome the many challenges faced. Here, the NHS 
provided a longitudinal evaluation of FOP progression and interventional trials 
were based on emerging data. The studies described informed the design and 
endpoints implemented in the phase III MOVE trial (NCT03312634) and provide a 
foundation for future clinical trial development.

BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, muscle-degenerative 
disease predominantly affecting males. Natural history models capture the full 
disease pathway under current care and combine with estimates of new 
interventions' effects to assess cost-effectiveness by health technology 
decision-makers. These models require mortality estimates throughout a patient's 
lifetime, but rare disease datasets typically contain relatively few patients 
with short follow-ups. Alternative (published) sources of mortality data may 
therefore be required.
METHODS: The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) was evaluated as a 
source of mortality and natural history data for future economic evaluations of 
health technologies for DMD and rare diseases in general in the UK population. 
This retrospective longitudinal cohort study provides flexible parametric 
estimates of mortality rates and survival probabilities in the current UK DMD 
population through primary/secondary records in the CPRD since 1990. It also 
investigates clinically significant milestones such as corticosteroid use, 
spinal surgery, and cardiomyopathy in these patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1121 male patients were included in the study, observed from 
0.7 to 48.9 years. Median life expectancy was 25.64 years (95% confidence 
interval 24.73, 26.47), consistent with previous global estimates. This has 
improved to 26.47 (25.16, 27.89) years in patients born after 1990. The median 
ages at corticosteroid initiation, spinal surgery, ventilation, and 
cardiomyopathy diagnosis were 6.06 years (5.77, 6.29), 14.79 years (14.29, 
15.09), 16.97 years (16.50, 18.31), and 15.26 years (14.22, 16.70), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of mortality in UK-based DMD patients are age-specific in 
a uniquely large and nationally representative sample from the CPRD.

Benign Gastric Outlet Obstruction.

Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a clinical syndrome traditionally managed by 
surgical gastrojejunostomy or enteral stenting. The surgical approach is 
burdened with a high rate of adverse events (AEs), while enteral stenting has a 
limited long-term clinical effectiveness, with the need for repeat procedures. 
The availability of lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMSs) has resulted a shift in 
the treatment paradigm of GOO. Indeed, endoscopists are now able to create a 
stable anastomosis between the stomach and small bowel under endosonographic 
guidance. EUS-guided gastro-enteroanastomosis (EUS-GE) has the theoretical 
advantage of a durable luminal patency resulting from stent placement away from 
the site of obstruction, free from surgical-related AEs. This approach could be 
especially valuable in terminally ill patients with a limited life expectancy. 
The present paper reviews procedural techniques and clinical outcomes of EUS-GE 
in the context of both malignant and benign GOOs.

BACKGROUND: In addition to pharmacological prevention, chemotherapy-induced 
nausea and vomiting (CINV) can be mitigated through patient education; written 
supporting materials can be beneficial.
METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled trial which randomly assigned patients 
undergoing first chemotherapy cycle to receive oral information regarding CINV 
prevention and management (control arm) or oral information plus an informative 
booklet (experimental arm). Overall, 384 cancer patients fulfilling the 
following inclusion criteria were enrolled: age ≥18 years; life expectancy ≥6 
months; no cognitive impairment; written informed consent. After the first 
cycle, CINV occurrence and its impact on daily activities were assessed using 
the Functional Living Index Emesis (FLIE).
RESULTS: Severe nausea was self-reported by 3.0% and 10.8% of patients in the 
experimental and control group, respectively (difference: 7.8%; 95% confidence 
interval: 2.3% to 13.1%). Moderate/high impact of nausea on daily activities was 
lower in patients also receiving the booklet than in the control group (4.2% and 
10.1%, respectively; difference: 5.9%; 95% confidence interval: 0.3% to 11.5%). 
Vomiting was not statistically different between study arms.
CONCLUSIONS: This integrated nursing approach was effective in aiding cancer 
patients in CINV self-management. Although the beneficial effect was moderate, 
this intervention demands minimal resources in terms of costs and time.

Cystic Fibrosis is a chronic disease affecting multiple systems, including the 
GI tract. Clinical manifestation in patients can start as early as infancy and 
vary across different age groups. With the advent of new, highly effective 
modulators, the life expectancy of PwCF has improved significantly. Various GI 
aspects of CF care, such as nutrition, are linked to an overall improvement in 
morbidity, lung function and the quality of life of PwCF. The variable clinical 
presentations and management of GI diseases in pediatrics and adults with CF 
should be recognized. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure efficient transfer of 
information between pediatric and adult providers for proper continuity of 
management and coordination of care at the time of transition. The transition of 
care is a challenging process for both patients and providers and currently 
there are no specific tools for GI providers to help ensure a smooth transition. 
In this review, we aim to highlight the crucial features of GI care at the time 
of transition and provide a checklist that can assist in ensuring an effective 
transition and ease the challenges associated with it.

(1) Background: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a crucial ligament in 
the knee joint. This study compares the differences in knee range of motion 
(ROM), knee proprioception error, balance, function, and quality of life (QOL) 
among participants with and without meniscus repair or partial meniscectomy nine 
months post ACL reconstruction. (2) Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 57 
male participants were selected through convenience sampling from a tertiary 
care hospital. Knee flexion and extension ROM were assessed using a digital 
goniometer; a digital inclinometer was used to assess knee proprioception error; 
the Y balance test was used to evaluate balance; the lower extremity functional 
scale (LEFS) was used to assess activity; and QOL was assessed using the ACLQOL 
questionnaire. (3) Results: There were no significant differences in outcomes 
except balance. The YB composite score had a moderate negative correlation with 
knee proprioception error with an R-value of -0.372 **. (4) Conclusions: Nine to 
12 months post ACL reconstruction, the isolated ACL reconstruction participants 
had better lower-quarter single-leg balance than those who underwent ACL 
reconstruction and meniscal repair or partial meniscectomy. The remaining 
parameters, like knee ROM, knee proprioception error, LEFS score, and ACLQOL 
scores, were similar between these two groups.

The Effect of Curing Conditions on the Service Life of 3D Printed Concrete 
Formwork.

Complex concrete elements are typically produced with lost formwork made out of 
timber or plastic. After usage, these timber or plastic panels are disposed of. 
This makes complex lost formwork a polluting and high-cost-inducing aspect of 
concrete construction. A possible solution for this problem could be 3D printing 
of concrete. This high degree of freedom construction process could easily be 
used to produce complex formwork. As the formwork stays in place, it has a 
function during and after the hardening of the inner concrete. Before hardening, 
the formwork keeps the fresh concrete in place. After hardening, the printed 
formwork takes the function of a concrete cover. The concrete cover protects the 
steel reinforcement against aggressive environmental substances such as 
chlorides and carbon dioxide. To properly execute this function, the printed 
material and the transition between printed material and inner concrete need to 
perform at least as well as the inner material. This experimental research 
investigates the usability of a 3D printed concrete mixture as a concrete cover 
in a combined concrete structure. The effect of the curing condition as well as 
two different surface finishing techniques of the printed formwork are taken 
into account. The effect of the different parameters is compared based on 
existing service life models. Results indicate that proper curing of the printed 
formwork is of key importance in order to obtain significant resistance against 
carbonation- and chloride-induced corrosion. Adjusting the nozzle with side 
trowels improves the resistance of the printed material against chloride 
intrusion and carbonation but has only a limited effect on the service life 
extension.

Anthracnose diseases, caused by Colletotrichum spp., are considered to be among 
the most destructive diseases that have a significant impact on the global 
production of strawberries. These diseases alone can cause up to 70% yield loss 
in North America. Colletotrichum spp. causes several disease symptoms on 
strawberry plants, including root, fruit, and crown rot, lesions on petioles and 
runners, and irregular black spots on the leaf. In many cases, a lower level of 
infection on foliage remains non-symptomatic (quiescent), posing a challenge to 
growers as these plants can be a significant source of inoculum for the fruiting 
field. Reliable detection methods for quiescent infection should play an 
important role in preventing infected plants' entry into the production system 
or guiding growers to take appropriate preventative measures to control the 
disease. This review aims to examine both conventional and emerging approaches 
for detecting anthracnose disease in the early stages of the disease cycle, with 
a focus on newly emerging techniques such as remote sensing, especially using 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with multispectral sensors. Further, we 
focused on the acutatum species complex, including the latest taxonomy, the 
complex life cycle, and the epidemiology of the disease. Additionally, we 
highlighted the extensive spectrum of management techniques against anthracnose 
diseases on strawberries and their challenges, with a special focus on new 
emerging sustainable management techniques that can be utilized in organic 
strawberry systems.

With the increase in global life expectancy, maintaining health into old age 
becomes a challenge, and research has thus concentrated on various strategies 
which aimed to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Aromatic plants stand out as 
promising sources of anti-aging compounds due to their secondary metabolites, 
particularly essential oils (EOs). The aim of this study was to ascribe to 
Ferulago lutea EO several biological activities that could be useful in the 
context of skin aging. The EO was obtained using hydrodistillation and 
characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The
