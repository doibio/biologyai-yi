BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with cervical spine fractures require optimal care. 
Treatment with a cervical collar or halo instead of surgical fixation may 
increase mortality. This investigation intends to describe the life expectancy 
after injury and evaluate the impact of surgical intervention on mortality.
METHODS: Patients ≥65 years, with traumatic cervical spine fractures without 
cord injury were identified in the 1995-2009 California Office of Statewide 
Health and Planning database. Those with halo placement or surgical spine 
fixation were identified. Primary outcome was death, studied at the initial 
admission, 30 days, 1 year, and the entire study period. Univariate and 
multivariate regressions were performed to identify predictors of death. 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to describe life expectancy after injury.
RESULTS: 10 938 patients were identified. Mortality rate was 10% during the 
initial admission, 28% at 1 year and 50% during the entire study period. A halo 
was placed in 14% of patients and 12% underwent surgical fixation. Mortality 
rates during the initial admission were 11% for patients without an 
intervention, 7% with halo placement and 6% with surgical fixation; at 1 year, 
these increased to 30%, 26% and 19%, respectively. At 1 year, more than one in 
four patients above 75 years of age will die.At 1 year spine fixation, female 
gender and admission to a trauma center predicted a lower risk of death at 
1 year (OR 0.59, 0.68; p<0.001 and OR 0.89; p=0.02, respectively). Having a 
complication, fall mechanism, and traumatic brain injury (OR 1.84, 1.33, 
1.37; p<0.001, respectively) were predictors of a higher risk of death. Halo use 
had no impact on death at 1 year (OR 0.98; p=0.77).
DISCUSSION: Mortality rates after cervical spine fracture in the elderly is 
high. Surgical fixation is associated with improved survival; remaining true 
after adjusting for age and comorbidities; suggesting that surgical fixation may 
improve outcomes in the elderly.

Residential aged care (RAC) is a significant provider of end-of-life care for 
people aged 65 years and older. Rural residents perceive themselves as different 
to their urban counterparts. Most studies describing place of death (PoD) in RAC 
are quantitative and reflect an urban voice. Using a mixed-methods design, this 
paper examines the PoD of 80 RAC residents (15 short-stay residents who died in 
RAC during respite or during an attempted step-down transition from hospital to 
home, and 65 permanent residents), within the rural Snowy Monaro region, 
Australia, who died between 1 February 2015 and 31 May 2016. Death data were 
collected from local funeral directors, RAC facilities, one multi-purpose heath 
service and obituary notices in the local media. The outcome variable was PoD: 
RAC, local hospital or out-of-region tertiary hospital. For the permanent RAC 
residents, the outcome of interest was dying in RAC or dying in hospital. Cross 
tabulations by PoD and key demographic data were performed. Pearson Chi squared 
tests and exact p-values were used to determine if any of the independent 
variables were associated with PoD. Using an ethnographic approach, data were 
collected from 12 face-to-face, open-ended interviews with four RAC residents, 
with a life expectancy of ≤6 months, and six family caregivers. Interviews were 
audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Fifty-one (78.5%) of the 
permanent residents died in RAC; 21.5% died in hospital. Home was the initial 
preferred POD for most interviewed participants; most eventually accepted the 
transfer to RAC. Long-term residents considered RAC to be their "home"-a 
familiar place, and an important part of their rural community. The participants 
did not consider a transfer to hospital to be necessary for end-of-life care. 
Further work is required to explore further the perspectives of rural RAC 
residents and their families, and if transfers to hospital are avoidable.

osteogenesis imperfecta.

AIM: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease characterized by bones 
fragility and progressive deformity. Life expectancy is reduced in the 
non-lethal most severe type III form before the age of 10 years. The main cause 
of death in OI is respiratory insufficiency resulting from impaired thoracic 
function worsened by ribcage deformity and scoliosis.
METHODS: We used opto-electronic plethysmography to study chest geometry, the 
ventilatory, and the thoraco-abdominal pattern at rest in supine position in 
children younger than 10 years. Radiographic measurements were used to describe 
spinal deformity.
RESULTS: Eight severe OI (sOI), seven affected by other moderate forms (mOI), 
and nine healthy controls (CTR) were analyzed. sOI were characterized by Pectus 
carinatum (sternal angle: 165.2°, CTR: 183.1°; P < 0.01), rapid and shallow 
breathing (RSBi: 267.4 L-1 min-1 , CTR: 150.7 L-1 min-1 ; P < 0.05) and reduced 
pulmonary rib cage contribution to tidal volume (5.1%, CTR: 14.6%; P < 0.001) 
that evolved with age approaching the paradoxical inspiratory inward movement 
previously found in adults. mOI showed almost normal ventilatory pattern (RSBi: 
189.2-1 min-1 ) and absence of sternal deformity (sternal angle: 176.8°). 
Platyspondyly and kyphosis were common features in all OI children.
CONCLUSION: An altered breathing pattern in severe OI is present since childhood 
and it worsens with age. This is caused by the combination of pectus carinatum, 
brittle ribs and spinal deformity that put the ribcage muscles in mechanical 
disadvantage. These results suggest that in severe OI the assessment of the 
respiratory function should start in early childhood in order to try to reduce 
the incidence of premature death.

BACKGROUND: People carrying out clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) 
to empty their bladder often suffer repeated urinary tract infections (UTIs). 
Continuous once-daily, low-dose antibiotic treatment (antibiotic prophylaxis) is 
commonly advised but knowledge of its effectiveness is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefit, harms and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic 
prophylaxis to prevent UTIs in people who perform CISC.
DESIGN: Parallel-group, open-label, patient-randomised 12-month trial of 
allocated intervention with 3-monthly follow-up. Outcome assessors were blind to 
allocation.
SETTING: UK NHS, with recruitment of patients from 51 sites.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and four adults performing CISC and predicted to 
continue for ≥ 12 months who had suffered at least two UTIs in the previous year 
or had been hospitalised for a UTI in the previous year.
INTERVENTIONS: A central randomisation system using random block allocation set 
by an independent statistician allocated participants to the experimental group 
[once-daily oral antibiotic prophylaxis using either 50 mg of nitrofurantoin, 
100 mg of trimethoprim (Kent Pharmaceuticals, Ashford, UK) or 250 mg of 
cefalexin (Sandoz Ltd, Holzkirchen, Germany); n = 203] or the control group of 
no prophylaxis (n = 201), both for 12 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome was relative frequency of 
symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTI. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by cost per 
UTI avoided. The secondary measures were microbiologically proven UTI, 
antimicrobial resistance, health status and participants' attitudes to 
antibiotic use.
RESULTS: The frequency of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTI was reduced by 48% 
using prophylaxis [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.44 to 0.61; n = 361]. Reduction in microbiologically proven UTI was similar 
(IRR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.60; n = 361). Absolute reduction in UTI episodes 
over 12 months was from a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1-4) in the 
no-prophylaxis group (n = 180) to 1 (0-2) in the prophylaxis group (n = 181). 
The results were unchanged by adjustment for days at risk of UTI and the 
presence of factors giving higher risk of UTI. Development of antimicrobial 
resistance was seen more frequently in pathogens isolated from urine and 
Escherichia coli from perianal swabs in participants allocated to antibiotic 
prophylaxis. The use of prophylaxis incurred an extra cost of £99 to prevent one 
UTI (not including costs related to increased antimicrobial resistance). The 
emotional and practical burden of CISC and UTI influenced well-being, but health 
status measured over 12 months was similar between groups and did not 
deteriorate significantly during UTI. Participants were generally unconcerned 
about using antibiotics, including the possible development of antimicrobial 
resistance.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of blinding may have led participants in each group to use 
different thresholds to trigger reporting and treatment-seeking for UTI.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large randomised trial, conducted in accordance 
with best practice, demonstrate clear benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis in 
terms of reducing the frequency of UTI for people carrying out CISC. Antibiotic 
prophylaxis use appears safe for individuals over 12 months, but the emergence 
of resistant urinary pathogens may prejudice longer-term management of recurrent 
UTI and is a public health concern. Future work includes longer-term studies of 
antimicrobial resistance and studies of non-antibiotic preventative strategies.

The gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE) varies substantially in EU 28 Member 
States. This paper addresses the question of whether gender inequality affects 
the GGLE as well as life expectancy (LE) in both genders. We conducted an 
ecological study and used the gender inequality index (GII) developed by the 
United Nations as well as the gender difference in LE in 2015. We found a 
correlation between GGLE and GII (r2=0.180) and between GII and LE of 0.418 
(women) and 0.430 (men). Gender equality policies are still necessary and will 
have an effect on women's as well as men's health.

We investigated the difference in relationship between muscle strength and 
quality of life (QOL)/fatigue in long-term cancer survivors and healthy 
subjects. Thirty-six cancer survivors and 29 healthy subjects were assessed for 
body composition and bone status at the calcaneus using the Osteo Sono 
Assessment Index. Muscle strength was evaluated via handgrip and knee extensor 
strength. Health-related QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcome Study 
36-item Short-Form Health Survey. Fatigue was measured using the brief fatigue 
inventory. Cancer survivors exhibited lower QOL scores in the physical 
functioning, physical role function, bodily pain and general health domains 
(p < .05). Grip and knee extension muscle strength in cancer survivors was 
positively correlated with the physical function and bodily pain of QOL 
(p < .05). The usual fatigue subscale score was only significantly higher in 
cancer survivors than in healthy subjects (p < .05). However, there were no 
correlations between muscle strength and fatigue in cancer survivors. Our 
results showed that muscle strength was an important factor for improving QOL in 
cancer survivors. We believe that the findings of this study will be relevant in 
the context of planning rehabilitation for cancer survivors.

Surgical removal of an isolated femoral metastasis of uterine cervical squamous 
cell carcinoma: a case report and review of the literature.

Ida T, Goto T, Motoi T, Nagai I, Matsubara S, Fujiwara H, Kohyama A.

A bone metastasis from uterine cervical cancer normally indicates short life 
expectancy. Resection of the lesion is therefore palliative. The authors 
consider herein whether surgical resection can promote disease control while 
improving quality of life. A 33-year-old woman -presenting FIGO Stage IB 1 
uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma underwent a radical hysterectomy and 
pelvic irradiation. Twenty-two-months later, a solitary femoral metastasis was 
detected. Given the pain, imminent bone fracture, the patient's relative youth, 
absence of other metastases, and complete control of the primary lesion, wide 
excision of the lesion, and reconstruction were performed. Sixteen months later, 
she was disease-free and ambulatory using a cane. The findings of both the 
present case and the review showed that patients were disease-free for over one 
year after surgery, suggesting that resection may assist disease control as well 
as improve patients' quality of life.

Poverty dynamics, poverty thresholds and mortality: An age-stage Markovian 
model.

Recent studies have examined the risk of poverty throughout the life course, but 
few have considered how transitioning in and out of poverty shape the dynamic 
heterogeneity and mortality disparities of a cohort at each age. Here we use 
state-by-age modeling to capture individual heterogeneity in crossing one of 
three different poverty thresholds (defined as 1×, 2× or 3× the "official" 
poverty threshold) at each age. We examine age-specific state structure, the 
remaining life expectancy, its variance, and cohort simulations for those above 
and below each threshold. Survival and transitioning probabilities are 
statistically estimated by regression analyses of data from the Health and 
Retirement Survey RAND data-set, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. 
Using the results of these regression analyses, we parameterize discrete state, 
discrete age matrix models. We found that individuals above all three thresholds 
have higher annual survival than those in poverty, especially for mid-ages to 
about age 80. The advantage is greatest when we classify individuals based on 1× 
the "official" poverty threshold. The greatest discrepancy in average remaining 
life expectancy and its variance between those above and in poverty occurs at 
mid-ages for all three thresholds. And fewer individuals are in poverty between 
ages 40-60 for all three thresholds. Our findings are consistent with results 
based on other data sets, but also suggest that dynamic heterogeneity in poverty 
and the transience of the poverty state is associated with income-related 
mortality disparities (less transience, especially of those above poverty, more 
disparities). This paper applies the approach of age-by-stage matrix models to 
human demography and individual poverty dynamics. In so doing we extend the 
literature on individual poverty dynamics across the life course.

BACKGROUND: Uganda changed its antiretroviral therapy guidelines in 2014, 
increasing the CD4 threshold for antiretroviral therapy initiation from 350 
cells/μl to 500 cells/μl. We investigate what effect this change in policy is 
likely to have on HIV incidence, morbidity, and programme costs, and estimate 
the cost-effectiveness of the change over different time horizons.
METHODS: We used a complex individual-based model of HIV transmission and 
antiretroviral therapy scale-up in Uganda. 100 model fits were generated by 
fitting the model to 51 demographic, sexual behaviour, and epidemiological 
calibration targets, varying 96 input parameters, using history matching with 
model emulation. An additional 19 cost and disability weight parameters were 
varied during the analysis of the model results. For each model fit, the model 
was run to 2030, with and without the change in threshold to 500 cells/μl.
RESULTS: The change in threshold led to a 9.7% (90% plausible range: 4.3%-15.0%) 
reduction in incidence in 2030, and averted 278,944 (118,452-502,790) DALYs, at 
a total cost of $28M (-$142M to +$195M). The cost per disability adjusted life 
year (DALY) averted fell over time, from $3238 (-$125 to +$29,969) in 2014 to 
$100 (-$499 to +$785) in 2030. The change in threshold was cost-effective (cost 
<3×Uganda's per capita GDP per DALY averted) by 2018, and highly cost-effective 
(cost <Uganda's per capita GDP per DALY averted) by 2022, for more than 50% of 
parameter sets.
CONCLUSIONS: Model results suggest that the change in threshold is unlikely to 
have been cost-effective to date, but is likely to be highly cost-effective in 
Uganda by 2030. The time horizon needs to be chosen carefully when projecting 
intervention effects. Large amounts of uncertainty in our results demonstrates 
the need to comprehensively incorporate uncertainties in model parameterisation.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. With the increase in 
life expectancy, the number of cancer cases has reached unprecedented levels. In 
this scenario, the pharmaceutical industry has made significant investments in 
this therapeutic area. Despite these efforts, cancer drug research remains a 
remarkably challenging field, and therapeutic innovations have not yet achieved 
expected clinical results. However, the physiopathology of the disease is now 
better understood, and the discovery of novel molecular targets has refreshed 
the expectations of developing improved treatments. Several noteworthy advances 
have been made, among which the development of targeted therapies is the most 
significant. Monoclonal antibodies and antibody-small molecule conjugates have 
emerged as a worthwhile approach to improve drug selectivity and reduce adverse 
effects, which are the main challenges in cancer drug discovery. This review 
will examine the current panorama of drug research and development (R&D) with 
emphasis on some of the major advances brought to clinical trials and to the 
market in the past five years. Breakthrough discoveries will be highlighted 
along with the medicinal chemistry strategies used throughout the discovery 
process. In addition, this review will provide perspectives and updates on the 
discovery of novel molecular targets as well as drugs with innovative mechanisms 
of action.

BACKGROUND: Management of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has significantly 
accelerated in the last few years. Currently, second generation direct acting 
antivirals (DAAs) promise clearance of infection in most of patients. Here we 
present the results of the first analysis carried out on data of Lazio clinical 
network for DAAs.
METHODS: The study was designed as a multicenter cohort: a) to assess the 
evolution of treatment during the first 24 months of the activity of the 
Clinical Network; b) to report overall efficacy of treatments; c) to analyze 
potential factors associated with lack of virological response at 12 weeks after 
therapy (SVR12); d) to evaluate the variation of ALT at baseline and 12 weeks 
after therapy in those who achieved SVR12 in comparison to those who did not. 
Analyses of efficacy were carried out with multilevel mixed effect logistic 
regression model. ALT temporal variation was assessed by mixed effect model 
mixed models with random intercept at patient's level and random slope at the 
level of the time; i.e. either before or after therapy.
RESULTS: Between 30 December 2014 and 31 December 2016 5279 patients started a 
DAA treatment; of those, 5127 (in 14 clinical centers) had completed the 12-week 
follow-up. Overall proportion of SVR12 was 93.41% (N = 4780) with no 
heterogeneity between the 14 clinical centers. Interruption as the consequence 
of severe side effect was very low (only 23 patients). Unadjusted analysis 
indicates that proportion of SVR12 significantly changes according to patient's 
baseline characteristics, however after adjusting for potential confounders only 
adherence to current guidelines, stage of liver diseases, gender, transplant and 
HIV status were independently associated with the response to therapy. Analysis 
of ALT temporal variation showed that ALT level normalized in most, but not, all 
patients who achieved SVR12.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the extraordinary efficacy of DAAs outside 
clinical trials. The advantage of DAAs was particularly significant for those 
patients who were previously considered as difficult-to-treat and did not have 
treatment options before DAAs era. Intervention based on network of select 
centers and prioritization of patients according to diseases severity was 
successful. Further studies are needed to establish whether clearance of HCV 
after DAAs therapy can arrest or even revert liver fibrosis in non-cirrhotic 
patients and/or improve life quality and expectancy in those who achieve SVR12 
with cirrhosis.

extend insect lifespan.

University, Guangzhou 510006, China.

Diapause in insects is akin to dauer in Caenorhabditis elegans and hibernation 
in vertebrates. Diapause causes a profound extension of lifespan by low 
metabolic activity. However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms for low 
metabolic activity remain unknown. Here, we showed that low pyruvate levels are 
present in the brains of diapause-destined pupae of the cotton bollworm 
Helicoverpa armigera, and three enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK), 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) 
are closely correlated with pyruvate homeostasis. Notably, Sirt2 can deacetylate 
the three enzymes to increase their activity in vitro. Thus, low Sirt2 
expression in the brains of diapause individuals decreases PK and PEPCK protein 
levels as well as PGAM activity, resulting in low pyruvate levels and low 
tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and eventually inducing diapause initiation by 
low metabolic activity. These findings suggest that pyruvate is a checkpoint for 
development or lifespan extension, and Sirt2 is a negative regulator to extend 
lifespan in insects.

Most randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are relatively short term and, due to 
costs and available resources, have limited opportunity to be re-visited or 
extended. There is no guarantee that effects of treatments remain unchanged 
beyond the study. Here, we illustrate the feasibility, benefits and 
cost-effectiveness of enriching standard trial design with electronic follow up. 
We completed a 5-year electronic follow up of a RCT investigating the impact of 
probiotics on asthma and eczema in children born 2005-2007, with traditional 
fieldwork follow up to two years. Participants and trial outcomes were 
identified and analysed after five years using secure, routine, anonymised, 
person-based electronic health service databanks. At two years, we identified 
93% of participants and compared fieldwork with electronic health records, 
highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. Retention of children from 
lower socio-economic groups was improved, reducing volunteer bias. At 5 years we 
identified a reduced 82% of participants. These data allowed the trial's first 
robust analysis of asthma endpoints. We found no indication that probiotic 
supplementation to pregnant mothers and infants protected against asthma or 
eczema at 5 years. Continued longer-term follow up is technically 
straightforward.

Why are some individuals more prone to gamble than others? Animals often show 
preferences between 2 foraging options with the same mean reward but different 
degrees of variability in the reward, and such risk preferences vary between 
individuals. Previous attempts to explain variation in risk preference have 
focused on energy budgets, but with limited empirical support. Here, we consider 
whether biological ageing, which affects mortality and residual reproductive 
value, predicts risk preference. We studied a cohort of European starlings 
(Sturnus vulgaris) in which we had previously measured developmental erythrocyte 
telomere attrition, an established integrative biomarker of biological ageing. 
We measured the adult birds' preferences when choosing between a fixed amount of 
food and a variable amount with an equal mean. After controlling for change in 
body weight during the experiment (a proxy for energy budget), we found that 
birds that had undergone greater developmental telomere attrition were more risk 
averse as adults than were those whose telomeres had shortened less as 
nestlings. Developmental telomere attrition was a better predictor of adult risk 
preference than either juvenile telomere length or early-life food supply and 
begging effort. Our longitudinal study thus demonstrates that biological ageing, 
as measured via developmental telomere attrition, is an important source of 
lasting differences in adult risk preferences.

Although the life expectancy of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 
has improved since the introduction of insulin therapy, the acute 
life-threatening and long-term complications from diabetes mellitus are 
significant causes of both mortality and morbidity. Percutaneous intra-portal 
pancreatic islet transplantation (PIPIT) is a minimally invasive, repeatable 
procedure which allows a β-cell replacement therapy through a liver islet 
engraftment, leading to insulin release and glycaemic control restoration in 
patients with diabetes. Allo-PIPIT, in which isolated and purified islets from 
cadaveric donor are used, does not require major surgery, and is potentially 
less expensive for the recipient. In case of long-term T1DM, islet-after-kidney 
(IAK) transplantation can simultaneously cure diabetes and chronic renal 
failure, while islet-transplant-alone (ITA) is performed in brittle, short-term 
T1DM, based on the infusion of an adequate islet mass and on a steroid-free 
immunosuppressive regimen according to the Edmonton protocol. Results of the 
Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR) demonstrate that allo-PIPIT 
reduces episodes of hypoglycemia and diabetic complications, and improves 
quality of life of diabetic patients. Auto-PIPIT, in which the own patient's 
islets are used, has been investigated as a preventive treatment for 
pancreatogenic diabetes in patients who undergo extensive pancreatectomy for 
malignant and non-malignant disease. This Review outlines the role of imaging 
and interventional radiology in allo- and auto-PIPIT.

Survival has improved among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 
with the addition of anti-CD20 antibody therapy. We aimed to quantify trends and 
remaining loss in expectation of life (LEL) due to DLBCL at a national 
population-based level. Patients diagnosed with DLBCL 2000-2013 (N = 7114) were 
identified through the Swedish Lymphoma Registry and classified according to the 
age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI). The novel measure LEL is 
the difference between remaining life years among patients and the general 
population and was predicted using flexible parametric models from diagnosis and 
among 2-year survivors, by age and sex. Median age at DLBCL-diagnosis was 70 
(18-105) years and 54.8% presented with stage III-IV disease. On average, LEL 
due to DLBCL decreased from 8.0 (95% CI: 7.7-8.3) to 4.6 (95% CI: 4.5-4.6) years 
over the study period. By risk group, LEL was most reduced among patients with 
aaIPI ≥2 aged 50-60 years. However, these patients were still estimated to lose 
>8 years in 2013 (eg, LELmales50years 8.6 years (95% CI: 5.0-12.3)). Among 
2-year survivors, LEL was reduced from 6.1 years (95% CI: 5.6-6.5) (aaIPI ≥ 2) 
and 3.8 years (95% CI: 3.6-4.1) (aaIPI < 2) to 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1-1.2) and 1.0 
year (95% CI: 0.8-1.1), respectively. The reduction was observed across all 
ages. Results for females were similar. By using LEL we illustrate the 
improvement of DLBCL survival over time. Despite adequate immunochemotherapy, 
substantial LEL among patients with IPI ≥ 2 points to remaining unmet medical 
needs. We speculate that observed reduced losses among 2-year survivors indicate 
a reduction of late relapses.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated condition which primarily 
affects the joints, but with critical extra-articular manifestations, including 
a significantly increased cardiovascular risk. Patients suffering from RA can 
develop deforming and disabling alterations of the affected joints. Their 
quality of life can be substantially affected, and their life expectancy is 
shorter compared to that of healthy subjects. Fortunately, several pathogenic 
mechanisms characterizing RA have been identified, leading to the development of 
targeted drugs. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were the first 
developed among biological medications and they dramatically changed the 
therapeutic perspectives of RA patients. Now, 20 years after the licensing of 
etanercept (the first anti-TNF drug), more than 10 different biological agents 
have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, 
more and more drugs are under investigation in clinical trials. This review will 
focus on the more recently approved monoclonal antibodies and the more promising 
antibodies under investigation.

OBJECTIVE: Improving medication adherence among children with B-cell precursor 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has the potential to reduce relapse rates 
but requires an investment in resources. An economic evaluation is needed to 
understand the potential costs and benefits of delivering adherence-promotion 
interventions (APIs) as part of standard clinical care.
METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to simulate the potential 
incremental cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to be 
gained from an API for children with B-ALL in first continuous remission 
compared with treatment as usual (TAU, no intervention). Model parameter 
estimates were informed by previously published studies. The primary outcome was 
incremental cost (2015 US$) per QALY gained for API compared with TAU.
RESULTS: The model predicts the API to result in superior health outcomes (4.87 
vs. 4.86 QALYs) and cost savings ($43,540.73 vs. $46,675.71) as compared with 
TAU, and simulations indicate that, across a range of plausible parameter 
estimates, there is a 95% chance that the API is more effective and less costly 
than TAU. The API was estimated to remain more effective and less costly than 
TAU in situations where the prevalence of nonadherence exceeds 32% and when API 
improves baseline adherence in at least 3% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Providing APIs to children with B-ALL may improve health outcomes 
and save costs over a 6-year period.

The cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept for the 
treatment of age-related macular degeneration-A cost-effectiveness analysis from 
a societal perspective.

BACKGROUND: The discussion on the use of bevacizumab is still ongoing and often 
doctors are deterred from using bevacizumab due to legal or political issues. 
Bevacizumab is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), albeit unregistered for the 
disease. Therefore, in some countries ophthalmologists use the equally effective 
but expensive drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept. We describe the economic 
consequences of this dilemma surrounding AMD treatment from a societal 
perspective.
METHODS: We modelled cost-effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab 
(as-needed), aflibercept (bimonthly) and bevacizumab (as-needed). Effectiveness 
was estimated by systematic review and meta-analysis. The drug with the most 
favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared to bevacizumab was used for 
threshold analyses. First, we determined how much we overspend per injection. 
Second, we calculated the required effectiveness to justify the current price 
and the reasonable price for a drug leading to optimal vision. Finally, we 
estimated how much Europe overspends if bevacizumab is not first choice.
RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment costs €27,087 per year, about €4,000 less than 
aflibercept and €6,000 less than ranibizumab. With similar effectiveness for all 
drugs as shown by meta-analysis, bevacizumab was the most cost-effective. 
Aflibercept was chosen for threshold analyses. Aflibercept costs €943 per 
injection, but we determined that the maximum price to be cost-effective is 
€533. Alternatively, at its current price, aflibercept should yield about twice 
the visual gain. Even when optimal vision can be achieved, the maximum price for 
any treatment is €37,453 per year. Most importantly, Europe overspends €335 
million yearly on AMD treatment when choosing aflibercept over bevacizumab.
CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab is the most cost-effective treatment for AMD, yet is not 
the standard of care across Europe. The registered drugs ranibizumab and 
aflibercept lead to large overspending without additional health benefits. 
Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into 
clinical practice as first choice.
