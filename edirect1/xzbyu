OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of early lens extraction with 
intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of primary angle closure 
glaucoma (PACG) compared to standard care.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a multicentre pragmatic two-arm 
randomised controlled trial. Patients were followed-up for 36 months, and data 
on health service usage and health state utility were collected and analysed 
within the trial time horizon. A Markov model was developed to extrapolate the 
results over a 5-year and 10-year time horizon.
SETTING: 22 hospital eye services in the UK.
POPULATION: Males and females aged 50 years or over with newly diagnosed PACG or 
primary angle closure (PAC).
INTERVENTIONS: Lens extraction compared to standard care (ie, laser iridotomy 
followed by medical therapy and glaucoma surgery).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of primary and secondary healthcare usage (UK NHS 
perspective), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for lens extraction versus standard care.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 67.5 (8.42), 57.5% were women, 44.6% 
had both eyes eligible, 1.4% were of Asian ethnicity and 35.4% had PAC. The mean 
health service costs were higher in patients randomised to lens extraction: 
£2467 vs £1486. The mean adjusted QALYs were also higher with early lens 
extraction: 2.602 vs 2.533. The ICER for lens extraction versus standard care 
was £14 284 per QALY gained at three years. Modelling suggests that the ICER may 
drop to £7090 per QALY gained by 5 years and that lens extraction may be cost 
saving by 10 years. Our results are generally robust to changes in the key input 
parameters and assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that lens extraction has a 67-89% chance of being 
cost-effective at 3 years and that it may be cost saving by 10 years.

Cost-effectiveness of superficial femoral artery endovascular interventions in 
the UK and Germany: a modelling study.

Author information:

(2)Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the lifetime costs and cost-effectiveness of 5 
endovascular interventions to treat superficial femoral arterial disease.
DESIGN: A model-based health economic evaluation. An existing decision 
analytical model was used, with updated effectiveness data taken from the 
literature, and updated costs based on purchasing prices.
SETTING: UK and German healthcare perspectives were considered.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with intermittent claudication of the femoropopliteal 
arteries eligible for endovascular treatment.
METHODS: UK and German healthcare perspectives were considered, as were 
different strategies for re-intervention.
INTERVENTIONS: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with bail-out bare 
metal stenting (assumed to represent the existing standard of care, and 4 
alternatives: primary bare metal stents, drug-eluting stents, drug-eluting 
balloons (DEBs) and biomimetic stents).
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between 2 
treatments, defined as the incremental costs divided by the incremental 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Use of a biomimetic stent, BioMimics 3D, was always estimated to 
dominate the other interventions, having lower lifetime costs and greater 
effectiveness, as measured by QALYs. Of the remaining interventions, DEBs were 
always the most effective, and PTA the least effective. There was uncertainty in 
the cost-effectiveness results, with key drivers being the costs and 
effectiveness of the biomimetic stent along with the costs of DEBs.
CONCLUSIONS: All 4 of the alternatives to PTA were more effective, with the 
biomimetic stent being the most cost-effective. As there was uncertainty in the 
results, and all of the interventions have different mechanisms of action, all 4 
may be considered to be alternatives to PTA.

BACKGROUND: Evolutionary theory predicts that antagonistically selected alleles, 
such as those with divergent pleiotropic effects in early and late life, may 
often reach intermediate population frequencies due to balancing selection, an 
elusive process when sought out empirically. Alternatively, genetic diversity 
may increase as a result of positive frequency-dependent selection and genetic 
purging in bottlenecked populations.
RESULTS: While experimental evolution systems with directional phenotypic 
selection typically result in at least local heterozygosity loss, we report that 
selection for increased lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster leads to an 
extensive genome-wide increase of nucleotide diversity in the selected lines 
compared to replicate control lines, pronounced in regions with no or low 
recombination, such as chromosome 4 and centromere neighborhoods. These changes, 
particularly in coding sequences, are most consistent with the operation of 
balancing selection and the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging and life 
history traits that tend to be intercorrelated. Genes involved in antioxidant 
defenses, along with multiple lncRNAs, were among those most affected by 
balancing selection. Despite the overwhelming genetic diversification and the 
paucity of selective sweep regions, two genes with functions important for 
central nervous system and memory, Ptp10D and Ank2, evolved under positive 
selection in the longevity lines.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the 'evolve-and-resequence' experimental approach proves 
successful in providing unique insights into the complex evolutionary dynamics 
of genomic regions responsible for longevity.

BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms. Our group has 
treated more than 2,000 NET patients and has performed more than 1,000 surgical 
cytoreductive procedures.
STUDY DESIGN: Records of 834 NET patients who underwent surgical cytoreduction 
at our institution were reviewed. Demographic information, intraoperative 
findings, extent of disease, complications, and survival rates were calculated.
RESULTS: Eight hundred patients underwent 1,001 cytoreductive operations. 
Sixty-five percent had small bowel primaries. One hundred and thirty-eight 
patients presented with an unknown primary site, which was localized 
intraoperatively in 89% of these cases. The intraoperative complication rate was 
9%. The incidence of intraoperative carcinoid crisis was 1%. Mean ± SD operative 
time was 368 ± 146 minutes. Mean ± SD hospital stay was 9 ± 10 days. Minor 
postoperative complications occurred after 43% of procedures and major 
postoperative complications were noted after 19% of procedures. The 30-day 
postoperative mortality rate was 2%. Median overall survival (OS) for patients 
with pancreatic NETs was 124 months. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year OS rates for 
patients with pancreatic NETs were 67%, 51%, and 36%, respectively. The life 
expectancy difference (between OS and actuarial survival) after surgical 
cytoreduction for patients with pancreatic NETs was 16.6 years. Median OS for 
patients with small bowel NETs was 161 months. The 5-, 10-, and 20-year OS rates 
for patients with small bowel NETs were 84%, 67% and 31%, respectively. The life 
expectancy difference after surgical cytoreduction for patients with small bowel 
NETs was 11.7 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical cytoreduction in NET patients has low morbidity and 
mortality rates and results in prolonged survival. We believe that surgical 
cytoreduction should play a major role in the care of patients with NETs.

BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of early adjuvant 
versus salvage radiation therapy after prostatectomy for prostate cancer. 
Estimates of prostate cancer progression from the Decipher genomic classifier 
(GC) could guide informed decision-making and improve the outcomes for patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with GC-based treatment decisions 
regarding adjuvant therapy after prostatectomy with those of 2 control 
strategies: usual care (determined from patterns of care studies) and the 
alternative of 100% adjuvant radiation therapy. Using the bootstrapping method 
of sampling with replacement, the cases of 10,000 patients were simulated during 
a 10-year time horizon, with each subject having individual estimates for cancer 
progression (according to GC findings) and noncancer mortality (according to 
age).
RESULTS: GC-based care was more effective and less costly than 100% adjuvant 
radiation therapy and resulted in cost savings up to an assay cost of $11,402. 
Compared with usual care, GC-based care resulted in more QALYs. Assuming a $4000 
assay cost, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $90,833 per QALY, 
assuming a 7% usage rate of adjuvant radiation therapy. GC-based care was also 
associated with a 16% reduction in the percentage of patients with distant 
metastasis at 5 years compared with usual care.
CONCLUSION: The Decipher GC could be a cost-effective approach for 
genomics-driven cancer treatment decisions after prostatectomy, with 
improvements in estimated clinical outcomes compared with usual care. The 
individualized decision analytic framework applied in the present study offers a 
flexible approach to estimate the potential utility of genomic assays for 
personalized cancer medicine.

OBJECTIVE: Sparing the hypothalamus after craniopharyngioma treatment is a 
prerequisite to ensure a good quality of life. In this study, the functional 
prognosis of craniopharyngioma after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery 
(EES) was examined in function of the degree of hypothalamic extension.
METHODS: Twenty cases of craniopharyngioma treated by EES were categorized 
according to the Puget classification using preoperative and postoperative 
magnetic resonance imaging. The degree of resection rates, amelioration of 
symptoms, and endocrinologic and hypothalamic functions were evaluated during 
the postoperative follow-up period.
RESULTS: All cases were preoperatively classified into grades 0 (n = 8), 1 (n = 
7), and 2 (n = 5). Near total resection was achieved in half of the cases. 
Moreover, visual improvement was observed in 75% of the cases. The incidence 
rate of additional endocrinologic dysfunction was not related to the 
preoperative grade or intraoperative stalk preservation. Postoperative magnetic 
resonance imaging indicated hypothalamic preservation for all grades. After an 
average of 60 months follow-up of 11 patients with primary tumors, 4 patients 
showed tumor regrowth controlled by stereotactic radiation therapy. All patients 
recorded more than 80% on the Karnofsky Performance Scale and showed no 
additional obesity at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: EES provides optimal resection rate and limited complications 
because of the preservation of the hypothalamus, regardless of the degree of 
preoperative hypothalamic involvement. Consequently, the rate of obesity 
occurrence is also decreased. This study indicates that EES protects 
hypothalamus function and improves tumor removal rate, and that it will become 
the first choice of surgical procedure for managing craniopharyngiomas.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical chronic multiorgan 
autoimmune disorder that can lead to significant burden of disease and loss of 
life expectancy. The disease burden is the result of a complex interplay between 
genetic, biologic, socioeconomic, and health system variables affecting the 
individual. Recent advances in biological understanding of SLE are yet to 
translate to transformative therapies, and genetic and socioeconomic variables 
are not readily amenable to intervention. In contrast, healthcare quality, a 
variable readily amenable to change, has been inadequately addressed in SLE, 
despite evidence in other chronic diseases that quality of care is strongly 
associated with patient outcomes. This article will analyze the available 
literature on the quality of care relevant to SLE, identify knowledge gaps, and 
suggest ways to address this in future research.

Early Identification of Autism: Early Characteristics, Onset of Symptoms, and 
Diagnostic Stability.

Webb SJ(1), Jones EJ(1).

Autism Center, University of Washington, Seattle.

In the first year of life, infants who later go on to develop autistic spectrum 
disorders (ASD) may exhibit subtle disruptions in social interest and attention, 
communication, temperament, and head circumference growth that occur prior to 
the onset of clinical symptoms. These disruptions may reflect the early course 
of ASD development and may also contribute to the later development of clinical 
symptoms through alterations in the child's experience of his or her 
environment. By age 2, developmental precursors of autism symptoms can be used 
to diagnose children reliably, and by age 3, the diagnosis is thought to be 
relatively stable. The downward extension of the autism diagnosis poses 
important questions for therapists in designing interventions that are 
applicable for infants who demonstrate early risk factors. We review current 
knowledge of the early signs of ASD in the infancy period (0-12 months) and the 
manifestation of symptoms in toddlerhood (12- 36 months), noting the importance 
of considering the variability in onset and trajectory of ASD. Finally, we 
consider the implications of this emerging research for those who work or 
interact with young children, including the importance of early monitoring and 
the development and evaluation of age-appropriate interventions.

The objective of this study is to examine longevity disparities in Hawai'i by 
race/ethnicity and gender based on age-specific death rates in 2010. Abridged 
life tables for Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Hawaiians, and Caucasians in 
Hawai'i are presented for the age groups: <1, 1-4, every 5-year interval from 
5-84, and 85+ years for the year of 2010. Death data were provided by the 
Hawai'i Department of Health Office of Health Status Monitoring, and population 
data were based on 2010 Census modified based on ethnicity estimates from the 
Hawai'i Health Survey. Life expectancy at birth in Hawai'i has increased 
consistently from 69.5 years in 1950 to 82.4 years in 2010. Longevity 
disparities seen in past decades continue to persist between the longest-living 
groups, Japanese and Chinese, and the shortest-living group, Native Hawaiians, 
with a gap of approximately 10 years. In addition, females lived 6 years longer 
than males on average. Racial/ethnic disparities in longevity can be partially 
explained by differences in socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health care 
access, and racism. Native Hawaiians continue to have the shortest life 
expectancy of the ethnic groups examined, requiring expanded efforts to address 
Native Hawaiian health across the life course. Our findings also support more 
ethnic-specific research to understand the health care needs and utilization 
patterns of each group.

This article was designed to report the experience with the provision of early 
rehabilitation care to the children suffering from a spinal-cord injury (SCI) 
that was gained at the Clinical and Research Institute of Urgent Pediatric 
Surgery and Traumatology. The authors have developed and describe the combined 
multidisciplinary approach making it possible to promote the recovery of the 
children presenting with SCI at the first stage of the rehabilitative treatment. 
They distinguish three basic periods in the early rehabilitation of the children 
with this condition, defined the main goals of rehabilitation and the role of 
each specialist in their achievement. The results of the work provided the basis 
for the development of a stepwise approach for the extension of the 
rehabilitation measures and the solution of the tasks facing rehabilitation of 
the patients with vertebral cerebrospinal injuries. The correction of nutritive 
losses was found to be a most important component of the early stage of the 
rehabilitation process preceding the full-scale rehabilitative treatment. The 
role of various technical devices designed for the patients' re-education in 
functional motor activities, development and acquisition of the sustained 
self-service skills, enhancement of the patient's mobility, and improvement of 
his/her quality of life is discussed. The importance of the early beginning of 
the rehabilitation measures for the children suffering from a vertebral 
cerebrospinal injury has been confirmed.

Purpose To provide recommendations for the management options for patients with 
small renal masses (SRMs). Methods By using a literature search and 
prospectively defined study selection, we sought systematic reviews, 
meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, prospective comparative observational 
studies, and retrospective studies published from 2000 through 2015. Outcomes 
included recurrence-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall 
survival. Results Eighty-three studies, including 20 systematic reviews and 63 
primary studies, met the eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for 
the guideline recommendations. Recommendations On the basis of tumor-specific 
findings and competing risks of mortality, all patients with an SRM should be 
considered for a biopsy when the results may alter management. Active 
surveillance should be an initial management option for patients who have 
significant comorbidities and limited life expectancy. Partial nephrectomy (PN) 
for SRMs is the standard treatment that should be offered to all patients for 
whom an intervention is indicated and who possess a tumor that is amenable to 
this approach. Percutaneous thermal ablation should be considered an option if 
complete ablation can reliably be achieved. Radical nephrectomy for SRMs should 
only be reserved for patients who possess a tumor of significant complexity that 
is not amenable to PN or for whom PN may result in unacceptable morbidity even 
when performed at centers with expertise. Referral to a nephrologist should be 
considered if chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 
mL/min/1.73 m2) or progressive chronic kidney disease occurs after treatment, 
especially if associated with proteinuria.

Purpose The general outlook for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) in first remission is important information for patients and for 
planning post-treatment follow-up. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
survival of patients with DLBCL in remission compared with a matched general 
population. Methods A total of 1,621 patients from the Danish Lymphoma Registry 
who were newly diagnosed with DLBCL between 2003 and 2011 were included in this 
study. All patients were ≥ 16 years of age at diagnosis and had achieved 
complete remission or complete remission unconfirmed after first-line rituximab 
plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) or 
R-CHOP-like therapy. Results The 5-year post-treatment DLBCL survival was 
inferior to survival in the matched general population (78%; 95% CI, 76 to 80; v 
87%; standardized mortality ratio, 1.75; P < .001). Excess mortality was present 
but reduced for patients achieving post-treatment event-free survival for 24 
months (pEFS24; standardized mortality ratio, 1.27; P < .001). In age-stratified 
analyses, the survival of patients < 50 years of age was normalized to the 
general population after achieving pEFS24 ( P = .99). During the first 8 years 
after pEFS24, the average loss of lifetime was 0.31 mo/y (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.50 
mo/y). Excess mortality diminished when analyzing death from lymphoma as 
competing event to death from other causes, suggesting that early and late 
relapse is responsible for increased mortality in patients with DLBCL. 
Conclusion Although this population-based study does not support complete 
normalization of survival for patients with DLBCL achieving pEFS24, the 
estimated loss of residual lifetime was low for patients in continuous remission 
2 years after ending treatment. Therefore, pEFS24 is an appealing and relevant 
milestone for patient counseling and could be a surrogate end point in clinical 
trials.

The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) is witnessing an increase in chronic 
disorders, including mental illness. With ongoing unrest, this is expected to 
rise. This is the first study to quantify the burden of mental disorders in the 
EMR. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 2013. DALYs 
(disability-adjusted life years) allow assessment of both premature mortality 
(years of life lost-YLLs) and nonfatal outcomes (years lived with 
disability-YLDs). DALYs are computed by adding YLLs and YLDs for each 
age-sex-country group. In 2013, mental disorders contributed to 5.6% of the 
total disease burden in the EMR (1894 DALYS/100,000 population): 2519 
DALYS/100,000 (2590/100,000 males, 2426/100,000 females) in high-income 
countries, 1884 DALYS/100,000 (1618/100,000 males, 2157/100,000 females) in 
middle-income countries, 1607 DALYS/100,000 (1500/100,000 males, 1717/100,000 
females) in low-income countries. Females had a greater proportion of burden due 
to mental disorders than did males of equivalent ages, except for those under 15 
years of age. The highest proportion of DALYs occurred in the 25-49 age group, 
with a peak in the 35-39 years age group (5344 DALYs/100,000). The burden of 
mental disorders in EMR increased from 1726 DALYs/100,000 in 1990 to 1912 
DALYs/100,000 in 2013 (10.8% increase). Within the mental disorders group in 
EMR, depressive disorders accounted for most DALYs, followed by anxiety 
disorders. Among EMR countries, Palestine had the largest burden of mental 
disorders. Nearly all EMR countries had a higher mental disorder burden compared 
to the global level. Our findings call for EMR ministries of health to increase 
provision of mental health services and to address the stigma of mental illness. 
Moreover, our results showing the accelerating burden of mental health are 
alarming as the region is seeing an increased level of instability. Indeed, 
mental health problems, if not properly addressed, will lead to an increased 
burden of diseases in the region.

BACKGROUND: Net survival is the most common measure of cancer prognosis and has 
been used to study differentials in cancer survival between ethnic or racial 
population subgroups. However, net survival ignores competing risks of deaths 
and so provides incomplete prognostic information for cancer patients, and when 
comparing survival between populations with different all-cause mortality. 
Another prognosis measure, "crude probability of death", which takes competing 
risk of death into account, overcomes this limitation. Similar to net survival, 
it can be calculated using either life tables (using Cronin-Feuer method) or 
cause of death data (using Fine-Gray method). The aim of this study is two-fold: 
(1) to compare the multivariable results produced by different survival analysis 
methods; and (2) to compare the Cronin-Feuer with the Fine-Gray methods, in 
estimating the cancer and non-cancer death probability of both Indigenous and 
non-Indigenous cancer patients and the Indigenous cancer disparities.
METHODS: Cancer survival was investigated for 9,595 people (18.5% Indigenous) 
diagnosed with cancer in the Northern Territory of Australia between 1991 and 
2009. The Cox proportional hazard model along with Poisson and Fine-Gray 
regression were used in the multivariable analysis. The crude probabilities of 
cancer and non-cancer methods were estimated in two ways: first, using cause of 
death data with the Fine-Gray method, and second, using life tables with the 
Cronin-Feuer method.
RESULTS: Multivariable regression using the relative survival, cause-specific 
survival, and competing risk analysis produced similar results. In the presence 
of competing risks, the Cronin-Feuer method produced similar results to 
Fine-Gray in the estimation of cancer death probability (higher Indigenous 
cancer death probabilities for all cancers) and non-cancer death probabilities 
(higher Indigenous non-cancer death probabilities for all cancers except lung 
cancer and head and neck cancers). Cronin-Feuer estimated much lower non-cancer 
death probabilities than Fine-Gray for non-Indigenous patients with head and 
neck cancers and lung cancers (both smoking-related cancers).
CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of the Cronin-Feuer method, it is a 
reasonable alternative to the Fine-Gray method for assessing the Indigenous 
survival differential in the presence of competing risks when valid and reliable 
subgroup-specific life tables are available and cause of death data are 
unavailable or unreliable.

BACKGROUND: While Chuna manual therapy is a Korean manual therapy widely used 
primarily for low back pain (LBP)-related disorders in Korea, well-designed 
studies on the comparative effectiveness of Chuna manual therapy are scarce.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is the protocol for a three-armed, multicenter, 
pragmatic randomized controlled pilot trial. Sixty severe nonacute LBP patients 
(pain duration of at least 3 weeks, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ≥5) will be 
recruited at four Korean medicine hospitals. Participants will be randomly 
allocated to the Chuna group (n = 20), usual care group (n = 20), or Chuna plus 
usual care group (n = 20) for 6 weeks of treatment. Usual care will consist of 
orally administered conventional medicine, physical therapy, and back pain care 
education. The trial will be conducted with outcome assessor and statistician 
blinding. The primary endpoint will be NRS of LBP at week 7 post randomization. 
Secondary outcomes include NRS of leg pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), 
the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), the Credibility and Expectancy 
Questionnaire, lumbar range of motion (ROM), the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) 
health survey, the Health Utility Index III (HUI-III), and economic evaluation 
and safety data. Post-treatment follow-ups will be conducted at 1, 4, and 
10 weeks after conclusion of treatment.
DISCUSSION: This study will assess the comparative effectiveness of Chuna manual 
therapy compared to conventional usual care. Costs and effectiveness (utility) 
data will be analyzed for exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis. If this pilot 
study does not reach a definite conclusion due to its small sample size, these 
results will be used as preliminary results to calculate sample size for future 
large-scale clinical trials and contribute in the assessment of feasibility of a 
full-scale multicenter trial.

BACKGROUND: Limiting treatment forms part of practice in many fields of 
medicine. There is a scarcity of robust data from Germany. Therefore, in this 
paper, we report results of a survey among German physicians with a focus on 
frequencies, aspects of decision making and determinants of limiting treatment 
with expected or intended shortening of life.
METHODS: Postal survey among a random sample of physicians working in the area 
of five German state chambers of physicians using a modified version of the 
questionnaire of the EURELD Consortium. Information requested referred to the 
patients who died most recently within the last 12 months. Logistic regression 
was performed to analyse associations between characteristics of physicians and 
patients regarding limitation of treatment with expected or intended shortening 
of life.
RESULTS: As reported elsewhere, 734 physicians responded (response rate 36.9%) 
and of these, 174 (43.2%) reported a withholding and 144 (35.7%) a withdrawal of 
treatment. Eighty one physicians estimated that there was at least some 
shortening of life as a consequence. In 25.9% of these cases hastening death had 
been discussed with the patient at the time or immediately prior to this action. 
Types of treatment most frequently limited was artificial nutrition (n = 35). 
Bivariate analysis indicates that limitation of treatment with possible or 
intended shortening of life for patients aged > 75 years is performed 
significantly more often (p = 0.007, OR 1.848). There was significantly less 
limitation of treatment in patients who died from cancer compared to patients
