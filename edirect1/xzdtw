Obesity, a growing chronic metabolic disease, greatly increases the risk of 
metabolic syndrome which includes type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and 
cardiovascular diseases. Obesity-associated metabolic diseases significantly 
contribute to mortality and reduce life expectancy. Recently, innate lymphoid 
cells (ILCs) have emerged as crucial regulators of metabolic homeostasis and 
tissue inflammation. This review focuses on the roles of ILCs in different 
metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue, liver, pancreas, and intestine. We 
briefly outline the relationship between obesity, inflammation, and insulin 
resistance. We then discuss how ILCs in distinct metabolic organs may function 
to maintain metabolic homeostasis and contribute to obesity and its associated 
metabolic diseases. The potential of ILCs as the therapeutic target for obesity 
and insulin resistance is also addressed.

DNA methylation is defined as a conserved epigenetic modification mechanism that 
plays a key role in maintaining normal gene expression without altering the DNA 
sequence. Several studies have reported that altered methylation patterns were 
associated with male sterility in some plants such as rice and wheat, but global 
methylation profiles and their possible roles in cytoplasmic male sterility 
(CMS), especially in cotton near-isogenic lines, remain unclear. In this study, 
bisulfite sequencing technology and RNA-Seq were used to investigate CMS line 
07-113A and its near-isogenic line 07-113B. Using integrated methylome and 
transcriptome analyses, we found that the number of hypermethylated genes in the 
differentially methylated regions, whether in the promoter region or in the gene 
region, was more in 07-113A than the number in 07-113B. The data indicated that 
07-113A was more susceptible to methylation. In order to further analyze the 
regulatory network of male sterility, transcriptome sequencing and DNA 
methylation group data were used to compare the characteristics of near-isogenic 
lines 07-113A and 07-113B in cotton during the abortion stage. Combined 
methylation and transcriptome analysis showed that differentially expressed 
methylated genes were mainly concentrated in vital metabolic pathways including 
the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways and galactose metabolism. And there 
was a negative correlation between gene methylation and gene expression. In 
addition, five key genes that may be associated with CMS in cotton were 
identified. These data will support further understanding of the effect of DNA 
methylation on gene expression and their potential roles in cotton CMS.

management.

The treatment landscape of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
has dramatically changed over the past 10 years, particularly thanks to the 
advent and development of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting 
oncogenic drivers. Among them, patients bearing anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
translocations, which are causative of 3-5% of all advanced NSCLC, have seen 
dramatically improved their clinical outcomes moving life expectancy at 5 years 
from less than 5% to 50%. In fact, multiple ALK inhibitors (ALKi) entered in the 
therapeutic algorithm of ALK+ patients, multiplying their treatment 
opportunities. Remarkably, in the near future we could take advantage of up to 
different 6 molecules for the first-line approach (crizotinib, ceritinib, 
alectinib, brigatinib, plus ensartinib and lorlatinib). Among available ALKi, 
brigatinib, a second-generation (2G) inhibitor, showed notable activity in this 
setting, also against central nervous system (CNS) disease, and a good safety 
profile, supporting its approval as upfront treatment based on the ALTA-1L trial 
results. With a peculiar profile of enzymatic targets, brigatinib represents a 
valuable opportunity in the ALK targeting journey, albeit having to balance its 
safety profile. The abundance of therapeutic options for these patients poses 
nontrivial questions; in absence of direct comparisons of efficacy is not easy 
to define the best approach and, more compelling, the correct administration 
sequence in order to give the best therapeutic chances to ALK+ lung cancer 
patients. In such wide variety of options, we reviewed the preclinical and 
clinical efficacy data of brigatinib, its pharmacological and safety profile, 
like also actual and potential future applications in the ALK+ NSCLC scenario. 
Through a spurious exercise of an indirect comparison with other available 2G 
ALKi, we tent to summarize the required knowledge to properly choose the best 
drug at the right time. Furthermore, we reviewed available data on molecular 
resistance mechanisms and putative therapeutic applications in other contexts, 
such as ROS1+ NSCLC patients or EGFR+ ones progressing to osimertinib.

AIM: JointRep is a bioadhesive hydrogel arthroscopically injected to facilitate 
cartilage regeneration. The cost-effectiveness of JointRep with microfracture 
surgery compared to microfracture alone was evaluated from the Australian 
healthcare system perspective, in patients with symptomatic focal chondral 
defects (Outerbridge Grade 3 or 4) of the knee who had failed conservative 
treatment and were indicated for surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A de novo Markov model comprising two health states- 
'Alive' and 'Dead' was developed. Model transition probability was based on the 
general population mortality rates. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the 
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, a 
validated patient-reported tool measuring pain, stiffness, and physical 
function. The utility was derived by mapping WOMAC scores to EQ-5D scores using 
a published algorithm. Cost inputs were based on published Australian costs from 
AR-DRGs, Medicare Benefits Schedule, and Prostheses List. Model outcomes 
included costs, Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Base-case analysis was conducted for a time 
horizon of 3 years and a cycle length of 1 year. Cost and health outcomes were 
discounted at 5% per annum. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were also 
conducted.
RESULTS: Total QALYs were estimated to be higher for JointRep with microfracture 
surgery (2.61) compared to microfracture surgery alone (1.66), an incremental 
gain of 0.95 QALY. JointRep with microfracture surgery was associated with an 
incremental cost of $6,022 compared to microfracture surgery alone, thus leading 
to an ICER of $6,328. Results were substantially robust to varying parameters in 
the sensitivity analyses conducted, alternative model settings and assumptions 
in scenario analyses.
LIMITATIONS: The clinical inputs used in the model were based on data from short 
duration, non-randomized, post-market clinical trial.
CONCLUSIONS: JointRep with microfracture surgery is a cost-effective treatment 
option compared to microfracture alone from the Australian health care system 
perspective.

306. Pharmacological therapies with cardiovascular and other benefits in people
with  type 2 diabetes: Type 2 diabetes: Evidence review B.

London: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); 2022 Feb.
NICE Evidence Reviews Collection.

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterised by insulin 
resistance (that is, the body’s inability to effectively use insulin) and 
insufficient pancreatic insulin production, resulting in high blood glucose 
levels (hyperglycaemia). Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with obesity, 
physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, disturbed blood lipid levels and a 
tendency to develop thrombosis, and is therefore recognised to have an increased 
cardiovascular risk. Type 2 diabetes has a significant impact on lifestyle, and 
is associated with major long-term complications, reduced quality of life, and 
reduced life expectancy (by an average of 5 to 7 years). There are approximately 
3.9 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK, 90% of adults with 
diabetes have type 2 diabetes, and incidence is increasing. The condition 
accounts for 10% of NHS expenditure with complications of type 2 diabetes 
leading to 5-fold increases in NHS costs and prolonged hospital stays for the 
individual. Since the publication of the NICE guideline on Type 2 Diabetes in 
2015 (NG28) new glucose lowering drugs (sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) 
Inhibitors, Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and Glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists) have been licensed. The cardiovascular impact of 
these drugs has been assessed using a trial design whereby the drug being tested 
is added to a mixed background of treatments and compared to another drug or 
placebo on a similar mixed treatment background. These cardiovascular outcome 
trials (CVOTs) are different in design to trials that compare treatments to each 
other where everyone in a particular arm is on the same treatment and therefore 
cannot be combined with these trials directly for analysis. However, the results 
of these different formats of trials can be combined in an economic model to 
enable an assessment of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the drugs 
taking the newly identified cardiovascular benefits into account. This review 
was carried out to rapidly provide information about the cost-effectiveness of 
the new drugs, incorporating their cardiovascular benefits, and to use these 
results to update the pharmacological treatment pathway. Due to the need for a 
rapid update, the existing evidence base from NG28 has been retained unchanged 
and only the new evidence from the CVOTs has been added. The protocol for this 
review is summarised below and presented in detail in Appendix A. Studies which 
looked at these interventions in relation to renal outcomes have been 
incorporated into a separate review looking at the effectiveness of these drugs 
in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Extracting data from {Zhu, 2019 #5} daily life activities is important in 
biomechanical applications to define exact boundary conditions for the intended 
use-based applications. Although optoelectronic camera-marker based systems are 
used as gold standard tools for medical applications, due to line-of-sight 
problem, there is a need for wearable, affordable motion capture (MOCAP) 
systems. We investigate the potential use of a wearable inertial measurement 
unit (IMU) based-wearable MOCAP system for biomechanical applications. The in 
vitro proof of concept is provided for the full lower body consisting of hip, 
knee, and ankle joints via controlled single-plane anatomical range of motion 
(ROM) simulations using an electrical motor, while collecting data 
simultaneously via opto-electronic markers and IMU sensors. On 15 healthy 
volunteers the flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, internal-external 
rotation (ROM) values of hip and, the flexion - extension ROM values of the knee 
and ankle joints are calculated for both systems. The Bland-Altman graphs showed 
promising agreement both for in vitro and in vivo experiments. The maximum Root 
Mean Square Errors (RMSE) between the systems in vitro was 3.4° for hip and 5.9° 
for knee flexion motion in vivo, respectively. The gait data of the volunteers 
were assessed between the heel strike and toe off events to investigate the 
limits of agreement, calculating the population averages and standard deviation 
for both systems over the gait cycle. The maximum difference was for the ankle 
joint <6°. The results show that proposed system could be an option as an 
affordable-democratic solution.

The Link between Democratic Institutions and Population Health in the American 
States.

(2)Smith College.

CONTEXT: This project investigates the role of state-level institutions in 
explaining variation in population health in the American states. Although 
cross-national research has established the positive effects of democracy on 
population health, little attention has been given to subnational units. The 
authors leverage a new data set to understand how political accountability and a 
system of checks and balances are associated with state population health.
METHODS: The authors estimate error correction models and two-way fixed effects 
models to estimate how the strength of state-level democratic institutions is 
associated with infant mortality rates, life expectancy, and midlife mortality.
FINDINGS: The authors find institutions that promote political accountability 
are associated with lower infant mortality across the states, while those that 
promote checks and balances are associated with longer life expectancy. They 
also find that policy liberalism is associated with better health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Subnational institutions play an important role in population 
health outcomes, and more research is needed to understand the link between 
democracy and health. The authors are the first to explore the link between 
democratic institutions and population health within the United States, 
contributing to both the social science literature on the positive effects of 
democracy and the epidemiological literature on subnational health outcomes.

Apical Support Procedures at the Time of Hysterectomy for Benign Indications: A 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of performing routine concurrent 
apical support procedures at the time of hysterectomy for benign indications.
METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model from the health care sector 
perspective to compare concurrent apical support (ie, McCall culdoplasty) at the 
time of hysterectomy for benign indications compared with hysterectomy alone. We 
modeled Markov transitions between asymptomatic, prolapse without treatment, and 
treated prolapse states for 3 years. Our primary outcome was incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the difference between groups in mean cost 
(2019 U.S. dollars) divided by the difference in mean quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Model parameter estimates were taken from the published 
medical literature. Cost estimates were obtained from Medicare reimbursement 
rates and the literature. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: We assumed a base-case scenario of 13% posthysterectomy prolapse after 
hysterectomy alone and 2.1% after concurrent apical support, 5.8% and 0.9% 
undergoing subsequent surgical treatment for prolapse, respectively. Concurrent 
apical support at the time of hysterectomy had higher costs ($1,667 vs $1,423) 
but was more effective (2.34 vs 2.31 QALYs) than hysterectomy alone. Concurrent 
apical support was cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of $11,988/QALY, compared with general willingness-to-pay ranges of 
$50,000-150,000/QALY. In sensitivity analyses, concurrent apical support 
remained cost effective as long as the rate of posthysterectomy prolapse after 
concurrent apical support remained less than 8.7%. Monte Carlo simulation showed 
that concurrent apical support was cost effective in more than 60% of the 
simulated iterations.
CONCLUSION: Apical support at the time of hysterectomy for benign indications is 
cost effective compared with hysterectomy alone from the health care sector 
perspective at 3 years. Our results suggest that encouraging concurrent apical 
support procedures at time of hysterectomy is a cost-effective strategy in 
preventing posthysterectomy vaginal prolapse.

This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of liver transplantation in patients 
with colorectal liver metastases confined to the liver with progressive disease, 
compared with alternative treatment options: TAS-102, regorafenib, or best 
supportive care. Using a mathematical simulation model, people’s life expectancy 
and healthcare costs over 25 years were estimated. Transplanted patients lived 
for 4.28 years, more than 3 years longer than those who received alternative 
treatment options. Despite this, the high cost of liver transplantation meant 
that this treatment was cost-effective only at high willingness-to-pay 
thresholds.

Exercise and physical activity can improve bone strength and the risk of falls, 
which may offer benefits in the prevention and management of osteoporosis. 
However, uncertainty about the types of exercise that are safe and effective 
instigates lack of confidence in people with osteoporosis and health 
professionals. Existing guidelines leave some questions unresolved. This 
consensus statement aimed to determine the physical activity and exercise needed 
to optimise bone strength, reduce fall and fracture risk, improve posture and 
manage vertebral fracture symptoms, while minimising potential risks in people 
with osteoporosis. The scope of this statement was developed following 
stakeholder consultation. Meta-analyses were reviewed and where evidence was 
lacking, individual studies or expert opinion were used to develop 
recommendations. A multidisciplinary expert group reviewed evidence to make 
recommendations, by consensus when evidence was not available. Key 
recommendations are that people with osteoporosis should undertake (1) 
resistance and impact exercise to maximise bone strength; (2) activities to 
improve strength and balance to reduce falls; (3) spinal extension exercise to 
improve posture and potentially reduce risk of falls and vertebral fractures. 
For safety, we recommend avoiding postures involving a high degree of spinal 
flexion during exercise or daily life. People with vertebral fracture or 
multiple low trauma fractures should usually exercise only up to an impact 
equivalent to brisk walking. Those at risk of falls should start with targeted 
strength and balance training. Vertebral fracture symptoms may benefit from 
exercise to reduce pain, improve mobility and quality of life, ideally with 
specialist advice to encourage return to normal activities. Everyone with 
osteoporosis may benefit from guidance on adapting postures and movements. There 
is little evidence that physical activity is associated with significant harm, 
and the benefits, in general, outweigh the risks.

Physical activity (PA) helps many cancer patients improve health-related 
fitness, treatment-related side effects, quality of life, and possibly survival; 
however, limited research has been conducted in patients with kidney cancer 
(KC). The aim of this scoping review focused on PA in patients with KC was to 
summarize current findings, delineate strengths and limitations, and provide key 
recommendations for future research. A scoping review was conducted and reported 
in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. The electronic databases 
of PubMed and Cochrane Library were screened for studies on October 14, 2021, 
and the search was updated on October 31, 2021. The data were abstracted and 
synthesized by study design. A total of 17 articles from nine independent 
studies were identified including 1 cross-sectional study (n = 8 articles), 1 
randomized controlled trial (n = 2 articles) and 7 cohort studies (n = 7 
articles). The cross-sectional study and randomized controlled trial reported on 
PA participation rates, preferences, social-cognitive correlates, and quality of 
life in patients with KC. The 7 cohort studies mostly reported on the risk of KC 
mortality in general population samples. Overall, no conclusions can be drawn 
from current research on the safety, feasibility, and efficacy (benefits and 
harms) of PA in patients with KC. Future research is urgently needed on PA in 
patients with KC, taking into account their unique disease- and 
treatment-related factors. This research is necessary to inform clinical 
exercise guidelines in this understudied cancer patient group.

The ladybird Eriopis connexa is an important natural enemy of several pest 
arthropods in agroecosystems. High population of this predator is frequently 
observed in strawberry and soybean crops associated with spider mites. We used 
two-sex life table parameters to evaluate under laboratory conditions, the 
suitability of three species of spider mites (Tetranychus evansi, Tetranychus 
urticae, Tetranychus ogmophallos), and a species of aphid (Myzus persicae) as a 
prey for the predator E. connexa. Eriopis connexa completed immature development 
on all prey species except on T. evansi, in which all individuals of predator 
died before reaching the pupal stage. Among prey species that allowed the 
immature development of E. connexa, T. urticae and M. persicae provided a faster 
development time to the predator. Oviposition days, longevity and fecundity of 
E. connexa on T. urticae and M. persicae were substantially longer/higher than 
on T. ogmophallos. Net reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), 
and finite rate of increase (λ) of E. connexa feeding on T. urticae and M. 
persicae were also higher than those on T. ogmophallos. Based on the overall 
performance of the ladybird, the order of suitability of prey species was M. 
persicae > T. urticae > T. ogmophallos > T. evansi.

BACKGROUND: It has been established that lung cancer is the leading cause of all 
cancer deaths. This study sought to analyze the epidemiological trends of lung 
cancer over the past 30 years worldwide.
METHODS: Estimates, including the global, regional, national prevalence, 
incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) of lung cancer from 1990 to 
2019, were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to assess the 
spatiotemporal dynamics in cases and age-standardized rates (ASR). The estimated 
annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to evaluate the variation in ASR. 
Besides, estimates of age-sex specific prevalence, decomposition analysis for 
incident cases, and correlation analysis of the EAPC were conducted in our 
study.
RESULTS: Globally, the ASR of lung cancer prevalence, incidence and YLDs in 2019 
were 38.84/100,000 persons, 27.66/100,000 persons, and 6.62/100,000 persons, 
respectively. Over the past 30 years, the ASR of incidence (EAPC = -0.09) 
decreased, although that of prevalence (EAPC = 0.51) and YLDs (EAPC = 0.03) 
increased. The global prevalence counts was greater in males than females at all 
age groups and increased with age, peaking in the 65-69 age group for both 
sexes. The increase in incidence was mainly attributed to population aging. For 
YLDs, EAPC was negatively correlated with the human development index 
(p = 0.0008) and ASR (p < 0.0001) in 1990 across nation-level units.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer remains a major public health issue globally, 
warranting the implementation of scientific and effective measures in different 
countries and territories to control it.

Despite the passage of over 30 years since its discovery, the importance of 
feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on the health and longevity of infected 
domestic cats is hotly debated amongst feline experts. Notwithstanding the 
absence of good quality information, Australian and New Zealand (NZ) 
veterinarians should aim to minimise the exposure of cats to FIV. The most 
reliable way to achieve this goal is to recommend that all pet cats are kept 
exclusively indoors, or with secure outdoor access (e.g., cat enclosures, secure 
gardens), with FIV testing of any in-contact cats. All animal holding facilities 
should aim to individually house adult cats to limit the spread of FIV infection 
in groups of animals that are stressed and do not have established social 
hierarchies. Point-of-care (PoC) FIV antibody tests are available in Australia 
and NZ that can distinguish FIV-infected and uninfected FIV-vaccinated cats 
(Witness™ and Anigen Rapid™). Although testing of whole blood, serum or plasma 
remains the gold standard for FIV diagnosis, PoC testing using saliva may offer 
a welfare-friendly alternative in the future. PCR testing to detect FIV 
infection is not recommended as a screening procedure since a negative PCR 
result does not rule out FIV infection and is only recommended in specific 
scenarios. Australia and NZ are two of three countries where a dual subtype FIV 
vaccine (Fel-O-Vax® FIV) is available and offers a further avenue for disease 
prevention. Since FIV vaccination only has a reported field effectiveness of 56% 
in Australia, and possibly lower in NZ, FIV-vaccinated cats should undergo 
annual FIV testing prior to annual FIV re-vaccination using a suitable PoC kit 
to check infection has not occurred in the preceding year. With FIV-infected 
cats, clinicians should strive to be even more thorough than usual at detecting 
early signs of disease. The most effective way to enhance the quality of life 
and life expectancy of FIV-infected cats is to optimise basic husbandry and to 
treat any concurrent conditions early in the disease course. Currently, no 
available drugs are registered for the treatment of FIV infection. Critically, 
the euthanasia of healthy FIV-infected cats, and sick FIV-infected cats without 
appropriate clinical investigations, should not occur.

University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.

BACKGROUND: Donafenib and lenvatinib are approved by China National Medical 
Products Administration and recommended as first-line treatment of Metastatic 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of donafenib compared with lenvatinib for first-line 
treatment of advanced HCC in China.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model consisting with three health states was 
developed to simulate lifetime development of advanced HCC from China healthcare 
payer's perspective. The lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
life-years (LYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were 
calculated. The efficacy data were obtained from ZGDH3 and REFLECT trials. The 
cost and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 5%. Sensitivity and 
scenario analyses were carried out to explore the variation of model results.
RESULTS: Compared with lenvatinib, donafenib incurred more costs of $1500.86 and 
had 0.139 QALYs gained, resulting in an ICER of $10,790.18/QALY. The probability 
of being cost-effective was 84.9% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of gross 
domestic product per capita in 2020 in China ($31,499.2/QALY). Sensitive and 
scenario analysis results were in line with base-case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Donafenib appears to be a cost-effective strategy compared with 
lenvatinib for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic HCC in China.

BACKGROUND: Because trends in the epidemiology and burden of gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD) are changing, reinvestigating the geographical differences 
and trend changes is essential. Here we evaluated the latest epidemiologic 
patterns and trends for GERD, using data from Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.
METHODS: Annual case numbers, age-standardized rates of prevalence, incidence, 
and years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and their estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPCs) for GERD between 1990 and 2019 were derived from the 
GBD 2019 study. Association between GERD burden and socio-demographic index 
(SDI) was also investigated.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 783.95 million cases of GERD globally. Between 1990 
and 2019, the total number of prevalent cases, incident cases, and YLDs 
increased by 77.53%, 74.79%, and 77.19%, respectively. The global 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized YLD rate (ASYR) 
increased during this period (EAPC = 0.06 and 0.05, respectively). Tropical 
Latin America and East Asia had the highest and lowest age-standardiZed 
prevalence rate (ASPR), ASIR, and ASYR in 2019, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, 
prevalent cases, incident cases, YLDs, and their corresponding age-standardized 
rates of GERD were higher in females than males in all years. Higher SDI was 
associated with lower ASPR, ASIR, and ASYR of GERD in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: GERD will continue to be a major public health burden due to 
increasing numbers of prevalent cases, incident cases, and YLDs. In order to 
tackle this troublesome disease, it is crucial to understand the changes in both 
global and regional trends in epidemiology and the burden for policymakers and 
other stakeholders. Key messagesThis is the most updated estimate on GERD 
epidemiology globally, including 204 countries, some of which were not assessed 
before.The overall burden of GERD continued to worsen with the prevalent cases 
increasing by 77.53% from 441.57 million in 1990 to 783.95 million in 2019.GERD 
is likely to remain a common reason for consultation in primary care, and our 
data may allow for health service provision planning.

United Kingdom: Health System Review.

This analysis provides a review of developments in financing, governance, 
organisation and delivery, health reforms and performance of the health systems 
in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has enjoyed a national health service 
with access based on clinical need, and not ability to pay for over 70 years. 
This has provided several important benefits including protection against the 
financial consequences of ill-health, redistribution of wealth from rich to 
poor, and relatively low administrative costs. Despite this, the United Kingdom 
continues to lag behind many other comparable high-income countries in key 
measures including life expectancy, infant mortality and cancer survival. Total 
health spending in the United Kingdom is slightly above the average for Europe, 
but it is below many other comparable high-income countries such as Germany, 
France and Canada. The United Kingdom also has relatively lower levels of 
doctors, nurses, hospital beds and equipment than many other comparable 
high-income countries. Wider social determinants of health also contribute to 
poor outcomes, and the United Kingdom has one of the highest levels of income 
inequality in Europe. Devolution of responsibility for health care services 
since the late 1990s to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has resulted in 
divergence in policies between countries, including in prescription charges, and 
eligibility for publicly funded social care services. However, more 
commonalities than differences remain between these health care systems. The 
United Kingdom initially experienced one of the highest death rates associated 
with COVID-19; however, the success and speed of the United Kingdom's 
vaccination programme has since improved the United Kingdom's performance in 
this respect. Principal health reforms in each country are focusing on 
facilitating cross-sectoral partnerships and promoting integration of services 
in a manner that improves the health and well-being of local populations. These 
include the establishment of integrated care systems in England, integrated 
joint boards in Scotland, regional partnership boards in Wales and integrated 
partnership boards in Northern Ireland. Policies are also being developed to 
align the social care funding model closer to the National Health Service 
funding model. These include a cap on costs over an individual's lifetime in 
England, and a national care service free at the point of need in Scotland and 
Wales. Currently, and for the future, significant investment is needed to 
address major challenges including a growing backlog of elective care, and 
staffing shortfalls exacerbated by Brexit.

Up to half of all patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer will eventually acquire brain 
metastases (BrMs), which are associated with reduced overall survival and 
decreased quality of life. Although the median overall survival was previously 
less than a year, novel systemic treatments have significantly extended life 
expectancy in patients with HER2+ breast cancer BrMs. The current first-line 
standard of care for all patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, 
regardless of BrMs status, is dual HER2 antibody therapy with 
pertuzumab/trastuzumab plus a taxane. Second-line systemic therapy has recently 
evolved, with the option of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) or tucatinib in 
combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. T-DXd has shown dramatically 
superior progression-free survival in comparison with trastuzumab emtansine 
(T-DM1) in patients with stable BrMs in the second-line setting. Patients who 
have untreated or locally treated/progressive BrMs may benefit from a regimen 
with robust intracranial response rates, such as tucatinib in combination with 
trastuzumab and capecitabine. Third-line therapy and beyond includes multiple 
options that require careful selection, with the patient's BrMs status, 
comorbidities, and performance status taken into account. In this review, we 
focus on current management and evolving strategies for the treatment of 
patients with HER2+ breast cancer BrMs.

PURPOSE: Frailty has been found to be associated with poor quality of life (QoL) 
in older people, but data available are limited to cross-sectional studies. We 
therefore aimed to assess the association between multidimensional frailty, 
determined by Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), with mortality and good 
QoL expectancy (GQoLE) in a large representative sample of older adults, over 
10 years of follow-up.
METHODS: In the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, using the data from 
2004-2005 and 2014-2015, MPI was calculated using a weighted score of domains of 
comprehensive geriatric assessment, i.e., number of difficulties in activities 
of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL, depressive symptoms, number of 
medical conditions, body mass index, physical activity level, and social 
aspects. Mortality was assessed using administrative data, GQoLE indicators were 
used for longitudinal changes in QoL.
RESULTS: 6244 Participants (mean age 71.8 years, 44.5% males) were followed up 
for 10 years. After adjusting for potential confounders, compared to people in 
the MPI low-risk group, people in the moderate (hazard ratio, HR = 4.27; 95% 
confidence interval, CI 3.55-5.14) and severe-risk group (HR = 10.3; 95% CI 
7.88-13.5) experienced a significantly higher mortality rate. During the 
follow-up period, people in the moderate and severe-risk groups reported lower 
GQoLE values than their counterparts, independently from age and gender.
CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional frailty was associated with a higher risk of 
mortality and significantly lower GQoLE, suggesting that the multifactorial 
nature of frailty is associated not only with mortality, but also poor QoL.

INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug reaction reports are usually manually assessed by 
pharmacovigilance experts to detect safety signals associated with drugs. With 
the recent extension of reporting to patients and the emergence of mass 
media-related sanitary crises, adverse drug reaction reports currently 
frequently overwhelm pharmacovigilance networks. Artificial intelligence could 
help support the work of pharmacovigilance experts during such crises, by 
automatically coding reports, allowing them to prioritise or accelerate their 
manual assessment. After a previous study showing first results, we developed 
and compared state-of-the-art machine learning models using a larger nationwide 
dataset, aiming to automatically pre-code patients' adverse drug reaction 
reports.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the best artificial intelligence model 
identifying adverse drug reactions and assessing seriousness in patients reports 
from the French national pharmacovigilance web portal.
METHODS: Reports coded by 27 Pharmacovigilance Centres between March 2017 and
