BACKGROUND: Guidelines differ on screening recommendations for latent 
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) prior to immunosuppressive therapy. We aimed to 
determine the most cost-effective LTBI screening strategy before long-term 
steroid therapy in a child with new-onset idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.
STUDY DESIGN: Markov state-transition model.
SETTING & POPULATION: 5-year-old boy with new-onset idiopathic nephrotic 
syndrome.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: The Markov model took a societal perspective 
over a lifetime horizon.
INTERVENTION: 3 strategies were compared: universal tuberculin skin testing 
(TST), targeted screening using a risk-factor questionnaire, and no screening. A 
secondary model included the newer interferon γ release assays (IGRAs), 
requiring only one visit and having greater specificity than TST.
OUTCOMES: Marginal cost-effectiveness ratios (2010 US dollars) with 
effectiveness measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: At an LTBI prevalence of 1.1% (the average US childhood prevalence in 
our base case), a no-screening strategy dominated ($2,201; 29.3356 QALYs) 
targeted screening ($2,218; 29.3356 QALYs) and universal TST ($2,481; 29.3347 
QALYs). At a prevalence >10.3%, targeted screening with a risk-factor 
questionnaire was the most cost-effective option. Higher than a prevalence of 
58.5%, universal TST was preferred. In the secondary model, targeted screening 
with a questionnaire followed by IGRA testing was cost-effective compared with 
no screening in the base case when the LTBI prevalence was >4.9%.
LIMITATIONS: There is no established gold standard for the diagnosis of LTBI. 
Results of any modeling task are limited by the accuracy of available data.
CONCLUSIONS: Prior to starting steroid therapy, only patients in areas with a 
high prevalence of LTBI will benefit from universal TST. As more evidence 
becomes available about the use of IGRA testing in children, the assay may 
become a component of cost-effective screening protocols in populations with a 
higher burden of LTBI.

OBJECTIVES: We have shown that a Breakthrough Series-based implementation 
program increases the number of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with 
alteplase 4.5% in real-life settings. It is unclear whether such an 
implementation program is cost-effective.
METHODS: The practice study includes 12 randomized hospitals and 5,515 patients. 
Its present cost-effectiveness analysis involves 1,657 patients with ischemic 
stroke admitted within 4 hours from onset. Defined primary outcomes are 
thrombolysis rate and actual health care costs up to 3 months, including 
additional implementation efforts. Secondary outcomes are lifetime 
quality-adjusted years (QALYs) and lifetime costs of individual trial patients, 
using a validated probabilistic, disability-stratified stroke life table. 
Differences in outcome include 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for 
intracluster correlation.
RESULTS: The thrombolysis rate in the intervention group was 44.3% vs 39.8% in 
the control group (difference 4.5%; 95% CI 3.1% to 5.9%. Mean costs per patient 
at 3 months (euros were converted to 2010 USD) were $9,192 USD in the 
intervention group and $9,647 USD in the control group (difference -$455 USD; 
95% CI -$232 to -$679 USD). Lifetime QALYs in the intervention group were 3.89 
and in the control group 3.84 (difference 0.05; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.14). The mean 
lifetime costs in the intervention group were $22,994 USD against $24,315 USD in 
the control group (difference -$1,321 USD; 95% CI -$1,722 to -$921 USD).
CONCLUSIONS: A Breakthrough Series implementation program of thrombolysis 
increases thrombolysis. It saves short- and long-term health care costs due to 
lower hospital admission and residential costs, increasing stroke care 
efficiency.

Factors associated with the use of uterine cervical cancer screening services in 
korean elderly women.

Ko KD(1), Park SM, Lee K.

National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

BACKGROUND: The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test is an effective screening test for 
the early detection of uterine cervical cancer. The Pap test still plays an 
important role in Korean elderly women, as uterine cervical cancer remains a 
frequent form of cancer and an important cause of death. However, the 
participation rate and other factors related to the Pap test in Korean elderly 
women have been studied insufficiently.
METHODS: This study included 654 individuals aged 65 and over who completed a 
cervical cancer screening questionnaire from the Third Korean National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005. Using multiple logistic regression, odds 
ratios and confidence intervals for the association between attendance of the 
Pap test and sociodemographic or health-related factors were calculated.
RESULTS: One hundred and eleven individuals (17.0%) of the study population 
showed compliance with Pap testing within the previous 2 years. We recognized 
that the most elderly women (75 years and over) or those with lower levels of 
education were less likely to have had the test.
CONCLUSION: Primary health care providers need to make efforts to improve 
attendance rates of Pap smear screening in Korean elderly women, individually 
taking into account previous Pap results, life expectancy, risk factors for 
cervical cancer, and preferences. More attention will especially be needed among 
the eldest elderly or less educated elderly women.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmaceutical and other treatments 
for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has the potential to improve 
access to services by demonstrating the value of treatment to public and private 
payers, but methods for measuring QALYs in children are under-studied. No 
cost-effectiveness analyses have been undertaken in this population using the 
cost-per-QALY metric.
OBJECTIVE: This study describes health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) outcomes 
in children with ASDs and compares the sensitivity of two generic 
preference-based instruments relative to ASD-related conditions and symptoms.
METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional with prospectively collected 
outcome data that were correlated with retrospectively assessed clinical 
information. Subjects were recruited from two sites of the Autism Treatment 
Network (ATN) in the US: a developmental centre in Little Rock, Arkansas, and an 
outpatient psychiatric clinic at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. 
Children that met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for an ASD by a multidisciplinary team evaluation were 
asked to participate in a clinical registry. Families of children with an ASD 
that agreed to be contacted about participation in future research studies as 
part of the ATN formed the sampling frame for the study. Families were included 
if the child with the ASD was between 4 and 17 years of age and the family 
caregiver spoke English. Eligible families were contacted by mail to see if they 
would be interested in participating in the study with 150 completing surveys. 
HR-QOL outcomes were described using the Health Utilities Index (HUI) 3 and the 
Quality of Well-Being Self-Administered (QWB-SA) scale obtained by proxy via the 
family caregiver.
RESULTS: Children were diagnosed as having autistic disorder (76%), pervasive 
developmental disorder-not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS] (15%), and Asperger's 
disorder (9%). Average HUI3 and QWB-SA scores were 0.68 (SD 0.21, range 0.07-1) 
and 0.59 (SD 0.16, range 0.18-1), respectively. The HUI3 score was significantly 
correlated with clinical variables including adaptive behaviour (ρ = 0.52; 
p < 0.001) and cognitive functioning (ρ = 0.36; p < 0.001). The QWB-SA score had 
weak correlation with adaptive behaviour (ρ = 0.25; p < 0.001) and cognitive 
functioning (ρ = 0.17; p < 0.005). Change scores for the HUI3 were larger than 
the QWB-SA for all clinical measures. Scores for the HUI3 increased 0.21 points 
(95% CI 0.14, 0.29) across the first to the third quartile of the cognitive 
functioning measure compared with 0.05 (95% CI -0.01, 0.11) for the QWB-SA. 
Adjusted R2 values also were higher for the HUI3 compared with the QWB-SA across 
all clinical measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The HUI3 was more sensitive to clinical measures used to 
characterize children with autism compared with the QWB-SA score. The findings 
provide a benchmark to compare scores obtained by alternative methods and 
instruments. Researchers should consider incorporating the HUI3 in clinical 
trials and other longitudinal research studies to build the evidence base for 
describing the cost effectiveness of services provided to this important 
population.

Developing adolescent-specific health state values for economic evaluation: an 
application of profile case best-worst scaling to the Child Health Utility 9D.

BACKGROUND: The way that health is measured and valued is fundamental to 
economic evaluation. To date, adult health state values have been routinely used 
in the calculation of QALYs for the economic evaluation of healthcare treatment 
and preventive programmes, including those targeted at adolescents.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to apply profile case 
best-worst scaling (BWS) discrete-choice experiment (DCE) methods to obtain 
adolescent-specific values for the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D), a new 
generic preference-based measure of health-related quality of life developed 
specifically for application in cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments and 
interventions targeted at young people. A secondary aim was to assess the 
feasibility of a web-based method of data collection for the valuation of health 
states defined by the CHU9D.
METHODS: A web-based survey was developed including the CHU9D instrument and a 
series of BWS DCE questions. Specifically, respondents were asked to indicate 
the best and worst attribute levels from a series of ten health states defined 
by the CHU9D, presented one at a time. The survey was administered to a 
community-based sample of consenting adolescents (n = 590) aged 11-17 years. A 
conditional logistic regression model was applied to estimate values (part-worth 
utilities) for each level of the nine attributes relating to the CHU9D. A 
marginal utility matrix was then estimated to generate an adolescent-specific 
scoring algorithm on the full health = 1 and dead = 0 scale required for the 
calculation of QALYs.
RESULTS: The results indicate that participants were able to readily choose 
'best' and 'worst' attribute levels for the CHU9D health states. Large 
differences in value were found between the first and fifth levels (indicating 
'no problems' and 'severe problems', respectively) for all nine attributes 
relating to the CHU9D. In general, there was little differentiation between the 
middle levels of all attributes indicating only limited additional value for 
adolescents of moving between these levels. Comparison of the 
adolescent-specific algorithm and the existing adult scoring algorithm for the 
CHU9D revealed some significant differences in values for identical health 
states, which may have important implications for the application of the CHU9D 
to value adolescent treatment and service programmes particularly for mental 
health. In general, adolescents appeared to place more weight upon the CHU9D 
attributes relating to mental health (worried, sad and annoyed) than would be 
implied by application of the existing algorithm based upon adult values.
CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary indications that there may be 
potentially important and systematic differences in the valuations attached to 
identical health states by adolescents in comparison with adult population 
groups. The study findings lend support to the potential future application of 
profile case BWS DCE methods to undertake large-scale health state valuation 
studies directly with young adolescent population samples and provide support 
for the feasibility and acceptability of a web-based mode of administration for 
this purpose.

Research-ScHARR, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of 
estimating preference weights for all health states defined by the Child Health 
Utility 9D (CHU9D), a new generic measure of health-related quality of life for 
children aged 7-11 years. The estimation of preference weights will allow the 
calculation of QALYs for use in paediatric economic evaluation.
METHODS: Valuation interviews were undertaken with 300 members of the UK adult 
general population to obtain preference weights for a sample of the health 
states in the CHU9D descriptive system. Both standard gamble and ranking 
valuation methods were used. Regression modelling was undertaken to estimate 
models that could predict a value for every health state defined by the system. 
A range of models were tested and were evaluated based on their predictive 
performance.
RESULTS: Models estimated on the standard gamble data performed better than the 
rank model. All models had a few inconsistencies or insignificant levels and so 
further modelling was done to estimate a parsimonious consistent regression 
model using the general-to-specific approach, by combining inconsistent levels 
and removing non-significant levels. The final preferred model was an ordinary 
least squares (OLS) model. All the coefficients in this model were significant, 
there were no inconsistencies and the model had the best predictive performance 
and a low mean absolute error.
CONCLUSION: This research has demonstrated it is feasible to value the CHU9D 
descriptive system, and preference weights for each health state can be 
generated to allow the calculation of QALYs. The CHU9D can now be used in the 
economic evaluation of paediatric healthcare interventions. Further research is 
needed to investigate the impact of children's preferences for the health states 
and what methods could be used to obtain these preferences.

Cost effectiveness of guanfacine extended release as an adjunctive therapy to a 
stimulant compared with stimulant monotherapy for the treatment of 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common 
psychiatric disorder in childhood, affecting 3-7% of school-age children in the 
US and imposing substantial economic burden. Stimulants are considered 
first-line pharmacological treatment and are the most prescribed treatment for 
ADHD. However, approximately 30% of children with ADHD do not have an optimal 
response to a single stimulant and may require adjunctive therapy.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of 
adding a non-stimulant, guanfacine extended release (GXR), to stimulants versus 
maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children 
and adolescents with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy.
METHODS: A 1-year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effectiveness 
from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness was measured by the QALY. 
The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states (normal, 
mild, moderate and severe), defined by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity 
(CGI-S) scale. Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model 
using patient-level data from a multicentre, 9-week, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, where subjects (n = 461) continued 
their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the 
morning, GXR administered in the evening, or placebo. The model assumed that 
patients in moderate/severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD 
treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period. Direct 
costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs, all in 
$US, year 2010 values. Utility associated with each health state was obtained 
from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied 
for the first 4 weeks. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted by varying costs, utilities, 
adverse-event duration, and transition probabilities.
RESULTS: Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy, adding GXR to 
existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of 
$US1016 but a lower medical cost of $US124, resulting in a total incremental 
cost of $US892 at 1 year. The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an 
incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$US31,660/QALY. In one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER values ranged from 
$US19,723, when 100% of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial 
health state, to $US46,631, when the last observed states from the clinical 
trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period. PSA 
demonstrated a 94.6% likelihood that the ICER falls below $US50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The impairment associated with residual ADHD symptoms after 
stimulant therapy is becoming increasingly recognized. This is the first 
analysis of the cost effectiveness of stimulants combined with an adjunctive 
medication. This study suggests that the adjunctive therapy of GXR with 
stimulants is a cost-effective treatment based on a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $US50,000/QALY. This may address an unmet need among patients with suboptimal 
response to stimulant monotherapy.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To conduct an in-depth qualitative examination of the 
experiences of Singaporean people caring for those with Parkinson's disease 
(PD).
BACKGROUND: The need to provide care for people with PD will increase with the 
extended life expectancy of Singaporeans. Caring for people with PD in their own 
homes for as long as possible is argued to provide psychosocial benefits as well 
as benefiting the community by delayed institutionalisation and reduced 
healthcare costs.
DESIGN: This study reports the qualitative exploratory component of a large 
mixed method sequential explanatory design.
METHODS: Caregivers were selected through a purposive sampling technique and 
stratified based on the Hoehn and Yahr disease staging. Twenty-one 
semi-structured interviews were conducted in the home setting. Interviews were 
audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. The qualitative data were analysed using 
Ritchie and Spencer's framework method of qualitative analysis (1994, Analyzing 
Qualitative Data, Routledge, London).
RESULTS: Seventeen (81%) caregivers were women, and their ages ranged from 31 
years to more than 71 years. The length of the interview ranged from 42-106 
minutes. The interview transcriptions produced 1731 free nodes, and after 
careful scrutiny for redundancy, 11 sub-themes were identified, which were 
organised into four key themes. These themes pertained to: (1) Coping and 
adaptation, (2) Challenges of caregiving, (3) Effects of caregiving on the 
caregivers and the (4) Need for better caregiver support.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study have provided insights into the coping and 
well-being of caregivers of people with PD. The progressive nature of PD placed 
a significant burden on caregivers' emotional well-being. The findings of this 
study underscore the need for formal caregiver support and education to reduce 
strain in caregivers targeted at every stage of PD as there is no clear pattern 
of disease progression.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study has provided important findings that 
will inform the construction of interventional strategies to reduce caregiver 
burden and the provision of better support services for caregivers.

Gender differences in quality of life after stroke and TIA: a cross-sectional 
survey of out-patients.

Franzén-Dahlin Å(1), Laska AC.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore how a stroke or a transient ischemic attack 
affects quality of life and to identify gender differences.
BACKGROUND: The negative effect of a stroke on the patients' quality of life has 
previously been studied, while the effect on patients with transient ischemic 
attack (TIA) is more unknown, especially in relation to gender. As poor quality 
of life may have a negative effect on rehabilitation it is important to 
investigate quality of life in this group.
DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional survey.
METHODS: All stroke and transient ischemic attack patients appointed to the 
out-patient stroke clinic between May 2008-August 2009 were asked to complete 
the Nottingham Health Profile.
RESULTS: Of 1048 patients, 379 (50%) of the stroke patients and 117 (40%) of the 
patients with transient ischemic attack completed the form within the first 
months after onset. Female stroke patients were significantly more negatively 
affected in all domains except the social domain than were male stroke patients. 
Female transient ischemic attack patients were significantly more negatively 
affected in all domains than were male transient ischemic attack patients. Male 
stroke patients had a significantly more negatively affected quality of life 
than male transient ischemic attack patients in the emotional, energy, social 
and total domains, while female stroke patients and female transient ischemic 
attack patients were equally negatively affected.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that female stroke patients are more negatively 
affected in their quality of life than male stroke patients and that female 
transient ischemic attack patients are as affected as female stroke patients. 
This indicates that female patients with both stroke and TIA need more attention 
concerning their life situation.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Increased knowledge about how transient ischemic 
attack patients are affected, indicate that this group need support 
postdischarge to the same extension as stroke patients.

Cancer resistance to type II topoisomerase inhibitors.

Pilati P(1), Nitti D, Mocellin S.

Author information:
(1)Department of Oncological and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy.

Type II topoisomerases (TOPO2) are ubiquitously expressed enzymes that overcome 
topological problems in genomic DNA, which can result from DNA replication, 
transcription and repair. The class of compounds targeting TOPO2 includes some 
of the most active chemotherapy agents currently available for the treatment of 
patients with different cancer types. Therefore, understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying resistance to these drugs is of pivotal importance to 
improve their efficacy and ultimately increase the life expectancy of cancer 
patients. The first aim of this review is to summarize the molecular biology of 
TOPO2 inhibitors, which is the key to understand cancer resistance to them; the 
second part of this work is dedicated to overview and discuss the available 
evidence on the mechanisms of resistance to these drugs, with special attention 
to the strategies that might be useful to circumvent this phenomenon on the 
clinical ground.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac injury is one of the most impairing side effects of 
anticancer treatment. The extension of the range of available drugs, the use of 
combination regimens and the association with radiation therapy have improved 
life expectancy; however, they have also caused a rising typology of cardiac 
toxicities, including not only congestive heart failure, but also myocardial 
ischemia, thromboembolism, hypertension and arrhythmias.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to describe the evidence of association 
between bradyarrhythmias and antineoplastic agents, including chemotherapeutic 
and molecular-targeted drugs in the adult population, to summarize the possible 
mechanisms of onset and to make suggestions for clinical management. A Medline 
search for each anticancer agent and associated cardiotoxic, 
electrocardiographic and arrhythmic alteration was performed for the years 
January 1970 - January 2012. A cross-referencing search from identified studies 
was also carried out. Published reports from clinical trials, non-randomized 
studies, case reports and recent reviews were considered. Only agents with a 
specific relation to bradyarrhythmias were included and are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: A greater knowledge of this specific cardiac toxicity may help 
appropriate risk stratification and correct management during treatment and 
follow-up. The exchange of information among hematologists, oncologists and 
cardiologists is essential for this purpose.

jointly for females and males.

We examine the application of a Poisson common factor model for the projection 
of mortality jointly for females and males. The model structure is an extension 
of the classical Lee-Carter method in which there is a common factor for the 
aggregate population, while a number of additional sex-specific factors can also 
be incorporated. The Poisson distribution is a natural choice for modelling the 
number of deaths, and its use provides a formal statistical framework for model 
selection, parameter estimation, and data analysis. Our results for Australian 
data show that this model leads to projected life expectancy values similar to 
those produced by the separate projection of mortality for females and males, 
but possesses the additional advantage of ensuring that the projected 
male-to-female ratio for death rates at each age converges to a constant. 
Moreover, the randomness of the corresponding residuals indicates that the model 
fit is satisfactory.

OBJECTIVE: It is well established that serious mental illness is associated with 
raised mortality, yet few studies have looked at the life expectancy of people 
with personality disorder (PD). This study aims to examine the life expectancy 
and relative mortality in people with PD within secondary mental health care.
METHODS: We set out to examine this using a large psychiatric case register in 
southeast London, UK. Mortality was obtained through national mortality tracing 
procedures. In a cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of PD (n=1836), 
standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and life expectancies at birth were 
calculated, using general population mortality statistics as the comparator.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth was 63.3 years for women and 59.1 years for 
men with PD-18.7 years and 17.7 years shorter than females and males 
respectively in the general population in England and Wales. The SMR was 4.2 
(95% CI: 3.03-5.64) overall; 5.0 (95% CI: 3.15-7.45) for females and 3.5 (95% 
CI: 2.17-5.47) for males. The highest SMRs were found in the younger age groups 
for both genders.
CONCLUSION: People with PD using mental health services have a substantially 
reduced life expectancy, highlighting the significant public health burden of 
the disorder.

Glycemic management in diabetes and the associated cardiovascular risk: are we 
helping or hurting our patients?

Diabetes, which is a metabolic disorder with multiple comorbidities, increases 
the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although it was once assumed that 
controlling plasma glucose levels would reduce diabetes-related morbidity and 
mortality, recent trials have demonstrated that this is not consistently the 
case. Data from large, well-designed trials suggest that intensive glycemic 
therapy may be useful in preventing cardiovascular events if initiated early in 
the disease course, but may be harmful or not useful if applied to high-risk 
patients with a longer history of diabetes. Furthermore, the cardiovascular 
safety of existing individual antihyperglycemic agents remains largely unknown. 
We review the relationship between glycemic control targets and cardiovascular 
outcomes, as well as the current understanding of the cardiovascular effects of 
existing glucose-lowering therapies. This information has affected 
recommendations for diabetes care in Japan and the United States differently, 
and supports a more comprehensive and prospective approach to cardiovascular 
safety assessments of diabetes therapies in the future. Results from ongoing 
cardiovascular outcomes trials of diabetes medications may help to define 
optimal glucose-lowering strategies for patients at high risk of cardiovascular 
complications. Until then, glycemic control targets and the medications used to 
achieve them should be individualized according to each patient's age, duration 
of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia, risk of cardiovascular complications, and 
life expectancy.

Trajectories of changes over twelve years in the health status of Canadians from 
late middle age.

Aging in a given individual can be characterized by the number of deficits 
(symptoms, signs, laboratory abnormalities, disabilities) that they accumulate. 
The number of accumulated deficits, more than their nature, well characterizes 
health status in individuals - the proportion of deficits present in an 
individual to deficits considered is known as a frailty index. While on average 
deficits accumulate with age, individual trajectories in the number of deficits 
is highly dynamic. Transitions in the number of deficits over a fixed time 
interval can be represented by the Poisson law, with the Poisson mean dependent 
on the deficit numbers at baseline. Here we present an extension of the model to 
make possible predictions for any given time period. Using data from the 
Canadian National Population Health Survey of people aged 55 and over (n=4330), 
followed during 7cycles being the baseline and 6cycles of follow-up every 
2years, we found that the transition in the number of deficits during any time 
period can be approximated using a time dependent Poisson distribution with the 
Poisson mean tending to decelerate over time, according to square-root-of-time 
kinetics characteristic for stochastic processes (e.g. diffusion, Brownian 
motion ) while the probability of death shows a pattern of time acceleration 
with a high degree of precision, "explaining" over 98% of variance. The model 
predicts a variety of changes in health status including the possibility of 
health improvement indicating the repair/remodeling abilities of the organism. 
The model is valuable for estimating how changes in health can influence 
mortality across the life course from late middle age.

Epidemic studies have shown that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have shorter 
life expectancy than healthy persons, primarily due to cardiovascular events. 
The aim of our study was to explore inhibitory effects on atherosclerosis of RA 
patients by TNF-inhibitor etanercept (ETN). We studied six RA patients with 
moderate or high disease activity as defined by the European League Against 
Rheumatism (EULAR) disease activity score (DAS28-ESR) in spite of treatment with 
methotrexate (MTX) 8 mg/week. We measured their pulse wave velocity (PWV) before 
and after treatment with ETN 25 mg/week for one year. There were no additional 
medications other than ETN that might influence on atherosclerosis. Their PWV 
decreased in five of six patients and the average decreased from 1474.8 cm/sec 
to 1432.5 cm/sec. The average of DAS28-ESR score was significantly decreased 
from 5.56 to 2.87 and they achieved good response by the EULAR criteria. There 
were no significant changes in the blood pressure, serum lipid (total 
cholesterol and triglyceride) and HbA1c ; all values were within normal limits 
before and after ETN treatment. It is suggested that the improvement of PWV is 
due to anti-inflammatory effects, leading inhibition of atherosclerosis, of ETN 
in RA patients.

The chronological lifespan (CLS) of budding yeast is a model for the aging of 
post-mitotic cells in higher eukaryotes. We report here the development of a new 
method to assess yeast CLS. The new assay is simple, convenient and 
labor-saving. We applied this new method to screen natural compounds isolated 
from mushrooms and discovered beauveriolide I as a potent anti-aging agent.

countries: mathematical modelling analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a single optimal vaccination strategy exists 
across countries to deal with a future influenza pandemic by comparing the cost 
effectiveness of different strategies in various pandemic scenarios for three 
European countries.
DESIGN: Economic and epidemic modelling study.
SETTINGS: General populations in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United 
Kingdom.
DATA SOURCES: Country specific patterns of social contact and demographic data.
MODEL: An age structured susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered transmission 
model that describes how an influenza A virus will spread in the populations of 
Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
INTERVENTIONS: Comparison of four vaccination strategies: no vaccination, 
blanket vaccination, vaccination of elderly people (≥ 65 years), and vaccination 
of high transmitters (5-19 years). The four strategies were evaluated for 
scenarios in which a vaccine became available early or at the peak of the 
pandemic, and in which either everyone was initially susceptible or older age 
groups had pre-existing immunity.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: All vaccination strategies were cost effective (incremental cost per 
QALY gained, comparing intervention with non-intervention). In scenarios where 
the vaccine became available at the peak of the pandemic and there was 
pre-existing immunity among elderly people the incremental cost effectiveness 
ratios for vaccinating high transmitters were €7325 (£5815; $10,470) per QALY 
gained for Germany, €10,216 per QALY gained for the Netherlands, and €7280 per 
QALY gained for the United Kingdom. The most cost effective strategy not only 
differed across the pandemic scenarios but also between countries. Specifically, 
when the vaccine was available early in the pandemic and there was no 
pre-existing immunity, in Germany it would be most cost effective to vaccinate 
elderly people ( €940 per QALY gained), whereas it would be most cost effective 
to vaccinate high transmitters in both the Netherlands (€525 per QALY gained) 
and the United Kingdom (€163 per QALY gained). This difference in optimal 
strategies was due to differences in the demographic characteristics of the 
countries: Germany has a significantly higher proportion of elderly people 
compared with the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
CONCLUSIONS: No single vaccination strategy was most cost effective across 
countries. With aging populations, pre-existing immunity in particular could be 
of crucial importance for the cost effectiveness of options to mitigate a future 
influenza pandemic.

The ageing of the population is an issue in wealthy countries worldwide because 
of increasing costs for health care and welfare. Survival curves taken from 
demographic life tables may help shed light on the hypotheses that humans are 
living longer and that human populations are growing older. We describe a 
methodology that enables us to obtain separate measurements of scale and shape 
variances in survival curves. Specifically, 'living longer' is associated with 
the scale variance of survival curves, whereas 'growing older' is associated 
with the shape variance. We show how the scale and shape of survival curves have 
changed over time during recent decades, based on period and cohort female life 
tables for selected wealthy countries. Our methodology will be useful for 
performing better tracking of ageing statistics and it is possible that this 
methodology can help identify the causes of current trends in human ageing.

Long-term cost-utility analysis of exenatide once weekly versus insulin glargine 
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients in the US.

Samyshkin Y(1), Guillermin AL, Best JH, Brunell SC, Lloyd A.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term cost-utility 
of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with exenatide once weekly 
(EQW) compared with insulin glargine (IG) from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: A validated computer simulation model, the CORE Diabetes Model, was 
used to project lifetime clinical outcomes and direct medical costs. Direct 
medical costs included pharmacy costs and costs associated with the management 
of diabetes and its complications. The model was populated using patient 
characteristics (mean age: 57.9 years; mean diabetes duration: 7.9 years; mean 
HbA1(c): 8.3%; mean body mass index [BMI]: 32.3 kg/m(2)) and clinical data from 
a phase 3 clinical trial that compared EQW with IG in T2DM patients on a 
background of metformin alone or a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea 
(DURATION-3). All EQW patients were assumed to have stayed on treatment for 3 
years before switching to IG. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at 3% 
per year. Complication costs were derived from published sources. A range of 
sensitivity analyses was performed.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, and compared with IG, EQW was associated with 
an incremental cost of $3914 (SD = 2923). EQW was projected to increase life 
expectancy by 0.135 (SD = 0.216) years and to improve quality-adjusted life 
expectancy by 0.246 (SD = 0.147) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), generating 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $15,936/QALY. Assuming a 
payer's willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, EQW is therefore 
cost-effective compared to IG. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
confirmed EQW's cost-effective profile.
LIMITATIONS: Short-term changes (26 weeks) in surrogate end-points (e.g., 
HbA1(c,) weight, complications) from one clinical trial were used to project 
long-term future effects on clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with EQW is projected to be cost-effective compared to 
treatment with IG.

The efficacy of pulsed light to improve the safety of carpaccio has been 
investigated. Beef and tuna slices were superficially inoculated with 
approximately 3 log cfu/cm2 of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, 
Salmonella Typhimurium and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Fluences of 0.7, 2.1, 4.2, 
8.4 and 11.9 J/cm2 were assayed. Colour, sensory and shelf-life studies were 
carried out. Treatments at 8.4 and 11.9 J/cm2 inactivated the selected pathogens 
approximately by 1 log cfu/cm2, although they modified the colour parameters and 
had a negative effect on the sensory quality of the product. The raw attributes 
were not affected by fluences of 2.1 and 4.2J/cm2 immediately after the 
treatment, although changes were observed during storage. The inactivation 
obtained with these fluences was lower than 1 log cfu/cm2, which may not be 
negligible in case of cross-contamination at a food plant or at a food service 
facility. Pulsed light showed a greater impact on the sensory quality of tuna 
carpaccio compared to beef. None of the fluences assayed extended the shelf-life 
of either product.

OBJECTIVES: The nation-wide, community-based intensive hypertension detection 
and control program, as well as universal health insurance coverage, may well be 
contributing factors for helping Japan rank near the top among countries with 
the longest life expectancy. We sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of such 
a community-based intervention program, as no evidence has been available for 
this issue.
METHODS: The hypertension detection and control program was initiated in 1963 in 
full intervention and minimal intervention communities in Akita, Japan. We 
performed comparative cost-effectiveness and budget-impact analyses for the 
period 1964-1987 of the costs of public health services and treatment of 
patients with hypertension and stroke on the one hand, and incidence of stroke 
on the other in the full intervention and minimal intervention communities.
RESULTS: The program provided in the full intervention community was found to be 
cost saving 13 years after the beginning of program in addition to the fact of 
effectiveness that; the prevalence and incidence of stroke were consistently 
lower in the full intervention community than in the minimal intervention 
community throughout the same period. The incremental cost was minus 28,358 yen 
per capita over 24 years.
CONCLUSION: The community-based intensive hypertension detection and control 
program was found to be both effective and cost saving. The national 
government's policy to support this program may have contributed in part to the 
substantial decline in stroke incidence and mortality, which was largely 
responsible for the increase in Japanese life expectancy.

Cost-effectiveness of a community-based physical activity programme for adults 
(Be Active) in the UK: an economic analysis within a natural experiment.

Birmingham, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a physical activity programme 
(Be Active) aimed at city-dwelling adults living in Birmingham, UK.
METHODS: Very little is known about the cost-effectiveness of public health 
programmes to improve city-wide physical activity rates. This paper presents a 
cost-effectiveness analysis that compares a physical activity intervention (Be 
Active) with no intervention (usual care) using an economic model to quantify 
the reduction in disease risk over a lifetime. Metabolic equivalent minutes 
achieved per week, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and healthcare 
costs were all included as the main outcome measures in the model. A 
cost-benefit analysis was also conducted using 'willingness-to-pay' as a measure 
of value.
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions-that is, assuming that the benefits of 
increased physical activity are sustained over 5 years, participation in the Be 
Active programme increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.06 years, at an 
expected discounted cost of £3552, and thus the cost-effectiveness of Be Active 
is £400 per QALY. When the start-up costs of the programme are removed from the 
economic model, the cost-effectiveness is further improved to £16 per QALY. The 
societal value placed on the Be Active programme was greater than the operation 
cost therefore the Be Active physical activity intervention results in a net 
benefit to society.
CONCLUSIONS: Participation in Be Active appeared to be cost-effective and 
cost-beneficial. These results support the use of Be Active as part of a public 
health programme to improve physical activity levels within the Birmingham-wide 
population.
