Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized 
by chronic granulomatous lymphocytic cholangitis of the small bile ducts. PBC 
was a leading indication for liver transplant in the United States; with early 
diagnosis and treatment, the majority of patients with PBC have a normal life 
expectancy. Pathogenesis involves inflammatory damage of bile duct epithelium 
secondary to innate and adaptive immune responses, and toxicity from accumulated 
bile acids. Cholestasis and disease progression can lead to cirrhosis. 
Extrahepatic complications include dyslipidemia, metabolic bone disease, and 
fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a well-established 
therapy. Novel targeted therapeutics are being developed.

High-load resistance training (HL) may be contraindicated in older adults due to 
pre-existing health conditions (e.g. osteoarthritis). Low-load blood flow 
restricted (BFR) resistance training offers an alternative to HL with 
potentially similar strength improvement.
PURPOSE: To compare muscle strength, cross-sectional area (CSA), physical 
function, and quality of life (QOL) following 12-weeks of HL or BFR training in 
older adults at risk of mobility limitations.
METHODS: Thirty-six males and females (mean: 75.6years 95% confidence interval: 
[73.4-78.5], 1.67m [1.64-1.70], 74.3kg [69.8-78.8]) were randomly assigned to HL 
(70% of one repetition maximum [1-RM]) or low-load BFR (30% 1-RM coupled with a 
vascular restriction) exercise for the knee extensors and flexors twice per week 
for 12weeks. A control (CON) group performed light upper body resistance and 
flexibility training. Muscle strength, CSA of the quadriceps, 400-m walking 
speed, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and QOL were assessed before, 
midway and after training.
RESULTS: Within 6-weeks of HL training, increases in all strength measures and 
CSA were evident and the gains were significantly greater than the CON group 
(P<0.05). The BFR group had strength increases in leg extension and leg press 
1-RM tests, but were significantly lower in leg extension isometric maximum 
voluntary contraction (MVC) and leg extension 1-RM than the HL group (P<0.01). 
At 12-weeks HL and BFR training did not differ in MVC (P=0.14). Walking speed 
increased 4% among all training groups (P<0.01) and no changes were observed for 
overall SPPB score and QOL (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Both training programs resulted in muscle CSA improvements and HL 
training had more pronounced strength gains than BFR training after 6-weeks and 
were more similar to BFR after 12-weeks of training. These changes in both 
groups did not transfer to improvements in QOL, SPPB, and walking speed. Since 
both programs result in strength and CSA gains, albeit at different rates, 
future research should consider using a combination of HL and BFR training in 
older adults with profound muscle weakness and mobility limitations.

BACKGROUND: Surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases is effective at prolonging 
ambulation and life, but it can appear costly at first glance. We have studied 
the difference between the cost of surgery and reimbursement received, and the 
cost-effectiveness of surgery in a U.K. tertiary referral spinal center.
METHODS: A cost-versus-reimbursement and cost-utility analysis was performed in 
a prospective cohort of patients admitted for surgical treatment of spinal 
metastases. Outcome measures were health-related quality of life using the 
EuroQol EQ-5D-3L, Frankel score, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
treatment and reimbursement costs.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty consecutive patients were prospectively recruited, 
of whom 92 had information available for cost and reimbursement comparison, and 
100 had information to complete cost-utility analysis. Median cost of hospital 
treatment per patient was £20,752; median reimbursement received was £18,291, 
with a median shortfall of £1,967. Surgery in addition to radiotherapy over a 
lifetime horizon was both more effective and less costly than radiotherapy 
alone, and therefore was found to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that reimbursement to hospitals for 
surgical management of symptomatic spinal metastases in the United Kingdom is 
broadly in line with costs, and that there was an overall saving as a result of 
community care costs being mitigated by patients walking for longer, which is 
within the expected National Health Service threshold. Surgery for metastatic 
spinal tumors is effective and a good value for the money.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, which 
affected 35 million people in the world. The most practiced approach to improve 
the life expectancy of AD patients is to increase acetylcholine neurotransmitter 
level at cholinergic synapses by inhibition of cholinesterase enzymes. A series 
of unreported piperidone grafted spiropyrrolidines 8(a-p) were synthesized and 
evaluated in vitro for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities. Therein, compounds 8h and 8l 
displayed more potent AChE enzyme inhibition than standard drug with IC50 values 
of 1.88 and 1.37 µM, respectively. Molecular docking simulations for 8l 
possessing the most potent AChE inhibitory activities, disclosed its interesting 
binding templates to the active site channel of AChE enzymes. These compounds 
are remarkable AChE inhibitors and have potential as AD drugs.

Previous studies have applied years of life lost (YLL) as a complementary 
indicator to assess the short-term effect of the air pollution on the health 
burden from all-cause mortality, but sparsely focused on individual diseases 
such as acute myocardial infraction (AMI). In this study, we aimed to conduct a 
time-series analysis to evaluate short-term effects of fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5) on mortality and YLL from AMI in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2015, and 
explore the potential effect modifiers including sex and age by subgroup 
analysis. We applied generalized additive Poisson and Gaussian regression model 
for daily death count and YLL, respectively. We found that 10μg/m3 increment in 
concentration of PM2.5 lasting for two days (lag01) was associated with a 2.35% 
(95% CI 0.38% to 4.36%) increase in daily mortality count and a 1.69 (95% CI 
0.01 to 3.37) years increase in YLL from AMI. The association between PM2.5 and 
AMI mortality count was stronger among women and older people than men and young 
people, respectively. We concluded that acute exposure to PM2.5 may increase the 
risk of mortality and YLL from AMI in Hong Kong and this effect can be modified 
by age and gender. These findings add to the evidence base for public health 
policy formulation and resource allocation.

Organised screening for cervical cancer in France: a cost-effectiveness 
assessment.

Boulogne-Billancourt, Île-de-France, France.

OBJECTIVE: According to the third cancer plan, organised screening (OS) of 
cervical cancer (CC) among women aged 25-65 years should be implemented in 
France in the forthcoming years. The most efficient way to implement OS in the 
French healthcare system is yet to be determined.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed adopting a collective 'all 
payers' perspective. A closed cohort of women eligible for CC screening and 
representative in terms of age and participation in individual screening 
(IndScr) by annual Papanicolaou (Pap) testing every 3 years was modelled on a 
lifetime horizon. Different OS strategies, additive to IndScr with a 61.9% 
participation rate based on mailed invitations to non-participant women to 
perform OS were assessed. Similar modalities were applied to OS and IndScr 
participants. Strategies implied different screening tests (Papanicolaou (Pap) 
test, human papillomavirus (HPV) test and p16/Ki67 double staining) and OS 
periodicity.
RESULTS: Compared with IndScr only, all OS strategies were associated with 
decreased cancer incidence/mortality (from 14.2%/13.5% to 22.9%/25.8%). Most 
strategies generated extra costs ranging from €37.9 to €1607 per eligible woman. 
HPV testing every 10 and 5 years were cost saving. HPV tests every 10 and 5 
years were the most efficient strategies, generating more survival at lower 
costs than Pap-based strategies. Compared to IndScr only, an HPV test every 10 
years was cost saving. The most effective strategies were p16/Ki67 as primary or 
HPV positive confirmation tests, with respective incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios of €6 541 250 and €101 391 per life year. Pap-based strategies generated 
intermediary results.
CONCLUSION: OS strategies based on the HPV test appear highly efficient. 
However, our results rely on the assumption that women and practitioners comply 
with the recommended OS periodicities (3, 5, 10 years). Implementing these OS 
modalities will require major adaptations to the current CC screening 
organisation. Pap test-based strategies might be simpler to setup while 
preparing an appropriate implementation of more efficient OS screening 
modalities.

Children and Adolescents.

Research, VU University Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Considering the large economic consequences of severe childhood 
obesity for the society, we aimed to conduct an economic evaluation comparing 
two intensive 1-year lifestyle treatments with varying inpatient periods for 
severely obese children and adolescents with regard to standard deviation score 
BMI (SDS-BMI) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
METHODS: An economic evaluation from a societal perspective accompanying a 
randomized controlled trial with a 24-month follow-up. 80 participants (8-19 
years) with severe obesity were included. Participants received an intensive 
1-year lifestyle treatment with an inpatient period of 2 months (short-stay 
group) or 6 months (long-stay group). Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12 
,and 24 months and included SDS-BMI and QALYs.
RESULTS: SDS-BMI decreased in the first 6 months of treatment, stabilized in the 
second 6 months, and increased during the 2nd year in both groups. After 24 
months, SDS-BMI was similar in both groups, but remained lower than baseline 
values (mean difference -0.24, 95% CI -0.42; -0.06). There was no difference in 
QALYs between the groups after 24 months. For SDS-BMI, the probability of the 
short-stay treatment being cost-effective in comparison with the long-stay 
treatment was 1 at a willingness-to-pay of 0 EUR/unit of effect, which slowly 
decreased to 0.54 for larger willingness-to-pay values.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, the short-stay treatment is 
considered to be more cost-effective from the societal perspective in comparison 
with the long-stay treatment. Future research should provide insight in whether 
the short-stay treatment is cost-effective in comparison with usual care.

Viral infections, including HIV, trigger the production of type I interferons 
(IFNs), which in turn, activate a signalling cascade that ultimately culminates 
with the expression of anti-viral proteins. Mounting evidence suggests that type 
I IFNs, in particular IFN-α, play a pivotal role in limiting acute HIV 
infection. Highly active anti-retroviral treatment reduces viral load and 
increases life expectancy in HIV positive patients; however, it fails to fully 
eliminate latent HIV reservoirs. To revisit HIV as a curable disease, this 
article reviews a body of literature that highlights type I IFNs as mediators in 
the control of HIV infection, with particular focus on the anti-HIV restriction 
factors induced and/or activated by IFN-α. In addition, we discuss the relevance 
of type I IFN treatment in the context of HIV latency reversal, novel 
therapeutic intervention strategies and the potential for full HIV clearance.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, ureter, or renal 
pelvis is a highly aggressive disease with poor outcomes. Even with 
platinum-based chemotherapy, the median overall survival is 15 months and the 
5-year survival is only 15%. The role of metastasectomy in urothelial carcinoma 
is currently undefined.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the use and outcomes of metastasectomy in older patients 
with urothelial carcinoma in a large population-based dataset.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a SEER-Medicare study, and from 
70,648 urothelial carcinoma patients who met inclusion criteria, we identified 
497 patients who had at least 1 metastasectomy during a median follow-up of 40 
months.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary study endpoints were 
metastasectomy use, the length of stay for metastasectomy, complications, and 
overall survival following metastasectomy. Secondary outcomes included 30-day 
mortality and readmission rate following metastasectomy.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We identified 497 patients meeting inclusion criteria 
who had at least 1 metastasectomy during the study period including 24 patients 
who had more than 1 procedure resulting in a total of 523 metastasectomies. The 
median overall survival after the first metastasectomy was 19 months (95% CI: 
15-23; interquartile range: 4-74). In this selected patient population, over a 
third of patients were alive at 3 years. In the 476 patients who had evaluable 
discharge dates, the median length of stay after metastasectomy was 7 days (IQR: 
4-12), and 10% of patients had at least 1 complication within 30 days of 
discharge. Thirty-day mortality after metastasectomy was 10% (n = 53/523) and 
was largely driven by the mortality associated with resections of urothelial 
cancer brain metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: In well-selected patients with urothelial carcinoma with a 
reasonable life expectancy, resection of metastatic lesions is safe and is 
associated with long-term survival and potential cures.

Pollen tube growth and guidance: Occam's razor sharpened on a molecular 
arabinogalactan glycoprotein Rosetta Stone.

Occam's Razor suggests a new model of pollen tube tip growth based on a novel 
Hechtian oscillator that integrates a periplasmic arabinogalactan 
glycoprotein-calcium (AGP-Ca2+ ) capacitor with tip-localized AGPs as the source 
of tip-focussed cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations: Hechtian adhesion between the 
plasma membrane and the cell wall of the growing tip acts as a piconewton force 
transducer that couples the internal stress of a rapidly growing wall to the 
plasma membrane. Such Hechtian transduction opens stretch-activated Ca2+ 
channels and activates H+ -ATPase proton pump efflux that dissociates 
periplasmic AGP-Ca2+ resulting in a Ca2+ influx that activates exocytosis of 
wall precursors. Thus, a highly simplified pectic primary cell wall regulates 
its own synthesis by a Hechtian growth oscillator that regulates overall tip 
growth. By analogy with the three cryptic inscriptions of the classical Rosetta 
Stone, the Hechtian Hypothesis translates classical AGP function as a Ca2+ 
capacitor, pollen tube guide and wall plasticizer into a simple but widely 
applicable model of tip growth. Even wider ramifications of the Hechtian 
oscillator may implicate AGPs in osmosensing or gravisensing and other tropisms, 
leading us yet further towards the Holy Grail of plant growth.

Structural Biology of Proline Catabolic Enzymes.

SIGNIFICANCE: Proline catabolism refers to the 4-electron oxidation of proline 
to glutamate catalyzed by the enzymes proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and 
l-glutamate γ-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GSALDH, or ALDH4A1). These enzymes and 
the intermediate metabolites of the pathway have been implicated in tumor growth 
and suppression, metastasis, hyperprolinemia metabolic disorders, schizophrenia 
susceptibility, life span extension, and pathogen virulence and survival. In 
some bacteria, PRODH and GSALDH are combined into a bifunctional enzyme known as 
proline utilization A (PutA). PutAs are not only virulence factors in some 
pathogenic bacteria but also fascinating systems for studying the coordination 
of metabolic enzymes via substrate channeling. Recent Advances: The past decade 
has seen an explosion of structural data for proline catabolic enzymes. This 
review surveys these structures, emphasizing protein folds, substrate 
recognition, oligomerization, kinetic mechanisms, and substrate channeling in 
PutA.
CRITICAL ISSUES: Major unsolved structural targets include eukaryotic PRODH, the 
complex between monofunctional PRODH and monofunctional GSALDH, and the largest 
of all PutAs, trifunctional PutA. The structural basis of PutA-membrane 
association is poorly understood. Fundamental aspects of substrate channeling in 
PutA remain unknown, such as the identity of the channeled intermediate, how the 
tunnel system is activated, and the roles of ancillary tunnels.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: New approaches are needed to study the molecular and in vivo 
mechanisms of substrate channeling. With the discovery of the proline cycle 
driving tumor growth and metastasis, the development of inhibitors of proline 
metabolic enzymes has emerged as an exciting new direction. Structural biology 
will be important in these endeavors.

OBJECTIVE: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of young onset 
dementia. Very few reports on disease duration are currently available and 
predictors of survival are still undefined. The aim of the present study was to 
assess the natural history of FTD and to define predictors of survival.
METHODS: Four hundred amd eleven FTD patients, including 294 with behavioural 
variant FTD, 77 with agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and 40 
with semantic variant PPA, were consecutively enrolled and demographic and 
clinical variables carefully recorded. Each patient underwent genetic screening 
for monogenic disease.
RESULTS: The mean survival time from onset of the symptoms was 7.8 ± 4.0 years. 
The presence of a pathogenic mutation (GRN, C9orf72 or MAPT) (Hazard ratio 
[HR] = 1.85, 95% CI 1.04-3.31, p = 0.037) and older age at disease onset 
(HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, p = 0.002) were associated with shorter life 
expectancy. However, a significant negative interaction between age at onset and 
genetic mutation was found, suggesting that the effect of age is different in 
patients with and without a genetic mutation (p = 0.028). Gender, clinical 
phenotype or education and occupation were not associated with survival risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that monogenic disease and age at onset are 
independent predictors of survival and should be considered in future clinical 
intervention trials and in patients' and caregivers' counselling.

BACKGROUND: A common feature of most reviews or catalogues of health utilities 
has been their focus on adult health states or derivation of values from adult 
populations. More generally, utility measurement in or on behalf of children has 
been constrained by several methodological concerns. The objective of this study 
was to conduct the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 
primary utility data for childhood conditions and descriptors, and to determine 
the effects of methodological factors on childhood utilities.
METHODS: The review followed PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, 
PsycINFO, EconLit, CINAHL and Cochrane Library were searched for primary studies 
reporting health utilities for childhood conditions or descriptors using direct 
or indirect valuation methods. The Paediatric Economic Database Evaluation 
(PEDE) Porject was also searched for cost-utility analyses with primary utility 
values. Mean or median utilities for each of the main samples were catalogued, 
and weighted averages of utilities for each health condition were estimated, by 
valuation method. Mixed-effects meta-regression using hierarchical linear 
modeling was conducted for the most common valuation methods to estimate the 
utility decrement for each health condition category relative to general 
childhood population health, as well as the independent effects of 
methodological factors.
RESULTS: The literature searches resulted in 272 eligible studies. These yielded 
3,414 utilities when all sub-groups were considered, covering all ICD-10 
chapters relevant to childhood health, 19 valuation methods, 12 respondent 
types, 8 modes of administration, and data from 36 countries. A total of 1,191 
utility values were obtained when only main study samples were considered, and 
these were catalogued by health condition or descriptor, and methodological 
characteristics. 1,073 mean utilities for main samples were used for 
fixed-effects meta-analysis by health condition and valuation method. 
Mixed-effects meta-regressions estimated that 53 of 76 ICD-10 delineated health 
conditions, valued using the HUI3, were associated with statistically 
significant utility decrements relative to general population health, whereas 38 
of 57 valued using a visual analog scale (VAS) were associated with 
statistically significant VAS decrements. For both methods, parental proxy 
assessment was associated with overestimation of values, whereas adolescents 
reported lower values than children under 12 y. VAS responses were more heavily 
influenced by mode of administration than the HUI3.
CONCLUSION: Utilities and their associated distributions, as well as the 
independent contributions of methodological factors, revealed by this systematic 
review and meta-analysis can inform future economic evaluations within the 
childhood context.

INTRODUCTION: Almost 50% of all cancers and 70% of cancer deaths occur in cases 
aged 65 years and more. Thus diagnosis, treatment and follow up in old cases 
gain importance. Since there a limited number of study that show age-mortality 
relation in lung cancer cases aged 80 years and over, issues may arise in 
diagnosis and treatment process of these cases. In this study, we aimed to 
evaluate general characteristics of lung cancer cases aged 80 years or over and 
factors that affect survey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2013, the retrospective cohort study was 
done in Sureyyapasa Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Training and Research 
Hospital and 100 cases of lung carcinoma were examined.
RESULT: In the study, 70% of the cases were male and 30% were female. Median age 
was 83 ± 2.91 (80-92) years. 71% of the cases were found to be suffering from a 
comorbid disease; 29% did not have any comorbid disease. Dyspnea (56%), cough 
(50%) and chest pain (41%) were the most frequent symptoms. Histopathologically, 
41% of the patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and 40% were diagnosed with 
squamous cell carcinoma. Median survival time was 2.73 months (%95 CI 0.96-4.49) 
and 1-year survival rate was 17%. Length of time of the cases with smoking 
history was found shorter than of cases without smoking history (p= 0.013). Life 
expectancy of the cases with advanced disease and performance score of 3-4 was 
detected to be short (p= 0.006, p< 0.001). Compared to the cases who operated on 
and had chemoradiotherapy, length of life who had symptomatic treatment was 
shorter (p< 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the comorbidity in lung cancer cases aged 80 years and 
over, life expectancy of the cases who had surgical and/or chemoradiotherapy 
treatment is longer. While deciding on treatment methods on these cases, 
patient's performance must be taken into consideration.

Temporal regularities can guide our attention to focus on a particular moment in 
time and to be especially vigilant just then. Previous research provided 
evidence for the influence of temporal expectation on perceptual processing in 
unisensory auditory, visual, and tactile contexts. However, in real life we are 
often exposed to a complex and continuous stream of multisensory events. Here we 
tested - in a series of experiments - whether temporal expectations can enhance 
perception in multisensory contexts and whether this enhancement differs from 
enhancements in unisensory contexts. Our discrimination paradigm contained 
near-threshold targets (subject-specific 75% discrimination accuracy) embedded 
in a sequence of distractors. The likelihood of target occurrence (early or 
late) was manipulated block-wise. Furthermore, we tested whether spatial and 
modality-specific target uncertainty (i.e. predictable vs. unpredictable target 
position or modality) would affect temporal expectation (TE) measured with 
perceptual sensitivity (d') and response times (RT). In all our experiments, 
hidden temporal regularities improved performance for expected multisensory 
targets. Moreover, multisensory performance was unaffected by spatial and 
modality-specific uncertainty, whereas unisensory TE effects on d' but not RT 
were modulated by spatial and modality-specific uncertainty. Additionally, the 
size of the temporal expectation effect, i.e. the increase in perceptual 
sensitivity and decrease of RT, scaled linearly with the likelihood of expected 
targets. Finally, temporal expectation effects were unaffected by varying target 
position within the stream. Together, our results strongly suggest that 
participants quickly adapt to novel temporal contexts, that they benefit from 
multisensory (relative to unisensory) stimulation and that multisensory benefits 
are maximal if the stimulus-driven uncertainty is highest. We propose that 
enhanced informational content (i.e. multisensory stimulation) enables the 
robust extraction of temporal regularities which in turn boost (uni-)sensory 
representations.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and TACE in 
combination with sorafenib (TACE-sorafenib) have shown a significant survival 
benefit for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Adopting either as a first-line therapy carries major cost and resource 
implications. The objective of this study was to estimate the relative 
cost-effectiveness of TACE against TACE-sorafenib for unresectable HCC using a 
decision analytic model.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to compare TACE and TACE-sorafenib. 
Transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from systematic literature 
reviews, and costs were obtained from West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 
China. Survival benefits were reported in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. Sensitive 
analysis was performed by varying potentially modifiable parameters of the 
model.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that TACE cost $26 951 and yielded 
survival of 0.71 QALYs, and TACE-sorafenib cost $44 542 and yielded survival of 
1.02 QALYs in the entire treatment. The ICER of TACE-sorafenib versus TACE was 
$56 745 per QALY gained, which was above threshold for cost-effectiveness in 
China. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the major driver of ICER was the cost 
post TACE-sorafenib therapy with stable state.
CONCLUSION: TACE is a more cost-effective strategy than TACE-sorafenib for the 
treatment of unresectable HCC.

BACKGROUND: For the planning of an effective dog mass vaccination campaign 
against rabies in Africa, it is crucial to know more about the dog population. 
In this paper we describe for the first time the dog ecology, demographic 
structure and population dynamics of a domestic dog population in Bamako, Mali. 
In 2010 and 2011, we visited 2956 randomly selected compounds. Questionnaire 
data was collected on the compound and household level and on each dog 
individually. Dog-owning households were followed every six months during one 
(dog-owning households identified in 2011) or two years (dog-owning households 
identified in 2010) for the successive collection of dog demography data.
RESULTS: We recorded 379 dogs in 279 compounds. The dog human ratio was 
estimated at 1:121, and the extrapolation of the domestic dog population in 
Bamako results in an estimate of 14 906 dogs (95% CI 13 041-17 037). The female 
male ratio was 1:2.8. A high proportion of young dogs was found as a result of a 
high turnover rate in the population. Mortality within the first year of life 
was high, and dogs had a life expectancy at birth of 2.5 years. Using a Leslie 
matrix, we estimated the annual dog population growth to be 20%. Christians were 
more likely to be dog owners than Muslims. Another factor favouring dog 
ownership was belonging to the ethnic group of Bobo or Malinke. Dogs were mainly 
used as watchdogs and fed with household leftovers and garbage. They were most 
often obtained and given away without remuneration.
CONCLUSIONS: This work contributes vital information towards planning effective 
and sustainable dog rabies control programmes for the district of Bamako. Due to 
the high turnover rate, we recommend repeated mass-vaccination campaigns of at 
least 70% of the owned dogs at yearly intervals. In addition, dog-owners need to 
be educated on good dog management.

Diagnosis and Management of Noncardiac Complications in Adults With Congenital 
Heart Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.

Lui GK, Saidi A, Bhatt AB, Burchill LJ, Deen JF, Earing MG, Gewitz M, Ginns J, 
Kay JD, Kim YY, Kovacs AH, Krieger EV, Wu FM, Yoo SJ; American Heart Association 
Adult Congenital Heart Disease Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology 
and Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young; Council on Cardiovascular 
Radiology and Intervention; and Council on Quality of Care and Outcomes 
Research.

Life expectancy and quality of life for those born with congenital heart disease 
(CHD) have greatly improved over the past 3 decades. While representing a great 
advance for these patients, who have been able to move from childhood to 
successful adult lives in increasing numbers, this development has resulted in 
an epidemiological shift and a generation of patients who are at risk of 
developing chronic multisystem disease in adulthood. Noncardiac complications 
significantly contribute to the morbidity and mortality of adults with CHD. 
Reduced survival has been documented in patients with CHD with renal 
dysfunction, restrictive lung disease, anemia, and cirrhosis. Furthermore, as 
this population ages, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its risk 
factors are becoming increasingly prevalent. Disorders of psychosocial and 
cognitive development are key factors affecting the quality of life of these 
individuals. It is incumbent on physicians who care for patients with CHD to be 
mindful of the effects that disease of organs other than the heart may have on 
the well-being of adults with CHD. Further research is needed to understand how 
these noncardiac complications may affect the long-term outcome in these 
patients and what modifiable factors can be targeted for preventive 
intervention.

Lifetime quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) prioritarianism has recently been 
defended as a reasonable specification of the prioritarian view that benefits to 
the worse off should be given priority in health-related priority setting. This 
paper argues against this view with reference to how it relies on implausible 
assumptions. By referring to lifetime QALY as the basis for judgments about who 
is worse off lifetime QALY prioritarianism relies on assumptions of strict 
additivity, atomism and intertemporal separability of sublifetime attributes. 
These assumptions entail that a health state at some period in time contributes 
with the same amount to how well off someone is regardless of intrapersonal and 
interpersonal distributions of health states. The paper argues that this is 
implausible and that prioritarians should take both intrapersonal and 
interpersonal distributions of goods into account when they establish who is 
worse off. They should therefore not accept that lifetime QALY is a reasonable 
ground for ascribing priority and reject lifetime QALY prioritarianism.

INTRODUCTION: The primary aim was to investigate the health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) in patients treated for a patella fracture. The explorative aim was 
to report the associations between HRQOL, knee osteoarthritis, muscle strength 
and gait function.
METHODS: The study design was a cohort study. Patients who were treated for 
patella fractures at Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark between January 2006 
and December 2009 were identified. Patients between the age of 18 and 80 were 
included. The main outcome was assessed by the EQ5D-5L questionnaire. 
Classifications by Sperner and Kellgren/Lawrence were applied to evaluate 
osteoarthritis. Moreover, functional outcomes were evaluated by: KOOS, muscle 
strength and gait analysis.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included with a mean follow-up time of 
8.5 years. The mean age was 53.9 years. The mean EQ5D-5L index value was 0.741, 
and was significantly worse compared to a reference population. X-rays taken at 
the time of diagnosis and the time of follow-up showed progression towards a 
higher degree of osteoarthritis in the injured knee for both the patellofemoral 
and tibiofemoral joints. Patients demonstrated significantly lower knee 
extension strength in the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg 
(P = 0.011). No significant difference in gait speed and cadence were observed 
compared to the reference population. Knee osteoarthritis, muscle strength and 
gait patterns were not associated with HRQOL (R < 0.35).
CONCLUSION: At 8.5 years following a patella fracture, HRQOL was significantly 
worse compared to an age-matched reference population.

BACKGROUND: The immunotherapeutic role of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 
life expectancy in many cancers has been highlighted. However, data regarding 
PD-L1 expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are limited. In this 
study, we describe the PD-L1 and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) 
expressions in PTC and analyze their correlation with lymph node (LN) 
metastasis.
METHODS: Clinicopathological data were obtained from 116 patients with PTC who 
were treated in Gyeongsang National University Hospital, Jinju, Korea in 2009. 
Tissue microarray blocks were made using representative paraffin blocks of 
classical PTCs excluding follicular variants. Two pathologists graded the 
proportion and intensity of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in both tumor and 
inflammatory cells. According to their proportions, positive PTC cells were 
scored as negative (0%), grade 1 (1%-50%), and grade 2 (51%-100%). Similarly, 
positive inflammatory cells were graded as negative (0%), grade 1 (1%-10%), and 
grade 2 (11%-20%). The intensity of each protein expression was simplified as 
positive or negative.
RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation exists between the proportions 
of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression both in papillary carcinoma (p=.001) and 
peritumoral lymphoid cells in the thyroid (p<.001). In addition, the proportion 
of PD-L1 expression in PTC cells was closely related to metastatic LNs (p=.036).
CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 is a valuable predictive marker for LN metastasis in PTC. 
Immunomodulating therapies that inhibit PD-L1 might be an option for patients 
with LN metastasis.
