With the rise in wearable technology and "health culture", we are seeing an 
increasing interest and affordances in studying how to not only prolong life 
expectancy but also in how to improve individuals' quality of life. On the one 
hand, this attempts to give meaning to the increasing life expectancy, as living 
above a certain threshold of pain and lack of autonomy or mobility is both 
degrading and unfair. On the other hand, it lowers the cost of continuous care, 
as individuals with high quality of life indexes tend to have lower hospital 
readmissions or secondary complications, not to mention higher physical and 
mental health. In this paper, we evaluate the current state of the art in 
physiological therapy (biofeedback) along with the existing medical grade and 
consumer grade hardware for physiological research. We provide a quick primer on 
the most commonly monitored physiologic metrics, as well as a brief discussion 
on the current state of the art in biofeedback-assisted medical applications. We 
then go on to present a comparative analysis between medical and consumer grade 
biofeedback devices and discuss the hardware specifications and potential 
practical applications of each consumer grade device in terms of functionality 
and adaptability for controlled (laboratory) and uncontrolled (field) studies. 
We end this article with some empirical observations based on our study so that 
readers might use take them into consideration when arranging a laboratory or 
real-world experience, thus avoiding costly time delays and material 
expenditures.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Crohn's disease 
(CD) treatment with vedolizumab and ustekinumab after failure of therapy with 
tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists (anti-TNFs).
METHODS: The Markov model incorporated the lifetime horizon, synthesis-based 
estimates of biologics' efficacy in relation to anti-TNF exposure, and 
administration of biologics reflecting clinical practice (e.g., sequence of 
biologics, retreatment, 12-month treatment). The utilities, non-medical costs 
and indirect costs were derived from a study of 200 adult patients with CD, 
while the healthcare costs were from a study of 1393 adults with CD who used 
biologics in Poland. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (the 
societal perspective) were discounted with the annual rates of 3.5 and 5%, 
respectively.
RESULTS: The addition of vedolizumab (ustekinumab) to the sequence of available 
anti-TNFs (after first-line infliximab or after second-line adalimumab) led to a 
gain of 0.364 (0.349) QALYs at an additional cost of €5600.24 (€6593.82). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were €15,369 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 7496-61,354] and €18,878 (95% CI 9213-85,045) per QALY gained with 
vedolizumab and ustekinumab, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed a high 
impact on the ICERs of the relapse rate after discontinuation of biologic 
treatment. The highest value of vedolizumab/ustekinumab was estimated after the 
failure of therapies with both anti-TNFs.
CONCLUSIONS: CD treatment with ustekinumab or vedolizumab after failure of 
anti-TNF therapy appears to be cost-effective at a threshold of €31,500. The 
replacement of the second-line anti-TNF with ustekinumab/vedolizumab and the 
course of the disease after discontinuation of biologics are influential drivers 
of the cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to evaluate the cost-utility of 
bariatric surgery in England.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed to compare the costs and 
outcomes of two treatment approaches for patients with morbid obesity: bariatric 
surgery, including gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric 
banding; and non-surgical usual care. Parameters of the effectiveness of surgery 
and complications were informed by data from the UK National Bariatric Surgery 
Registry, the Scandinavian Obesity Registry and the Swedish Obese Subjects 
study. Costs and utilities were informed by UK sources.
RESULTS: Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced mean costs to the health 
service by €2742 (£1944), and gain of 0·8 life-years and 4·0 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) over a lifetime compared with usual care. Bariatric surgery 
also had the potential to reduce the lifetime risks of obesity-related 
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Delaying surgery for up to 3 years 
resulted in a reduction of 0·7 QALYs and a minor decrease of €2058 (£1459) in 
associated healthcare costs.
CONCLUSION: Currently used surgical methods were found to be cost saving over 
the lifetime of individuals treated in England.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of suvorexant for the treatment of Japanese elderly 
patients with chronic insomnia in a virtual cohort.

AIMS: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the orexin receptor 
antagonist suvorexant against zolpidem, the most widely used hypnotic 
benzodiazepine receptor agonist in Japan. To this end, a model was used that 
factored in insomnia and the risk for hip fractures, which have devastating 
effects on the elderly.
METHODS: Data were derived from published papers. The target population was a 
virtual cohort of elderly patients (≥65 years) with insomnia residing in Japan. 
Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as effectiveness measures. The 
investigators assumed the perspective of healthcare payers.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, suvorexant was cost-saving (suvorexant: 
$252.3, zolpidem: $328.7) and had higher QALYs gained (suvorexant: 0.0641, 
zolpidem: 0.0635) for elderly Japanese patients with insomnia compared with 
zolpidem, indicating that suvorexant was dominant. In the sensitivity analysis, 
the outcome changed from dominant to dominated due to the relative risk for hip 
fractures associated with suvorexant. However, when the other parameters were 
varied from the lower to the upper limits of their ranges, suvorexant remained 
dominant compared to zolpidem.
LIMITATIONS: The relative risk for hip fractures for suvorexant used in the 
model was based on data from pre-approval clinical trials. More precise data may 
be needed.
CONCLUSIONS: Suvorexant seemed to be more cost-effective than the alternative 
zolpidem. The findings suggested that suvorexant might be a viable alternative 
to zolpidem for elderly patients with insomnia. A sensitivity analysis showed 
that outcome varied depending on the relative risk for hip fractures associated 
with suvorexant. Further investigations may be needed for more precise results.

Telomerase May Paradoxically Accelerate Aging of the DNA Methylome.

Mendelsohn AR(1)(2), Larrick JW(1)(2).

DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks such as the Horvath DNAm clock provide the most 
accurate biological determination of biological age relative to chronological 
age available today. However, there is little correlation between DNAm clocks, 
telomere-based aging clocks, and transcriptomic-based aging clocks. Recently, a 
genome-wide association study identified single-nucleotide polymorphism variants 
of TERT, the gene that encodes telomerase, as accelerating intrinsic aging in 
the Horvath DNAm clock. These same variants have been previously associated with 
long telomeres in leukocytes, suggesting that TERT acts paradoxically on 
telomere-associated aging and DNAm-associated aging. In dividing fibroblasts, 
ectopic expression of TERT accelerated the Horvath intrinsic DNAm clock. 
However, it is little appreciated that TERT may be expressed at low levels 
transiently in somatic cells and may play a role in chromatin maintenance and 
DNA repair. We hypothesize that TERT may interfere with the maintenance of 
patterns of DNA methylation in proliferating cells, perhaps by altering 
regulators of DNA repair and maintenance of chromatin. The implications of these 
findings for life span extension and the development of antiaging therapeutics 
are profound.

Health-adjusted life expectancy in Canada.

BACKGROUND: Over the past century, life expectancy at birth in Canada has risen 
substantially. However, these gains in the quantity of life say little about 
gains in the quality of life.
DATA AND METHODS: Health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), an indicator of 
quality of life, was estimated for the household and institutional populations 
combined every four years from 1994/1995 to 2015. Health status was measured by 
the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 instrument in two national population health 
surveys, and was used to adjust life expectancy. The percentage of the 
population living in health-related institutions was estimated based on the 
Census of Population. Attribute-deleted HALE was calculated to determine how 
various aspects of health status contributed to the differences between life 
expectancy and HALE.
RESULTS: HALE has increased in Canada. Greater gains among males have narrowed 
the gap between males and females. The ratio of HALE to life expectancy changed 
little for males, and a marginal improvement was observed for females aged 65 or 
older. Mobility problems and pain, the latter mainly among females, accounted 
for an increased share of the burden of ill health over time. Exclusion of the 
institutional population significantly increased the estimates of HALE and 
yielded higher ratios of HALE to life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: Although people are living longer, the share of years spent in good 
functional health has remained fairly constant. Data for both the household and 
institutional populations are necessary for a complete picture of health 
expectancy in Canada.

Norway.

BACKGROUND: The 5-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) was introduced as an 
improvement on the original 3-level version (EQ-5D-3L). To date, 6 
country-specific value sets have been published for EQ-5D-5L and 9 US value sets 
have been published for other instruments. Our aims were to (1) produce EQ-5D-5L 
values on a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scale from the perspective of US 
adults and (2) compare them with US EQ-5D-3L values and the other 
country-specific EQ-5D-5L values.
METHODS: In 2016, 8222 US respondents from all 50 states and Washington, DC 
completed an online survey including a discrete choice experiment with 20 paired 
comparisons. Each comparison asked respondents, "Which do you prefer?" regarding 
a pair of alternatives described using EQ-5D-5L and lifespan attributes. On the 
basis of more than 50 choices on each of the 3160 pairs, we estimated EQ-5D-5L 
values on a QALY scale and compared them with the US EQ-5D-3L values and the 
other country-specific EQ-5D-5L values.
RESULTS: Ranging from -0.287 (55555) to 0.992 (11121) on a QALY scale, the 
estimated EQ-5D-5L values were similar to the US EQ-5D-3L values. Compared with 
the US EQ-5D-3L values, the values exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity 
and higher correlation with the EQ-5D-5L values of other countries, particularly 
England.
CONCLUSIONS: Like previous US valuation studies, this study produced nationally 
representative EQ-5D-5L values on a QALY scale. The results further demonstrate 
the advantages of the EQ-5D-5L over its 3-level predecessor as a 
preference-based summary measure of health-related quality of life from the 
perspective of US adults.

Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: A Role of Laparoscopy in Surgical 
Treatment: Review.

Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are extremely rare neoplasms of the 
pancreas. They originate from pancreatic islet cells, and from the very 
beginning, cancer cells may or may not show hormone hypersecretion. Currently, 
surgical treatment is the only therapeutic method that significantly prolongs 
life expectancy, and in such cases it is a method of choice. In the paper, a 
review of literature based on the Medline database and including mainly the 
period of 2013 to 2017 was performed. In each case an operating surgeon is 
responsible for selection of a method used for surgical treatment. There is no 
unanimous consensus with regard to selection of a surgical method. With regard 
to surgeries performed in PNEN cases a laparoscopic approach can be used in 
almost all procedures to treat PNENs. The analysis of oncological outcomes of 
resection surgeries is still incomplete, but a video approach has a strong 
position in PNEN surgery, and according to current knowledge its therapeutic 
effects are equivalent to those of traditional surgery, and it offers general 
benefits associated with a minimally invasive approach.

OBJECTIVES: This article provides the first estimates of educational differences 
in age-specific prevalence, and changes in prevalence over time, of dementia by 
education levels in the United States. It also provides information on life 
expectancy, and changes in life expectancy, with dementia and cognitively 
healthy life for educational groups.
METHOD: Data on cognition from the 2000 and 2010 Health and Retirement Study are 
used to classify respondents as having dementia, cognitive impairment without 
dementia (CIND), or being cognitively intact. Vital statistics data are used to 
estimate life tables for education groups and the Sullivan method is used to 
estimate life expectancy by cognitive state.
RESULTS: People with more education have lower prevalence of dementia, more 
years of cognitively healthy life, and fewer years with dementia. Years spent in 
good cognition increased for most sex-education groups and, conversely, years 
spent with dementia decreased for some. Mortality reduction was the most 
important factor in increasing cognitively healthy life. Change in the 
distribution of educational attainment has played a major role in the reduction 
of life with dementia in the overall population.
DISCUSSION: Differences in the burden of cognitive loss by education point to 
the significant cost of low social status both to individuals and to society.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed potential benefits for older Americans of reducing risk 
factors associated with dementia.
METHODS: A dynamic simulation model tracked a national cohort of persons 51 and 
52 years of age to project dementia onset and mortality in risk reduction 
scenarios for diabetes, hypertension, and dementia.
RESULTS: We found reducing incidence of diabetes by 50% did not reduce number of 
years a person ages 51 or 52 lived with dementia and increased the population 
ages 65 and older in 2040 with dementia by about 115,000. Eliminating 
hypertension at middle and older ages increased life expectancy conditional on 
survival to age 65 by almost 1 year, however, it increased years living with 
dementia. Innovation in treatments that delay onset of dementia by 2 years 
increased longevity, reduced years with dementia, and decreased the population 
ages 65 and older in 2040 with dementia by 2.2 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of chronic disease may generate health and longevity 
benefits but does not reduce burden of dementia. A focus on treatments that 
provide even short delays in onset of dementia can have immediate impacts on 
longevity and quality of life and reduce the number of Americans with dementia 
over the next decades.

Multiple population based analyses have demonstrated a high incidence of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in subjects with 
T2DM that reduces life expectancy by as much as 15 years. Importantly, the CV 
system is particularly sensitive to the metabolic and immune derangements 
present in obese pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals; consequently, CV 
dysfunction is often the initial CV derangement to occur and promotes the 
progression to end organ/tissue damage in T2DM. Specifically, diabetic CVD can 
manifest as microvascular complications, such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and 
neuropathy, as well as, macrovascular impairments, including ischemic heart 
disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Despite some 
progress in prevention and treatment of CVD, mainly via blood pressure and 
dyslipidemia control strategies, the impact of metabolic disease on CV outcomes 
is still a major challenge and persists in proportion to the epidemics of 
obesity and diabetes. There is abundant pre-clinical and clinical evidence 
implicating the DPP-4-incretin axis in CVD. In this regard, linagliptin is a 
unique DPP-4 inhibitor with both CV and renal safety profiles. Moreover, it 
exerts beneficial CV effects beyond glycemic control and beyond class effects. 
Linagliptin is protective for both macrovascular and microvascular complications 
of diabetes in preclinical models, as well as clinical models. Given the role of 
endothelial-immune cell interactions as one of the key events in the initiation 
and progression of CVD, linagliptin modulates these cell-cell interactions by 
affecting two important pathways involving stimulation of NO signaling and 
potent inhibition of a key immunoregulatory molecule.

BACKGROUND: Electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) approaches 
to address low physical activity levels, sedentary behavior, and unhealthy diets 
have received significant research attention. However, attempts to 
systematically map the entirety of the research field are lacking. This gap can 
be filled with a bibliometric study, where publication-specific data such as 
citations, journals, authors, and keywords are used to provide a systematic 
overview of a specific field. Such analyses will help researchers better 
position their work.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to use bibliometric data to provide 
an overview of the eHealth and mHealth research field related to physical 
activity, sedentary behavior, and diet.
METHODS: The Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was searched to retrieve all 
existing and highly cited (as defined by WoS) physical activity, sedentary 
behavior, and diet related eHealth and mHealth research papers published in 
English between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. Retrieved titles were 
screened for eligibility, using the abstract and full-text where needed. We 
described publication trends over time, which included journals, authors, and 
countries of eligible papers, as well as their keywords and subject categories. 
Citations of eligible papers were compared with those expected based on 
published data. Additionally, we described highly-cited papers of the field (ie, 
top ranked 1%).
RESULTS: The search identified 4805 hits, of which 1712 (including 42 
highly-cited papers) were included in the analyses. Publication output increased 
on an average of 26% per year since 2000, with 49.00% (839/1712) of papers being 
published between 2014 and 2016. Overall and throughout the years, eHealth and 
mHealth papers related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet 
received more citations than expected compared with papers in the same WoS 
subject categories. The Journal of Medical Internet Research published most 
papers in the field (9.58%, 164/1712). Most papers originated from high-income 
countries (96.90%, 1659/1717), in particular the United States (48.83%, 
836/1712). Most papers were trials and studied physical activity. Beginning in 
2013, research on Generation 2 technologies (eg, smartphones, wearables) sharply 
increased, while research on Generation 1 (eg, text messages) technologies 
increased at a reduced pace. Reviews accounted for 20 of the 42 highly-cited 
papers (n=19 systematic reviews). Social media, smartphone apps, and wearable 
activity trackers used to encourage physical activity, less sedentary behavior, 
and/or healthy eating were the focus of 14 highly-cited papers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the rapid growth of the eHealth and mHealth 
physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet research field, emphasized the 
sizeable contribution of research from high-income countries, and pointed to the 
increased research interest in Generation 2 technologies. It is expected that 
the field will grow and diversify further and that reviews and research on most 
recent technologies will continue to strongly impact the field.

In Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples bear a greater 
burden of disease and have lower life expectancy than their non-Indigenous 
counterparts. These combined indicators are evidence of an entrenched health 
crisis in the Indigenous population that is linked to systemic disadvantage over 
many decades. In an effort to improve life expectancy and lessen the burden of 
disease, a number of strategies and national frameworks now embed a human 
rights-based approach to achieving health equality. This paper explores the 
application of human rights to Indigenous health and examines the inherent 
tensions that exist in engaging a system of law based on universal assumptions 
of the Enlightenment to advance Indigenous rights. What becomes apparent through 
this exploration is that the strategic approach of Indigenous peoples&rsquo; use 
of human rights, despite its genesis in a system of law that justified 
colonisation, has opened up opportunities to reframe fixed ideas of law and 
culture.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) dual 
bronchodilator indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) as a maintenance treatment 
for COPD patients from the perspective of health care payer in Taiwan.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We adopted a patient-level simulation model, which 
included a cohort of COPD patients aged ≥40 years. The intervention used in the 
study was the treatment using IND/GLY, and comparators were tiotropium or 
salmeterol/fluticasone combination (SFC). Data related to the efficacy of drugs, 
incidence of exacerbation, and utility were obtained from clinical studies. 
Direct costs were estimated from claims data based on the severity of COPD. The 
cycle length was 6 months (to match forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] 
data), and the time horizons included 1, 3, 5, 10 years, and lifetime. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the 
robustness of the model results. Costs were expressed in US dollars with a 
discount rate of 3.0%.
RESULTS: Compared to tiotropium and SFC, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of patients treated 
with IND/GLY were US$5,987 and US$14,990, respectively. One-way sensitivity 
analysis revealed that the improvement in FEV1 provided by IND/GLY, the 
distribution of patients with regard to the severity of COPD, and acute 
exacerbation rate ratio were the key drivers behind cost-effectiveness. Adopting 
a willingness to pay of US$60,000 per QALY gained as the threshold, there was a 
98.7% probability that IND/GLY was cost-effective compared to tiotropium. 
Similarly, there was a 99.9% probability that IND/GLY was cost-effective 
compared to SFC.
CONCLUSION: As a maintenance treatment for COPD, we consider the dual 
bronchodilator IND/GLY as a cost-effective strategy when compared to either 
tiotropium or SFC.

Cancers of unknown primary (CUP) are histologically proven metastatic malignant 
tumors without an identified primary site before treatment. The common 
characteristics are early dissemination, lower response to chemotherapy and poor 
prognosis with short life expectancy. Treatment was directed according to the 
presence of localized or disseminated disease. The most frequent site of 
metastasis is the liver, which is a suitable target organ for arterial-directed 
therapies. We report a case of 53-year-old woman who was diagnosed with CUP and 
suspected with intracellular cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC), presented with a 
very large, unresectable, chemotherapy-refractory hepatic mass and treated with 
transarterial chemoembolization and transarterial radioembolization and 
surprisingly followed for 48 months with minimally progressive and stable 
disease. Arterial-directed therapies, an important therapeutic option in 
unresectable liver tumors, can provide survival benefit even for ICC and CUP 
which are very large in size.

[Coronary artery disease in women – how to prevent heart failure after 
myocardial infarction?].

[Article in Polish]

Kornacewicz-Jach Z.

Cardiovascular disease has been the most common cause of death and disability in 
women. The prevelence of cardiovascular diseases in women increases dramatically 
with age as the population ages and women’s life expectancy inareases. Compared 
with men, women with coronary artery diseases are older and more likely to have 
hyprtension, diabetes and congestive heart failure. Principles of diagnostic and 
therapeutic management of women are similar to those in men. Clinical trials 
focusing on treatment alternatives in women have demonstrated improvements in 
outcomes with advances in technologies and contemporary therapies. All efforts 
should be focused on the proper screening, prevention and referral for treatment 
of women with coronary artery disease in order to impact the increasing 
mortality from heart failure.

[Heart failure in elderly women. How to treat?].

[Article in Polish]

Chomik S, Hoffman P.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in developed 
countries. Almost one-third of cardiovascular deaths are related to heart 
failure (HF). The prevalence of HF increases dynamically with advancing age, 
from 1% among population of 50 years of age to over 10% among individuals of 
70-80 years or older. Women already represent the majority of HF patients and 
taking into consideration their longer life expectancy compared to men 
population, these proportions are likely to grow further. From the other hand 
this dominant position of women in the HF segment is under- -recognized and 
under-represented in clinical studies. Elderly women with HF are frequently 
excluded from clinical trials because of their relatively higher comorbidity 
compared to men population thus substantial uncertainty remains regarding 
efficacy and safety of HF treatment in this population.

Lifespan varies dramatically among species, but the biological basis is not well 
understood. Previous studies in model organisms revealed the importance of 
nutrient sensing, mTOR, NAD/sirtuins, and insulin/IGF1 signaling in lifespan 
control. By studying life-history traits and transcriptomes of 14 Drosophila 
species differing more than sixfold in lifespan, we explored expression 
divergence and identified genes and processes that correlate with longevity. 
These longevity signatures suggested that longer-lived flies upregulate fatty 
acid metabolism, downregulate neuronal system development and activin signaling, 
and alter dynamics of RNA splicing. Interestingly, these gene expression 
patterns resembled those of flies under dietary restriction and several other 
lifespan-extending interventions, although on the individual gene level, there 
was no significant overlap with genes previously reported to have 
lifespan-extension effects. We experimentally tested the lifespan regulation 
potential of several candidate genes and found no consistent effects, suggesting 
that individual genes generally do not explain the observed longevity patterns. 
Instead, it appears that lifespan regulation across species is modulated by 
complex relationships at the system level represented by global gene expression.

A range of nonthermal techniques have demonstrated process efficacy in ensuring 
product safety, extension of shelf life, and in general a retention of key 
quality attributes. However, various physical, chemical and biochemical effects 
of nonthermal techniques on macro and micro nutrients are evident, leading to 
both desirable and undesirable changes in food products. The objective of this 
review is to outline the effects of nonthermal techniques on food chemistry and 
the associated degradation mechanisms with the treatment of foods. Oxidation is 
one of the key mechanisms responsible for undesirable effects induced by 
nonthermal techniques. Degradation of key macromolecules largely depends on the 
processing conditions employed. Various extrinsic and intrinsic control 
parameters of high-pressure processing, pulsed electric field, ultrasound 
processing, and cold atmospheric plasma on chemistry of processed food are 
outlined. Proposed mechanisms and associated degradation of macromolecules, 
i.e., proteins, lipids, and bioactive molecules resulting in food quality 
changes are also discussed.

The search for new chemotherapeutics unaffected by efflux pumps would 
significantly increase life expectancy in patients with malignant cancers. In 
this study, butylcycloheptylprodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin were 
HPLC-purified and verified, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Cell 
cytotoxicity and transportation kinetics on multiple-drug resistance (MDR) cells 
were evaluated. Daunorubicin and butylcycloheptylprodigiosin were less toxic in 
the MDR1 overexpressing line, but undecylprodigiosin revealed potent toxicity 
toward MDR1 and BCRP expressing malignant cells. There was no noticeable change 
in MDR1 and BCRP transcripts during 3 days of treatment with prodiginines. While 
daunorubicin and mitoxantrone uptake from the cell environment significantly 
decreased with increasing multidrug resistance up to 46% and 62%, respectively, 
the accumulation of undecylprodigiosin and to a lesser extent 
butylcycloheptylprodigiosin in the resistance cells occurred cell- and 
dose-dependently via a passive diffusion process and were almost equally 
sensitive to the parent lines. The efflux of xenobiotics commenced immediately 
with different kinetics in various cells. A greater amount of daunorubicin and 
mitoxantrone were rapidly thrown out of their corresponding MDR cells in the 
absence of the specific inhibitor (3.01 and 1.81 dF/min, respectively) and 
represented functional efflux pumps. MDR pumps did not apparently influence 
undecylprodigiosin efflux patterns; but butylcycloheptylprodigiosin was 
partially removed from EPG85.257RDB cells at the rate of 2.66 and 1.41 dF/min in 
the absence and presence of verapamil, respectively.

Dejoy, Dr Wilson); Terry College of Business (Dr Vandenberg), University of 
Georgia, Athens, Georgia.

OBJECTIVE: Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the Fuel Your Life (FYL) 
program dissemination.
METHODS: Employees were recruited from three workplaces randomly assigned to one 
of the conditions: telephone coaching, small group coaching, and self-study. 
Costs were collected prospectively during the efficacy trial. The main outcome 
measures of interest were weight loss and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The phone condition was most costly ($601 to $589/employee) and the 
self-study condition was least costly ($145 to $143/employee). For weight loss, 
delivering FYL through the small group condition was no more effective, yet more 
expensive, than the self-study delivery. For QALYs, the group delivery of FYL 
was in an acceptable cost-effectiveness range ($22,400/QALY) relative to 
self-study (95% confidence interval [CI]: $10,600/QALY-dominated).
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention programs require adaptation at the local level and 
significantly affect the cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the 
program.
