The insecticidal activity of phosphine (PH3) and ethyl formate (EF) toward 
Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and their 
phytotoxicity to asparagus were evaluated. Both the PH3 and EF fumigants showed 
higher lethal concentration and time (LCT) values at lower temperatures. The 
LCT99 values of PH3 and EF at 5°C in a 12 liters desiccator for 4 h showed the 
following ranking: eggs (64.69 mg·h/liter for PH3 and EF indicating 
phytotoxicity to asparagus), nymphs (5.54 and 17.48 mg·h/liter, respectively), 
and adults (3.83 and 14.67 mg·h/liter, respectively). The adsorption of PH3 was 
approximately 11% at 2°C and 13% at 5°C, whereas the adsorption of EF increased 
sharply to 88% at 2°C and 97% at 5°C. The hatching rate of F. occidentalis eggs 
was approximately 95% at all locations (top, middle, and bottom) in the presence 
of 4 mg/liter PH3 at 5°C in a 0.65-m3 fumigation chamber for 24 h. However, 
extension of the treatment to 48 h resulted in 100% inhibition of egg hatching. 
The atmospheric level of PH3 decreased below the threshold limit value after 80 
min, and phytotoxicity was not observed. The results revealed that EF is highly 
absorbed by asparagus and is not suitable as a fumigant, but PH3 is a suitable 
alternative to the fumigant methyl bromide for the control of western flower 
thrips in asparagus.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prior studies examining depression among older 
Mexican Americans suggest both women and immigrants are at higher risk of 
depressive symptomatology than males and U.S.-born Mexican Americans. We use 
data from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of 
the Elderly to examine whether life expectancy with depression and without 
depression varies by nativity, age of migration, and gender.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sullivan-based life tables were used to estimate 
depression life expectancies among Mexican Americans aged 65 years and older 
residing in the Southwestern United States. Depression is based on the 20-item 
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a 
continuous scale (0-60) with higher values indicating worse mental health. We 
dichotomize depression as a score of 16 or greater.
RESULTS: Immigrant women, particularly those who migrated in late-life (after 
age 50) are at a significant disadvantage in the number of years after age 65 
lived with depression and the ratio of years spent without depression relative 
to U.S.-born women. Among men, only late-life immigrants were disadvantaged in 
the number of years spent with depression. Early- and mid-life immigrant males 
did not differ from U.S.-born males.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results highlight the heterogeneity among older 
Mexican Americans in life expectancies with depression. These findings 
illustrate the importance of considering age of migration as a high-risk factor 
for depression among Mexican-origin immigrants. Including this risk factor as a 
part of depression screening is a key step for timely interventions in 
preventing disability and comorbidities associated with untreated depression.

Ocular cancers are unique among the diseases of the eye, threatening both vision 
and life. In most cases, the diagnosis can be made utilizing a careful clinical 
history and specialized ocular examination. Eye cancer diagnosis relies heavily 
on imaging techniques such as high-frequency ultrasound, fluorescein 
angiography, anterior and posterior segment optical coherence tomography, 
computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Once the 
diagnosis is established, treatment decisions depend on the tumor's location, 
size, local extension, patterns of growth, and secondary complications. 
Treatment options include observation, local resection, chemotherapy (topical, 
intravenous, intra-arterial, or intravitreal), and radiation (ophthalmic plaque 
or external beam). Enucleation or exenteration is only employed if these eye- 
and vision-sparing treatments are not possible. The core of this comprehensive 
review is a consecutive series of the most common ocular tumor of each structure 
of the eye, anterior to posterior, including basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid, 
squamous conjunctival neoplasia, choroidal melanoma, retinoblastoma, ocular 
adnexal lymphoma, and metastatic orbital tumors.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will highlight our current understanding of 
age-related changes in bladder function and propose important clinical 
considerations in the management of overactive bladder (OAB) specific to older 
women.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty, functional and cognitive impairment, multimorbidity, 
polypharmacy, estrogen deficiency, and remaining life expectancy are important 
clinical factors to consider and may impact OAB symptom management in older 
women. Third-line therapies, particularly PTNS, may be preferable over 
second-line therapy in some cases. Due to the complexity within this population, 
the standard treatment algorithms may not be applicable, thus a broader, more 
holistic focus is recommended when managing OAB in older women.

Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) regulates the transcription of many genes 
related to cell and organism survival processes such as stress and immune 
response, regulation of cellular senesce, and carcinogenesis. In this study, our 
aim was to investigate the effect of USF1 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) on 
longevity in the Vitality 90+ study, a population-based study of nonagenarians 
(90 ±1 years of age) living in the area of Tampere municipality, Finland. 
Altogether 509 voluntary nonagenarians (115 males, 394 females) were genotyped 
using the 5'-nuclease assay for rs2774279G > A, rs2516839T > C, and 
rs2073658C > T SNVs. During the 4 years of follow-up, the total mortality rate 
was 64.2%. In the study, we found that the frequency of C-allele of rs2516839 
among nonsurviving nonagenarians (52.5%) was higher than those who survived 
(41.2%; P = 0.0006, odds ratio = 1.575, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.215-2.041). Furthermore, carriage of this variation and its haplotypes had a 
significant gender by genotype interaction (P < 0.05) on mortality. Kaplan-Meier 
log-rank test during 4-years of follow-up showed significantly higher mortality 
rate in the case of CC genotype carriage than other genotype carriages in 
nonagenarian women (P < 0.0001). In addition, after adjusting for age in Cox 
regression analysis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infectious disease, 
dementia, and living place (nursing home or home), CC genotype of rs2516839T > C 
was found to be associated with shorter life expectancy in nonagenarian women 
(hazard ratio = 2.27; 95% CI, 1.34-3.85 P = 0.002). In conclusion, rs2516839 
variation and related haplotypes of the USF1 gene are strongly related to 
all-cause mortality in Finnish nonagenarians, especially among women.

Histology of dental long-period biorhythms in Canis familiaris.

Myers, FL, USA.

Our objective is to assess variation in Havers-Halberg oscillation (HHO) 
periodicities among domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). The HHO is hypothesized to 
be a hypothalamic-generated biorhythm coordinating multiple life history 
variables including body mass and lifespan. Dogs have a broad mass range 
spanning two orders of magnitude, but this variation has been shown to result 
from selection on very few genetic loci, and dogs have low variation in other 
life history traits. Therefore, we predict that HHO variation will not be 
correlated to body mass among domestic dogs, as it is in anthropoid primates. To 
test the prediction, we examined dog HHO periodicity via manifestations in tooth 
enamel and dentine, quantifying HHO rhythm histologically. HHO rhythm is 
reflected in teeth as the number of days between secretion of successive striae 
of Retzius (enamel) and Andresen lines (dentine), a value referred to as Retzius 
periodicity (RP). We counted ca. 24-h growth lines between successive Retzius 
and Andresen lines to determine RP in histological thin-sections from canine 
teeth of 19 dogs, representing different breeds and sizes. To test our 
hypothesis, we regressed RP periodicity against body mass data. Dogs have low RP 
variation for their body mass range, with a modal periodicity of 5 days and a 
range of 4-6 days. RP was not significantly correlated with body mass. We 
conclude that mass variation in dogs does not seem driven by HHO physiology, 
consistent with findings that IGF1 variants produce dog mass variation. However, 
low RP (and by extension HHO) variation is consistent with low variation in dog 
lifespan and gestation, suggesting that dog life history may still be governed 
by HHO mechanisms even if body mass does not reflect this.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the methods of treatment of thoracic part 
of esophageal cancer and to predict the results of treatment depending on the 
factors of the prognosis. The results of treatment of 366 patients with cancer 
of the thoracic part of esophagus for 10 years (2007-2016) on the basis of the 
department of thoracic oncology of the Karaganda oncological dispensary were 
studied. The overall five-year survival rate, regardless of the method of 
treatment, was only 8.72% (28 of 321), and in the 6-10 year period 8.41% (27 of 
321) lived, p <0.05. Analysis of the overall survival of patients with cancer of 
the thoracic part of esophagus showed that the method of treatment does not have 
a significant effect on life expectancy. A multivariate analysis of 19 grades 
that affect the prognosis of the disease was carried out. Radical type of 
treatment of the middle and lower thoracic esophagus is surgical, in which the 
median of cumulative survival is 19 months. Traditional radiotherapy should be 
used in a limited way, as it is palliative, with a median survival of no more 
than 9 months. The leading factor in the prognosis for thoracic part of 
esophageal cancer is the presence of regional metastases, on which the choice of 
method of treatment depends.

Tissue engineering is a very promising field of regenerative medicine. Life 
expectancy has been increasing, and tissue replacement is increasingly needed in 
patients suffering from various degenerative disorders of the organs. The use of 
adult mesenchymal stem cells (e.g. from adipose tissue or from bone marrow) in 
tissue engineering seems to be a promising approach for tissue replacements. 
Clinical applications can make direct use of the large secretome of these cells, 
which can have a positive influence on other cells around. Another advantage of 
adult mesenchymal stem cells is the possibility to differentiate them into 
various mature cells via appropriate culture conditions (i.e. medium 
composition, biomaterial properties, and dynamic conditions). This review is 
focused on current and future ways to carry out tissue replacement of damaged 
bones and blood vessels, especially with the use of suitable adult mesenchymal 
stem cells as a potential source of differentiated mature cells that can later 
be used for tissue replacement. The advantages and disadvantages of different 
stem cell sources are discussed, with a main focus on adipose-derived stem 
cells. Patient factors that can influence later clinical applications are taken 
into account.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition after hip fracture is associated with increased 
rehabilitation time, complications, and mortality. We assessed the effect of 
intensive 3 month nutritional intervention in elderly after hip fracture on 
length of stay (LOS).
METHODS: Open-label, randomized controlled trial. Exclusion criteria: age < 55 
years, bone disease, life expectancy < 1 year, bedridden, using oral nutritional 
supplements (ONS) before hospitalization, and cognitive impairment. 
Intervention: weekly dietetic consultation, energy-protein-enriched diet, and 
ONS (400 mL per day) for 3 months. Control: usual nutritional care. Primary 
outcome: total LOS in hospital and rehabilitation clinic, including readmissions 
over 6 months (Cox regression adjusted for confounders); hazard ratio (HR) < 1.0 
reflects longer LOS in the intervention group. Secondary outcomes: nutritional 
and functional status, cognition, quality of life, postoperative complications 
(6 months); subsequent fractures and all-cause mortality (1 and 5 years). Effect 
modification by baseline nutritional status was also tested.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients were randomized (73 intervention, 79 
control). Median total LOS was 34.0 days (range 4-185 days) in the intervention 
group versus control 35.5 days (3-183 days; plogrank = .80; adjusted hazard 
ratio (adjHR): 0.98; 95% CI: 0.68-1.41). Hospital LOS: 12.0 days (4-56 days) 
versus 11.0 days (3-115 days; p = .19; adjHR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.53-1.06) and LOS 
in rehabilitation clinics: 19.5 days (0-174 days) versus 18.5 days (0-168 days; 
p = .82; adjHR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.73-1.48). The intervention improved nutritional 
intake/status at 3, but not at 6 months, and did not affect any other outcome. 
No difference in intervention effect between malnourished and well-nourished 
patients was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive nutritional intervention after hip fracture improved 
nutritional intake and status, but not LOS or clinical outcomes. Paradigms 
underlying nutritional intervention in elderly after hip fracture may have to be 
reconsidered.

Slim bearings are used widely in aircrafts, robots, wind turbines, and 
industrial machineries, where their size and weight are very important for the 
performance of a system. The common materials of slim bearings for robots and 
industrial machineries are based on SAE52110 bearing steel, and special heat 
treatment and a super polishing process are used and adapted to improve the 
rolling contact fatigue (RCF) strength of bearings. The improvement in RCF 
strength, depending on contact stress, surface hardness, and the friction 
behavior before and after ultrasonic nanocrystalline surface modification (UNSM) 
treatment was validated. Simple analysis shows that these improvements can 
reduce the size and weight of slim bearings down to about 3.40⁻21.25% and 
14.3⁻26.05%, respectively. Hence, this UNSM technology is an opportunity to 
implement cost-saving and energy consuming super-polishing, a heat treatment 
process, and to reduce the size and weight of slim bearings.

The expanding role of radiation therapy for thymic malignancies.

Willmann J(1), Rimner A(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New 
York, NY, USA.

The role of radiation therapy (RT) in thymic malignancies has long been subject 
to considerable controversy. The main role for RT is in the setting of adjuvant 
therapy after surgical tumor resection, especially in advanced or incompletely 
resected cases. However, recent studies with larger patient numbers and cleaner 
study populations than previous studies have indicated a potentially clearer 
than previously assumed benefit after post-operative RT (PORT) even for 
completely resected patients with earlier stages of thymoma. In marginally 
resectable patients RT may be used in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
to shrink tumors and thereby potentially enable resection. In unresectable 
patients concurrent or sequential chemotherapy and RT can be employed as the 
definitive nonsurgical approach. The tendency of thymic tumors to recur in the 
pleural space highlights the necessity for more effective approaches to identify 
and treat high risk patients. Experiences in other pleural malignancies may pave 
the way to novel treatment modalities, for example pleural IMRT. The role of 
these techniques in thymic malignancies has yet to be determined and is not 
advisable at the current time outside of a clinical study. As the disease often 
takes an indolent course with excellent long-term local control (LC) and 
survival, late toxicities related to radiation of the mediastinum and adjacent 
organs at risk (OARs) have to be taken into consideration and may jeopardize the 
benefit patients experience from RT, especially in younger patients with a 
long-anticipated life expectancy. Radiation techniques, such as intensity 
modulated RT (IMRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT), have substantially reduced 
the exposure of OARs to ionizing radiation which is expected to translate into 
reduced long-term toxicities. Hence, the risk-benefit ratio of RT in early stage 
thymoma patients may be shifted favorably.

OBJECTIVE: In China, cognitive impairment has become a huge challenge owing to 
the rapid aging process. We investigate cognitive health expectancy and 
potential factors leading to inequalities of cognitive health for Chinese older 
people.
METHODS: The study included 19 943 participants aged 65 to 95 at the first 
observation in Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey collected during 
2002-2014. Cognitive impairment was categorized into none, mild, and severe by 
the score of cMMSE. Multistate models based on continuous-time Markov process 
were applied to calculate cognitive health expectancies and estimate hazard 
ratio from no impairment to impairment for potential factors.
RESULTS: Urban women and men aged 65 were expected to spend 31.18% and 19.82% of 
their remaining 17.46 and 15.45 years with cognitive impairment; meanwhile, 
rural women and men aged 65 were expected to spend 35.31% and 21.39% of their 
remaining 16.73 and 14.87 years with cognitive impairment. Women achieving lower 
educational attainment (HR1-6 years  = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.71-0.87; HR7+ years 
 = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.49-0.70) than men and rural residents having less access to 
medical service (HR = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.68-0.92) and doing less regular exercise 
(HR = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.80-0.96) than urban people caused the differences of 
cognitive health for genders and regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Women and rural people experience less cognitive health 
expectancies compared with their counterparts, respectively. Chinese government 
should pay more attention to rural women and make efforts to reduce the 
inequalities of cognitive health by increasing opportunities of education for 
women and improving access to medical service and healthy lifestyle for rural 
people.

Although personalization of cancer care is recommended, current follow-up after 
the curative treatment of breast cancer is consensus-based and not 
differentiated for base-line risk. Every patient receives annual follow-up for 
5 years without taking into account the individual risk of recurrence. The aim 
of this study was to introduce personalized follow-up schemes by stratifying for 
age. Using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry of 37 230 patients with 
early breast cancer between 2003 and 2006, the risk of recurrence was determined 
for four age groups (<50, 50-59, 60-69, >70). Follow-up was modeled with a 
discrete-time partially observable Markov decision process. The decision to test 
for recurrences was made two times per year. Recurrences could be detected by 
mammography as well as by self-detection. For all age groups, it was optimal to 
have more intensive follow-up around the peak in recurrence risk in the second 
year after diagnosis. For the first age group (<50) with the highest risk, a 
slightly more intensive follow-up with one extra visit was proposed compared to 
the current guideline recommendation. The other age groups were recommended less 
visits: four for ages 50-59, three for 60-69, and three for ≥70. With this model 
for risk-based follow-up, clinicians can make informed decisions and focus 
resources on patients with higher risk, while avoiding unnecessary and 
potentially harmful follow-up visits for women with very low risks. The model 
can easily be extended to take into account more risk factors and provide even 
more personalized follow-up schedules.

The B7-H4 molecule, a unique negative regulator of T lymphocytes which is 
overexpressed on the surface of various tumor cells, is a particularly important 
target candidate for tumor therapy because it can be blocked with anti-B7-H4 
antibodies to inhibit the B7-H4 signaling pathway. Our previous work established 
an anti-B7-H4 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) library, so we have now 
amplified the genes encoding anti-B7-H4-scFv and human IgG1 CH3 and ligated them 
by overlap extension PCR to obtain a recombinant gene. After sequencing, the 
gene was cloned into the expression vector pET43.1a and expression was induced 
in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The 
protein was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin column and 
its antigen specificity and affinity were examined by ELISA and western 
blotting. We also established a Lewis lung cancer model in C57BL/6 mice to 
further identify the biological function of the scFv protein in vivo. The 
results showed that tumor volume, body weight and necrotic tissues in the 
control group were significantly greater than in the experimental group, 
indicating that selected scFvs had good biological activity and could inhibit 
tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Our work thus offers a new approach for the 
development of cancer-targeted therapy.

Over the last few decades, cerebrovascular surgery has gravitated towards a 
minimally invasive philosophy without compromising the foundational principles 
of patient safety and surgical efficacy. Enhanced radiosurveillance modalities 
and increased average life expectancy have resulted in an increased reported 
incidence of intracranial aneurysms. Although endovascular therapies have gained 
popularity in the recent years, microsurgical clipping continues to be of value 
in the management of these aneurysms owing to its superior occlusion rates, 
applicability to complex aneurysms and reduced retreatment rates. The concept of 
keyhole transcranial procedures has advanced the field significantly leading to 
decreased postoperative neurological morbidity and quicker recovery. The main 
keyhole neurosurgical approaches include the supraorbital craniotomy (SOC), 
lateral supraorbital craniotomy (LSOC), mini-pterional craniotomy (MPTC), 
mini-orbitozygomatic craniotomy and the mini anterior interhemispheric approach 
(MAIA). As these minimally invasive approaches can have an inherent limitation 
of a narrow viewing angle and low regional illumination, the use of endoscopic 
assistance in such procedures is being popularized. Neuroendoscopy can aid in 
the visualization of hidden neurovascular structures and inspection of the 
parent arterial segment without undue retraction of the lesion. This review 
focuses on the historical progression of the surgical management of intracranial 
aneurysms, the technical details of various minimally invasive approaches, 
patient selection and clinical outcomes of the anterior circulation aneurysms 
and useful tenets to avoid complications during these procedures. Meticulous 
preoperative planning to understand the patient's vascular anatomy, the 
orientation and relationship of the aneurysm to adjacent structures, use of 
neuronavigation guidance and endoscopic assistance if needed can lead to an 
optimal surgical outcome while minimizing neurological morbidity and mortality.

OBJECTIVES: To describe age at death (AD) in ten cohorts of middle-aged men 
followed-up until nearly extinction as a function of personal characteristics 
measured at baseline.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cohorts of men aged 40-59 years in five European countries 
(Finland, the Netherlands, Italy, Serbia, Greece) were examined and then 
followed-up for mortality during 45 (3 cohorts) or 50 years (7 cohorts). 
Multiple linear regression (MLR) models were computed with AD as dependent 
variable and 35 personal characteristics as independent variables.
RESULTS: Out of 7047 men, 6798 (96.5%) died in 45-50 years. Average AD was 74.4 
(median 75) years. Only five variables were significant in all the five 
countries when tested by MLR. By pooling together all countries and selecting 
variables by a stepwise technique, 20 were significant (p < .05): age at entry 
examination, being married, being a never smoker or an ex-smoker (versus current 
smokers), forced expiratory volume, high socio-economic status, arm 
circumference, subscapular skinfold, having moderate or vigorous physical 
activity (all with a positive relationship with AD); father early mortality, 
laterality/linearity index, high systolic blood pressure, high serum 
cholesterol, having a major cardiovascular disease, diabetes or chronic 
bronchitis (these with a negative relationship), while body mass index, 
subdivided into four classes, showed a parabolic relationship (versus a 
reference class). Each factor was associated with a difference of months or a 
few years to AD, while their combinations were associated with several years of 
greater or smaller AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of a relatively small number of risk factors 
measured in middle-aged men allows making rough estimates of AD as related to 
all-cause mortality during a follow-up of 50 years. AD is also a valuable 
metrics to describe past health in nearly extinct populations. Key messages We 
aimed at studying the age at death (AD) of middle-aged men of the European 
cohorts of the Seven Countries Study, followed-up 45-50 years until nearly 
extinction, as a function of personal characteristics measured at baseline. 
Multiple linear regression (MLR) models were computed with AD as dependent 
variable and 35 personal characteristics or risk factors as independent 
variables and only five were significant in all individual countries, whereas 
pooling together all countries, 20 variables were significant as selected by 
stepwise MLR. Each factor was associated with differences of months or a few 
years to AD, while their combinations were associated with several years of 
greater or smaller AD. AD is a valuable metrics to describe past health in 
nearly extinct populations: it might also be used to communicate years of life 
gained by preventive measures on modifiable variables.

Currently, separate measures are used to estimate the impact of animal diseases 
on mortality and animal welfare. This article introduces a novel metric, the 
Welfare-Adjusted Life Year (WALY), to estimate disease impact by combining 
welfare compromise and premature death components. Adapting the 
Disability-Adjusted Life Year approach used in human health audits, we propose 
WALY as the sum of a) the years lived with impaired welfare due to a particular 
cause and b) the years of life lost due to the premature death from the same 
cause. The years lived with impaired welfare are the product of the average 
duration of each welfare impediment, reflecting the actual condition that 
compromises animal welfare, the probability of an incident case developing and 
impaired welfare weights, representing the degree of impaired welfare. The years 
of life lost are calculated using the standard expected lifespan at the time of 
premature death. To demonstrate the concept, we estimated WALYs for 10 common 
canine diseases, namely mitral valve disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic 
kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, atopic dermatitis, splenic haemangiosarcoma, 
appendicular osteosarcoma, cranial cruciate ligament disease, thoracolumbar 
intervertebral disc disease and cervical spondylomyelopathy. A survey of 
veterinarians (n = 61) was conducted to elicit impaired welfare weights for 35 
welfare impediments. Paired comparison was the primary method to elicit weights, 
whereas visual analogue scale and time trade-off approaches rescaled these 
weights onto the desired scale, from 0 (the optimal welfare imaginable) to 1 
(the worst welfare imaginable). WALYs for the 10 diseases were then estimated 
using the impaired welfare weights and published epidemiological data on disease 
impacts. Welfare impediment "amputation: one limb" and "respiratory distress" 
had the lowest and highest impaired welfare weights at 0.134 and 0.796, rescaled 
with a visual analogue scale, and 0.117 and 0.857, rescaled with time trade-off. 
Among the 10 diseases, thoracolumbar intervertebral disc disease and atopic 
dermatitis had the smallest and greatest adverse impact on dogs with WALYs at 
2.83 (95% UI: 1.54-3.94) and 9.73 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 7.17-11.8), 
respectively. This study developed the WALY metric and demonstrated that it 
summarises welfare compromise as perceived by humans and total impact of 
diseases in individual animals. The WALY can potentially be used for 
prioritisation of disease eradication and control programs, quantification of 
population welfare and longitudinal surveillance of animal welfare in companion 
animals and may possibly be extended to production animals.

Combined Antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved life-expectancy of people 
living with HIV (PLHIV) but as they age, prevalence of chronic non-AIDS related 
comorbidities may increase. We study the evolution of HIV-disease markers and 
comorbidities' prevalence in PLHIV in Greece. Two cross-sectional analyses (2003 
and 2013) on data from the AMACS cohort were performed. Comparisons were based 
on population average models and were repeated for subjects under follow-up at 
both 2003 and 2013. 2,403 PLHIV were identified in 2003 and 4,910 in 2013 (1,730 
contributing for both cross-sections). Individuals in 2013 were on average 
older, diagnosed/treated for HIV for longer, more likely to be on cART, 
virologically suppressed, and with higher CD4 counts. Chronic kidney disease, 
dyslipidemia and hypertension prevalence increased over time. There was an 
increase in prescription of lipid-lowering treatment (3.5% in 2003 vs. 7.7% 
2013, p<0.001). Among 220 and 879 individuals eligible for Framingham 10-year 
Event Risk calculation, the proportion of patients in the high-risk group (>20%) 
increased from 18.2% to 22.2% (p = 0.002). Increase in the prevalence of 
comorbidities was more pronounced in the subset of patients who were followed in 
both 2003 and 2013. The increased availability and uptake of cART led to 
significant improvements in the immuno-virological status of PLHIV in Greece, 
but they aged alongside an increase in prevalence of non-AIDS related 
comorbidities. These results highlight the need for appropriate monitoring, 
optimal cART selection and long-term management and prevention strategies for 
such comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: In the early-life environment, proper development of the placenta is 
essential for both fetal and maternal health. Telomere length at birth has been 
related to life expectancy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as potential epigenetic 
determinants of telomere length at birth have not been identified. In this 
study, we investigate whether placental miRNA expression is associated with 
placental telomere length at birth.
METHODS: We measured the expression of seven candidate miRNAs (miR-16-5p, 
-20a-5p, -21-5p, -34a-5p, 146a-5p, -210-3p and -222-3p) in placental tissue at 
birth in 203 mother-newborn (51.7% girls) pairs from the ENVIRONAGE birth 
cohort. We selected miRNAs known to be involved in crucial cellular processes 
such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cellular senescence related to aging. 
Placental miRNA expression and relative average placental telomere length were 
measured using RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: Both before and after adjustment for potential covariates including 
newborn's ethnicity, gestational age, paternal age, maternal smoking status, 
maternal educational status, parity, date of delivery and outdoor temperature 
during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, placental miR-34a, miR-146a, miR-210 and 
miR-222 expression were significantly (p ≤ 0.03) and positively associated with 
placental relative telomere length in newborn girls. In newborn boys, only 
higher expression of placental miR-21 was weakly (p = 0.08) associated with 
shorter placental telomere length. Significant miRNAs explain around 6-8% of the 
telomere length variance at birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Placental miR-21, miR-34a, miR-146a, miR-210 and miR-222 exhibit 
sex-specific associations with telomere length in placenta. Our results indicate 
miRNA expression in placental tissue could be an important determinant in the 
process of aging starting from early life onwards.

BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a group of heterogeneous cancers 
that develop in cells in the diffuse neuroendocrine system.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness of three interventions 
[everolimus (Afinitor®; Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland), 
lutetium-177 DOTATATE (177Lu-DOTATATE) (Lutathera®; Imaging Equipment Ltd, 
Radstock, UK) and sunitinib (Sutent®; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA)] for 
treating unresectable or metastatic NETs with disease progression and establish 
the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.
DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched from inception to May 2016: 
MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily, Epub 
Ahead of Print, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web 
of Science.
REVIEW METHODS: We systematically reviewed the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness literature on everolimus, 177Lu-DOTATATE and sunitinib for 
treating advanced, unresectable or metastatic progressive NETs. The following 
NET locations were considered separately: pancreas, gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
and lung, and GI tract (midgut only). We wrote a survival partition cohort-based 
economic evaluation in Microsoft Excel® 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, 
WA, USA) from the UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. This 
comprised three health states: (1) progression-free survival (PFS), (2) 
progressed disease and (3) death.
RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), RADIANT-3 [RAD001 in 
Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Third Trial; pancreatic NETs (pNETs): everolimus 
vs. best supportive care (BSC)], A6181111 (pNETs: sunitinib vs. BSC) and 
RADIANT-4 (RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Fourth Trial; GI and lung 
NETs: everolimus vs. BSC), met the inclusion criteria for the clinical 
effectiveness systematic review. The risk of bias was low. Although the NETTER-1 
(Neuroendocrine Tumors Therapy) RCT, of 177Lu-DOTATATE plus 30 mg of octreotide 
(Sandostatin®, Novartis) compared with 60 mg of octreotide, was excluded from 
the review, we nonetheless present the results of this trial, as it informs our 
estimate of the cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-DOTATATE. The pNETs trials 
consistently found that the interventions improved PFS and overall survival (OS) 
compared with BSC. Our indirect comparison found no significant difference in 
PFS between everolimus and sunitinib. Estimates of OS gain were confounded 
because of high rates of treatment switching. After adjustment, our indirect 
comparison suggested a lower, but non-significant, hazard of death for sunitinib 
compared with everolimus. In GI and lung NETs, everolimus significantly improved 
PFS compared with BSC and showed a non-significant trend towards improved OS 
compared with BSC. Adverse events were more commonly reported following 
treatment with targeted interventions than after treatment with BSC. In the base 
case for pNETs, assuming list prices, we estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for everolimus compared with BSC of £45,493 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and for sunitinib compared with BSC of 
£20,717 per QALY. These ICERs increased substantially without the adjustment for 
treatment switching. For GI and lung NETs, we estimated an ICER for everolimus 
compared with BSC of £44,557 per QALY. For GI (midgut) NETs, the ICERs were 
£199,233 per QALY for everolimus compared with BSC and £62,158 per QALY for a 
scenario analysis comparing 177Lu-DOTATATE with BSC. We judge that no treatment 
meets the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) end-of-life 
criteria, although we cannot rule out that sunitinib in the A6181111 trial does.
LIMITATIONS: A RCT with included comparators was not identified for
