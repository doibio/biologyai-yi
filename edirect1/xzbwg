increased doses as well as combination with hormonal treatment. Moderate 
hypofractionation is safe and effective, but longer-term data are still lacking. 
Brachytherapy represents an effective way to increase the delivered dose. Focal 
therapy remains experimental while cryosurgery and HIFU are still lacking 
long-term convincing results.
CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge in the field of diagnosis, staging, and treatment of 
localised PCa is evolving rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa 
summarise the most recent findings and advice for the use in clinical practice. 
These are the first PCa guidelines endorsed by the European Society for 
Radiotherapy and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology 
and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is 
available from the EAU office and online 
(http://uroweb.org/guideline/prostate-cancer/).
PATIENT SUMMARY: The 2016 EAU-STRO-IOG Prostate Cancer (PCa) Guidelines present 
updated information on the diagnosis, and treatment of clinically localised 
prostate cancer. In Northern and Western Europe, the number of men diagnosed 
with PCa has been on the rise. This may be due to an increase in opportunistic 
screening, but other factors may also be involved (eg, diet, sexual behaviour, 
low exposure to ultraviolet radiation). We propose that men who are potential 
candidates for screening should be engaged in a discussion with their clinician 
(also involving their families and caregivers) so that an informed decision may 
be made as part of an individualised risk-adapted approach.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy is gaining acceptance as a valid treatment 
option for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer; however, its value for 
clearly resectable pancreatic cancer remains controversial. The aim of this 
study was to use a Markov decision analysis model, in the absence of adequately 
powered randomized trials, to compare the life expectancy (LE) and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of neoadjuvant therapy to conventional 
upfront surgical strategies in resectable pancreatic cancer patients.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was created to compare two strategies: 
attempted pancreatic resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by restaging with, if appropriate, 
attempted pancreatic resection. Data obtained through a comprehensive systematic 
search in PUBMED of the literature from 2000 to 2015 were used to estimate the 
probabilities used in the model. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Of the 786 potentially eligible studies identified, 22 studies met the 
inclusion criteria and were used to extract the probabilities used in the model. 
Base case analyses of the model showed a higher LE (32.2 vs. 26.7 months) and 
QALE (25.5 vs. 20.8 quality-adjusted life months) for patients in the 
neoadjuvant therapy arm compared to upfront surgery. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses for LE and QALE revealed that neoadjuvant therapy is favorable in 59% 
and 60% of the cases respectively.
CONCLUSION(S): Although conceptual, these data suggest that neoadjuvant therapy 
offers substantial benefit in LE and QALE for resectable pancreatic cancer 
patients. These findings highlight the value of further prospective randomized 
trials comparing neoadjuvant therapy to conventional upfront surgical 
strategies.

Schwann cell (SC) transplantation has been utilized for spinal cord repair and 
demonstrated to be a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, we 
investigated the feasibility of combining SC transplantation with novel conduits 
to bridge the completely transected adult rat spinal cord. This is the first and 
initial study to evaluate the potential of using a fibrous piezoelectric 
polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) conduit with SCs for 
spinal cord repair. PVDF-TrFE has been shown to enhance neurite growth in vitro 
and peripheral nerve repair in vivo. In this study, SCs adhered and proliferated 
when seeded onto PVDF-TrFE scaffolds in vitro. SCs and PVDF-TrFE conduits, 
consisting of random or aligned fibrous inner walls, were transplanted into 
transected rat spinal cords for 3 weeks to examine early repair. Glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ astrocyte processes and GFP (green fluorescent 
protein)-SCs were interdigitated at both rostral and caudal spinal cord/SC 
transplant interfaces in both types of conduits, indicative of permissivity to 
axon growth. More noradrenergic/DβH+ (dopamine-beta-hydroxylase) brainstem axons 
regenerated across the transplant when greater numbers of GFAP+ astrocyte 
processes were present. Aligned conduits promoted extension of DβH+ axons and 
GFAP+ processes farther into the transplant than random conduits. Sensory CGRP+ 
(calcitonin gene-related peptide) axons were present at the caudal interface. 
Blood vessels formed throughout the transplant in both conduits. This study 
demonstrates that PVDF-TrFE conduits harboring SCs are promising for spinal cord 
repair and deserve further investigation. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2017;114: 444-456.

Health disparities are pervasive in the United States. Health and health care 
disparities are the differences or gaps in health (eg, life expectancy, 
morbidity, risk factors, and quality of life) and health care access and quality 
between segments of the United States population as related to race/ethnicity 
and socioeconomic status (eg, income, education). Multiple factors are 
associated with such disparities in asthma management and education. This 
article explores some of those factors and summarizes the strategies developed 
and interventions implemented to address disparities associated with asthma care 
and education among racial and ethnic minority children. It also discusses the 
need for further research to identify effective asthma education approaches for 
improving the management of asthma among racial and ethnic minority children. 
More exploration of the root causes of health care disparities, including policy 
studies in the area of social determinates of health and health equity, is also 
needed.

AIMS: The quality and quantity of the infiltration of immune cells into tumour 
tissues have substantial impacts on patients' clinical outcomes, and are 
associated with response to immunotherapy. Therefore, the precise analysis of 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is becoming an important additional 
pathological biomarker. Analysis of TILs is usually performed semiquantitatively 
by pathologists on haematoxylin and eosin-stained or immunostained tissue 
sections. However, automated quantification outperforms semiquantitative 
approaches, and is becoming the standard. Owing to the presence of melanin 
pigment, this approach is seriously hampered in melanoma, because the spectrum 
of melanin lies close to that of commonly used immunohistochemical stains. Aim 
of this study is to overcome the technical issues due to the presence of melanin 
for an automated and accurate quantification of TILs in melanoma.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we successfully applied a novel multispectral imaging 
(MSI) technique to enumerate T cells in human primary melanomas. This microscopy 
technique combines imaging with spectroscopy to obtain both quantitative 
expression data and the tissue distributions of different cellular markers. We 
demonstrate that MSI allows complete and accurate analysis of TILs, successfully 
avoiding the blurring of images by melanin pigments, in whole tissue slide 
primary melanoma lesions, which could otherwise not be accurately detected by 
conventional digital image methodologies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential of MSI for accurate assessment 
of immune cell infiltrates, including those in notoriously difficult tissues, 
such as pigmented melanomas. Quantification of tumour infiltration by different 
immune cell types is crucial in the search for new biomarkers to predict patient 
responses to immunotherapies. Our findings show that this innovative microscopy 
technique is an important extension of the armamentarium of pathologists.

BACKGROUND: Sacubitril-valsartan therapy reduces cardiovascular mortality 
compared with enalapril therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril-valsartan versus 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic heart 
failure.
DESIGN: Markov decision model.
DATA SOURCES: Clinical trials, observational analyses, reimbursement data from 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, drug pricing databases, and 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention life tables.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients at an average age of 64 years, New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) class II to IV heart failure, and left ventricular ejection 
fraction of 0.40 or less.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Treatment with sacubitril-valsartan or lisinopril.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, heart 
failure hospitalizations, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The sacubitril-valsartan group experienced 0.08 
fewer heart failure hospitalization, 0.69 additional life-year, 0.62 additional 
QALY, and $29 203 in incremental costs, equating to a cost per QALY gained of 
$47 053. The cost per QALY gained was $44 531 in patients with NYHA class II 
heart failure and $58 194 in those with class III or IV heart failure.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Sacubitril-valsartan treatment was most 
sensitive to the duration of improved outcomes, with a cost per QALY gained of 
$120 623 if the duration was limited to the length of the trial (median, 27 
months). No variations in other parameters caused the cost to exceed $100 000 
per QALY gained.
LIMITATION: The benefit of sacubitril-valsartan is based on a single clinical 
trial.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with sacubitril-valsartan provides reasonable value in 
reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with NYHA class II 
to IV heart failure.

Stable coronary artery disease is of epidemiological importance. It is becoming 
increasingly common due to the longer life expectancy, being strictly related to 
age and to advances in diagnostic techniques and pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological interventions.Stable coronary artery disease encompasses a 
variety of clinical and anatomic presentations, making the identification of its 
clinical and anatomical features challenging. Therapeutic interventions should 
be defined on an individual basis according to the patient's risk profile. To 
this aim, management flow-charts have been reviewed based on sustainability and 
appropriateness derived from recent evidence. Special emphasis has been placed 
on non-pharmacological interventions, stressing the importance of lifestyle 
changes, including smoking cessation, regular physical activity and diet. 
Adherence to therapy as an emerging risk factor is also discussed.

PURPOSE: The EMILIA trial demonstrated that trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) 
significantly increased the median profession-free and overall survival relative 
to combination therapy with lapatinib plus capecitabine (LC) in patients with 
HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC) previously treated with trastuzumab 
and a taxane. We performed an economic analysis of T-DM1 as a second-line 
therapy compared to LC and monotherapy with capecitabine (C) from both 
perspectives of the US payer and society.
METHODS: We developed four possible Markov models for ABC to compare the 
projected life-time costs and outcomes of T-DM1, LC, and C. Model transition 
probabilities were estimated from the EMILIA and EGF100151 clinical trials. 
Direct costs of the therapies, major adverse events, laboratory tests, and 
disease progression, indirect costs (productivity losses due to morbidity and 
mortality), and health utilities were obtained from published sources. The 
models used 3 % discount rate and reported in 2015 US dollars. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and model averaging were used to account for model 
parametric and structural uncertainty.
RESULTS: When incorporating both model parametric and structural uncertainty, 
the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) comparing T-DM1 to LC 
and T-DM1 to C were $183,828 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and 
$126,001/QALY from the societal perspective, respectively. From the payer's 
perspective, the ICERs were $220,385/QALY (T-DM1 vs. LC) and $168,355/QALY 
(T-DM1 vs. C).
CONCLUSIONS: From both perspectives of the US payer and society, T-DM1 is not 
cost-effective when comparing to the LC combination therapy at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY. T-DM1 might have a better chance 
to be cost-effective compared to capecitabine monotherapy from the US societal 
perspective.

The economic evaluation (EE) of health care products has become a necessity. 
Their quality must be high in order to trust the results and make informed 
decisions. While cost-utility analyses (CUAs) should be preferred to 
cost-effectiveness analyses in the oncology area, the quality of breast cancer 
(BC)-related CUA has been given little attention so far. Thus, firstly, a 
systematic review of published CUA related to drug therapies for BC, gene 
expression profiling, and HER2 status testing was performed. Secondly, the 
quality of selected CUA was assessed and the factors associated with a 
high-quality CUA identified. The systematic literature search was conducted in 
PubMed, MEDLINE/EMBASE, and Cochrane to identify published CUA between 2000 and 
2014. After screening and data extraction, the quality of each selected CUA was 
assessed by two independent reviewers, using the checklist proposed by Drummond 
et al. The analysis of factors associated with a high-quality CUA (defined as a 
Drummond score ≥7) was performed using a two-step approach. Our systematic 
review was based on 140 CUAs and showed a wide variety of methodological 
approaches, including differences in the perspective adopted, the time horizon, 
measurement of cost and effectiveness, and more specially health-state utility 
values (HSUVs). The median Drummond score was 7 [range 3-10]. Only one in two of 
the CUA (n = 74) had a Drummond score ≥7, synonymous of "high quality." The 
statistically significant predictors of a high-quality CUA were article with 
"gene expression profiling" topic (p = 0.001), consulting or pharmaceutical 
company as main location of first author (p = 0.004), and articles with both 
incremental cost-utility ratio and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as 
outcomes of EE (p = 0.02). Our systematic review identified only 140 CUAs 
published over the past 15 years with one in two of high quality. It showed a 
wide variety of methodological approaches, especially focused on HSUVs. A 
critical appraisal of utility values is necessary to better understand one of 
the main difficulties encountered by authors and propose areas for improvement 
to increase the quality of CUA. Since the last 5 years, there is a tendency 
toward an improvement in the quality of these studies, probably coupled with 
economic context, a better and widely spreading of recommendations and thus 
appropriation by medical practitioners. That being said, there is an urgent need 
for mandatory use of European and international recommendations to ensure 
quality of such approaches and to allow easy comparison.

The adoption of primary (PP) versus secondary prophylaxis (SP) of febrile 
neutropenia (FN), with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), for 
adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) regimens in breast cancer (BC) could be affected by 
its "value for money". This systematic review examined (i) cost-effectiveness of 
PP versus SP, (ii) FN threshold at which PP is cost-effective including the 
guidelines 20 % threshold and (iii) potential impact of G-CSF efficacy 
assumptions on outcomes. The systematic review identified all 
cost-effectiveness/cost-utility analyses (CEA/CUA) involving PP versus SP G-CSF 
for AC in BC that met predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Five relevant 
CEA/CUA were identified. These CEA/CUA examined different AC regimens (TAC = 2; 
FEC-D = 1; TC = 2) and G-CSF formulations (filgrastim "F" = 4; pegfilgrastim 
"P" = 4) with varying baseline FN-risk (range 22-32 %), mortality (range 
1.4-6.0 %) and utility (range 0.33-0.47). The potential G-CSF benefit, including 
FN risk reduction with P versus F, varied among models. Overall, relative to SP, 
PP was not associated with good value for money, as per commonly utilized CE 
thresholds, at the baseline FN rates examined, including the consensus 20 % FN 
threshold, in most of these studies. The value for money associated with PP 
versus SP was primarily dependent on G-CSF benefit assumptions including reduced 
FN mortality and improved BC survival. PP G-CSF for FN prevention in BC patients 
undergoing AC may not be a cost-effective strategy at the guidelines 20 % FN 
threshold.

Aging population and longer life expectancy are the main reasons for an 
increasing number of patients with wound problems. Although the interest in 
wound care increases continuously, wound management still remains a challenge 
mainly due to the higher occurrence of chronic wounds, which require intensive 
care and constant monitoring. Here, we demonstrate a fluorescent sensing system 
to monitor the wound status and to distinguish between an autonomously healing 
and a chronic wound at an early stage. The system allows monitoring two of the 
most relevant fluctuating wound parameters during the healing process which are 
pH and glucose concentration. A fluorescent pH indicator dye, 
carboxynaphthofluorescein, and a metabolite-sensing enzymatic system, based on 
glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, were immobilized on a biocompatible 
polysaccharide matrix to develop a functional hydrogel coating for wound 
monitoring. The changes in metabolite and enzyme concentration in artificial 
wound extract were converted into a fluorescent signal.

With Cancer? Exploring Associations and Pathways.

Purpose Perceived quality of care (QOC) is an increasingly important metric of 
care quality and can be affected by such factors among patients with cancer as 
quality of life and physician trust. This study sought to evaluate whether 
informal caregiver well-being was also associated with perceived QOC among 
patients with cancer and assessed potential pathways that link these factors. 
Methods This study used data from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and 
Surveillance (CanCORS) consortium. Patients with lung and colorectal cancer 
enrolled in CanCORS (N = 689) nominated an informal caregiver to participate in 
a caregiving survey. Both groups self-reported sociodemographic, psychosocial, 
and caregiving characteristics; cancer characteristics were obtained from the 
CanCORS core data set. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the 
association between caregiver psychosocial factors and subsequent 
patient-perceived QOC, controlling for earlier patient-perceived QOC and 
covariates. Secondary analysis examined potential pathways that link these 
factors. Results Patients whose informal caregiver had higher levels of 
depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to report fair or poor QOC 
(odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.13). When caregivers reported fair or poor 
self-rated health, patients were more than three times more likely to report 
fair or poor perceived QOC (odds ratio, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.76 to 9.55). Controlling 
for patient psychosocial factors and physician communication and coordination of 
medical care reduced the effect size and/or statistical significance of these 
relationships. Conclusion Informal caregivers are an important part of the care 
team and their well-being is associated with patient-perceived QOC. Engaging 
informal cancer caregivers as part of the care team and conducting ongoing risk 
stratification screening and intervention to optimize their health may improve 
patient-reported outcomes and QOC.

In order to examine potential differences in genomic stability, we have 
challenged fibroblasts derived from five different mammalian species of variable 
longevity with the genotoxic agents, etoposide and neocarzinostatin. We report 
that cells from longer-lived species exhibit more tumor protein p53 binding 
protein 1 (53BP1) foci for a given degree of DNA damage relative to 
shorter-lived species. The presence of a greater number of 53BP1 foci was 
associated with decreased DNA fragmentation and a lower percentage of cells 
exhibiting micronuclei. These data suggest that cells from longer-lived species 
have an enhanced DNA damage response. We propose that the number of 53BP1 foci 
that form in response to damage reflects the intrinsic capacity of cells to 
detect and respond to DNA harms.

The ability to design and construct structures with atomic level precision is 
one of the key goals of nanotechnology. Proteins offer an attractive target for 
atomic design because they can be synthesized chemically or biologically and can 
self-assemble. However, the generalized protein folding and design problem is 
unsolved. One approach to simplifying the problem is to use a repetitive protein 
as a scaffold. Repeat proteins are intrinsically modular, and their folding and 
structures are better understood than large globular domains. Here, we have 
developed a class of synthetic repeat proteins based on the pentapeptide repeat 
family of beta-solenoid proteins. We have constructed length variants of the 
basic scaffold and computationally designed de novo loops projecting from the 
scaffold core. The experimentally solved 3.56-Å resolution crystal structure of 
one designed loop matches closely the designed hairpin structure, showing the 
computational design of a backbone extension onto a synthetic protein core 
without the use of backbone fragments from known structures. Two other loop 
designs were not clearly resolved in the crystal structures, and one loop 
appeared to be in an incorrect conformation. We have also shown that the repeat 
unit can accommodate whole-domain insertions by inserting a domain into one of 
the designed loops.

Lafora disease (LD) is an autosomal recessive form of progressive myoclonic 
epilepsy that is caused by mutations in EPM2A, encoding laforin, and NHLRC1 
(EPM2B), encoding malin.(1) LD is classically described with onset in early 
teenage years. Patients develop myoclonus, epilepsy, visual hallucinations, and 
psychosis. Dementia is a prominent feature and often occurs in the late teenage 
years. LD typically progresses quickly, and patients become bedridden and 
dependent within 10 years of symptom onset, with life expectancy in the early 
20s.(2,3) Only a small number of late-onset cases of LD have been described. 
Even then, these so-called late-onset cases have typically presented in the 20s, 
with dementia occurring in the early 30s. We describe a patient with extremely 
late onset and extended survival with prominent parkinsonism due to a novel 
EPM2A variant.

Accuracy of Oncologists' Life-Expectancy Estimates Recalled by Their Advanced 
Cancer Patients: Correlates and Outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Oncologists are often reluctant to discuss life-expectancy estimates 
with their patients because of concerns about their inaccuracy and limited 
evidence regarding benefits.
OBJECTIVE: Determine oncologist accuracy in predicting their advanced cancer 
patients' life expectancy and correlates associated with accuracy.
DESIGN: Multicenter prospective, longitudinal study of patients with advanced 
cancer, assessed once at baseline and followed to death. At baseline, patients 
were asked whether their oncologist had provided them with a life-expectancy 
estimate.
SETTING/SUBJECTS: Eighty-five patients with advanced cancer recruited from 
outpatient cancer clinics.
MEASUREMENTS: Patients' baseline sociodemographic and time to death, and 
clinical characteristics were examined to determine their associations with the 
accuracy of the oncologists' life-expectancy estimates as recalled by their 
patients.
RESULTS: Seventy-four percent (63/85) of patients recalled that physician 
life-expectancy estimates were accurate to within a year; estimates were most 
accurate when patients had 9-12 months to live. Factors significantly (p < 0.05) 
positively associated with oncologists' greater accuracy to within a year were 
the patient's age, recruitment from a community-based oncology clinic, poor 
performance status, and quality-of-life at baseline. Oncologists' prognoses that 
were accurate to within a year were associated with greater likelihood of 
patients, at baseline, acknowledging that they were terminally ill (OR = 12.20, 
95% CI = 2.24-66.59), engaging in an end-of-life discussion (OR = 4.22, 95% 
CI = 1.45-12.29), completing a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order (OR = 2.94, 95% 
CI = 1.03-8.41), a lower likelihood of using palliative chemotherapy (OR = 0.30, 
95% CI = 0.11-0.85), and clinical trial enrollment (OR = 0.09, 95% 
CI = 0.02-0.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists are able to estimate their patients' life expectancy to 
within a year. Accuracy to within a year is associated with higher rates of DNR 
order completion, advance care planning, and lower likelihood of chemotherapy 
use near death.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major problem for public 
health; timely antiviral treatment can significantly prevent the progression of 
liver damage from HBV by slowing down or stopping the virus from reproducing. In 
the study we applied Bayesian approach to cost-effectiveness analysis, using 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods for the relevant evidence 
input into the model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of entecavir (ETV) and 
lamivudine (LVD) therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Jiangsu, China, thus 
providing information to the public health system in the CHB therapy.
METHODS: Eight-stage Markov model was developed, a hypothetical cohort of 
35-year-old HBeAg-positive patients with CHB was entered into the model. 
Treatment regimens were LVD100mg daily and ETV 0.5 mg daily. The transition 
parameters were derived either from systematic reviews of the literature or from 
previous economic studies. The outcome measures were life-years, 
quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs), and expected costs associated with the 
treatments and disease progression. For the Bayesian models all the analysis was 
implemented by using WinBUGS version 1.4.
RESULTS: Expected cost, life expectancy, QALYs decreased with age. 
Cost-effectiveness increased with age. Expected cost of ETV was less than LVD, 
while life expectancy and QALYs were higher than that of LVD, ETV strategy was 
more cost-effective. Costs and benefits of the Monte Carlo simulation were very 
close to the results of exact form among the group, but standard deviation of 
each group indicated there was a big difference between individual patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with lamivudine, entecavir is the more cost-effective 
option. CHB patients should accept antiviral treatment as soon as possible as 
the lower age the more cost-effective. Monte Carlo simulation obtained costs and 
effectiveness distribution, indicate our Markov model is of good robustness.

BACKGROUND: Nonembolic acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a condition characterized by 
a sudden decrease in limb perfusion and requires immediate interventions. There 
are multiple treatment options available including surgery, catheter-directed 
thrombolysis (CDT), endovascular procedures, and hybrid treatment (a combination 
of open and endovascular techniques). Randomized trials provide information only 
on clinical efficacy, but not on economic outcomes. The objective of the study 
was to perform the cost-effective analysis comparing different treatment 
alternatives of ALI.
METHODS: The data were collected from 4r ProMedica community hospitals in the 
Northwest Ohio from January 2009 to December 2012. Patients were included if 
they were treated within 14 days of onset of symptoms for nonembolic ALI and 
were divided into groups of receiving CDT, surgery, endovascular, or hybrid 
treatments. Demographics, comorbidities, medications taken before admission, and 
smoking status were collected at baseline for all patients and were compared 
among the treatment groups. A cost-effectiveness decision tree was developed to 
calculate expected costs and life years gained associated with available 
treatment options. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also performed to 
check the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: A population of 205 patients with the diagnosis of ALI was included and 
divided into different treatment groups. There was no major significant 
difference in baseline characteristics among the studied groups (P > 0.05). The 
total costs were $17,163.47 for surgery, $20,620.39 for endovascular, $21,277.61 
for hybrid, and $30,675.42 for CDT. The life years gained were 17.25 for 
surgery, 18 for endovascular, 18 for hybrid, and 17 for CDT. CDT was dominated 
because of the high cost and the low effectiveness, while hybrid treatment was 
dominated when compared with endovascular treatment because these 2 treatments 
have similar outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the 
endovascular group over the surgery group was found to be $4,609.23 per life 
year gained. The sensitivity analysis showed that the endovascular treatment was 
found to be cost-effective under willingness to pay $50,000.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides economic evaluation of ALI treatments for a 
defined clinical population in the real-world setting. Compared with other 
available alternatives, the endovascular treatment showed to be a cost-effective 
use of healthcare resources.

Nanotechnology has provided new tools for addressing unmet clinical situations, 
especially in the oncology field. The development of smart nanocarriers able to 
deliver chemotherapeutic agents specifically to the diseased cells and to 
release them in a controlled way has offered a paramount advantage over 
conventional therapy. Areas covered: Among the different types of nanoparticle 
that can be employed for this purpose, inorganic porous materials have received 
significant attention in the last decade due to their unique properties such as 
high loading capacity, chemical and physical robustness, low toxicity and easy 
and cheap production in the laboratory. This review discuss the recent advances 
performed in the application of porous inorganic and metal-organic materials for 
antitumoral therapy, paying special attention to the application of mesoporous 
silica, porous silicon and metal-organic nanoparticles. Expert opinion: The use 
of porous inorganic nanoparticles as drug carriers for cancer therapy has the 
potential to improve the life expectancy of the patients affected by this 
disease. However, much work is needed to overcome their drawbacks, which are 
aggravated by their hard nature, exploiting the advantages offered by highly the 
ordered pore network of these materials.

Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) are at increased risk of developing 
and dying from cancer. However, controversies exist around cancer screening in 
this population owing to reduced life expectancy and competing causes of death. 
This systematic review assesses the availability, quality and consistency of 
cancer screening recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). We 
systematically searched bibliographic databases and gray literature to identify 
CPGs and assessed their quality using AGREE II. Recommendations were extracted 
along with their supporting evidence. Thirteen guidelines were included in the 
review. CPGs for kidney recipients were the most frequent source of screening 
recommendations, and recommendations for skin cancer screening were most 
frequently presented. Some screening recommendations differed from those for the 
general population, based on literature demonstrating higher cancer incidence 
among SOTRs versus direct evidence of screening effectiveness. Relevant 
stakeholders such as oncology specialists, primary care providers and public 
health experts were not involved in the formulation of the screening 
recommendations. In conclusion, although several guidelines make recommendations 
for cancer screening in SOTRs, the availability of cancer screening 
recommendations varied considerably by transplanted organ. More studies are 
required to inform cancer screening recommendations in SOTRs, and guideline 
development should involve transplant patients, oncologists and cancer screening 
specialists.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to highlight the progression from the early definition of 
nononcologic outcomes in prostate cancer (PC) to measurement and use of 
preferences to ensure appropriate treatment decisions in men with localized 
disease.
METHODS: We review the assessment of nononcologic outcomes after PC treatment 
and ways to use the outcomes to augment patient care.
RESULTS: PC treatments may have similar oncologic efficacy in men with certain 
clinical features, but they differ in their nononcologic outcomes. Tools to 
assess these outcomes have been developed and are useful in areas from treatment 
reimbursement to shared decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability to measure and make useful data on nononcologic 
outcomes evolved substantially over the past 20 years. Current work suggests 
that individual preference assessment for nononcologic outcomes is a promising 
means of matching patients with appropriate treatment.
