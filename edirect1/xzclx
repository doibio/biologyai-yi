BACKGROUND: The addition of ribociclib (RIB) to letrozole (LET) significantly 
increases progression free survival for patients with hormone-receptor 
(HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced 
breast cancer (ABC). We identified the range of drug costs for which RIB could 
be considered cost effective from a Chinese perspective.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to model the treatment 
sequences among patients with ABC. Life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs 
(QALYs) and lifetime costs were estimated. Costs were estimated for Chinese 
health care systems. Three times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of 
China 2016 ($24,360) and three times the per capita GDP of Beijing city 2016 
($53,384) were used as the willingness-to-pay threshold. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, RIB + LET provided an incremental survival 
benefit of 0.631 LYs and 0.451 QALYs. When RIB costs less than $721 or $1170 per 
4 weeks, there was a nearly 90% likelihood that the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for RIB + LET would be less than $24,360 per QALY or 
$53,384 per QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A value-based price for the cost of RIB is $732 or $1170 per 4 weeks 
for China and Beijing City, respectively. Our study is helpful to inform the 
multilateral drug price negotiations in China that may be upcoming for RIB.

Patients with schizophrenia could have a higher risk of mortality. We compared 
the risk of mortality and the years of potential life lost (YPLL) associated 
with various causes of death between patients with schizophrenia and the general 
population. A total of 4,298 patients with schizophrenia were included. The 
cohort was linked to the Taiwan Death Register between 1998 and 2010 using 
personal identification numbers, which showed 367 patients with schizophrenia 
had died by the end of 2010. The standard mortality ratios (SMRs) and YPLL were 
analyzed by age, sex and cause of death. The overall SMR was significantly 
higher in patients with schizophrenia. Suicide had the most significantly 
greater SMR, and the SMRs for physical illnesses, accidents and injuries were 
all significantly greater in patients with schizophrenia. Suicide had the 
largest YPLL/deaths among all causes of mortality in patients with 
schizophrenia. Suicide had the most significantly greater risk of mortality 
among patients with schizophrenia as compared with the general population. 
Patients with schizophrenia are highly vulnerable in terms of increased 
mortality and require special attention.

BACKGROUND: Elderly individuals are increasingly represented among patients with 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), but data describing life with an 
ICD are scarse among octo- and nonagenarians. Moreover, few studies have 
reported those elderly patients' perspective on timly discussions concerning 
what shock deactivation involves, preferences on battery replacement, and their 
attitudes about turning off the ICD nearing end-of-life. Consequently, the aim 
of the study was to describe outlooks on life and death in octo- and 
nonagenarian ICD-recipients.
METHODS: Participants were identified via the Swedish Pacemaker- and 
ICD-registry, with 229 octo- and nonagenarians (82.0 ± 2.2 years, 12% female) 
completing the survey on one occasion. The survey involved questions on health 
and psychological measures, as well as on experiences, attitudes and knowledge 
of end-of-life issues in relation to the ICD.
RESULTS: The majority (53%) reported their existing health as being good/very 
good and rated their health status as 67 ± 18 on the EuroQol Visual Analog 
Scale. A total of 34% had experienced shock(s), 11% suffered from symptoms of 
depression, 15% had anxiety, and 26% reported concerns related to their ICD. 
About one third (34%) had discussed their illness trajectory with their 
physician, with those octo- and nonagenarians being more decisive about a future 
deactivation (67% vs. 43%, p < .01). A minority (13%) had discussed what turning 
off shocks would involve with their physician, and just 7% had told their family 
their wishes about a possible deactivation in the future. The majority desired 
battery replacement even if they had reached a very advanced age when one was 
needed (69%), or were seriously ill with a life-threatening disease (55%). When 
asked about deactivation in an anticipated terminal illness, about one third 
(34%) stated that they wanted to keep the shocks in the ICD during these 
circumstances. About one-fourth of the octo- and nonagenarians had insufficient 
knowledge regarding the ethical aspects, function of the ICD, and practical 
consequences of withdrawing the ICD treatment in the end-of-life.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing numbers of elderly persons receive an ICD and geriatric 
care must involve assessments of life expectancy as well as the patient's 
knowledge and attitudes in relation to generator changes and deactivation.

According to "OMS" we are old at age 65. Because of the ageing population (life 
expectancy has increased in Europe) and medical progress, more and more old 
patients are addressed to cardiac rehabilitation centers. Ageing is a 
physiological process which varies between individuals, and in the same person 
organ ageing also differs. Old patient has usually several pathological 
diseases. Because old patient has restricted functional reserve, acute illness 
could get him closer to the decompensation area. Complications are more frequent 
in ageing people, and often need a specific initial treatment which delays 
rehabilitation. Rehabilitation program of old non-disabled patient is not 
different from that addressed to youngers. The main objective for dependent 
people is to restore the ability to perform activities of daily living. 
Correction of vascular risk factors and therapeutic education are also valuable 
in elderly. For patients with difficulty to remember or to understand 
instructions, family help is valuable when possible. The benefit of the 
rehabilitation in the elderly is demonstrated by several studies.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), is a rare autosomal dominant 
connective tissue disease with a prevalence of 1 in 2 million. It is 
characterized by congenital foot deformities and multiple heterotopic 
ossifications in fibrous tissue. It usually starts with painful soft tissue 
swellings occurring with attacks at the ages of three or four. The attacks 
develop spontaneously or after minor trauma, and gradually turn into heterotopic 
ossifications that cause joint limitations, growth defects, skeletal deformities 
and chronic pain. The average life expectancy is forthy, and most of the 
patients are lost due to pulmonary complications. FOP is often misdiagnosed as 
fibromatosis, desmoid tumour or cancer, bunion, myositis, arthritis and 
rheumatic diseases. After clinical suspicion, confirmatory genetic analysis 
should be used for the diagnosis. The treatment of FOP is currently supportive. 
An effective, proven method has not yet been established. Herein, we present an 
18-year-old female patient with FOP who underwent different treatment modalities 
in a 5-year period. This case-based review reveals all available treatment 
approaches with at least 6-month follow-up for FOP in the literature.

BACKGROUND: Patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch 
repair-deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) show a significant 
response to checkpoint inhibitor therapies, but the economic impact of these 
therapies is unknown. A decision analytic model was used to explore the 
effectiveness and cost burden of MSI-H/dMMR mCRC treatment.
METHODS: The treatment of hypothetical patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC was 
simulated in 2 treatment scenarios: a third-line treatment and an exploratory 
first-line treatment. The treatments compared were nivolumab, ipilimumab and 
nivolumab, trifluridine and tipiracil (third-line treatment), and mFOLFOX6 and 
cetuximab (first-line treatment). Disease progression, drug toxicity, and 
survival rates were based on the CheckMate 142, study of TAS-102 in patients 
with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies 
(RECOURSE), and Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Southwest Oncology Group 80405 
trials. The analyzed outcomes included survival (life-years), quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Ipilimumab with nivolumab was the most effective strategy (10.69 
life-years and 9.25 QALYs for the third line; 10.69 life-years and 9.44 QALYs 
for the first line) in comparison with nivolumab (8.21 life-years and 6.76 QALYs 
for the third line; 8.21 life-years and 7.00 QALYs for the first line), 
trifluridine and tipiracil (0.74 life-years and 0.07 QALYs), and mFOLFOX6 and 
cetuximab (2.72 life-years and 1.63 QALYs). However, neither checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy was cost-effective in comparison with trifluridine and 
tipiracil (nivolumab ICER, $153,000; ipilimumab and nivolumab ICER, $162,700) or 
mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab (nivolumab ICER, $150,700; ipilimumab and nivolumab ICER, 
$158,700).
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling analysis found that both single and dual checkpoint 
blockade could be significantly more effective for MSI-H/dMMR mCRC than 
chemotherapy, but they were not cost-effective, largely because of drug costs. 
Decreases in drug pricing and/or the duration of maintenance nivolumab could 
make ipilimumab and nivolumab cost-effective. Prospective clinical trials should 
be performed to explore the optimal duration of maintenance nivolumab.

BACKGROUND: In the UK, gout management is suboptimum, with only 40% of patients 
receiving urate-lowering therapy, usually without titration to achieve a target 
serum urate concentration. Nurses successfully manage many diseases in primary 
care. We compared nurse-led gout care to usual care led by general practitioners 
(GPs) for people in the community.
METHODS: Research nurses were trained in best practice management of gout, 
including providing individualised information and engaging patients in shared 
decision making. Adults who had experienced a gout flare in the previous 12 
months were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive nurse-led care or continue with 
GP-led usual care. We assessed patients at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. The 
primary outcome was the percentage of participants who achieved serum urate 
concentrations less than 360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL) at 2 years. Secondary outcomes 
were flare frequency in year 2, presence of tophi, quality of life, and cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were 
calculated based on intention to treat with multiple imputation. This study is 
registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01477346.
FINDINGS: 517 patients were enrolled, of whom 255 were assigned nurse-led care 
and 262 usual care. Nurse-led care was associated with high uptake of and 
adherence to urate-lowering therapy. More patients receiving nurse-led care had 
serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L at 2 years than those receiving 
usual care (95% vs 30%, RR 3·18, 95% CI 2·42-4·18, p<0·0001). At 2 years all 
secondary outcomes favoured the nurse-led group. The cost per QALY gained for 
the nurse-led intervention was £5066 at 2 years.
INTERPRETATION: Nurse-led gout care is efficacious and cost-effective compared 
with usual care. Our findings illustrate the benefits of educating and engaging 
patients in gout management and reaffirm the importance of a treat-to-target 
urate-lowering treatment strategy to improve patient-centred outcomes.

The objective was to determine relationships between protein and energy consumed 
from milk replacer and starter and calf growth and first-lactation production of 
Holstein heifer calves. Milk replacer and starter protein intake and 
metabolizable energy (ME) intake data were collected from 4,534 Holstein heifer 
calves for growth and 3,627 Holstein cows for production from birth year of 2004 
through 2014. Calves from 3 commercial dairy farms were assigned to 45 different 
calf research trials at the University of Minnesota Southern Research and 
Outreach Center, Waseca, Minnesota, from 3 to 195 d of life. Calves were moved 
to heifer growers at 6 mo of age, and calves were returned to their farm of 
birth a few weeks before calving. Most calves (85%) were fed a 20% crude protein 
and 20% fat milk replacer at a rate of 0.57 kg/calf daily. Metabolizable energy 
and protein consumed from milk replacer and starter were calculated for each 
individual calf for 6 and 8 wk of age. Mixed model analyses were conducted to 
determine the effect of protein and energy consumed from both milk replacer and 
starter on calf growth and first-lactation 305-d production of milk, fat, and 
protein, adjusting for herd, season of birth, year, average daily gain (ADG), 
and calf trial. Calves with ADG >0.80 kg/d consumed more combined protein and ME 
than calves with lower ADG. Protein and ME intake from calf starter affected 
growth more than protein and ME intake from milk replacer because most calves 
were fed the same fixed amount of milk replacer. Calves born during the fall and 
winter had greater combined protein and ME intake than calves born during the 
spring and summer. Milk replacer protein and ME intake did not have a 
relationship with first-lactation 305-d milk, fat, and protein production. 
However, starter protein and ME intake during the first 6 and 8 wk of age had a 
significant positive relationship with first-lactation 305-d milk, fat, and 
protein production. Consequently, combined protein and combined ME intake had a 
positive effect on 305-d milk, fat, and protein production. Variance in protein 
and ME intake was high, suggesting that additional factors affect calf growth 
during the first 8 wk of life and milk production in first lactation.

Background and objectives: Improved quality of life (QoL) and life expectancy of 
elderly diabetic patients revolves around optimal glycemic control. Inadequate 
glycemic control may lead to the development of diabetes-associated 
complications (DAC), which not only complicate the disease, but also affect 
morbidity and mortality. Based on the available literature, the aim was to 
elucidate the vicious cycle underpinning the relationship between diabetes 
complications and glycemic control. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive 
literature search was performed to find eligible studies published between 1 
January 2000 and 22 September 2018 pertaining to diabetes complications and 
glycemic control. Results: Initially, 261 studies were retrieved. Out of these, 
67 were duplicates and therefore were excluded. From the 194 remaining articles, 
85 were removed based on irrelevant titles and/or abstracts. Subsequently, the 
texts of 109 articles were read in full and 71 studies were removed at this 
stage for failing to provide relevant information. Finally, 38 articles were 
selected for this review. Depression, impaired cognition, poor physical 
functioning, frailty, malnutrition, chronic pain, and poor self-care behavior 
were identified as the major diabetes-associated complications that were 
associated with poor glycemic control in elderly diabetic patients. Conclusions: 
This paper proposes that diabetes-associated complications are interrelated, and 
that impaired glycemic control aggravates diabetes complications; as a result, 
patient's self-care abilities are compromised. A schema is generated to reflect 
a synthesis of the literature found through the systematic review process. This 
not only affects patients' therapeutic goals, but may also hamper their 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and financial status.

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system and is 
manifested by diffuse invasion of glioblastoma stem cells into the healthy 
tissue, chemoresistance and recurrence. Despite aggressive therapy, consisting 
of maximal surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide 
(Temodal®), life expectancy of patients with glioblastoma is typically less than 
15 months. In general, natural isothiocyanates isolated from plants of the 
Cruciferae family are selectively cytotoxic to tumor cells. It has been 
demonstrated previously that diisothiocyanate-derived mercapturic acids are 
highly cytotoxic to colon cancer cells. In the present study, the application of 
diisothiocyanate-derived mercapturic acids led to a decrease in the viability of 
an established glioblastoma cell line, primary patient-derived sphere-cultured 
stem cell-enriched cell populations (SCs), and cells differentiated from SCs. 
Consequently, targeting glioblastoma cells by diisothiocyanate-derived 
mercapturic acids is a promising approach to restrict tumor cell growth and may 
be a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment of glioblastoma.

Several species of insects have become model systems for studying learning and 
memory formation. Although many studies focus on freely moving animals, studies 
implementing classical conditioning paradigms with harnessed insects have been 
important for investigating the exact cues that individuals learn and the neural 
mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation. Here we present a protocol 
for evoking visual associative learning in wood ants through classical 
conditioning. In this paradigm, ants are harnessed and presented with a visual 
cue (a blue cardboard), the conditional stimulus (CS), paired with an appetitive 
sugar reward, the unconditional stimulus (US). Ants perform a Maxilla-Labium 
Extension Reflex (MaLER), the unconditional response (UR), which can be used as 
a readout for learning. Training consists of 10 trials, separated by a 5-minute 
intertrial interval (ITI). Ants are also tested for memory retention 10 minutes 
or 1 hour after training. This protocol has the potential to allow researchers 
to analyze, in a precise and controlled manner, the details of visual memory 
formation and the neural basis of learning and memory formation in wood ants.

Palpita forficifera Munroe, 1959 (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is the main pest of 
the olive tree (Olea europaea L. Oleaceae) in Brazil. This study investigated 
the biology of P. forficifera reared on different hosts and elaborated the 
corresponding fertility life table for a better understanding of its 
development. Biology of P. forficifera was studied using olive cultivars 
Arbequina, Arbosana and Koroneiki and the alternative host privet (Ligustrum 
lucidum Ait., Oleaceae), under controlled conditions of temperature (25 ± 2°C), 
relative humidity (60 ± 10%), and photophase (14 h). We evaluated duration and 
viability of egg, larva, and pupa stages; number and duration of instars; sex 
ratio; pupa weight; duration of preoviposition, oviposition, and postoviposition 
periods; fecundity and longevity. The fertility life table was elaborated from 
these parameters. Larvae fed with privet had longer larval stage, and 
consequently, egg-pupa period. Larva viability was lower in cv. Arbosana, which 
reflected in lower viability in the egg-pupa period. Larvae fed with cv. 
Koroneiki originated females with higher fecundity. From the joint assessment of 
the biological parameters and the fertility life tables, cv. Koroneiki provided 
the greatest population increase, while cv. Arbosana impaired P. forficifera 
development. Thus, in areas of high occurrence of this species, cv. Arbosana 
should be considered as the more indicated cultivar for the establishment of new 
olive groves.

BACKGROUND: Oncologists use patients' life expectancy to guide decisions and may 
benefit from a tool that accurately predicts prognosis. Existing prognostic 
models generally use only a few predictor variables. We used an electronic 
medical record dataset to train a prognostic model for patients with metastatic 
cancer.
METHODS: The model was trained and tested using 12 588 patients treated for 
metastatic cancer in the Stanford Health Care system from 2008 to 2017. Data 
sources included provider note text, labs, vital signs, procedures, medication 
orders, and diagnosis codes. Patients were divided randomly into a training set 
used to fit the model coefficients and a test set used to evaluate model 
performance (80%/20% split). A regularized Cox model with 4126 predictor 
variables was used. A landmarking approach was used due to the multiple 
observations per patient, with t0 set to the time of metastatic cancer 
diagnosis. Performance was also evaluated using 399 palliative radiation courses 
in test set patients.
RESULTS: The C-index for overall survival was 0.786 in the test set (averaged 
across landmark times). For palliative radiation courses, the C-index was 0.745 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.715 to 0.775) compared with 0.635 (95% CI = 
0.601 to 0.669) for a published model using performance status, primary tumor 
site, and treated site (two-sided P < .001). Our model's predictions were 
well-calibrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The model showed high predictive performance, which will need to be 
validated using external data. Because it is fully automated, the model can be 
used to examine providers' practice patterns and could be deployed in a decision 
support tool to help improve quality of care.

BACKGROUND: People with diabetes have a high risk of developing micro and 
macrovascular complications that increase treatment costs and shorten life 
expectancy. Telecoaching programmes can improve short-term control of diabetes 
and reduce disease burden.
AIMS: To analyse the effect of a health telecoaching programme in the control of 
type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: A pragmatic clinical trial was carried out. Thirty-one patients with 
type 2 diabetes were divided into control and intervention groups. The control 
group received usual nursing care, and those in the intervention group received 
usual care and telecoaching for 24 weeks.
FINDINGS: The intervention group improved: measurements of abdominal 
circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body mass index; 
variables related to glycaemic control (fasting venous glucose and glycated 
haemoglobin/HbA1c); and high-density lipoprotein levels.
CONCLUSION: The data indicate that telecoaching is an effective tool for 
diabetes management. It is recommended that the study should be developed to 
include more people and run over the long term.

AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor 
secukinumab vs the currently licensed biologic therapies in ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) patients from a Canadian healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A decision analytic model (semi-Markov) evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg compared to certolizumab pegol, 
adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, and infliximab and 
infliximab biosimilar in a biologic-naïve population, over 60 years of time 
horizon (lifetime). The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index 
(BASDAI 50) response rate was used to assess treatment response at week 12. 
Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic therapy were 
allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters 
(short-term and long-term changes in BASDAI and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis 
Functional Index [BASFI], withdrawal rates, adverse events, costs, resource use, 
utilities, and disutilities) were obtained from clinical trials, published 
literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost and benefits were discounted with an 
annual discount rate of 1.5% for all treatments.
RESULTS: In the biologic-naïve population, secukinumab 150 mg dominated all 
comparators, as patients treated with secukinumab 150 mg achieved the highest 
QALYs (16.46) at the lowest cost (CAD 533,010) over a lifetime horizon vs 
comparators. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, results were most 
sensitive to changes in baseline BASFI non-responders, BASDAI 50 at 3 months and 
discount rates. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that secukinumab 
150 mg demonstrated higher probability of achieving maximum net monetary benefit 
vs all comparators at various cost thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that secukinumab 150 mg is the most 
cost-effective treatment option for biologic-naïve AS patients compared to 
certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, golimumab, etanercept and etanercept biosimilar, 
and infliximab and infliximab biosimilar for a lifetime horizon in Canada. 
Treatment with secukinumab translates into substantial benefits for patients and 
the healthcare system.

A dynamic, modifiable model for estimating cost-effectiveness of smoking 
cessation interventions in pregnancy: application to an RCT of self-help 
delivered by text message.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous evaluations of smoking cessation interventions in 
pregnancy have several limitations. Our solution to these limitations is the 
Economics of Smoking in Pregnancy (ESIP) model, which estimates the life-time 
cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy from a 
National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services perspective. We aim 
to (1) describe how ESIP has been constructed and (2) illustrate its use with 
trial data.
METHODS: ESIP links mothers' and offspring pregnancy outcomes to estimate the 
burdens of smoking-related disease they experience with different rates of 
smoking in pregnancy, both in pregnancy and throughout their life-times. Smoking 
rates are inputted by model users. ESIP then estimates the costs of treating 
disease burdens and also mothers' and offspring life-years and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). By comparing costs incurred and healthy life following 
different smoking rates, ESIP estimates incremental cost-effectiveness and 
benefit-cost ratios for mothers or offspring or both combined. We illustrate 
ESIP use using data from a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that tested a 
smoking cessation intervention in pregnancy.
RESULTS: Throughout women's and offspring life-times, the intervention proved 
cheaper than usual care, having a negative incremental cost of £38.37 
(interquartile range = £21.46-56.96) and it improved health, demonstrating a 
0.04 increase in incremental QALYs for mothers and offspring, implying that it 
is 'dominant' over usual care. Benefit-cost ratios suggested that every £1 spent 
would generate a median of £14 (interquartile range = £8-20) in health-care 
savings.
CONCLUSIONS: Economics of Smoking in Pregnancy is the first economic model to 
link mothers' and infants' costs and benefits while reporting cost-effectiveness 
in readily-comparable units. Using ESIP with data from a trial which reported 
only short-term economic analysis showed that the intervention was very likely 
to be cost-effective in the longer term and to generate health-care savings.

BACKGROUND: Cities have unique geographic, environmental and sociocultural 
characteristics that influence the health status of their citizens. 
Identification and modification of these characteristics may help to promote 
healthier cities.
OBJECTIVE: We estimated premature mortality impacts of breaching international 
exposure guidelines for physical activity (PA), air pollution, noise and access 
to green space for Bradford (UK) adult residents (n = 393,091).
METHODS: We applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment 
(UTOPHIA) methodology and estimated mortality, life expectancy (LE) and economic 
impacts of non-compliance with recommended exposure levels. We also investigated 
the distribution of the mortality burden among the population, focusing on 
socioeconomic position (SEP) as defined by deprivation status and ethnicity.
RESULTS: We estimated that annually almost 10% of premature mortality (i.e. 375 
deaths, 95% CI: 276-474) in Bradford is attributable to non-compliance with 
recommended exposure levels. Non-compliance was also estimated to result in over 
300 days of LE lost (95% CI: 238-432), which translated in economic losses of 
over £50,000 per person (95% CI: 38,518-69,991). 90% of the premature mortality 
impact resulted from insufficient PA performance. Air and noise pollution and 
the lack of green space had smaller impacts (i.e. 48 deaths). Residents of lower 
SEP neighborhoods had the highest risks for adverse exposure and premature 
death. A larger number of deaths (i.e. 253 and 145, respectively) could be 
prevented by reducing air and noise pollution levels well below the guidelines.
DISCUSSION: Current urban and transport planning related exposures result in a 
considerable health burden that is unequally distributed among the Bradford 
population. Improvements in urban and transport planning practices including the 
reduction of motor traffic and the promotion of active transport together with 
greening of the district, particularly in areas of lower SEP, are promising 
strategies to increase PA performance and reduce harmful environmental 
exposures.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize the goals and approaches of clinicians with 
experience discussing long-term prognostic information with older adults.
DESIGN: We used a semistructured interview guide containing 2 domains of 
perceived benefits and strategies to explore why and how clinicians choose to 
discuss long-term prognosis, defined as life expectancy on the scale of years, 
with patients.
SETTING: Clinicians from home-based primary care practices, community-based 
clinics, and academic medical centers across San Francisco.
PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen physicians, including 11 geriatricians and 1 geriatric 
nurse practitioner, with a mean age of 40 and a mean 9 years in practice.
MEASUREMENTS: Clinician responses were analyzed qualitatively using the constant 
comparisons approach.
RESULTS: Perceived benefits of discussing long-term prognosis included 
establishing realistic expectations for patients, encouraging conversations 
about future planning, and promoting shared decision-making through 
understanding of patient goals of care. Communication strategies included 
adapting discussions to individual patient preferences and engaging in multiple 
conversations over time. Clinicians preferred to communicate prognosis in words 
and with a visual aid, although most did not know of a suitable visual aid.
CONCLUSION: Engaging in customized longitudinal discussions of long-term 
prognosis aids clinicians in anchoring conversations about future planning and 
preparing patients for the end of life. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:2367-2371, 2018.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are significant global issues. Honey 
bees are excellent models for learning and other complex behaviors; furthermore, 
they share many behavioral responses to ethanol (EtOH) with humans and animal 
models. We develop a 2-feeder choice assay to determine whether honey bees will 
self-administer and preferentially consume solutions containing EtOH.
METHODS: Gustatory responsiveness to EtOH is determined using the proboscis 
extension reflex and consumption assays. A 2-feeder choice assay is used to 
examine preference for the consumption of EtOH. Survival assays assess the 
metabolic and toxic effects of EtOH consumption.
RESULTS: Honey bees find the taste of EtOH to be aversive when in water, but 
addition of sucrose masks the aversive taste. Even though the taste of EtOH is 
not appetitive, honey bees preferentially consume sucrose solutions containing 
1.25 to 2.5% EtOH in a dose-dependent manner. Based on survival assays, honey 
bees may not be able to derive caloric value from EtOH, and EtOH concentrations 
of 2.5% or higher lead to significant increases in mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Honey bees will self-administer EtOH and show a preference for 
consuming solutions containing EtOH. Bees may not be able to efficiently utilize 
EtOH as an energy source, but EtOH-dependent increases in mortality complicate 
separating the effects of caloric value and toxicity.

Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
and reduced life expectancy. We thus hypothesized that anti-angiogenic miRs are 
increased in T1DM, and the cardioprotective effect of metformin is mediated via 
reducing those miRs. In an open label, case-controlled study, 23 T1DM patients 
without CVD were treated with metformin for eight weeks (TG), matched with nine 
T1DM patients on standard treatment (SG) and 23 controls (CG). Plasma miR-222, 
miR-195, miR-21a and miR-126 were assayed by real-time RT-qPCR. The results were 
correlated with: endothelial function (RHI), circulating endothelial progenitor 
cells (cEPCs) (vascular repair marker, CD45dimCD34⁺VEGFR2⁺ cells) and 
circulating endothelial cells (cECs) (vascular injury marker, 
CD45dimCD34⁺CD133⁻CD144⁺ cells). miR-222, miR-195 and miR-21a were higher in 
T1DM than CG; p = 0.009, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0001, respectively. There was an 
inverse correlation between logmiR-222 and logRHI (p < 0.05) and a direct 
correlation between logmiR-222 and logCD34⁺ (p < 0.05) in TG. Metformin reduced 
miR-222, miR-195 and miR-21a levels in TG; p = 0.007, p = 0.002 p = 0.0012, 
respectively. miRs remained unchanged in SG. miR-126 was similar in all groups. 
There was a positive association between changes in logmiR-222 and logcECs after 
metformin in TG (p < 0.05). Anti-angiogenic miRs are increased in T1DM. 
Metformin has cardioprotective effects through downregulating miR-222, miR-195 
and miR-21a, beyond improving glycemic control.
