BACKGROUND: Intracranial abscesses are rare and life-threatening conditions that 
typically originate from direct extension from nearby structures, hematogenous 
dissemination or following penetrating cerebral trauma or neurosurgery.
FINDINGS: A 36-year-old male presented to our emergency department with 
complaints of left eye swelling, headache and drowsiness. On physical exam, the 
patient was febrile and his left upper eyelid was markedly swollen with 
fluctuance and drainage. Maxillofacial computed tomography was obtained to 
evaluate for orbital pathology but revealed bifrontal brain abscesses.
CONCLUSIONS: Brain abscesses should be considered in the differential diagnosis 
for patients who present with the classic triad of headache, fever and 
neurological deficit.

Although treatment for the dialysis population is resource intensive, a 
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) by matched pairs is still lacking. After matching for clinical 
characteristics and propensity scores, we identified 4,285 pairs of incident HD 
and PD patients from a Taiwanese national cohort during 1998-2010. Survival and 
healthcare expenditure were calculated by data of 14-year follow-up and 
subsequently extrapolated to lifetime estimates under the assumption of constant 
excess hazard. We performed a cross-sectional EQ-5D survey on 179 matched pairs 
of prevalent HD and PD patients of varying dialysis vintages from 12 dialysis 
units. The product of survival probability and the mean utility value at each 
time point (dialysis vintage) were summed up throughout lifetime to obtain the 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). The results revealed the estimated life 
expectancy between HD and PD were nearly equal (19.11 versus 19.08 years). The 
QALE's were also similar, whereas average lifetime healthcare costs were higher 
in HD than PD (237,795 versus 204,442 USD) and the cost-effectiveness ratios for 
PD and HD were 13,681 and 16,643 USD per quality-adjusted life year, 
respectively. In conclusion, PD is more cost-effective than HD, of which the 
major determinants were the costs for the dialysis modality and its associated 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) constitutes a major public health problem 
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Newborn screening and early subsequent clinical 
intervention can reduce early mortality and increase life expectancy, but have 
not been widely implemented in SSA. This analysis assesses the 
cost-effectiveness of a newborn screening and prophylactic intervention (NSPI) 
package for SCD in 47 SSA countries.
METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with annual cycles was built with infants 
either being screened using isoelectric focusing (IEF) or not screened. 
Confirmed positive cases received interventions including insecticide-treated 
mosquito bed nets, folic acid supplementation, prophylactic antimalarial and 
penicillin therapy, and vaccinations against bacterial infections. Estimates for 
the local incidence of SCD, the life expectancy of untreated children, the SCD 
disability weight, and the cost of screening laboratory tests were based on 
published sources. Among treated infants, the annual probability of mortality 
until 30 years of age was derived from a pediatric hospital-based cohort. The 
outcome of interest included a country-specific cost per Disability Adjusted 
Life Year (DALY) averted.
RESULTS: Of 47 modeled countries in SSA, NSPI is almost certainly highly 
cost-effective in 24 countries (average cost per DALY averted: US$184); in 10 
countries, it is cost-effective in the base case (average cost per DALY averted: 
US$285), but the results are subject to uncertainty; in the remaining 13, it is 
most likely not cost-effective. We observe a strong inverse relationship between 
the incidence rate of SCD and the cost per DALY averted. Newborn screening is 
estimated to be cost-effective as long as the incidence rate exceeds 0.2-0.3 %, 
although in some countries NSPI is cost-effective at incidence rates below this 
range. In total, NSPI could avert over 2.4 million disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs) annually across SSA.
CONCLUSIONS: Using IEF to screen all newborns for SCD plus administration of 
prophylactic interventions to affected children is cost-effective in the 
majority of countries in SSA.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a common, debilitating, and costly disorder. Many 
patients request psychological therapy, but the best-evidenced therapy-cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT)-is complex and costly. A simpler therapy-behavioural 
activation (BA)-might be as effective and cheaper than is CBT. We aimed to 
establish the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of BA compared with CBT 
for adults with depression.
METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, we recruited 
adults aged 18 years or older meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders IV criteria for major depressive disorder from primary care and 
psychological therapy services in Devon, Durham, and Leeds (UK). We excluded 
people who were receiving psychological therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, 
were acutely suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 2 months, or were 
cognitively impaired, or who had bipolar disorder or psychosis or psychotic 
symptoms. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) remotely using 
computer-generated allocation (minimisation used; stratified by depression 
severity [Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score of <19 vs ≥19], 
antidepressant use, and recruitment site) to BA from junior mental health 
workers or CBT from psychological therapists. Randomisation done at the 
Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit was concealed from investigators. Treatment was 
given open label, but outcome assessors were masked. The primary outcome was 
depression symptoms according to the PHQ-9 at 12 months. We analysed all those 
who were randomly allocated and had complete data (modified intention to treat 
[mITT]) and also all those who were randomly allocated, had complete data, and 
received at least eight treatment sessions (per protocol [PP]). We analysed 
safety in the mITT population. The non-inferiority margin was 1·9 PHQ-9 points. 
This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN27473954.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 26, 2012, and April 3, 2014, we randomly allocated 221 
(50%) participants to BA and 219 (50%) to CBT. 175 (79%) participants were 
assessable for the primary outcome in the mITT population in the BA group 
compared with 189 (86%) in the CBT group, whereas 135 (61%) were assessable in 
the PP population in the BA group compared with 151 (69%) in the CBT group. BA 
was non-inferior to CBT (mITT: CBT 8·4 PHQ-9 points [SD 7·5], BA 8·4 PHQ-9 
points [7·0], mean difference 0·1 PHQ-9 points [95% CI -1·3 to 1·5], p=0·89; PP: 
CBT 7·9 PHQ-9 points [7·3]; BA 7·8 [6·5], mean difference 0·0 PHQ-9 points [-1·5 
to 1·6], p=0·99). Two (1%) non-trial-related deaths (one [1%] multidrug toxicity 
in the BA group and one [1%] cancer in the CBT group) and 15 depression-related, 
but not treatment-related, serious adverse events (three in the BA group and 12 
in the CBT group) occurred in three [2%] participants in the BA group (two [1%] 
patients who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed) and eight (4%) participants 
in the CBT group (seven [4%] who overdosed and one [1%] who self-harmed).
INTERPRETATION: We found that BA, a simpler psychological treatment than CBT, 
can be delivered by junior mental health workers with less intensive and costly 
training, with no lesser effect than CBT. Effective psychological therapy for 
depression can be delivered without the need for costly and highly trained 
professionals.

BACKGROUND: The combination of stem cell-based gene therapy with chemotherapy 
comprises an advantageous strategy that results in a reduction of system 
toxicity effects and an improvement in the general efficacy of treatment. In the 
present study, we estimated the efficacy of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal 
stem cells (AT-MSCs) expressing cytosine deaminase (CDA) combined with 
lysomustine chemotherapy in mice bearing late stage Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC).
METHODS: Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells were transfected with 
non-insert plasmid construct transiently expressing fused cytosine 
deaminase-uracil phosphoribosyltransferase protein (CDA/UPRT) or the same 
construct fused with Herpes Simplex Virus Type1 tegument protein VP22 
(CDA/UPRT/VP22). Systemic administration of 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) and 
lysomustine was implemented after a single intratumoral injection of transfected 
AT-MSCs.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that direct intratumoral transplantation of AT-MSCs 
expressing CDA/UPRT or CDA/UPRT/VP22 followed by systemic administration of 5FC 
resulted in a significant tumor growth inhibition. There was a 56% reduction in 
tumor volume in mice treated by AT-MSCs-CDA/UPRT + 5FC or with 
AT-MSCs-CDA/UPRT/VP22 + 5FC compared to control animals grafted with lung 
carcinoma alone. Transplantation of AT-MSCs-CDA/UPRT + 5FC and 
AT-MSCs-CDA/UPRT/VP22 + 5FC prolonged the life span of mice bearing LLC by 27% 
and 31%, respectively. Co-administration of lysomustine and 
AT-MSCs-CDA/UPRT + 5FC led to tumor growth inhibition (by 86%) and life span 
extension (by 60%) compared to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that a combination CDA/UPRT-expressing AT-MSCs 
with lysomustine has a superior antitumor effect in the murine lung carcinoma 
model compared to monotherapies with transfected AT-MSCs or lysomustine alone, 
possibly because of a synergistic effect of the combination therapy. Copyright ©

BACKGROUND: Cachexia affects the majority of patients with advanced cancer and 
is associated with reduced treatment tolerance, response to therapy, quality of 
life, and life expectancy. Cachectic patients with advanced cancer often receive 
anti-cancer therapies against their specific cancer type as a standard of care, 
and whether specific ActRII inhibition is efficacious when combined with 
anti-cancer agents has not been elucidated yet.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated interactions between ActRII blockade and 
anti-cancer agents in CT-26 mouse colon cancer-induced cachexia model. CDD866 
(murinized version of bimagrumab) is a neutralizing antibody against the activin 
receptor type II (ActRII) preventing binding of ligands such as myostatin and 
activin A, which are involved in cancer cachexia. CDD866 was evaluated in 
association with cisplatin as a standard cytotoxic agent or with everolimus, a 
molecular-targeted agent against mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In the 
early studies, the treatment effect on cachexia was investigated, and in the 
additional studies, the treatment effect on progression of cancer and the 
associated cachexia was evaluated using body weight loss or tumor volume as 
interruption criteria.
RESULTS: Cisplatin accelerated body weight loss and tended to exacerbate 
skeletal muscle loss in cachectic animals, likely due to some toxicity of this 
anti-cancer agent. Administration of CDD866 alone or in combination with 
cisplatin protected from skeletal muscle weight loss compared to animals 
receiving only cisplatin, corroborating that ActRII inhibition remains fully 
efficacious under cisplatin treatment. In contrast, everolimus treatment alone 
significantly protected the tumor-bearing mice against skeletal muscle weight 
loss caused by CT-26 tumor. CDD866 not only remains efficacious in the presence 
of everolimus but also showed a non-significant trend for an additive effect on 
reversing skeletal muscle weight loss. Importantly, both combination therapies 
slowed down time-to-progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-ActRII blockade is an effective intervention against cancer 
cachexia providing benefit even in the presence of anti-cancer therapies. 
Co-treatment comprising chemotherapies and ActRII inhibitors might constitute a 
promising new approach to alleviate chemotherapy- and cancer-related wasting 
conditions and extend survival rates in cachectic cancer patients.

The prognostic significance of disease features at the time of diagnosis was 
examined in 113 patients (75 males/38 females, median age 49 years) with chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML) using multivariate regression analysis. In the course of 
this study we tested the validity of the prognostic model described by Sokal and 
coworkers(3), the predictive value of histopathological variables, and 
determined the disease-specific loss in life expectancy. The median survival 
time was 35 months in our patients. By using Cox's proportional hazards model 
for covariate analysis of censored survival data(26)'(32) two prognostic models 
were derived. The first consisted of the following parameters-age, presence of 
pseudo-Gaucher cells in the marrow, spleen size and the product of myeloblasts 
and normoblasts in the peripheral blood. The second model included age, the 
presence of myelofibrosis, the number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and 
the liver size. Both models provided a risk status that showed an excellent 
predictive relationship to relative survival rates and life expectancy. 
Application of the Sokal model(3) to our subpopulation of CML patients failed to 
reveal a significant segregation of the intermediate group from the other risk 
groups, even when assessing the disease-specific loss in life expectancy. Our 
results suggest that an amendment of the generally accepted model for prognostic 
evaluation of survival in CML should be made by inclusion of histological 
variables and the determination of relative survival rates.

BACKGROUND: Societies are facing medical resource scarcities, inter alia due to 
increased life expectancy and limited health budgets and also due to temporal or 
continuous physical shortages of resources like donor organs. This makes it 
challenging to meet the medical needs of all. Ethicists provide normative 
guidance for how to fairly allocate scarce medical resources, but legitimate 
decisions require additionally information regarding what the general public 
considers to be fair. The purpose of this study was to explore how lay people, 
general practitioners, medical students and other health professionals evaluate 
the fairness of ten allocation principles for scarce medical resources: 'sickest 
first', 'waiting list', 'prognosis', 'behaviour' (i.e., those who engage in 
risky behaviour should not be prioritized), 'instrumental value' (e.g., health 
care workers should be favoured during epidemics), 'combination of criteria' 
(i.e., a sequence of the 'youngest first', 'prognosis', and 'lottery' 
principles), 'reciprocity' (i.e., those who provided services to the society in 
the past should be rewarded), 'youngest first', 'lottery', and 'monetary 
contribution'.
METHODS: 1,267 respondents to an online questionnaire were confronted with 
hypothetical situations of scarcity regarding (i) donor organs, (ii) hospital 
beds during an epidemic, and (iii) joint replacements. Nine allocation 
principles were evaluated in terms of fairness for each type of scarcity along 
7-point Likert scales. The relationship between demographic factors (gender, 
age, religiosity, political orientation, and health status) and fairness 
evaluations was modelled with logistic regression.
RESULTS: Medical background was a major predictor of fairness evaluations. While 
general practitioners showed different response patterns for all three 
allocation situations, the responses by lay people were very similar. Lay people 
rated 'sickest first' and 'waiting list' on top of all allocation 
principles-e.g., for donor organs 83.8% (95% CI: [81.2%-86.2%]) rated 'sickest 
first' as fair ('fair' is represented by scale points 5-7), and 69.5% 
[66.2%-72.4%] rated 'waiting list' as fair. The corresponding results for 
general practitioners: 'prognosis' 79.7% [74.2%-84.9%], 'combination of 
criteria' 72.6% [66.4%-78.5%], and 'sickest first' 74.5% [68.6%-80.1%); these 
were the highest-rated allocation principles for donor organs allocation. 
Interestingly, only 44.3% [37.7%-50.9%] of the general practitioners rated 
'instrumental value' as fair for the allocation of hospital beds during a flu 
epidemic. The fairness evaluations by general practitioners obtained for joint 
replacements: 'sickest first' 84.0% [78.8%-88.6%], 'combination of criteria' 
65.6% [59.2%-71.8%], and 'prognosis' 63.7% [57.1%-70.0%]. 'Lottery', 
'reciprocity', 'instrumental value', and 'monetary contribution' were considered 
very unfair allocation principles by both groups. Medical students' ratings were 
similar to those of general practitioners, and the ratings by other health 
professionals resembled those of lay people.
CONCLUSIONS: Results are partly at odds with current conclusions proposed by 
some ethicists. A number of ethicists reject 'sickest first' and 'waiting list' 
as morally unjustifiable allocation principles, whereas those allocation 
principles received the highest fairness endorsements by lay people and to some 
extent also by health professionals. Decision makers are advised to consider 
whether or not to give ethicists, health professionals, and the general public 
an equal voice when attempting to arrive at maximally endorsed allocations of 
scarce medical resources.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women 
worldwide. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether higher mortality after breast 
cancer contributes to the life-expectancy gap of 15 years in women with severe 
mental illness (SMI).
METHODS: We estimated all-cause mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of women with SMI, 
women with breast cancer and women with both disorders compared to women with 
neither disorder using data from nationwide registers in Denmark for 1980-2012.
RESULTS: The cohort included 2.7 million women, hereof 31,421 women with SMI 
(12,852 deaths), 104,342 with breast cancer (52,732 deaths), and 1,106 with SMI 
and breast cancer (656 deaths). Compared to women with neither disorder, the 
mortality was 118% higher for women with SMI (MRR: 2.18, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 2.14-2.22), 144% higher for women with breast cancer (MRR: 2.44, 95% CI: 
2.42-2.47) and 327% higher for women with SMI and breast cancer (MRR: 4.27, 95% 
CI: 3.98-4.57). Among women with both disorders, 15% of deaths could be 
attributed to interaction. In a sub-cohort of women with breast cancer, the 
ten-year all-cause-mortality was 59% higher after taking tumor stage into 
account (MRR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.47-1.72) for women with versus without SMI.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality among women with SMI and breast cancer was markedly 
increased. More information is needed to determine which factors might explain 
this excess mortality, such as differences between women with and without SMI in 
access to diagnostics, provision of care for breast cancer or physical 
comorbidity, health-seeking-behavior, and adherence to treatment.

Cost-effectiveness of Canagliflozin versus Sitagliptin When Added to Metformin 
and Sulfonylurea in Type 2 Diabetes in Canada.

Sabapathy S, Neslusan C, Yoong K, Teschemaker A, Johansen P, Willis M.

BackgroundCanagliflozin, an agent that inhibits sodium glucose co-transporter 2, 
is approved as add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes in Canada. Canagliflozin offers greater glycemic control, as well as 
important additional benefits such as weight loss and blood pressure reductions, 
versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin.  ObjectiveThis 
analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of canagliflozin 300 mg and 
canagliflozin 100 mg versus sitagliptin 100 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes 
inadequately controlled on metformin plus sulfonylurea from the perspective of 
the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health. MethodsA 40-year 
cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the validated Economic and 
Health Outcomes Model of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (ECHO-T2DM). Patient 
characteristics, treatment effects, and rates of hypoglycemia and adverse events 
were sourced from the canagliflozin clinical program. Canada-specific costs and 
utilities were applied. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using alternative 
values for key model inputs. ResultsBoth canagliflozin 300 and 100 mg dominated 
sitagliptin 100 mg over 40 years, providing quality-adjusted life-year gains of 
0.31 and 0.28, and cost offsets of $2,217 and $2,560, respectively. Both 
canagliflozin doses dominated sitagliptin in each of the sensitivity 
analyses. ConclusionsSimulation results suggested that canagliflozin 300 and 100 
mg provided better health outcomes and lower costs than sitagliptin 100 mg as a 
third-line therapy added-on to metformin and sulfonylurea in patients with type 
2 diabetes in Canada.

Although clinical staging systems are useful to assess the prognosis of chronic 
lymphocyctic leukemia (CLL), for the large majority (up to 60%) of patients in 
early clinical stage no system is able to predict those who will progress 
("active" disease) and those who will remain at the same stage ("smouldering" 
disease). To identify the latter subset of patients is important since in these 
patients treatment should be withhold until progression occurs. In the past few 
years, there have been several attempts to define "smouldering" CLL. Basically, 
patients in early stage (Binet's A) with: (a) moderate bone marrow infiltration 
(non-diffuse pattern in the biopsy or less than 80% lymphocytes in bone marrow 
aspirate), (b) low blood lymphocyte count (<30 × 10(9)/L), (c) Hb level in a 
non-anemic range (> 12 or 13 g/dL), and d) prolonged lymphocyte doubling time (> 
12 months) are not likely to progress and have a life-expectancy not different 
from matched controls. In three different series analyzed so far, 
disease-progression rate is approximately 15% to 5 yrs, and survival is not 
different from that of controls. Approximately, 20 to 30% of all CLL patients 
with CLL fulfill "smouldering" criteria. Besides the above criteria, there are 
others that merit consideration. Thus, Rai's substages (AO vs AI + II) have been 
found to predict different outcomes within Binet's stage A. On the other hand, 
chromosome abnormalities may be useful to further assess the prognosis. Finally, 
the contribution of phenotypic studies to the definition of "smouldering" CLL 
remains uncertain, and a female sex has been associated with a better outcome. 
Whether or not patients with "active" stage A (e.g., those not fulfilling 
"smouldering" CLL criteria) should be treated is unknown. The morbidity 
associated to treatment (e.g. increase number of second neoplasms) and the lack 
of survival advantage found in recent randomized trials cast doubts on the real 
benefit of treating patients in early stage (Binet's A; Rai's 0). To answer this 
question, the separate analysis of patients with "smouldering" stage A and 
patients with "active" stage A included in recent trials could be of help. 
Moreover, prospective studies of patients in early stage followed-up with no 
treatment could be useful to refine the definition of "smouldering" CLL.

The Benefits of Health Maintenance.

Rosenstein AH.

In brief: Despite major medical advances, life expectancy has increased 
relatively little over the past 35 years. Most of today's serious illnesses are 
related to such chronic conditions as heart disease, cancer, and 
arteriosclerosis, rather than to acute infectious diseases. These chronic 
diseases affect the national economy as well as the health of individuals. Many 
authorities believe that 50% to 80% of the deaths related to these conditions 
could be prevented or postponed through proper nutrition, weight control, 
exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management. Accordingly, physicians 
should take a more active role in disease prevention efforts. A procedure for 
physicians to use in health assessment and risk management for M individual 
patients is outlined.

Self-sustaining lichen symbioses potentially can become very old, sometimes even 
thousands of years in nature. In the joint structures, algal partners are 
sheltered between fungal structures that are externally colonized by bacterial 
communities. With this arrangement lichens survive long periods of drought, and 
lichen thalli can be revitalized even after decades of dry storage in a 
herbarium. To study the effects of long-term ex situ storage on viability of 
indigenous bacterial communities we comparatively studied herbarium-stored 
material of the lung lichen, Lobaria pulmonaria. We discovered that a 
significant fraction of the lichen-associated bacterial community survives 
herbarium storage of nearly 80 years, and living bacteria can still be found in 
even older material. As the bacteria reside in the upper surface layers of the 
lichen material, we argue that the extracellular polysaccharides of lichens 
contribute to superior life expectancy of bacteria. Deeper understanding of 
underlying mechanisms could provide novel possibilities for biotechnological 
applications.

[Kidney transplantation in old age].

Older patients clearly benefit from a kidney transplantation despite multiple 
comorbidities and complications, particularly with respect to life expectancy. 
Older patients remaining on dialysis on average die earlier compared to patients 
who underwent a kidney transplantation. In addition, patients experience a 
significant increase in the quality of life after renal transplantation. 
However, every patient has to be thoroughly evaluated to assess the individual 
benefits of a renal transplantation. Geriatric tools are particularly helpful to 
evaluate the suitability of older individuals. In 1999 the Eurotransplant senior 
program (ESP or "old for old") was initiated, aiming at shortening waiting time 
and cold ischemia time for patients on the waiting list. In this program, 
kidneys of donors aged 65 years and older are locally allocated to recipients 
also of 65 years and older. The results in ESP are promising, to the effect that 
this program helps older patients to receive a kidney transplant earlier than by 
the normal procedure; however, a better alternative to the ESP program is living 
donor transplantation, provided that a suitable donor is available. There is no 
age limit for the evaluation of potential donors. Compared to deceased donor 
kidney transplantation a living donor kidney will most likely function with a 
higher spontaneous rate and for a longer period of time and therefore provides a 
clear advantage for older recipients.

Causal mediation analysis on failure time outcome without sequential 
ignorability.

Mediation analysis is an important topic as it helps researchers to understand 
why an intervention works. Most previous mediation analyses define effects in 
the mean scale and require a binary or continuous outcome. Recently, possible 
ways to define direct and indirect effects for causal mediation analysis with 
survival outcome were proposed. However, these methods mainly rely on the 
assumption of sequential ignorability, which implies no unmeasured confounding. 
To handle the potential confounding between the mediator and the outcome, in 
this article, we proposed a structural additive hazard model for mediation 
analysis with failure time outcome and derived estimators for controlled direct 
effects and controlled mediator effects. Our methods allow time-varying effects. 
Simulations showed that our proposed estimator is consistent in the presence of 
unmeasured confounding while the traditional additive hazard regression ignoring 
unmeasured confounding produces biased results. We applied our method to the 
Women's Health Initiative data to study whether the dietary intervention affects 
breast cancer risk through changing body weight.

BACKGROUND: No clear evidence on the comparative effectiveness of delamanid 
(DLM) and bedaquiline (BDQ) has been published.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the incremental effectiveness of DLM 
versus BDQ in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
METHODS: We developed a Markov model based on a cohort with MDR-TB, which 
consisted of success, failure, loss to follow-up, and death. The cohort 
simulation was conducted assuming each patient was 36 years old and, lived until 
age 82, and that the cycle length was 1 year. Patients with an inadequate 
response to DLM, the background regimen, or BDQ for 2 years were transitioned 
through the next treatment sequence. We evaluated the incremental effectiveness 
of the drugs using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) resulting from this 
Markov model over a lifetime.
RESULTS: The incremental effectiveness of DLM (13.96 QALYs) was greater by 2.44 
QALYs per patient than the background regimen (11.52 QALY), while the 
incremental effectiveness of BDQ (10.40 QALY) was higher by 1.14 QALY per 
patient than the background regimen (9.26 QALY). Consequently, the incremental 
effectiveness of DLM was relatively more positive by 1.30 QALY than those of BDQ 
per patient over a lifetime.
LIMITATIONS: This study is a simulation study. Therefore, the treatment sequence 
for patients may be different in the real world.
CONCLUSIONS: Our lifetime simulated data found that DLM was relatively more 
favorable than BDQ. A Markov model can be considered an alternative approach 
when there is an absence of head-to-head clinical data.

AIMING FOR THE BULL'S EYE: The Cost-Utility of Screening for Hydroxychloroquine 
Retinopathy.

Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida; and †Department of 
Ophthalmology, Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute, College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York.

BACKGROUND: Throughout medicine, the cost of various treatments has been 
increasingly studied with the result that certain management guidelines might be 
reevaluated in their context. Cost-utility is a term referring to the expense of 
preventing the loss of quality of life, quantified in dollars per 
quality-adjusted life year. In 2002, the American Academy of Ophthalmology 
published hydroxychloroquine screening recommendations which were revised in 
2011. The purpose of this report is to estimate the cost-utility of these 
recommendations.
METHODS: A hypothetical care model of screening for hydroxychloroquine 
retinopathy was formulated. The costs of screening components were calculated 
using 2016 Medicare fee schedules from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services.
RESULTS: The cost-utility of screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy with 
the 2011 American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines was found to vary from 
33,155 to 344,172 dollars per quality-adjusted life year depending on the type 
and number of objective screening tests chosen, practice setting, and the 
duration of hydroxychloroquine use. Screening had a more favorable cost-utility 
when the more sensitive and specific diagnostics were used, and for patients 
with an increased risk of toxicity.
CONCLUSION: American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines have a wide-ranging 
cost-utility. Prudent clinical judgment of risk stratification and tests chosen 
is necessary to optimize cost-utility without compromising the efficacy of 
screening.

Liposomes Encapsulating Dapivirine.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved the 
life expectancy of HIV/AIDS patients, the treatment is not curative. It is a 
global challenge which fosters an urgent need to develop an effective drug or 
neutralizing antibody delivery approach for the prevention and treatment of this 
disease. Due to the low density of envelope spikes with restricted mobility 
present on the surface of HIV virus, which limit the antibody potency and allow 
virus mutation and escape from the immune system, it is important for a 
neutralizing antibody to form bivalent or multivalent bonds with the virus. 
Liposome constructs could fulfil this need due to the flexible mobility of the 
membrane with its attached antibodies and the capacity for drug encapsulation. 
In this study, we evaluated the neutralization activity of a range of liposome 
formulations in different sizes coated with anti-gp120 llama antibody fragments 
(Vhhs) conjugated via either non-covalent metal chelation or a covalent linkage. 
The non-covalent construct demonstrated identical binding affinity to HIV-1 
envelope glycoprotein gp120 and neutralizing ability for HIV virus as free Vhh. 
Although covalently linked Vhh showed significant binding affinity to gp120, it 
unexpectedly had a lower neutralization potency. This may be due to the 
comparability in size of the viral and liposome particles restricting the number 
which can be bound to the liposome surface so involving only a fraction of the 
antibodies, whereas non-covalently attached antibodies dissociate from the 
surface after acting with gp120 and free the remainder to bind further viruses. 
Covalently conjugated Vhh might also trigger the cellular uptake of a 
liposome-virion complex. To explore the possible ability of the antibody-coated 
liposomes to have a further function, we encapsulated the hydrophobic antiviral 
drug dapivirine into both of the non-covalently and covalently conjugated 
liposome formulations, both of which revealed high efficacy in reducing viral 
replication in vitro. Thus, dual function liposomes may lead to a novel strategy 
for the prophylaxis of HIV/AIDS by combining the neutralizing activity of Vhh 
with antiviral effects of high drug concentrations.

Substantial Life Extension and the Fair Distribution of Healthspans.

Wareham CS(1).

One of the strongest objections to the development and use of substantially 
life-extending interventions is that they would exacerbate existing unjust 
disparities of healthy lifespans between rich and poor members of society. In 
both popular opinion and ethical theory, this consequence is sometimes thought 
to justify a ban on life-prolonging technologies. However, the practical and 
ethical drawbacks of banning receive little attention, and the viability of 
alternative policies is seldom considered. Moreover, where ethicists do propose 
alternatives, there is scant effort to consider their merits in light of 
developing world priorities. In response to these shortcomings, I distinguish 
four policy options and, on the basis of a plausible intuition about fairness, 
evaluate their implications for a fair distribution of healthy lifespans. I 
claim that even in developing nations it would be fairest to favor policies that 
promote equal access to at least one promising category of substantially 
life-extending intervention: calorie restriction mimetics.

The number of people affected by neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease and Parkinson's disease is rapidly increasing owing to the global 
increase in life expectancy. Small molecules with neurotrophic effects have 
great potential for management of these neurological disorders. In this study, 
different (C1-C12) alkyl ester derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) were 
synthesized (a total of 30 compounds). The neurotrophic capacity of the test 
compounds was examined by measuring promotion of survival in serum-deprived 
conditions and enhancement of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite 
outgrowth in PC12 neuronal cells. p-Coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids and 
their esters did not alter cell survival, while caffeic acid and all its alkyl 
esters, especially decyl and dodecyl caffeate, significantly promoted neuronal 
survival at 25 μm. Methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl caffeate esters also 
significantly enhanced NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, among which the most 
effective ones were propyl and butyl esters, which at 5 μm led to 25- and 
22-fold increases in the number of neurites, respectively. The findings of the 
docking study suggested phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) as the potential 
molecular target. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that alkyl esters of 
caffeic acid can be useful as scaffolds for the discovery of therapeutic agents 
for neurodegenerative diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Foot orthoses are commonly prescribed as an intervention for people 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Data relating to the cost-effectiveness of foot 
orthoses in people with RA are limited. The aim was to evaluate the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of two types of foot orthoses in people with established RA.
METHOD: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was undertaken to compare 
custom-made foot orthoses (CMFOs) and simple insoles (SIs) in 41 people with 
established RA. The Foot Function Index (FFI) was used to measure foot pain, 
disability, and functional limitation. Costs were estimated from the perspective 
of the UK National Health Service (NHS), societal (patient and family) 
perspective, and secondary care resource use in terms of the intervention and 
staff time. Effects were assessed in terms of health gain expressed as 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: At baseline, 20 participants received a CMFO and 21 participants 
received an SI. After 16 weeks foot pain improved in both the CMFOs (p = 0.000) 
and the SIs (p < 0.01). However, disability scores improved for CMFOs 
(p < 0.001) but not for SIs (p = 0.40). The cost-effectiveness results 
demonstrated no difference in cost between the arms (CMFOs: £159.10; SIs: 
£79.10; p = 0.35), with the CMFOs being less effective in terms of cost per QALY 
gain (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In people with established RA, semi-rigid customized foot orthoses 
can improve pain and disability scores in comparison to simple insoles. From a 
cost-effectiveness perspective, the customized foot orthoses were far more 
expensive to manufacture, with no significant cost per QALY gain.

OBJECTIVE: To determine which strength training exercises selectively activate 
the biceps femoris long head (BFLongHead) muscle.
METHODS: We recruited 24 recreationally active men for this two-part 
observational study. Part 1: We explored the amplitudes and the ratios of 
lateral (BF) to medial hamstring (MH) normalised electromyography (nEMG) during 
the concentric and eccentric phases of 10 common strength training exercises. 
Part 2: We used functional MRI (fMRI) to determine the spatial patterns of 
hamstring activation during two exercises which (1) most selectively and (2) 
least selectively activated the BF in part 1.
RESULTS: Eccentrically, the largest BF/MH nEMG ratio occurred in the 45° 
hip-extension exercise; the lowest was in the Nordic hamstring (Nordic) and 
bent-knee bridge exercises. Concentrically, the highest BF/MH nEMG ratio 
occurred during the lunge and 45° hip extension; the lowest was during the leg 
curl and bent-knee bridge. fMRI revealed a greater BF(LongHead) to 
semitendinosus activation ratio in the 45° hip extension than the Nordic 
(p<0.001). The T2 increase after hip extension for BFLongHead, semitendinosus 
and semimembranosus muscles was greater than that for BFShortHead (p<0.001). 
During the Nordic, the T2 increase was greater for the semitendinosus than for
