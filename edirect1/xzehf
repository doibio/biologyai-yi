moments. Among the emerging therapies, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) 
is a non-invasive therapeutic intervention used for musculoskeletal disorders, 
several inflammatory tendon diseases, or spasticity. The findings suggest that 
ESWT may be useful in decreasing plantar flexor muscle tone for adults and 
children affected by lower limb spasticity., There are some trials which had 
also showed that radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (rESWT) was more 
effective on augmenting the ankle passive range of motion (PROM) compared to 
focal extracorporeal shockwave therapy (fESWT)., In addition, ESWT proved to be 
effective not only as treatment for lower limb spasticity, but also for gait 
pattern since combined with a conventional physical therapy (CPT) program 
decreased spasticity and improved gait pattern in children with hemiplegic 
cerebral palsy (CP). The findings on ESWT effectiveness for gait pattern 
improvement could open a new paradigm applicable for the research of this 
promising, non-invasive therapy already effective for spasticity management. 
Added to clinical evaluation, the instrumented treadmills serve both as a tool 
for gait training and also for recording and measuring spatiotemporal and 
kinematic parameters, offering objective data for gait analysis, especially 
after treatment delivery., Gait analysis through systems such as instrumented 
treadmills play an important role in clinical practice and clinical trials by 
assessing gait patterns related to various disorders. This type of analysis 
through instrumented treadmills is based on measurements which offer the 
possibility for repeatability. Through the inertial measurement units (IMUs) 
usage it is granted good validity and reliability for mean spatiotemporal 
parameters during gait phases. Although there are trials validating different 
types of 3D cameras for gait analysis on the treadmills and overground, only few 
of them assessed the instrumented treadmills. However, there are gait analysis 
systems which showed good levels of agreement, and added to the clinical 
assessment provide the assessor with objective, real-time data.,, Therefore, the 
aim of this study is to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of rESWT and CPT 
protocol on the gait pattern in stroke survivors through a new gait analysis 
technology. This type of technology encompasses spatiotemporal and kinematic 
parameters, and the findings are correlated with the clinical evaluation, 
offering a global assessment of gait parameters.

Chronic diseases often lead to metabolic disorders, causing anabolic resistance 
and increased energy consumption, which result in cachexia. Cachexia, in turn, 
can lead to major clinical consequences such as impaired quality of life, 
shortened life expectancy, and increased healthcare expenditure. Existing 
international diagnostic criteria for cachexia employ thresholds derived from 
Western populations, which may not apply to Asians due to differing body 
compositions. To address this issue, the Asian Working Group for Cachexia (AWGC) 
was initiated. The AWGC comprises experts in cachexia research and clinical 
practice from various Asian countries and aims to develop a consensus on 
diagnostic criteria and significant clinical outcomes for cachexia in Asia. The 
AWGC, composed of experts in cachexia research and clinical practice from 
several Asian countries, undertook three-round Delphi surveys and five meetings 
to reach a consensus. Discussions were held on etiological diseases, essential 
diagnostic items for cachexia, including subjective and objective symptoms and 
biomarkers, and significant clinical outcomes. The consensus highlighted the 
importance of multiple diagnostic factors for cachexia, including chronic 
diseases, either or both weight loss or low body mass index, and at least one of 
the following: anorexia, decreased grip strength (<28 kg in men and <18 kg in 
women), or elevated C-reactive protein levels (>5 mg/L [0.5 mg/dL]). The AWGC 
proposed a significant weight change of 2% or more over a 3-6 month period and 
suggested a tentative cut-off value of 21 kg/m2 for low body mass index in 
diagnosing cachexia. Critical clinical outcomes were determined to be mortality, 
quality of life as assessed by tools such as EQ-5D or the Functional Assessment 
of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy, and functional status as measured by the Clinical 
Frailty Scale or Barthel Index, with significant emphasis on patient-reported 
outcomes. The AWGC consensus offers a comprehensive definition and user-friendly 
diagnostic criteria for cachexia, tailored specifically for Asian populations. 
This consensus is set to stimulate future research and enhance the 
multidisciplinary approach to managing cachexia. With plans to develop further 
guidelines for the optimal treatment, prevention, and care of cachexia in 
Asians, the AWGC criteria are expected to drive research across chronic 
co-morbidities and cancer in Asia, leading to future refinement of diagnostic 
criteria.

Aim: Clinical trials and real-world data for Type 2 diabetes have shown that 
real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) lowers glycated hemoglobin 
(A1c) and reduces hypoglycemia relative to self-monitoring of blood glucose 
(SMBG). This analysis examined the long-term health and economic outcomes 
associated with using rt-CGM versus SMBG in people with insulin-treated Type 2 
diabetes in Canada. Materials & methods: Clinical data were sourced from a 
real-world study, in which rt-CGM reduced A1C by 0.56% versus continued SMBG. 
The analysis was performed using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model, from a Canadian 
payer perspective over a lifetime horizon for a cohort aged 65 years with an A1C 
of 8.3% at baseline. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 1.5% 
annually. Results: Projected total mean lifetime costs were CAD 207,466 for 
rt-CGM versus CAD 189,863 for SMBG (difference: CAD 17,602) and projected mean 
quality-adjusted life expectancy was 9.97 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
for rt-CGM versus 9.02 QALYs for SMBG (difference: 0.95 QALYs), resulting in an 
incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of CAD 18,523 per QALY gained for rt-CGM 
versus SMBG. Findings were sensitive to changes in the A1C treatment effect, 
annual cost and quality of life benefit associated with using rt-CGM, SMBG 
frequency, and baseline age, but ICURs remained below CAD 50,000 per QALY in all 
analyses. Conclusion: For people in Canada with insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes 
and poor glycemic control, use of rt-CGM is likely to be cost-effective relative 
to SMBG.

A growing divide: Trends in social inequalities in healthy longevity in 
Australia, 2001-20.

This study examines two decades of change in social inequalities in life and 
health expectancy among older adults in Australia, one of the few countries that 
escaped an economic recession during the global financial crisis. We compare 
adults aged 45+ across three measures of individual socio-economic 
position-education, occupation, and household wealth-and use multistate life 
tables to estimate total life expectancy (TLE) and life expectancy free of 
limiting long-term illness (LLTI-free LE) based on 20 waves of the Household, 
Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (2001-20). Our findings highlight 
substantial social disparities in both TLE and LLTI-free LE in Australia. 
Grouping individuals by household wealth shows striking differentials in 
LLTI-free LE. We observe widening social disparities in healthy longevity over 
time by all three measures of socio-economic position. This diverging trend in 
healthy longevity is troubling against the backdrop of widening income and 
wealth inequalities in Australia.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota plays a significant role in host survival, health, 
and diseases; however, compared to other livestock, research on the gut 
microbiome of donkeys is limited.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 30 donkey samples of rectal contents from six 
regions, including Shigatse, Changdu, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Dezhou, 
were collected for metagenomic sequencing. The results of the species annotation 
revealed that the dominant phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and the 
dominant genera were Bacteroides, unclassified_o_Clostridiales (short for 
Clostridiales) and unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae (short for Lachnospiraceae). 
The dominant phyla, genera and key discriminators were Bacteroidetes, 
Clostridiales and Bacteroidetes in Tibet donkeys (Shigatse); Firmicutes, 
Clostridiales and Clostridiales in Tibet donkeys (Changdu); Firmicutes, 
Fibrobacter and Tenericutes in Qinghai donkeys; Firmicutes, Clostridiales and 
Negativicutes in Yunnan donkeys; Firmicutes, Fibrobacter and Fibrobacteres in 
Xinjiang donkeys; Firmicutes, Clostridiales and Firmicutes in Dezhou donkeys. In 
the functional annotation, it was mainly enriched in the glycolysis and 
gluconeogenesis of carbohydrate metabolism, and the abundance was the highest in 
Dezhou donkeys. These results combined with altitude correlation analysis 
demonstrated that donkeys in the Dezhou region exhibited strong 
glucose-conversion ability, those in the Shigatse region exhibited strong 
glucose metabolism and utilization ability, those in the Changdu region 
exhibited a strong microbial metabolic function, and those in the Xinjiang 
region exhibited the strongest ability to decompose cellulose and hemicellulose.
CONCLUSION: According to published literature, this is the first study to 
construct a dataset with multi-regional donkey breeds. Our study revealed the 
differences in the composition and function of gut microbes in donkeys from 
different geographic regions and environmental settings and is valuable for 
donkey gut microbiome research.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have investigated the association between 
cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD), but evidence of 
the attributable burden of individual and combined cardiometabolic risk factors 
for CVD and mortality is limited. We aimed to investigate and quantify the 
associations and population attributable fraction (PAF) of cardiometabolic risk 
factors on CVD and all-cause mortality, and calculate the loss of CVD-free years 
and years of life lost in relation to the presence of cardiometabolic risk 
factors.
METHODS: Twenty-two thousand five hundred ninety-six participants aged ≥ 35 
without CVD at baseline were included between October 2012 and December 2015. 
The outcomes were the composite of fatal and nonfatal CVD events and all-cause 
mortality, which were followed up in 2018 and 2019 and ascertained by hospital 
records and death certificates. Cox regression was applied to evaluate the 
association of individual and combined cardiometabolic risk factors (including 
hypertension, diabetes and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)) 
with CVD risk and all-cause mortality. We also described the PAF for CVD and 
reductions in CVD-free years and life expectancy associated with different 
combination of cardiometabolic conditions.
RESULTS: During the 4.92 years of follow-up, we detected 991 CVD events and 1126 
deaths. Hazard ratio were 1.59 (95% confidential interval (CI) 1.37-1.85), 1.82 
(95%CI 1.49-2.24) and 2.97 (95%CI 1.85-4.75) for CVD and 1.38 (95%CI 1.20-1.58), 
1.66 (95%CI 1.37-2.02) and 2.97 (95%CI 1.88-4.69) for all-cause mortality, 
respectively, in participants with one, two or three cardiometabolic risk 
factors compared with participants without diabetes, hypertension, and high 
LDL-C. 21.48% of CVD and 15.38% of all-cause mortality were attributable to the 
combined effect of diabetes and hypertension. Participants aged between 40 and 
60 years old, with three cardiometabolic disorders, had approximately 4.3-year 
reductions life expectancy compared with participants without any abnormalities 
of cardiometabolic disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiometabolic risk factors were associated with a multiplicative 
risk of CVD incidence and all-cause mortality, highlighting the importance of 
comprehensive management for hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia in the 
prevention of CVD.

Benefits of deprescribing for older people with frailty and polypharmacy: part 
one.

Lyne S(1).

The UK population is ageing rapidly, a trend that is likely to continue due to 
improvements in chronic disease management and increased life expectancy. 
Comorbidities, including frailty, become increasingly common with age and as a 
result it is likely that multiple medicines will be prescribed for older people, 
leading to polypharmacy. This is a concern because polypharmacy is associated 
with various adverse effects and an increased medicine burden in this 
population, as well as a financial burden for the healthcare system. This 
article, the first of two parts, explains the physiology of ageing and frailty, 
and considers the adverse effects of polypharmacy on older people with frailty, 
using a fictional case study to illustrate this. Part two will use the case 
study to explore the use of medication reviews and deprescribing benefits as 
part of medicines optimisation.

INTRODUCTION: In the past decade, unmanned aerial spraying systems (UASS) have 
emerged as an effective crop treatment platform option, competing with other 
ground vehicle treatments. The development of this platform has provided an 
effective spraying system that can be used on all crop types and in all weather 
conditions. However, related research has not been able to develop a UASS that 
can be operated in windy conditions with a low drift percentage.
METHODS: In this research, spraying was simulated in an indoor flight simulator 
by considering flight speed, altitude, wind speed, wind direction, rotor 
rotation, interval, spraying pattern, and nozzle type, which were used as the 
parameters affecting the output value of the coefficient of variation (CV) of 
spraying. These parameters were referenced as properties that occur in the 
field, and using machine learning methods, the CV value was used as a dataset to 
develop a model that can execute pump opening by controlling the flow rate. 
There are four machine learning methods used, i.e. random forest regression, 
gradient boosting, ada boost, and automatic relevance determination regression 
which are compared with simple linear regression and ridge regression as linear 
regression.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the random forest regression model was the 
most accurate, with R2 of 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.04%. The 
developed model was used to simulate spraying with pump opening A, which 
connects two nozzles in front, and pump opening AB, which connects all four 
nozzles.
DISCUSSION: Using the logic based on CV value and pesticide quantity, the model 
can execute the pump opening against the environment and UASS operation.

BACKGROUND: The VICTORIA trial (Vericiguat Global Study in Subjects With Heart 
Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) demonstrated that, in patients with 
high-risk heart failure, vericiguat reduced the primary composite outcome of 
cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization relative to placebo. The 
hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.84-1.07). In a 
prespecified analysis, treatment effects varied substantially as a function of 
baseline NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels, with 
survival benefit for vericiguat in the lower NT-proBNP quartiles (hazard ratio, 
0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.97]) and no benefit in the highest NT-proBNP quartile 
(hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.95-1.38]). An economic analysis was a major 
secondary objective of the VICTORIA research program.
METHODS: Medical resource use data were collected for all VICTORIA patients 
(N=5050). Costs were estimated by applying externally derived US cost weights to 
resource use counts. Life expectancy was projected from patient-level empirical 
trial survival results with the use of age-based survival modeling methods. 
Quality-of-life adjustments were based on prospectively collected EQ-5D-based 
utilities. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
comparing vericiguat with placebo, assessed from the US health care sector 
perspective over a lifetime horizon. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using the 
total VICTORIA cohort, both with and without interaction between treatment and 
baseline NT-proBNP.
RESULTS: Life expectancy modeling results varied according to whether the 
observed heterogeneity of treatment effect by baseline NT-proBNP values was 
incorporated into the modeling. Including the interaction term, the vericiguat 
arm had an estimated quality-adjusted life expectancy of 4.56 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) compared with 4.13 QALYs for placebo (incremental discounted 
QALY, 0.43). Without the treatment heterogeneity/interaction term, vericiguat 
had 4.50 QALYs compared with 4.33 QALYs for placebo (incremental discounted 
QALY, 0.17). Incremental discounted costs (vericiguat minus placebo) were 
$28 546 with the treatment interaction and $20 948 without it. Corresponding 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $66 509 per QALY allowing for 
treatment heterogeneity and $124 512 without heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: Vericiguat use in the VICTORIA trial met criteria for intermediate 
value, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates were sensitive to 
whether the analysis accounted for observed NT-proBNP treatment effect 
heterogeneity. The cost-effectiveness of vericiguat was driven by the projected 
incremental life expectancy among patients in the lowest 3 quartiles of 
NT-proBNP.

Over the past 50 years, socioeconomic development has brought a reduction in 
birth rates, an increase in life expectancy and consequently in the elderly 
population. For this reason, there has been an increasing focus on physical and 
mental health of the elderly, promoting the concept of healthy aging. The aim of 
this study was to explore the associations between perceived physical and mental 
health of older adults and a variety of determinants, such as demographic 
factors, physical functional fitness, physical activity level, adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet and anthropometric indices, through a structural equation 
modeling (SEM). A cross-sectional observational study involved 208 elderly (24 
men and 184 women) over the age of 60, fully independent and autonomous. 
Perceived physical and mental health were assessed with the Short Form 12 
questionnaire. Basic sociodemographic information was collected; anthropometric 
features were directly measured, functional fitness was assessed with the Senior 
Fitness Test, and physical activity level was determined through the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire; adherence to Mediterranean Diet 
(MD) was also collected through the MEDAS questionnaire. The SEM analysis 
revealed that functional fitness, which was a latent variable of the model 
described by the six administered fitness tests, was a strong predictor both of 
perceived physical and perceived mental health in the sample of elderly. 
Physical activity level was as predictor of the perceived physical component, 
but not of the mental health, while score of metabolic equivalent task did not 
result a predictor, as well as the sociodemographic factors and adherence to MD. 
The present findings suggest that it would be strongly recommended for elderly 
subjects to engage in physical activity specifically targeted to aged 
populations, in order to enhance their fitness abilities and enable them to 
improve the perception of their own health status.

One-Pot Enzymatic Preparation of Oligonucleotides with an Expanded Genetic 
Alphabet via Controlled Pause and Restart of Primer Extension: Making Unnatural 
Out of Natural.

The genetic alphabet of life has been dramatically expanded via the development 
of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) that work as efficiently as natural base pairs in 
the storage and retrieval of genetic information. Among the most predominant 
UBPs, dNaM-dTPT3 and its analogues have been successfully employed to build 
semisynthetic cells with a functional six-letter genome. With the rapidly 
growing applications of UBPs in vitro and in vivo, there is an ever-increasing 
demand for DNA oligonucleotides containing unnatural bases (UBs) at desired 
positions. Conventional solid-phase synthesis of oligonucleotides has intrinsic 
limitations and needs to use unstable unnatural phosphoramidites and a DNA 
synthesizer, so it does not meet the daily urgent requirement for a few 
UB-containing DNA oligonucleotides in the laboratory. In this work, we develop a 
one-pot enzymatic method for preparing dNaM- or dTPT3-containing DNA 
oligonucleotides via controlled pause and restart of primer extension mediated 
by Klenow fragment (exo-). By systematic optimization of the reaction 
conditions, high efficiencies and product purities have been achieved. The 
universality of this method for preparing DNA oligonucleotides containing dNaM 
or dTPT3 in different sequence contexts is also demonstrated. This method allows 
convenient production of an arbitrary UB-containing DNA oligonucleotide in a 
single test tube with only two natural DNA oligonucleotides, stable nucleoside 
triphosphates, Klenow fragment (exo-), and other common reagents in the 
laboratory, providing the lowest cost and the highest simplicity for the 
enzymatic preparation of UB-containing oligonucleotides. Clearly, this method 
has great potential to facilitate the in vitro and in vivo applications of the 
UBPs.

The use of pesticides plays an essential role in improving crop quality and 
yield, however, it causes air, water, and soil pollution and the residue of 
these pesticides in agricultural products threatens the ecosystem and human 
life. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop rapid, simple, and 
cost-effective methods for regular monitoring of pesticide residues in 
agricultural products especially strawberry that is consumed fresh and unpeeled. 
In this study, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of varying sizes have been exploited 
as sensing units to design a non-enzymatic colorimetric sensor array for the 
detection and discrimination of various pesticides including; bifenazate (BF), 
paraquat (PQ), diazinon (DZ), thiometon (TM), and carbendazim (CD) and 
chlorpyrifos (CP). Because of their strong size- and environmentally-dependent 
properties, AuNPs with different sizes produced distinguished plasmonic patterns 
in the presence of pesticides at a vast range of concentrations 
(25-800 ng mL-1). Plasmonic patterns of sensor units have been analyzed by 
various data visualization (bar plots and heat maps) and pattern recognition 
methods (linear discriminant analysis (LDA)). The multivariate calibrations 
showed linear responses ranging from 50 to 800 ng mL-1 for carbendazim, 
chlorpyrifos, paraquat, and bifenazate and 25-800 ng mL-1 for diazinon and 
thiometon. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 17.7, 22.8, 22.4, 
9.7, 7.4, and 23.8 ng mL-1 for carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, paraquat, diazinon, 
thiometon, and bifenazate respectively. Finally, the applicability of the 
designed sensor was evaluated in real samples comprising tap water, well water, 
soil, and fruit, leave, drainage water, and culture substrate of strawberry.

In this study, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), curcumin (Cur), and graphene oxide 
(GO) were used to prepare a novel biocomposite film (CMC-Cur-GO). A central 
composite design under response surface methodology was employed to optimize the 
films in terms of water vapor permeability (WVP) and swelling percentage (SP). 
Under the optimum conditions, which the rates of CMC, GO and curcumin were found 
to be 1350 mg, 29.99 mg, and 0.302 g, respectively, WVP and SP of CMC-Cur-GO 
were obtained 0.902 × 10-8 (g/m·h·Pa) and 13.62 %, respectively. The 
biocomposite films (CMC, CMC-Cur, CMC-GO and CMC-Cur-GO) were characterized by 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron 
microscope, thermal gravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis, 
ultraviolet-vis light transmittance, moisture content, and mechanical 
properties. Compared with pure CMC film, the tensile strength, elongation at 
break and Young's modulus of CMC-Cur-GO were significantly improved by up to 
75 %, 41 % and 23 %, respectively (p < 0.05). Then, CMC-Cur-GO was applied as a 
coating solution for the shrimps. The coated shrimps with the CMC-Cur-GO 
significantly (p < 0.05) showed a noteworthy improvement in microbial quality 
(total and psychrotrophic bacterial count), chemical deterioration and lipid 
oxidation (pH and total volatile basic nitrogen, peroxide value and 
thiobarbituric acid) and physical characteristic (weight loss) as compared to 
other samples. The CMC-Cur-GO coating could increase the shelf life of shrimp 
under refrigerated storage.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of Bacillus aryabhattai (LSG3-7) and 
Bacillus mojavensis (LSG3-8) on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and 
immune response in Rhynchocypris lagowskii (Dybowski, 1869), at the trial and 
challenge periods. A 630 healthy fish (10.76 ± 0.05) were randomly divided into 
six groups: control group (D1) was fed the basal diet, D2 and D3 were 
supplemented with LSG 3-7 and LSG3-8 (1 × 108 CFU/g) for both of them, whereas 
D4 was supplemented with a mixture of both bacteria (0.5 × 108 CFU/g each), and 
D5 was supplemented with LSG3-7 0.75 × 108 CFU/g + LSG3-8 0.25 × 108 CFU/g, and 
D6 supplemented with LSG3-7 0.25 × 108 CFU/g + LSG3-8 0.75 × 108 CFU/g. After 
the trial, Aeromonas hydrophila was used in a challenge test for 14 days. 
Treatments showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in growth performance and 
antioxidant capacity (CAT, CuZn-SOD, GPX) in the liver and intestine compared to 
the control. The antioxidant-related genes CAT, CuZn-SOD, GPX, and Nrf2 in the 
liver and intestine showed upregulation compared with the control group. Serum 
IgM, LZM, C3, C4, and AKP showed a favorable superiority (p < 0.05) in 
treatments (D2 - D6) at the trial and challenge test compared to controls. In 
parallel, immune-related genes (IgM, NF-κB, TLR-1, TLR-2, and MyD88) showed an 
up-regulated level (p < 0.05) in treatments (D2 - D6) compared to the control. 
In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α) showed a downregulated 
level in treatments (D2 - D6). After the challenge test, the immune-related 
genes in the liver and muscle showed an up-regulated level in treatments 
compared to the controls. The survival rate showed a significant increase 
(p < 0.05) in the treatment groups (D2 - D6) compared to the control. Overall, 
individuals and the bacterial mixture of B. aryabhattai and B. mojavensis could 
improve the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immune capacity, and 
survival rate of R. lagowskii and prevent side effects of A. hydrophila. 
However, B. mojavensis showed a slight improvement compared to B. aryabhattai 
without a significant difference between them.

PURPOSE: People living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) developed 
higher life expectancy along with chronic bone disease over the past years. Our 
purpose is to evaluate bone mineral density, bone microarchitecture and 
fractures in young PLWH and understand the disease's contribution to bone 
derangements and fracture risk.
METHODS: Eighty-one HIV-infected and 54 control young (20-50 years) male and 
female subjects were enrolled in this study. Methods for patient evaluation 
included DXA-VFA (dual energy X-rays and vertebral fracture assessment), HR-pQCT 
(high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography), biochemistry and 
FRAX.
RESULTS: Fifty participants from each group completed all exams. Median age was 
40 (25-49) vs. 36.5 (22-50) for the HIV and control groups, respectively (p 
0.120). Ethnicity, body mass index, serum phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH 
and CTX were similar between groups, although ALP and OC suggested higher bone 
turnover in PLWH. VFA identified morphometric vertebral fractures in 12% of 
PLWH. PLWH had lower values for lumbar spine areal BMD and Z score, volumetric 
BMD, trabecular bone fraction (BV/TV) and trabecular number measured at the 
distal tibia by HR-pQCT; as a consequence, trabecular separation and 
heterogeneity were higher (all p < 0.05). The FRAX-estimated risk for hip and 
major osteoporotic fractures was statistically higher in PLWH (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm severe bone impairment and fractures associated 
with HIV in young patients. Thus, we developed a screening protocol for young 
PLWH to detect bone fragility, reduce skeletal disease progression and 
morbimortality, decrease fracture risk, and increase quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a minimally invasive 
procedure that has been demonstrated in the MERIT randomised, controlled trial 
to result in substantial and durable additional weight loss in adults with 
obesity compared with lifestyle modification (LM) alone. We sought to conduct 
the first cost-effectiveness analysis of ESG versus LM alone in adults with 
class II obesity (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2) from a national healthcare system 
perspective in England based on results from this study.
METHODS: A 6-state Markov model was developed comprising 5 BMI-based health 
states and an absorbing death state. Baseline characteristics, utilities, and 
transition probabilities were informed by patient-level data from the subset of 
patients with class II obesity in MERIT. Adverse events (AEs) were based on the 
MERIT safety population. Mortality was estimated by applying BMI-specific hazard 
ratios from the published literature to UK general population mortality rates. 
Utilities for the healthy weight and overweight health states were informed from 
the literature; disutility associated with increasing BMI in the class I-III 
obesity health states was estimated using MERIT utility data. Disutility due to 
AEs and the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities were based on the 
literature. Costs included intervention costs, AE costs, and comorbidity costs.
RESULTS: ESG resulted in higher overall costs than LM alone but led to an 
increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ESG vs LM alone was £2453/QALY gained. ESG 
was consistently cost effective across a wide range of sensitivity analyses, 
with no ICER estimate exceeding £10,000/QALY gained. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, the mean ICER was £2502/QALY gained and ESG remained cost 
effective in 98.25% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of
