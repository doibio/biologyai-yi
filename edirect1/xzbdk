This study evaluated the impact of the elimination of certain chronic illnesses 
on disability-free life expectancy in the elderly population. This was a 
cross-sectional survey based on official data from the city of São Paulo, 
Brazil, in 2000, and from the SABE study. Cause-deleted probabilities of dying 
were derived with the cause-elimination life-table technique. Eliminated 
diseases that generated the largest increase in disability-free life expectancy 
in women were heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (in that 
order). In men, eliminated diseases that generated the largest increase in 
disability-free life expectancy were, at 60 years, heart disease, hypertension, 
and falls, and at 75 years of age, heart disease, hypertension, and chronic lung 
disease. Classification of chronic diseases according to impact on 
disability-free life expectancy can assist the planning of preventive programs 
and health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Observation is underutilized among men with localized, low-risk 
prostate cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and benefits of observation versus initial 
treatment.
DESIGN: Decision analysis simulating treatment or observation.
DATA SOURCES: Medicare schedules, published literature.
TARGET POPULATION: Men aged 65 and 75 years who had newly diagnosed low-risk 
prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen level <10 µg/L, stage ≤T2a, Gleason 
score ≤3 + 3).
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal.
INTERVENTION: Treatment (brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, 
or radical prostatectomy) or observation (active surveillance [AS] or watchful 
waiting [WW]).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Observation was more effective and less costly 
than initial treatment. Compared with AS, WW provided 2 additional months of 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.02 vs. 8.85 years) at a savings of $15,374 
($24,520 vs. $39,894) in men aged 65 years and 2 additional months (6.14 vs. 
5.98 years) at a savings of $11,746 ($18,302 vs. $30,048) in men aged 75 years. 
Brachytherapy was the most effective and least expensive initial treatment.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Treatment became more effective than 
observation when it led to more dramatic reductions in prostate cancer death 
(hazard ratio, 0.47 vs. WW and 0.64 vs. AS). Active surveillance became as 
effective as WW in men aged 65 years when the probability of progressing to 
treatment on AS decreased below 63% or when the quality of life with AS versus 
WW was 4% higher in men aged 65 years or 1% higher in men aged 75 years. 
Watchful waiting remained least expensive in all analyses.
LIMITATION: Results depend on outcomes reported in the published literature, 
which is limited.
CONCLUSION: Among these men, observation is more effective and costs less than 
initial treatment, and WW is most effective and least expensive under a wide 
range of clinical scenarios.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate transition probabilities between disability states, total 
life expectancy, and the latter's decomposition into years spent disabled and 
disability-free by age, sex, and education among older adults in São Paulo, 
Brazil, and urban areas in Mexico.
METHODS: Applied a micro-simulation method (Interpolative Markov Chains) using 
longitudinal data.
RESULTS: We found large between-country educational differences in incidence of 
and recovery from disability with higher rates in Mexico than in São Paulo, but 
no differences in mortality. Older adults in Mexico spent longer time being 
disability-free than in São Paulo for both levels of education. Males and 
females in São Paulo spent a larger fraction of their remaining life disabled at 
every age than their counterparts in urban areas in Mexico.
DISCUSSION: There were educational differences in the prevalence of disability 
in São Paulo and urban areas in Mexico, and significant educational differences 
in disability incidence and recovery across sites.

University, Hefei, Anhui, China.

Hip fracture incidence rates in Hefei, China, over a period of 1 year (2010) 
were assessed. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and 
epidemiology of hip fracture in Hefei and compare it with other populations. All 
the hip fracture records were obtained from the Hefei Hospital Discharge 
Register for the entire population ≥50 years of age and restricted to cervical 
or trochanteric types. The incidence of hip fracture was standardized to the 
2010 World population. A total of 1518 (aged ≥50) hip fractures (628 in men, 890 
in women) were recorded during the study period. The age-adjusted incidence rate 
for 1 year was 144/100,000 (95 % CI = 135-153/100,000) for women and 97/100,000 
(95 % CI = 85-109/100,000) for men. The standardized incidence rate against the 
2010 World population was 151.7/100,000 for women and 98.2/100,000 for men. The 
mean age of patients with a hip fracture was 74.5 ± 10.1 years for women and 
71.9 ± 11.9 years for men. The overall female to male ratio of hip fracture was 
1.48:1 for hip fracture incidence and 1.54:1 for standardized incidence. Simple 
fall accounted for 85 % hip fractures in total cases. Hefei has a lower 
incidence of hip fracture compared with Beijing and other countries from the 
five continents in recent studies, but a higher incidence than those cities in 
north-east China in the early 1990s. The inequality incidence in different 
geographic areas could be due to the urbanization or life expectancy of the 
population, but further investigation needs to be done to confirm this 
hypothesis. We also found a higher incidence in women than in men. Simple fall 
may be the main mechanism of injury for hip fracture.

The average age at which women are first diagnosed with HIV is increasing and, 
due to advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), women are living with HIV for 
longer. Once regarded as a fatal disease of young males, HIV is now considered a 
lifelong chronic condition affecting both men and women into older age. This 
raises questions for the long-term management of women living with HIV in 
Europe, such as how age affects the ART response, what the consequences are of 
long-term ART, and whether the comorbidities of ageing and menopause are 
different in women with HIV compared with men or uninfected women. 
Non-AIDS-related events, such as cancer, are increasingly responsible for the 
deaths of women with HIV, and European guidelines now recommend that they 
undergo regular screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer, and 
vaccination for human papillomavirus. The other major outcome of the greater 
life expectancy of women living with HIV is that a greater number are reaching 
menopause. Some studies suggest that HIV infection is linked with earlier onset 
of menopause and altered menopausal symptomatology. Many questions remain, and 
there is a need for more studies addressing ageing and sustained ART use in 
women living with HIV in Europe.

BACKGROUND: and
OBJECTIVE: Asymptomatic stenosis of the carotid arteries is associated with 
stroke. Carotid revascularization can reduce the future risk of stroke but can 
also trigger an immediate stroke. The objective was to model the generic 
relationship between immediate risk, long-term benefit, and life expectancy for 
any one-time prophylactic treatment and then apply the model to the use of 
revascularization in the management of asymptomatic carotid disease.
METHODS: In the "payoff time" framework, the possibility of losing 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) because of revascularization failure is 
conceptualized as an "investment" that is eventually recouped over time, on 
average. Using this framework, we developed simple mathematical forms that 
define relationships between the following: perioperative probability of stroke 
(P); annual stroke rate without revascularization (r0); annual stroke rate after 
revascularization, conditional on not having suffered perioperative stroke (r1); 
utility levels assigned to the asymptomatic state (ua) and stroke state (us); 
and mortality rates (λ).
RESULTS: In patients whose life expectancy is below a critical life expectancy 
(CLE = P/(1-P)r0-r1, the "investment" will never pay off, and revascularization 
will lead to loss of QALYs, on average. CLE is independent of utilities assigned 
to the health states if a rank ordering exists in which ua > us. For clinically 
relevant values (P = 3%, r0 = 1%, r1 = 0.5%), the CLE is approximately 6.4 
years, which is longer than published guidelines regarding patient selection for 
revascularization.
CONCLUSIONS: In managing asymptomatic carotid disease, the payoff time framework 
specifies a CLE beneath which patients, on average, will not benefit from 
revascularization. This formula is suitable for clinical use at the patient's 
bedside and can account for patient variability, the ability of clinicians who 
perform revascularization, and the particular revascularization technology that 
is chosen.

[Ecological and biological characteristics of Drosophila melanogaster features 
depending on the dose of electromagnetic radiation of various types].

[Article in Russian]

Babkina VV, Chernova GV, Allenova EA, Endebera OP, Naumkina EN.

Biological effects of exposure to red light (lambda = 660 +/- 10 nm) on the 
viability and morphophysiological characteristics of Drosophila melanogaster 
have been studied. The ability of this physical agent to modify these features 
is shown. The degree of expression and impact of biological effects depend on 
the dose, functional and genetic status of the organism. The study of the life 
expectancy of the exposed to EHF and white light D. melanogaster has revealed 
that expression of the features depends on the radiation doses, genotype, sex, 
the nature of the position of wings and lighting conditions. It has been found 
that the dark mode (24 h-night) is more favorable than the artificial lighting. 
Individuals with the left wing at the top are more sensitive to the external 
factors.

This work studies for first time the effect of constant temperatures (15, 20, 
25, 30 and 3 degrees C) on the demography of Anarsia lineatella Zeller 
(Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) based on jackknife and bootstrap randomization 
methods. Male and female longevity was substantially reduced at the higher 
temperatures in contrast to intermediate and lower temperatures. According to a 
second order polynomial regression function, high correlations were observed 
between temperatures and the age of first reproduction as well as temperature 
and oviposition times. Net reproductive rate was highest at 25 degrees C and 
74.172, while the intrinsic rate of increase displayed its highest values at 30 
degrees C and was estimated to be 0.238. Birth rate and finite capacity of 
increase were higher at 30 degrees C and estimated to be 0.235 and 1.268, 
respectively. Mean generation time and doubling time varied significantly with 
temperature and the shortest mean generation and doubling time was obtained at 
30 degrees C (25.566 and 2.909 d respectively). Life expectancy had its lowest 
value 10.3 d at 25 degrees C, whereas cohorts that were maintained at 20 and 15 
degrees C increased their life expectation approximately three to sixfold.

BACKGROUND: To further evaluate the association between formaldehyde and 
leukemia, we extended follow-up through 2008 for a cohort mortality study of 
11,043 US formaldehyde-exposed garment workers.
METHODS: We computed standardized mortality ratios and standardized rate ratios 
stratified by year of first exposure, exposure duration, and time since first 
exposure. Associations between exposure duration and rates of leukemia and 
myeloid leukemia were further examined using Poisson regression models.
RESULTS: Compared to the US population, myeloid leukemia mortality was elevated 
but overall leukemia mortality was not. In internal analyses, overall leukemia 
mortality increased with increasing exposure duration and this trend was 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: We continue to see limited evidence of an association between 
formaldehyde and leukemia. However, the extended follow-up did not strengthen 
previously observed associations. In addition to continued epidemiologic 
research, we recommend further research to evaluate the biological plausibility 
of a causal relation between formaldehyde and leukemia.

Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The presence of excess skin after massive weight loss, particularly 
in the thighs, not only contributes to a negative body image but can also lead 
to functional deficits in mobility. In the present study, we quantified the 
health state utility of living with excess skin in the thighs in an attempt to 
objectively establish the burden on the quality of life in patients living with 
excess thigh skin laxity.
METHOD: Using visual analog scale (VAS), time trade-off (TTO), and standard 
gamble (SG), we compared the utility outcome scores for thigh skin excess with 
monocular and binocular blindness from a prospective sample of medical students 
and the general population. Utility scores were compared using paired t test. 
Linear regression was performed using age, race, and education as independent 
predictors of each of the utility scores.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four prospective participants were enrolled during a 
6-month period, and 112 participants met our inclusion criteria. The utility 
outcome scores for thigh lift (VAS, TTO, and SG, 0.77 ± 0.15, 0.90 ± 0.11, and 
0.89 ± 0.14, respectively) were statistically different from binocular blindness 
(VAS, TTO, and SG, 0.37 ± 0.18, 0.70 ± 0.23, and 0.70 ± 0.26; P < 0.001), but 
other than VAS (0.67 ± 0.15, P < 0.001), similar to monocular blindness (TTO and 
SG, 0.89 ± 0.13 and 0.81 ± 0.14, respectively; P > 0.05). SG (0.89 ± 0.14 vs 
0.97 ± 0.02, P = 0.003) and TTO (0.89 ± 0.11 vs 0.95 ± 0.03, P = 0.038) were 
different between general population and medical students, respectively, 
corresponding to 3.96 versus 1.80 potential years willing to be traded (P < 
0.05). Additionally, SG was higher in whites versus nonwhites who were willing 
to take a potential 8% chance of mortality compared to 15%, respectively (P = 
0.001), to achieve "perfect" health.
CONCLUSIONS: We have objectified the utility of living with thigh deformity 
after massive weight loss. Our sample population if faced with the condition was 
willing to sacrifice a potential 3.6 years of life and potentially undergo a 
procedure with 11% chance of mortality to address excess thigh laxity.

BACKGROUND: Women require balanced, high-quality information when making an 
informed decision on screening benefits and harms before attending biennial 
mammographic screening.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cumulative risk of a false-positive recall and/or 
(small) screen-detected or interval cancer over 13 consecutive screening 
examinations for women aged 50 from the start of screening were estimated using 
data from the Nijmegen programme, the Netherlands.
RESULTS: Women who underwent 13 successive screens in the period 1975-1976 had a 
5.3% cumulative chance of a screen-detected cancer, with a 4.2% risk of at least 
one false-positive recall. The risk of being diagnosed with interval cancer was 
3.7%. Two decades later, these estimates were 6.9%, 7.3% and 2.9%, respectively. 
The chance of detection of a small, favourable invasive breast cancer, 
anticipating a normal life-expectancy, rose from 2.3% to 3.7%. Extrapolation to 
digital screening mammography indicates that the proportion of false-positive 
results will rise to 16%.
CONCLUSION: Dutch women about to participate in the screening programme can be 
reassured that the chance of false-positive recall in the Netherlands is 
relatively low. A new screening policy and improved mammography have increased 
the detection of an early screening carcinoma and lowering the risk of interval 
carcinoma.

Acromegaly is a chronic disease caused by the excessive secretion of growth 
hormone (GH), and as a result, of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). 
Untreated, the condition reduces the patients' life expectancy and leads to a 
series of complications, among which an increased risk of carcinogenesis is 
considered most important. This paper is an analysis of the publications on the 
issue of the formation of neoplasms, both malignant and benign, in acromegalic 
patients. Although the influence of acromegaly on carcinogenesis remains 
controversial, a number of studies indicate that the frequency of developing 
tumors in this patient group is higher. Moreover, numerous publications 
particularly stress the increased risk of developing neoplasms in patients who 
had been untreated for a long period of time and show elevated levels of GH and 
IGF-1. Consequently, a quick diagnosis and the implementation of effective 
treatment play a key role in the management of this disease.

The formation of an activated cis-3-cyclohexylpropenoic acid by Plm1, the first 
extension module of the phoslactomycin polyketide synthase, is proposed to occur 
through an L-3-hydroxyacyl-intermediate as a result of ketoreduction by an 
A-type ketoreductase (KR). Here, we demonstrate that the KR domain of Plm1 
(PlmKR1) catalyzes the formation of an L-3-hydroxyacyl product. The crystal 
structure of PlmKR1 revealed a well-ordered active site with a nearby Trp 
residue characteristic of A-type KRs. Structural comparison of PlmKR1 with 
B-type KRs that produce D-3-hydroxyacyl intermediates revealed significant 
differences. The active site of cofactor-bound A-type KRs is in a 
catalysis-ready state, whereas cofactor-bound B-type KRs are in a precatalytic 
state. Furthermore, the closed lid loop in substrate-bound A-type KRs restricts 
active site access from all but one direction, which is proposed to control the 
stereochemistry of ketoreduction.

Over the past five decades, two successive waves of political reform have 
brought democracy to, first, Spain, Portugal and Greece, and, more recently, 
Central and Eastern European countries. We assessed whether democratization was 
associated with improvements in population health, as indicated by life 
expectancy and cause-specific mortality rates. Data on life expectancy at birth, 
age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates, levels of democracy 
and potential time-variant confounding variables were collected from harmonized 
international databanks. In two pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses with 
country-fixed effects, life expectancy and cause-specific mortality were 
regressed on measures of current and cumulative democracy, controlling for 
confounders. A first analysis covered the 1960-1990 period, a second covered the 
1987-2008 period. In the 1960-1990 period, current democracy was more strongly 
associated with higher life expectancy than cumulative democracy. The positive 
effects of current democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly by lower 
mortality from heart disease, pneumonia, liver cirrhosis, and suicide. In the 
1987-2008 period, however, current democracy was associated with lower, and 
cumulative democracy with higher life expectancy, particularly among men. The 
positive effects of cumulative democracy on total mortality were mediated mainly 
by lower mortality from circulatory diseases, cancer of the breast, and external 
causes. Current democracy was associated with higher mortality from motor 
vehicle accidents in both periods, and also with higher mortality from cancer 
and all external causes in the second. Our results suggest that in Europe during 
these two periods democratization has had mixed effects. That short-term changes 
in levels of democracy had positive effects in the first but not in the second 
period is probably due to the fact that democratization in Central and Eastern 
Europe was part of a complete system change which caused major societal 
disruptions.

BACKGROUND: Early-onset hypertension (HTN) is a major contributor to shortened 
life expectancy of African American men. Lifestyle changes are known to reduce 
blood pressure (BP); however, interventions tailored for young African American 
men have not been developed.
OBJECTIVES: With a community partner, we developed and assessed a HTN education 
and lifestyle intervention for young African American men.
METHODS: A preliminary plan was presented to experts and to 18- to 22-year-old 
African American men, and revised based on their feedback. The revised plan 
(health screening and 6-week intervention) was tested with the focal group.
LESSONS LEARNED: Participants were enthusiastic about the program and suggested 
improvements included increasing individualized guidance, building on 
relationships, and defining the Heart of Hypertension community.
CONCLUSIONS: The Heart of Hypertension Project holds promise for HTN prevention 
among young African American men. The next steps are to incorporate feedback 
from participants into the approach and evaluate the effectiveness of the 
intervention on lifestyle change and BP in young African American men with 
pre-HTN.

Medical Science, Tehran, Iran. Email: beiran_r@yahoo.com.

BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is the most serious complication of osteoporosis and 
imposes a significant financial burden on countries' economy. This study aimed 
to assess the hospitalization costs and length of stay associated with 
osteoporosis hip fractures and identify the major cost components in a referral 
hospital in Kermanshah city, Iran.
METHODS: In a prospective study, from May 21 2007 to May 21 2008, all patients 
with osteoporotic hip fracture admitted to a referral hospital for operation 
were recruited as the study sample. For each patient, information such as age, 
gender, length of stay (LOS) in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU), medical 
and diagnostic procedures and cost of surgery and implant were collected both 
through interview with the patient or a family member and the patients' hospital 
records.
RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (56 men and 47 women) were studied. The average 
hospital length of stay (LOS) for the patients was 9.7 days, ranging from 5 to 
38 days. The average total hospitalization costs was 7,208,588 IRR (US$774). The 
main components of the costs were ward stay (16.3%), operative (54.6%), implant 
(26%) and medical and diagnostic procedures (3.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the hospital resource 
burden associated with osteoporotic hip fractures in Iran is substantial and 
expected to rise with the projected increase of life expectancy and the number 
of elderly in Iran. Estimating the economic burden of osteoporotic hip fractures 
provide information that can be of importance in the planning and design of 
preventive strategies.

University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 01003, USA. edwardc@schoolph.umass.edu

This paper assesses the capacity of ionizing radiation to extend the lifespans 
of experimental insect models based on the peer-reviewed literature. Ionizing 
radiation biphasically affects the lifespans of adult males and females for a 
broad range of insect models with high doses reducing lifespan whereas lower 
doses can enhance lifespan, typically in the 20-60 % range. The average adult 
insect lifespan can be increased when ionizing radiation exposure is 
administered during early developmental stages or during the adult stage. The 
effective dose inducing the average adult insect lifespan enhancement may vary 
considerably depending upon which life stage is exposed. Recent findings have 
identified specific genes affecting anti-oxidant defenses, DNA repair, apoptosis 
and heat shock proteins as well as several cell signaling pathways that mediate 
the longevity enhancing hormetic response.

BACKGROUND: A feature of the health of men across Europe is their higher rates 
of premature mortality and shorter life expectancy at birth than women. 
Following the publication of the first State of Men's Health in Europe report, 
we sought to explore possible reasons.
METHOD: We analyzed trends in life expectancy at birth in 19 European Union 
member states (EU19) between 1999 and 2008 using mortality data obtained from 
Eurostat. We then used Pollard's decomposition method to identify the 
contribution of deaths from different causes and at different age groups to 
differences in life expectancy.
RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2008, life expectancy at birth in the EU19 increased 
by 2.74 years for men and by 2.09 years for women. Most of these improvements 
were due to reductions in mortality at ages >60, with cardiovascular disease 
accounting for approximately half these improvements for men. In 2008, life 
expectancy of men in the EU19 was 5.92 years lower than that of women. Deaths 
from all major groups of causes, and at all ages, contributed to this gap, with 
external causes contributing 0.96 years, cardiovascular disease 1.80 years and 
neoplasms 1.61 years.
CONCLUSION: Improvements in the life expectancy at birth of men and women have 
mostly occurred at older ages. There has been little improvement in the high 
rate of premature death in younger men, suggesting a need for interventions to 
tackle their high death rate.

Caveats for causal interpretations of linear regression coefficients for fine 
particulate (PM2.5) air pollution health effects.

Tony Cox LA Jr.

Recent linear regression analyses have concluded that decreasing levels of fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution have increased life expectancy in the 
United States. These findings have left unresolved questions about the causal 
relation between reductions in PM2.5 levels and changes in cause-specific 
(especially, cardiovascular disease, CVD) mortality risks. Their robustness 
(e.g., sensitivity to deletion of a single data point) has also been questioned. 
We investigate these issues in the National Mortality and Morbidity Air 
Pollution Study database. Comparing changes in PM2.5 levels and cause-specific 
mortality rates for elderly people in 24 cities between two periods separated by 
a decade (1987-1989 and 1999-2000) shows that reductions in PM2.5 were 
significantly associated with increases in respiratory mortality rates and with 
decreases in CVD mortality rates. CVD and all-cause mortality risks fell equally 
for all months of the year over this period, but average PM2.5 levels increased 
significantly for winter months. This casts doubts on the causal interpretation 
that declines in PM2.5 over the decade caused reduced short-term mortality 
risks. Nonlinear regression suggests that reduced or negative marginal health 
benefits are associated with reductions of PM2.5 below 1999-2000 levels (about 
15 μg/m(3)). Such nonlinear relations imply that risk communication statements 
that project a constant incremental reduction in mortality risks per unit 
reduction in PM2.5 do not adequately reflect the realistic possibility of 
nonlinear exposure-response relations and diminishing returns to further 
exposure reductions.

Cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in 
preventing stroke and other cardiovascular events in patients with atrial 
fibrillation.

University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of new 
oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation. Secondary objectives related to assessing the cost-effectiveness 
of new oral anticoagulants stratified by center-specific time in therapeutic 
range, age, and CHADS2 score.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Analysis used a Markov cohort model 
that followed patients from initiation of pharmacotherapy to death. Transition 
probabilities were obtained from a concurrent network meta-analysis. Utility 
values and costs were obtained from published data. Numerous deterministic 
sensitivity analyses and probabilistic analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for dabigatran 150 mg versus 
warfarin was $20,797. Apixaban produced equal QALYs at a higher cost. Dabigatran 
110 mg and rivaroxaban were dominated by dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban. Results 
were sensitive to the drug costs of apixaban, the time horizon adopted, and the 
consequences from major and minor bleeds with dabigatran. Results varied by a 
center's average time in therapeutic range, a patient's CHADS2 score, and 
patient age, with either dabigatran 150 mg or apixaban being optimal.
CONCLUSIONS: Results were highly sensitive to patient characteristics. 
Rivaroxaban and dabigatran 110 mg were unlikely to be cost-effective. For 
different characteristics, apixaban or dabigatran 150 mg were optimal. Thus, the 
choice between these two options may come down to the price of apixaban and 
further evidence on the impact of major and minor bleeds with dabigatran.

Cost-effectiveness of trabectedin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin for the 
treatment of women with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer in the UK: 
analysis based on the final survival data of the OVA-301 trial.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of trabectedin plus pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared with PLD alone for the treatment of 
patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who are not expected to 
benefit from retreatment with platinum-based therapies based on the final 
survival data published in October 2012.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model estimated the cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained for trabectedin plus PLD compared with PLD alone from 
the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective over a 
lifetime horizon. Mean progression-free survival and overall survival were 
calculated by using parametric survival distributions adjusted for imbalances 
discovered in the final survival data. Between-arm imbalances included the 
platinum-free interval, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), and Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance score. Cost categories included drug, administration, 
medical management, and treatment of adverse events. Quality of life was 
measured by using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Uncertainty was 
addressed by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, trabectedin plus PLD increased mean 
progression-free survival by 3.0 months and overall survival by 9.7 months 
compared with PLD alone. The additional cost and QALYs of trabectedin plus PLD 
were £18,476 and 0.49, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
£38,026 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that results were sensitive to 
platinum-free interval adjustment and the choice of survival distributions.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis estimated a significant improvement in mean overall 
survival and incremental cost per QALY compared with that calculated in the 
original National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence assessment, which 
was based on immature survival data.

OBJECTIVES: Hospital admissions for exacerbations of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease are the main cost drivers of the disease. An alternative is to 
treat suitable patients at home instead of in the hospital. This article reports 
on the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of early assisted discharge in The 
Netherlands.
METHODS: In the multicenter randomized controlled Assessment of GOing Home under 
Early Assisted Discharge trial (n = 139), one group received 7 days of inpatient 
hospital treatment (HOSP) and one group was discharged after 3 days and treated 
at home by community nurses for 4 days. Health care resource use, productivity 
losses, and informal care were recorded in cost questionnaires. Microcosting was 
performed for inpatient day costs.
RESULTS: Seven days after admission, mean change from baseline Clinical Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Questionnaire score was better for HOSP, but not 
statistically significantly: 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]-0.04 to 0.61). 
The difference in the probability of having a clinically relevant improvement 
was significant in favor of HOSP: 19.0%-point (95% CI 0.5%-36.3%). After 3 
months of follow-up, differences in effectiveness had almost disappeared. The 
difference in quality-adjusted life-years was 0.0054 (95% CI-0.021 to 0.0095). 
From a health care perspective, early assisted discharge was cost saving:-€244 
(treatment phase, 95% CI-€315 to-€168) and-€168 (3 months, 95% CI-€1253 to 
€922). Societal perspective:-€65 (treatment phase, 95% CI-€152 to €25) and €908 
(3 months, 95% CI-€553 to €2296). The savings per quality-adjusted life-year 
lost were €31,111 from a health care perspective. From a societal perspective, 
HOSP was dominant.
CONCLUSIONS: No clear evidence was found to conclude that either treatment was 
more effective or less costly.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and value of simulating whole disease and 
treatment pathways within a single model to provide a common economic basis for 
informing resource allocation decisions.
METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was developed with the intention of 
being capable of evaluating multiple topics within National Institute for Health 
and Clinical Excellence's colorectal cancer clinical guideline. The model 
simulates disease and treatment pathways from preclinical disease through to 
detection, diagnosis, adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatments, follow-up, 
curative/palliative treatments for metastases, supportive care, and eventual 
death. The model parameters were informed by meta-analyses, randomized trials, 
observational studies, health utility studies, audit data, costing sources, and 
expert opinion. Unobservable natural history parameters were calibrated against 
external data using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Economic analysis 
was undertaken using conventional cost-utility decision rules within each 
guideline topic and constrained maximization rules across multiple topics.
RESULTS: Under usual processes for guideline development, piecewise economic 
modeling would have been used to evaluate between one and three topics. The 
Whole Disease Model was capable of evaluating 11 of 15 guideline topics, ranging 
from alternative diagnostic technologies through to treatments for metastatic 
disease. The constrained maximization analysis identified a configuration of 
colorectal services that is expected to maximize quality-adjusted life-year 
gains without exceeding current expenditure levels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that Whole Disease Model development is 
feasible and can allow for the economic analysis of most interventions across a 
disease service within a consistent conceptual and mathematical infrastructure. 
This disease-level modeling approach may be of particular value in providing an 
economic basis to support other clinical guidelines.

QALY and productivity loss: empirical evidence for "double counting".

Saitama, Japan. t.shiroiwa@gmail.com

OBJECTIVES: When quality-adjusted life-years are used for economic evaluation, 
the controversial issue of "double counting" of productivity loss emerges, 
particularly given the lack of empirical data.
METHODS: In this study, we performed a Web-based, large-sample survey to address 
the issue of double counting. To determine the influence of income reduction on 
utility scores, we obtained utility scores of eight health states with three 
instruction types: a) no instruction, b) instructed to consider income 
reduction, and c) instructed not to consider income reduction (compensated). 
Respondents were randomly sampled from the online panel and asked to evaluate 1 
of 24 patterns by both standard gamble and time trade-off methods.
RESULTS: A total of 6551 respondents completed the questionnaire. First, despite 
the lack of instruction on income reduction, many respondents spontaneously 
assumed lost income. The proportion tended to be higher when considering more 
severe health states. Second, the degree of assumed income reduction was related 
to utility scores. For a 10% income reduction, respondents assumed a 0.02- to 
0.04-decrease in utility score (both standard gamble and time trade-off 
methods). Third, utility scores did not change significantly when instruction 
was given not to consider income reduction (compensated) compared with when no 
instruction was given.
CONCLUSIONS: An assumed income reduction clearly influenced utility scores; 
however, compensation for lost income failed to sufficiently improve utility 
scores. In our view, the effect of income on utility scores does not only 
reflect wage loss. Our results suggest that the impact of double counting is 
negligible.

Using a survey to estimate health expectancy and quality-adjusted life 
expectancy to assess inequalities in health and quality of life.

Collins B(1).

BACKGROUND: There has been a policy debate in the United Kingdom about moving 
beyond traditional measures of life expectancy and economic output to developing 
more meaningful ways of measuring national well-being.
