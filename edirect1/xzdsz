homes. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the acceptability and challenges 
of C-BART to guide program improvement.
METHODS: For this qualitative descriptive study, research assistants collected 
data (August-December 2017) through in-depth interviews with 40 patients, seven 
health extension workers, and 11 policy/program managers, and through four focus 
group discussions with healthcare workers. Interviews were audio-recorded, 
translated, and coded using MAXQDA v.12. Data were analyzed using thematic 
analysis.
RESULTS: The evaluation identified five themes: community ownership, acceptance 
of the C-BART sites, benefits of the C-BART program for the PLHIV community and 
their social networks, benefits of the C-BART program to the main health 
facility, and challenges with the C-BART program. The C-BART program was 
reported as life-changing by many patients who had previously struggled to 
afford four-wheel drive vehicles to access care. Patients and healthcare workers 
perceived that the community as a whole benefited from the C-BART sites not only 
due to the financial pressure lifted from friends and family members previously 
asked to help cover expensive transportation, but also due to the perception of 
diminished stigmatization of people living with HIV and improved health. The 
C-BART sites became a source of community and social support for those accessing 
the sites. Healthcare workers reported greater job satisfaction and decongestion 
of health facilities. The challenges that they reported included delays in 
authorization of vehicles for transportation to C-BART sites and lack of 
incentives to provide services in the community.
CONCLUSION: The C-BART program can serve as a model of care to expand access to 
HIV care and treatment and other health services to populations in remote 
settings, including rural and difficult-to-reach regions. The needs of 
healthcare workers should also be considered for the optimal delivery of such a 
model.

To investigate the sex differences in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due 
to ischemic stroke (IS) by year, location and age. We extracted sex-specific 
data on DALYs number, age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) and all-age DALYs rate 
of IS by year, location and age from the Global Burden of Diseases study 2019. 
The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) were calculated to evaluate the 
temporal trend of ASDR. For both sexes, although the ASDR of IS slightly 
decreased from 1990 to 2019, there has been an 60.3% increase in DALYs number 
worldwide. Sex difference in DALYs number (men minus women) decreased from 
- 2.83 million in 1990 to 0.14 million in 2019, while the men to women's ASDR 
ratio slightly increased from 1.10 in 1990 to 1.21 in 2019. The sex differences 
in IS DALYs showed remarkable regional variation. The largest sex differences in 
DALYs number and ASDR were in China and Vietnam. Middle-aged men had a higher IS 
DALYs than their age-matched counterparts. High systolic blood pressure 
accounted for the highest DALYs number in 2019, but the top three attributable 
risk factors that had the greatest sex differences were tobacco, dietary risk, 
and alcohol use. Sex differences in IS DALYs varied by year, location and age, 
mostly attributed to the disproportion of cardiovascular risk factors between 
sexes. Considering the population growth and aging, it is necessary to monitor 
the sex difference in IS DALYs in different populations and thus provide 
evidence for local administration to improve current preventive and management 
strategies of IS.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the addition of pembrolizumab 
in various combinations in patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer.
METHODS: A decision-analysis model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab and bevacizumab (CPB) relative to chemotherapy 
plus pembrolizumab (CP) and chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (CB) in cervical 
cancer patients. Data from KEYNOTE-826 was used to estimate quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Drug cost estimates were obtained using average wholesale 
prices. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to 
determine cost/QALY. The willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) was set a 
$100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed on cost and effectiveness for 
pembrolizumab-containing regimens.
RESULTS: Cost of treatment with CB, CP, and CPB were $416 million (M), $713 M, 
and $1.51 billion, respectively. Relative to CB, the ICER for CP was $92,678. 
CPB was dominated. Sensitivity analyses were performed varying the cost and 
efficacy of CP and CPB. If overall survival (OS) with CP decreased from 24.4 
months to 23.4 months, the ICER would exceed the WTP. If the OS from CP is 
assumed to be 20.4 months, the ICER increases to $187,746. The ICER for CP 
improves to $63,670 when the model is restricted to PD-L1 positive cancers. With 
CP eliminated, CPB becomes cost-effective relative to CB if the cost of 
pembrolizumab per cycle decreases from $12,080 to $2913 for the baseline model 
and to $4644 for the PD-L1 model.
CONCLUSIONS: CP is cost-effective relative to CB for recurrent or metastatic 
cervical cancer. The efficacy of CPB would need to far exceed both CB and CP to 
be cost-effective. Restricting the model to patients with PD-L1 positive tumors 
dramatically improves the ICER for CP relative to CB by $30,000/QALY.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of cost-utility 
studies of internet-based and face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for depression from childhood to adulthood and to examine their reporting and 
methodological quality.
METHODS: A structured search for cost-utility studies concerning CBT for 
depression was performed in 7 comprehensive databases from their inception to 
July 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, abstracted data, 
and assessed quality using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting 
Standards and Quality of Health Economic Studies checklists. The primary outcome 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) across all studies. To make 
a relevant comparison of the ICERs across the identified studies, cost data were 
inflated to the year 2020 and converted into US dollars.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were included in this review, of which 26 studies 
(68%) were deemed of high methodological quality and 12 studies (32%) of fair 
quality. Despite differences in study designs and settings, the conclusions of 
most included studies for adult depression were general agreement; they showed 
that face-to-face CBT monotherapy or combination therapy compared with 
antidepressants and usual care for adult depression were cost-effective from the 
societal, health system, or payer perspective (ICER -$241 212.4/quality-adjusted 
life-year [QALY] to $33 032.47/QALY, time horizon 12-60 months). Internet-based 
CBT regardless of guided or unguided also has a significant cost-effectiveness 
advantage (ICER -$37 717.52/QALY to $73 841.34/QALY, time horizon 3-36 months). 
In addition, CBT was cost-effective in preventing depression (ICER -$23 
932.07/QALY to $26 092.02/QALY, time horizon 9-60 months). Nevertheless, the 
evidence for the cost-effectiveness of CBT for children and adolescents was 
still ambiguous.
CONCLUSIONS: Fair or high-quality evidence showed that CBT monotherapy or 
combination therapy for adult depression was cost-effective; whether CBT-related 
therapy was cost-effective for children and adolescents depression remains 
inconclusive.

BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing need to update the recommended values 
of Korean exposure factors for adults aged 19 and older, as using exposure 
factors developed over a decade ago could reduce risk assessment reliability.
OBJECTIVE: Exposure factor data have been compiled and standardized using the 
latest national statistical reports and academic literature, as well as studies 
conducted from 2016 to 2018.
METHODS: The updated data contained anthropometric parameters, inhalation rates, 
food and drinking water ingestion rates, and time-activity patterns and provided 
technical information on Koreans' exposure factors classified by sex, age group, 
per capita and general population, and doer-only for various exposure 
assessments.
RESULTS: Although the average life expectancy, body weight, body surface area, 
and inhalation rate increased slightly compared to the 2007 Korean Exposure 
Factor Handbook, differences various in food consumption were remarkable. 
Because of Asians' similar food preferences, the intake rate of grain products 
and vegetables in Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese contributed much toward total 
intake. Koreans spent half their times outdoors compared to Americans and 
Chinese.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study provided the currently updated exposure factor 
information for Koreans and could be compared with recommendations provided by 
exposure factor resources in various countries.
IMPACT STATEMENT: Exposure to environmental pollutants may significantly vary 
depending on the exposure factors related to human behaviors and 
characteristics. Therefore the exposure factors need to be continuously updated 
along with more extensive survey areas and improved measurement methods. We 
utilized the existing data with the aim to develop general exposure factors for 
risk assessment in Korean aged ≥19 years. Measurements and questionnaire surveys 
were also performed if there were no existing data. This study provided the 
currently updated exposure factor information for Koreans and could be compared 
to those of other countries.

Pin corrosion is a critical issue that causes premature rupture of high-voltage 
insulators. The development of efficient, defect-free, thermal resistive, hard, 
economical and environment-friendly sealing coating system is required to 
replace the current polymer-based highly toxic coatings for insulators. This 
study investigates the suitability of noble cerium (Ce)-based sealing coating 
film for use as an anti-corrosion coating for insulator pins installed in low-pH 
and highly corrosive sites. The coating bath parameters are optimized for the 
formation of a high-performance Ce-based protective sealing coating. After 
immersion in a 60 000 ppm CeCl3.7H2O sealing coating bath for 60 min, a Ce-rich 
and dense protective coating (24 µm) is formed on the pin surface. The life 
expectancy of the coated pin is 2.5 times higher than that of the non-coated 
galvanized pins. Electrochemical experiments and microstructural analysis 
demonstrate that Ce-based protective layers are suitable for long-term 
protection of high-voltage insulator pins in low-pH and high-corrosion-rate 
sites. We believe that this work would pave the way of developing ecofriendly 
anti-corrosion coatings for electric insulators and power industries.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has created a great deal of fear and 
uncertainty about health, economy, and social life. Therefore, the health, 
social, and economic impacts of COVID-19 are of great importance. In prone rural 
communities, tourism industry can contribute to the sustainable economy and 
social development of the villagers, and as a dynamic economic sector, cause 
economic, social, cultural, and environmental changes. In this regard, the 
purpose of this inquiry was to develop tourism during the coronavirus pandemic 
using the social exchange theory (SET). The present study is a descriptive, 
correlational and causal inquiry that is conducted using survey technique. The 
statistical population included tourists visiting Sistan region around Hamoun 
Wetland in eastern Iran (N = 850). In the sampling process, 266 tourists were 
selected as a sample using random sampling strategy. The study instrument was a 
researcher-made questionnaire, whose validity was confirmed by a panel of 
subjectivists and its reliability was approved by a pilot study and Cronbach's 
alpha coefficients (0.87≥ α ≥ 0.71). Based on SET, the proposed causal model was 
able to explain about 56% ( RAdj2 = 0.562) of the variance changes in tourism 
development during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Forward osmosis (FO) technology has been acknowledged as an energy-efficient 
cutting-edge water treatment innovation; however, the inefficient performance of 
polymer-based membranes remains a tailback in the practical utilization of FO. A 
significant issue in FO is membrane fouling, which negatively influences the 
flux efficiency, working expenses and membrane life expectancy. Membranes having 
high water flux and minimum reverse solute flux at low operating pressures are 
the ideal membranes for this process. This study reports a thin-film 
nanocomposite (TFNC) membrane for the treatment of textile industry wastewater 
utilizing fertilizer as draw solution fabricated via the phase inversion 
process. The chemical structure and morphology of the synthesized manganese 
oxide (MnO2) incorporated membrane were studied by various characterization 
techniques like X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 
scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, contact angle 
and gravimetry. The outcomes demonstrated that the nanoparticles were bonded to 
cellulose acetate polymer via covalent bonds and showed very hydrophilic 
membrane surface, along with an increased osmotic water flux of 52.5 L.m2.h-1 
and reverse salt flux of 10.9 g.m2.h-1, when deionized wastewater and potassium 
chloride were used as the feed solution and the draw solution, respectively. In 
this manner, incorporating manganese oxide into the FO membrane may introduce 
its extraordinary possible application for the production of diluted fertilizer 
solution with balanced nutrients.

WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Individuals with a severe mental illness (SMI) 
are less physically active and have a lower life expectancy than the general 
population due to increased risks of cardiometabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes 
and respiratory diseases) and other health risks. Physical activity has been 
used as an adjunct therapy for individuals with SMI yielding improvements in 
cognitive functioning, quality of life and a reduction in psychiatric symptoms. 
Individuals with SMI residing within a secure forensic setting have reduced 
physical activity opportunities, possibly due to a number of factors including 
low motivation and restricted access to exercise facilities combined with a lack 
of knowledge and/or confidence in staff members to assist in physical activity 
programmes. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This review demonstrates 
that little is known around the effects of physical activity for people with SMI 
who reside in secure forensic settings, with little to no long-term effects 
reported. Physical activity interventions have shown some positive results 
through decreasing weight and waist circumference as well as a reduction in 
negative symptom scores in an exercise group compared with the "no treatment" 
control group post-intervention. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: 
Service users' reluctance to engage in physical activity may be overcome by 
improving staff commitment, creating a motivational atmosphere and promoting 
service user decision making.
ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Participating in physical activity has many benefits, 
yet those with severe mental illness (SMI) living in forensic settings are less 
likely to be active, and more likely to experience ill-health. The aim of this 
study was to systematically review the effectiveness of physical activity 
programmes on mental and physical health and specifically on reducing symptoms 
of SMI in forensic settings.
METHOD: A systematic search of six databases was conducted, in addition to a 
grey literature search. Studies were included if they had participants with SMI; 
were based in a forensic setting; involved a physical activity programme and 
reported physical and mental health outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 112 participants were included in four studies. One study 
showed a significant improvement in negative symptom scores in the exercise 
group compared with a treatment as usual group. Two studies reported 
improvements in psychiatric symptoms with no significant difference between 
groups; however, statistically significant changes in weight and waist 
circumference were evident (p < .001). No adverse effects were reported.
CONCLUSION: Only a small number of studies were included and of limited design 
and quality, with no follow-up assessments; therefore, more research is needed 
to determine the true effects of physical activity for improving SMI symptoms in 
a forensic setting. This review highlights the need for further studies 
exploring the barriers and facilitators of physical activity in secure forensic 
settings. Studies are required that include a more thorough research design. 
Furthermore, interventions if designed with patients and caring staff in mind 
may lead to lowered psychiatric symptoms and increased physical health benefits 
for all in forensic settings.

AIM: The decision-making process to defunction a pelvic colorectal anastomosis 
involves complex heuristics and is framed by surgeon personality factors. Risk 
taking propensity may be an important factor in these decisions and patient 
preferences have not been evaluated alongside surgeons and nurses.
METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study involving a one-off interview and 
questionnaire assessing how risk taking propensity affects nurse, surgeon and 
patient preferences for a temporary defunctioning ileostomy (TDI) was performed. 
The risk taking index (RTI) was employed to evaluate risk taking propensity and 
the validated prospective measures of preference instruments to evaluate 
preferences for stoma avoidance in several scenarios by asking the individual to 
consider trading or gambling years of remaining life expectancy.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty participants met the inclusion criteria, which 
included 30 (20.0%) surgical nurses, 20 (13.3%) colorectal surgeons and 100 
(66.7%) patients. Surgeons had a significantly higher RTI (mean ± SD: 
26.8 ± 6.7) than patients (mean ± SD: 20.0 ± 9.8) and nurses (mean ± SD: 
23.0 ± 6.6) p = 0.002. Surgeons would consider that it would be in a patient's 
best interest to have a TDI at an AL rate of 15% or greater, whereas nurses and 
patients would do so at 28% and 25%, respectively (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Surgeons were shown to have a higher risk taking propensity than 
patients and nurses but a significantly lower threshold of AL where they would 
consider a TDI is in the best interest of the patient.

BACKGROUND: When a cardiac arrest occurs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should 
be started immediately. However, there is limited evidence about the best 
approach to airway management during cardiac arrest.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether or not the i-gel® 
(Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, UK) supraglottic airway is superior to tracheal 
intubation as the initial advanced airway management strategy in adults with 
non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
DESIGN: This was a pragmatic, open, parallel, two-group, multicentre, cluster 
randomised controlled trial. A cost-effectiveness analysis accompanied the 
trial.
SETTING: The setting was four ambulance services in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years who had a non-traumatic out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest and were attended by a participating paramedic were enrolled 
automatically under a waiver of consent between June 2015 and August 2017. 
Follow-up ended in February 2018.
INTERVENTION: Paramedics were randomised 1 : 1 to use tracheal intubation (764 
paramedics) or i-gel (759 paramedics) for their initial advanced airway 
management and were unblinded.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score at 
hospital discharge or 30 days after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whichever 
occurred earlier, collected by assessors blinded to allocation. The modified 
Rankin Scale, a measure of neurological disability, was dichotomised: a score of 
0-3 (good outcome) or 4-6 (poor outcome/death). The primary outcome for the 
economic evaluation was quality-adjusted life-years, estimated using the 
EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version.
RESULTS: A total of 9296 patients (supraglottic airway group, 4886; tracheal 
intubation group, 4410) were enrolled [median age 73 years; 3373 (36.3%) women]; 
modified Rankin Scale score was known for 9289 patients. Characteristics were 
similar between groups. A total of 6.4% (311/4882) of patients in the 
supraglottic airway group and 6.8% (300/4407) of patients in the tracheal 
intubation group had a good outcome (adjusted difference in proportions of 
patients experiencing a good outcome: -0.6%, 95% confidence interval -1.6% to 
0.4%). The supraglottic airway group had a higher initial ventilation success 
rate than the tracheal intubation group [87.4% (4255/4868) vs. 79.0% 
(3473/4397), respectively; adjusted difference in proportions of patients: 8.3%, 
95% confidence interval 6.3% to 10.2%]; however, patients in the tracheal 
intubation group were less likely to receive advanced airway management than 
patients in the supraglottic airway group [77.6% (3419/4404) vs. 85.2% 
(4161/4883), respectively]. Regurgitation rate was similar between the groups 
[supraglottic airway group, 26.1% (1268/4865); tracheal intubation group, 24.5% 
(1072/4372); adjusted difference in proportions of patients: 1.4%, 95% 
confidence interval -0.6% to 3.4%], as was aspiration rate [supraglottic airway 
group, 15.1% (729/4824); tracheal intubation group, 14.9% (647/4337); adjusted 
difference in proportions of patients: 0.1%, 95% confidence interval -1.5% to 
1.8%]. The longer-term outcomes were also similar between the groups (modified 
Rankin Scale: at 3 months, odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 
1.14; at 6 months, odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.16). 
Sensitivity analyses did not alter the overall findings. There were no 
unexpected serious adverse events. Mean quality-adjusted life-years to 6 months 
were 0.03 in both groups (supraglottic airway group minus tracheal intubation 
group difference -0.0015, 95% confidence interval -0.0059 to 0.0028), and total 
costs were £157 (95% confidence interval -£270 to £583) lower in the tracheal 
intubation group. Although the point estimate of the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio suggested that tracheal intubation may be 
cost-effective, the huge uncertainty around this result indicates no evidence of 
a difference between groups.
LIMITATIONS: Limitations included imbalance in the number of patients in each 
group, caused by unequal distribution of high-enrolling paramedics; crossover 
between groups; and the fact that participating paramedics, who were volunteers, 
might not be representative of all paramedics in the UK. Findings may not be 
applicable to other countries.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, randomisation to 
the supraglottic airway group compared with the tracheal intubation group did 
not result in a difference in outcome at 30 days. There were no notable 
differences in costs, outcomes and overall cost-effectiveness between the 
groups.
FUTURE WORK: Future work could compare alternative supraglottic airway types 
with tracheal intubation; include a randomised trial of bag mask ventilation 
versus supraglottic airways; and involve other patient populations, including 
children, people with trauma and people in hospital.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN08256118.

Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and supported by the NIHR 
Comprehensive Research Networks and will be published in full in Health

Plain Language Summary: BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a serious medical 
emergency in which the heartbeat and breathing stop suddenly. Every year in the 
UK, a large number of patients (around 123 per 100,000) suffer a cardiac arrest 
outside hospital. Only 7–9% of these patients survive to leave hospital. The 
best initial treatment in cardiac arrest is cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(commonly known as CPR), during which it is vital to give chest compressions and 
maintain a clear airway. Two main techniques are used to keep the airway clear: 
tracheal intubation (inserting a breathing tube into the windpipe) and a 
supraglottic airway device (a newer device that is inserted less deeply and sits 
just above the voicebox). Both techniques are used routinely by paramedics in 
the UK when treating a cardiac arrest, but there is no evidence about which 
technique is best. The AIRWAYS-2 trial aimed to find out whether or not a 
supraglottic airway device is better than tracheal intubation.
WHO PARTICIPATED AND WHAT WAS INVOLVED? Paramedics from four UK ambulance 
services were put into one of two groups at random. One group was randomly 
chosen to use tracheal intubation and the other group was randomly chosen to use 
a supraglottic airway device at all adult cardiac arrests they attended for 
approximately 2 years. Paramedics were able to apply their clinical judgement 
and use a different device if they felt that this would be best for the patient. 
A total of 1523 paramedics took part and enrolled 9296 patients. Following 
cardiac arrest, a patient’s recovery was assessed as good or poor (including 
patients who did not survive).
WHAT DID THE TRIAL FIND? A similar percentage of patients in both groups had a 
good recovery. There was no evidence to suggest that the supraglottic airway 
device was any better than tracheal intubation for treating a cardiac arrest.

BACKGROUND: This study details the within-trial economic evaluation and 
long-term economic model of SITLESS, a multi-country, three-armed randomized 
controlled trial comparing a combined intervention of exercise referral schemes 
(ERS) enhanced by self-management strategies (SMS) against ERS alone and usual 
care (UC).
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis, conducted from the base-case perspective of 
the National Health Service and personal and social services, estimated the 
incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and years in 
full capability (YFC). A secondary analysis combined the costs with a broad set 
of outcomes within a cost-consequence framework, from a societal perspective. A 
Markov-type decision-analytic model was developed to project short-term changes 
in physical activity to long-term outcomes and costs, over a 5- and 15-year time 
horizon.
RESULTS: The results of the within-trial analysis show that SMS+ERS is highly 
likely to be cost-effective compared to ERS alone (ICER €4270/QALY), but not 
compared to UC. Participants allocated to the SMS+ERS group also showed an 
improvement in YFC compared to ERS alone and UC. The long-term analysis revealed 
that SMS+ERS is likely to be a cost-effective option compared to ERS and UC over 
a 5-year, but not with a 15-year horizon, being then dominated by ERS alone.
CONCLUSION: This research provides new evidence that SMS is a cost-effective 
add-on to ERS strategies. This economic evaluation informs the case for further, 
cost-effective, refinement of lifestyle change programmes targeted to older 
adults, with the aim of ultimately reducing the impact of non-communicable 
diseases in this population.

OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
recently approved first-line treatments, toripalimab or camrelizumab combined 
with gemcitabine plus cisplatin2 (GP) and GP alone for patients with recurrent 
or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma3 (RM-NPC) from the Chinese payers' 
perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a Markov model to estimate the cost and 
effectiveness of currently first-line therapies for RM-NPC. Survival data were 
derived from the CAPTAIN-1st and JUPITER-02 trials. Direct medical costs and 
utilities were collected from the published literature and standard fee 
database. Main outcomes were total costs, quality-adjusted life-year4 (QALY), 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) at a willingness-to-pay5 (WTP) 
of $34 066/QALY. The robustness of the model was assessed by performing one-way 
and probability sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with the GP chemotherapy, toripalimab or camrelizumab plus GP 
chemotherapy as first-line therapy for RM-NPC provided an incremental cost of $6 
026 and $43 138 with additional 0.90 QALYs and 0.78 QALYs, respectively, 
resulting in an ICER of 6 696 $/QALY and 55 305 $/QALY. In the pairwise 
comparison between the two immunotherapy-related groups, toripalimab plus GP was 
the dominant strategy with lower costs and higher efficiency than the 
camrelizumab plus GP group.
CONCLUSION: In our analysis, compared with GP chemotherapy alone, toripalimab 
plus GP was more cost-effective, while camrelizumab plus GP chemotherapy was not 
cost-effective. In the pairwise comparison between the two immunotherapy-related 
groups, toripalimab plus GP would be more cost-effective than camrelizumab plus 
GP chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital anomaly 
at birth, affecting approximately 1% of live births. In recent decades great 
medical and surgical advances have significantly increased life expectancy, 
shifting healthcare professionals' and researchers' interests in patients' 
Quality of Life (QoL). The main aims of our study were to evaluate generic and 
condition-specific QoL in a group of Italian children and adolescents with CHD 
and their parents and examine the level of agreement and directional 
disagreement between child/adolescent and parents reports on generic and 
condition-specific QoL.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed with CHD children and adolescents 
and their parents referred to the Cardiology Department of "Bambino Gesù" 
Children's Hospital. The PedsQL scale was used, including generic (PedsQL 4.0) 
and cardiac-specific modules (PedsQL 3.0) were administered to patients and 
caregivers. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare generic and cardiac module 
scores between patients with different ages, CHD diagnoses, and between patients 
who underwent surgery interventions and/or are currently taking cardiac 
medications.
RESULTS: 498 families were enrolled in this study. On average, patients reported 
a good level of generic and condition-specific QoL, as well as their mothers and 
fathers. Children aged between 5-7 years old reported lower generic and 
cardiac-specific total QoL levels than children aged 8-12 years and adolescents 
(13-18 years). With regard to the agreement, patient-parent agreement on 
condition-specific QoL ranged from 25 to 75% while on generic QoL, it ranged 
from 19 to 76%. The highest percentage of disagreement between parents and 
children was found in patients aged 5-7 years old, both for condition-specific 
and generic QoL rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributed to the growing body of knowledge on QoL in 
CHD, emphasizing the need for these families to receive support from 
multidisciplinary standardized care, including psychological consultations and 
support.

BACKGROUND: Planning and decision-making for the elderly requires a special 
attention due to the beginning of aging process in Iran. By emphasizing the 
concept of active aging, determining the status of the elderly like their 
ability to continue work over time, to attain income and to participate in 
social and political life is significant. Active aging uses the indicators 
measuring the non-used potential of the elderly for having an active and healthy 
aging. This study aimed to determine the level of active aging among the 
provinces of Iran in 2018 by considering 11 indicators related to elderly's 
health, well-being and socioeconomic participation.
METHODS: The raw data were obtained from Statistical Center of Iran. After 
establishing the indicators based on the Global Age Watch approach, the 
provinces were ranked by the TOPSIS method in terms of aging status.
RESULTS: The results indicated that only Tehran and Alborz had the highest 
development level of active aging while 16% of the provinces had a 
semi-developed status and 77% failed at experiencing a satisfactory welfare, 
economic and social status.
CONCLUSIONS: Four indicators had the highest importance included the percentage 
of the elderly with a diploma and academic degree, the percentage of the elderly 
with lower incomes than the median income, the median income of the elderly to 
the median income of the other people in society, and life expectancy among the 
65-year old men. Studying the indicators deeply can result in the appropriate 
planning for each area in line with the improvement of the elderly status.

BACKGROUND: The provision of optimal and quality services during labour, 
delivery and in the early neonatal period is highly required to accelerate the 
reduction of neonatal deaths and improve the quality of life of newborns. The 
availability of competent health professionals and the essential medicines and 
supplies in the health facilities are compulsory. Cost-effective interventions 
exist to prevent more than 80% of all newborn deaths. However, an unacceptably 
high number of newborns are dying in the study area, and much is not known about 
the main contributing factors in primary healthcare settings. This study aimed 
to explore and describe the quality of care provided to newborns in the primary 
healthcare units.
METHODS: Qualitative exploratory and descriptive design was employed. Focus 
group discussions were held with 26 participants (11 health workers and 15 
health extension workers) in three woredas in the West Gojjam zone, Ethiopia. 
Health workers and health extension workers were purposely selected. Thematic 
analysis was undertaken.
RESULTS: The primary healthcare facilities play a major role in the provision of 
essential services for newborns in the critical periods, including during labor 
and birth, immediately after birth and in the early postnatal care period. 
Resuscitation of birth asphyxia, prevention of hypothermia, initiation of 
breastfeeding, application of tetracycline, vitamin k injection, weighing babies 
and chlorhexidine application were identified as immediate essential 
intervention for the newborns. However, these interventions are hampered by 
factors such as lack of adequately trained staff & hands-on skills; weak 
referral linkage; stock-out of essential medicines and supplies and poor quality 
for early postnatal care home visits.
CONCLUSIONS: In order to enhance the quality of newborns healthcare provision, 
the health-systems constraints at health centres and heath posts level should be 
fixed to provide the required services for newborns. This requires allocation of 
adequate resources to tackle health facilities readiness related bottlenecks, 
such as the frequent stock out or lack of essential supplies, equipment, and 
medicines, lack of proper space for the service provision, not systematic 
replenishing of the revised job-aids and maintenance of medical equipment, poor 
infection prevention including water and sanitation in the maternity wards and 
newborn corners.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to decompose the age and cause inequality in life 
expectancy between two Iranian provinces with the highest and the lowest life
