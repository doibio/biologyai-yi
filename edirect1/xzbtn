OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness 
and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of sacubitril-valsartan 
relative to enalapril for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction (HFrEF).
BACKGROUND: Compared with enalapril, combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin 
inhibition (ARNI), as is found in sacubitril-valsartan, reduces cardiovascular 
death and heart failure hospitalization rates in patients with HFrEF.
METHODS: Using a Markov model, costs, effects, and cost-effectiveness were 
estimated for sacubitril-valsartan and enalapril therapies for the treatment of 
HFrEF. Patients were 60 years of age at model entry and were modeled over a 
lifetime (40 years) from a third-party payer perspective. Clinical probabilities 
were derived predominantly from PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With 
ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure). 
All costs and effects were discounted at a 3% rate annually and are presented in 
2015 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: In the base case, sacubitril-valsartan, compared with enalapril, was 
more costly ($60,391 vs. $21,758) and more effective (6.49 vs. 5.74 QALYs) over 
a lifetime. The cost-effectiveness of sacubitril-valsartan was highly dependent 
on duration of treatment, ranging from $249,411 per QALY at 3 years to $50,959 
per QALY gained over a lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS: Sacubitril-valsartan may be a cost-effective treatment option 
depending on the willingness-to-pay threshold. Future investigations should 
incorporate real-world evidence with sacubitril-valsartan to further inform 
decision making.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide with a 
rising incidence rate in most countries. Considering the increase in life 
expectancy and change in lifestyle of Iranian women, this study investigated the 
age-adjusted trend of breast cancer incidence during 2000-2009 and predicted its 
incidence to 2020.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 1997 and 2006 census results were used for the 
projection of female population by age through the cohort-component method over 
the studied years. Data from the Iranian cancer registration system were used to 
calculate the annual incidence rate of breast cancer. The age-adjusted incidence 
rate was then calculated using the WHO standard population distribution. The 
five-year-age-specific incidence rates were also obtained for each year and 
future incidence was determined using the trend analysis method. Annual 
percentage change (APC) was calculated through the joinpoint regression method.
RESULTS: The bias adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer increased from 16.7 
per 100,000 women in 2000 to 33.6 per 100,000 women in 2009. The incidence of 
breast cancer had a growing trend in almost all age groups above 30 years over 
the studied years. In this period, the age groups of 45-65 years had the highest 
incidence. Investigation into the joinpoint curve showed that the curve had a 
steep slope with an APC of 23.4% before the first joinpoint, but became milder 
after this. From 2005 to 2009, the APC was calculated as 2.7%, through which the 
incidence of breast cancer in 2020 was predicted as 63.0 per 100,000 women.
CONCLUSIONS: The age-adjusted incidence rate of breast cancer continues to 
increas in Iranian women. It is predicted that this trend will continue until 
2020. Therefore, it seems necessary to prioritize the prevention, control and 
care for breast cancer in Iran.

Tobacco use is a well-established risk factor for many types of cancers. Recent 
data on selected cancer incidence and mortality related to smoking in the 
Indonesian population are provided in this study. Morbidity and mortality data 
were derived from GLOBOCAN 2012 and the population attributable fraction (PAF) 
was estimated using the standard methodology developed by the World Health 
Organization. Using these data, we calculated disability adjusted life year 
(DALY) values for smoking-related cancer. The DALY was estimated by summation of 
the years lived with disability (YLD) and years life lost due to premature death 
(YLL). The cancer cases related to smoking in Indonesia numbered 45,132, 
accounting for 35,580 cancer deaths. The morbidity and mortality of lung cancer 
can be considered as the highest priority in both men and women. Furthermore the 
greatest YLD due to smoking in Indonesian men and women were from pancreas and 
lung cancers. For YLL among men, the highest years lost were from lung and liver 
cancers. On the other hand, among women lung oral cavity and lip were most 
important. Based on the DALY indicator, burden priorities for Indonesian men 
were lung cancer (298,980), liver cancer (60,367), and nasopharynx (46,185), 
while among Indonesian women they were lung cancer (34,119), cervix uteri 
(9,213) and pancreas cancer (5,433). In total, Indonesian burden of cancers 
attributed to smoking was 638,682 DALY. This study provides evidence about the 
burden of cancers caused by smoking as a rational basis for initiating national 
tobacco control policies in Indonesia.

BACKGROUND: The number of elderly patients with gastric cancer is continuing to 
increase along with the life expectancy of the general population. The purpose 
of this study was to investigate both the impact of age on postoperative outcome 
and the effect of limited lymph node dissection for elderly patients.
METHODS: Patients were classified into the following three groups: Group A, ≥80 
years old (n=44); Group B, 70-80 years old (n=139); Group C, <70 years old 
(n=219). Postoperative complication and survival rates were compared between the 
three groups Results: Limited lymph node dissection was performed significantly 
more frequently in Group A. In terms of surgery-related complications, no 
significant difference was seen between groups. In terms of general related 
complications, the complication rate increased with age, from 4% in Group C to 
13% in Group B and 14% in Group A (p<0.05 each). Although limited lymph node 
dissection was frequently performed in Group A, cancer-specific survival showed 
no significant difference in R0 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited lymph node dissection for gastric cancer did not affect the 
cancer-specific survival in elderly patients.

We performed a decision analysis comparing allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (allo-HCT) versus chemotherapy in first complete remission for 
patients with cytogenetically intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia, 
depending on the presence or absence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), 
nucleophosmin (NPM1), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) 
mutations. Adjusted means of the patient-reported EQ-5D index were used as 
quality-of-life (QOL) estimates. In 332 patients for which FLT3-ITD status was 
available, FLT3-ITD was present in 60. In 272 patients without FLT3-ITD, NPM1 
mutations were present in 83. CEBPA biallelic mutations were detected in 53 
patients. For patients harboring FLT3-ITD, allo-HCT improved life expectancy 
(LE) (52 versus 32 months during 10-year observation) and QOL-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE, 36 versus 21). Monte-Carlo simulation identified allo-HCT as 
the favored strategy in 100% of simulations. In patients without FLT3-ITD, 
allo-HCT improved LE/QALE with or without NPM1 mutations. However, sensitivity 
analyses showed that the results were not robust enough. For patients harboring 
CEBPA biallelic mutations, chemotherapy was favored (LE, 53 versus 84; QALE, 37 
versus 59), whereas, for patients with monoallelic mutations or wild-type CEBPA, 
allo-HCT was favored (LE, 68 versus 54; QALE, 48 versus 37). Sensitivity 
analyses did not change the results in either group. In conclusion, based on a 
Markov decision analysis, allo-HCT was a favored postremission strategy in 
patients with FLT3-ITD, and chemotherapy was favored in patients with biallelic 
CEBPA mutations. A prospective study is warranted to determine the value of 
allo-HCT, especially in FLT3-ITD-negative patients.

The microclimatic monitoring of the historic church of Mogiła Abbey (Kraków, 
Poland) was carried out to study the impact of the environmental parameters on 
the organic and hygroscopic artworks. Specific indexes were proposed to 
objectively assess the quality of time series of temperature (T), relative 
humidity (RH), and carbon dioxide (CO2) before applying the exploratory data 
analysis. The series were used to define the historic environmental conditions 
as stated in the European Standard EN 15757:2010 and with the use of the climate 
evaluation chart (CEC). It was found that the percentage of time in which T and 
RH values are within the allowable limits of the ASHRAE (2011) Class B is more 
than 85 %. This means that, for about 15 % of the time, there is a high risk of 
mechanical damage to highly vulnerable objects mainly due to the RH variability. 
The environment at the chancel resulted moister than that at the cornice, and 
the fungal growth is possible. In addition, the time-weighted preservation index 
(TWPI) is computed to evaluate the life expectancy of the objects, taking into 
account the environmental conditions of the site under study. The method of 
analogues, developed to predict the evolution of a system given observations of 
the past and without the knowledge of any equation among variables, was proposed 
and applied to the time series of temperature, relative humidity, and carbon 
dioxide with a 1-h sampling time to avoid the influence of the autocorrelation.

BACKGROUND: The objective was to estimate the incidence-based costs of treating 
β-thalassemia major (BTM) to the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) 
over the first 50 years of a patient's life in terms of healthcare resource use 
and corresponding costs and the associated health outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a modeling study based on information 
obtained from a systematic review of published literature and clinicians 
involved in managing BTM in the United Kingdom. A state transition model was 
constructed depicting the management of BTM over a period of 50 years. The model 
was used to estimate the incidence-based health economic impact that BTM imposes 
on the NHS and patients' health status in terms of the number of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 50 years.
RESULTS: The expected probability of survival at 50 years is 0.63. Of patients 
who survive, 33% are expected to be without any complication and the other 67% 
are expected to experience at least one complication. Patients' health status 
over this period was estimated to be a mean of 11.5 discounted QALYs per 
patient. Total healthcare expenditure attributable to managing BTM was estimated 
to be £483,454 ($720,201) at 2013/14 prices over 50 years. The cost of managing 
BTM could be potentially reduced by up to 37% if one in two patients had a bone 
marrow transplant, with an ensuing improvement in health-related quality of 
life.
CONCLUSION: This analysis provides the best estimate available of NHS resource 
use and costs with which to inform policy and budgetary decisions pertaining to 
this rare disease.

BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health challenge in tropical and 
semi-tropical countries in terms of high morbidity and mortality. The present 
study aimed to report the burden of malaria in Iran, extracted from the global 
burden of disease 2010 study (GBD 2010) covering the period 1990 to 2010, to 
compare these findings with similar results, and to present some recommendations 
as potential solutions for gaining more accurate estimations regarding the 
burden of the disease in Iran.
METHODS: Data covering the period from 1990 to 2010 were derived from the GBD 
2010, which is published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 
(IHME). The findings were used to estimate the years lived with disability 
(YLDs), the years of life lost (YLLs), the disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), and the death rate of malaria in Iran.
RESULTS: The GBD 2010 estimated that there was a sharp declining death trend 
with regard to DALYs and death rate, showing that 4,647.63 DALYs were due to 
malaria in Iranian people of all ages and both genders, and that DALYs per 
100,000 individuals declined from 37.15 in 1990 to 5.87 in 2010. The total 
number of malaria deaths over the 20 years was 73.37.
CONCLUSION: The findings revealed that the burden of malaria decreased 
remarkably between 1990 and 2010. The explanation for this decrease is the 
establishment of a malaria surveillance system in various parts of Iran, and 
utilization of proper intervention and the improvement of infrastructures, which 
play a role in disease transmission, especially in endemic areas.

Many corals form obligate symbioses with photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the 
genus Symbiodinium Freudenthal (1962). These symbionts vary genotypically, with 
their geographical distribution and abundance dependent upon host specificity 
and tolerance to temperature and light variation. Despite the importance of 
these mutualistic relationships, the physiology and ecology of Symbiodinium spp. 
remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that rDNA internal transcribed 
spacer region 2 (ITS2) defined Symbiodinium type B2 associates with the 
cnidarian hosts Astrangia poculata and Oculina arbuscula from northerly habitats 
of the western Atlantic. Using pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry, we 
compared maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII of type B2 to that of common 
tropical Symbiodinium lineages (types A3, B1, and C2) under cold-stress 
conditions. Symbiont cultures were gradually cooled from 26°C to 10°C to 
simulate seasonal temperature declines. Cold stress decreased the maximum 
photochemical efficiency of PSII and likely the photosynthetic potential for all 
Symbiodinium clades tested. Cultures were then maintained at 10°C for a 2-week 
period and gradually returned to initial conditions. Subsequent to low 
temperature stress, only type B2 displayed rapid and full recovery of PSII 
photochemical efficiency, whereas other symbiont phylotypes remained 
nonfunctional. These findings indicate that the distribution and abundance of 
Symbiodinium spp., and by extension their cnidarian hosts, in temperate climates 
correspond significantly with the photosynthetic cold tolerance of these 
symbiotic algae.

OBJECTIVE: When advising patients about possible initiation of primary 
prevention treatment, clinicians currently do not have information on expected 
impact on lifespan, nor how much this increment differs between individuals.
METHODS: First, UK cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality data were 
used to calculate the mean lifespan gain from an intervention (such as a statin) 
that reduces cardiovascular mortality by 30%. Second, a new method was developed 
to calculate the probability distribution of lifespan gain. Third, we performed 
a survey in three UK cities on 11 days between May-June 2014 involving 396 
participants (mean age 40 years, 55% male) to assess how individuals evaluate 
potential benefit from primary prevention therapies.
RESULTS: Among numerous identical patients, the lifespan gain, from an 
intervention that reduces cardiovascular mortality by 30%, is concentrated 
within an unpredictable minority. For example, men aged 50 years with national 
average cardiovascular risk have mean lifespan gain of 7 months. However, 93% of 
these identical individuals gain no lifespan, while the remaining 7% gain a mean 
of 99 months. Many survey respondents preferred a chance of large lifespan gain 
to the equivalent life expectancy gain given as certainty. Indeed, 33% preferred 
a 2% probability of 10 years to fivefold more gain, expressed as certainty of 
1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: People who gain lifespan from preventative therapy gain far more 
than the average for their risk stratum, even if perfectly defined. This may be 
important in patient decision-making. Looking beyond mortality reduction alone 
from preventative therapy, the benefits are likely to be even larger.

AIMS: To examine long-term healthcare utilization and costs of patients with 
stable coronary artery disease (SCAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Linked cohort study of 94 966 patients with SCAD in 
England, 1 January 2001 to 31 March 2010, identified from primary care, 
secondary care, disease, and death registries. Resource use and costs, and cost 
predictors by time and 5-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile were 
estimated using generalized linear models. Coronary heart disease 
hospitalizations were 20.5% in the first year and 66% in the year following a 
non-fatal (myocardial infarction, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke) event. Mean 
healthcare costs were £3133 per patient in the first year and £10 377 in the 
year following a non-fatal event. First-year predictors of cost included sex 
(mean cost £549 lower in females), SCAD diagnosis (non-ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction cost £656 more than stable angina), and co-morbidities (heart failure 
cost £657 more per patient). Compared with lower risk patients (5-year CVD risk 
3.5%), those of higher risk (5-year CVD risk 44.2%) had higher 5-year costs (£23 
393 vs. £9335) and lower lifetime costs (£43 020 vs. £116 888).
CONCLUSION: Patients with SCAD incur substantial healthcare utilization and 
costs, which varies and may be predicted by 5-year CVD risk profile. Higher risk 
patients have higher initial but lower lifetime costs than lower risk patients 
as a result of shorter life expectancy. Improved cardiovascular survivorship 
among an ageing CVD population is likely to require stratified care in 
anticipation of the burgeoning demand.

INTRODUCTION: Depending on developments in dialysis techniques and new treatment 
strategies for comorbid diseases, life expectancy has increased. As a result, 
dialysis related long term complications could be seen more frequently. We 
investigated and compared long term complications of the Haemodialysis (HD) and 
Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) in patients with history if either mode at least 
10years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 13HD & 16PD patients were included to the study. Basic 
demographic parameters and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), uraemic 
peripheral neuropathy (PNP), parathyroid adenoma, parathyroidectomy and acquired 
cystic disease (ACD) were assessed.
RESULTS: HD patients were older than PD patients (p=0.035) and duration of 
dialysis was longer in HD patients (p=0.001). CVD was present in 18 patients (9 
HD, 9 PD). There was no difference in presence of CVD between HD and PD patients 
(p=0.455). Valvular diseases (n=15), diastolic dysfunction (n=8), left 
ventricular hypertrophy (n=5), ischemic heart disease (n=3) and congestive heart 
failure (n=1) were investigated. Uraemic peripheral neuropathy was observed in 
14 of the patients (8 HD, 6 PD patients). Eight patients had mixed type sensory 
motor neuropathy and 3 patients had mixed type sensorial neuropathy, 2 patients 
had demyelinating PNP, 1 patient had axonal PNP and 3 of them had CTS related to 
peripheral neuropathy. Parathyroid adenoma was detected in 4 patients (2 HD, 2 
PD) and 3 patients (1 HD, 2 PD) had history of parathyroidectomy. Serum 
phosphate and iPTH levels were higher in HD patients (p=0.003, p=0.04, 
respectively). ACD was detected in 14 patients (7 HD, 7 PD). There was no 
difference between PD and HD patients (p=0.75).
CONCLUSION: HD patients were older than PD patients and had longer duration of 
dialysis. The prevalence of long term complications was similar in HD and PD 
modalities. CVD especially valvular diseases were common complication in both 
modalities.

Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is an uncommon condition that occurs mainly in 
chronically catheterized patient and associated with urinary tract infection. It 
is characterised by purple discolouration of urine bag which leads to 
significant stress and anxiety to patient, care takers and health workers, so 
awareness regarding this condition is of utmost importance. In our report, an 
old gentleman with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) on per urethral catheter 
(PUC) with past history of recurrent urinary tract infection developed burning 
micturition of urine with purple discoloration of urine bag. After proper 
antibiotic and catheter changed, discoloration subsided. In India, as life 
expectancy and geriatric care is improving, more patients are on PUC for various 
diseases. So, the incidence of PUBS will increase and awareness is required 
about the condition and its management.

Total hip arthroplasty is being increasingly indicated for younger and more 
active patients, in addition to a naturally growing demand for the procedure 
because of increasing life expectancy among patients. The high costs of this 
surgery and the controversies regarding implant performance have made this topic 
the subject of constant research, seeking new materials with better resistance 
to wear and better biocompatibility. The present article provides a review of 
new surfaces in total hip arthroplasty.

IMPORTANCE: Despite guidelines recommending against prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) screening in elderly men with limited life expectancy, PSA screening 
remains common.
OBJECTIVE: To identify clinician characteristics associated with PSA screening 
rates in older veterans stratified by life expectancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 826 286 veterans 65 
years or older eligible for PSA screening who had VA laboratory tests performed 
in 2011 in the VA health care system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percentage of men with a 
screening PSA test in 2011. Limited life expectancy was defined as age of at 
least 85 years with Charlson comorbidity score of 1 or greater or age of at 
least 65 years with Charlson comorbidity score of 4 or greater. Primary 
predictors were clinician characteristics including degree-training level, 
specialty, age, and sex. We performed log-linear Poisson regression models for 
the association between each clinician characteristic and PSA screening 
stratified by patient life expectancy and adjusted for patient demographics and 
clinician clustering.
RESULTS: In 2011, 466 017 (56%) of older veterans received PSA screening, 
including 39% of the 203 717 men with limited life expectancy. After adjusting 
for patient demographics, higher PSA screening rates in patients with limited 
life expectancy was associated with having a clinician who was an older man and 
was no longer in training. The PSA screening rates ranged from 27% for men with 
a physician trainee to 42% for men with an attending physician (P < .001); 22% 
for men with a geriatrician to 82% for men with a urologist as their clinician 
(P < .001); 29% for men with a clinician 35 years or younger to 41% for those 
with a clinician 56 years or older (P < .001); and 38% for men with a female 
clinician older than 55 years vs 43% for men with a male clinician older than 55 
years (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: More than one-third of men with limited life 
expectancy received PSA screening. Men whose clinician was a physician trainee 
had substantially lower PSA screening rates than those with an attending 
physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. Interventions to reduce 
PSA screening rates in older men with limited life expectancy should be designed 
and targeted to high-screening clinicians- older male, nontrainee clinicians-for 
greatest impact.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of 
hospital-acquired diarrhea in Australia. In 2013, a randomized controlled trial 
demonstrated the effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the 
treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The aim of this 
study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fecal microbiota 
transplantation-via either nasoduodenal or colorectal delivery-compared with 
vancomycin for the treatment of recurrent CDI in Australia.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of fecal 
microbiota transplantation compared with standard antibiotic therapy. A 
literature review of clinical evidence informed the structure of the model and 
the choice of parameter values. Clinical effectiveness was measured in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years. Uncertainty in the model was explored using 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Both nasoduodenal and colorectal FMT resulted in improved quality of 
life and reduced cost compared with vancomycin. The incremental effectiveness of 
either FMT delivery compared with vancomycin was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.3) 
quality-adjusted life years, or 1.4 (95% CI: 0.4, 2.4) life years saved. 
Treatment with vancomycin resulted in an increased cost of AU$4094 (95% CI: 
AU$26, AU$8161) compared with nasoduodenal delivery of FMT and AU$4045 (95% CI: 
-AU$33, AU$8124) compared with colorectal delivery. The mean difference in cost 
between colorectal and nasoduodenal FMT was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: If FMT, rather than vancomycin, became standard care for recurrent 
CDI in Australia, the estimated national healthcare savings would be over 
AU$4000 per treated person, with a substantial increase in quality of life.

The effect of aged litter materials on polyatomic ion concentrations in 
fractionated suspended particulate matter from a broiler house.

Inorganic emissions from livestock production and subsequent deposition of these 
ions can be a major source of pollution, causing nitrogen enrichment, 
eutrophication, acidification of soils and surface waters, and aerosol 
formation. In the poultry house, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide emissions can also 
adversely affect the health, performance, and welfare of both animals and human 
operators. The persistence and long life expectancy of ammonia, odors and toxic 
pollutants from poultry houses may be due to the ability of suspended 
particulate matter (SPM) to serve as carriers for odorous compounds such as 
ammonium ions and other inorganic compounds (e.g., phosphate, sulfate, nitrate, 
etc.). SPM is generated from the feed, animal manure, and the birds themselves. 
A large portion of odor associated with exhaust air from poultry houses is SPM 
that has absorbed odors from within the houses. Understanding the fate and 
transport processes of ammonia and other inorganic emissions in poultry houses 
is a necessary first step in utilizing the appropriate abatement strategies. In 
this study, the examination and characterization of ammonium ions, major 
components of odors and toxic gases from poultry operations, and other ions in 
suspended particulate matter in a broiler house were carried out using particle 
trap impactors. The SPM from the particle trap impactors was extracted and 
analyzed for its ionic species using ion chromatography (IC). The results showed 
concentrations of polyatomic ions in suspended particulate matter were found to 
increase with successive flocks and were highly concentrated in the larger size 
particulate matter. In addition, the ions concentrations appeared to reach a 
maximum at the middle of flock age (around the fourth week), tapering off toward 
the end in a given flock (possibly due to ventilation rates to cool off larger 
birds). Thus, it can be inferred that aged of bedding materials affects the 
ionic concentrations in aerosol particulate matter more than the age of the 
birds.
IMPLICATIONS: In the poultry house, toxic gas emissions can adversely affect the 
health, performance, and welfare of both animals and human operators. The 
persistence of these toxic pollutants from poultry houses may be due to the 
ability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) to serve as carriers for these 
compounds (inorganic ions). Our study showed that polyatomic ions in suspended 
particulate matter were found to increase with successive flocks and were highly 
concentrated in the larger size SPM. Understanding the effect of management 
practices on poultry air emissions will lead to innovative best management 
practices to safeguard the health and welfare of the animals as well as those of 
the poultry operators, along with reducing the impact of potential air pollution 
on the environment.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits of regular exercise in reducing harms 
associated with betel quid (BQ) chewing.
METHODS: The study cohort, 419,378 individuals, participated in a medical 
screening program between 1994 and 2008, with 38,324 male and 1,495 female 
chewers, who consumed 5-15 quids of BQ a day. Physical activity of each 
individual, based on "MET-hour/week", was classified as "inactive" or "active", 
where activity started from a daily 15 minutes/day or more of brisk walking 
(≥3.75 MET-hour/week). Hazard ratios for mortality and remaining years in life 
expectancy were calculated.
RESULTS: Nearly one fifth (18.7%) of men, but only 0.7% of women were chewers. 
Chewers had a 10-fold increase in oral cancer risk; and a 2-3-fold increase in 
mortality from lung, esophagus and liver cancer, cardiovascular disease, and 
diabetes, with doubling of all-cause mortality. More than half of chewers were 
physically inactive (59%). Physical activity was beneficial for chewers, with a 
reduction of all-cause mortality by 19%. Inactive chewers had their lifespan 
shortened by 6.3 years, compared to non-chewers, but being active, chewers 
improved their health by gaining 2.5 years. The improvement, however, fell short 
of offsetting the harms from chewing.
CONCLUSIONS: Chewers had serious health consequences, but being physically 
active, chewers could mitigate some of these adverse effects, and extend life 
expectancy by 2.5 years and reduce mortality by one fifth. Encouraging exercise, 
in addition to quitting chewing, remains the best advice for 1.5 million chewers 
in Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Breathlessness is the most common and intrusive symptom of advanced 
non-malignant respiratory and cardiac conditions. The Breathlessness 
Intervention Service (BIS) is a multi-disciplinary complex intervention, 
theoretically underpinned by a palliative care approach, utilising 
evidence-based non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to support 
patients with advanced disease in managing their breathlessness. Having 
published the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of BIS for patients with 
advanced cancer and their carers, we sought to establish its effectiveness, and 
cost effectiveness, in advanced non-malignant conditions.
METHODS: This was a single-centre Phase III fast-track single-blind mixed method 
RCT of BIS versus standard care for breathless patients with non-malignant 
conditions and their carers. Randomisation was to one of two groups (randomly 
permuted blocks). Eighty-seven patients referred to BIS were randomised 
(intervention arm n = 44; control arm n = 43 received BIS after four-week wait); 
79 (91 %) completed to key outcome measurement. The primary outcome measure was 
0-10 numeric rating scale for patient distress due to breathlessness at four 
weeks. Secondary outcome measures were Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Client Service Receipt Inventory, EQ-5D 
and topic-guided interviews.
RESULTS: Qualitative analyses showed the positive impact of BIS on patients with 
non-malignant conditions and their carers; quantitative analyses showed a 
non-significant greater reduction in the primary outcome ('distress due to 
breathlessness'), when compared to standard care, of -0.24 (95 % CI: -1.30, 
0.82). BIS resulted in extra mean costs of £799, reducing to £100 when outliers 
were excluded; neither difference was statistically significant. The 
quantitative findings contrasted with those previously reported for patients 
with cancer and their carers, which showed BIS to be both clinically and cost 
effective. For patients with non-malignant conditions there was a notable trend 
of improvement over both trial arms to the key measurement point; participants 
may have experienced a therapeutic effect from the research interviews, diluting 
the intervention's impact.
CONCLUSIONS: BIS had a statistically non-significant effect for patients with 
non-malignant conditions, and slightly increased service costs, but had a 
qualitatively positive impact consistent with findings for advanced cancer. 
Trials of palliative care interventions should consider multiple, mixed method, 
primary outcomes and ensure that protocols limit potential contaminating 
therapeutic effects in study designs.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: People with type 1 diabetes have reduced life expectancy (LE) 
compared with the general population. Our aim is to quantify mortality changes 
from 2002 to 2011 in people with type 1 diabetes in Sweden.
METHODS: This study uses health records from the Swedish National Diabetes 
Register (NDR) linked with death records. Abridged period life tables for those 
with type 1 diabetes aged 20 years and older were derived for 2002-06 and 
2007-11 using Chiang's method. Cox proportional hazard models were used to 
assess trends in overall and cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS: There were 27,841 persons aged 20 years and older identified in the NDR 
as living with type 1 diabetes between 2002 and 2011, contributing 194,685 
person-years of follow-up and 2,018 deaths. For men with type 1 diabetes, the 
remaining LE at age 20 increased significantly from 47.7 (95% CI 46.6, 48.9) in 
2002-06 to 49.7 years (95% CI 48.9, 50.6) in 2007-11. For women with type 1 
diabetes there was no significant change, with an LE at age 20 of 51.7 years 
(95% CI 50.3, 53.2) in 2002-06 and 51.9 years (95% CI 50.9, 52.9) in 2007-11. 
Cardiovascular mortality significantly reduced, with a per year HR of 0.947 (95% 
CI 0.917, 0.978) for men and 0.952 (95% CI 0.916, 0.989) for women.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: From 2002-06 to 2007-11 the LE at age 20 of Swedes 
with type 1 diabetes increased by approximately 2 years for men but minimally 
for women. These recent gains have been driven by reduced cardiovascular 
mortality.
