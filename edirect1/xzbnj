Growth hormone (GH) serves important roles in adult life, including maintenance 
of lean body mass and bone mass, promoting lipolysis, thereby limiting visceral 
adiposity, and regulating carbohydrate metabolism, cardiovascular system 
function, aerobic exercise capacity, and cognitive function. Younger adults with 
growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) exhibit abnormalities in body composition, 
physical and cognitive function, and quality of life which are reversed by GH 
replacement therapy. With advancing age GH production declines, paralleled by 
physical and functional alterations similar to those of AGHD; however, the 
degree to which the decrease in GH contributes to these age-related changes is 
unknown. Seemingly in opposition to the theory that the diminished GH secretion 
of older age is a net detriment are observations that animal models of 
congenital GH deficiency have remarkably increased life span and humans with 
congenital GH deficiency may have decreased rates of age-related diseases such 
as diabetes and cancer. Several short-term studies aiming to increase GH in 
older adults by a variety of interventions including exercise, administration of 
GH, or treatment with GH secretagogues have demonstrated consistent effects to 
improve body composition, yet inconsistent effects on physical and cognitive 
function. While side effects of GH administration in older adults include edema, 
arthralgias, and elevated blood glucose, data regarding the possible long-term 
effects on “hard end points” such as risk of fractures, cancer, cardiovascular 
disease, life expectancy, and mortality are lacking. For complete coverage of

OBJECTIVES: We investigated changes in life expectancy (LE) and cause-specific 
mortality over time, directly comparing African-descent populations in the 
United States and the Caribbean.
METHODS: We compared LE at birth and cause-specific mortality in 6 disease 
groups between Caribbean countries with a majority (> 90%) African-descent 
population and US African Americans.
RESULTS: The LE improvement among African Americans exceeded that of 
Afro-Caribbeans so that the LE gap, which favored the Caribbean population by 
1.5 years in 1990, had been reversed by 2009. This relative improvement among 
African Americans was mainly the result of the improving mortality experience of 
African American men. Between 2000 and 2009, Caribbean mortality rates in 5 of 
the 6 disease groups increased relative to those of African Americans. By 2009, 
mortality from cerebrovascular diseases, cancers, and diabetes was higher in 
Afro-Caribbeans relative to African Americans, with a diabetes mortality rate 
twice that of African Americans and 4 times that of White Americans.
CONCLUSIONS: The Caribbean community made important mortality reductions between 
2000 and 2009, but this progress fell short of African American health 
improvements in the same period, especially among men.

It is believed that patients' expectancies about the effectiveness of treatment 
influence their treatment outcomes, but the working mechanism is rarely studied 
in patients with low back pain. Theoretical models suggest that adherence to 
treatment may be an important pathway. The aim of this study was to assess the 
mediating role of adherence to treatment in the relationship between 
expectancies and the outcomes of recovery and pain intensity in patients with 
acute low back pain. This study used data from a randomized placebo-controlled 
trial of paracetamol for acute low back pain. Expectancies were measured with 
the Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire. Adherence was measured with a 
medication diary. Pain intensity was recorded daily in a diary on a 0 to 10 pain 
scale, and recovery was defined as the first of 7 consecutive days scoring 0 or 
1 on a 6-point pain scale. Cox regression (dependent variable: recovery) and 
linear mixed-model analyses (dependent variable: daily pain intensity scores) 
were performed. The "difference in coefficients" approach was used to establish 
mediation. A total of 1573 participants were included in current analyses. There 
was a small but highly significant relationship between expectancies and 
outcomes; 3.3% of the relationship between expectancies and recovery and 14.2% 
of the relationship between expectancies and pain intensity were mediated by 
adherence to treatment. This study does not convincingly support the theory that 
adherence is a key pathway in the relationship between treatment outcome 
expectancies and recovery and pain intensity in this acute low back pain 
population.

BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we provided evidence that a decline in fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution during the period between 2000 and 2007 
was associated with increased life expectancy in 545 counties in the United 
States. In this article, we investigated which chemical constituents of PM2.5 
were the main drivers of the observed association.
METHODS: We estimated associations between temporal changes in seven major 
components of PM2.5 (ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, elemental carbon matter, 
organic carbon matter, sodium, and silicon) and temporal changes in life 
expectancy in 95 counties between 2002 and 2007. We included US counties that 
had adequate chemical components of PM2.5 mass data across all seasons. We 
fitted single pollutant and multiple pollutant linear models, controlling for 
available socioeconomic, demographic, and smoking variables and stratifying by 
urban and nonurban counties.
RESULTS: In multiple pollutant models, we found that: (1) a reduction in sulfate 
was associated with an increase in life expectancy; and (2) reductions in 
ammonium and sodium ion were associated with increases in life expectancy in 
nonurban counties only.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that recent reductions in long-term exposure 
to sulfate, ammonium, and sodium ion between 2002 and 2007 are associated with 
improved public health.

BACKGROUND: Non-specific low back pain (LBP) has been one of the most frequently 
occurring musculoskeletal problems. Impairment in the mechanical stability of 
the lumbar spine has been known to lower the safety margin of the spine 
musculature and can result in the occurrence of pain symptoms of the low back 
area. Previously, changes in spinal stability have been identified by 
investigating recruitment patterns of low back and abdominal muscles in 
laboratory experiments with controlled postures and physical activities that 
were hard to conduct in daily life. The main objective of this study was to 
explore the possibility of developing a reliable spine stability assessment 
method using surface electromyography (EMG) of the low back and abdominal 
muscles in common physical activities.
METHODS: Twenty asymptomatic young participants conducted normal walking, plank, 
and isometric back extension activities prior to and immediately after 
maintaining a 10-min static upper body deep flexion on a flat bed. EMG data of 
the erector spinae, external oblique, and rectus abdominals were collected 
bilaterally, and their mean normalized amplitude values were compared between 
before and after the static deep flexion. Changes in the amplitude and 
co-contraction ratio values were evaluated to understand how muscle recruitment 
patterns have changed after the static deep flexion.
RESULTS: Mean normalized amplitude of antagonist muscles (erector spinae muscles 
while conducting plank; external oblique and rectus abdominal muscles while 
conducting isometric back extension) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after 
the 10-min static deep flexion. Normalized amplitude of agonist muscles did not 
vary significantly after deep flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest the possibility of using surface EMG 
in the evaluation of spinal stability and low back health status in simple 
exercise postures that can be done in non-laboratory settings. Specifically, 
amplitude of antagonist muscles was found to be more sensitive than agonist 
muscles in identifying changes in the spinal stability associated with the 
10-min static deep flexion. Further research with various loading conditions and 
physical activities need to be performed to improve the reliability and utility 
of the findings of the current study.

AIM: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is carried out commonly for 
patients with dysphagia. Clinicians, however, are often reluctant to carry out 
PEG in the elderly because of concerns about complications and short life 
expectancy. The present study aimed to assess the safety of PEG in elderly 
patients.
METHODS: The medical records of 116 patients who received PEG from October 2005 
to May 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, 63 patients were aged 65 
years and older (the elderly group), and 53 were aged less than 65 years (the 
younger group).
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics showed no significant difference in both 
groups, except that pulmonary comorbidities was more common in the elderly group 
(P = 0.003). Overall, PEG-related complications occurred in 23 (19.8%) patients. 
Wound infections were the most common (15 patients), and followed by 
gastrointestinal bleeding, esophageal injury, pneumomediastinum and buried 
bumper syndrome. Although there was no difference in the overall complications, 
wound infections were less frequent in the elderly group than in the younger 
group (4 [6.3%] out of 63 vs 11 [20.8%] out of 53, P = 0.027). There were 17 
(14.7%) cases of mortality, with three patients (2.5%) dying within 30 days 
after the procedure and the causes of deaths were unrelated to PEG. No 
significant difference in mortality rate was observed between the two groups (13 
[20.6%] vs 4 [7.5%], P = 0.065).
CONCLUSIONS: PEG can be carried out safely in elderly patients, as 
procedure-related complications and mortality did not increase compared with 
those of younger patients.

Cell division plays an important role in animal tissue morphogenesis, which 
depends, critically, on the orientation of divisions. In isolated adherent 
cells, the orientation of mitotic spindles is sensitive to interphase cell shape 
and the direction of extrinsic mechanical forces. In epithelia, the relative 
importance of these two factors is challenging to assess. To do this, we used 
suspended monolayers devoid of ECM, where divisions become oriented following a 
stretch, allowing the regulation and function of epithelial division orientation 
in stress relaxation to be characterized. Using this system, we found that 
divisions align better with the long, interphase cell axis than with the 
monolayer stress axis. Nevertheless, because the application of stretch induces 
a global realignment of interphase long axes along the direction of extension, 
this is sufficient to bias the orientation of divisions in the direction of 
stretch. Each division redistributes the mother cell mass along the axis of 
division. Thus, the global bias in division orientation enables cells to act 
collectively to redistribute mass along the axis of stretch, helping to return 
the monolayer to its resting state. Further, this behavior could be 
quantitatively reproduced using a model designed to assess the impact of 
autonomous changes in mitotic cell mechanics within a stretched monolayer. In 
summary, the propensity of cells to divide along their long axis preserves 
epithelial homeostasis by facilitating both stress relaxation and isotropic 
growth without the need for cells to read or transduce mechanical signals.

Four Ways Life Extension will Change Our Relationship with Death.

Davis JK.

Discussions of life extension ethics have focused mainly on whether an extended 
life would be desirable to have, and on the social consequences of widely 
available life extension. I want to explore a different range of issues: four 
ways in which the advent of life extension will change our relationship with 
death, not only for those who live extended lives, but also for those who cannot 
or choose not to. Although I believe that, on balance, the reasons in favor of 
developing life extension outweigh the reasons against doing so (something I 
won't argue for here), most of these changes probably count as reasons against 
doing so. First, the advent of life extension will alter the human condition for 
those who live extended lives, and not merely by postponing death. Second, it 
will make death worse for those who lack access to life extension, even if those 
people live just as long as they do now. Third, for those who have access to 
life extension but prefer to live a normal lifespan because they think that has 
advantages, the advent of life extension will somewhat reduce some of those 
advantages, even if they never use life extension. Fourth, refusing life 
extension turns out to be a form of suicide, and this will force those who have 
access to life extension but turn it down to choose between an extended life 
they don't want and a form of suicide they may (probably mistakenly) consider 
immoral.

BACKGROUND: This study investigates the use of an information and communication 
technology (Elder Tree) designed for older adults and their informal caregivers 
to improve older adult quality of life and address challenges older adults face 
in maintaining their independence (for example, loneliness and isolation, 
falling, managing medications, driving and transportation).
METHODS/DESIGN: This study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial, will 
evaluate the effectiveness and cost of Elder Tree. Older adults who are at risk 
for losing their independence - along with their informal caregivers, if they 
name them - are randomized to two groups. The intervention group has access to 
their usual sources of information and communication as well as to Elder Tree 
for 18 months while the control group uses only their usual sources of 
information and communication. The primary outcome of the study is older adult 
quality of life. Secondary outcomes are cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year and 
the impact of the technology on independence, loneliness, falls, medication 
management, driving and transportation, and caregiver appraisal and mastery. We 
will also examine the mediating effect of self-determination theory. We will 
evaluate the effectiveness of Elder Tree by comparing intervention- and 
control-group participants at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18. We will use 
mixed-effect models to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes, where 
pretest score functions as a covariate, treatment condition is a 
between-subjects factor, and the multivariate outcome reflects scores for a 
given assessment at the three time points. Separate analyses will be conducted 
for each outcome. Cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year will be compared between 
the intervention and control groups. Additional analyses will examine the 
mediating effect of self-determination theory on each outcome.
DISCUSSION: Elder Tree is a multifaceted intervention, making it a challenge to 
assess which services or combinations of services account for outcomes in which 
subsets of older adults. If Elder Tree can improve quality of life and reduce 
healthcare costs among older adults, it could suggest a promising way to ease 
the burden that advancing age can place on older adults, their families, and the 
healthcare system.

BACKGROUND: Accelerated aging has been proposed as a mechanism explaining the 
increased prevalence of comorbid general medical illnesses in bipolar disorder.
AIMS: To test the hypothesis that lost life years due to natural causes starts 
in early and mid-adulthood, supporting the hypothesis of accelerated aging.
METHODS: Using individual data from nationwide registers of patient with a 
diagnosis of bipolar disorder we calculated remaining life expectancies before 
age 90 years for values of age 15, 25, 35…75 years among all individuals alive 
in year 2000. Further, we estimated the reduction in life expectancy due to 
natural causes (physical illnesses) and unnatural causes (suicide and accidents) 
in relation to age.
RESULTS: A total of 22,635 patients with bipolar disorder were included in the 
study in addition to data from the entire Danish general population of 5.4 
million people. At age 15 years, remaining life expectancy before age 90 years 
was decreased 12.7 and 8.9 life years, respectively, for men and women with 
bipolar disorder. For 15-year old boys with bipolar disorder, natural causes 
accounted for 58% of all lost life years and for 15-year old girls, natural 
causes accounted for 67% increasing to 74% and 80% for 45-year old men and 
women, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: Data concern patients who get contact to hospital psychiatry only.
CONCLUSIONS: Natural causes of death is the most prevalent reason for lost life 
years already from adolescence and increases substantially during early and 
mid-adulthood, in this way supporting the hypothesis of accelerated aging. Early 
intervention in bipolar disorder should not only focus on improving outcome of 
the bipolar disorder but also on decreasing the risk of comorbid general medical 
illnesses.

Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome) is a rare multisystem disorder 
associated with an excess risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Because 
life expectancy is limited, few reports consider the perioperative management of 
familial dysautonomia in adults with advanced disease and end-organ dysfunction. 
Here, we report on the management of an adult patient with familial 
dysautonomia, highlighting recent developments in perioperative technology and 
pharmacology of special relevance to this challenging population.

BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition 
syndrome caused by mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 
and PMS2. Individuals with Lynch syndrome have an increased risk of colorectal 
cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian and other cancers. Lynch syndrome remains 
underdiagnosed in the UK. Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in early-onset 
colorectal cancer patients is proposed as a method to identify more families 
affected by Lynch syndrome and offer surveillance to reduce cancer risks, 
although cost-effectiveness is viewed as a barrier to implementation. The 
objective of this project was to estimate the cost-utility of strategies to 
identify Lynch syndrome in individuals with early-onset colorectal cancer in the 
NHS.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed which simulated diagnostic and 
long-term outcomes over a lifetime horizon for colorectal cancer patients with 
and without Lynch syndrome and for relatives of those patients. Nine diagnostic 
strategies were modelled which included microsatellite instability (MSI) 
testing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), BRAF mutation testing (methylation testing 
in a scenario analysis), diagnostic mutation testing and Amsterdam II criteria. 
Biennial colonoscopic surveillance was included for individuals diagnosed with 
Lynch syndrome and accepting surveillance. Prophylactic hysterectomy with 
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (H-BSO) was similarly included for women 
diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. Costs from NHS and Personal Social Services 
perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated and 
discounted at 3.5% per annum.
RESULTS: All strategies included for the identification of Lynch syndrome were 
cost-effective versus no testing. The strategy with the greatest net health 
benefit was MSI followed by BRAF followed by diagnostic genetic testing, costing 
£5,491 per QALY gained over no testing. The effect of prophylactic H-BSO on 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is uncertain and could outweigh the 
health benefits of testing, resulting in overall QALY loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in early-onset colorectal cancer 
patients is predicted to be a cost-effective use of limited financial resources 
in England and Wales. Research is recommended into the cost-effectiveness of 
reflex testing for Lynch syndrome in other associated cancers and into the 
impact of prophylactic H-BSO on HRQoL.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease in 
the white population. Mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator 
gene on chromosome 7 results in production of abnormally viscous mucus and 
secretions in the lungs of patients with CF. A similar pathologic process occurs 
in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and hepatobiliary system. Inspissated 
mucus causes luminal obstruction and resultant clinical and radiologic 
complications associated with the disease process. Pancreatic involvement can 
result in exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, pancreatic atrophy, fatty 
replacement, or lipomatous pseudohypertrophy. Acute and chronic pancreatitis, 
pancreatic calcification, cysts, and cystosis also occur. Hepatic manifestations 
include hepatic steatosis, focal biliary and multilobular cirrhosis, and portal 
hypertension. Biliary complications include cholelithiasis, microgallbladder, 
and sclerosing cholangitis. The entire digestive tract can be involved. Distal 
ileal obstruction syndrome, intussusception, appendicitis, chronic constipation, 
colonic wall thickening, fibrosing colonopathy, pneumatosis intestinalis, 
gastroesophageal reflux, and peptic ulcer disease have been described. Renal 
manifestations include nephrolithiasis and secondary amyloidosis. The 
educational objectives of this review are to reveal the abdominal manifestations 
of CF to facilitate focused analysis of cross-sectional imaging in adult 
patients. Life expectancy in patients with CF continues to improve because of a 
combination of aggressive antibiotic treatment, improved emphasis on nutrition 
and physiotherapy, and development of promising new CF transmembrane conductance 
regulator modulators. As lung function and survival improve, extrapulmonary 
conditions, including hepatic and gastrointestinal malignancy, will be an 
increasing cause of morbidity and mortality. Awareness of the expected abdominal 
manifestations of CF may assist radiologists in identifying acute inflammatory 
or neoplastic conditions. (©)RSNA, 2015.

BACKGROUND: Given the high importance of dietary sodium (salt) as a global 
disease risk factor, our objective was to compare the impact of eight sodium 
reduction interventions, including feasible and more theoretical ones, to assist 
prioritisation.
METHODS: Epidemiological modelling and cost-utility analysis were performed 
using a Markov macro-simulation model. The setting was New Zealand (NZ) (2.3 
million citizens, aged 35+ years) which has detailed individual-level 
administrative cost data.
RESULTS: Of the most feasible interventions, the largest health gains were from 
(in descending order): (i) mandatory 25% reduction in sodium levels in all 
processed foods; (ii) the package of interventions performed in the United 
Kingdom (UK); (iii) mandatory 25% reduction in sodium levels in bread, processed 
meats and sauces; (iv) media campaign (as per a previous UK one); (v) voluntary 
food labelling as currently used in NZ; (vi) dietary counselling as currently 
used in NZ. Even larger health gains came from the more theoretical options of a 
"sinking lid" on the amount of food salt released to the national market to 
achieve an average adult intake of 2300 mg sodium/day (211,000 QALYs gained, 95% 
uncertainty interval: 170,000-255,000), and from a salt tax. All the 
interventions produced net cost savings (except counseling--albeit still 
cost-effective). Cost savings were especially large with the sinking lid (NZ$ 
1.1 billion, US$ 0.7 billion). Also the salt tax would raise revenue (up to NZ$ 
452 million/year). Health gain per person was greater for Māori (indigenous 
population) men and women compared to non-Māori.
CONCLUSIONS: This study substantially expands on the range of previously 
modelled salt reduction interventions and suggests that some of these might 
achieve major health gains and major cost savings (particularly the regulatory 
interventions). They could also reduce ethnic inequalities in health.

Sciences, Lucknow, India. thakral_anuj@yahoo.com.

Considering the high incidence of amoebic and pyogenic liver abscess in the 
developing world, occurrence of inferior vena cava thrombosis secondary to liver 
abscess is a rare but life threatening complication. We report 4 such 
complicated cases of liver abscess(s). The first case involved a large caudate 
lobe abscess extending across middle hepatic vein into suprahepatic inferior 
vena cava (IVC). Development of a left hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm following 
attempted percutaneous aspiration highlights the difficulties encountered in 
percutaneous interventional management of caudate lobe abscesses. The second 
case involved multiple liver abscesses with large thrombus in the right 
ventricular cavity & right ventricular outflow tract. The patient developed 
cardiorespiratory arrest limiting any aggressive management options for the 
complex nature of illness. The third case had a large caudate lobe abscess with 
direct extension into Intrahepatic IVC while the fourth showed a segment 4 
abscess with thrombosis of adjacent left hepatic vein. These cases highlight the 
fact that diagnosis of such life threatening complications of liver abscesses as 
hepatic vein & IVC thrombosis requires high clinical suspicion followed by 
targeted imaging. Image guided interventional therapy is a useful tool for 
management in cases of liver abscess. But, abscesses in precarious locations 
like caudate lobe are associated with higher risk of complications including 
pseudoaneurysm formation asking for a cautious approach to interventional 
therapy in such circumstances.

Despite dedicated efforts to identify interventions to delay aging, most 
promising interventions yielding dramatic life-span extension in animal models 
of aging are often ineffective when translated to clinical trials. This may be 
due to differences in primary outcomes between species and difficulties in 
determining the optimal clinical trial paradigms for translation. Measures of 
physical function, including brief standardized testing batteries, are currently 
being proposed as biomarkers of aging in humans, are predictive of adverse 
health events, disability, and mortality, and are commonly used as functional 
outcomes for clinical trials. Motor outcomes are now being incorporated into 
preclinical testing, a positive step toward enhancing our ability to translate 
aging interventions to clinical trials. To further these efforts, we begin a 
discussion of physical function and disability assessment across species, with 
special emphasis on mice, rats, monkeys, and man. By understanding how physical 
function is assessed in humans, we can tailor measurements in animals to better 
model those outcomes to establish effective, standardized translational 
functional assessments with aging.

BACKGROUND: Metachronous penile metastasis of bladder cancer occurs very rarely. 
The clinical management of the disease involves complex problems, and the 
disease is associated with a poor prognosis. The common mode of spread to the 
penis is by the retrograde venous route.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 68-year-old patient who was diagnosed with invasive 
bladder cancer underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron-emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for staging purposes. An 18mm 
intracavernosal metastatic lesion was detected in the penis with a SUVmax of 
12.9.
RESULTS: After the administration of gemcitabine+cisplatin-based chemotherapy, 
remission was observed in the metastatic penile lesion according to EORTC 
criteria (12mm, SUVmax: 9), and second line chemotherapy program was planned.
CONCLUSION: Penile metastasis from bladder cancer is an indicator of poor 
prognosis. The patients with penile metastasis poorly respond to therapy, 
despite the use of effective systemic chemotherapy. The researchers of the 
current study achieved a partial response to chemotherapy in the current case of 
penile metastasis. The disease-specific life expectancy is less than one year in 
these patients. Radical ablative surgery does not contribute to survival; 
however, it offers an alternative method in symptomatic patients.

BACKGROUND: The consequences of non-fatal road traffic injuries (RTI) are 
increasingly adopted by policy makers as an indicator of traffic safety. 
However, it is not agreed upon which level of severity should be used as cut-off 
point for assessing road safety performance. Internationally, within road 
safety, injury severity is assessed by means of the maximum abbreviated injury 
scale (MAIS). The choice for a severity cut-off point highly influences the 
measured disease burden of RTI. This paper assesses the burden of RTI in terms 
of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) by hospitalization status and MAIS 
cut-off point in the Netherlands.
METHODS: Hospital discharge register (HDR) and emergency department (ED) data 
for RTI in the Netherlands were selected for the years 2007-2009, as well as 
mortality data. The incidence, years lived with disability (YLD), years of life 
lost (YLL) owing to premature death, and DALYs were calculated. YLD for admitted 
patients was subdivided by MAIS severity levels.
RESULTS: RTI resulted in 48,500 YLD and 27,900 YLL respectively, amounting to 
76,400 DALYs per year in the Netherlands. The largest proportion of DALYs is 
related to fatalities (37%), followed by admitted MAIS 2 injuries (25%), ED 
treated injuries (16%) and admitted MAIS 3+ injuries (18%). Admitted MAIS 1 
injuries only account for a small fraction of DALYs (4%). In the Netherlands, 
the diseases burden of RTI is highest among cyclists with 39% of total DALYs. 
One half of all bicycle related DALYs are attributable to admitted MAIS 2+ 
injuries, but ED treated injuries also account for a large proportion of DALYs 
in this group (28%). Car occupants are responsible for 26% of all DALYs, 
primarily caused by fatalities (66%), followed by admitted MAIS 2+ injuries 
(25%). ED treated injuries only account for 5% of DALYs in this group.
CONCLUSIONS: When using admitted MAIS 3+ or admitted MAIS 2+ as severity cut-off 
point, 54% and 80% of all DALYs are captured respectively. Assessing the 
influence of different severity cut-off points by MAIS on the proportion and 
number of DALYs captured gives valuable information for guiding choices on the 
definition of serious RTI.

INTRODUCTION: Research suggests that survival among the recipients of a cardiac 
permanent pacemaker (PPM) matches the age- and sex-matched general population in 
the absence of cardiovascular disease. We used linked administrative data to 
examine life expectancy-based outcomes for adults requiring a cardiac PPM.
METHODS: Population-level hospital admissions data were used to identify all 
recipients of an initial PPM during 1995-2008. Expected years of additional life 
remaining at the time of implantation were calculated for each patient from 
population life tables. Observed years were calculated using linked mortality 
data to end 2011. Cox regression was used to determine demographic and clinical 
predictors of survival.
RESULTS: In 8757 patients age-adjusted risk of death to 5 years was associated 
with male sex, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score (excluding cardiac 
disease), a history of heart failure, cardiomyopathy or atrial fibrillation and 
emergency admission. Coronary revascularisation surgery reduced long-term risk. 
The observed/expected ratio of additional years of life was 0.80 for men and 
0.84 for women overall, varying from 0.92 for women without significant 
comorbidity to 0.40 for patients with the highest Charlson score and 
cardiomyopathy. The oldest patients (80-99 years) did relatively well, probably 
reflecting patient selection. Heart disease was the most frequent cause of 
death.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy among PPM recipients without significant 
comorbidity approached that of the general population. Greater non-cardiac 
comorbidity, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and, in particular, 
cardiomyopathy, contributed most to the loss of expected years of life in all 
age groups. The oldest patients and women did relatively well.
