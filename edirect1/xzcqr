using the EQ-5D-5L. Bootstrap, sensitivity, and sub-group analyses were 
performed to determine the robustness of the findings. Results: The two groups 
of 79 patients were similar in baseline characteristics. The base case ICER is 
situated in the northeast quadrant (€72 (40.74/€2,948)) due to a higher MSSES 
Control score and higher societal costs in the CDT group. The ICUR is situated 
in the northwest (inferior) quadrant due to losses in QALY and higher societal 
costs for the CDT group (-0.02/€2,948). Overall, bootstrap, sensitivity, and 
sub-group analyses confirm the base case findings. However, when the SF-6D is 
used as a study outcome, there is a high probability that the ICUR is situated 
in the northeast quadrant. Limitations: The relative short follow-up time 
(6 months) and the unexpected increase in MSSES Control in the control group. 
Conclusions: When using the EQ-5D-5L to calculate a QALY, CDT is not a 
cost-effective alternative in comparison to care as usual. However, when using 
self-efficacy or SF-6D as outcomes, there is a probability that CDT is 
cost-effective. Based on the current results, CDT for patients with RRMS clearly 
show its potential. However, an extended follow-up for the economic evaluation 
is warranted before a final decision on implementation can be made.

Objective: To compare the effects of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) and 
extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) on lateral epicondylitis (LE). 
Background: Although several authors have investigated the effects of PBMT and 
ESWT on LE, only one study to date has compared ESWT with PBMT. Ours is also the 
first study assessing patient satisfaction levels and quality of life in 
addition to comparing the two methods. Methods: Forty-three patients were 
randomly divided into two groups: 23 (mean age: 48.2 ± 9.4; 17 female, 6 male) 
were included in the PBMT group and 20 (mean age: 48.0 ± 9.9; 15 female, 5 male) 
in the ESWT group. PBMT was applied three times a week for 4 weeks, and ESWT 
once a week for 4 weeks. Stretching and eccentric strengthening exercises were 
also given to both groups as a home program. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score 
and disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) were used for evaluating 
upper extremity functions. Pain intensity was evaluated using a visual analog 
scale (VAS), and muscle strengths were also assessed using a hand-held 
dynamometer. The 12-Item Short Form (SF-12) Survey Physical and Mental Component 
Scales were used to evaluate quality of life, and the global rating of change 
scale to evaluate patient satisfaction. Patients were assessed before treatment 
and at 12-week follow-up. Results: Improvements for elbow extension and shoulder 
flexion strength and for VAS movement were observed only in the PBMT group, 
whereas improvement of handgrip strength was present in both groups (p < 0.05). 
However, handgrip strength was superior in the PBMT group than in the ESWT group 
(p = 0.02). Conclusions: Both PBMT and ESWT are useful and can be used in the 
treatment of LE.

BACKGROUND: Untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) affects the care of HIV/HCV 
co-infected people who inject opioids. Despite active injection opioid use, 
there is evidence of increasing engagement in HIV care and adherence to HIV 
medications among HIV/HCV co-infected persons. However, less than one-half of 
this population is offered HCV treatment onsite. Treatment for OUD is also rare 
and largely occurs offsite. Integrating buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) into 
onsite care for HIV/HCV co-infected persons may improve outcomes, but the 
clinical impact and costs are unknown. We evaluated the clinical impact, costs, 
and cost-effectiveness of integrating (BUP-NX) into onsite HIV/HCV treatment 
compared with the status quo of offsite referral for medications for OUD.
METHODS: We used a Monte Carlo microsimulation of HCV to compare two strategies 
for people who inject opioids: 1) standard HIV care with onsite HCV treatment 
and referral to offsite OUD care (status quo) and 2) standard HIV care with 
onsite HCV and BUP-NX treatment (integrated care). Both strategies assume that 
all individuals are already in HIV care. Data from national databases, clinical 
trials, and cohorts informed model inputs. Outcomes included mortality, HCV 
reinfection, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2017 US dollars), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Integrated care reduced HCV reinfections by 7%, cases of cirrhosis by 
1%, and liver-related deaths by 3%. Compared to the status quo, this strategy 
also resulted in an estimated 11/1,000 fewer non-liver attributable deaths at 
one year and 28/1,000 fewer of these deaths at five years, at a 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $57,100/QALY. Integrated care remained 
cost-effective in sensitivity analyses that varied the proportion of the 
population actively injecting opioids, availability of BUP-NX, and quality of 
life weights.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating BUP-NX for OUD into treatment for HIV/HCV co-infected 
adults who inject opioids increases life expectancy and is cost-effective at a 
$100,000/QALY threshold.

PURPOSE: Health care expenditures and biomedical research funding are often 
justified by the belief that modern health care powerfully improves life 
expectancy in wealthy countries. We examined 4 different methods of estimating 
the effect of health care on health outcomes.
METHODS: We reviewed the contributions of medical care to health outcomes using 
4 methods: (1) analyses by McGinnis and Schroeder, (2) Wennberg and colleagues' 
studies of small area variation, (3) Park and colleagues' analysis of County 
Health Rankings and Roadmaps, and (4) the RAND Health Insurance Experiment.
RESULTS: The 4 methods, using different data sets, produced estimates ranging 
from 0% to 17% of premature mortality attributable to deficiencies in health 
care access or delivery. Estimates of the effect of behavioral factors ranged 
from 16% to 65%.
CONCLUSIONS: The results converge to suggest that restricted access to medical 
care accounts for about 10% of premature death or other undesirable health 
outcomes. Health care has modest effects on the extension of US life expectancy, 
while behavioral and social determinants may have larger effects.

STUDY DESIGN: Economic modelling analysis.
OBJECTIVES: To determine lifetime direct and indirect costs from initial 
hospitalisation of all expected new traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord 
injuries (SCI) over 12 months.
SETTING: United Kingdom (UK).
METHODS: Incidence-based approach to assessing costs from a societal 
perspective, including immediate and ongoing health, rehabilitation and 
long-term care directly attributable to SCI, as well as aids and adaptations, 
unpaid informal care and participation in employment. The model accounts for 
differences in injury severity, gender, age at onset and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Lifetime costs for an expected 1270 new cases of SCI per annum 
conservatively estimated as £1.43 billion (2016 prices). This equates to a mean 
£1.12 million (median £0.72 million) per SCI case, ranging from £0.47 million 
(median £0.40 million) for an AIS grade D injury to £1.87 million (median £1.95 
million) for tetraplegia AIS A-C grade injuries. Seventy-one percent of lifetime 
costs potentially are paid by the public purse with remaining costs due to 
reduced employment and carer time.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the magnitude of costs, and being comparable with 
international estimates, this first analysis of SCI costs in the UK is likely to 
be conservative. Findings are particularly sensitive to the level and costs of 
long-term home and residential care. The analysis demonstrates how modelling can 
be used to highlight economic impacts of SCI rapidly to policymakers, illustrate 
how changes in future patterns of injury influence costs and help inform future 
economic evaluations of actions to prevent and/or reduce the impact of SCIs.

Brassica rapa or B. napus vegetables for eating as young inflorescences and 
stalks are called "nabana". Japanese nabana includes "flower-bud type" and 
"stem-and-leaf type". Chinese and European types are also known (cai-xin, 
zicaitai, and broccoletto). We classified nabana belonging to B. rapa and other 
B. rapa vegetables. In a simple sequence repeat-based phylogram, 49 ingroup 
samples were classified into four groups (I-IV). Flower-bud and stem-and-leaf 
types were separated into groups I and III, respectively, with a slight overlap 
in group II. Cai-xin and non-heading Chinese cabbages were included in group IV. 
Broccoletto was placed in group III, close to turnips. Zicaitai cultivars were 
included in group II. We tested for clubroot resistance (CR) and its marker 
genotypes in nabana because of their agronomical importance. Ten cultivars were 
resistant to group 4 pathogen but not to group 2. Most of the CR cultivars had 
heterozygous resistance alleles in the CRb and Crr1 loci, consistent with 
inoculation tests. Our results suggest that Japanese nabana lines and foreign 
types were differentiated according to their consumption parts and cultivar 
origins, respectively. This study elucidates the relationships and CR properties 
of nabana and provides valuable information for the breeding of nabana 
cultivars.

Permanent central vein catheter for hemodialysis is a choice for hemodialysis 
vascular access. Permanent dialysis catheters may be inserted through the 
jugular, subclavian and femoral veins. It may be inserted when the patient have 
short life expectancy or not suitable for fistula operation. There may be so 
many complications for example malposition, hemorrhage and pneumothorax while 
inserting central venous catheter. Here we present a 44 year old female 
hemodialysis patient with a malpositioned permanent hemodialysis catheter, 
catheter tip was found in hepatic vein after three months of insertion.

AP-2 complex is widely distributed in eukaryotes in the form of heterotetramer 
that functions in the uptake of membrane proteins during mammalian/plant 
clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, its biological function remains 
mysterious in pathogenic fungi. In this study, the wheat scab fungus, Fusarium 
graminearum, was used to characterise the biological function of the AP-2 
complex. Our study shows that FgAP-2 complex plays a critical role in the 
maintenance of hyphal polarity. Lack of any subunit (FgAP2α , FgAP2β , FgAP2σ , 
and FgAP2mu ) of the FgAP-2 complex significantly affects the fungal vegetative 
growth, conidial morphology, and germination. Remarkably, FgAP-2 complex is 
important for the fungal pathogenicity, especially during colonisation and 
extension after infecting the host. The FgAP-2 complex is expressed ubiquitously 
at all developmental stages but having more concentrated protein distribution at 
the subapical collar and septa in young growing hyphae. Although FgAP-2 complex 
displays similar dynamic behaviour to the actin patch components and accumulates 
at endocytic sites, it is dispensable for general endocytosis. We further 
demonstrated that FgAP-2 complex is required for polar localisation of the lipid 
flippases FgDnfA and FgDnfB, which led to the proposal that FgAP-2 functions as 
a cargo-specific adaptor that promotes polar growth and colonising ability of 
F. graminearum.

Extended Half-Life Coagulation Factors: A New Era in the Management of 
Hemophilia Patients.

Despite effective factor replacement and various treatment schedules, there 
remain several challenges and unmet needs in the prophylactic treatment of 
hemophilia limiting its adoption and thereby posing an increased risk of 
spontaneous bleeding. In this regard, extended half-life (EHL) recombinant 
factor VIII (rFVIII) and factor IX (rFIX) products promise optimal prophylaxis 
by decreasing the dose frequency, increasing the compliance, and improving the 
quality of life without compromising safety and efficacy. EHL products might 
lead to higher trough levels without increasing infusion frequency, or could 
facilitate the ability to maintain trough levels while reducing infusion 
frequency. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the rationale 
for developing EHL coagulation factors and their utility in the management of 
hemophilia, with special emphasis on optimal techniques for half-life extension 
and criteria for defining EHL coagulation factors, as well as indications, 
efficacy, and safety issues of the currently available EHL-rFVIII and EHL-rFIX 
products. Potential impacts of these factors on quality of life, health 
economics, and immune tolerance treatment will also be discussed alongside the 
challenges in pharmacokinetic-driven prophylaxis and difficulties in monitoring 
the EHL products with laboratory assays.

The extended life expectancy and the raise of accidental trauma call for an 
increase of osteoarticular surgical procedures. Arthroplasty, the main clinical 
option to treat osteoarticular lesions, has limitations and drawbacks. In this 
manuscript, we test the preclinical safety of the innovative implant ARTiCAR for 
the treatment of osteoarticular lesions. Thanks to the combination of two 
advanced therapy medicinal products, a polymeric nanofibrous bone wound dressing 
and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, the ARTiCAR promotes both 
subchondral bone and cartilage regeneration. In this work, the ARTiCAR shows 1) 
the feasibility in treating osteochondral defects in a large animal model, 2) 
the possibility to monitor non-invasively the healing process and 3) the overall 
safety in two animal models under GLP preclinical standards. Our data indicate 
the preclinical safety of ARTiCAR according to the international regulatory 
guidelines; the ARTiCAR could therefore undergo phase I clinical trial.

We collected 60 age-dependent transcriptomes for C. elegans strains including 
four exceptionally long-lived mutants (mean adult lifespan extended 2.2- to 
9.4-fold) and three examples of lifespan-increasing RNAi treatments. Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) reveals aging as a transcriptomic drift along a single 
direction, consistent across the vastly diverse biological conditions and 
coinciding with the first principal component, a hallmark of the criticality of 
the underlying gene regulatory network. We therefore expected that the 
organism's aging state could be characterized by a single number closely related 
to vitality deficit or biological age. The "aging trajectory", i.e. the 
dependence of the biological age on chronological age, is then a universal 
stochastic function modulated by the network stiffness; a macroscopic parameter 
reflecting the network topology and associated with the rate of aging. To 
corroborate this view, we used publicly available datasets to define a 
transcriptomic biomarker of age and observed that the rescaling of age by 
lifespan simultaneously brings together aging trajectories of transcription and 
survival curves. In accordance with the theoretical prediction, the limiting 
mortality value at the plateau agrees closely with the mortality rate doubling 
exponent estimated at the cross-over age near the average lifespan. Finally, we 
used the transcriptomic signature of age to identify possible life-extending 
drug compounds and successfully tested a handful of the top-ranking molecules in 
C. elegans survival assays and achieved up to a +30% extension of mean lifespan.

This study evaluates the physical and psychosocial effects of an inpatient 
exercise program for children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT). Participants (n = 70) were randomized to an exercise 
intervention (IG: resistance, endurance, and flexibility training) or a 
non-exercise control group (CG: mental and relaxation training). Pre- (prior 
hospital admission; T0) and post- (day of discharge; T1) measurements included 
maximal isometric knee extension strength (KES; strain gauge force transducer), 
hand grip strength (HGS; JAMAR dynamometer), distance walked in 6 min (6MWD; 
6-minute walk test), quality of life (QoL; KINDL-R) and medical parameters. 
Fifty-seven patients (IG: n = 28; 11.0 (5-17) years; CG: n = 29; 12.0 (6-18) 
years) completed the study. During hospitalization the IG and CG attended on 
average 3.1 (2-4) or 2.9 (0.3-4) training sessions weekly. KES, 6MWD, and HGS 
significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the CG, while there were no changes in the 
IG. Pre- to post-changes in 6MWD and HGS differed significantly between groups 
(p < 0.05). QoL declined in both groups (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that a 
moderate exercise program is feasible and might counteract a 
treatment-associated decline of physical performance.

INTRODUCTION: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is widely used to treat 
atrial fibrillation (AF) in China.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the long-term cost effectiveness of RFCA versus 
antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in treating AF from the perspective of third-party 
payers.
METHODS: The model was structured as a 12-month decision tree leading to a 
Markov model that simulated the follow-up treatment outcomes and costs with time 
horizons of 8, 15, and 20 years. Comparators were standard-of-care AADs. 
Clinical parameters captured normal sinus rhythm, AF, stroke, post-stroke, 
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), gastrointestinal bleeding, post-ICH, and death. 
The risk of operative death, procedural complications, and adverse drug toxicity 
were also considered. The model output was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and incremental cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: RFCA incurred more costs than the AADs but resulted in more QALYs 
gained than did AADs. The incremental cost per QALY gained with RFCA versus AADs 
was ¥66,764, ¥36,280, and ¥29,359 at 8, 15, and 20 years, respectively. The 
sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to the changes 
in RFCA cost and CHADS2 score (clinical prediction rule for assessing the risk 
of stroke in patients with non-rheumatic AF).
CONCLUSION: Compared with AADs, RFCA significantly improves clinical outcomes 
and QALYs among patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. From the Chinese 
payer's perspective, RFCA is a cost-effective therapy over long-term horizons.

Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio av. 7, 10257, 
Vilnius, Lithuania.

A set of five N4 -acyl-modified 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphates were 
incorporated into modified DNA by using phi29 DNA polymerase, and cleavage by 
selected restriction endonucleases was studied. Modified DNA containing N4 -acyl 
functional groups in either one or both strands of a DNA molecule was resistant 
to the majority of restriction enzymes tested, whereas modifications outside of 
the recognition sequences were well tolerated. The N4 -acylated cytidine 
derivatives were subjected to competitive nucleotide incorporation by using 
phi29 DNA polymerase, showing that a high-fidelity phi29 DNA polymerase 
efficiently used the modified analogues in the presence of its natural 
counterpart. These N4 modifications were also demonstrated to be easily removed 
in an aqueous ethanolamine solution, in which all steps, including primer 
extension, demodification, and cleavage by restriction endonuclease, could be 
performed in a one-pot procedure that eliminated additional purification stages. 
It is suggested that N4 -modified nucleotides are promising building blocks for 
a programmable; transient; and, most importantly, straightforward DNA protection 
against specific endonucleases.

Switzerland.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lung transplantation has become an accepted therapy in 
infants, children, and adolescents suffering from end-stage lung diseases, an 
impaired quality of life and reduced life expectancy. The aim of this review is 
to highlight specific aspects of pediatric lung transplantation and to give an 
update on recent findings.
RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, over 100 lung transplant procedures are performed in 
children annually worldwide. Long-term success is limited by availability of 
donor organs and waitlist mortality pretransplant, and an increased infection 
risk because of immunosuppression, and most importantly late complications, such 
as chronic lung allograft dysfunction, medication nonadherence, and transition 
intricacies.
SUMMARY: Specific aspects of pediatric lung transplantation will be reviewed and 
an update on most recent developments in the management of pediatric lung 
transplant recipients given.

of the Canadian 2012 General Social Survey.

INTRODUCTION: Increases in life expectancy and the underlying age structure of 
the Canadian population have contributed to dramatic increases in the number of 
seniors who are caregivers. While caregiving is associated with several adverse 
health impacts, there is a need to better understand how these impacts might be 
different among older caregivers, and whether those impacts are modified by 
socioeconomic status.
METHODS: We sought to address these research gaps by using cross-sectional data 
provided by participants of the 2012 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS). 
Descriptive analyses were performed to compare the self-reported health impacts 
that participants attributed to caregiving, and how these varied by age and 
income. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify which factors 
were associated with self-reported impacts on overall health among caregivers 65 
years of age and older.
RESULTS: The demographic characteristics of the care-providers varied 
substantially by age with older caregivers having lower incomes and devoting 
more time to caregiving relative to those who were younger. The self-reported 
impacts of caregiving on overall health were greatest among those between the 
ages of 35 and 64, and this pattern was evident across all income groups. 
Feelings of loneliness and social isolation as a result of caregiving 
responsibilities appeared to be mitigated by both greater age and income. 
However, across all age groups, caregiving was more likely to adversely impact 
exercise habits, healthy eating, and alcohol consumption than to promote more 
positive behaviours.
CONCLUSION: Providing care impacts health behaviours and mental health 
regardless of age and income. However, our findings suggest that older 
caregivers (who are most often women)-who provide the most hours of care and on 
reduced incomes relative to younger caregivers-appear less impacted in terms of 
health behaviours, perhaps as a result of fewer competing demands relative to 
younger caregivers. Taken together, these findings suggest that support systems 
must consider caregiver impacts that vary in complex ways across age, sex, and 
income.

Publisher: INTRODUCTION: L’augmentation de l’espérance de vie et la structure 
par âge sous-jacente de la population canadienne ont contribué à une 
augmentation spectaculaire du nombre d’aînés aidants naturels. Sachant que la 
prestation de soins est associée à divers effets néfastes sur la santé, il est 
nécessaire de mieux comprendre en quoi ces effets peuvent être différents chez 
les aidants plus âgés et si ces effets sont modifiés par le statut 
socioéconomique.
MÉTHODOLOGIE: Nous avons cherché à combler ces lacunes en matière de recherche 
en utilisant des données transversales fournies par les participants à l’Enquête 
sociale générale (ESG) canadienne de 2012. Des analyses descriptives ont été 
effectuées pour comparer les répercussions sur la santé que les participants ont 
attribuées à la prestation de soins et étudier la façon dont elles varient selon 
l’âge et le revenu. Des analyses de régression logistique ont été réalisées afin 
de déterminer les facteurs associés aux effets sur la santé globale déclarés par 
les aidants de 65 ans et plus.
RÉSULTATS: Les caractéristiques individuelles des fournisseurs de soins 
variaient considérablement en fonction de l’âge, les aidants plus âgés ayant des 
revenus plus faibles et consacrant plus de temps à la prestation de soins que 
les aidants plus jeunes. Les réper-cussions autodéclarées de la prestation de 
soins sur l’état de santé global étaient plus importantes chez les répondants de 
35 à 64 ans, et ce, dans toutes les catégories de revenu. Les sentiments de 
solitude et d'isolement social découlant des responsabilités d'aidant semblaient 
être atténués dans les groupes d’âge et de revenu plus élevés. Dans tous les 
groupes d’âge, la prestation de soins était plus susceptible d'avoir des effets 
néfastes sur les habitudes en matière d’exercice, d’alimentation saine et de 
consommation d’alcool que de promouvoir des comportements plus positifs.
CONCLUSION: La prestation de soins a des répercussions sur les comportements 
liés à la santé et sur la santé mentale, quels que soient l’âge et le revenu. 
D’après nos résultats, les aidants plus âgés (le plus souvent des femmes), qui 
fournissent le plus grand nombre d’heures de soins et dont le revenu est 
inférieur à celui des aidants plus jeunes, semblent cependant moins touchés sur 
le plan des comportements liés à la santé. Cela s’explique peut-être par 
l’existence d’un moins grand nombre de besoins concomitants chez eux que chez 
les aidants plus jeunes. Ces résultats laissent entendre que les systèmes de 
soutien aux aidants doivent tenir compte de répercussions variables de façon 
complexe en fonction de l’âge, du sexe et du revenu.

Plain Language Summary: This study was aimed at investigating the social and 
health impacts of caregiving among senior care providers, and how these impacts 
differed from younger caregivers. The 2012 Canadian General Social Survey was 
used to analyse self-reported health impacts that participants attributed to 
caregiving. Consistent with previous studies, providing care was found to have 
detrimental effects on health behaviours related to exercise, diet, and alcohol 
consumption. Among caregivers aged 65 and older, women, compared to men, and 
those who devoted a greater number of hours to care-giving were more likely to 
report detrimental impacts on overall health. The impacts of caregiving occurred 
across all income categories. However, although older caregivers were more 
likely to be in the lowest income group, they reported the least financial 
hardship due to caregiving.

Plain Language Summary: Cette étude visait à examiner les répercussions, sur le 
plan social et sur le plan de la santé, de la prestation de soins des 
fournisseurs de soins âgés et à analyser en quoi ces répercussions pouvaient 
différer de celles des fournisseurs de soins plus jeunes. L’Enquête sociale 
générale canadienne de 2012 a servi à analyser les répercussions sur leur santé 
que les participants ont attribuées à la pres-tation de soins. Nous avons 
constaté, ce qui rejoint les conclusions d’autres études, que la prestation de 
soins a des effets néfastes sur les comportements liés à la santé en matière 
d’exercice, d’alimentation et de consommation d’alcool. Parmi les aidants de 65 
ans et plus, les femmes, comparativement aux hommes, et ceux qui consacraient un 
plus grand nombre d’heures à la prestation de soins étaient plus susceptibles de 
signaler des effets néfastes sur leur santé globale. Les répercussions de la 
prestation de soins sont visibles au sein de toutes les catégories de revenu. 
Toutefois, et bien que les aidants plus âgés soient plus susceptibles 
d’appartenir au groupe de revenu le plus faible, ce sont eux qui ont déclaré le 
moins de difficultés financières découlant de la prestation de soins.

Masquerade syndromes represent a large set of ophthalmological entities that 
mimic inflammatory conditions. Any delay in their diagnosis may be correlated 
with systemic dissemination or worsening of the causal disease and, therefore, 
with poor prognosis. One of the disadvantages of the new potent treatments of 
uveitis is the delay that they can induce in the diagnosis of neoplastic 
intraocular infiltrations. Thorough and careful clinical examination of all 
patients referred for uveitis, especially when they are Caucasian, over 50 years 
of age, and with posterior segment involvement, is of paramount importance in 
this context. Ancillary investigations and often-invasive histo-pathologic 
evaluation of tissue specimens or ocular fluids are regularly required in these 
situations. The most common masquerade syndrome is primary vitreoretinal 
lymphoma (PVRL). New molecular diagnostic tools may be helpful in challenging 
cases lacking cytological confirmation. Therapeutic strategies targeting tumoral 
cells in the eye and also in the central nervous system can improve the life 
expectancy of affected patients. In this review, we discuss diagnostic 
strategies and current therapies in PVRL and provide an overview of other 
conditions that can mimic primary ocular inflammation, especially in the field 
of oncology and its new therapeutic armamentarium.

Strategy and tactics of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

[Article in English]

Kvapil M.

The results of randomized double-blind studies provide scientifically accurate 
data on the efficacy of antidiabetic drugs. With the widening understanding of 
heterogeneity of the group of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the 
broadening possibilities of interventions available, a differentiated approach 
to therapy is now accentuated. From the perspective of pathophysiology, 
8-10 different disorders have been described which contribute to the occurrence 
of hyperglycemia, but they cannot be quantified in common practice. However, it 
is possible to evaluate the amount of insulin secretion (C-peptide), the 
presence or severity of insulin resistance (triacylglycerols), glomerular 
filtration and, of course, patient compliance. The strategic goal of treatment 
of diabetes mellitus is to reduce the risk of late complications, both specific 
and non-specific (atherosclerotic), and if they arise, then slowing-down of 
their progression. All of this as a means of reducing mortality and improving 
quality of life. The tactics of therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus must first 
of all be chosen individually. We bear in mind the general circumstances (life 
expectancy, comorbidities, age, compliance, social background, type of work) and 
specific characteristics of the current development of diabetes (the dominant 
nature of metabolic disorder, the level of preservation of insulin secretion or 
response to prandial stimulation, presence and progression of complications). 
A timely combination of 2 or more antidiabetic drugs targeting individual 
pathophysiological mechanisms can be considered useful.

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate health state utility values in eight 
health states related to osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures using time 
trade-off (TTO) technique among postmenopausal Korean women.Methods: Scenarios 
describing eight health states including osteoporosis and hip, vertebral, 
post-hip, post-vertebral, ankle, humerus, and wrist fractures were developed and 
presented to 500 female participants aged 45 to 59 years who were selected with 
probability proportionate to age group and region for this investigation. Each 
health states valuation was derived using the trade-off (TTO) technique. Ten 
years of a given health state was traded off with a shorter length of time in 
full health.Results: Mean scores of each state were calculated. Osteoporosis 
scored the highest (0.669 ± 0.155), followed by wrist fracture (0.656 ± 0.151). 
Hip (0.298 ± 0.158) and vertebral (0.298 ± 0.160) fractures were found to be the 
worst health states. Post-hip (0.446 ± 0.159) and post-vertebral fractures 
(0.455 ± 0.160) were also considered undesirable states. All fractures were 
associated with disutilities, ranging from a mean of -0.013 to -0.371. These 
values were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Hip and vertebral fractures 
are among the most serious consequences of osteoporotic fractures.Conclusions: 
The vertebral and hip fractures marked the lowest utility scores among 
post-menopausal women in Korea.
