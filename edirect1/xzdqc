nanocluster (BSA-CuNC) customized ibuprofen nanodrug (BSA-CuNC-Ibf), 
encapsulating the ibuprofen was developed. Ibuprofen, which is commonly used to 
treat inflammation, was utilized here as a model drug. The formation of BSA-CuNC 
initiated by encapsulation of the Cu ions within the protein moiety followed by 
gradual reduction of the Cu ions by certain amino acid residues like tyrosine 
and tryptophan at alkaline pH resulted in the formation of BSA-CuNC within the 
protein template. Heat treatment and lowering the pH fitted the ibuprofen in the 
center by hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and 
resulted in the formation of nanoparticles. The nanodrug (BSA-CuNC-Ibf) thus 
formed was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic and 
static light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential. The spherical shaped nanodrug 
has a hydrodynamic diameter of about 100.4 ± 28.9 nm. The encapsulation 
efficiency was found to be 94% which corresponds to 1880 μg/mL of ibuprofen in 
the BSA-CuNC-Ibf nanodrug. The as synthesized BSA-CuNC-Ibf exhibited 
cytotoxicity on both human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and human lung cancer 
cells (A549). The present nanodrug when explored for its tumor preventive role 
on Daltons lymphoma ascites (DLA) bearing Swiss albino mice, exemplified sizable 
inhibition of tumor growth by reactive oxygen species mediated apoptosis and by 
modulating prostaglandin (PGE2) levels. It also inhibited metastasis of the 
cancer cells, thus enhancing the life expectancy of the mice.

Wound dressing has been used for decades to be effective for accelerating skin 
wound healing. However, practical applications are still limited due to their 
lower cell affinity, tissue adhesiveness, and biocompatibility. Natural polymers 
are the important biomaterials because of their excellent biodegradability, 
biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity. In this work, the composite 
bioadhesives (PLS-CS/RSF) were prepared from regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) and 
polylysine-modified chitosan (PLS-CS) that were cross-linked by Ca2+ ions. The 
adhesion property tests showed that the PLS-CS/RSF exhibited excellent bonding 
potentials for various substrates, and the adhesive strength was up to 70 kPa 
for isolated porcine skin by the extension test. The as-prepared PLS-CS/RSF was 
nontoxic, displayed obvious antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus 
and Escherichia coli in vitro, and their bacteriostasis rates were 100% after 
120 min treatment. In addition, the PLS-CS/RSF exhibited favorable 
cytocompatibility by cell counting kit-8 assay. The animal model of wound 
closure results showed that PLS-CS/RSF can promote wound closure and the 
integrity of wound healing, inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factor and 
tumor necrosis factor and stimulating vascular factor and α-smooth muscle actin 
to the release of vascular growth factor and promote angiogenesis during the 
process of wound healing by immunohistochemical assay.

All viruses must usurp host ribosomes for viral protein synthesis. 
Dicistroviruses utilize an intergenic region internal ribosome entry site (IGR 
IRES) to directly recruit ribosomes and mediate translation initiation from a 
non-AUG start codon. The IGR IRES adopts a three-pseudoknot structure that 
comprises a ribosome binding domain of pseudoknot II and III (PKII and PKIII), 
and a tRNA-like anticodon domain (PKI) connected via a short, one to three 
nucleotide hinge region. Recent cryo-EM structural analysis of the dicistrovirus 
Taura syndrome virus (TSV) IGR IRES bound to the ribosome suggests that the 
hinge region may facilitate translocation of the IRES from the ribosomal A to P 
site. In this study, we provide mechanistic and functional insights into the 
role of the hinge region in IGR IRES translation. Using the honeybee 
dicistrovirus, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), as a model, we demonstrate 
that mutations of the hinge region resulted in decreased IRES-dependent 
translation in vitro. Toeprinting primer extension analysis of mutant IRESs 
bound to purified ribosomes and in rabbit reticulocyte lysates showed defects in 
the initial ribosome positioning on the IRES. Finally, using a hybrid 
dicistrovirus clone, mutations in the hinge region of the IAPV IRES resulted in 
decreased viral yield. Our work reveals an unexpected role of the hinge region 
of the dicistrovirus IGR IRES coordinating the two independently folded domains 
of the IRES to properly position the ribosome to start translation. IMPORTANCE 
Viruses must use the host cell machinery to direct viral protein expression for 
productive infection. One such mechanism is an internal ribosome entry site that 
can directly recruit host cell machinery. In this study, we have identified a 
novel sequence in an IRES that provides insight into the mechanism of viral gene 
expression. Specifically, this novel sequence promotes viral IRES activity by 
directly guiding the host cell machinery to start gene expression at a specific 
site.

We aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal trends in the global burden of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) attributable to both household air 
pollution from solid fuels (HAP) and ambient particulate matter (APM) from 1990 
to 2019 and compared the possible differences between the burdens attributable 
to APM and HAP. The number of deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), 
and years of life lost (YLLs) of COPD attributable to HAP from solid fuels and 
APM during 1990-2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 
2019. The proportion of YLLs in DALYs and average YLLs per COPD death were also 
calculated. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, and socio-demographic index (SDI) 
were conducted. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was used to assess 
the temporal trend of age-standardized rate of mortality (ASMR) and DALYs 
(ASDR). Over the past 30 years, we observed a clear downward trend in COPD 
deaths attributable to HAP and an upward trend by 97.61% in COPD deaths 
attributable to APM. The global COPD burden attributable to APM in 2019 was 
higher than those due to HAP, except in low-SDI regions. For both HAP and APM, 
YLLs continued to predominate in DALYs of COPD, with an average YLLs per death 
of more than 10 years in different regions. The ASMR was higher in males and 
lower in high-SDI regions. The ASMR and ASDR attributable to HAP decreased 
globally in all age groups during 1990-2019, while those attributable to APM 
increased among people older than 80 years and in regions with lower SDI. Our 
study reveals an increasing trend in APM-attributable COPD burden over the past 
three decades. Comparatively, the global burden due to HAP decreased markedly, 
but it was still pronounced in low-SDI regions. Continued efforts on PM 
mitigation are needed for COPD prevention.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endoxifen is the active metabolite of tamoxifen, and 
a minimal plasma concentration of 16 nM has been suggested as a threshold above 
which it is effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence. The aim 
of the current analysis was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of therapeutic 
drug monitoring (TDM)-guided tamoxifen dosing.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a Dutch healthcare 
perspective, using a partitioned survival model and a lifetime horizon. The 
reduction in subtherapeutic treatment following TDM is modelled as improved 
rates of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in comparison 
to standard tamoxifen treatment. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and 
a series of scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the 
results.
RESULTS: Base-case results estimated a total increase in life years and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for TDM of 0.40 and 0.53, respectively. 
Total costs for TDM and standard tamoxifen treatment are €32,893 and €39,524, 
respectively. The TDM intervention results in both more QALYs and less 
healthcare costs, indicating a dominating effect for TDM. The PSA results 
indicate that the probability of TDM being cost-effective is 92% when using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000.
CONCLUSIONS: TDM-guided dose optimization of tamoxifen is estimated to save 
costs and increase QALYs for early breast cancer patients.

Robust angiogenesis is continuously active in ovaries to remodel the ovary-body 
connections in mammals, but understanding of this unique process remains 
elusive. Here, we performed high-resolution, three-dimensional ovarian vascular 
imaging and traced the pattern of ovarian angiogenesis and vascular development 
in the long term. We found that angiogenesis was mainly active on ovarian 
follicles and corpus luteum and that robust angiogenesis constructs independent 
but temporary vascular networks for each follicle. Based on the pattern of 
ovarian angiogenesis, we designed an angiogenesis-blocking strategy by axitinib 
administration to young females, and we found that the temporary suppression of 
angiogenesis paused ovarian development and kept the ovarian reserve in the long 
term, leading to postponed ovarian senescence and an extension of the female 
reproductive life span. Together, by uncovering the detailed model of 
physiological ovarian angiogenesis, our experiments suggest a potential approach 
to delay female reproductive aging through the manipulation of angiogenesis.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease in North America. 
While CF is more common among Whites, it is increasingly being recognized in 
other races and ethnicities. Although there is no cure, life expectancy has 
steadily improved, with the median survival exceeding 46 years in the United 
States. There are now more adults than children with CF in the United States. CF 
is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, expressed in many epithelial cells. More 
than 2100 CFTR mutations have been linked to CF, and newer CFTR modulator drugs 
are being used to improve the production, intracellular processing, and function 
of the defective CFTR protein. CF is a multisystem disease that affects 
primarily the lungs, pancreas, hepatobiliary system, and reproductive organs. 
Anesthesiologists routinely encounter CF patients for various surgical and 
medical procedures, depending on the age group. This review article focuses on 
the changing epidemiology of CF, advances in the classification of CFTR 
mutations, the latest innovations in CFTR modulator therapies, the impact of the 
coronavirus disease pandemic, and perioperative considerations that 
anesthesiologists must know while caring for patients with CF.

Although combinational anticancer chemotherapies have been proven to improve the 
life expectancy of patients in the clinic, their full potential is severely 
limited by the additive toxicities of the drug molecules. Targeted drug delivery 
systems could alleviate this major limitation by the design of nanocarriers that 
can cocarry multiple drug molecules in order to augment drug synergism at the 
site of interest while reducing the systemic side effects. In this study, we 
report on a thermoresponsive polymer-coated liposome nanocarrier that is capable 
to cocarry two potent anticancer drugs and release them via a thermally 
triggered mechanism. A synthetic polymer ([poly(diethylene glycol) 
methacrylate-co-poly(oligoethylene glycol) methacrylate]-b-poly(2-ethylhexyl) 
methacrylate) was synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain 
transfer (RAFT) polymerization and was used as a thermoresponsive polymer 
coating shell on thermosensitive liposome carriers. The formulations were tested 
in vitro against two pancreatic cancer cell lines, MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3, and 
their cytotoxic potency was studied with respect to their targeted release 
properties as well as their biological interactions with cellular organelles. 
The polymer-modified liposomes (PMTLs) could cocarry and release Gemcitabine 
(Gem) and cisplatin (Cis) in a thermally controlled rate and were also found to 
exhibit specific hydrophobic interactions with the cell membranes above the 
temperature transition of the formulations. In addition, the nanocarriers were 
found to induce more than 10-fold improvement of the IC50 of both drugs, either 
as monotherapies or in combination, in both cell lines tested, in a temperature 
dependent manner. The proposed formulations constitute a potent nanomedicinal 
approach for the codelivery of multiple drug molecules and could find potential 
uses as thermally triggered drug delivery systems for precision medicine and 
oncology and also as modulators of drug efficacy at the cellular level owing to 
their unique interactions with the cell membranes.

Is high age a contraindication to pulmonary resection?

[Article in English]

Horák P, Kengbaeva M, Doležal J, Harciníková N, Fanta J, Vobořil R.

INTRODUCTION: As the population ages, there are increasing numbers of elderly 
patients diagnosed with operable primary pulmonary malignancy or other lesions 
requiring pulmonary resection. The objective of the study was to evaluate 
post-operative outcomes in the elderly group and compare them with younger 
patients undergoing the same surgery.
METHODS: Retrospectively, we evaluated our own set of 424 patients undergoing 
anatomical pulmonary resection for primary lung cancers and other resectable 
lesions in 20112020. 328 patients underwent open procedures, and VATS lobectomy 
was performed 96 times. We evaluated the set of patients in terms of 30-day 
morbidity and mortality using Clavien-Dindo classification modified for 
pulmonary resections. We compared the patient subgroups by age (under 55, 5564 
years old, 6574 years and over 75 years).
RESULTS: A non-biometric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the groups. We 
have not shown a statistically significant difference in the number of 
complications (p=0.220).
CONCLUSION: Standard surgical treatment for non-small cell lung carcinoma, 
lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy, is safe also for a 
well-indicated group of seniors. With careful preoperative assessments and 
consideration of the extent of resection, we can expect a comparable rate of 
complications in the elderly compared to younger patients. Sublobar resection or 
radiotherapy should be considered in case of patients at risk. For seniors over 
70 years of age, comparable outcomes of oncological treatment can be reached, 
taking into account their shorter life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: NHS hospitals do not have clearly defined geographic populations to 
whom they provide care, with patients able to attend any hospital. Identifying a 
core population for a hospital trust, particularly those in urban areas where 
there are multiple providers and high population churn, is essential to 
understanding local key health needs especially given the move to integrated 
care systems. This can enable effective planning and delivery of preventive 
interventions and community engagement, rather than simply treating those 
presenting to services. In this article we describe a practical method for 
identifying a hospital's catchment population based on where potential patients 
are most likely to reside, and describe that population's size, demographic and 
social profile, and the key health needs.
METHODS: A 30% proportional flow method was used to identify a catchment 
population using an acute hospital trust in West London as an example. Records 
of all hospital attendances between 1st April 2017 and 31st March 2018 were 
analysed using Hospital Episode Statistics. Any Lower Layer Super Output Areas 
where 30% or more of residents who attended any hospital for care did so at the 
example trust were assigned to the catchment area. Publicly available local and 
national datasets were then applied to identify and describe the population's 
key health needs.
RESULTS: A catchment comprising 617,709 people, of an equal gender-split (50.4% 
male) and predominantly working age (15 to 64 years) population was identified. 
Thirty nine point six percent of residents identified as being from Black and 
Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups, a similar proportion that reported being born 
abroad, with over 85 languages spoken. Health indicators were estimated, 
including: a healthy life expectancy difference of over twenty years; bowel 
cancer screening coverage of 48.8%; chlamydia diagnosis rates of 2,136 per 
100,000; prevalence of visible dental decay among five-year-olds of 27.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: We define a blueprint by which a catchment can be defined for a 
hospital trust and demonstrate the value a hospital-view of the local population 
could provide in understanding local health needs and enabling population-level 
health improvement interventions. While an individual approach allows tailoring 
to local context and need, there could be an efficiency saving were such public 
health information made routinely and regularly available for every NHS 
hospital.

University of California San Francisco.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Aducanumab was granted accelerated approval with a 
conflicting evidence base, near-unanimous Food and Drug Administration Advisory 
Committee vote to reject approval, and a widely criticized launch price of 
$56,000 per year. The objective of this analysis was to estimate its 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare aducanumab in addition to 
supportive care to supportive care alone over a lifetime horizon. Results were 
presented from both the health system and modified societal perspective. The 
model tracked the severity of disease and the care setting. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated and a threshold analysis was conducted 
to estimate at what price aducanumab would meet commonly used cost-effectiveness 
thresholds.
RESULTS: Using estimates of effectiveness based on pooling of data from both 
pivotal trials, patients treated with aducanumab spent 4 more months in earlier 
stages of Alzheimer disease. Over the lifetime time horizon, treating a patient 
with aducanumab results in 0.154 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained 
per patient and 0.201 equal value of life-years gained (evLYG) per patient from 
the health care system perspective, with additional costs of approximately 
$204,000 per patient. The incremental outcomes were similar for the modified 
societal perspective. At the launch price of $56,000 per year, the 
cost-effectiveness ranged from $1.02 million per evLYG to $1.33 million per QALY 
gained from the health care system perspective and from $938,000 per evLYG to 
$1.27 million per QALY gained in the modified societal perspective. The annual 
price to meet commonly used cost-effectiveness thresholds ranged from $2,950 to 
$8,360, which represents a discount of 85%-95% off from the annual launch price 
set by the manufacturer. Using estimates of effectiveness based only on the 
trial that suggested a benefit, the mean incremental cost was greater than 
$400,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Patients treated with aducanumab received minimal improvements in 
health outcomes at considerable cost. This resulted in incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios that far exceeded commonly used value thresholds, even 
under optimistic treatment effectiveness assumptions. These findings are subject 
to the substantial uncertainty regarding whether aducanumab provides any true 
net health benefit, but evidence available currently suggests that an annual 
price of aducanumab of $56,000 is not in reasonable alignment with its clinical 
benefits.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) treatment levies substantial financial burden on 
health services. Potentially curative surgery with or without chemotherapy is 
offered to patients with locoregional disease. This study aimed to examine 
treatment costs related to life-years gained in patients having potentially 
curative treatment (gastrectomy) and those receiving best supportive care (BSC).
METHODS: Some 398 consecutive patients with GC were classified according to 
treatment modality (116 BSC, 282 gastrectomy). Cost calculations for 1 year's 
treatment from referral were made according to network diagnostic, staging and 
treatment algorithms. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: GC median survival after BSC was 8 months, costing €5413, compared with 
gastrectomy median survival of 34 months, costing €22 753 for 1 year's 
treatment: cost per life-year gained €9319. Cost incurred for stage I GC was €22 
434, stage II €23 498, stage III €22 445, and stage IV €22 032. Based on these 
values, the cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) for BSC for stage I GC 
was -€8335 stage II -€8952, stage III -€11 317, and stage IV -€25 669.
CONCLUSION: Potentially curative treatment that included gastrectomy improved OS 
four-fold compared with BSC and was cost-effective at national thresholds of 
readiness to pay per QALY.

BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) have evolved as a 
first-line therapy for delaying end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in Alport 
syndrome (AS). The present study tested the hypothesis of a superior 
nephroprotective potential of an early ACEi intervention, examining a cohort 
with the COL4A5 missense variant p.(Gly624Asp).
METHODS: In this observational cohort study (NCT02378805), 114 individuals with 
the identical gene variant were explored for age at ESRF and life expectancy in 
correlation with treatment as endpoints.
RESULTS: All 13 untreated hemizygous patients developed ESRF (mean age 48.9 ± 
13.7 years), as did 3 very late treated hemizygotes (51.7 ± 4.2 years), with a 
mean life expectancy of 59.2 ± 9.6 years. All 28 earlier-treated [estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2] hemizygous patients were 
still alive and still had not reached ESRF. Therapy minimized the annual loss of 
their GFR, similar to the annual loss in healthy individuals. Of 65 
heterozygotes, 4 untreated individuals developed ESRF at an age of 53.3 ± 20.7 
years. None of the treated heterozygous females developed ESRF.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study shows that in AS, early therapy in 
individuals with missense variants might have the potential to delay renal 
failure for their lifetime and thus to improve life expectancy and quality of 
life without the need for renal replacement therapy. Some treated patients have 
reached their retirement age with still-functioning kidneys, whereas their 
untreated relatives have reached ESRF at the same or a younger age. Thus, in 
children with glomerular haematuria, early testing for Alport-related gene 
variants could lead to timely nephroprotective intervention.

PURPOSE: To report the effects of pegvisomant (PEGV) treatment on 
patient-reported outcomes in acromegaly patients.
METHODS: We conducted an extension study of an open-label, multinational, 
non-interventional study (ACROSTUDY) evaluating the long-term safety and 
efficacy of PEGV for acromegaly in routine clinical practice. Enrolled patients 
were rollover patients from ACROSTUDY, or treatment naïve/semi-naïve (NSN; no 
PEGV within 6 months of enrollment). Exploratory efficacy endpoints were changes 
in symptoms with the Patient-Assessed Acromegaly Symptom Questionnaire (PASQ) 
and quality of life with the Acromegaly Quality of Life questionnaire (AcroQoL) 
analyzed by controlled or uncontrolled IGF-I levels. Results were analyzed in 
all patients, in NSN patient subgroup, and by diabetes status.
RESULTS: A total of 544 patients with acromegaly were enrolled, including 434 
rollover subjects from ACROSTUDY and 110 NSN patients. Mean PEGV treatment 
duration was 7.8 years (range, 0-19.6 years). Overall, the majority of PASQ 
scores improved over time, but there was no significant difference between IGF-I 
controlled or uncontrolled groups. In the NSN subgroup, most PASQ and AcroQoL 
scores remained similar to baseline up to 1 year, regardless of IGF-I control. 
Patients with diabetes reported better PASQ scores over time with PEGV 
treatment, regardless of IGF-I control. IGF-I normalization increased from 10% 
of patients at baseline to more than 78% at year 10, with a mean daily PEGV dose 
of 18.7 mg.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients treated with PEGV had small improvements in PASQ. 
While IGF-I normalization increased with PEGV treatment, IGF-I control had no 
effects on PASQ and AcroQoL scores.

Thalassemia major (TM) is a hereditary disease caused by defective globin 
synthesis. Because of the significant increase in life expectancy, these 
patients are suffering from various health conditions, including 
endocrinopathies and low bone mineral density. The aim of the present study was 
to investigate the correlation between clinical and biochemical parameters as 
well as to identify possible relations in a genotype to phenotype pattern. 
Sixty-four patients with TM (32 men and 32 women) participated in a 
cross-sectional study design. The patients were recruited from "Aghia Sofia" 
Children's Hospital. Clinical and biochemical parameters were evaluated as well 
as specific mutations were identified. We have found significant correlations 
between biochemical parameters and iron chelation, hormone replacement treatment 
as well as TM genotype and hematocrit and T-score. To conclude, the current 
study showed that clinical parameters of TM patients correlate significantly 
with both biochemical factors and genotypical patient parameters. Our present 
study showed that there is a connection between genotype and phenotype as, for 
example, the identified relation between hematocrit and T-scores and TM-specific 
mutations. This connection indicates that there is still much more to learn 
about the role of mutations not only in the disease itself but also in the 
underlying comorbidities.

Tissue engineering is a promising and revolutionary strategy to treat patients 
who suffer the loss or failure of an organ or tissue, with the aim to restore 
the dysfunctional tissues and enhance life expectancy. Supramolecular adhesive 
hydrogels are emerging as appealing materials for tissue engineering 
applications owing to their favorable attributes such as tailorable structure, 
inherent flexibility, excellent biocompatibility, near-physiological 
environment, dynamic mechanical strength, and particularly attractive 
self-adhesiveness. In this review, the key design principles and various 
supramolecular strategies to construct adhesive hydrogels are comprehensively 
summarized. Thereafter, the recent research progress regarding their tissue 
engineering applications, including primarily dermal tissue repair, muscle 
tissue repair, bone tissue repair, neural tissue repair, vascular tissue repair, 
oral tissue repair, corneal tissue repair, cardiac tissue repair, fetal membrane 
repair, hepatic tissue repair, and gastric tissue repair, is systematically 
highlighted. Finally, the scientific challenges and the remaining opportunities 
are underlined to show a full picture of the supramolecular adhesive hydrogels. 
This review is expected to offer comparative views and critical insights to 
inspire more advanced studies on supramolecular adhesive hydrogels and pave the 
way for different fields even beyond tissue engineering applications.

In light of the increasing life expectancy of Europe's population and the rising 
significance of active and healthy ageing relating thereto, an integrated 
approach of nutritional care within primary health care is gaining importance. 
The aim of the review was to summarize evidence on the effectiveness of 
nutritional interventions in primary health care. The scoping review is based 
upon a comprehensive literature search of relevant literature published between 
January 2010 and August 2021 in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews, Embase and Medline databases. Overall, 15 studies were included for 
evidence synthesis and interventions were basically clustered according to their 
type, into 1) eHealth and tele-medical interventions; 2) targeted single 
interventions; and 3) comprehensive, multi-faceted interventions. The review 
presents diverging evidence regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of 
interventions for nutritional care in primary health care, however, demonstrates 
encouraging outcomes. eHealth and tele-medical interventions partly show a 
careful positive tendency. Likewise, manifold single interventions on patient 
level present significant improvements in patient health outcomes. Multifaceted 
and comprehensive interventions found in the literature also partly demonstrate 
significant changes in intervention groups. Primary health care represents a 
critical setting for the care of older citizens and patients with complex health 
needs. This scoping review provides an overview of current nutrition care 
practices in primary health care and results reinforce the need to strengthen 
implementation of multi-faceted interventions carried out by the 
inter-disciplinary primary care team for advanced nutritional care.

Nutritional and Physical Prehabilitation in Elective Orthopedic Surgery: 
Rationale and Proposal for Implementation.

In the past, good food and exercise were not considered effective interventions 
to promote recovery in orthopedic surgery, and prolonged bed rest with not many 
calories has been deemed sufficient for the proper health restoration until the 
end of the nineteenth century. The advancement of scientific knowledge proved 
just the opposite, thus pushing health professionals to sustain the nutritional 
status and physical fitness of surgical patients. Nevertheless, the 
impoverishment of lifestyles and the lengthening of life expectancy have 
invariably contrasted the strength of constitution, giving rise to two of the 
most hazardous conditions for orthopedic patients: malnutrition and sarcopenia, 
often hiding nutrient deficits and poor body composition. These conditions are 
known to be negative prognostic factors in several areas of major surgery, 
including hip replacement, knee replacement, and spine surgery. Scoring systems 
to screen for malnutrition and physical inabilities exist, but disciplined 
management of the derived risks remains untested, potentially hindering the 
implementation of research findings into practice. A methodical approach of 
preoperative analysis, critical monitoring, and risk correction before surgery 
could lead to a substantial improvement of the prognosis while warranting the 
safety of patients and the efficiency of enhanced recovery after surgery 
pathways. The aim of this article is to discuss from a dietetic and exercise 
perspective the ideal nutritional and physical prehabilitation to lay the 
foundations for designing the appropriate integration of dietitians and 
physiotherapists in a preoperative enhanced recovery pathway. This methodical 
analysis could effectively calculate the patient's risks, detect the best 
choices for resolving the risk, underline the ignored aspects of perioperative 
care, and represent a concrete means to integrate novel discoveries.

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase promotes the epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition in lung cancer cells by enhancing c-MET upregulation.

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the essential catalytic subunit 
of telomerase, is associated with telomere homeostasis to prevent replicative 
senescence and cellular aging. However, hTERT reactivation also has been linked 
to the acquisition of several hallmarks of cancer, although the underlying 
mechanism beyond telomere extension remains elusive. This study demonstrated 
that hTERT overexpression promotes, whereas its inhibition by shRNA suppresses, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung cancer cells (A549 and H1299). 
We found that hTERT modulates the expression of EMT markers E-cadherin, 
vimentin, and cytokeratin-18a through upregulation of the c-MET. Ectopic 
expression of hTERT induces expression of c-MET, while hTERT-shRNA treatment 
significantly decreases the c-MET level in A549 and H1299 through differential 
expression of p53 and c-Myc. Reporter assay suggests the regulation of c-MET 
expression by hTERT to be at the promoter level. An increase in c-MET level 
significantly promotes the expression of mesenchymal markers, including vimentin 
and N-cadherin, while a notable increase in epithelial markers E-cadherin and 
cytokeratin-18a is observed after the c-MET knockdown in A549.

The quality of healthcare services and outcomes in the Pacific vary widely, with 
some countries enjoying some of the world's longest life expectancies, others 
have high rates of maternal and child mortality and relatively low life 
expectancy. Nurses and midwives make up more than two thirds of the regional 
regulated healthcare workforce. This paper argues that if countries are to meet 
Universal Health Coverage  nursing and midwifery leaders need to be explicitly 
involved in shaping policy  at the highest levels of government to optimise 
individual and community health both now and in the future. Using United Nations 
2019  declaration towards building a healthier world, this paper provides a 
rationale for inclusion of these leaders  into national and regional 
decisionmaking forums related to health policy to provide an informed voice in 
ministerial deliberations on health policy. We suggest that following several 
comprehensive regional and global studies, South Pacific Chief Nursing and 
Midwifery Officer Alliance  and the newly developed Pacific Heads of Nurses and 
Midwifery provide a vehicle for this to occur. As outlined in the WHO Strategic 
Directions, it is now time to embed Chief Nurses in national and regional health 
policy development.

BACKGROUND: Surgery for geriatric proximal femoral fractures (PF) is associated 
with high mortality rates within the first year. Studies with follow-up of at 
least 10 years after surgery are lacking.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on our database, we reviewed patients with PF who 
underwent surgery and were followed for a minimum of 10 years. Only patients 
aged 65-99 years were included. The primary endpoint was survival compared to 
the mean life expectancy of the general population evaluated by the German 
Federal Statistical Office. The secondary endpoint was any revision later than 
1 year after surgery. After a minimum of 10 years telephone calls were conducted 
with living patients or their relatives.
