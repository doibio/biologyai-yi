BACKGROUND: The burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is rising globally, 
with substantial variation in levels and trends of disease in different 
countries and regions. Understanding these geographical differences is crucial 
for formulating effective strategies for preventing and treating IBD. We report 
the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of IBD in 195 countries and 
territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.
METHODS: We modelled mortality due to IBD using a standard Cause of Death 
Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the 
non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital 
discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression 
tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of 
life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated. All of the estimates were 
reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UI).
FINDINGS: In 2017, there were 6·8 million (95% UI 6·4-7·3) cases of IBD 
globally. The age-standardised prevalence rate increased from 79·5 (75·9-83·5) 
per 100 000 population in 1990 to 84·3 (79·2-89·9) per 100 000 population in 
2017. The age-standardised death rate decreased from 0·61 (0·55-0·69) per 
100 000 population in 1990 to 0·51 (0·42-0·54) per 100 000 population in 2017. 
At the GBD regional level, the highest age-standardised prevalence rate in 2017 
occurred in high-income North America (422·0 [398·7-446·1] per 100 000) and the 
lowest age-standardised prevalence rates were observed in the Caribbean (6·7 
[6·3-7·2] per 100 000 population). High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations 
had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate, while low SDI regions had the 
lowest age-standardised prevalence rate. At the national level, the USA had the 
highest age-standardised prevalence rate (464·5 [438·6-490·9] per 100 000 
population), followed by the UK (449·6 [420·6-481·6] per 100 000). Vanuatu had 
the highest age-standardised death rate in 2017 (1·8 [0·8-3·2] per 100 000 
population) and Singapore had the lowest (0·08 [0·06-0·14] per 100 000 
population). The total YLDs attributed to IBD almost doubled over the study 
period, from 0·56 million (0·39-0·77) in 1990 to 1·02 million (0·71-1·38) in 
2017. The age-standardised rate of DALYs decreased from 26·5 (21·0-33·0) per 
100 000 population in 1990 to 23·2 (19·1-27·8) per 100 000 population in 2017.
INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of IBD increased substantially in many regions 
from 1990 to 2017, which might pose a substantial social and economic burden on 
governments and health systems in the coming years. Our findings can be useful 
for policy makers developing strategies to tackle IBD, including the education 
of specialised personnel to address the burden of this complex disease.

INTRODUCTION: Thalassemias are the most common human monogenic disorders in the 
world. Regular blood transfusion and increased intestinal absorption of iron 
among thalassemia patients will lead to iron overload, which will not only 
markedly decrease their life expectancy but also pose a heavy burden to the 
healthcare system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of 
knowledge, attitude and practice towards dietary iron among thalassemia patients 
and their caregivers.
METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study using purposive sampling method was 
conducted at eight thalassemia societies in Peninsular Malaysia. 260 respondents 
comprised of patients and caregivers were assessed with two separate sets of 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: Knowledge on dietary iron among the respondents was unsatisfactory, 
despite them having good knowledge on thalassemia disorder. Female patients were 
found to have better dietary knowledge, attitude and practice compared to males. 
The percentage of caregivers with good attitude and good practice were 
significantly higher compared to adult patients. Caregivers with children on 
iron chelators were noted to have better dietary attitude and practice. 
Thalassemia knowledge and children on vitamins were found to be the predictors 
of dietary knowledge among the patients and caregivers respectively.
CONCLUSION: The level of knowledge on dietary iron among the patients and 
caregivers was unsatisfactory in spite of their attitude and practice towards 
dietary iron were good. Effective delivery of dietary information to the 
patients and caregivers is essential to enable them to choose a healthy diet for 
their condition.

This paper investigates the ability of subjective expectations about life 
expectancy to predict wealth holding patterns in later life. Based on panel data 
from the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old, we estimate a 
structural life-cycle model with bequests. Each individual's subjective survival 
rates in the future are estimated with data on his belief of survival 
probabilities to a target age. This estimation is build upon a Bayesian updating 
method developed in Gan et al. (2005). We find that life-cycle model using 
subjective survival rates performs better than using life-table survival rates 
in predicting wealth holdings. This result suggests that subjective survival 
expectations play an important role in deciding consumption and savings. In 
addition, the estimation results show that most bequests are involuntary or 
accidental.

University, Princeton, NJ, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To examine trends in inequality in life expectancy and age-specific 
death rates across 40 US spatial units from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: We use multiple cause-of-death data from vital statistics to estimate 
measures of inequality in mortality across metropolitan status and geographic 
region. We consider trends for 5-year age intervals and examine inequality in 
cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS: For both sexes, spatial inequality in life expectancy and all-cause 
mortality above age 25 rose between 2002-04 and 2014-16. During this period, the 
standard deviation in life expectancy at birth increased by 19% for males and by 
44% for females. Areas that had higher life expectancy at the beginning of the 
period enjoyed larger gains in life expectancy. Especially noteworthy are 
divergent trends between large central metropolitan areas on the coasts and 
non-metropolitan areas in Appalachia and the South. Spatial inequality in 
mortality from lung cancer/respiratory diseases rose substantially, particularly 
for older women. Spatial inequality in mortality from the combination of drug 
overdose, alcohol use, and suicide increased at ages 30-34, but declined at ages 
50-54 and 70-74. Inequality in mortality from circulatory diseases, the largest 
cause of death, grew for some groups, particularly 30-34 year-old women. 
Mortality from screenable cancers, an indicator of the performance of medical 
systems, showed relatively little spatial disparity during the period.
CONCLUSIONS: Spatial inequality in life expectancy at birth and adult mortality 
has increased in recent decades.

The discovery of drugs to treat tuberculosis (TB) was a major medical milestone 
in the twentieth century. However, from the outset, drug resistance was 
observed. Currently, of the 10 million people that exhibit TB symptoms each 
year, 450,000 have multidrug or extensively drug resistant (MDR or XDR) TB. 
While greater understanding of the host and pathogen (Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, Mtb) coupled with scientific ingenuity will lead to new drugs and 
vaccines, in the meantime 4000 people die daily from TB. Thus, efforts to 
improve existing TB drugs should also be prioritized. Improved efficacy and 
decreased dose and associated toxicity of existing drugs would translate to 
greater compliance, life expectancy and quality of life of Mtb infected 
individuals. One potential strategy to improve existing drugs is to deliver them 
by inhalation as aerosols to the lung, the primary site of Mtb infection. 
Inhaled drugs are used for other pulmonary diseases, but they have yet to be 
utilized for TB. Inhaled therapies for TB represent an untapped opportunity that 
the pharmaceutical, clinical and regulatory communities should consider.

There is growing interest in the use of "distributionally-sensitive" forms of 
economic evaluation that capture both the impact of an intervention upon average 
population health and the distribution of that health amongst the population. 
This review aims to inform the conduct of distributionally sensitive evaluations 
in the UK by answering three questions: (1) How averse are the UK public towards 
inequalities in lifetime health between socioeconomic groups? (2) Does this 
aversion differ depending upon the type of health under consideration? (3) Are 
the UK public as averse to inequalities in health between socioeconomic groups 
as they are to inequalities in health between neutrally framed groups? EMBASE, 
MEDLINE, EconLit, and SSCI were searched for stated preference studies relevant 
to these questions in October 2017. Of the 2155 potentially relevant papers 
identified, 15 met the predefined hierarchical eligibility criteria. Seven 
elicited aversion to inequalities in health between socioeconomic groups, and 
eight elicited aversion between neutrally labelled groups. We find general, 
although not universal, evidence for aversion to inequalities in lifetime health 
between socioeconomic groups, albeit with significant variation in the strength 
of that preference across studies. Second, limited evidence regarding the impact 
of the type of health upon aversion. Third, some evidence that the UK public are 
more averse to inequalities in lifetime health when those inequalities are 
presented in the context of socioeconomic inequality than when presented in 
isolation.

The contribution of real-world evidence to cost-effectiveness analysis: case 
study of Dabigatran etexilate in France.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the differences between an ex 
ante and an ex post cost-effectiveness analysis of Dabigatran etexilate vs VKAs 
for the prevention of thromboembolic events in non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
patients and to draw lessons on the design and use of real-world data for 
decision making.
METHODS: The same model was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness ratio using 
two sets of parameters. One set included the efficacy and safety outcomes data 
from RE-LY, the pivotal trial comparing Dabigatran to warfarin; cost data came 
from an ex ante publication. Outcomes data for the second set came from 
real-world data studies. Cost data were a mix of real-world data and other 
sources. Two treatment strategies were compared: treatment initiation by either 
Dabigatran or VKAs, followed by either VKAs or Dabigatran. A crude comparison of 
results was performed; the impact of data differences was then assessed. 
Probabilistic sensitivity results of the two analyses were compared.
RESULTS: With real-world evidence, Dabigatran at both dosages was more effective 
for the prevention of ischemic strokes, intra-cranial haemorrhages, with less 
major extra-cranial haemorrhages and a similar risk of myocardial infarction. 
Using clinical trial data, Dabigatran150 mg (resp. Dabigatran110 mg) as a 
first-line treatment vs VKAs yielded an ICER of € 8077/QALY (resp. € 
13,116/QALY). Real-world evidence scenarios were cost-saving and more effective 
for both dosages.
CONCLUSION: The reassessment of outcomes and cost data had an impact on results, 
improving the efficiency of Dabigatran. We identify methodological issues which 
should be discussed if post-launch RWE based cost-effectiveness data become a 
standard in HTA decision making.

Advances in diagnosis and therapeutic technologies have brought increased life 
expectancy for most cancers, but paradoxically it also has increased the risk of 
second primary malignancies. Cancer survivors have a higher risk of developing 
cancer than the general population. This suggests that more studies are needed 
to develop screen and management programs for cancer survivors, especially 
patients with gastrointestinal cancers, which are the most common cancers in 
Korea.

Decreased life expectancy (LE) has historically been found among people with 
intellectual disability (ID) compared to the general population. Several recent 
studies have looked into ageing and cause of death in ID. Results of many of 
these studies suggest that, although LE in ID remains lower than the general 
population, it has increased across many Western societies in recent decades. 
Increases in LE in the general and ID populations appear to follow similar 
trends. Some major causes of mortality in ID are similar to the general 
population, and therefore may be amenable to similar preventative healthcare 
interventions. In this article, we have outlined possible reasons for improved 
LE in ID, and potential areas that may require further intervention. However, 
more detailed studies on mortality in ID may provide more accurate insight into 
areas requiring intervention in ID populations.

Pyrophosphate Linkage.

Achieving multiple cycles of RNA replication within a model protocell would be a 
critical step toward demonstrating a path from prebiotic chemistry to cellular 
biology. Any model for early life based on an "RNA world" must account for RNA 
strand cleavage and hydrolysis, which would degrade primitive genetic 
information and lead to an accumulation of truncated, phosphate-terminated 
strands. We show here that cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone is not an end 
point for RNA replication. Instead, 3'-phosphate-terminated RNA strands can 
participate in template-directed copying reactions with activated ribonucleotide 
monomers. These reactions form a pyrophosphate linkage, the stability of which 
we have characterized in the context of RNA copying chemistry. The presence of 
free magnesium cations results in cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond within 
minutes. However, we found that the pyrophosphate bond is relatively stable 
within an RNA duplex and in the presence of chelated magnesium. We show that, 
under these conditions, pyrophosphate-linked RNA can act as a template for the 
polymerization of ribonucleotides into canonical 3'-5' phosphodiester-linked 
RNA. We suggest that primer extension of 3'-phosphate-terminated RNA followed by 
template-directed copying represents a plausible nonenzymatic pathway for the 
salvage and recovery of genetic information following strand cleavage.

BACKGROUND: Conservative management, an approach to treating end-stage kidney 
disease without dialysis, while generally associated with shorter life 
expectancy than treatment with dialysis, is associated with fewer 
hospitalizations, better functional status and, potentially, better quality of 
life. Conservative management is a well-established treatment approach in a 
number of Western countries, including the United Kingdom (U.K.). In contrast, 
despite clinical practice guidelines in the United States (U.S.) recommending 
that nephrologists discuss all treatment options, including conservative 
management, with stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease patients, studies suggest 
that this rarely occurs. Therefore, we explored U.S. nephrologists' approaches 
to decision-making about dialysis and perspectives on conservative management 
among older adults.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative research study. We interviewed 20 
nephrologists - 15 from academic centers and 5 from community practices - 
utilizing a semi-structured interview guide containing open-ended questions. 
Interview transcripts were analyzed using grounded thematic analysis in which 
codes were generated inductively and iteratively modified, and themes were 
identified. Transcripts were coded independently by two investigators, and 
interviews were conducted until thematic saturation.
RESULTS: Twenty nephrologists (85% white, 75% male, mean age 50) participated in 
interviews. We found that decision-making about dialysis initiation in older 
adults can create emotional burden for nephrologists. We identified four themes 
that reflected factors that contribute to this emotional burden including 
nephrologists' perspectives that: 1) uncertainty exists about how a patient will 
do on dialysis, 2) the alternative to dialysis is death, 3) confronting death is 
difficult, and 4) patients do not regret initiating dialysis. Three themes 
revealed different decision-making strategies that nephrologists use to reduce 
this emotional burden: 1) convincing patients to "just do it" (i.e. dialysis), 
2) shifting the decision-making responsibility to patients, and 3) utilizing 
time-limited trials of dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: A decision not to start dialysis and instead pursue conservative 
management can be emotionally burdensome for nephrologists for a number of 
reasons including clinical uncertainty about prognosis on dialysis and 
discomfort with death. Nephrologists' attempts to reduce this burden may be 
reflected in different decision-making styles - paternalistic, informed, and 
shared decision-making. Shared decision-making may relieve some of the emotional 
burden while preserving patient-centered care.

BACKGROUND: Variations in thyroid function within reference ranges are 
associated with increased risk of diseases and death. However, the impact of 
thyroid function on life expectancy (LE) with and without noncommunicable 
diseases (NCDs) remains unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate the 
association of thyroid function with total LE and LE with and without NCD among 
euthyroid individuals.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, a 
prospective population-based study carried out in the Netherlands. In total, 
7,644 participants without known thyroid disease and with thyroid-stimulating 
hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels within reference ranges were 
eligible. NCDs were defined as presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes 
mellitus type 2, or cancer. We used the demographic tool of multistate life 
tables to calculate LE estimates at the age of 50 years, using prevalence, 
incidence rates, and hazard ratios for three transitions (healthy to NCD, 
healthy to death, and NCD to death). The total LE and LE with and without NCD 
among TSH and FT4 tertiles were calculated separately in men and women. Analyses 
were adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors. The mean 
(standard deviation) age of the participants was 64.5 (9.7) years, and 52.3% 
were women. Over a median follow-up of 8 years (interquartile range 2.7-9.9 
years), 1,396 incident NCD events and 1,422 deaths occurred. Compared with those 
in the lowest TSH tertile, men and women in the highest TSH tertile were 
expected to live 1.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-2.3, p < 0.001) and 
1.5 years (CI 0.8-2.2, p < 0.001) longer, respectively, of which 1.4 years (CI 
0.5-2.3, p = 0.002) and 1.3 years (CI 0.3-2.1, p = 0.004) with NCD. Compared 
with those in the lowest FT4 tertile, the difference in LE for men and women in 
the highest FT4 tertile was -3.7 years (CI -5.1 to -2.2, p < 0.001) and -3.3 
years (CI -4.7 to -1.9, p < 0.001), respectively, of which -1.8 years (CI -3.1 
to -0.7, p = 0.003) and -2.0 years (CI -3.4 to -0.7, p = 0.003) without NCD. A 
limitation of the study is the observational design. Thus, the possibility of 
residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that people with low-normal thyroid 
function (i.e., highest tertile of TSH and lowest tertile of FT4 reference 
ranges) are expected to live more years with and without NCD than those with 
high-normal thyroid function (i.e., lowest tertile of TSH and highest tertile of 
FT4 reference ranges). These findings provide support for a re-evaluation of the 
current reference ranges of thyroid function.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct cost effectiveness and benefit-cost analyses of the 
organized mammography-screening program in the Republic of Kazakhstan comparing 
women who developed breast cancer in screened and unscreened scenario.
METHODS: 389,352 screened women were included in the study. Among these, 895 
women were further diagnosed with breast cancer. Outcomes measures include life 
years saved, quality-adjusted life years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
and value of statistical life year. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to no screening scenario, an organized mammography yielded an 
additional 1,253 life years and 790 quality-adjusted life years in 2016. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was equal to 3,157 USD per one QALY saved, 
which is two times less than the GDP per capita in Kazakhstan in 2016. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that the mammography remains cost-effective in the 
majority of the scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Mammography screening in Kazakhstan was found to be highly 
cost-effective, associated with treatment cost savings, and can be an efficient 
use of limited resources in Kazakhstan.

Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are known to have reduced life expectancy 
and be at increased risk for multiple morbidities including serious infection. 
However, published data on DM outcomes after left ventricular assist device 
(LVAD) implantation are sparse, inconsistent and individual studies are small 
with limited power. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
compare survival and adverse events post-LVAD in DM versus non-DM (NDM) 
patients. Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Central databases were searched for 
studies comparing outcomes in DM and NDM patients who underwent LVAD 
implantation for advanced heart failure. Results were reported as random effect 
risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. We identified 5 retrospective 
cohort studies, at low risk of bias, reporting on 1,351 patients (n = 488 DM). 
There was increased 30-day mortality (RR 1.57 [1.00, 2.47]; p = 0.05; I2 = 0%) 
among DM versus NDM. The DM and NDM groups did not differ significantly in terms 
of 1-year mortality (RR 1.15 [0.98, 1.35]; p = 0.08; I2 = 39%), device-related 
infection (RR 1.05 [0.92, 1.19]; p = 0.88; I2 = 0%), ischemic stroke (RR 1.29 
[0.91, 1.83]; p = 0.69; I2 = 0%), hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.10 [0.42, 2.83]; 
p = 0.85; I2 = 69%), or bleeding (RR 1.06 [0.80, 1.40]; p = 0.70; I2 = 27%). 
After LVAD implantation, patients with DM, versus patients without, have a 
modestly elevated 30-day mortality rate. However, 1-year mortality and morbidity 
did not differ.

BACKGROUND: Neurological impairments might significantly contribute to reduced 
life expectancy in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). There are no 
empirical studies of premature mortality in children with neurological 
impairments in Africa. This study estimated the risk of premature mortality in 
children with neurological impairments and identified risk factors and causes of 
death.
METHODS: We did a cohort study based on a two-stage epidemiological survey in 
the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kilifi, Kenya). Study 
participants were children aged 6-9 years. In the first stage, five trained 
field workers administered a low-cost screening tool to a random sample of 
households. In the second stage, we assessed for neurological impairments in 
five domains (epilepsy, cognitive impairments, vision impairments, hearing 
impairments, and motor impairments) using comprehensive clinical evaluation and 
extensive neuropsychological assessments. From the two-stage survey we 
identified a cohort of children with neurological impairment and a cohort of 
matched controls. We also enrolled an age-matched sample from the general 
population. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Mortality rates, 
standardised mortality ratio (SMR), and hazard ratios (HR) for risk factors were 
estimated and causes of death identified.
FINDINGS: We enrolled 306 children with neurological impairment, 9912 survey 
controls, and 22 873 age-matched participants from the general population, and 
followed up the cohorts between June 1, 2001, and Aug 31, 2018. Median follow-up 
was 14·5 years (IQR 8·6-17·2). 11 (3·9%) of 284 children with neurological 
impairment, 92 (1·0%) of 9009 controls, and 272 (1·2%) of 22 873 participants in 
the general population sample died during the follow-up. Overall mortality rates 
were 309·8 per 100 000 person-years of observation (95% CI 126·7-492·9) in 
children with neurological impairment, 80·8 per 100 000 person-years of 
observation (64·3-97·3) in controls, and 98·8 per 100 000 person-years of 
observation (87·1-110·6) in the general population sample (mortality rate ratio 
3·83, 95% CI 2·05-7·16, p<0·001, compared with controls; 3·13, 1·71-5·72, 
p<0·001, compared with the general population). Mortality risk in children with 
neurological impairment was not dependent on the severity of impairment 
(p=0·291) nor on a specific neurological impairment domain (p=0·205). The 
overall risk of death adjusted for age and sex was higher in children with 
neurological impairment compared with controls (HR 4·24, 95% CI 2·26-7·94, 
p=0·002). An SMR of 3·15 (95% CI 1·66-5·49) was obtained after using the general 
population sample as the reference for indirect standardisation. In 
multivariable risk factor analysis, developmental delay (adjusted HR 18·92, 95% 
CI 2·23-160·44, p=0·007) and severe malnutrition (20·92, 3·14-139·11, p=0·002) 
increased the risk of mortality in children with neurological impairment. 
Infections such as HIV/AIDS and accidents were common among all decedents.
INTERPRETATION: The risk of premature mortality was higher in children diagnosed 
with neurological impairments compared with the general population and was 
increased by developmental delay and severe malnutrition. Child development and 
nutritional status should be assessed in all children in LMICs and tailored 
interventions started to improve outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the rate of change of clinical outcome measures in 
children with 2 types of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), COL6-related 
dystrophies (COL6-RDs) and LAMA2-related dystrophies (LAMA2-RDs).
METHODS: Over the course of 4 years, 47 individuals (23 with COL6-RD and 24 with 
LAMA2-RD) 4 to 22 years of age were evaluated. Assessments included the Motor 
Function Measure 32 (MFM32), myometry (knee flexors and extensors, elbow flexors 
and extensors), goniometry (knee and elbow extension), pulmonary function tests, 
and quality-of-life measures. Separate linear mixed-effects models were fitted 
for each outcome measurement, with subject-specific random intercepts.
RESULTS: Total MFM32 scores for COL6-RDs and LAMA2-RDs decreased at a rate of 
4.01 and 2.60 points, respectively, each year (p < 0.01). All muscle groups 
except elbow flexors for individuals with COL6-RDs decreased in strength between 
1.70% (p < 0.05) and 2.55% (p < 0.01). Range-of-motion measurements decreased by 
3.21° (p < 0.05) at the left elbow each year in individuals with LAMA2-RDs and 
2.35° (p < 0.01) in right knee extension each year in individuals with COL6-RDs. 
Pulmonary function demonstrated a yearly decline in sitting forced vital 
capacity percent predicted of 3.03% (p < 0.01) in individuals with COL6-RDs. 
There was no significant change in quality-of-life measures analyzed.
CONCLUSION: Results of this study describe the rate of change of motor function 
as measured by the MFM32, muscle strength, range of motion, and pulmonary 
function in individuals with COL6-RDs and LAMA2-RDs.

BACKGROUND: Delayed access to surgical care for congenital conditions in low- 
and middle-income countries is associated with increased risk of death and 
life-long disabilities, although the actual burden of delayed access to care is 
unknown. Our goal was to quantify the burden of disease related to delays to 
surgical care for children with congenital surgical conditions in Somaliland.
METHODS: We collected data from medical records on all children (n = 280) 
receiving surgery for a proxy set of congenital conditions over a 12-month time 
period across all 15 surgically equipped hospitals in Somaliland. We defined 
delay to surgical care for each condition as the difference between the ideal 
and the actual ages at the time of surgery. Disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) attributable to these delays were calculated and compared by the type of 
condition, travel distance to care, and demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: We found long delays in surgical care for these 280 children with 
congenital conditions, translating to a total of 2970 attributable delayed 
DALYs, or 8.4 avertable delayed DALYs per child, with the greatest burden among 
children with neurosurgical and anorectal conditions. Over half of the families 
seeking surgical care had to travel over 2 h to a surgically equipped hospital 
in the capital city of Hargeisa.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with congenital conditions in Somaliland experience 
substantial delays to surgical care and travel long distances to obtain care. 
Estimating the burden of delayed surgical care with avertable delayed DALYs 
offers a powerful tool for estimating the costs and benefits of interventions to 
improve the quality of surgical care.

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a clinical disorder without specific and 
effective therapeutic strategy, partly due to the lack of structural mechanisms 
for the defective ligand binding by mutated thyroid hormone receptors (THRs). We 
herein uncovered the prescription drug roxadustat as a novel THRβ-selective 
ligand with therapeutic potentials in treating RTH, thereby providing a small 
molecule tool enabling the first probe into the structural mechanisms of RTH. 
Despite a wide distribution of the receptor mutation sites, different THRβ 
mutants induce allosteric conformational modulation on the same His435 residue, 
which disrupts a critical hydrogen bond required for the binding of thyroid 
hormones. Interestingly, roxadustat retains hydrophobic interactions with THRβ 
via its unique phenyl extension, enabling the rescue of the activity of the THRβ 
mutants. Our study thus reveals a critical receptor allosterism mechanism for 
RTH by mutant THRβ, providing a new and viable therapeutic strategy for the 
treatment of RTH.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
analysis of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in locally 
advance or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) 1% or greater from the United 
States (US) payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Markov structure was developed to estimate cost and 
effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of 
locally advance or metastatic NSCLC based on the data from KEYNOTE-042. Cost and 
health outcomes were estimated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
$150,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in three PD-L1 TPS populations 
(≥50%, ≥20% and ≥1%). One-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
were to test the model stability. Subgroup analysis were performed in three 
PD-L1 TPS populations (≥50%, ≥20% and ≥1%).
