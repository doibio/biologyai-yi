OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of 4 months of customised, home-based 
exergaming on physical function and pain after total knee replacement (TKR) 
compared with standard exercise protocol.
METHODS: In this non-blinded randomised controlled trial, 52 individuals aged 
60-75 years undergoing TKR were randomised into an exergaming (intervention 
group, IG) or a standard exercising group (control group, CG). Primary outcomes 
were physical function and pain measured before and after (2 months and 4 
months) surgery using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) 
test. Secondary outcomes included measures of the Visual Analogue Scale, 10m 
walking, short physical performance battery, isometric knee extension and 
flexion force, knee range of movement and satisfaction with the operated knee.
RESULTS: Improvement in mobility measured by TUG was greater in the IG (n=21) at 
2 (p=0.019) and 4 months (p=0.040) than in the CG (n=25). The TUG improved in 
the IG by -1.9 s (95% CI, -2.9 to -1.0), while it changed by -0.6 s (95% CI -1.4 
to 0.3) in the CG. There were no differences between the groups in the OKS or 
secondary outcomes over 4 months. 100% of patients in the IG and 74% in the CG 
were satisfied with the operated knee.
CONCLUSION: In patients who have undergone TKR, training at home with customised 
exergames was more effective in mobility and early satisfaction and as effective 
as standard exercise in pain and other physical functions. In both groups, 
knee-related function and pain improvement can be considered clinically 
meaningful.

Current treatments for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have limited 
success in improving patients' quality of life and prolonging life expectancy. 
The clinical need for more efficient and safe therapies has contributed to the 
exploration of emerging strategies. Recently, there has been increased interest 
in oncolytic viruses (OVs) as a therapeutic modality for HCC. OVs undergo 
selective replication in cancerous tissues and kill tumor cells. Strikingly, 
pexastimogene devacirepvec (Pexa-Vec) was granted an orphan drug status in HCC 
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013. Meanwhile, dozens of OVs 
are being tested in HCC-directed clinical and preclinical trials. In this 
review, the pathogenesis and current therapies of HCC are outlined. Next, we 
summarize multiple OVs as single therapeutic agents for the treatment of HCC, 
which have demonstrated certain efficacy and low toxicity. Emerging carrier 
cell-, bioengineered cell mimetic- or nonbiological vehicle-mediated OV 
intravenous delivery systems in HCC therapy are described. In addition, we 
highlight the combination treatments between oncolytic virotherapy and other 
modalities. Finally, the clinical challenges and prospects of OV-based 
biotherapy are discussed, with the aim of continuing to develop a fascinating 
approach in HCC patients.

Lipaphis erysimi pseudobrassicae (Davis) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) are 
important pests of brassica crops, causing significant yield losses on cabbage 
in Ghana. To inform the development of ecologically sound and sustainable pest 
management strategies for these pests, their biological and population growth 
parameters were studied on three cabbage varieties (Oxylus, Fortune, and 
Leadercross). The study was conducted in a screen house under ambient conditions 
at 30 ± 1°C and 75 ± 5% RH and 12:12 h photoperiod from September to November 
2020. The parameters of the preadult developmental period, survival rates, 
longevity, reproduction, and life table were evaluated following the female 
age-specific life table. There were significant differences in the nymphal 
developmental time, longevity, and fecundity on the cabbage varieties for both 
aphid species. The highest population growth parameters, net reproductive rate 
(R0), intrinsic rate of increase r, and finite rate of increase (λ) were 
recorded on Oxylus variety for both L. e. pseudobrassicae and M. persicae. The 
lowest was recorded on Leadercross variety for L.e pseudobrassicae and Fortune 
for M. persicae. The results from this study suggest that Leadercross is a less 
suitable host for L. e. pseudobrassicae and Fortune for M. persicae, thus, 
should be considered as less susceptible varieties for use in primary pest 
management by small-scale farmers or as a component of an integrated pest 
management strategy for these pests on cabbage.

Evaluating the cost-utility of intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin versus 
radical cystectomy in patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
in the UK.

AIMS: Approximately 75% of bladder cancer (BC) cases present as 
non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC). In patients with high-risk NMIBC, the mainstay 
treatment is intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), with immediate radical 
cystectomy (RC) as an alternative treatment option. The aim of the present study 
was to evaluate the cost-utility of BCG versus RC in patients with high-risk 
NMIBC from the UK healthcare payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A six-state Markov model was developed that covered 
controlled disease, recurrence, progression to muscle-invasive BC, metastatic 
disease, and death. The model included adverse events of BCG and RC and 
monitoring and palliative care. Drug costs were obtained from the British 
National Formulary. Intravesical delivery, RC, and monitoring costs were sourced 
from the National Tariff Payment System and the literature. Utility data were 
obtained from the literature. Analyses were run over a 30-year time horizon, 
with future costs and effects discounted at 3.5% per annum. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The base case analysis comparing BCG with RC showed that BCG would 
increase life expectancy by 0.88 years versus RC, from 7.74 to 8.62 years. BCG 
resulted in an increase of 0.76 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus RC, 
from 5.63 to 6.39 QALYs. Patients incurred lower lifetime costs if treated with 
BCG (£47,753) than with RC (£64,264). Cost savings were mainly driven by the 
lower cost of BCG versus RC, and palliative care costs. Sensitivity analyses 
showed that results were robust to assumptions.
LIMITATIONS: The evidence base informing efficacy estimates of BCG is 
heterogeneous as different BCG administration schedules were reported in the 
literature, while incidence and cost data on some BCG-associated adverse events 
were sparse.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravesical BCG led to increased QALYs and reduced costs versus RC 
for patients with high-risk NMIBC from the UK healthcare payer perspective.

Plain Language Summary: Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a 
recommended immunotherapy option for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive 
bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have undergone transurethral resection of bladder 
tumor (TURBT). BCG is known for its high efficacy and good safety profile. 
However, current evidence on its effectiveness against other comparators such as 
radical cystectomy (RC) is limited, mainly because different BCG schedules are 
used, particularly with regard to maintenance therapy. Given this lack of 
evidence, we conducted the first cost-utility analysis which considers adequate 
BCG therapy relative to RC for the UK. We developed a Markov model that captured 
the effects of the intravesical BCG and RC on NMIBC, in addition to incidences 
of adverse events associated with either treatment. Costs of the two treatments, 
their administration, maintenance, and of treatments for adverse events were 
modelled alongside the quality-of-life effects of NMIBC, adverse events, and 
palliative care. We used published clinical data and UK cost data to inform our 
model. Our results show that BCG was associated with higher quality-adjusted 
life expectancy than RC and lower total costs from the healthcare system 
perspective. These results imply that adequate BCG immunotherapy is likely 
valuable for the National Healthcare System in terms of its effects on patients 
and indeed cost-saving relative to RC.

United States.

BACKGROUND: Previous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have described 
decreasing testosterone levels with age in men, without consideration of 
acquired comorbidities in aging males.
AIM: We evaluated the longitudinal association between age and testosterone 
levels as well as the impact of several comorbidities on this relationship using 
multivariate panel regression analysis.
METHODS: Participants were selected from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of 
Aging. Data were obtained on the presence of several comorbidities and total 
testosterone level during each follow-up visit. A multivariate panel regression 
analysis was performed to determine the impact of age on testosterone level 
while controlling for individual comorbidities.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes were strength of association between age and 
various comorbidities, and testosterone level.
RESULTS: A total of 625 men were included in this study, with a mean age of 
65 years and a mean testosterone level of 463 ng/dL. On multivariable-adjusted 
panel regression analysis, age was not significantly associated with 
testosterone decline, while anemia, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, obesity, 
peripheral artery disease, and stroke were inversely associated with total 
testosterone level. We report no association between cancer and total 
testosterone.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study indicates that a decline in testosterone 
levels over time may be due to the presence of various comorbidities, which 
affects the medical management of hypogonadism in aging men.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The strengths of this study include the standardized 
acquisition of testosterone tests and uniform collection of variables, while 
limitations include the lack of follow-up data from 205 patients and the limited 
racial/ethnic diversity in the cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large longitudinal study, we found that when adjusted for 
the presence of concomitant comorbidities, age does not predict a significant 
decline in testosterone level. With the overall increase in life expectancy and 
the simultaneous rise in the incidence of comorbidities such as diabetes and 
dyslipidemia, our findings may help optimize screening and treatment for 
late-onset hypogonadism in patients with multiple comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccination after excisional procedure compared with no vaccination.
METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model (TreeAge Pro 2021) to compare 
outcomes between patients who underwent an excisional procedure followed by 
nonavalent HPV vaccination to those who underwent an excisional procedure 
without vaccination. Our theoretical cohort contained 250,000 patients, the 
approximate number undergoing excisional procedures annually in the United 
States. Our outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), recurrence 
events, number of surveillance Pap tests with co-testing, number of 
colposcopies, and second excisional procedures. Probabilities of recurrence were 
based on a recently published meta-analysis. All values were derived from the 
literature, and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3%. Outcomes were applied for 
4 years after the initial excisional procedure. Our cost-effectiveness threshold 
was $100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the 
robustness of the model.
RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort of patients who underwent an excisional 
procedure, the HPV vaccination strategy was associated with 17,281 fewer 
recurrences of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (8,360 fewer cases of 
CIN 1 and 8,921 fewer cases of CIN 2 or 3), 26,203 fewer Pap tests (1,025,368 vs 
1,051,570), 17,281 fewer colposcopies (20,588 vs 37,869), and 8,921 fewer second 
excisional procedures (4,779 vs 13,701). The vaccination strategy was associated 
with a higher cost of $135 million. Vaccination was a cost-effective strategy, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $29,181 per QALY, compared with 
no vaccination. In our sensitivity analyses, the HPV vaccination strategy 
remained cost effective until the cost of the three-dose HPV vaccine series 
reached $1,899 or the baseline (nonvaccinated) probability of recurrence was 
less than 4.8%.
CONCLUSION: In our model, HPV vaccination for patients with a prior excisional 
procedure led to improved outcomes and was cost effective. Our study suggests 
that clinicians should consider offering the three-dose HPV vaccine series to 
patients who have undergone an excisional procedure to decrease the risk of CIN 
recurrence and its sequelae.

IMPORTANCE: US cities have substantial, but varying, levels of racial mortality 
inequities, a consequence of structural racism. As committed partners 
increasingly pledge to eliminate health inequities, local data are required to 
focus and unify efforts.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the contributions of 26 cause-of-death categories to Black 
to White life expectancy gaps within 3 large US cities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, data were 
extracted from the 2018 and 2019 National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause 
of Death Restricted Use data files for deaths by race, ethnicity, sex, age, 
place of residence, and underlying and contributing causes of death in 
Baltimore, Maryland; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles, California. Life 
expectancy at birth was calculated for non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White 
populations overall and by sex using abridged life tables with 5-year age 
intervals. Data analysis was performed from February to May 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using the Arriaga method, the proportion of the 
Black to White life expectancy gap was calculated overall and by sex for each 
city that was attributable to 26 cause-of-death categories defined using the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision codes for underlying and contributing causes of death.
RESULTS: A total of 66 321 death records from 2018 to 2019 were analyzed, with 
29 057 individuals (44%) were identified as Black, 34 745 (52%) as male, and 
46 128 (70%) as aged 65 years and older. Black to White life expectancy gaps 
were 7.60 years for Baltimore, 8.06 years for Houston, and 9.57 years for Los 
Angeles. Circulatory diseases, cancer, injuries, and diabetes and endocrine 
disorders were top contributors to the gaps, although the order and magnitude 
varied by city. The contribution of circulatory diseases was 11.3 percentage 
points higher in Los Angeles than in Baltimore (3.76 years [39.3%] vs 2.12 years 
[28.0%]). The contribution of injuries to Baltimore's racial gap (2.22 years 
[29.3%]) was twice as large as in Houston (1.11 years [13.8%]) and Los Angeles 
(1.36 years [14.2%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: By assessing the composition of Black to White life 
expectancy gaps for 3 large US cities and categorizing deaths at a more granular 
level than past studies, this study provides insight into the differing 
underpinnings of urban inequities. This type of local data can support local 
resource allocation that more effectively addresses racial inequities.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the growth rates, carcass quality, 
shelf-life, tenderness, sensory characteristics, volatile compounds, and fatty 
acid composition of wool, hair, and composite (wool × hair) lambs. Twenty-one 
wether lambs [wool (Suffolk × Polypay/Targhee; n = 7), hair (Dorper × Dorper; n 
= 7), and composite (Dorper × Polypay/Targhee; n = 7)] were fed from weaning to 
finishing at the University of Idaho Sheep Center and subsequently harvested 
under United States Department of Agriculture inspection at the University of 
Idaho Meat Lab. At 48 h postmortem, carcass measurements were taken to determine 
the percent boneless closely trimmed retail cuts, yield grade, and quality 
grade. Loins were fabricated from each carcass and wet-aged at 0°C until 10-d 
postmortem. Following aging, 2.54-cm bone-in loin chops were cut and randomly 
assigned to 4 d of retail display, Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF), or 
sensory analyses. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were analyzed on days 
0 and 4 of retail display while subjective and objective color measurements were 
observed once daily. Samples (24 g) were also collected for volatile compound 
and fatty acid analysis. A mixed model analysis of variance was used to assess 
breed differences. Discernable effects were considered at P < 0.05. Wool lambs 
had heavier hot carcass weights (P < 0.001), larger rib-eye area (P = 0.015), 
and higher dressing percent (P < 0.001) than the other breeds. There was an 
interaction observed between breed and days of retail display for browning (P = 
0.006). On day 1 chops from the composite breed had more browning than chops 
from the wool breed. No differences were observed between groups for lean muscle 
L* values (P = 0.432), a* values (P = 0.757), and b* values (P = 0.615). 
Differences were not observed in lipid oxidation (P = 0.159), WBSF (P = 0.540), 
or consumer acceptability (P = 0.295). There were differences found for 7 of the 
45 fatty acids detected and in 3 of the 67 volatile compounds detected. In 
conclusion, wool lambs were heavier and had a greater carcass yield than the 
hair lamb carcasses. Regardless of breed, consumers did not detect sensory 
traits that would impact their eating experience.

Plain Language Summary: The U.S. lamb industry has been steadily losing 
production operations since the 1990s due to a decline in lamb consumption, 
caused by consumer flavor preferences, an increase in synthetic fabrics, and 
importation from Australia and New Zealand. This has limited the overall need 
for U.S. producers. The focus of this research was to evaluate the differences 
among wool, hair, and composite groups of lamb for growth traits, carcass 
characteristics, shelf-life stability, consumer flavor, volatile compounds, and 
fatty acid profiling. The study found the wool group maintained a higher overall 
weight, as well as a taller shoulder height, and heart girth circumference over 
the hair group. The wool group also had a superior final carcass size; however, 
the quality grade did not differ between the composite and wool groups. There 
was no difference between groups for consumer sensory levels or cook loss. 
Minimal variation was shown throughout the retail shelf-life; however, general 
discoloration increased as expected during retail display. Tenderness levels 
between groups were also similar. Volatile compounds showed differences for 
three compounds with variation between groups. Fatty acid analysis also 
determined seven compounds of interest; however, common fatty acids known to be 
flavor factors were not different between groups.

BACKGROUND: Evaluating the burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) as the first 
cause of mortality worldwide is necessary to develop healthcare policies. This 
study aimed to report the national and subnational IHD burden and risk factors 
in Iran according to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019.
METHODS: We extracted, processed, and presented the results of the GBD 2019 
study regarding incidence, prevalence, deaths, years lived with disability 
(YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
attributable burden to risk factors of IHD in Iran during 1990-2019.
RESULTS: Age-standardized death and DALY rates decreased by 42.7% (95% 
uncertainty interval, 38.1-47.9) and 47.7% (43.6-52.9) during 1990-2019, slower 
since 2011 and reached 163.6 deaths (149.0-176.2), 2842.7 DALYs (2657.0-3103.1) 
per 100,000 persons in 2019. Meanwhile, with a lower reduction of 7.7% 
(6.0-9.5), the incidence rate reached 829.1 new cases (719.9-945.2) per 100,000 
persons in 2019. High systolic blood pressure and elevated low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) contributed to the highest deaths, and DALYs 
age-standardized rates in 1990 and 2019. They followed by high fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG), and high body-mass index (BMI) with an upward trend of 
contribution from 1990 to 2019. A convergence pattern in the provincial death 
age-standardized rate was observed, with the lowest rate in Iran's capital city; 
84.7 deaths per 100,000 (70.6-99.4) in 2019.
CONCLUSION: The incidence rate reduced remarkably lower than the mortality rate, 
which necessitates promoting primary prevention strategies. Also, interventions 
should be adopted to control growing risk factors like high FPG, and high BMI.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the protective effect of oral antidiabetic drugs in a 
large cohort of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes differing for age, 
clinical status, and life expectancy, including patients with multiple 
comorbidities and short survival.
METHODS: A nested case-control study was carried out by including the cohort of 
188,983 patients from Lombardy (Italy), aged ≥ 65 years, who received ≥ 3 
consecutive prescriptions of antidiabetic agents (mostly metformin and other 
older conventional agents) during 2012. Cases were the 49,201 patients who died 
for any cause during follow-up (up to 2018). A control was randomly selected for 
each case. Adherence to drug therapy was measured by considering the proportion 
of days of the follow-up covered by the drug prescriptions. Conditional logistic 
regression was used to model the risk of outcome associated with adherence to 
antidiabetic drugs. The analysis was stratified according to four categories of 
the clinical status (good, intermediate, poor, and very poor) differing for life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: There was a steep increase in comorbidities and a marked reduction of 
the 6-year survival from the very good to the very poor (or frail) clinical 
category. Progressive increase in adherence to treatment was associated with a 
progressive decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality in all clinical 
categories and at all ages (65-74, 75-84 and ≥ 85 years) except for the frail 
patient subgroup aged ≥ 85 years. The mortality reduction from lowest to highest 
adherence level showed a tendency to be lower in frail patients compared to the 
other categories. Similar although less consistent results were obtained for 
cardiovascular mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly diabetic patients, increased adherence to antidiabetic 
drugs is associated with a reduction in the risk of mortality regardless of the 
patients' clinical status and age, with the exception of very old patients 
(age ≥ 85 years) in the very poor or frail clinical category. However, in the 
frail patient category the benefit of treatment appears to be less than in 
patients in good clinical conditions.

The evolution of antiretroviral therapies (ART) has tremendously improved the 
life expectancy of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH), 
which is currently similar to the general population. However, as PLWH are now 
living longer, they exhibit various comorbidities such as a higher risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(AIDS)-defined malignancies. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is the acquisition of 
somatic mutations by the hematopoietic stem cells, rendering them survival and 
growth benefit, thus leading to their clonal dominance in the bone marrow. 
Recent epidemiologic studies have highlighted that PLWH have a higher prevalence 
of CH, which in turn is associated with increased CVD risk. Thus, a link between 
HIV infection and a higher risk for CVD might be explained through the induction 
of inflammatory signaling in the monocytes carrying CH mutations. Among the 
PLWH, CH is associated with an overall poorer control of HIV infection; an 
association that requires further mechanistic evaluation. Finally, CH is linked 
to an increased risk of progression to myeloid neoplasms including 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which are 
associated with particularly poor outcomes among patients with HIV infection. 
These bidirectional associations require further molecular-level understanding, 
highlighting the need for more preclinical and prospective clinical studies. 
This review summarizes the current literature on the association between CH and 
HIV infection.

The Interplay of Dietary Fibers and Intestinal Microbiota Affects Type 2 
Diabetes by Generating Short-Chain Fatty Acids.

Foods contain dietary fibers which can be classified into soluble and insoluble 
forms. The nutritional composition of fast foods is considered unhealthy because 
it negatively affects the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Dietary 
fiber is resistant to digestive enzymes in the gut, which modulates the 
anaerobic intestinal microbiota (AIM) and fabricates SCFAs. Acetate, butyrate, 
and propionate are dominant in the gut and are generated via Wood-Ljungdahl and 
acrylate pathways. In pancreatic dysfunction, the release of insulin/glucagon is 
impaired, leading to hyperglycemia. SCFAs enhance insulin sensitivity or 
secretion, beta-cell function, leptin release, mitochondrial function, and 
intestinal gluconeogenesis in human organs, which positively affects type 2 
diabetes (T2D). Research models have shown that SCFAs either enhance the release 
of peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from L-cells 
(entero-endocrine), or promotes the release of leptin hormone in adipose tissues 
through G-protein receptors GPR-41 and GPR-43. Dietary fiber is a component that 
influences the production of SCFAs by AIM, which may have beneficial effects on 
T2D. This review focuses on the effectiveness of dietary fiber in producing 
SCFAs in the colon by the AIM as well as the health-promoting effects on T2D.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of varying concentrations 
of longkong pericarp extract (LPE) on the physicochemical properties of 
alginate-based edible nanoparticle coatings (NP-ALG) on shrimp. For developing 
the nanoparticles, the alginate coating emulsion with different LPE 
concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) was ultrasonicated at 210 W with a frequency 
of 20 kHz for 10 min and a pulse duration of 1s on and 4 off. After that, the 
coating emulsion was separated into four treatments (T): T1: Coating solution 
containing basic ALG composition and without the addition of LPE or 
ultrasonication treatment; T2: ALG coating solution converted into nano-sized 
particles with ultrasonication and containing 0.5% LPE; T3: ALG coating solution 
converted into nano-sized particles with ultrasonication and containing 1.0% 
LPE; T4: ALG coating solution converted into nano-sized particles with 
ultrasonication and containing 1.5% LPE. A control (C) was also used, where 
distilled water was used instead of ALG coating. Before coating the shrimp, all 
the coating materials were tested for pH, viscosity, turbidity, whiteness index, 
particle size, and polydispersity index. The control samples had the highest pH 
and whiteness index and was followed by the lowest viscosity and turbidity (p < 
0.05). Among the T1-T4 coating materials, T4 coating had higher turbidity, 
particle size, polydispersity index, but lower pH, viscosity, and whiteness 
index (p < 0.05). To study the quality and shelf-life of the shrimp, all coated 
shrimp samples were refrigerated at 4 °C for a period of 14 days. At 2-day 
intervals, physiochemical and microbial analyses were performed. The coated 
shrimp also had a lower increase in pH and weight loss over the storage period 
(p < 0.05). Coatings containing 1.5% LPE significantly reduced the polyphenol 
oxidase activity in the shrimp (p > 0.05). The addition of LPE to NP-ALG 
coatings demonstrated dose-dependent antioxidant activity against protein and 
lipid oxidation. The highest LPE concentration (1.5%) led to increased total and 
reactive sulfhydryl content, along with a significant decrease in carbonyl 
content, peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, p-anisidine, 
and totox values at the end of the storage period (p < 0.05). Additionally, 
NP-ALG-LPE coated shrimp samples exhibited an excellent antimicrobial property 
and significantly inhibited the growth of total viable count, lactic acid 
bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and psychotropic bacteria during storage. These 
results suggested that NP-ALG-LPE 1.5% coatings effectively maintained the 
quality as well as extended the shelf-life of shrimp during 14 days of 
refrigerated storage. Therefore, the use of nanoparticle-based LPE edible 
coating could be a new and effective way to maintain the quality of shrimp 
during prolonged storage.

Influential existing research has suggested that rather than being static, 
mortality declines decelerate at young ages and accelerate at old ages. Without 
accounting for this feature, the forecast mortality rates of the popular 
Lee-Carter (LC) model are less reliable in the long run. To provide more 
accurate mortality forecasting, we introduce a time-varying coefficients 
extension of the LC model by adopting the effective kernel methods. With two 
frequently used kernel functions, Epanechnikov (LC-E) and Gaussian (LC-G), we 
demonstrate that the proposed extension is easy to implement, incorporates the 
rotating patterns of mortality decline and is straightforwardly extensible to 
multi-population cases. Using a large sample of 15 countries over 1950-2019, we 
show that LC-E and LC-G, as well as their multi-population counterparts, can 
consistently improve the forecasting accuracy of the competing LC and Li-Lee 
models in both single- and multi-population scenarios.

In Sweden, physical activity on prescription (PAP) is used to support patients 
in increasing their levels of physical activity (PA). The role of healthcare 
professionals in supporting PA behavior change requires optimization in terms of 
knowledge, quality and organization. This study aims to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of support from a physiotherapist (PT) compared to continued 
PAP at a healthcare center (HCC) for patients who remained insufficiently active 
after 6-month PAP treatment at the HCC. The PT strategy was constituted by a 
higher follow-up frequency as well as by aerobic physical fitness tests. The 
analysis was based on an RCT with a three-year time horizon, including 190 
patients aged 27-77 with metabolic risk factors. The cost per QALY for the PT 
strategy compared to the HCC strategy was USD 16,771 with a societal perspective 
(including individual PA expenses, production loss and time cost for exercise, 
as well as healthcare resource use) and USD 33,450 with a healthcare perspective 
(including only costs related to healthcare resource use). Assuming a 
willingness-to-pay of USD 57,000 for a QALY, the probability of 
cost-effectiveness for the PT strategy was 0.5 for the societal perspective and 
0.6 for the healthcare perspective. Subgroup analyses on cost-effectiveness 
based on individual characteristics regarding enjoyment, expectations and 
confidence indicated potential in identifying cost-effective strategies based on 
mediating factors. However, this needs to be further explored. In conclusion, 
both PT and HCC interventions are similar from a cost-effectiveness perspective, 
indicating that both strategies are equally valuable in healthcare's range of 
treatments.

This study examines the effects of health expenditure, energy consumption, CO2 
emissions, population size, and income on health outcomes in 46 Asian nations 
between 1997 and 2019. Cross-sectional dependence (CSD) and slope heterogeneity 
(SH) tests are utilized due to the close linkages between Asian nations as a 
result of commerce, tourism, religion, and international agreements. The 
research uses unit root and cointegration tests of the second generation after 
validating CSD and SH issues. Due to the results of the CSD and SH tests, it is 
clear that conventional methods of estimation are inappropriate, so a new panel 
method, the inter autoregressive distributive lag (CS-ARDL) model, is used 
instead. In addition to CS-ARDL, the study's results were checked with a common 
correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) method and an augmented mean group (AMG) 
method. According to the CS-ARDL study, higher rates of energy use and 
healthcare spending lead to better health outcomes for Asian countries over the 
long run. CO2 emissions are shown to be harmful to human health, according to 
the study. The influence of a population's size on health outcomes is shown to 
be negative in the CS-ARDL and CCEMG, but favorable in the AMG. Only the AMG 
coefficient is significant. In most instances, the results of the AMG and CCEMG 
corroborate the results of the CS-ARDL. Among all the factors influencing life 
expectancy in Asian countries, healthcare spending is the most influential. 
Hence, to improve health outcomes, Asian countries need to take the required 
actions to boost health spending, energy consumption, and long-term economic 
growth. To achieve the best possible health outcomes, Asian countries should 
also reduce their CO2 emissions.

Public health is funded with government funds gathered from tax revenues, 
whether national, provincial or municipal. The health system therefore suffers 
during economic crisis periods, whether due to disinvestment, loss of purchasing 
power among health care personnel or the decrease in the number of 
professionals. This worsens the situation, as it is necessary to cover the needs 
of an increasingly elderly population and with a longer life expectancy at 
birth. The present study intends to show a model which explains the 
determination of the "Public Health Personnel Expenditure" in Spain for a 
determined period. A multiple linear regression model was applied to the period 
including the years 1980-2021. Macroeconomic and demographic variables were 
analyzed to explain the dependent variable. Variation in health personnel 
expenditure: "We included those variables which presented a high or very high 
correlation above r > 0.6. The variables which explain the behavior of Variation 
in health personnel expenditure". It was a determining factor in the present 
study to consider that the variables with the greatest repercussions on health 
policy were mainly macroeconomic variables rather than demographic variables, 
with the only significant demographic variable that had a specific weight lower 
than macroeconomic variables being "Birth Rate". In this sense, the contribution 
made to the scientific literature is to establish an explanatory model so that 
public policy managers and states in particular can consider it in their public 
spending policies, bearing in mind that health expenditures in a Beveridge-style 
health system, as Spain has, are paid with funds drawn from tax revenues.

Road safety is increasingly threatened by distracted driving. Studies have shown 
that there is a significantly increased risk for a driver of being involved in a 
car crash due to visual distractions (not watching the road), manual 
distractions (hands are off the wheel for other non-driving activities), and 
cognitive and acoustic distractions (the driver is not focused on the driving 
task). Driving simulators (DSs) are powerful tools for identifying drivers' 
responses to different distracting factors in a safe manner. This paper aims to 
systematically review simulator-based studies to investigate what types of 
distractions are introduced when using the phone for texting while driving 
(TWD), what hardware and measures are used to analyze distraction, and what the 
impact of using mobile devices to read and write messages while driving is on 
driving performance. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
guidelines. A total of 7151 studies were identified in the database search, of 
which 67 were included in the review, and they were analyzed in order to respond 
to four research questions. The main findings revealed that TWD distraction has 
negative effects on driving performance, affecting drivers' divided attention 
and concentration, which can lead to potentially life-threatening traffic 
events. We also provide several recommendations for driving simulators that can 
ensure high reliability and validity for experiments. This review can serve as a 
basis for regulators and interested parties to propose restrictions related to 
using mobile phones in a vehicle and improve road safety.
