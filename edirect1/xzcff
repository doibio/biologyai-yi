The objective was to estimate the burden of osteoporosis in Sweden based on 
current clinical practice and the cost-effectiveness of improvements in the 
management of osteoporosis over the clinical management compared to current 
clinical practice. Results showed that better compliance to treatment guidelines 
is associated with better projected outcomes and cost-savings.
INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to estimate the burden of 
osteoporosis in Sweden based on current clinical practice and the 
cost-effectiveness of improvements in the management of osteoporosis over the 
clinical management compared to current clinical practice.
METHODS: The analysis was carried out using a model that simulates the 
individual patients considered for pharmacological treatment during 1 year and 
their projected osteoporosis treatment pathway, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and costs over their remaining lifetime. All patients regardless of 
treatment or no treatment were simulated. Information on current management of 
osteoporosis in terms of patient characteristics and treatment patterns were 
derived from a Swedish osteoporosis research database based on national 
registers and patient records. Current (standard) clinical management was 
compared with alternative scenarios mirroring Swedish treatment guidelines.
RESULTS: The national burden in terms of lost QALYs was estimated at 14,993 
QALYs and the total economic cost at €776M. Scenario analyses showed that 
382-3864 QALYs could be gained at a cost/QALY ranging from cost-saving to 
€31368, depending on the scenario. The margin of investment, i.e. the maximum 
amount that could be invested in the healthcare system to achieve these 
improvements up to the limit of the willingness to pay/QALY, was estimated at 
€199M on a population level (€3,634/patient).
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed that better compliance to treatment guidelines 
is associated with better projected outcomes and cost-savings. From a 
cost-effectiveness perspective, there is also considerable room for investment 
to achieve these improvements in the management of osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND: Untreated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and 
adolescents is associated with a considerable economic burden on the health 
system, families and society. Recent research has demonstrated the potential 
efficacy of cognitive therapy as an early intervention for PTSD in children and 
adolescents. Children who experienced a single traumatic event in the previous 
two to six months and were randomized to cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) 
were significantly more likely to be PTSD-free compared to those randomized to 
usual care represented by waitlist control. The current study evaluated the 
economic impact of improvements in the treatment of PTSD in children and 
adolescents.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the national health 
service/personal social services perspective with outcomes expressed as 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Patient level costs and outcomes were 
collected during the 11 week clinical trial and extrapolated to a three year 
time horizon using economic modelling methods. Uncertainty was estimated using 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis and assumptions were tested using one way 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 3 years was £2,205 per QALY 
with a 60%-69% probability of CT-PTSD being cost-effective compared to usual 
care at the UK £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY decision threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence for the cost-effectiveness 
of cognitive therapy in this treatment population. Larger pragmatic trials with 
longer follow-up are indicated.

Initiating breastfeeding within the first hour of life confers an important 
benefit in terms of child mortality and severe morbidity. Intestinal 
permeability to ingested macromolecules and immunoglobulins is limited to the 
first days of human life. These exchanges cease in the very early post-partum 
period but may increase beyond the neonatal period in response to local 
inflammation or introduction of a weaning food. From animal- and limited 
human-based observations, compelling evidence points out to breastmilk cells 
also trafficking from mother to infant mucosal tissues and participating to the 
maternal microchimerism. The precise nature of breastmilk cells that are 
involved is presently not known but likely includes progenitor/stem 
cells-representing up to 6% of breastmilk cells-with possible contribution of 
mature immune cells. Stem cell microchimerism may induce tolerance to 
non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMAs), breastfeeding generating regulatory T 
cells (Treg ) that suppress antimaternal immunity. Therefore, in complement to 
pregnancy-induced microchimerism, breastfeeding-induced microchimerism may be 
pivotal in infant immune development, intestinal tissue repair/growth and 
protection against infectious diseases. As a continuum of the gestational 
period, the neonatal gut may be considered as a temporary, but important 
developmental extension of the role played by the placenta during intrauterine 
life; breastmilk playing the role of maternal blood by delivering maternal 
soluble factors (macromolecules, Ig, cytokines) and immunologically active milk 
cells. A better understanding of breastfeeding-induced maternal microchimerism 
would provide further evidence in support of public health messages that 
reinforce the importance of early initiation of breastfeeding.

Despite the call by the scientific community for a systematic monitoring of 
physical health in people with psychiatric illnesses, national and international 
audits have reported poor quality of cardiovascular risk assessments and 
management in this vulnerable population. Available evidence indicates that in 
people affected by mental illness, life expectancy is reduced by 10-20 years, 
mainly due to cardiovascular accidents and metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related 
diseases. The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of 
cardiovascular risk monitoring in an outpatient sample of patients taking 
second-generation antipsychotics. The sample consisted of 200 patients 
consecutively recruited from two community mental health centres. A clinical 
chart review was performed on the following laboratory tests: total cholesterol, 
high- and low-density lipoprotein, serum triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, 
γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Blood pressure and waist circumference were measured. 
A complete cardiovascular risk assessment was available only in 60 patients out 
of 200 (33.3%). The only variable associated with laboratory tests for MetS was 
receiving three or more psychotropic medications, which increased fourfold the 
probability of metabolic screening. In the subsample of patients with full 
screening, the prevalence of MetS was 33.3%. Our findings suggest that mental 
health professionals working in community mental health services should 
incorporate a more systematic assessment of physical health in their practice, 
and intervene proactively to reduce the significant cardiovascular burden 
carried by people with several mental illness.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressively neurodegenerative disease with 
typical hallmarks of amyloid β (Aβ) plaque accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle 
(NFT) formation and neuronal death extension. Aggressive Aβ accumulation 
promotes senile plaque formation and perturbs endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
function to trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to neuronal 
apoptosis. The stress-dependent activation of protein kinase RNA-like 
endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) increases the phosphorylation of eukaryotic 
translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) to promote the preferential synthesis 
of β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Aβ generation in turn. Additionally, 
dysfunction in autophagy has been reported to contribute to several 
neurodegenerative diseases including AD, and impairment in autophagy-mediated 
pathway may constitutively stimulate the generation of Aβ in AD. Here we 
discovered that protopanaxadiol derivative 
1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-3-(3-dehydroxyl-20(s)-protopanaxadiol-3β-yl)-urea 
(DDPU) effectively improved the activity of daily living (ADL) and cognitive 
deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The crosstalk between Aβ and ER stress has 
been intensively investigated by using DDPU as a probe. DDPU reduced Aβ 
production mainly by inhibiting the PERK/eIF2α signaling-mediated BACE1 
translation and stimulated Aβ clearance by promoting autophagy as a PI3K 
inhibitor through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, while exhibited 
neuroprotective effect involving attenuation of ER stress. DDPU might be the 
first reported ginsenoside derivative with dual effects on both autophagy 
promotion and ER stress amelioration. Our results have highlighted the potential 
of DDPU in the treatment of AD.

Children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) need new and more 
efficient treatments. They can be developed at relapse or at diagnosis, but 
therefore they must be combined with radiotherapy. Survival of children after 
recurrence and its predictors were studied to inform the possibility to design 
early phase clinical trials for DIPG at this stage. Among 142 DIPG patients 
treated between 1998 and 2014, 114 had biopsy-proven DIPG with histone H3 status 
available for 83. We defined as long survivors' patients who survived more than 
3 months after relapse which corresponds to the minimal life expectancy 
requested for phase I/II trials. Factors influencing post-relapse survival were 
accordingly compared between short and long-term survivors after relapse. 
Fifty-seven percent of patients were considered long survivors and 70% of them 
had a Lansky Play Scale (LPS) above 50% at relapse. Patients who became 
steroids-independent after initial treatment for at least 2 months had better 
survival after relapse (3.7 versus 2.6 months, p = 0.001). LPS above 50% at 
relapse was correlated with better survival after relapse (3.8 versus 
1.8 months, p < 0.001). Patients with H3.1 mutation survived longer after 
relapse (4.9 versus 2.7 months, p = 0.007). Patients who received a second 
radiotherapy at the time of relapse had an improved survival (7.5 versus 
4 months, p = 0.001). In the two-way ANOVA analysis, steroid-independence and 
LPS predicted survival best and the type of histone H3 (H3.1 or H3.3) mutated 
did not improve prediction. Survival of many DIPG patients after relapse over 
3 months would make possible to propose specific trials for this condition. 
Steroid-independence, H3 mutation status and LPS should be considered to predict 
eligibility.

Immunohistochemical investigation of P16, P53 and Ki-67's prognostic values in 
diffuse large B-Cell lymphomas.

Baran M, Canoz O, Altuntas H, Sivgin S, Cetin M, Yay A, Ketenci S.

AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the immunohistochemical properties of 
Ki-67, P53 expression and loss of P16, and to assess their relationship with 
both clinical parameters and patient survival in DLBCL.
METHOD: Forty patients, diagnosed at the Pathology Department of our institute 
with nodal DLBCL were selected as the study group. The relationship between P16, 
P53, Ki-67 expressions and clinical and laboratory parameters like age, gender, 
performance status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), clinical stage, 
presence of B-symptoms, bone marrow involvement, International Prognostic Index 
(IPI) score, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, extranodal extension, relapse, 
C-reactive protein (CRP), sedimentation, number of leukocytes in patients and 
patient survival were then statistically evaluated.
RESULTS: Our results display no statistically significant correlation between 
P53 expression and loss of P16, Ki-67 proliferation index and clinical 
parameters and overall survival (p > 0.05). The only statistically significant 
relationship was between loss of P16 and stage (p 0.05).
CONCLUSION: According to the results of our study, the loss of P16, P53 gene 
expression and Ki-67 proliferation index have no effect on life expectancy of 
patients with DLBCL (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 29).

Relatively poor results have been reported with open reduction and internal 
fixation of complex fractures around the knee in elderly osteoporotic patients, 
and primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been proposed as an alternative 
solution. While limiting the number of procedures, it meets two prerequisites: 
(1) to save the patient's life, thanks to early weight-bearing, to limit 
decubitus complications; and (2) to save knee function and patient autonomy, 
thanks to early knee mobilization. There are 3 main indications: complex 
articular fractures in elderly patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis prior to 
fracture; complex articular fractures of the tibial plateau in elderly patients 
whose bone quality makes internal fixation hazardous; and major destruction of 
the distal femur in younger patients. Although admitted in emergency, these 
patients require adequate preoperative management, including a multidisciplinary 
approach to manage comorbidities, control of anemia and pain, and assessment and 
management of vascular and cutaneous conditions. Preoperative planning is 
crucial, to order appropriate implants and materials that may be needed 
intraoperatively. Surgical technique is based on the basic principles of 
revision surgery as regards choice of implant, steps of reconstruction, bone 
defect management and implant fixation. For complex fractures of the distal 
femur, primary temporary reduction is a useful "trick", to determine the level 
of the joint line and femoral rotation. Complementary internal fixation may be 
required in case of diaphyseal extension of the fracture and to prevent 
inter-prosthetic fractures. In the literature, the results of primary TKA for 
fracture are encouraging and better than for secondary TKA after failure of 
non-operative treatment or internal fixation, with lower rates of revision and 
complications, earlier full weight-bearing and better functional results. Loss 
of autonomy is, however, frequent, and 1-year mortality is high, especially 
following complex femoral fractures in the elderly.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of policy, systems and environmental 
factors with improvement in household food security among low-income Indiana 
households with children after a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) direct nutrition education intervention.
DESIGN: Household food security scores measured by the eighteen-item US 
Household Food Security Survey Module in a longitudinal randomized and 
controlled SNAP-Ed intervention study conducted from August 2013 to April 2015 
were the response variable. Metrics to quantify environmental factors including 
classification of urban or rural county status; the number of SNAP-authorized 
stores, food pantries and recreational facilities; average fair market housing 
rental price; and natural amenity rank were collected from government websites 
and data sets covering the years 2012-2016 and used as covariates in mixed 
multiple linear regression modelling.
SETTING: Thirty-seven Indiana counties, USA, 2012-2016.
SUBJECTS: SNAP-Ed eligible adults from households with children (n 328).
RESULTS: None of the environmental factors investigated were significantly 
associated with changes in household food security in this exploratory study.
CONCLUSIONS: SNAP-Ed improves food security regardless of urban or rural 
location or the environmental factors investigated. Expansion of SNAP-Ed in 
rural areas may support food access among the low-income population and reduce 
the prevalence of food insecurity in rural compared with urban areas. Further 
investigation into policy, systems and environmental factors of the Social 
Ecological Model are warranted to better understand their relationship with 
direct SNAP-Ed and their impact on diet-related behaviours and food security.

BACKGROUND: Maintenance treatment of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) without disease progression after first-line chemotherapy is a 
subject of ongoing research. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR)-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, i.e., gefitinib in the maintenance setting 
irrespective of EGFR status.
METHODS: Patients aged 18 years or older of Indian origin, who had a life 
expectancy of >12 weeks with histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage IV 
NSCLC, the WHO performance status of 0-2, and who had completed four to six 
cycles of first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy without disease 
progression or unacceptable toxic effects were included in the study. The 
primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival in the 
intention-to-treat population.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a median age of 55 years (40-68) were 
included in the study. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for the entire 
group was 8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.45-14.54) had not reached 
for EGFR-positive patient, but in the EGFR negative cohort, the PFS was 4.98 
months (hazard ratio = 0.092, 95% CI = 3.4-6.5, P = 0.01). The median overall 
survival (OS) of the study group was 15 months (95% CI = 3.7-26.4), all patients 
with EGFR positive were alive (100% survival). The median OS for EGFR negative 
group was about 6.3 months. The major toxicity observed was rash/acne in 15 
patients, pruritus in 7 patients, and one patient had Grade 4 pneumonitis.
CONCLUSION: Gefitinib maintenance is safe, well-tolerated therapy, produces 
significant PFS and OS benefit in EGFR mutation-positive patient. It is 
definitely not a choice for EGFR negative group. In EGFR unknown group, the role 
of maintenance still needs to be explored.

Introduction Juvenile hemochromatosis is a rare but severe form of hereditary 
hemochromatosis that typically presents early in life and can be fatal if left 
untreated. Case presentation We present the case of a 30-year-old man with a 
clear symptomatology of juvenile hemochromatosis, but in whom the diagnosis was 
initially mistaken for alcoholic liver disease because of known excessive use of 
alcohol, with the consequence that an adequate treatment was postponed. 
Discussion In this report, we discuss the diagnosis and treatment of juvenile 
hemochromatosis, focusing on the interaction between hemochromatosis and alcohol 
induced liver disease and how to differentiate both. We conclude that every 
young patient with suspected alcoholic liver disease and signs of iron overload 
should have a testing to rule out other iron overloading pathology, since early 
recognition and treatment with phlebotomy may prevent organ damage and improve 
life expectancy.

Meditope, a cyclic 12-residue peptide, binds to a unique binding side between 
the light and heavy chains of the cetuximab Fab. In an effort to improve the 
affinity of the interaction, it was sought to extend the side chain of Arg8 in 
the meditope, a residue that is accessible from the other side of the meditope 
binding site, in order to increase the number of interactions. These 
modifications included an n-butyl and n-octyl extension as well as hydroxyl, 
amine and carboxyl substitutions. The atomic structures of the complexes and the 
binding kinetics for each modified meditope indicated that each extension 
threaded through the Fab `hole' and that the carboxyethylarginine substitution 
makes a favorable interaction with the Fab, increasing the half-life of the 
complex by threefold compared with the unmodified meditope. Taken together, 
these studies provide a basis for the design of additional modifications to 
enhance the overall affinity of this unique interaction.

Health Services, and Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel-Aviv University , Israel.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of life expectancy (LE) post traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
is important for planning services for patients and for dealing with 
medico-legal aspects. We hypothesized that LE for patients who survived 2 years 
post injury is equal to that of the general population (GP).
METHODS: A cohort of 279 patients was assembled during a 5-year period and was 
followed for 22-27 years. During follow-up, 32 patients (11.5%) died, creating a 
huge censored data (88.5%). Analyses included standard mortality ratio (SMR), 
Kaplan-Meier method (KM), Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (PH) and 
calculations of life expectancy.
RESULTS: About 77% of the patients were under 35 years of age at injury. This 
age cut-off point yielded differences for survival longevity by χ2 tests 
(p < 0.0001), by KM analysis (p < 0.0001) and by Cox PH regression analysis 
(p < 0.0001, HR = 13.95). SMR for the entire cohort was 1.86. Shortening of LE 
in comparison with the GP is 3.58 years. Estimated shortening of LE by severity 
for mild, moderate and severe injury were -0.51, 4.11 and 13.77 years, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mild TBI have a LE similar to the GP, and a reduction 
in LE was closely related to moderate and severe brain injury.

Retinal Prosthesis System for Advanced Retinitis Pigmentosa: A Health Technology 
Assessment Update.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Lee C, Tu HA, Wells D, Holubowich C.

BACKGROUND: Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of inherited disorders characterized 
by the degeneration of the photoreceptors in the retina, resulting in 
progressive vision loss. The Argus II system is designed to restore partial 
functional vision in patients with profound vision loss from advanced retinitis 
pigmentosa. At present, it is the only treatment option approved by Health 
Canada for this patient population. In June 2016, Health Quality Ontario 
published a health technology assessment of the Argus II retinal prosthesis 
system for patients with advanced retinitis pigmentosa. Based on that 
assessment, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee recommended against 
publicly funding the Argus II system for this population. It also recommended 
that Health Quality Ontario re-evaluate the evidence in 1 year. The objective of 
this report was to examine new evidence published since the 2016 health 
technology assessment.
METHODS: We completed a health technology assessment, which included an 
evaluation of clinical benefits and harms, value for money, and patient 
preferences related to the Argus II system. We performed a systematic literature 
search for studies published since the 2016 Argus II health technology 
assessment. We developed a Markov decision-analytic model to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of the Argus II system compared with standard care, and we 
calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over a 20-year time horizon. We 
also conducted a five-year budget impact analysis. Finally, we interviewed 
people with retinitis pigmentosa about their lived experience with vision loss, 
and with the Argus II system.
RESULTS: Four publications from one multicentre international study were 
included in the clinical review. Patients showed significant improvements in 
visual function and functional outcomes with the Argus II system, and these 
outcomes were sustained up to a 5-year follow-up (moderate quality of evidence). 
The safety profile was generally acceptable.In the base case economic analysis, 
the Argus II system was cost-effective compared with standard care if the 
willingness to pay was more than $97,429 per quality-adjusted life-year. We 
estimated that funding the Argus II system would cost the province $0.71 to 
$0.78 million per year over 5 years, assuming 4 implants per year.People with 
lived experience spoke about the challenges of retinitis pigmentosa, including 
the gradual but persistent progression of the disease; its impact on their 
quality of life and their families; and the accessibility challenges they faced. 
Those who used the Argus II system spoke about its positive impact on their 
quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence of moderate quality, the Argus II retinal 
prosthesis system improved visual function, real-life functional outcomes, and 
quality of life in patients with advanced retinitis pigmentosa. The Argus II 
system is expensive, but the cost to publicly fund it would be low, because of 
the small number of eligible patients. The Argus II system can only enable 
perception of light/dark and shapes/objects, but these advancements represent 
important gains for people with retinitis pigmentosa in terms of mobility and 
quality of life.

Ginger is a perennial monocotyledonous herb, which can be used as both a 
vegetable and a medicinal plant. However, it is susceptible to various plant 
pathogens. Microbial diversity in soil is related closely to the health and 
productivity of plant crops including ginger. In the current study, we compared 
microbial diversity from soil samples under ginger cultivation (disease 
incidence of >50% [relatively unhealthy sample] versus disease incidence of <10% 
[relatively healthy sample]). The bacterial and fungal taxa were analyzed by 
Illumina-based sequencing, with 16S and ITS identification, respectively. Both 
bacterial and fungal OTUs were significantly more in the healthy soil sample 
than the unhealthy sample. Moreover, the dominant bacterial and fungal genera 
were detected to be different in each sample. Rhodanobacter and Kaistobacter 
were the dominant bacterial genera in the healthy sample, while Rhodoplanes and 
Bradyrhizobium were the dominant genera in the unhealthy sample. For fungal 
analysis, Cladosporium, Cryptococcus, and Tetracladium were the dominant genera 
in the healthy sample, while Lecanicillium, Pochonia, and Rhodotorula were the 
dominant genera in the unhealthy sample. Collectively, the basic information of 
microbial diversity in ginger soil is helpful for elucidating the ginger-microbe 
interactions and potentially selecting suitable plant growth-promoting 
rhizobacteria and biocontrol agents for ginger production.

The liver is the most common site of metastasis in patients with colorectal 
cancer due to its anatomical situation regarding its portal circulation. About 
14 to 18% of patients with colorectal cancer present metastasis at the first 
medical consultation, and 10 to 25% at the time of the resection of the primary 
colorectal cancer. The incidence is higher (35%) when a computed tomography (CT) 
scan is used. In the last decades, a significant increase in the life expectancy 
of patients with colorectal cancer has been achieved with different diagnostic 
and treatment programs. Despite these improvements, the presence of metastasis, 
disease recurrence, and advanced local tumors continue to remain poor prognostic 
factors. Median survival without treatment is <8 months from the moment of its 
presentation, and a survival rate at 5 years of 11% is the best prognosis for 
those who present with local metastasis. Even in patients with limited 
metastatic disease, 5-year survival is exceptional. Patients with hepatic 
metastasis of colorectal cancer have a median survival of 5 to 20 months with no 
treatment. Approximately 20 to 30% of patients with colorectal metastasis have 
disease confined to the liver, and this can be managed with surgery. Modern 
surgical strategies at the main hepatobiliary centers have proved that 
hepatectomy of 70% of the liver can be performed, with a mortality rate of <5%. 
It is very important to have knowledge of predisposing factors, diagnostic 
methods, and treatment of hepatic metastasis. However, the establishment of 
newer, efficient, preventive screening programs for early diagnosis and adequate 
treatment is vital. How to cite this article: Valderrama-Treviño AI,

BACKGROUND: Back pain and musculoskeletal conditions negatively affect the 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) of employees and generate substantial 
costs to employers.
AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of yoga for managing musculoskeletal 
conditions.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial evaluated an 8-week yoga programme, with 
a 6-month follow-up, for National Health Service (NHS) employees. Effectiveness 
in managing musculoskeletal conditions was assessed using repeated-measures 
generalized linear modelling for the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire 
(RDQ) and the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool. Cost-effectiveness was determined 
using area-under-the-curve linear regression for assessing HRQL from healthcare 
and societal perspectives. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) was also calculated. Sickness absence was measured using electronic staff 
records at 6 months.
RESULTS: There were 151 participants. At 6 months, mean differences between 
groups favouring yoga were observed for RDQ [-0.63 (95% CI, -1.78, 0.48)], Keele 
STarT [-0.28 (95% CI, -0.97, 0.07)] and HRQL (0.016 QALY gain). From a 
healthcare perspective, yoga yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
£2103 per QALY. Given a willingness to pay for an additional QALY of £20 000, 
the probability of yoga being cost-effective was 95%. From a societal 
perspective, yoga was the dominant treatment compared with usual care. At 6 
months, electronic staff records showed that yoga participants missed a total of 
2 working days due to musculoskeletal conditions compared with 43 days for usual 
care participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Yoga for NHS employees may enhance HRQL, reduce disability 
associated with back pain, lower sickness absence due to musculoskeletal 
conditions and is likely to be cost-effective.

A palpable mass in the musculoskeletal system is a common reason for 
consultation. The main issue is that a malignant tumor must not be missed. 
Inappropriate initial treatment can have direct consequences on the risk of 
local recurrence, the patient's future function and life expectancy. A mass more 
than 5cm in diameter, a subfascial location and a recent increase in size are 
signs that should lead the physician to question whether the lesion is truly 
benign and to carry out diagnostic examinations. MRI is the gold standard 
imaging exam. Biopsy, which is now mainly percutaneous and imaging-guided, must 
be performed for any subfascial mass more than 5cm long or a smaller mass with a 
high risk of postoperative functional sequelae. Referring the patient to a 
specialized cancer center has direct benefits on the patient's recurrence-free 
survival and reduces time lost during the diagnostic and treatment phases. For 
malignant tumors, surgical treatment requires resection margins that comply with 
cancer guidelines. Preservation of the limb and its function may require 
multidisciplinary reconstruction techniques. Pre- or post-operative radiation 
therapy or chemotherapy should be proposed only after discussion in a 
multidisciplinary team meeting.

INTRODUCTION: Sweden has amongst the highest incidence rates of type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) in Europe. The high incidence and chronic nature of T1D result in high 
prevalence and economic burden. Improving glycemic control reduces the incidence 
of microvascular complications, which in turn reduces medical costs. The present 
study aimed to quantify the reductions in cost and improvements in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy with varying reductions in HbA1c in the T1D 
population.
METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate a typical Swedish 
population of patients with T1D experiencing HbA1c reductions from 0.1% to 0.8% 
(in 0.1% increments) from 7.9% at baseline. Analyses were conducted in simulated 
cohorts based on data from the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) and in 
subgroups by sex, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI), with different sets 
of quality-of-life utilities included. Generalized least squares (GLS) models 
were used to test for significant differences between subgroups. Analyses were 
also performed to investigate the effect of the duration of HbA1c control. 
Analyses were run over 50 years and outcomes discounted at 3% per annum.
RESULTS: In the reference case analysis, reducing HbA1c lowered the incidence of 
microvascular and macrovascular complications and improved quality-adjusted life 
expectancy. GLS models identified a significantly larger benefit of reducing 
HbA1c in women over men, but found no significant differences in the magnitude 
of quality of life improvements with decreasing HbA1c when segregating by 
smoking status or BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing HbA1c in a population with T1D would reduce the incidence 
of microvascular complications, improve life expectancy and quality of life. 
Larger quality-of-life benefits were observed in younger and female adult 
patients, but no notable differences were observed in the benefits of glycemic 
control in smokers versus non-smokers or in patients with low or high BMI.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate preoperative staging helps avert morbidity, 
mortality, and cost associated with non-therapeutic laparotomy in gastric cancer 
(GC) patients. Diagnostic staging laparoscopy (DSL) can detect metastases with 
high sensitivity, but its cost-effectiveness has not been previously studied. We 
developed a decision analysis model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
preoperative DSL in GC workup.
METHODS: Analysis was based on a hypothetical cohort of GC patients in the U.S. 
for whom initial imaging shows no metastases. The cost-effectiveness of DSL was 
measured as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Drivers of 
cost-effectiveness were assessed in sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Preoperative DSL required an investment of $107 012 per QALY. In 
sensitivity analysis, DSL became cost-effective at a threshold of $100 000/QALY 
when the probability of occult metastases exceeded 31.5% or when test 
sensitivity for metastases exceeded 86.3%. The likelihood of cost-effectiveness 
increased from 46% to 93% when both parameters were set at maximum reported 
values.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of DSL for GC patients is highly dependent 
on patient and test characteristics, and is more likely when DSL is used 
selectively where procedure yield is high, such as for locally advanced disease 
or in detecting peritoneal and superficial versus deep liver lesions.
