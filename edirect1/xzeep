Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition with a rising prevalence in 
the elderly population, possibly as a consequence of the increasing population 
life expectancy. Untreated aortic dissection can lead to myocardial infarction, 
aortic branch malperfusion or occlusion, rupture, aneurysm formation and death. 
This study aims to assess the potential of a biomechanical model in predicting 
the risks of a non-dilated thoracic aorta with Stanford type A dissection. To 
achieve this, a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction model was developed 
under realistic blood flow conditions. This model of the aorta was developed by 
considering three-dimensional artery geometry, multiple artery layers, 
hyperelastic artery wall, in vivo-based physiological time-varying blood 
velocity profiles, and non-Newtonian blood behaviours. The results demonstrate 
that in a thoracic aorta with Stanford type A dissection, the wall shear stress 
(WSS) is significantly low in the ascending aorta and false lumen, leading to 
potential aortic dilation and thrombus formation. The results also reveal that 
the WSS is highly related to blood flow patterns. The aortic arch region near 
the brachiocephalic and left common carotid artery is prone to rupture, showing 
a good agreement with the clinical reports. The results have been translated 
into their potential clinical relevance by revealing the role of the stress 
state, WSS and flow characteristics as the main parameters affecting lesion 
progression, including rupture and aneurysm. The developed model can be tailored 
for patient-specific studies and utilised as a predictive tool to estimate 
aneurysm growth and initiation of wall rupture inside the human thoracic aorta.

Poverty is an important social determinant of health that is associated with 
increased risk of death1-5. Cash transfer programmes provide non-contributory 
monetary transfers to individuals or households, with or without behavioural 
conditions such as children's school attendance6,7. Over recent decades, cash 
transfer programmes have emerged as central components of poverty reduction 
strategies of many governments in low- and middle-income countries6,7. The 
effects of these programmes on adult and child mortality rates remains an 
important gap in the literature, however, with existing evidence limited to a 
few specific conditional cash transfer programmes, primarily in Latin 
America8-14. Here we evaluated the effects of large-scale, government-led cash 
transfer programmes on all-cause adult and child mortality using 
individual-level longitudinal mortality datasets from many low- and 
middle-income countries. We found that cash transfer programmes were associated 
with significant reductions in mortality among children under five years of age 
and women. Secondary heterogeneity analyses suggested similar effects for 
conditional and unconditional programmes, and larger effects for programmes that 
covered a larger share of the population and provided larger transfer amounts, 
and in countries with lower health expenditures, lower baseline life expectancy, 
and higher perceived regulatory quality. Our findings support the use of 
anti-poverty programmes such as cash transfers, which many countries have 
introduced or expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, to improve population 
health.

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders are one of the main causes of 
disability among adults globally. The burden of MSK disorders varies greatly 
between different regions and is the highest in low- and middle income- 
countries. This study sought to investigate trends in the burden of MSK 
disorders across the MENA region, utilizing the GBD 2019 dataset.
METHODS: This ecological study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) to report on the burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders in The Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) region between 1990 and 2019. Our analysis involved 
descriptive statistics and sociodemographic trends and did not employ any 
specific statistical analyses. Using age-standardized rates of prevalence and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we reported trends in the burden of MSK 
disorders, as well as national variation between different countries. 
Furthermore, we analyzed trends in risk factors contributing to MSK disorders by 
age and gender.
RESULTS: The longitudinal analysis from 1990 to 2019 showed an increase in the 
age-standardized rate for prevalence and DALYs of MSK disorders by 5% and 4.80%, 
respectively. Low back pain continued to be the most prevalent MSK condition, 
while RA and other MSK disorders had the largest percentage increase for DALYs 
between 1990 and 2019. The study found that Afghanistan had the lowest age 
standardized DALYs rate attributed to MSK disorders, while Iran, Turkey, and 
Jordan had the highest. Further, Syria showed the most dramatic decrease while 
Saudi Arabia had the most notable increase in age standardized DALY rates from 
1990 to 2019. In 2019, occupational risks, high body mass index, and tobacco 
smoking were the main risk factors for MSK disorders, with occupational risks 
being the largest contributor, and between 1990 and 2019, there was a decrease 
in the contribution of occupational risks but an increase in the contribution of 
high body mass index as a risk factor.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the significant burden of MSK disorders in the 
MENA region, with various risk factors contributing to its increasing prevalence 
in recent decades. Further research is needed to better understand the 
underlying factors and potential interventions that could improve health 
outcomes. Addressing MSK disorders should be a public health priority in the 
region, and efforts should be made to develop effective strategies to prevent 
and manage this debilitating condition.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is the second highest cause of morbidity among 
malignant tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and fifth in overall cancer 
statistics. Diseases of the cardiovascular system are the leading causes of 
death in the world. Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is the most common type of 
vascular aneurysm, while in 75% of the cases it is asymptomatic. The risk of 
rupture of aneurysm of the abdominal aorta increases progressively depending on 
its diameter and the age of the patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male patient underwent treatment for complaints 
of pain and discomfort in the epigastric region, general weakness and difficulty 
in passing food through the esophagus. The neoplasm extended to the esophagus up 
to 17-20 mm (pT3N3aM0 R0 stage IIIB TNM 8). The aortic diameter at the level of 
the renal arteries was 18 mm; lower than the main renal arteries, an expansion 
of up to 60 mm was visualized; the length of aneurysm was 105 mm extending to 
the bifurcation. A gastrectomy with a resection of the lower thoracic esophagus 
and application of a manual double-row Roux-en -Y esophagojejunal anastomosis 
with cholecystectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy was done along with longitudinal 
aneurysmectomy and thrombectomy. The proximal anastomosis between the aorta and 
the synthetic linear prosthesis of 18 × 9 × 9 mm in the end-to-end type was 
formed by a continuous winding suture with the "Prolene" 5-0 thread. The 
end-to-end distal anastomosis of the prosthesis and aorta branch was formed by 
continuous winding suture with the "Prolene" 6-0 thread. The postoperative 
period proceeded without features and complications. On the 7th day after the 
surgery, the patient was discharged home in satisfactory condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing a simultaneous operation allowed the patient to undergo 
rehabilitation after the treatment of two diseases during one hospitalization 
and, in the shortest possible time, to proceed to the next stage of gastric 
cancer treatment-chemotherapy, thereby improving the prognosis of life 
expectancy. Also, one-stage surgical treatment of concomitant aneurysm of the 
abdominal aorta and gastric cancer is well tolerated and can avoid financial 
costs, and patient anxiety involved in a second operation.

KIF1A-associated neurological diseases (KANDs) are a group of inherited 
conditions caused by changes in the microtubule (MT) motor protein KIF1A as a 
result of KIF1A gene mutations. Anterograde transport of membrane organelles is 
facilitated by the kinesin family protein encoded by the MT-based motor gene 
KIF1A. Variations in the KIF1A gene, which primarily affect the motor domain, 
disrupt its ability to transport synaptic vesicles containing synaptophysin and 
synaptotagmin leading to various neurological pathologies such as hereditary 
sensory neuropathy, autosomal dominant and recessive forms of spastic 
paraplegia, and different neurological conditions. These mutations are 
frequently misdiagnosed because they result from spontaneous, non-inherited 
genomic alterations. Whole-exome sequencing (WES), a cutting-edge method, 
assists neurologists in diagnosing the illness and in planning and choosing the 
best course of action. These conditions are simple to be identified in pediatric 
and have a life expectancy of 5-7 years. There is presently no permanent 
treatment for these illnesses, and researchers have not yet discovered a 
medicine to treat them. Scientists have more hope in gene therapy since it can 
be used to cure diseases brought on by mutations. In this review article, we 
discussed some of the experimental gene therapy methods, including gene 
replacement, gene knockdown, symptomatic gene therapy, and cell suicide gene 
therapy. It also covered its clinical symptoms, pathogenesis, current 
diagnostics, therapy, and research advances currently occurring in the field of 
KAND-related disorders. This review also explained the impact that gene therapy 
can be designed in this direction and afford the remarkable benefits to the 
patients and society.

Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid 
metabolism. It leads to the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide 
within lysosomes due to a deficiency of α-galactosidase A enzyme. It involves 
multiple organs, predominantly the renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular systems. 
Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent progression to 
irreversible tissue damage and organ failure, and to halt life-threatening 
complications that can significantly reduce life expectancy. This review will 
focus on the established and emerging treatment options for FD.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab in patients with 
treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer in Japan.

OBJECTIVE: The immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab has recently been 
recognized as a standard treatment regimen for patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer and the microsatellite-instability-high/mismatch 
repair-deficient mutation. However, its cost-effectiveness in late-line 
treatment remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for patients with 
microsatellite-instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal 
cancer.
METHODS: Markov decision modeling using treatment costs, disease-free survival 
and overall survival was performed to examine the cost-effectiveness of 
pembrolizumab monotherapy compared with chemotherapy, and best supportive care. 
The Japanese healthcare payer's perspective was adopted. The outcomes were 
modeled on the basis of published literature. The primary outcome was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between the strategies. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed and the effects of uncertainty on the model parameters 
were investigated.
RESULTS: Pembrolizumab monotherapy had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 
$408204.3 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with best supportive 
care and $489123.4 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with 
chemotherapy. Given a Japanese willingness-to-pay threshold of $69560.38 per 
quality-adjusted life-year, the base case results suggested that pembrolizumab 
monotherapy was not cost-effective. The sensitivity analysis results were in 
line with the base case results.
CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab monotherapy is not a cost-effective option in 
late-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and 
microsatellite-instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient mutation in the 
Japanese healthcare system. Further studies on its cost-effectiveness in 
first-line treatment are warranted.

Apples grown in high heat, high light, and low humidity environments are at risk 
for sun injury disorders like sunburn and associated crop losses. Understanding 
the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying sunburn will support 
improvement of mitigation strategies and breeding for more resilient varieties. 
Numerous studies have highlighted key biochemical processes involved in sun 
injury, such as the phenylpropanoid and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways, 
demonstrating both enzyme activities and expression of related genes in response 
to sunburn conditions. Most previous studies have focused on at-harvest activity 
of a small number of genes in response to heat stress. Thus, it remains unclear 
how stress events earlier in the season affect physiology and gene expression. 
Here, we applied heat stress to mid-season apples in the field and collected 
tissue along a time course-24, 48, and 72 h following a heat stimulus-to 
investigate dynamic gene expression changes using a transcriptomic lens. We 
found a relatively small number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 
enriched functional terms in response to heat treatments. Only a few of these 
belonged to pathways previously described to be involved in sunburn, such as the 
AsA-GSH pathway, while most DEGs had not yet been implicated in sunburn or heat 
stress in pome fruit.

Imbalance of bone homeostasis induces bone degenerative diseases such as 
osteoporosis. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays critical roles in regulating the 
development of limb and joint. However, its unique role in bone homeostasis 
remained largely unknown. Here, we found that canonical Hh signaling pathway was 
gradually augmented during osteoclast differentiation. Genetic inactivation of 
Hh signaling in osteoclasts, using Ctsk-Cre;Smof/f conditional knockout mice, 
disrupted both osteoclast formation and subsequent osteoclast-osteoblast 
coupling. Concordantly, either Hh signaling inhibitors or Smo/Gli2 knockdown 
stunted in vitro osteoclast formation. Mechanistically, Hh signaling positively 
regulated osteoclast differentiation via transactivation of Traf6 and 
stabilization of TRAF6 protein. Then, we identified connective tissue growth 
factor (CTGF) as an Hh-regulatory bone formation-stimulating factor derived from 
osteoclasts, whose loss played a causative role in osteopenia seen in CKO mice. 
In line with this, recombinant CTGF exerted mitigating effects against 
ovariectomy induced bone loss, supporting a potential extension of local rCTGF 
treatment to osteoporotic diseases. Collectively, our findings firstly 
demonstrate that Hh signaling, which dictates osteoclast differentiation and 
osteoclast-osteoblast coupling by regulating TRAF6 and CTGF, is crucial for 
maintaining bone homeostasis, shedding mechanistic and therapeutic insights into 
the realm of osteoporosis.

A new goal-systems model is proposed to help explain when individuals will 
protect themselves against the risks inherent to social connection. This model 
assumes that people satisfy the goal to feel included in safe social 
connections-connections where they are valued and protected rather than at risk 
of being harmed-by devaluing rejecting friends, trusting in 
expectancy-consistent relationships, and avoiding infectious strangers. In the 
hypothesized goal system, frustrating the fundamental goal to feel safe in 
social connection sensitizes regulatory systems that afford safety from the risk 
of being interpersonally rejected (i.e., the risk-regulation system), 
existentially uncertain (i.e., the social-safety system), or physically infected 
(i.e., the behavioral-immune system). Conversely, fulfilling the fundamental 
goal to feel safe in social connection desensitizes these self-protective 
systems. A 3-week experimental daily diary study (N = 555) tested the model 
hypotheses. We intervened to fulfill the goal to feel safe in social connection 
by repeatedly conditioning experimental participants to associate their romantic 
partners with highly positive, approachable words and images. We then tracked 
how vigilantly experimental versus control participants protected themselves 
when they encountered social rejection, unexpected behavior, or contagious 
illness in everyday life. Multilevel analyses revealed that the intervention 
lessoned self-protective defenses against each of these risks for participants 
who ordinarily felt most vulnerable to them. The findings provide the first 
evidence that the fundamental goal to feel safe in social connection can co-opt 
the risk-regulation, social-safety, and behavioral-immune systems as independent 
means for its pursuit. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights

Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery and Palliative Care; Chair Association of District 
Nurse and Community Nurse Educators.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a disease with poor life expectancy and high 
symptom burden. The experiences of the spouses, family and friends who care for 
this group is poorly understood, especially during palliative care and within 
the UK.
AIMS: To highlight the current gaps within research and provide some insight 
into the challenges faced by carers assisting those living with pancreatic 
cancer, and how community nurses can support this group.
METHODS: A total of five research databases were searched using the terms 
'pancreatic cancer', 'carer' and 'experience'. Cancer and palliative charity 
websites were also referenced for grey literature.
FINDINGS: There is limited research exploring pancreatic cancer carers 
experiences in the UK healthcare system and community. Available information 
suggests that this group is likely to face significant psychological and 
physical challenges to caring.
CONCLUSIONS: It is vital for community nurses to have an awareness of challenges 
this group face, to better recognise and support these vulnerable carers.

Objectives. To document the evolution of the US life expectancy disadvantage and 
regional variation across the US states. Methods. I obtained life expectancy 
estimates in 2022 from the United Nations, the Human Mortality Database, and the 
US Mortality Database, and calculated changes in growth rates, US global 
position (rank), and state-level trends. Results. Increases in US life 
expectancy slowed from 1950 to 1954 (0.21 years/annum) and 1955 to 1973 (0.10 
years/annum), accelerated from 1974 to 1982 (0.34 years/annum), and 
progressively deteriorated from 1983 to 2009 (0.15 years/annum), 2010 to 2019 
(0.06 years/annum), and 2020 to 2021 (-0.97 years/annum). Other countries 
experienced faster growth in each phase except 1974 to 1982. During 1933 to 
2021, 56 countries on 6 continents surpassed US life expectancy. Growth in US 
life expectancy was slowest in Midwest and South Central states. Conclusions. 
The US life expectancy disadvantage began in the 1950s and has steadily worsened 
over the past 4 decades. Dozens of globally diverse countries have outperformed 
the United States. Causal factors appear to have been concentrated in the 
Midwest and South. Public Health Implications. Policies that differentiate the 
United States from other countries and circumstances associated with the Midwest 
and South may have contributed. (Am J Public Health. 2023;113(9):970-980.

Chiral resolution of solutes occurring in mixtures of unrelated species is of 
relevance in life sciences and in pharmaceutical analysis. While this is 
conceptually achievable by comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography 
(LC × LC), few approaches exist whereby the second dimension comprises the 
chiral separation. The latter is preferable in combination with a conventional 
reversed phase type of separation in the first dimension as it offers an 
extension of a conventional achiral analysis. The implementation of such rapid 
chiral analyses in the second dimension was, thus far, limited by the 
challenging transfer of the first dimension mobile phase to the second dimension 
while still achieving chiral separation. In this study, the combination of 
temperature-responsive and reversed-phase chiral liquid chromatography is 
assessed in terms of enantioselective separation of a broad range of 
pharmaceutical compounds. Applying temperature-responsive liquid chromatography 
(TRLC) in the first dimension allows for analyses to be performed under purely 
aqueous conditions, which then allows for complete and more generic refocusing 
of (organic) solutes prior to the second dimension. This offers an enhanced 
ability to employ fast and broad compositional gradients over the chiral 
dimension, which broadens the applicability of the technique. In the proposed 
platform, seven chiral columns (superficially porous and fully porous columns 
(comprising both polysaccharide and macrocyclic antibiotic phases)) and four 
mobile phase gradients were screened on a pharmaceutical test mixture. The 
platform was shown to be able to offer the necessary resolving power for the 
molecules at hand and offers a new approach for chiral screening of mixtures of 
unrelated compounds.

INTRODUCTION: Static spine and pelvic posture has been reported to be associated 
with symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), but it is unknown 
whether dynamic alignment of the spine and pelvis is associated with lumbar 
function in daily life. This study aims to investigate the relationship between 
dynamic alignment of the spine and pelvis during gait and lumbar function in 
daily life in patients with LSS.
METHODS: We evaluated lumbar function in daily life using the Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI), trunk and hip muscle strength as physical function, 
static spinal alignment, and dynamic spinal/pelvic alignment during gait. The 
relationship between the ODI score and physical function or static and dynamic 
alignment was examined.
RESULTS: A total of 35 preoperative patients with LSS participated in this 
study. ODI score significantly correlated with trunk extension strength 
(r = -0.578, p = 0.000), hip extension strength (r = -0.472, p = 0.004), maximum 
spinal flexion angle during gait (r = -0.473, p = 0.004) and maximum pelvic 
anterior tilt angle (r = 0.510, p = 0.002). Multiple regression analysis showed 
that trunk extension strength (standardized β; - 0.309), hip extension strength 
(standardized β; -0.287), maximum spinal flexion angle (standardized β; - 0.306) 
and maximum pelvic anterior tilt angle (standardized β; 0.271) significantly 
affected the ODI score, with adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.529.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the patients with LSS with 
weak hip or trunk extensor muscles, a greater angle of pelvic tilt or a less 
spinal flexion during gait had a lower lumbar function in daily life.

BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to investigate the association between psychological 
distress and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE).
METHODS: In 2006, a cohort study was conducted of 12,365 Japanese individuals 
aged ≥65 years, who were followed-up for 13 years. Psychological distress was 
measured using the Kessler 6-item psychological distress scale and was 
categorized into no (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-12), and serious distress 
(13-24). The number of participants was 1277 (22.4 %) for mild distress, 330 
(5.8 %) for moderate, and 208 (3.6 %) for serious in men, and was 1635 (24.6 %), 
467 (7.0 %), and 384 (5.8 %) in women. Sex-specific DFLE was defined as the mean 
years a person could expect to live without disability and calculated by 
Interpolated Markov Chain (IMaCh) software.
RESULTS: Compared to no distress, DFLE loss per person was 1.21, 2.61, and 
4.43 years for mild, moderate, and serious distress respectively in men. At 
population level, DFEL loss (i.e., DFLE loss per person×number of participants) 
was 1545.17, 861.30, and 921.44 years for mild, moderate, and serious distress 
respectively in men. Accordingly, 46.4 % of the total DFLE loss was attributable 
to mild distress, 25.9 % to moderate, and 27.7 % to serious in men. Similarly, 
the results were 42.2 %, 25.4 %, and 32.4 % in women.
LIMITATIONS: Psychological distress was measured only once at baseline, and 2409 
participants were excluded from the analysis because of missing data on 
exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: At population level, almost half of the total DFLE loss could be 
attributable to mild distress, underscoring the importance of population 
strategy for all levels of distress in promoting healthy aging.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare bone marrow failure syndrome, usually 
caused by loss-of function variants in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. The 
hallmarks of DBA are anemia, congenital anomalies and cancer predisposition. 
Although DBA usually presents in childhood, the prevalence in later life is 
increasing due to an expanding repertoire of implicated genes, improvements in 
genetic diagnosis and increasing life expectancy. Adult patients uniquely suffer 
the manifestations of end-organ damage caused by the disease and its treatment, 
and transition to adulthood poses specific issues in disease management. To 
standardize and optimize care for this rare disease, in this review we provide 
updated guidance on the diagnosis and management of DBA, with a specific focus 
on older adolescents and adults. Recommendations are based upon published 
literature and our pooled clinical experience from three centres in the United 
Kingdom (U·K.). Uniquely we have also solicited and incorporated the views of 
affected families, represented by the independent patient organization, DBA U.K.

The expected year-on-year intrinsic mortality variations/changes are largely 
overlooked in the existing research when estimating the effect of the COVID-19 
pandemic on mortality patterns. To fill this gap, this study provides a new 
assessment of the loss of life expectancy caused by COVID-19 in 27 countries 
considering both the actual and the expected changes in life expectancy between 
2019 and 2020. Life expectancy in 2020 and the expected life expectancy in the 
absence of COVID-19 are estimated using the Lee-Carter model and data primarily 
from the Human Mortality Database. The results show that life expectancy in 21 
of the 27 countries was expected to increase in 2020 had COVID-19 not occurred. 
By considering the expected mortality changes between 2019 and 2020, the study 
shows that, on average, the loss of life expectancy among the 27 countries in 
2020 amounted to 1.33 year (95% CI 1.29-1.37) at age 15 and 0.91 years (95% CI 
0.88-0.94) at age 65. Our results suggest that if the year-on-year intrinsic 
variations/changes in mortality were considered, the effects of COVID-19 on 
mortality are more profound than previously understood. This is particularly 
prominent for countries experiencing greater life expectancy increase in recent 
years.

INTRODUCTION: Advances in the management of intestinal failure have led to a 
reduction in the number of intestinal transplants. The number of bowel 
transplants has been mainly stable even though a slight increase has been 
observed in the last 5 years.
AREAS COVERED: Standard indication includes patients with a reasonable life 
expectancy. Recent progress can be deduced by the increased number of intestine 
transplants in adults: this is due to the continuous improvement of 1-year graft 
survival worldwide (without differences in 3- and 5-year) associated with better 
abdominal wall closure techniques. This review aims to provide an update on new 
indications and changes in trends of pediatric and adult intestine 
transplantation. This analysis, which stretches through the past 5 years, is 
based on a collection of related manuscripts from PubMed.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Intestinal transplants should be solely intended for a group 
of individuals for whom indications for transplantation are clear and both 
medical and surgical rehabilitations have failed. Nevertheless, many protocols 
developed over the years have not yet solved the key question represented by the 
over-immunosuppression. Novel indications and recent progress in the bowel 
transplant field, minimal yet consistent, represent a pathway to be followed.

Deprescribing decision making in older adults with limited life expectancy is 
often challenging for clinicians. We aimed to develop and validate a 
Deprescribing Tool for Older People with Limited-life Expectancy (De-TOPPLE). 
Modified Delphi technique was used to gain experts' consensus on the tool and 
further develop using their feedback. Experts [Round-1 (n = 13), Round-2 
(n = 7)] had clinical and/or research background on geriatric medicine, 
geriatrics, family medicine or pharmacotherapy. Round-1 consensus was achieved 
on approach taken by the tool to evaluate risk and benefit; distinguishing 
medications as preventive, symptom control or dual-purpose; referring to 
established deprescribing process; stepwise approach to deprescribing; and the 
overall concept. Common feedback was to reflect upon harm-benefit analysis, 
distinguish medication types earlier, qualify adverse events, use 
time-to-benefit (TTB), prioritise symptom relief, monitor post-deprescribing, 
include shared decision making and define terms for clinical familiarisation. 
After tool update, Round-2 consensus was achieved on usability in clinical 
setting, flexibility of implicit judgement, ceasing preventive medication with 
inadequate TTB, ceasing symptom control medication with inadequate symptom 
relief, ceasing dual-purpose medication (DPM) with inadequate TTB and symptom 
relief, and continuing DPM with adequate TTB and symptom relief. De-TOPPLE 
version 1 was developed and validated through two rounds of the Delphi process. 
Clinical use of the tool needs final validation following the addition of 
contextual statements to the tool.
