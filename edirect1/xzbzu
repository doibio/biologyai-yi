ranged from 18.1 to 88.4% depending on the ventilator dependency, level and 
completeness of injury, age and gender.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy after SCI improved significantly between the 1950s 
and 1980s, plateaued during the 1990s and 2000s, before slightly improving again 
since 2010, but still remains well below that of the general British population.

Pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis are the two most important 
manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is the third most common 
life-threatening cardiovascular disease in the United States. Anticoagulation is 
the mainstay of VTE treatment. Most patients with deep venous thrombosis or 
low-risk pulmonary embolism can be treated in the outpatient setting with 
low-molecular-weight heparin and a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or 
direct-acting oral anticoagulants. Inpatient treatment of VTE begins with 
parenteral agents, preferably low-molecular-weight heparin. Unfractionated 
heparin is used if a patient is hemodynamically unstable or has severe renal 
insufficiency, high bleeding risk, hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity. 
Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are an alternative; however, concerns include 
cost and use of reversing agents (currently available only for dabigatran, 
although others are in development). If warfarin, dabigatran, or edoxaban is 
used, low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin must be administered 
concomitantly for at least five days and, in the case of warfarin, until the 
international normalized ratio becomes therapeutic for 24 hours. Hemodynamically 
unstable patients with a low bleeding risk may benefit from thrombolytic 
therapy. An inferior vena cava filter is not indicated for patients treated with 
anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend anticoagulation for a minimum of 
three months. Special situations, such as active cancer and pregnancy, require 
long-term use of low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin. Anticoagulation 
beyond three months should be individualized based on a risk/benefit analysis. 
Symptomatic distal deep venous thrombosis should be treated with 
anticoagulation, but asymptomatic patients may be monitored with serial imaging 
for two weeks and treated only if there is extension.

National estimates of the health and economic burdens of exposure to ambient 
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in India reveal substantial impacts. This 
information, often lacking at the local level, can justify and drive mitigation 
interventions. Here, we assess the health and economic gains resulting from 
attainment of WHO guidelines for PM2.5 concentrations - including interim target 
2 (IT-2), interim target 3 (IT-3), and the WHO air quality guideline (AQG) - in 
Nagpur district to inform policy decision making for mitigation. We conducted a 
detailed assessment of concentrations of PM2.5 in 9 areas, covering urban, 
peri-urban and rural environments, from February 2013 to June 2014. We used a 
combination of hazard and survival analyses based on the life table method to 
calculate attributed annual number of premature deaths and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) for five health outcomes linked to PM2.5 exposure: acute 
lower respiratory infection for children <5years, ischemic heart disease, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke and lung cancer in adults 
≥25years. We used GBD 2013 data on deaths and DALYs for these diseases. We 
calculated averted deaths, DALYs and economic loss resulting from planned 
reductions in average PM2.5 concentration from current level to IT-2, IT-3 and 
AQG by the years 2023, 2033 and 2043, respectively. The economic cost for 
premature mortality was estimated as the product of attributed deaths and value 
of statistical life for India, while morbidity was assumed to be 10% of the 
mortality cost. The annual average PM2.5 concentration in Nagpur district is 
34±17μgm-3 and results in 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 4.2) thousand 
premature deaths and 91 (95% CI: 68, 116) thousand DALYs in 2013 with economic 
loss of USD 2.2 (95% CI: 1.7, 2.8) billion in that year. It is estimated that 
interventions that achieve IT-2, IT-3 and AQG by 2023, 2033 and 2043, would 
avert, respectively, 15, 30 and 36%, of the attributed health and economic loss 
in those years, translating into an impressively large health and economic gain. 
To achieve this, we recommend an exposure-integrated source reduction approach.

PURPOSE: Sevelamer, a noncalcium phosphate binder, has been shown to attenuate 
the progression of vascular calcification and improve survival in patients with 
chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis compared with calcium-based binders. 
Using real-world data from a cohort study and the Health Insurance Review and 
Assessment Service database, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis 
comparing sevelamer with calcium acetate in dialysis patients from the 
perspective of the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea.
METHODS: Data (demographic, diagnostic, laboratory, and survival) from 4674 
patients undergoing dialysis enrolled in a multicenter prospective cohort study 
conducted in South Korea between September 2008 and December 2012 were linked to 
phosphate binder use, hospitalization, and cost data available from the Health 
Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. After propensity score 
matching, a dataset comprising comparable patients treated with either sevelamer 
(n = 501) or calcium acetate (n = 501) was used in the cost-effectiveness 
analysis. A Markov model was used to estimate costs, life years, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness over each patient's 
lifetime. Forty-month treatment-specific overall survival (OS) data available 
from the dataset were extrapolated to lifetime survival with the use of 
regression analysis.
FINDINGS: Patients had a mean age of 56.3 years and were treated with dialysis 
for a mean duration of 67.6 months. Compared with calcium acetate, sevelamer was 
associated with an incremental cost of South Korean Won (₩) 12,246,911 ($10,819) 
and a gain of 1.758 life years and 1.108 QALYs per patient. This outcome yielded 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ₩6,966,350 ($6154) and ₩11,057,699 
($9768) per life year and QALY gained, respectively. Conclusions regarding 
sevelamer's cost-effectiveness were insensitive to alternative assumptions in 
time horizon, discount rate, hospitalization rate, costs, and health utility 
estimates, and they remained consistent in 100% of the model iterations, 
considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of ₩31,894,720 ($28,176) per QALY 
gained.
IMPLICATIONS: This analysis of real-world data found that sevelamer's higher 
cost relative to calcium acetate was adequately offset by improved survival 
among patients undergoing dialysis in South Korea. As such, sevelamer offers 
good value for money, representing a cost-effective alternative to calcium-based 
binders.

Life expectancy in patients with multiple myeloma is increasing because of the 
availability of an increasing number of novel agents with various mechanisms of 
action against the disease. However, the disease remains incurable in most 
patients because of the emergence of resistant clones, leading to repeated 
relapses of the disease. In 2015, 5 novel agents were approved for therapy for 
relapsed multiple myeloma. This surfeit of novel agents renders management of 
relapsed multiple myeloma more complex because of the occurrence of multiple 
relapses, the risk of cumulative and emergent toxicity from previous therapies, 
as well as evolution of the disease during therapy. A group of physicians at 
Mayo Clinic with expertise in the care of patients with multiple myeloma 
regularly evaluates the evolving literature on the biology and therapy for 
multiple myeloma and issues guidelines on the optimal care of patients with this 
disease. In this article, the latest recommendations on the diagnostic 
evaluation of relapsed multiple myeloma and decision trees on how to treat 
patients at various stages of their relapse (off study) are provided together 
with the evidence to support them.

BACKGROUND: Due to the good biocompatibility, biodegradability, facile surface 
functionalization and high water solubility, Bovine serum albumin has gain 
increasing attention in the nanomedicine.
OBJECTIVE: Despite there are many reviews on albumin based nanoparticles, most 
of them focus on one aspect of the albumin functionality, e.g., drug delivery, 
cancer theranostics or half-life extension in vivo. This review aims to 
comprehensively summary bovine serum albumin as a versatile platform in the 
applications of cancer imaging and therapy.
METHODS: We review the extensive applications of bovine serum albumin in drug 
carrier, surface engineering and biomimetic synthesis for cancer imaging and 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: Based on the studies reviewed, variety of in vitro and in vivo 
studies show good performance of bovine serum albumin as the drug carrier, 
surface modification agent and biomimetic template in cancer imaging and 
therapy. Nevertheless, there are still some issues to be solved, e.g., the 
technological parameters for enhancing the drug loading efficiency and 
controlling drug release, optimizing surface modification process to provide 
more stable nanoagents, investigation of the biomimetic mechanism, in-depth 
study of their toxicity, further exploring their bioapplications, etc.

BACKGROUND: The sustained health-related quality-of-life of patients surviving 
community-acquired pneumonia has not been accurately quantified. The aim of the 
current study was to quantify differences in health-related quality-of-life of 
community-dwelling elderly with and without community-acquired pneumonia during 
a 12-month follow-up period.
METHODS: In a matched cohort study design, nested in a prospective randomized 
double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of the 13-valent 
pneumococcal vaccine in community-dwelling persons of ≥65 years, health-related 
quality-of-life was assessed in 562 subjects hospitalized with suspected 
community-acquired pneumonia (i.e. diseased cohort) and 1145 unaffected persons 
(i.e. non-diseased cohort) matched to pneumonia cases on age, sex, and health 
status (EQ-5D-3L-index). Health-related quality-of-life was determined 1-2 weeks 
after hospital discharge/inclusion and 1, 6 and 12 months thereafter, using 
Euroqol EQ-5D-3L and Short Form-36 Health survey questionnaires. One-year 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated for both diseased and 
non-diseased cohorts. Separate analyses were performed for pneumonia cases with 
and without radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia.
RESULTS: The one-year excess QALY loss attributed to community-acquired 
pneumonia was 0.13. Mortality in the post-discharge follow-up year was 8.4% in 
community-acquired pneumonia patients and 1.2% in non-diseased persons 
(p < 0.001). During follow-up health-related quality-of-life was persistently 
lower in community-acquired pneumonia patients, compared to non-diseased 
persons, but differences in health-related quality-of-life between 
radiologically confirmed and non-confirmed community-acquired pneumonia cases 
were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired pneumonia was associated with a six-fold 
increased mortality and 16% lower quality-of-life in the post-discharge year 
among patients surviving hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia, 
compared to non-diseased persons.

OBJECTIVES: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the use of 
transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with that of sorafenib in the treatment 
of patients with intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system.
METHODS: Patient-level data were consecutively recorded and collected at three 
oncology centers in Italy. A propensity score matching was performed to compare 
patients with similar clinical characteristics who underwent TARE or sorafenib 
treatment. Clinical data from the matched cohorts were used to populate a Markov 
model to project, on a lifetime horizon, life years, quality-adjusted life 
years, and economic outcomes associated with TARE and sorafenib for both 
intermediate and advanced HCC stages.
RESULTS: Starting from data covering 389 and 241 patients who underwent TARE and 
sorafenib treatment, respectively, the propensity score matching yielded a total 
of 308 matched patients. For intermediate-stage patients, the model estimated 
for TARE versus sorafenib an incremental cost-utility ratio of €3,302/QALY 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €1,865 per life year gained), whereas 
for patients in advanced stage TARE dominated (lower costs and greater health 
improvements) compared with sorafenib.
CONCLUSIONS: From an Italian health care service perspective, TARE could be a 
cost-effective strategy in comparison with sorafenib for patients with 
intermediate or advanced HCC. The results from forthcoming randomized controlled 
trials comparing TARE with sorafenib will be able to confirm or reject the 
validity of this preliminary evaluation. In the meantime, decision makers can 
use these results to control and coordinate the diffusion of the technology.

Hyogo, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: In Japan, cost-effectiveness evaluation was implemented on a trial 
basis from fiscal year 2016. The results will be applied to the future repricing 
of drugs and medical devices. On the basis of a request from the Central Social 
Insurance Medical Council (Chuikyo), our research team drafted the official 
methodological guideline for trial implementation. Here, we report the process 
of developing and the contents of the official guideline for cost-effectiveness 
evaluation.
METHODS: The guideline reflects discussions at the Chuikyo subcommittee (e.g., 
the role of quality-adjusted life-year) and incorporates our academic 
perspective. Team members generated research questions for each section of the 
guideline and discussions on these questions were carried out. A draft guideline 
was prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), 
and then to the subcommittee. The draft guideline was revised on the basis of 
the discussions at the subcommitte, if appropriate.
RESULTS: Although the "public health care payer's perspective" is standard in 
this guideline, other perspectives can be applied as necessary depending on the 
objective of analysis. On the basis of the discussions at the subcommittee, 
quality-adjusted life-year will be used as the basic outcome. A discount rate of 
2% per annum for costs and outcomes is recommended. The final guideline was 
officially approved by the Chuikyo general assembly in February 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first officially approved guideline for the economic 
evaluation of drugs and medical devices in Japan. The guideline is expected to 
improve the quality and comparability of submitted cost-effectiveness data for 
decision making.

BACKGROUND: In September 2014, the PARADIGM-HF trial showed the heart failure 
drug combination sacubitril/valsartan to be superior to enalapril for patients 
with a reduced ejection fraction.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in the Netherlands using the 
clinical data from the PARADIGM-HF trial.
METHODS: To compare sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril in a cost-effectiveness 
study, a Markov model was developed using the effectiveness data from the 
PARADIGM-HF trial. A health care payer's perspective was applied in the economic 
evaluation. The developed model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness for 
sacubitril/valsartan at different per diem prices.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that sacubitril/valsartan can be 
cost-effective at maximum daily costs of €5.50 and €14.14 considering 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of €20,000 and €50,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY), respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness 
of the model, identifying only the price of sacubitril/valsartan and the 
mortality within the sacubitril/valsartan group as significant drivers of the 
cost-effectiveness ratio. Sacubitril/valsartan was cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY (€50,000 per QALY) in more than 
80% of the replications with certainty at the price point of €3 (€10).
CONCLUSIONS: Sacubitril/valsartan can be considered a cost-effective treatment 
at a daily price of €5.25. Unless priced lower than enalapril (<€0.045 per day), 
sacubitril/valsartan is very unlikely to be cost-saving/dominant.

OBJECTIVES: To validate outcomes of presently available chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) cost-effectiveness models against results of two large 
COPD trials-the 3-year TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) trial and the 
4-year Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium 
(UPLIFT) trial.
METHODS: Participating COPD modeling groups simulated the outcomes for the 
placebo-treated groups of the TORCH and UPLIFT trials using baseline 
characteristics of the trial populations as input. Groups then simulated 
treatment effectiveness by using relative reductions in annual decline in lung 
function and exacerbation frequency observed in the most intensively treated 
group compared with placebo as input for the models. Main outcomes were (change 
in) total/severe exacerbations and mortality. Furthermore, the absolute 
differences in total exacerbations and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
used to approximate the cost per exacerbation avoided and the cost per QALY 
gained.
RESULT: Of the six participating models, three models reported higher total 
exacerbation rates than observed in the TORCH trial (1.13/patient-year) (models: 
1.22-1.48). Four models reported higher rates than observed in the UPLIFT trial 
(0.85/patient-year) (models: 1.13-1.52). Two models reported higher mortality 
rates than in the TORCH trial (15.2%) (models: 20.0% and 30.6%) and the UPLIFT 
trial (16.3%) (models: 24.8% and 36.0%), whereas one model reported lower rates 
(9.8% and 12.1%, respectively). Simulation of treatment effectiveness showed 
that the absolute reduction in total exacerbations, the gain in QALYs, and the 
cost-effectiveness ratios did not differ from the trials, except for one model.
CONCLUSIONS: Although most of the participating COPD cost-effectiveness models 
reported higher total exacerbation rates than observed in the trials, estimates 
of the absolute treatment effect and cost-effectiveness ratios do not seem 
different from the trials in most models.

BACKGROUND: There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal surgical treatment of 
complex proximal humeral fractures in elderly patients.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reverse total shoulder 
arthroplasty (RTSA) compared with hemiarthroplasty (HA) in the management of 
complex proximal humeral fractures, using a cost-utility analysis.
METHODS: On the basis of data from published literature, a cost-utility analysis 
was conducted using decision tree and Markov modeling. A single-payer 
perspective, with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of Can$50,000 (Canadian 
dollars), and a lifetime time horizon were used. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the study's primary outcome measure.
RESULTS: In comparison with HA, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained for RTSA was Can$13,679. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed 
the model to be sensitive to the RTSA implant cost and the RTSA procedural cost. 
The ICER of Can$13,679 is well below the WTP threshold of Can$50,000, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 92.6% of model simulations 
favored RTSA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our economic analysis found that RTSA for the treatment of complex 
proximal humeral fractures in the elderly is the preferred economic strategy 
when compared with HA. The ICER of RTSA is well below standard WTP thresholds, 
and its estimate of cost-effectiveness is similar to other highly successful 
orthopedic strategies such as total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of hip 
arthritis.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the 3-year cost-effectiveness of a nurse-based case 
management intervention in elderly patients with myocardial infarction from a 
societal perspective.
METHODS: The intervention consisted of one home visit and quarterly telephone 
calls in the first year, and semi-annual calls in the following 2 years. The 
primary effect measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), on the basis 
of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) and adjusted life-years 
from patients' self-rated health states according to the visual analogue scale 
(VAS-ALs). A linear regression model was used for adjusted life-years and a 
gamma model for costs. Estimation uncertainty was addressed by 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, which indicate the likelihood of 
cost-effectiveness for a given value of willingness to pay. The secondary 
objective was to examine EQ-5D-3L utility scores and VAS scores among survivors 
using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: Primary outcomes regarding QALY gains (+0.0295; P = 0.76) and VAS-AL 
gains (+0.1332; P = 0.09) in the intervention group were not significant. The 
overall cost difference was -€2575 (P = 0.30). The probability of 
cost-effectiveness of the case management at a willingness-to-pay value of €0 
per QALY was 84% in the case of QALYs and 81% in the case of VAS-ALs. Secondary 
outcomes concerning survivors' quality of life were significantly better in the 
intervention group (EQ-5D-3L utilities: +0.104, P = 0.005; VAS: +8.15, P = 
0.001) after 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The case management was cost-neutral and led to an important and 
significant improvement in health status among survivors. It was associated with 
higher QALYs and lower costs but the differences in costs and QALYs were not 
statistically significant.

The efficacy of medicines, medical devices, and other health technologies should 
be proved in trials that assess final patient-relevant outcomes such as survival 
or morbidity. Market access and coverage decisions are, however, often based on 
surrogate end points, biomarkers, or intermediate end points, which aim to 
substitute and predict patient-relevant outcomes that are unavailable because of 
methodological, financial, or practical constraints. We provide a summary of the 
present use of surrogate end points in health care policy, discussing the case 
for and against their adoption and reviewing validation methods. We introduce a 
three-step framework for policymakers to handle surrogates, which involves 
establishing the level of evidence, assessing the strength of the association, 
and quantifying relations between surrogates and final outcomes. Although the 
use of surrogates can be problematic, they can, when selected and validated 
appropriately, offer important opportunities for more efficient clinical trials 
and faster access to new health technologies that benefit patients and health 
care systems.

Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is rightly receiving increasing attention 
in health technology assessment. Nevertheless, a distinguishing feature of the 
health domain is that technologies must actually improve health, and good 
performance on other criteria cannot compensate for failure to do so. We argue 
for two reasonable tests for MCDA models: the treacle test (can a winning 
intervention be incompletely ineffective?) and the smallpox test (can a winning 
intervention be for a disease that no one suffers from?). We explore why models 
might fail such tests (as the models of some existing published studies would 
do) and offer some suggestions as to how practice should be improved.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is defined as chronic fibrosing interstitial 
pneumonia limited to the lung, with poor prognosis. The incidence has been 
rising in recent years probably due to improved diagnostic methods and increased 
life expectancy. In 2013, the SEPAR guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment 
for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were published. Since then, clinical trials 
and meta-analyses have shown strong scientific evidence for the use of 
pirfenidone and nintedanib in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In 
2015, the international consensus of 2011 was updated and new therapeutic 
recommendations were established, prompting us to update our recommendation for 
the medical treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis accordingly. Diagnostic 
aspects and non-pharmacological treatment will not be discussed as no relevant 
developments have emerged since the 2013 guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Antenatal depression and use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) 
in pregnancy have both been associated with an increased risk of poor pregnancy 
outcomes, such as preterm birth and impaired fetal growth. While the underlying 
biological pathways for these complications are poorly understood, it has been 
hypothesized that inflammation may be a common physiological pathway. The aim of 
the present study was to assess peripheral inflammatory markers in healthy 
women, women with antenatal depression, and in women using SSRI during 
pregnancy.
METHODS: 160 healthy pregnant controls, 59 women with antenatal depression and 
39 women on treatment with SSRIs were included. The relative levels of 92 
inflammatory proteins were analyzed by proximity extension assay technology.
RESULTS: Overall, 23 of the inflammatory markers were significantly lower in 
women with antenatal depression and in women on treatment with SSRIs in 
comparison with the healthy controls. No difference in any of the inflammatory 
markers was observed between women with antenatal depression and those who were 
using SSRI. Top three inflammatory markers that were down-regulated in women 
with antenatal depression were TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), 
p=0.000001, macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), p=0.000004, and 
fractalkine (CX3CL1), p=0.000005. Corresponding inflammatory markers in SSRI 
users were CSF-1, p=0.000011, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), 
p=0.000016, and IL-15 receptor subunit alpha (IL-15RA), p=0.000027. The 
inflammatory markers were negatively correlated with cortisone serum 
concentrations in controls, but not in the cases. Differential DNA methylation 
of was found for seven of these inflammatory markers in an independent 
epigenetics cohort.
CONCLUSION: Women with antenatal depression or on SSRI treatment have lower 
levels of a number of peripheral inflammatory markers than healthy pregnant 
controls. Hypothetically, this could be due to dysregulated switch to the pro-M2 
milieu that characterizes normal third trimester pregnancy. However, 
longitudinal blood sampling is needed to elucidate whether the presumably 
dysregulated M2 shift is driving the development of antenatal depression or is a 
result of the depression.

BACKGROUND: It is known that parents have lower mortality than childless 
individuals. Support from adult children to ageing parents may be of importance 
for parental health and longevity. The aim of this study was to estimate the 
association between having a child and the risk of death, and to examine whether 
the association increased at older ages when health starts to deteriorate and 
the need of support from a family member increases.
METHODS: In this nationwide study, all men and women (born between 1911 and 1925 
and residing in Sweden), as well as their children, were identified in 
population registers and followed over time. Age-specific death risks were 
calculated for each calendar year for individuals having at least one child and 
for individuals without children. Adjusted risk differences and risk ratios were 
estimated.
RESULTS: Men and women having at least one child experienced lower death risks 
than childless men and women. At 60 years of age, the difference in life 
expectancy was 2 years for men and 1.5 years for women. The absolute differences 
in death risks increased with parents' age and were somewhat larger for men than 
for women. The association persisted when the potential confounding effect of 
having a partner was taken into account. The gender of the child did not matter 
for the association between parenthood and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Having children is associated with increased longevity, 
particularly in an absolute sense in old age. That the association increased 
with parents' age and was somewhat stronger for the non-married may suggest that 
social support is a possible explanation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term safety and tolerability of a once-daily, 
dual-release hydrocortisone (DR-HC) tablet as oral glucocorticoid replacement 
therapy in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (AI).
DESIGN: Prospective, open-label, multicenter, 5-year extension study of DR-HC 
conducted at five university clinics in Sweden.
METHODS: Seventy-one adult patients diagnosed with primary AI who were receiving 
stable glucocorticoid replacement therapy were recruited. Safety and 
tolerability outcomes included adverse events (AEs), intercurrent illness 
episodes, laboratory parameters and vital signs. Quality of life (QoL) was 
evaluated using generic questionnaires.
RESULTS: Total DR-HC exposure was 328 patient-treatment years. Seventy patients 
reported 1060 AEs (323 per 100 patient-years); 85% were considered unrelated to 
DR-HC by the investigator. The most common AEs were nasopharyngitis (70%), 
fatigue (52%) and gastroenteritis (48%). Of 65 serious AEs reported by 32 
patients (20 per 100 patient-years), four were considered to be possibly related 
to DR-HC: acute AI (n = 2), gastritis (n = 1) and syncope (n = 1). Two deaths 
were reported (fall from height and subarachnoid hemorrhage), both considered to 
be unrelated to DR-HC. From baseline to 5 years, intercurrent illness episodes 
remained relatively stable (mean 2.6-5.4 episodes per patient per year), fasting 
plasma glucose (0.7 mmol/L; P < 0.0001) and HDL cholesterol (0.2 mmol/L; 
P < 0.0001) increased and patient-/investigator-assessed tolerability improved. 
QoL total scores were unchanged but worsening physical functioning was recorded 
(P = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: In the first prospective study evaluating the long-term safety of 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy in patients with primary AI, DR-HC was well 
tolerated with no safety concerns observed during 5-year treatment.
