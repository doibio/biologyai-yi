Human immunodeficiency type 1 virus accessory protein Nef is a key modulator of 
AIDS pathogenesis. With no enzymatic activity, Nef regulated functions in host 
cells largely depends on its ability to form multi-protein complex with the 
cellular proteins. Here, we identified Calcium (Ca2+)/Calmodulin dependent 
protein kinase II subunit delta (CAMKIIδ) as novel Nef interacting host protein. 
Further, we confirmed that Nef mediated [Ca2+]I promote formation of Nef-CAMKIIδ 
- apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK-1) heterotrimeric complex. The 
assembly of Nef with CAMKIIδ - ASK-1 inhibits the downstream p38MAPK 
phosphorylation resulting in abrogation of apoptosis. Further, using competitive 
peptide inhibitors against Nef binding domains to CAMKIIδ, identified in the 
present study and ASK-1, individually blocked physical interaction of Nef with 
CAMKIIδ-ASK-1 complex and restored p38MAPK phosphorylation and apoptosis. 
Altogether, our study indicates that HIV-Nef modulates cytosolic [Ca2+]I and 
blocks CAMKIIδ - ASK-1 kinase activity to inhibit apoptosis of infected cells.

Fluorescent proteins are valuable tools in the bioscience field especially in 
subcellular localization analysis of proteins and expression analysis of genes. 
Fusion with organelle-targeting signal accumulates fluorescent proteins in 
specific organelles, increases local brightness, and highlights the signal of 
fluorescent proteins even in tissues emitting a high background of 
autofluorescence. For these advantages, organelle-targeted fluorescent proteins 
are preferably used for promoter:reporter assay to define organ-, tissue-, or 
cell-specific expression pattern of genes in detail. In this study, we have 
developed a new series of Gateway cloning technology-compatible binary vectors, 
pGWBs (attR1-attR2 acceptor sites) and R4L1pGWB (attR4-attL1 acceptor sites), 
carrying organelle-targeted synthetic green fluorescent protein with S65T 
mutation (sGFP) (ER-, nucleus-, peroxisome-, and mitochondria-targeted sGFP) and 
organelle-targeted tag red fluorescent protein (TagRFP) (nucleus-, peroxisome-, 
and mitochondria-targeted TagRFP). These are available for preparation of 
promoter:reporter constructs by an LR reaction with a promoter entry clone 
attL1-promoter-attL2 (for pGWBs) or attL4-promoter-attR1 (for R4L1pGWBs), 
respectively. A transient expression experiment with particle bombardment using 
cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter-driven constructs has confirmed the 
correct localization of newly developed organelle-targeted TagRFPs by a 
co-localization analysis with the previously established organelle-targeted 
sGFPs. More intense and apparent fluorescence signals were detected by the 
nucleus- and peroxisome-targeted sGFPs than by the normal sGFPs in the promoter 
assay using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. The new pGWBs and R4L1pGWBs 
developed here are highly efficient and may serve as useful platforms for more 
accurate observation of GFP and RFP signals in gene expression analyses of 
plants.

PURPOSE: During total knee arthroplasty (TKA), an orthopaedic surgeon is focused 
on soft-tissue balance in extension (0°) and in flexion (90°). Patients with 
instability problems of the knee often report a feeling of instability during 
daily life activities, at around 30° knee flexion. There are no reference values 
available for knee laxity of healthy subjects in mid-flexion (30°) and flexion 
(90°) for comparison with the TKA population. Therefore, the aim was to quantify 
varus and valgus knee laxity in extension, mid-flexion and flexion in the 
asymptomatic native knee.
METHODS: In 40 healthy volunteers matched for age, gender and BMI with the 
TKA-population, varus and valgus knee laxity in extension (0°), mid-flexion 
(30°) and flexion (90°) was measured on low-dose radiographs. For each subject, 
one randomly selected knee was stressed in extension, mid-flexion and flexion 
(with 15 Nm) using a stress device.
RESULTS: Varus laxity in mid-flexion was higher than in extension and flexion 
(p < 0.01). Valgus laxity tended to be highest in mid-flexion laxity; however, 
no differences in knee laxity between flexion angles were seen (n.s.). Varus 
knee laxity in extension was higher in females than in males (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Mid-flexion laxity in the native knee is more prominent on the 
lateral side of the knee, while the medial side is more stable and constrained. 
Varus knee laxity in extension was shown to be higher in females than in males.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

The accurate measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the value 
of improving it for patients are essential for deriving quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) to inform treatment choice and resource allocation. The objective 
of this review was to identify and describe the approaches used to measure and 
value change in HRQoL in trial-based economic evaluations of heart failure 
interventions which derive QALYs as an outcome. Three databases (PubMed, CINAHL, 
Cochrane) were systematically searched. Twenty studies reporting economic 
evaluations based on 18 individual trials were identified. Most studies (n = 17) 
utilised generic preference-based measures to describe HRQoL and derive QALYs, 
commonly the EQ-5D-3L. Of these, three studies (from the same trial) also used 
mapping from a condition-specific to a generic measure. The remaining three 
studies used patients' direct valuation of their own health or 
physician-reported outcomes to derive QALYs. Only 7 of the 20 studies reported 
significant incremental QALY gains. Most interventions were reported as being 
likely to be cost-effective at specified willingness to pay thresholds. The 
substantial variation in the approach applied to derive QALYs in the measurement 
of and value attributed to HRQoL in heart failure requires further 
investigation.

Dendrobium officinale is a traditional medicinal herb with a variety of 
bioactive components. Alkaloid is one of the major active ingredients of 
Dendrobium plants, and its immune regulatory effects have been well-studied. 
Although a number of genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of alkaloids 
have been elucidated, the regulation mechanism underlying the methyl-jasmonate 
(MeJA)-induced accumulation of alkaloids in D. officinale is largely unknown. In 
our study, a total of 4,857 DEGs, including 2,943 up- and 1,932 down-regulated 
genes, were identified between the control and MeJA-treated groups. Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation showed that a number of DEGs were 
associated with the putative alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in D. officinale. The 
main group of Dendrobium alkaloids are sesquiterpene alkaloids, which are the 
downstream products of mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) 
pathway. Several MVA and MEP pathway genes were significantly up-regulated by 
the MeJA treatment, suggesting an active precursor supply for the alkaloid 
biosynthesis under MeJA treatment. A number of MeJA-induced P450 family genes, 
aminotransferase genes and methyltransferase genes were identified, providing 
several important candidates to further elucidate the sesquiterpene alkaloid 
biosynthetic pathway of D. officinale. Furthermore, a large number of 
MeJA-induced transcript factor encoding genes were identified, suggesting a 
complex genetic network affecting the sesquiterpene alkaloid metabolism in D. 
officinale. Our data aids to reveal the regulation mechanism underlying the 
MeJA-induced accumulation of sesquiterpene alkaloids in D. officinale.

BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS) has a 80% lifetime risk of developing colorectal 
cancer and metachronous cancer. No studies have examined the quality adjusted 
life expectancy after SEG or TAC for LS patients, which this study was aiming 
for. If TAC offers a higher quality adjusted life year (QALY) to SEG in LS 
patients, preoperative diagnosis of LS is critical as it alters the recommended 
surgical procedure.
METHODS: A Markov decision tree was constructed using Treeage software to 
compare QALY of LS patients following SEG or TAC. Probabilities, cost, and 
utility were obtained from literature. Cost-effectiveness analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: TAC dominates SEG as both the life-saving and cost-saving strategy. TAC 
dominated SEG on QALY (17.80 vs 17.13 QALY) for a cohort of LS patients 
diagnosed at an average of 30 year old and followed every 2 years after initial 
surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that TAC as the primary surgical option for LS patients 
diagnosed with Stage I-III colon cancer is cost-effective. Further 
cost-effectiveness study is recommended to include extra-colonic malignancies in 
LS patients.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive disease 
of the pulmonary vasculature. Recent advances in pharmacotherapy improved life 
expectancy of PAH patients and, thus, signified the role of general measures, 
including diet, in the management of the disease.
METHODS: In the present narrative review we will briefly summarize information 
about current and novel PAH therapies and analyze preclinical evidence on the 
influence of certain nutrients on the pathogenesis of PAH.
RESULTS: Although the evidence on the role of dietary deficiencies in the 
development and progression of PAH in humans is limited, preclinical studies 
demonstrate that dietary components such as quercetin, genistein, n-3 PUFAs, 
vitamin D, coenzyme Q10 and resveratrol may influence various aspects of PAH 
pathobiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research on the role of diet in PAH is needed. Taking into 
account pleiotropic and subtle effects of dietary constituents as well as the 
rare and severe nature of PAH, clinical studies on the disease-specific 
nutritional patterns rather than on single dietary components may help to reveal 
if diet can be an important tool to improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in 
PAH.

Pisiformectomy is the gold standard treatment for pisotriquetral arthritis 
resistant to conservative treatment. We evaluated the long-term clinical and 
functional outcomes after pisiformectomy in resistant pisotriquetral arthritis 
cases. We retrospectively evaluated 11 patients (12 wrists), mean age of 59 
years (49-69) treated by pisiformectomy using a standardized surgical technique. 
Pisiformectomy was performed for primary osteoarthritis in 10 cases, for 
post-traumatic osteoarthritis in 1 case and for pisotriquetral instability in 1 
case. The clinical and functional evaluation was carried out by an independent 
examiner. Mean time to review was 90 months (63-151). Pain on a Visual Analog 
Scale (/10) decreased significantly to 1.1 from 6.8 preoperatively. Mean range 
of motion was 79° in flexion, 61.5° in extension, 18° in ulnar deviation and 36° 
in radial deviation. Mean grip strength of the operated wrist was 86% of the 
non-operated wrist. Functional scores significantly improved with a gain of 40 
points for the QuickDASH and 53 points for the PRWE. Based on this long-term 
follow-up study, pisiformectomy seems to alleviate wrist pain and improve the 
quality of life in a low-demand population with pisotriquetral osteoarthritis 
resistant to conservative treatment. When compared to the pisotriquetral 
arthrodesis, pisiformectomy is easier to perform, allows quicker mobilization of 
the wrist and leads to good functional outcomes.

Many studies have found evidence of socioeconomic differences in breast cancer 
survival. This study aimed to quantify the impact of removing differences in 
stage distribution and stage-specific relative survival between education groups 
in Swedish women with breast cancer. Using information from a breast cancer 
research database, the study population contained 62 121 women diagnosed with 
breast cancer in three healthcare regions of Sweden from 1992 to 2012. The loss 
in expectation of life and life years lost due to breast cancer were estimated 
using flexible parametric relative survival models by education group and age at 
diagnosis. The potential gain in life years and postponable deaths were 
calculated by applying the 1) stage distribution, 2) stage-specific relative 
survival, and 3) both stage distribution and stage-specific relative survival of 
the high education group to the low and medium education groups. For a cohort of 
around 3500 women diagnosed with breast cancer residing in three Swedish 
healthcare regions in a typical calendar year, we estimated that removing stage 
differences would postpone an additional 25 deaths at five years after 
diagnosis, and result in a gain of approximately 573 life years. Alternatively, 
if stage-specific breast cancer survival could be equated, approximately 692 
life years could be saved and an additional 26 deaths could be postponed five 
years after diagnosis. Results such as these can help guide decisions on 
interventions intended to minimise socioeconomic differences in breast cancer 
outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of 
intensified breast cancer (BC) screening for women with a BRCA1/2 mutation aged 
60-74. Simulated strategies were: (0) annual mammography as reference, (1) 
alternating annual mammography and MRI for women with dense breasts only; (2) 
addition of annual MRI for women with dense breasts only; (3) addition of annual 
MRI for all women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validated micro-simulation model of invasive BC was 
updated and validated for interval BC rates and tumor size distribution. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of all three intensified strategies 
were compared to the next best strategy and stratified for BRCA1 and BRCA2. 
Discount rates for costs and life years gained (LYG) were 1.5% and 4% for the 
Dutch situation; 3% and 3% for international comparison. A threshold of €20,000 
per LYG was applied.
RESULTS: All intensified strategies showed more detected BCs and LYG, reduced BC 
deaths, and increased false positives. The Dutch discounted ICER of intensified 
strategy 1 compared to annual mammography was €38,000 per LYG in BRCA1 mutation 
carriers and €18,000 per LYG in BRCA2 mutation carriers. Further intensified 
strategies showed an ICER above the threshold when compared to this strategy. 
With international discount rate, the ICERs of all intensified strategies were 
above the threshold.
CONCLUSION: Of the three alternative strategies, only alternating annual MRI and 
mammography for BRCA2 mutation carriers and dense breasts aged 60-75 is 
cost-effective compared to annual mammography. For BRCA1 mutation carriers, none 
of the alternative strategies is cost-effective compared to the next best 
strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Optimal management of distal radius fractures in adults remains 
controversial. Previous evidence and current clinical guidelines tell us that, 
if a closed reduction of a dorsally displaced fracture is possible, Kirschner 
wires (K-wires) are the preferred form of surgical fixation. However, the 
question remains whether there is any need to perform surgical fixation 
following a successful closed reduction, or is a simple plaster cast as 
effective? This is the protocol for a randomised controlled trial of 
manipulation and surgical fixation with K-wires versus manipulation and casting 
in the treatment of dorsally displaced distal radius fractures.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Adult patients with an acute dorsally displaced fracture 
of the distal radius are potentially eligible to take part. Prior to surgery, 
baseline demographic data, radiographs, data on pain/function using the 
Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation Score (PRWE) and health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) using the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) will be collected. A 
randomisation sequence, stratified by centre, intra-articular extension of the 
fracture and age, will be administered via a secure web-based service. Each 
patient will be randomly allocated to either 'manipulation and surgical fixation 
with K-wires' or 'manipulation and plaster casting'. A clinical assessment, 
radiographs and records of early complications will be recorded at 6 weeks. PRWE 
and HRQoL outcome data will be collected at 3, 6 and 12 months 
post-randomisation. Further information will be requested with regard to 
healthcare resource use and any complications.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The National Research Ethic Committee approved this 
study on 6 October 2016 (16/SC/0462).The National Institute for Health Research 
Health Technology Assessment monograph and a manuscript to a peer-reviewed 
journal will be submitted on completion of the trial. The results of this trial 
will substantially inform clinical practice on the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of the treatment of this injury.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of eculizumab on perceived fatigue in patients 
with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive, refractory, generalized 
myasthenia gravis (MG) using the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders 
(Neuro-QOL) Fatigue subscale, and to evaluate correlations between improvements 
in Neuro-QOL Fatigue and other clinical endpoints.
METHODS: Neuro-QOL Fatigue, MG Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL), Quantitative 
MG (QMG), and the 15-item MG Quality of Life (MG-QOL15) scales were administered 
during the phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled REGAIN study (eculizumab, 
n = 62; placebo, n = 63) and subsequent open-label extension (OLE). Data were 
analyzed using repeated-measures models. Correlations between changes in 
Neuro-QOL Fatigue and in MG-ADL, QMG, and MG-QOL15 scores were determined at 
REGAIN week 26.
RESULTS: At REGAIN week 26, eculizumab-treated patients showed significantly 
greater improvements in Neuro-QOL Fatigue scores than placebo-treated patients 
(consistent with improvements in MG-ADL, QMG, and MG-QOL15 scores previously 
reported in REGAIN). Improvements with eculizumab were sustained through OLE 
week 52. Correlations between Neuro-QOL Fatigue and MG-QOL15, MG-ADL, and QMG 
scores were strong for eculizumab-treated patients at REGAIN week 26, and 
strong, moderate, and weak, respectively, for placebo-treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, eculizumab was associated with improvements 
in perceived fatigue that strongly correlated with improvements in MG-specific 
outcome measures. Trial ID Registration: NCT01997229, NCT02301624.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A previous analysis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related 
healthcare costs in Switzerland found that the annual healthcare costs of 
untreated HCV infection (excluding antiviral treatment) could increase by more 
than 25 million Swiss francs (CHF) between 2013 and 2030. Since that 
publication, highly efficacious direct-acting antiviral therapies (DAAs) have 
become available, making HCV elimination a possibility. This analysis quantifies 
the clinical and economic burden of HCV intervention strategies over the next 15 
years.
METHODS: A model was developed to estimate the future clinical and economic 
burden of HCV infection if patients are diagnosed and treated according to a 
historical paradigm (historical base case), or at higher levels without 
treatment reimbursement restrictions (Scenario 1). The infected population was 
tracked by age- and sex-defined cohorts, and associated direct medical costs 
(healthcare, screening, diagnostics and treatment) and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) were calculated. Direct cost savings and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated to assess the economic impact of 
each scenario. Additionally, we generated a net-zero cost scenario (Scenario 2), 
assuming the same treatment paradigm as Scenario 1 but at the treatment price 
that would break even by 2031.
RESULTS: In the historical base case, annual direct costs are projected to 
decrease from 150 million (95% UI: 132&ndash;170 million) CHF in 2016 to 90 
million (95% UI: 65&ndash;111 million) CHF in 2031. Cumulative direct costs are 
projected to reach 1.7 billion (95% UI: 1.2&ndash;2.0 billion) CHF by 2031. In 
Scenario 1, annual direct costs first increased to 175 million CHF by 2018, 
before declining to 44 million CHF by 2031. Cumulative direct costs in this 
scenario are projected to reach 1.8 billion CHF by 2031. For Scenario 2, the 
treatment price needed to achieve break-even by 2031 considering only direct 
costs would be 27,900 CHF per patient. By 2031, Scenarios 1 and 2 would gain 
58,300 QALYs. In both scenarios, the ICER drops below the cost-effectiveness 
threshold of 78,000 CHF in 2018. Over the 15-year span, the ICER was determined 
to be 2,200 CHF for Scenario 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the number of patients treated and treating all fibrosis 
stages is cost-effective compared to the historical base case and could achieve 
break-even by 2031 at a price of 27,900 CHF.

With the successes of antiretroviral therapy, patients infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) living longer. Regarding this, the common diseases 
of HIV population (i.e., opportunistic infections) are now losing ground in 
front of metabolic alterations. This phenomenon is related to the delay in 
progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), making it so that 
patients live in a chronic inflammatory state which, combined with other 
mechanisms such infectious ones, cause metabolic diseases. Areas covered: 
Considering a high prevalence of metabolic alterations, the relationship between 
metabolic syndrome (MetS) with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver diseases as a major cause of 
death in the HIV-infected population, this paper aims to overview the mechanisms 
and prevalence of NAFLD and NASH as they relate to the developed metabolic 
diseases of HIV patients. Expert opinion: The pathways underlying MetS include 
the effects of HIV and ART on the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle. These 
mechanisms result in liver damage, consequently leading to NAFLD and its more 
severe form NASH. These conditions have increased in HIV-infected population in 
recent years and since their life expectancy is improving it is important to be 
ready to attend their new emerging diseases.

PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of multifocal intraocular lenses 
(IOLs) compared to that of monofocal IOLs from a societal and health care sector 
perspective.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed that simulated patients who received 
either multifocal or monofocal IOLs during cataract surgery. Postoperatively, 
patients could experience spectacle dependence, glare, and haloes. 
Cost-effectiveness was determined by measuring the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the incremental cost in dollars per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Treatments with an ICER below the 
standard willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY were considered cost 
effective. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were used to evaluate model sensitivity to cost, utilities, and other model 
inputs.
RESULTS: Multifocal IOLs were associated with a 0.71 QALY increase at an 
increased cost of $3,415 compared with monofocal IOLs, leading to an ICER of 
$4,805/QALY from the societal and health care sector perspectives. The 
cost-effectiveness model was most sensitive to patient age, probability of 
spectacle dependence with multifocal IOLs and monofocal IOLs, and the disutility 
of glasses. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found multifocal IOLs to be the 
cost-effective option compared with monofocal IOLs 99.9% of the time at a WTP 
threshold of $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: From a societal and health care perspective, multifocal IOLs would 
be considered a cost-effective strategy compared to monofocal IOLs for patients 
who desire a higher chance to be spectacle-free. However, more studies need to 
be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy of multifocal IOLs.

OBJECTIVES: Everyone deserves a long and healthy life, but in reality, health 
outcomes differ across populations. We use results from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017) to report patterns in the burden of diseases, 
injuries, and risks at the global, regional, national, and subnational level, 
and by sociodemographic index (SDI), from 1990 to 2017.
DESIGN: GBD 2017 undertook a systematic analysis of published studies and 
available data providing information on prevalence, incidence, remission, and 
excess mortality. We computed prevalence, incidence, mortality, life expectancy, 
healthy life expectancy, years of life lost due to premature mortality, years 
lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years with 95% uncertainty 
intervals for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 
countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries from 1990 
to 2017. We also computed SDI, a summary indicator combining measures of income, 
education, and fertility.
RESULTS: There were wide disparities in the burden of disease by SDI, with 
smaller burdens in affluent countries and in specific regions within countries. 
Select diseases and risks, such as drug use disorders, high blood pressure, high 
body mass index, diet, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, and alcohol use 
disorders warrant increased global attention and indicate a need for greater 
investment in prevention and treatment across the life course.
CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers need a comprehensive picture of what risks and causes 
result in disability and death. The GBD provides the means to quantify health 
loss: these findings can be used to examine root causes of disparities and 
develop programs to improve health and health equity.

Increasing life expectancy is associated with increased cancer incidence, yet 
the effect of cancer and anti-cancer treatment on elderly patients and their 
immune systems is not well understood. Declining T cell function with aging in 
response to infection and vaccination is well documented, however little is 
known about aged T cell responses to tumor antigens during cancer progression or 
how these responses are modulated by standard chemotherapy. We examined T cell 
responses to cancer in aged mice using AE17sOVA mesothelioma in which ovalbumin 
(OVA) becomes a 'spy' tumor antigen containing one dominant (SIINFEKL) and two 
subdominant (KVVRFDKL and NAIVFKGL) epitopes. Faster progressing tumors in 
elderly (22-24 months, cf. 60-70 human years) relative to young (2-3 months, 
human 15-18 years) mice were associated with increased pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and worsened cancer cachexia. Pentamer staining and an in-vivo 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay showed that whilst elderly mice generated a 
greater number of CD8+ T cells recognizing all epitopes, they exhibited a 
profound loss of function in their ability to lyse targets expressing the 
dominant, but not subdominant, epitopes compared to young mice. Chemotherapy was 
less effective and more toxic in elderly mice however, similar to young mice, 
chemotherapy expanded CTLs recognizing at least one subdominant epitope in 
tumors and draining lymph nodes, yet treatment efficacy still required CD8+ T 
cells. Given the significant dysfunction associated with elderly CTLs 
recognizing dominant epitopes, our data suggest that responses to subdominant 
tumor epitopes may become important when elderly hosts with cancer are treated 
with chemotherapy.

New health technologies often yield health benefits, but often at a high cost. 
In Australia, the processes for public reimbursement of high-cost 
pharmaceuticals and medical devices are different, potentially resulting in 
inequity in support for new therapies. We explore how reimbursement is different 
for medical devices compared with pharmaceuticals, including whether higher 
cost-effectiveness thresholds are accepted for pharmaceuticals. A literature 
review identified the challenges of economic evaluations for medical devices 
compared with pharmaceuticals. We used the ventricular assist device as a case 
study to highlight specific features of medical device funding in Australia. We 
used existing guidelines to evaluate whether ventricular assist devices would 
fulfil the requirements for the "Life-Saving Drugs Program", which is usually 
reserved for expensive life-extending pharmaceutical treatments of serious and
