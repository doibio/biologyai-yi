sarcoma of the extremity (eUPS) from the PERSARC collaborative group aimed to 
achieve a more personalized multimodality treatment approach for primary eUPS in 
elderly patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study including primary 
high-grade eUPS surgically treated with curative intent between 2000 and 2016. 
Overall survival (OS), local recurrence (LR) and distant metastasis (DM) curves 
were calculated by Kaplan Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were 
used to determine the effect of radiotherapy.
RESULTS: From a total of 2511 patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma (eSTS) 
of the PERSARC study collaborative; 703 patients with eUPS were included in this 
study. In elderly patients with eUPS 5-year OS, LR and DM were 35.4 (95%CI 
29.3-42.8), 17.7 (95%CI 12.7-22.6) and 24.6 (95%CI 19.1-30.1). eUPS was 
significantly less treated with radiotherapy compared with other eSTS, 
especially in elderly patients. Patients with R1-R2 margins treated with 
radiotherapy had about half the risk of developing LR compared with patients 
treated without radiotherapy (HR = 0.454, p = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with eUPS were less often treated with radiotherapy 
and showed higher LR. Nowadays, given an increasing life expectancy in elderly 
patients, multimodality treatment should be considered.

Fresh fruits are prioritized needs in order to fulfill the required health 
benefits for human beings. However, some essential fruits are highly perishable 
with very short shelf-life during storage because of microbial growth and 
infections. Thus improvement of fruits shelf-life is a serious concern for their 
proper utlization without generation of huge amount of fruit-waste. Among 
various methods employed in extension of fruits shelf-life, design and 
fabrication of edible nanocoatings with antimicrobial activities have attracted 
considerable interest because of their enormous potential, novel functions, 
eco-friendly nature and good durability. In recent years, scientific communities 
have payed increased attention in the development of advanced antimicrobial 
edible coatings to prolong the postharvest shelf-life of fruits using 
hydrocolloids. In this review, we attempted to highlight the technical 
breakthrough and recent advancements in development of edible fruit coating by 
the application of various types of agro-industrial residues and different 
active nanomaterials incorporated into the coatings and their effects on 
shelf-life of perishable fruits. Improvements in highly desired functions such 
as antioxidant/antimicrobial activities and mechanical properties of edible 
coating to significantly control the gases (O2/CO2) permeation by the 
incorporation of nanoscale natural materials as well as metal nanoparticles are 
reviewed and discussed. In addition, by compiling recent knowledge, advantages 
of coatings on fruits for nutritional security during COVID-19 pandemic are also 
summarized along with the scientific challenges and insights for future 
developments in fabrication of engineered nanocoatings.

Uveal melanoma is the most common primary ocular neoplasm in adults, with many 
patients ending up developing liver metastasis and facing a significant 
reduction of their life expectancy due to the lack of efficient treatments. 
Artemisinin is an antimalarial drug that has been widely used in the clinic and 
whose anticancer properties have also been described. Its reported safety, 
affordability, and ability to reach the ocular tissues point that it has a 
potential therapeutic agent against uveal melanoma. In the present study, we 
found that a subantimalaria dosage of artemisinin significantly attenuated the 
migration and invasion potential of uveal melanoma cells, in a 
concentration-dependent manner. Assessment of the mechanisms underlying 
artemisinin anticancer action revealed that its use dramatically reduced the 
phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in UM cells. Further inhibition of PI3K 
signaling, using LY294002, or of mTOR, by rapamycin, blocked the migration and 
invasion of UM cells similarly to artemisinin. In contrast, AKT or mTOR 
activator (Sc79 and MHY1485, respectively) attenuated the inhibitory effect of 
artemisinin on the migration and invasion abilities of UM cells, further 
validating that artemisinin's anticancer effect is likely to be mediated via 
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Artemisinin also induced mitochondrial 
membrane potential loss and apoptosis of UM cells, having no significant toxic 
effect on normal retinal neuronal cells RGC-5 and epithelial cells D407. These 
findings and the reported safety of artemisinin's clinical dosage strongly 
suggest the therapeutic potential of artemisinin in the prevention and treatment 
of uveal melanomas.

OBJECTIVE: To formulate clinical consensus recommendations on the presentation, 
assessment, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in adults.
METHODS: Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used 
a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an 
evidence-informed position statement addressing nine key questions.
RESULTS: PHPT is a biochemical diagnosis. Serum calcium should be measured in 
patients with suggestive symptoms, reduced bone mineral density or minimal 
trauma fractures, and in those with renal stones. Other indications are detailed 
in the manuscript. In patients with hypercalcaemia, intact parathyroid hormone, 
25-hydroxy vitamin D, phosphate, and renal function should be measured. In 
established PHPT, assessment of bone mineral density, vertebral fractures, 
urinary tract calculi/nephrocalcinosis and quantification of urinary calcium 
excretion is warranted. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment and 
is warranted for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for 
asymptomatic patients without contraindications to surgery and with >10 years 
life expectancy. In patients who do not undergo surgery, we recommend annual 
evaluation for disease progression. Where the diagnosis is not clear or the 
risk-benefit ratio is not obvious, multidisciplinary discussion and formulation 
of a consensus management plan is appropriate. Genetic testing for familial 
hyperparathyroidism is recommended in selected patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These clinical consensus recommendations were developed to provide 
clinicians with contemporary guidance on the assessment and management of PHPT 
in adults. It is anticipated that improved health outcomes for individuals and 
the population will be achieved at a decreased cost to the community.

Prescribing Smartphone Apps for Physical Activity Promotion in Primary Care: 
Modeling Study of Health Gain and Cost Savings.

BACKGROUND: Inadequate physical activity is a substantial cause of health loss 
worldwide, and this loss is attributable to diseases such as coronary heart 
disease, diabetes, stroke, and certain forms of cancer.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the potential impact of the prescription of 
smartphone apps in primary care settings on physical activity levels, health 
gains (in quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), and health system costs in New 
Zealand (NZ).
METHODS: A proportional multistate lifetable model was used to estimate the 
change in physical activity levels and predict the resultant health gains in 
QALYs and health system costs over the remaining life span of the NZ population 
alive in 2011 at a 3% discount rate.
RESULTS: The modeled intervention resulted in an estimated 430 QALYs gained (95% 
uncertainty interval 320-550), with net cost savings of 2011 NZ $2.2 million 
(2011 US $1.5 million) over the remaining life span of the 2011 NZ population. 
On a per capita basis, QALY gains were generally larger in women than in men and 
larger in Māori than in non-Māori. The health impact and cost-effectiveness of 
the intervention were highly sensitive to assumptions on intervention uptake and 
decay. For example, the scenario analysis with the largest benefits, which 
assumed a 5-year maintenance of additional physical activity levels, delivered 
1750 QALYs and 2011 NZ $22.5 million (2011 US $15.1 million) in cost savings.
CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of smartphone apps for promoting physical activity 
in primary care settings is likely to generate modest health gains and cost 
savings at the population level in this high-income country. Such gains may 
increase with ongoing improvements in app design and increased health worker 
promotion of the apps to patients.

The males of many species of New World Phlebotomines produce volatile terpenoid 
chemicals, shown in Lutzomyia longipalpis s.l. to be sex/aggregation pheromones. 
Pheromone is produced by secretory cells which surround a cuticular reservoir 
which collects the pheromone and passes it through a cuticular duct to the 
surface of the insect. The pheromone then passes through specialised cuticular 
structures on the abdominal surface prior to evaporation. The shape and 
distribution of the specialised structures are highly diverse and differ 
according to species. In this study we used SEM to examine the interior 
cuticular pheromone collection and transport structures of 3 members of the Lu. 
longipalpis s.l. species complex and Migonemyia migonei. We found a new 
structure which we have called the manifold which appears to be a substantial 
extension of the interior tergal cuticle connected in-line with the cuticular 
duct and reservoir. The manifold of the Campo Grande member of the complex is 
longer and wider than the Jacobina member whereas the manifold of the Sobral 
member was shorter than both other members of the complex. Overall, the 
secretory apparatus of the Sobral member was smaller than the other two. The 
manifold of M. migonei was very different to those found in Lu. longipalpis s.l. 
and was positioned in a pit-like structure within the tergal cuticle. The 
secretory reservoir was connected by a short duct to the manifold. Differences 
in the size and shape of the manifold may be related to the chemical structure 
of the pheromone and may have taxonomic value. Examination of the interior 
cuticle by SEM may help to locate the secretory apparatus of vector species 
where pheromonal activity has been inferred from behavioural studies but the 
external secretory structures or pheromones have not yet been found.

The impact of psychological theory on the treatment of Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults: A scoping review.

Psychological theory and interpretation of research are key elements influencing 
clinical treatment development and design in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD). Research-based treatment recommendations primarily support 
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), an extension of the cognitive behavioural 
theory, which promotes a deficit-focused characterisation of ADHD and 
prioritises symptom reduction and cognitive control of self-regulation as 
treatment outcomes. A wide variety of approaches have developed to improve ADHD 
outcomes in adults, and this review aimed to map the theoretical foundations of 
treatment design to understand their impact. A scoping review and analysis were 
performed on 221 documents to compare the theoretical influences in research, 
treatment approach, and theoretical citations. Results showed that despite 
variation in the application, current treatments characterise ADHD from a single 
paradigm of cognitive behavioural theory. A single theoretical perspective is 
limiting research for effective treatments for ADHD to address ongoing issues 
such as accommodating context variability and heterogeneity. Research into 
alternative theoretical characterisations of ADHD is recommended to provide 
treatment design opportunities to better understand and address symptoms.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Jun 04;(6):CD009191.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a group of disorders characterized by 
deformation of erythrocytes. Renal damage is a frequent complication in sickle 
cell disease as a result of long-standing anemia and disturbed circulation 
through the renal medullary capillaries. Due to the improvement in life 
expectancy of people with sickle cell disease, there has been a corresponding 
significant increase in the incidence of renal complications. Microalbuminuria 
and proteinuria are noted to be a strong predictor of subsequent renal failure. 
There is extensive experience and evidence with angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors over many years in a variety of clinical situations for 
patients who do not have sickle cell disease, but their effect in people with 
this disease is unknown. It is common practice to administer ACE inhibitors for 
sickle nephropathy due to their renoprotective properties; however, little is 
known about their effectiveness and safety in this setting. This is an update of 
a Cochrane Review first published in 2013 and 2015.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor administration in 
people with sickle cell disease for decreasing intraglomerular pressure, 
microalbuminuria and proteinuria and to to assess the safety of ACE inhibitors 
as pertains to their adverse effects.
SEARCH METHODS: The authors searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic 
Disorders Group's Hameoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references 
identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of 
relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most 
recent search: 18 October 2021. We also searched clinical trial registries. Date 
of the most recent search: 22 August 2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of ACE 
inhibitors designed to reduce microalbuminuria and proteinuria in people with 
sickle cell disease compared to either placebo or standard treatment regimen.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently applied the inclusion 
criteria in order to select studies for inclusion in the review. Two authors 
assessed the risk of bias of studies and extracted data and the third author 
verified these assessments.
MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies were identified through the searches. Six studies 
were excluded. The included study randomized 22 participants (7 males and 15 
females) having proteinuria or microalbuminuria with sickle cell disease and 
treated the participants for six months (median length of follow up of three 
months) with captopril or placebo. Overall, the certainty of the evidence 
provided in this review was very low, since most risk of bias domains were 
judged to have either an unclear or a high risk of bias. Because of this, we are 
uncertain whether captopril makes any difference, in total urinary albumin 
excretion (at six months) as compared to the placebo group, although it yielded 
a mean difference of -49.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) -124.10 to 26.10) or 
in the absolute change score, although it yielded a mean difference of -63.00 
(95% CI -93.78 to -32.22). At six months albumin excretion in the captopril 
group was noted to decrease from baseline by a mean (standard deviation) of 45 
(23) mg/day and the placebo group was noted to increase by 18 (45) mg/day. Serum 
creatinine and potassium levels were reported constant throughout the study 
(very low-certainty evidence). The potential for inducing hypotension should be 
highlighted; the study reported a decrease of 8 mmHg in systolic pressure and 5 
mmHg in diastolic and mean blood pressure (very low-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be 
very low. The included study selectively reported its results, was not powered 
to detect a group difference, should it exist, and otherwise did not offer 
enough information to allow us to judge the bias inherent in the study. 
Indirectness (in relation to the limited age and type of population included) 
and imprecision (wide confidence intervals around the effect estimate) were 
observed. More long-term studies involving multiple centers and larger cohorts 
using a randomized-controlled design are warranted, especially among the 
pediatric age group. Detailed reporting of each outcome measure is necessary to 
allow a clear cut interpretation in a systematic review. One of the difficulties 
encountered in this review was the lack of detailed data reported in the 
included study. Overall, we judged the certainty of this evidence to be very 
low.

Maintaining genomic integrity and stability is crucial for life; yet, no 
tissue-driven mechanism that robustly safeguards the epithelial genome has been 
discovered. Epidermal stem cells (EpiSCs) continuously replenish the stratified 
layers of keratinocytes that protect organisms against various environmental 
stresses. To study the dynamics of DNA-damaged cells in tissues, we devised an 
in vivo fate tracing system for EpiSCs with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and 
demonstrated that those cells exit from their niches. The clearance of EpiSCs 
with DSBs is caused by selective differentiation and delamination through the 
DNA damage response (DDR)-p53-Notch/p21 axis, with the downregulation of ITGB1. 
Moreover, concomitant enhancement of symmetric cell divisions of surrounding 
stem cells indicates that the selective elimination of cells with DSBs is 
coupled with the augmented clonal expansion of intact stem cells. These data 
collectively demonstrate that tissue autonomy through the dynamic coupling of 
cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms coordinately maintains the 
genomic quality of the epidermis.

BACKGROUND: Clonorchiasis is attributed to the ingestion of raw freshwater fish 
harboring Clonorchis sinensis. Morbidity control is targeted through the 
administration of antihelminthics. This study modelled the cost yield indicated 
by effectiveness and utility of different treatment strategies against 
clonorchiasis.
METHODS: About 1000 participants were enrolled from each of 14 counties selected 
from four provincial-level administrative divisions namely Guangxi, Guangdong, 
Heilongjiang and Jilin in 2017. Fecal examination was adopted to detect C. 
sinensis infection, while behavior of ingesting raw freshwater fish was 
enquired. Counties were grouped into four categories based on prevalence, namely 
low prevalence group (< 1%), moderate prevalence group (1-9.9%), high prevalence 
group (10-19.9%) and very high prevalence group (≥ 20%), while population were 
divided into three subgroups, namely children aged below 14 years old, adult 
female and adult male both aged over 14 years old. The average of cost 
effectiveness indicated by the cost to treat single infected cases with C. 
sinensis and of cost utility indicated by the cost to avoid per 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by C. sinensis infection was 
calculated. Comparisons were performed between three treatment schedules, namely 
individual treatment, massive and selective chemotherapy, in which different 
endemic levels and populations were considered.
RESULTS: In selective chemotherapy strategy, the cost to treat single infected 
case in very high prevalence group was USD 10.6 in adult male, USD 11.6 in adult 
female, and USD 13.2 in children. The cost increased followed the decrease of 
endemic level. In massive chemotherapy strategy, the cost per infected case in 
very high prevalence group was USD 14.0 in adult male, USD 17.1 in adult female, 
USD 45.8 in children, which were also increased when the endemic level 
decreased. In individual treatment strategy, the cost was USD 12.2 in adult 
male, USD 15.0 in adult female and USD 41.5 in children in very high prevalence 
group; USD 19.2 in adult male, USD 34.0 in adult female, and USD 90.1 in 
children in high prevalence group; USD 30.4 in adult male, USD 50.5 in adult 
female and over USD 100 in children in moderate prevalence group; and over USD 
400 in any population in low prevalence group. As to cost utility, the 
differences by treatment strategies, populations and endemic levels were similar 
to those in cost effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Both cost effectiveness and cost utility indicators are highly 
impacted by the prevalence and population, as well as the treatment schedules. 
Adults especially men in the areas with a prevalence over 10% should be 
prioritized, in which selective chemotherapy was best and massive chemotherapy 
was also cost effective. In moderate endemic areas, the yield is not ideal, but 
selective chemotherapy for adult male may also be adopted. In low endemic areas, 
all strategies were high costly and new strategies need to be developed.

This study was a cost-effectiveness analysis of intensive blood pressure (BP) 
control among hypertensive patients in Korea. We constructed a Markov model 
comparing intensive versus standard BP control treatment and calculated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The study population consisted of 
hypertensive patients over 50 years old with systolic blood pressures (SBPs) 
exceeding 140 mmHg and at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Treatment 
alternatives included lowering the SBP below 120 mmHg (intensive) and 140 mmHg 
(standard) for target BP. We assumed five scenarios with different medication 
adherence. The effectiveness variable was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
and costs included medical costs related to hypertension (HT), complications, 
and nonmedical costs. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to 
confirm the robustness of the results of this study. Scenario 5, with 100% 
medication adherence, showed the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of $1,373 USD, followed by scenario 1 (first 15 years: 62.5%, 16-30 
years: 65.2%, after 30 years: 59.5%), scenario 2 (first five years: 62.5% 
decrease by 5% every five years), and scenario 3 (first 10 years: 62.5% decrease 
by 10% every 10 years). The ICERs in all scenarios were lower than the 
willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $9,492-$32,907 USD in Korea. Tornado 
analysis showed that the ICERs were changed greatly according to stroke 
incidence. Intensive treatment of HT prevents cardiovascular disease (CVD); 
therefore, intensive treatment is more cost-effective than standard treatment 
despite the consumption of more health resources. ICERs are considerably changed 
according to medication adherence, confirming the importance of patient 
adherence to treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral aneurysms in pediatrics represent < 4% of the total of this 
condition, and their rupture represents 10-23% mortality. Aneurysms have been 
associated with infections, head injuries, sickle cell anemia, cardiovascular 
diseases, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and connective tissue 
diseases. Their clinical presentation includes severe headache, seizures, 
motor-sensory deficits, and death due to subarachnoid and intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage.
CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 12-year-old female patient who presented 
with a sudden intense headache; after 72 hours, generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures were observed. At the hospital, she was stabilized with antiepileptic 
drugs and analgesics. A simple head computed tomography scan showed 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe and subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. The study was complemented with a cerebral angiotomography, which 
revealed an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. The pediatric 
neurosurgeon evaluated the case, and management in the pediatric intensive care 
unit was decided. Two weeks after the stroke, the aneurysm was clipped and 
excluded. The patient developed adequate clinical evolution and resolution of 
initial symptoms, resuming her daily activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric cerebral aneurysms differ from their adult counterparts, 
mainly in their etiology and evolution. In addition, pediatric patients have a 
longer life expectancy. Aneurysm clipping and neurological endovascular therapy 
have shown similar results.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: Los aneurismas cerebrales en pediatría representan 
menos del 4% del total de estos padecimientos, aunque su rotura tiene una 
mortalidad del 10-23%. Se han asociado con infecciones, traumatismos 
craneoencefálicos, anemia de células falciformes, enfermedades cardiovasculares, 
enfermedades autoinmunitarias, inmunodeficiencias y enfermedades del tejido 
conectivo. Su presentación clínica se manifiesta con cefalea intensa, crisis 
convulsivas, déficit motor-sensitivo y muerte debida a la hemorragia 
subaracnoidea e intraparenquimatosa.
CASO CLÍNICO: Se describe el caso de una paciente de 12 años que presentó 
cefalea súbita intensa; a las 72 horas se agregaron crisis convulsivas 
tónico-clónicas generalizadas. En el hospital se estabilizó con fármacos 
antiepilépticos y analgésicos. Se le realizó una tomografía de cráneo simple que 
evidenció hemorragia intraparenquimatosa en el lóbulo frontal derecho y 
hemorragia subaracnoidea. El estudio se complementó con una angiotomografía 
cerebral, la cual reveló un aneurisma de la arteria comunicante anterior. Fue 
valorada por el neurocirujano pediatra y se decidió su manejo en la unidad de 
terapia intensiva pediátrica. A las 2 semanas de iniciado el evento se realizó 
clipaje y exclusión del aneurisma. La paciente tuvo una adecuada evolución 
clínica y resolución de los síntomas iniciales, retomando sus actividades de la 
vida diaria.
CONCLUSIONES: Los aneurismas cerebrales en pediatría difieren de su contraparte 
en los adultos, principalmente en su etiología y evolución, ya que los pacientes 
pediátricos tienen mayor expectativa de vida. El clipaje del aneurisma y la 
terapia endovascular neurológica han mostrado resultados similares.

Hedyotis diffusa Willd. (H. diffusa), a kind of traditional Chinese medicine, 
has been evaluated to potential display antioxidant and anti-aging effects 
in vitro experiments. In this work, we investigated the effects on lifespan and 
stress resistance of the butanol extract from H. diffusa (NHD) in vivo using a 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model. The phytochemicals of NHD were 
identified by UPLC-ESI-qTOF-MS/MS method. NHD-treated wild-type N2 worms showed 
an increase in survival time under both normal and stress conditions. Meanwhile, 
NHD promoted the healthspan of nematodes by stimulating growth and development, 
reducing the deposition of age pigment, increasing the activities of superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase dismutase (GSH-Px), and decreasing 
the level of ROS without impairing fertility. Moreover, the upregulating of the 
expression of daf-16, gst-4, sod-3, hsp12.6 genes and the downregulating of the 
expression of daf-2 were involved in the NHD-mediated lifespan extension. 
Finally, the increasing of the expression of GST-4::GFP in CL2166 transgenic 
nematodes and the life-span-extending activity of NHD was completely abolished 
in daf-2 and daf-16 mutants further revealed that the potential roles for these 
genes in NHD-induced longevity in C. elegans. Collectively, our findings suggest 
that NHD may have an active effect in healthy aging and age-related diseases.

Ischemic stroke caused by atherosclerosis (AS) poses a serious threat to human 
life expectancy and quality. With the development of genome-wide association 
studies, the association of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) expression of 
atheromatous plaques with ischemic stroke in large arteries has been revealed, 
but the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon have not been elucidated. In 
this study, we explored the effect of HDAC9 on the P38 mitogen activated protein 
kinase (P38 MAPK), a classic cellular inflammation-related pathway, by knocking 
down HDAC9 in vascular endothelial cells with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and 
found that HDAC9 may mediate oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced 
inflammatory injury in vascular endothelial cells by regulating the 
phosphorylation level of P38 MAPK to lead to AS. It can be seen that HDAC9 may 
be a target to control the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. In follow-up 
experiments, it was verified that sodium valproate (SVA), as a HDAC9 inhibitor, 
can indeed antagonize the inflammatory damage of vascular endothelial cells, as 
well as SB203580, which is a P38 MAPK inhibitor. It proves that SVA may be a 
potential drug for the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION: Fontan surgery is a palliative procedure performed in children 
with a functionally univentricular heart. Improvements in surgical technique 
over the past 30 years have increased life expectancy in this rare population. 
However, the epidemiology of persons living with Fontan is poorly understood. 
This study aimed to estimate the 2020 and 2030 prevalence of persons living with 
a Fontan circulation in 11 countries across the US, Europe, Australia and New 
Zealand, by procedure type: [atriopulmonary connection (AP), lateral tunnel 
total cavopulmonary connection (LT-TCPC) or extracardiac total cavopulmonary 
connection (EC-TCPC)]; and age group: [children (< 12 years), adolescents 
(12-17 years), and adults (≥ 18 years old)] by building an epidemiologic model.
METHODS: The annual number of Fontan surgeries by country in 2010-2020 were 
extracted from hospital or claims databases, via procedure codes. The 
epidemiology of persons living with Fontan was modelled by applying these 
surgery frequencies to mid-year populations from 1972 to 2020 and overlaying an 
uptake curve. A literature search identified: 30-day mortality rates, long-term 
survival, and median age at surgery. Averages of these estimates were inputted 
into the model to project prevalence in 2030.
RESULTS: The number of persons living with Fontan in 2020 across the 11 
countries was estimated to be 47,881 [66 people per million (ppm)], rising to 
59,777 (79 ppm) by 2030. In 2020, this population was 55% adults, 17% 
adolescents and 28% children shifting to 64%, 13% and 23%, respectively, in 
2030. Among all persons living with Fontan, 74%/18%/9% are estimated to have 
EC-TCPC/LT-TCPC/AP, respectively, in 2020, and 83%/14%/4% in 2030.
CONCLUSIONS: According to this epidemiology model, the Fontan population is 
growing, partly driven by increased survival rates with the more recent LT-TCPC 
and EC-TCPC procedures (compared with AP). The 2020/2030 prevalence of persons 
living with Fontan is 66/79 ppm.

Data on the global epidemiology of varicella-zoster virus infection (VZVI) is 
limited. This study aimed to investigate the burden of VZVI based on the global 
burden of disease study 2019 data. The age-standardized rates, including the 
incidence, death, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and the estimated 
annual percentage changes (EAPC) of VZVI were calculated to evaluate the disease 
burden of VZVI. The global numbers of incident and death cases due to VZVI were 
83 963 744 and 14 553, respectively. The age-standardized incidence rate of VZVI 
increased slightly all over the world, while the age-standardized death and 
DALYs rate decreased from 1990 to 2019 (EAPC = -2.31 and -1.61, respectively). 
The younger age (<5 years old) and older groups had the highest VZVI burden. The 
high sociodemographic index (SDI) region had the highest age-standardized 
incidence rates in 2019 (1236.28/100 000, 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
1156.66-1335.50) and the low SDI region had the lowest incidence 
(1111.24/100 000, 95% UI: 1040.46-1209.55). The age-standardized death and DALYs 
rate of VZVI decreased with the increase of SDI. Amongst the 21 geographical 
regions, the high-income Asia-Pacific (1269.08/100 000) region had the highest 
age-standardized incidence rate in 2019, while Sub-Saharan Africa had the 
highest age-standardized death and DALYs rate. The global incidence of VZVI has 
continued to increase in the past 3 decades, while the age-standardized death 
and DALYs rates have decreased. More attention should be paid to the younger and 
older population, as well as low SDI regions.

Managing asbestos streams in developing and transition countries is particularly 
challenging. Deficiencies are often present for adequate procedures for the 
management of asbestos waste; solid quality data or databases on the quantities 
of asbestos production and usage are missing and asbestos inventories or the 
registry of asbestos-related diseases following European Union (EU) or other 
regulations are not in place. This paper aims to develop a model for determining 
and assessing the quantity of asbestos in the built environment of a transition 
country. Quantities of asbestos products and life expectancy of those products 
were assessed to develop a model that forecasts flows and stocks of asbestos 
products and wastes. The overall objective is to evaluate the model and show the 
manifestation of asbestos in the waste stream in a case study on a country with 
a transition economy, such as Serbia. Results show that total quantities of 
asbestos fibre consumption are approximately 0.5 million tonnes; the largest 
amount of waste generation is expected in the 2020s. Therefore, it is necessary 
to prepare for the forthcoming quantities of waste by improving legal 
procedures, implementation of existing regulations, and provision of economic 
resources. An important link for the adequate management of asbestos waste is to 
raise public awareness of the dangers and importance of proper and timely 
disposal of asbestos products.

Increased population longevity could be influenced by early life factors. Some 
areas have long-lived populations, also in a historical perspective. We aimed to 
study these factors in Halland, an area with the highest life expectancy in 
Sweden. We collected archival data on gestational age and birth characteristics 
from 995 live singleton full-term births at the Halmstad Hospital, Halland, from 
the period 1936 to 1938 and compared these to 3364 births from three hospitals 
in nearby Scania for the period 1935-1945. In addition, data were obtained on 
maternal and offspring characteristics from the national Swedish Medical Birth 
Register during 1973-2013. The results show that when controlling for background 
maternal and offspring characteristics, mean birth weight (BW) and mean birth 
length were higher in Halland than in Scania, but the proportion of low birth 
weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA) was lower. However, mean BW for 
Halland did not differ from the rest of Sweden in recent years 2004-2013. We 
also conducted a mortality follow-up for children born in Scania, which showed 
that LBW, being born SGA, or short birth length reduced survival. In conclusion, 
the high mean life expectancy in Halland compared to the rest of Sweden could 
have been associated with beneficial early life factors influencing birth size 
in the past. In more recent decades the mean BW of Halland is not different from 
the national mean. Thus, longevity could be expected to become more equal to the 
national mean in the future.
