UI, 658,347 to 2,543,613). But the ASMR and the ASDR slightly decreased by 8.49% 
and 13.16%, respectively. The burden of road injury death attributable to high 
temperature remained high in low SDI and tropical regions. In addition, road 
transport infrastructure investment per inhabitant is associated with the burden 
of road injuries attributable to high temperature.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, the ASMR and ASDR for road injuries attributable to high 
temperature decreased from 1990 to 2019, but the absolute death and DALYs 
continued to increase. Thus, concerning global warming, implementation of 
prevention and interventions to reduce road injuries from heat exposure should 
be stressed globally.

OBJECTIVES: This study tackles several challenges of evaluating 
histology-independent treatments using entrectinib as an example. 
Histology-independent treatments are provided based on genetic marker(s) of 
tumors, regardless of the tumor type. We evaluated the lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of testing all patients for NTRK fusions and treating the 
positive cases with entrectinib compared with no testing and standard of care 
(SoC) for all patients.
METHODS: The health economic model consisted of a decision tree reflecting the 
NTRK testing phase followed by a microsimulation model reflecting treatment with 
either entrectinib or SoC. Efficacy of entrectinib was based on data from basket 
trials, whereas historical data from NTRK-negative patients were corrected for 
the prognostic value of NTRK fusions to model SoC.
RESULTS: "Testing" (testing for NTRK fusions, with subsequent entrectinib 
treatment in NTRK-positive patients and SoC in NTRK-negative patients) had 
higher per-patient quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs than "No 
testing" (SoC for all patients), with a difference of 0.0043 and €732, 
respectively. This corresponded to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of €169 957/QALY and, using a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
€80 000/QALY, an incremental net monetary benefit of -€388. When excluding the 
costs of genetic testing for NTRK fusions, the ICER was reduced to €36 290/QALY 
and the incremental net monetary benefit increased to €188.
CONCLUSIONS: When treatment requires the identification of a genetic marker, the 
associated costs and effects need to be accounted for. Because of the low 
prevalence of NTRK fusions, the number needed-to-test to identify patients 
eligible for entrectinib is large. Excluding the testing phase reduces the ICER 
substantially.

There are some contributions analyzing the censored medical datasets using 
modifications of the conventional lifetime distribution; however most of the 
said contributions did not considered the modification of the Weibull 
distribution (WD). The WD is an important lifetime model. Due to its prime 
importance in modeling life data, many researchers have proposed different 
modifications of WD. One of the most recent modifications of WD is Modified 
Weibull Extension distribution (MWED). However, the ability of MWED to model the 
censored medical data has not yet been explored in the literature. We have 
explored the suitability of the model in modeling censored medical datasets. The 
analysis has been carried out using Bayesian methods under different loss 
functions and informative priors. The approximate Bayes estimates have been 
computed using Lindley's approximation. Based on detailed simulation study and 
real life analysis, it has been concluded that Bayesian methods performed better 
as compared to maximum likelihood estimates. In case of small samples, the 
performance of Bayes estimates under ELF and informative prior was the best. 
However, in case of large samples, the choice of prior and loss function did not 
affect the efficiency of the results to a large extend. The MWED performed 
efficiently in modeling real censored datasets relating to survival times of the 
leukemia and bile duct cancer patients. The MWED was explored to be a very 
promising candidate model for modeling censored medical datasets.

BACKGROUND: With rapid economic development, the world's average life expectancy 
is increasing, leading to the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis worldwide. 
However, due to the complexity and high cost of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) examination, DXA has not been widely used to diagnose osteoporosis. In 
addition, studies have shown that the psoas index measured at the third lumbar 
spine (L3) level is closely related to bone mineral density (BMD) and has an 
excellent predictive effect on osteoporosis. Therefore, this study developed a 
variety of machine learning (ML) models based on psoas muscle tissue at the L3 
level of unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) to predict osteoporosis.
METHODS: Medical professionals collected the CT images and the clinical 
characteristics data of patients over 40 years old who underwent DXA and 
abdominal CT examination in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical 
University database from January 2017 to January 2021. Using 3D Slicer software 
based on horizontal CT images of the L3, the specialist delineated three layers 
of the region of interest (ROI) along the bilateral psoas muscle edges. The 
PyRadiomics package in Python was used to extract the features of ROI. Then 
Mann-Whitney U test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) algorithm were used to reduce the dimension of the extracted features. 
Finally, six machine learning models, Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), random forest 
(RF), logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Gradient boosting 
machine (GBM), and Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were applied to train 
and validate these features to predict osteoporosis.
RESULTS: A total of 172 participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
for the study. 82 participants were enrolled in the osteoporosis group, and 90 
were in the non-osteoporosis group. Moreover, the two groups had no significant 
differences in age, BMI, sex, smoking, drinking, hypertension, and diabetes. 
Besides, 826 radiomic features were obtained from unenhanced abdominal CT images 
of osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic patients. Five hundred fifty radiomic 
features were screened out of 826 by the Mann-Whitney U test. Finally, 16 
significant radiomic features were obtained by the LASSO algorithm. These 16 
radiomic features were incorporated into six traditional machine learning models 
(GBM, GNB, LR, RF, SVM, and XGB). All six machine learning models could predict 
osteoporosis well in the validation set, with the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUROC) values greater than or equal to 0.8. GBM is 
more effective in predicting osteoporosis, whose AUROC was 0.86, sensitivity 
0.70, specificity 0.92, and accuracy 0.81 in validation sets.
CONCLUSION: We developed six machine learning models to predict osteoporosis 
based on psoas muscle images of abdominal CT, and the GBM model had the best 
predictive performance. GBM model can better help clinicians to diagnose 
osteoporosis and provide timely anti-osteoporosis treatment for patients. In the 
future, the research team will strive to include participants from multiple 
institutions to conduct external validation of the ML model of this study.

Economic evaluations in the healthcare are used to assess economic efficiency of 
pharmaceuticals and medical interventions such as diagnoses and medical 
procedures. This study introduces the main concepts of economic evaluation 
across its key steps: planning, outcome and cost calculation, modeling, 
cost-effectiveness results, uncertainty analysis, and decision-making. When 
planning an economic evaluation, we determine the study population, 
intervention, comparators, perspectives, time horizon, discount rates, and type 
of economic evaluation. In healthcare economic evaluations, outcomes include 
changes in mortality, the survival rate, life years, and quality-adjusted life 
years, while costs include medical, non-medical, and productivity costs. 
Model-based economic evaluations, including decision tree and Markov models, are 
mainly used to calculate the total costs and total effects. In 
cost-effectiveness or costutility analyses, cost-effectiveness is evaluated 
using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is the additional cost per 
one additional unit of effectiveness gained by an intervention compared with a 
comparator. All outcomes have uncertainties owing to limited evidence, diverse 
methodologies, and unexplained variation. Thus, researchers should review these 
uncertainties and confirm their robustness. We hope to contribute to the 
establishment and dissemination of economic evaluation methodologies that 
reflect Korean clinical and research environment and ultimately improve the 
rationality of healthcare policies.

Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is susceptible to infection by Peronophythora 
litchi post storage, which rapidly decreases the sensory and nutritional quality 
of the fruit. In this study, the effects of nanosilver (Ag-NP) solution 
treatment on the shelf life of litchi fruit and the inhibition of P. litchi were 
examined, and the underlying mechanisms were discussed. For investigations, we 
used one variety of litchi ('Feizixiao'), dipping it in different concentrations 
of Ag-NP solution after harvesting. Meanwhile, we treated P. litchi with 
different concentrations of Ag-NP solution. According to the data analysis, 
litchi treated with 400 μg/mL Ag-NPs and stored at 4 °C had the highest health 
rate and the lowest browning index among all the samples. In the same trend, 
treatment with 400 μg/mL Ag-NPs produced the best results for anthocyanin 
content, total soluble solids content, and titratable acidity content. 
Additionally, according to the results of the inhibition test, 800 μg/mL Ag-NP 
solution had a 94.97% inhibition rate against P. litchi. Within 2-10 h following 
exposure to 400 μg/mL Ag-NP solution, the contents of superoxide dismutase, 
peroxidase, and catalase in P. litchi gradually increased and peaked, followed 
by a gradual decline. At this time, the integrity of the cell membrane of P. 
litchi could be broken by Ag-NP solution, and the sporangia showed deformed germ 
tubes and abnormal shapes. Taken together, these results suggested that Ag-NP 
treatment inhibited respiration and P. litchi activity, which might attenuate 
litchi pericarp browning and prolong the shelf life of litchi. Accordingly, 
Ag-NPs could be used as an effective antistaling agent in litchi fruit and as an 
ecofriendly fungicide for the post-harvest control of litchi downy blight. This 
study provides new insights into the application of Ag-NP as an antistaling 
agent for fruit storage and as an ecofriendly fungicide.

Essential oils (EOs) from aromatic plants seem to have the potential to control 
several fungal pathogens and food contaminants. Botrytis cinerea is the main 
strawberry fruit contaminant causing high losses during storage. Here, thirteen 
EOs applied in the vapor phase were evaluated for their potential to inhibit the 
growth of three different strains of B. cinerea isolated from strawberry fruits. 
Eight EOs (lemongrass, litsea, lavender, peppermint, mint, petitgrain, sage, and 
thyme) were able to completely inhibit the growth of B. cinerea for 7 days when 
applied at a concentration of 625 μL·L-1. Four EOs with the lowest minimal 
inhibition concentrations (thyme, peppermint, lemongrass, and litsea) have been 
tested on strawberry fruits intentionally inoculated by B. cinerea. All four EOs 
showed high inhibition at a concentration of 250 or 500 μL·L-1, but only 
peppermint EO was able to completely inhibit B. cinerea lesion development at a 
concentration of 125 μL·L-1. The sensory evaluation of strawberries treated by 
EOs at a concentration 125 μL·L-1 resulted in a statistically significant 
decrease in taste, aftertaste, aroma, and overall quality. Lemongrass and litsea 
EOs scored better than thyme and peppermint ones, thus forming two viable 
methods for B. cinerea suppression and the extension of packed strawberries' 
shelf life.

In the present study, maize starch (MS), potato starch (PS), high-amylose maize 
starch (HAMS), and wheat starch (WS) were deep-fried in soybean oil that was 
continuously heated for 40 h under 180 °C. The thermodynamic and pasting 
properties of deep-fried starch samples were determined. The results suggested 
that starch−lipid complexes formed with the extension of frying oils’ usage; 
however, their number was not dependent on the frying oils’ life cycle. 
Importantly, the results of pasting properties revealed the following strength 
of intermolecular force in deep-fried starch samples: PS > MS > HAMS > WS. The 
results of XRD and FTIR analysis confirmed the formation of starch−lipid 
complexes during the deep-frying process. Furthermore, the results of the in 
vitro digestibility of deep-fried starch revealed that the formation of 
starch−lipid complexes inhibited the swelling of starch granules and prevented 
the entrance of amylase into the interior. Additionally, the results of the 
oxidation stability of deep-frying oil indicated that the formation of 
starch−lipid complexes did not alter the trend of lipid oxidation as an effect 
of the limited number of starch−lipid complexes. These results could have 
critical implications for the development of healthier deep-fried foods.

Resolving the species composition of a larval pool in a spawning ground can 
provide novel insights into regional fish stocks and can support the development 
of effective monitoring and conservation policies. However, it is challenging to 
identify fish larvae to species due to their high diversity and dramatic 
phenotypic changes over development. In this study, we collected fish larvae in 
the Dongta spawning ground (Guiping City, Guangxi Province, China) in the middle 
reaches of the Pearl River between May and August 2018. We used a DNA barcoding 
approach to determine the species composition of the larval pool. A total of 905 
larvae were chosen for molecular identification, of which 750 yielded 
high-quality barcoding sequences. Of these, 597 (≈79.6%), 151 (≈20.1%)/and 2 
(≈0.3%) were assigned to 28 species, 8 genera, and 1 subfamily using the Barcode 
of Life Data System and GenBank nucleotide databases, respectively. Among the 28 
identified species, 21 were cyprinids. Two species (Mugilogobius myxodermus and 
Pseudolaubuca engraulis) that were present only infrequently in previous adult 
surveys were abundant in the larval pool. Six invasive species were identified 
in the larval pool, implying that these species had successfully colonized the 
studied river section. Several migratory species common in the lower Pearl River 
were rare or absent in the investigated region, suggesting that dam construction 
in the Pearl River has had adverse effects on these migratory species. In 
summary, our study confirmed the applicability of DNA barcoding to studies of 
fish larval ecology and provided important reference data for fishery management 
and conservation in the Pearl River.

Progression of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) to muscle-invasive 
disease (MIBC) significantly worsens life expectancy. Its risk can be assessed 
by clinicopathological factors according to international guidelines. However, 
additional molecular markers are needed to refine and improve the prediction. 
Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to predict the progression of NMIBCs 
to MIBC by assessing p53 expression, polysomy of chromosome 17 (Chr17) and HER2 
status in the tissue specimens of the tumors of 90 NMIBC patients. Median 
follow-up was 77 months (range 2−158). Patients with Chr17 polysomy or HER2 gene 
amplification had a higher rate of disease progression (hazard ratio: 7.44; p < 
0.001 and 4.04; p = 0.033, respectively; univariate Cox regression). 
Multivariable Cox regression models demonstrated that the addition of either 
Chr17 polysomy or HER2 gene amplification status to the European Association of 
Urology (EAU) progression risk score increases the c-index (from 0.741/EAU/ to 
0.793 and 0.755, respectively), indicating that Chr17 polysomy/HER2 
amplification status information improves the accuracy of the EAU risk table in 
predicting disease progression. HER2/Chr17 in situ hybridization can be used to 
select non-progressive cases not requiring strict follow-up, by reclassifying 
non-HER2-amplified, non-polysomic NMIBCs from the high- and very high-risk 
groups of EAU to the intermediate-risk group.

(1) Background: With the increasing life expectancy in the Western world, an 
increasing number of old patients presents with spinal meningioma. Considering 
the benign nature of these tumors, the functional outcome remains of great 
importance, since more people reach old age in general conditions of well-being 
and satisfactory autonomy. (2) Methods: We conducted an international 
multicenter retrospective study to investigate demographic, clinical and 
radiological data in a population of elderly patients (≥75 years of age) 
undergoing surgery for SM from January 2000 to December 2020 in four European 
referral centers. The aim was to identify prognostic and predictive factors for 
a good postoperative functional outcome. (3) Results: 72 patients were included 
in the study. Complete tumor resection (Simpson I or II) was achieved in 67 
(95.7%) cases. Intraoperative complications were reported in 7 (9.9%) patients 
while postoperative complications were found in 12 (16.7%). An excellent general 
postoperative status (McCormick I and II) was achieved in 65.3%. Overall, 
surgical resection had a good impact on patients’ functional outcome (86.1% 
either showing an improvement or maintaining a good preoperative status). Uni- 
and multivariate analyses found that both age and preoperative modified 
McCormick independently correlated with relative outcome (coeff = −0.058, p = 
0.0251; coeff = 0.597, p < 0.0001) and with postoperative status (coeff = 0.058, 
p = 0.02507; coeff = 0.402, p = 0.00027), respectively. (4) Conclusions: Age and 
preoperative modified McCormick were found to be independent prognostic factors. 
Nevertheless, advanced age (≥75), per se, did not seem to contraindicate 
surgery, even in those with severe preoperative neurological deficits. The 
functional results sustain the need for surgical resection of SM in the elderly.

The Positive Memory Training (PoMeT) trial demonstrated reduced depression 
symptoms at 3 months for schizophrenia, but its longer-term outcome and cost 
impacts remain unknown. This study is a within-trial cost-utility analysis with 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome based on health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) measurement and secondary outcome analyses of capability 
well-being. The incremental cost-effectiveness of PoMeT was compared to 
Treatment As Usual only (TAU) over 9 months from the 'health and social' care 
and 'societal' perspectives. Uncertainty was explored using bootstrapping and 
sensitivity analyses for cost outliers and outcome methods. HRQoL improvement 
was observed for both PoMeT and TAU at 3 months, but reached statistical 
significance and was sustained only for TAU. There was no change in capability 
well-being and no significant group difference in QALYs gained over 9 months. 
Mean intervention cost was GBP 823. Compared to TAU, PoMeT had significantly 
higher mental health care costs (+GBP 1251, 95% CI GBP 185 to GBP 2316) during 
the trial, but 'health and social care' and 'societal' cost differences were 
non-significant. Compared to the before-trial period, psychiatric medication 
costs increased significantly in both groups. The probability of PoMeT being 
cost-effective in the given format over 9 months was <30% and decreased further 
in sensitivity analyses.. Generalizability remains limited since the 
before-after cost analysis revealed additional treatment effects also in the TAU 
group that likely diminished the incremental impacts and cost-effectiveness of 
PoMeT. It is not clear whether an active post-intervention follow-up could 
result in sustained longer-term effects and improved cost-effectiveness.

The rapidly ageing population, the growing rate of divorce, and the longer life 
expectancy of women compared with men have resulted in a large proportion of 
older Chinese women being alone. The sexual health and intimacy needs of this 
group of women are ignored due to traditional Chinese cultural values that 
undermine older adults' needs for sex and intimacy, and the subordinate position 
of women in society. The present study used a quantitative survey method to 
investigate bio-psycho-social factors associated with divorced and widowed older 
Chinese women's sexual health and intimacy needs in two cities in Shanghai and 
Wuhan. The conceptual framework of this study was guided by cognitive stress 
theory, attachment theory, gender theory, socioemotional selectivity theory, 
objectification theory, and activity theory. We adopted a model involving 
demographic, biological, psychological, and social factors to unearth the 
mechanism influencing divorced and widowed older Chinese women's sexual health 
and intimacy needs. Data were collected between October 2020 and March 2021 via 
face-to-face surveys. A convenience sample of 278 (N = 278) divorced and widowed 
older Chinese women was recruited (166 in Shanghai and 112 in Wuhan). Sexual 
health and intimacy needs were associated with current relationship status, 
financial status, physical health, attachment style, neuroticism, mental health, 
social support, prior marital conflict, and gender norm attitude. Sexual 
behaviour was associated with age, number of children, financial status, 
physical health, attachment style, neuroticism, prior marital conflict, gender 
norm attitude, sexual knowledge, sexual attitude, and intimacy attitude as 
predictors. Most participants in this study seemed to have found new intimate 
partners with whom to continue participating in sexual activities after their 
divorce or widowhood. The present study is one of the first examples of 
empirical research to examine the sexual health and intimacy needs of older 
Chinese women who are divorced or widowed. The findings generated by this study 
will inform the design and implementation of appropriate social programs for 
this demographic, and provide invaluable insight for social workers, educators, 
sex therapists, healthcare professionals, community workers, and policymakers 
working with this population.

Population mortality is an important step in quantifying the risk of longevity. 
China lacks data on population mortality, especially the elderly population. 
Therefore, this paper first uses spline fitting to supplement the missing data 
and then uses dynamic models to predict the species mortality of the Chinese 
population, including age extrapolation and trend extrapolation. Firstly, for 
age extrapolation, kannisto is used to expand the data of the high-age 
population. Secondly, the Lee-Carter single-factor model is used to predict 
gender and age mortality. This paper fills and smoothes the deficiencies of the 
original data to make up for the deficiencies of our population mortality data 
and improve the prediction accuracy of population mortality and life expectancy, 
while analyzing the impact of mortality improvement and providing a theoretical 
basis for policies to deal with the risk of longevity.

In the last two decades, human life expectancy has increased by about 10 years, 
but this has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in healthy 
lifespan. Aging is associated with a wide range of human disorders, including 
cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Delaying 
the aging of organs or tissues and improving the physiological functions of the 
elderly can reduce the risk of aging-related diseases. Autophagy and apoptosis 
are crucial mechanisms for cell survival and tissue homeostasis, and may also be 
primary aging-regulatory pathways. Recent epidemiological studies have shown 
that eating more colorful plant foods could increase life expectancy. Several 
representative phytochemicals in dark-colored plant foods such as quercetin, 
catechin, curcumin, anthocyanins, and lycopene have apparent antiaging 
potential. Nevertheless, the antiaging signaling pathways of the phytochemicals 
from dark-colored plant foods remain elusive. In the present review, we 
summarized autophagy- and apoptosis-associated targeting pathways of those 
phytochemicals and discussed the core targets involved in the antiaging effects. 
Further clinical evaluation and exploitation of phytochemicals as antiaging 
agents are needed to develop novel antiaging therapeutics for preventing 
age-related diseases and improving a healthy lifespan.

The interaction between selective nutrients and linked genes involving a 
specific organ reveals the genetic make-up of an individual in response to a 
particular nutrient. The interaction of genes with food opens opportunities for 
the addition of bioactive compounds for specific populations comprising 
identical genotypes. The slight difference in the genetic blueprints of humans 
is advantageous in determining the effect of nutrients and their metabolism in 
the body. The basic knowledge of emerging nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics can be 
applied to optimize health, prevention, and treatment of diseases. In addition, 
nutrient-mediated pathways detecting the cellular concentration of nutrients 
such as sugars, amino acids, lipids, and metabolites are integrated and 
coordinated at the organismal level via hormone signals. This review deals with 
the interaction of nutrients with various aspects of nutrigenetics and 
nutrigenomics along with pathways involved in nutrient sensing and regulation, 
which can provide a detailed understanding of this new leading edge in nutrition 
research and its potential application to dietetic practice.

Kidneys play an especial role in copper redistribution in the organism. The 
epithelial cells of proximal tubules perform the functions of both copper uptake 
from the primary urine and release to the blood. These cells are equipped on 
their apical and basal membrane with copper transporters CTR1 and ATP7A. Mosaic 
mutant mice displaying a functional dysfunction of ATP7A are an established 
model of Menkes disease. These mice exhibit systemic copper deficiency despite 
renal copper overload, enhanced by copper therapy, which is indispensable for 
their life span extension. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression 
of Slc31a1 and Slc31a2 genes (encoding CTR1/CTR2 proteins) and the cellular 
localization of the CTR1 protein in suckling, young and adult mosaic mutants. 
Our results indicate that in the kidney of both intact and copper-injected 
14-day-old mutants showing high renal copper content, CTR1 mRNA level is not 
up-regulated compared to wild-type mice given a copper injection. The expression 
of the Slc31a1 gene in 45-day-old mice is even reduced compared with intact 
wild-type animals. In suckling and young copper-injected mutants, the CTR1 
protein is relocalized from the apical membrane to the cytoplasm of epithelial 
cells of proximal tubules, the process which prevents copper transport from the 
primary urine and, thus, protects cells against copper toxicity.

Protoplasts are single cells isolated from tissues or organs and are considered 
a suitable system for cell studies in plants. Embryogenic cells are totipotent 
stem cells, but their regeneration ability decreases or becomes lost altogether 
with extension of the culture period. In this study, we isolated and cultured 
EC-derived protoplasts (EC-pts) from carrots and compared them with 
non-EC-derived protoplasts (NEC-pts) with respect to their totipotency. The 
protoplast isolation conditions were optimized, and the EC-pts and NEC-pts were 
characterized by their cell size and types. Both types of protoplasts were then 
embedded using the alginate layer (TAL) method, and the resulting EC-pt-TALs and 
NEC-pt-TALs were cultured for further regeneration. The expression of the 
EC-specific genes SERK1, WUS, BBM, LEC1, and DRN was analyzed to confirm whether 
EC identity was maintained after protoplast isolation. The protoplast isolation 
efficiency for EC-pts was 2.4-fold higher than for NEC-pts (3.5 × 106 
protoplasts·g−1 FW). In the EC-pt group, protoplasts < 20 µm accounted for 58% 
of the total protoplasts, whereas in the NEC-pt group, small protoplasts 
accounted for only 26%. In protoplast culture, the number of protoplasts that 
divided was 2.6-fold higher for EC-pts than for NEC-pts (7.7 × 104 
protoplasts·g−1 FW), with a high number of plants regenerated for EC-pt-TALs, 
whereas no plants were induced by NEC-pt-TAL. Five times more plants were 
regenerated from EC-pts than from ECs. Regarding the expression of EC-specific 
genes, WUS and SERK1 expression increased 12-fold, and LEC1 and BBM expression 
increased 3.6−6.4-fold in isolated protoplasts compared with ECs prior to 
protoplast isolation (control). These results reveal that the protoplast 
isolation process did not affect the embryogenic cell identity; rather, it 
increased the plant regeneration rate, confirming that EC-derived protoplast 
culture may be an efficient system for increasing the regeneration ability of 
old EC cultures through the elimination of old and inactivate cells. EC-derived 
protoplasts may also represent an efficient single-cell system for application 
in new breeding technologies such as genome editing.

Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) is the pathogen of hepatopancreatic 
microsporidiosis (HPM) in shrimp. The diseased shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei 
exhibits a slow growth syndrome, which causes severe economic losses. Herein, 4D 
label-free quantitative proteomics was employed to analyze the hepatopancreas of 
L. vannamei with a light (EHPptp2 < 103 copies/50 ng hpDNA, L group) and heavy 
(EHPptp2 > 104 copies/50 ng hpDNA, H group) load of EHP to better understand the 
pathogenesis of HPM. Exactly 786 (L group) and 1056 (H group) differentially 
expressed proteins (DEPs) versus the EHP-free (C group) control were mainly 
clustered to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy production 
processing. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited down-regulation 
significantly in lipid metabolism, especially in the elongation and degradation 
of fatty acid, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid, metabolism of α-linolenic 
acid, sphingolipid, and glycerolipid, as well as juvenile hormone (JH) 
degradation. Expression pattern analysis showed that the degree of infection was 
positively correlated with metabolic change. About 479 EHP proteins were 
detected in infected shrimps, including 95 predicted transporters. These 
findings suggest that EHP infection induced the consumption of storage lipids 
and the entire down-regulation of lipid metabolism and the coupling energy 
production, in addition to the hormone metabolism disorder. These were 
ultimately responsible for the stunted growth.
