Survival data were obtained from the phase III NETTER-1 trial in patients with 
metastatic midgut NETs. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 4% 
per annum. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, for patients with midgut NETs, 
177Lu-Dotatate treatment improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.21 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to octreotide LAR 60 mg and the 
lifetime treatment costs were EUR 50,784 higher with 177Lu-Dotatate resulting in 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR 42,106 per QALY gained 
versus octreotide LAR 60 mg. When compared with everolimus, 177Lu-Dotatate was 
associated with an ICER of EUR 59,769 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses 
showed that the results were sensitive to methods used to extrapolate survival 
data.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with advanced progressive midgut NETs 177Lu-Dotatate 
is likely to be considered a cost-effective option versus octreotide 60 mg from 
the perspective of the French healthcare payer.

Aging is a complex biological process, a major aspect of which is the 
accumulation of somatic changes throughout life. Cellular senescence is a 
condition in which cells undergo an irreversible cell cycle arrest in response 
to various cellular stresses. Once the cells begin to senesce, they become more 
resistant to any mutagens, including oncogenic factors. Inflammaging 
(inflammatory aging) is an age-related, chronic, and systemic inflammatory 
condition realized by cells with the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype 
(SASP). These recently recognized senescent phenotypes associated with aging 
have been reported to promote better wound healing, embryonic development, as 
well as stimulation and extension of the tumor process. It is assumed that 
cellular senescence contributes to the age-related decline of reproductive 
function due to the association of senescent cells with aging and age-related 
diseases. Thus, SASPs have both positive and negative effects, depending on the 
biological context. SASP cell accumulation in tissues contributes to an 
age-related functional decline of the tissue and organ state. In this review, 
the term "cellular senescence" is used to refer to the processes of cells 
irreversible growth inhibition during their viable state, while the term "aging" 
is used to indicate the deterioration of tissues due to loss of function. Late 
reproductive age is associated with infertility and possible complications of 
the onset and maintenance of pregnancy. Senescent cells express pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases and some other 
molecules collectively called the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype 
(SASP).

BACKGROUND: The ultimate goal of mitral valve surgery in young women is to 
extend life expectancy and improve quality of life. Mitral valve replacement 
(MVR) prosthesis in middle-aged women is a difficult choice between the lifelong 
anticoagulation by mechanical prosthesis versus the limited long-term durability 
of bioprosthesis. The current trend towards reducing women's age for selecting 
bioprosthesis over mechanical prosthesis leads to a dilemma for younger women 
decision making. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and freedom 
from complications in pregnancy and survival rate after mitral valve 
bioprosthesis versus mechanical prosthesis in young women for whom mitral valve 
repair is not feasible, or unsuitable.
METHODS: This single-center non randomized prospective study included all female 
patients undergoing MVR at our center from January 2010 to February 2020.
RESULTS: In total, 355 young women patients underwent MVR at our center, of whom 
174 received a bioprosthesis and 181 received a mechanical prosthesis. The use 
of anticoagulation among young women with mechanical prosthesis was associated 
with a remarkable risk of postoperative bleeding, abortion, and increased 
frequency of pregnancy-related complications (P < .0001). In contrast, there was 
a considerable survival benefit for those who received bioprosthesis (P = 
.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our data confirm that the use of mitral bioprosthesis in young women 
who desire to become pregnant is safe, reduces complications, and increases 
survival.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) has an important role in the multiple trajectories of 
cognitive aging. However, environmental variables and other genes mediate the 
impact of APOE on cognition. Our main objective was to analyze the effect of 
APOE genotype on cognition and its interactions and relationships with sex, age, 
lipid profile, C-reactive protein, and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
genotype in a sample of 648 healthy participants over 50 years of age with a 
comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Our results showed that APOE ε2 
carriers performed better in the Verbal Memory (p = .002) and Fluency Domains (p 
= .001). When we studied the effect of sex, we observed that the beneficial 
effect of APOE ε2 on the normalized values of these cognitive domains occurred 
only in females (β = 0.735; 95% confidence interval, 0.396-1.074; p = 3.167·10-5 
and β = 0.568; 95% confidence interval, 0.276-0.861; p = 1.853·10-4, 
respectively). Similarly, the sex-specific effects of APOE ε2 were further 
observed on lipidic and inflammation biomarkers. In the whole sample, APOE ε2 
carriers showed significantly lower levels of total cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein. These differences were found 
only among females. Furthermore, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol mediated the protective effect of APOE ε2 on cognition in the whole 
sample and total cholesterol in females, providing candidate physiological 
mechanisms for the observed genetic effects. Our results show that the 
neuroprotective role of APOE ε2 in cognition varies with sex and that the 
lipidic profile partially mediates this protection. Age-related cognitive and 
functional decline is a continuous biological process with different cognitive 
trajectories (1). Complex interactions between heritability, environmental 
influence, and cognitive functions in aging have been highlighted (2). In 
particular, genetic differences explain around 15%-25% of the variance in life 
expectancy (3). Therefore, the identification of susceptibility genes and their 
biological effects on cognitive aging is required to establish interindividual 
differences in this process and promote early personalized interventions to 
delay cognitive decline and minimize the financial burden of aging in the health 
care system.

Guava is an important climacteric fruits in terms of taste and aroma, which 
contains various vital nutrients such as minerals, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, 
and polyphenols. At ambient conditions, it exhibits a short shelf life, which 
makes it difficult for marketing and subsequent storage. Therefore, it is 
necessary to develop procedures to extend its shelf life and conserve quality. 
For this purpose, an aloe vera (AV) gel coating was assessed for its potential 
to enhance the shelf life of guava fruits. Guava fruits coated with AV gels (0, 
20, 40, 60 and 80%, v/v) were evaluated for postharvest shelf life extension, 
changes in quality attributes, anti-oxidative activities, and flavonoid content 
when stored at ambient conditions (23 ± 2 °C and 70-75% relative humidity) for 
12 days. The AV gel-treated fruits showed reduced increments in total sugar, 
malondialdehyde, and total carotene contents compared to untreated controls. AV 
gel-treated fruits exhibited higher contents of ascorbic acid, flavonoids 
(quercetin and rutin), and total phenolics in comparison to control fruits. 
Moreover, AV gel-treated fruits displayed greater activities of superoxide 
dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, along with higher antioxidant 
capacity and higher levels of total soluble solids, than untreated fruits. These 
results demonstrate that AV gel coating, especially at high concentrations, can 
be considered an eco-friendly and non-chemical substitute treatment for 
maintaining the postharvest quality of guava fruit.

The peachtree borer, Synanthedon exitiosa, and lesser peachtree borer, S. 
pictipes, are economically important indirect pests of peach in West Virginia. 
The purpose of this 3-year study was to compare the efficacy of mating 
disruption and post-harvest trunk sprays of chlorpyrifos insecticide for control 
of this pest complex in a commercial peach orchard. Overall, Isomate PTB-Dual 
disruption dispensers applied at a rate of 371/ha significantly disrupted the 
male mate-finding behavior of S. exitiosa and S. pictipes. In addition, the 
infestation of peach trees by S. exitiosa larvae did not vary significantly 
between mating disruption and insecticide treated plots. Hot-spot maps of S. 
exitiosa infestation showed significant spatial clusters of infestation 
predominately near the perimeter of all orchard plots, or where trees were 
missing within and/or between rows. The generation of standard deviational 
ellipses revelated that the location of S. exitiosa infestations in orchard 
plots remained relatively constant between years, and were generally oriented in 
a north and easterly direction, which coincided with the prevailing wind 
direction. Although our data indicated that mating disruption can provide 
growers with an effective non-chemical alternative to chlorpyrifos trunk sprays, 
several variables may affect its long-term success in West Virginia peach 
orchards; most notably the presence of high population densities, problems with 
maintaining adequate pheromone coverage, and the need for area-wide 
implementation.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable systemic connective tissue disease with 
important cardiovascular involvement, including aortic root dilatation and 
mitral valve prolapse. Life expectancy in patients with MFS is mainly determined 
by cardiovascular complications, among which aortic dissection or rupture are 
most dreaded. In recent years, heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia have 
drawn attention as extra-aortic cardiovascular manifestations and as additional 
reported causes of death. Imaging studies have provided data supporting a 
primary myocardial impairment in the absence of valvular disease or 
cardiovascular surgery, while studies using ambulatory ECG have demonstrated an 
increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia. In this paper, current 
literature was reviewed in order to provide insights in characteristics, 
pathophysiology and evolution of myocardial function, heart failure and 
ventricular arrhythmia in MFS.

Micro and nanoscale changes allow the optimization of physico-chemical 
properties of titanium implant surfaces. Recently UV and plasma treatments have 
allowed surface hydrophilicity to take increased prominence; however, this 
beneficial effect is short-lived. The aim of this study is to investigate 
methodologies post-anodizing treatment to generate and maintain high surface 
hydrophilicity along with high biocompatibility. Anodized surfaces were 
characterized regarding physical-chemical properties. Then, surface wettability 
with nanomorphology was evaluated at different times and with distinct 
post-treatments: as deposited, with a reactive plasma and UV-light 
post-treatment, stored in air or deionized (DI) water. Adhesion, alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) activity and bone cell viability tests were executed after the 
incremental treatments. The anodizing process generated a surface with TiO2 
nanotubes morphology and micro-roughness. Plasma-treated surfaces resulted in 
the most hydrophilic samples and this property was maintained for a longer 
period when those were stored in DI water (angle variation of 7° to 12° in 21 
days). Furthermore, plasma post-treatment changed the titanium surface 
crystalline phase from amorphous to anatase. Anodized surfaces modified by 
reactive plasma and stored in DI water suggest better hydrophilicity stability, 
biocompatibility, ALP activity and achievement of crystalline phase alteration, 
indicating future potential use on biomedical implants.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to quantify the burden caused by viral 
hepatitis in China from 1990 to 2016.
METHODS: Data from the GBD 2016 study were extracted to calculate incidence, 
prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Trends in DALYs were 
assessed in 33 provinces/regions.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2016, the total incidence of hepatitis decreased by 88.5%. 
However, the prevalence of hepatitis (counts in thousands), increased by 37.6% 
from 153,856 (95% UI: 136,047-172,319) in 1990 to 211,721 (95% UI: 
179,776-240,981) in 2016, with age-standardized prevalence rates changing 
slightly. The number and age-standardized rates of prevalence increased by 35.9 
and 1.6% for hepatitis B, respectively, and by 81.8 and 30.4% for hepatitis C. 
Guangxi, Guangdong and Hainan had the highest age-standardized prevalence rates 
(≥16,500 per 100,000). Tibet, Qinghai and Gansu had the highest age-standardized 
DALYs rates (≥40 per 100,000). The largest absolute number of DALYs was observed 
in the 15-49 year age group in 2016. The highest rate of DALYs occurred in males 
aged 50-69 years and in females aged ≧70 years.
CONCLUSION: The incidence and DALYs of viral hepatitis decreased dramatically 
from 1990 to 2016. However, the prevalence still remains at a high level, which 
may result in heavy burdens in the future.

Gains in life expectancy in the Australian population due to reductions in 
smoking: comparisons between interventions targeting the population versus 
interventions in a specific high risk group.

BACKGROUND: Four decades of population-based tobacco control strategies have 
contributed to substantial reduction in smoking prevalence in Australia. 
However, smoking prevalence is still double in socially disadvantaged groups 
compared to those that are not. But not all tobacco control strategies 
successfully used in the general population is effective in specific high-risk 
population groups. Hence, an effective way to reduce smoking in high risk 
population groups may include targeting them specifically to identify and 
support smokers to quit. In this backdrop, we examined whether tobacco control 
interventions at the population-level are more effective in increasing life 
expectancy among Australians compared to interventions targeting a high risk 
group or a combination of the two when smoking prevalence is reduced to 10 and 
0% respectively.
METHODS: Using the risk percentiles approach, analyses were performed separately 
for men and women using data from various sources such as the 2014-15 National 
Health Survey linked to death registry, simulated data for high risk groups, and 
the Australian population and deaths data from the census. Indigenous status was 
simulated by preferentially assigning those who are indigenous to lower SES 
quintiles. The age-sex distribution of mental disorder status was simulated 
using its distribution from 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey with 
25.9% of mentally ill being assigned to current smoking category and the rest to 
non-smoking category. The age-sex distribution of prisoners was simulated based 
on 2014 ABS Prisoners Australia survey with 74% of prisoners being assigned to 
current smoker category and the rest to non-smoker category. Homelessness status 
was simulated according to age, sex and indigenous status for 2011 census with 
all homeless being allocated to the lowest SES category. The age-sex 
distribution of total cholesterol level was simulated based on 2011-13 
Australian Health Survey.
RESULTS: The results showed that the combined approach for reducing smoking is 
most effective for improving life expectancy of Australians particularly for the 
socially disadvantaged and mentally ill groups both of which have high fraction 
of smokers in the population. For those who were mentally ill the gain in ALE 
due to reduction of smoking to 10% was 0.53 years for males and 0.36 years for 
females which were around 51 and 42% respectively of the maximal gains in ALE 
that could be achieved through complete cessation.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting high-risk population groups having substantial fraction 
of smokers in the population can strongly complement the existing 
population-based smoking reduction strategies. As population and high risk 
approaches are both important, the national prevention policies should make 
judicious use of both to maximize health gain.

BACKGROUND: In Japan, a high-sodium diet is the most important dietary risk 
factor and is known to cause a range of health problems. This study aimed to 
forecast Japan's disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) for chronic diseases that 
would be associated with high-sodium diet in different future scenarios of salt 
intake. We modelled DALY forecast and alternative future scenarios of salt 
intake for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), and 
stomach cancer (SC) from 2017 to 2040.
METHODS: We developed a three-component model of disease-specific DALYs: a 
component on the changes in major behavioural and metabolic risk predictors 
including salt intake; a component on the income per person, educational 
attainment, and total fertility rate under 25 years; and an autoregressive 
integrated moving average model to capture the unexplained component correlated 
over time. Data on risk predictors were obtained from Japan's National Health 
and Nutrition Surveys and from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. To 
generate a reference forecast of disease-specific DALY rates for 2017-2040, we 
modelled the three diseases using the data for 1990-2016. Additionally, we 
generated better, moderate, and worse scenarios to evaluate the impact of change 
in salt intake on the DALY rate for the diseases.
RESULTS: In our reference forecast, the DALY rates across all ages were 
predicted to be stable for CVDs, continuously increasing for CKDs, and 
continuously decreasing for SC. Meanwhile, the age group-specific DALY rates for 
these three diseases were forecasted to decrease, with some exceptions. Except 
for the ≥70 age group, there were remarkable differences in DALY rates between 
scenarios, with the best scenario having the lowest DALY rates in 2040 for SC. 
This represents a wide scope of future trajectories by 2040 with a potential for 
tremendous decrease in SC burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The gap between scenarios provides some quantification of the range 
of policy impacts on future trajectories of salt intake. Even though we do not 
yet know the policy mix used to achieve these scenarios, the result that there 
can be differences between scenarios means that policies today can have a 
significant impact on the future DALYs.

BACKGROUND: Traditionally, menstrual education has consisted of lectures 
directed toward women. The objective of this study was to design an innovative 
menstrual education (ME) program that reflects the needs of both young women and 
men, and verify its effectiveness.
METHODS: A mixed-method design was used to determine the program needs and 
assess young adults' knowledge and perceptions of menstruation and menstrual 
products. Focus group interviews were conducted with 14 young adults, and 150 
young adults participated in an online survey. After developing the ME program, 
10 young adults participated in a study to verify its effectiveness.
RESULTS: Interview results showed young adults wanted more information about 
menstrual products. The online survey revealed significant differences in 
knowledge based on participants' general characteristics and experience; 
exposure to menstruation and menstrual products positively impacted knowledge 
and perception. In addition, the results indicated young adults wanted ME 
content access via mobile and in-person modalities, designed for both genders, 
drawing on menstrual experts' knowledge. Based on these results, a 
multi-experimental menstrual education (MEME) program was designed and included: 
hands-on exposure to 60 menstrual products, product demonstrations with a female 
perineal model, a YouTube video created by the researchers, a true-or-false 
quiz, and question-and-answer sessions with menstrual experts.
CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the requirements of an innovative menstrual 
education program. It led to high satisfaction among participants, and improved 
knowledge and perceptions of menstruation and menstrual products. The online 
survey showed a correlation between the extent of received ME, and respondents' 
perception of menstrual products. This implied that a MEME program could change 
perceptions when conducted systematically; by extension it could ameliorate 
menstruation challenges attributed to poverty. Future research could further 
verify the effectiveness of the MEME program, using a larger sample, and examine 
its suitability for incorporation into official ME curricula at universities and 
companies.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the mortality from all causes 
as a result of physical inactivity in Brazil and in Brazilian states over 
28 years (1990-2017).
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for Brazil and 
states were used. The metrics used were the summary exposure value (SEV), the 
number of deaths, age-standardized mortality rates, and the fraction of 
population risk attributable to physical inactivity.
RESULTS: The Brazilian population presented risk of exposure to physical 
inactivity of (age-standardized SEV) of 59% (95% U.I. 22-97) in 1990 and 59% in 
2017 (95% U.I. 25-99). Physical inactivity contributed a significant number of 
deaths (1990, 22,537, 95% U.I. 12,157-34,745; 2017, 32,410, 95% U.I. 
17,976-49,657) in the analyzed period. These values represented mortality rates 
standardized by age (per 100,000 inhabitants) of 31 (95% U.I. 17-48) in 1990 and 
15 (95% U.I. 8-23) in 2017. From 1990 to 2017, a decrease in standardized death 
rate from all causes attributable to physical inactivity was observed in Brazil 
(- 52%, 95% U.I. - 54 to - 49). The Brazilian states with better socioeconomic 
conditions presented greater reductions in age-standardized mortality (male: rho 
= 0.80; female: rho 0.84) over the period of 28 years.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the promotion of physical activity in the 
Brazilian population for the prevention of early mortality.

BACKGROUND: The present study sought to analyze smoking prevalence and 
smoking-attributable mortality estimates produced by the 2017 Global Burden of 
Disease Study for Brazil, 26 states, and the Federal District.
METHODS: Prevalence of current smokers from 1990 to 2017 by sex and age was 
estimated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression. 
Population-attributable fractions were calculated for different risk-outcome 
pairs to generate estimates of smoking-attributable mortality. A cohort analysis 
of smoking prevalence by birth-year cohort was performed to better understand 
temporal age patterns in smoking. Smoking-attributable mortality rates were 
described and analyzed by development at state levels, using the 
Socio-Demographic Index (SDI). Finally, a decomposition analysis was conducted 
to evaluate the contribution of different factors to the changes in the number 
of deaths attributable to smoking between 1990 and 2017.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2017, prevalence of smoking in the population (≥ 
20 years old) decreased from 35.3 to 11.3% in Brazil. This downward trend was 
seen for both sexes and in all states, with a marked reduction in exposure to 
this risk factor in younger cohorts. Smoking-attributable mortality rates 
decreased by 57.8% (95% UI - 61.2, - 54.1) between 1990 and 2017. Overall, 
larger reductions were observed in states with higher SDI (Pearson correlation 
0.637; p < 0.01). In Brazil, smoking remains responsible for a considerable 
amount of deaths, especially due to cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms.
CONCLUSIONS: Brazil has adopted a set of regulatory measures and implemented 
anti-tobacco policies that, along with improvements in socioeconomic conditions, 
have contributed to the results presented in the present study. Other regulatory 
measures need to be implemented to boost a reduction in smoking in order to 
reach the goals established in the scope of the 2030 United Nations Agenda for 
Sustainable Development.

BACKGROUND: Brazil is the world's fifth most populous nation, and is currently 
experimenting a fast demographic aging process in a context of scarce resources 
and social inequalities. To understand the health profile of older adults in 
Brazil is fundamental for planning public policies.
METHODS: The estimates were derived from data obtained through the collaboration 
between the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Metrics and 
Evaluation of the University of Washington. The Brazilian Institute of Geography 
and Statistics provided the population estimates. Data on causes of death came 
from the Mortality Information System. To calculate morbidity, population-based 
studies on the prevalence of diseases in Brazil were comprehensively searched, 
in addition to information obtained from national databases such as the Hospital 
Information System, the Outpatient Information System, and the Injury 
Information System. We presented the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 
estimates among Brazilian older adults (60+ years old) for life expectancy at 
birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, years of 
life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), from 2000 to 2017.
RESULTS: LE at birth significantly increased from 71.3 years (95% UI to 
70.9-71.8) to 75.2 years (95% UI 74.7-75.7). There was a trend of increasing 
HALE, from 62.2 years (95% UI 59.54-64.5) to 65.5 years (95% UI 62.6-68.0). The 
proportion of DALYs among older adults increased from 7.3 to 10.3%. Chronic 
noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death among middle aged and 
older adults, while Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause only among older 
adults. Mood disorders, musculoskeletal pain, and hearing or vision losses are 
among the leading causes of disability.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in LE and the decrease of the DALYs rates are probably 
results of the improvement of social conditions and health policies. However, 
the smaller increase of HALE than LE means that despite living more, people 
spend a substantial time of their old age with disability and illness. 
Preventable or potentially controllable diseases are responsible for most of the 
burden of disease among Brazilian older adults. Health investments are necessary 
to obtain longevity with quality of life in Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the major causes of disability worldwide. The 
objective of this study was to analyze the results of the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2017 (GBD-2017) for depressive disorders in Brazil and its 
Federated Units (FUs) in 1990 and 2017.
METHODS: We used GBD-2017 study methodology to evaluate the prevalence 
estimates, the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), and the years lived with 
disability (YLDs) for depressive disorders, which include major depressive 
disorder and dysthymia. The YLD estimates and the position of these disorders in 
the DALY and YLD rankings were compared to those of seven other countries. The 
observed versus expected YLD, based on the sociodemographic index (SDI), were 
compared.
RESULTS: In GBD-2017, the prevalence of depressive disorders in Brazil was 3.30% 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 3.08 to 3.57), ranging from 3.79% (3.53 to 4.09) 
in Santa Catarina to 2.78% in Pará (2.56 to 3.03), with significant differences 
between the Federated Units. From 1990 to 2017, there was an increase in number 
of YLD (55.19%, 49.57 to 60.73), but a decrease in the age-standardized rates 
(- 9.01%, - 11.66 to - 6.31). The highest proportion of YLD was observed in the 
age range of 15-64 years and among females. These disorders rank 4th and 13th as 
leading causes of YLD and DALY, respectively, in Brazil. In the other countries 
evaluated, the ranking of these disorders in the YLD classification was close to 
Brazil's, while in the DALY classification, there was higher variability. All 
countries had YLD rates similar to the overall rate. The observed/expected YLD 
ratio ranged from 0.81 in Pará to 1.16 in Santa Catarina. Morbidity of 
depressive disorders was not associated with SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorders have been responsible for a high disability 
burden since 1990, especially in adult women living in the Southern region of 
the country. The number of people affected by these disorders in the country 
tends to increase, requiring more investment in mental health aimed at 
advancements and quality of services. The epidemiological studies of these 
disorders throughout the national territory can contribute to this planning and 
to making the Brazilian health system more equitable.

BACKGROUND: This study presents the malaria burden in Brazil from 1990 to 2017 
using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2017 (GBD 2017), by analyzing disease burden indicators in federated units of 
the Legal Amazon and Extra-Amazon regions, as well as describing malaria cases 
according to Plasmodium species occurring in the country.
METHODS: We used estimates from the GBD 2017 to report years of life lost due to 
premature death (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for malaria in Brazil, grouped by gender, 
age group, and Brazilian federated unit, from 1990 to 2017. Results are 
presented as absolute numbers and age-standardized rates (per 100,000 
inhabitants) with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).
RESULTS: At the national level, the age-standardized DALYs rate due to malaria 
decreased by 92.0%, from 42.5 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants (95% UI 16.6-56.9) 
in 1990 to 3.4 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants (95% UI 2.7-4.7) in 2017. The YLLs 
were the main component of the total DALYs rate for malaria in 1990 (67.3%), and 
the YLDs were the main component of the metric in 2017 (61.8%). In 2017, the 
highest sex-age DALYs rate was found among females in the "< 1-year-old" age 
group, with a 6.4 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants (95% UI 1.8-14.7) and among 
males in the age group of "20 to 24 years old", with a 4.7 DALYs per 100,000 
inhabitants (95% UI 3.3-9.9). Within the Brazilian Amazon region, the three 
federated units with the highest age-standardized DALYs rates in 2017 were Acre 
[28.4 (95% UI 14.2-39.1)], Roraima [28.3 (95% UI 13.5-40.2)], and Rondônia [24.7 
(95% UI 11.4-34.8)]. Concerning the parasite species that caused malaria, 73.5% 
of the total of cases registered in the period had Plasmodium vivax as the 
etiological agent.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the GBD 2017 show that despite the considerable 
reduction in the DALYs rates between 1990 and 2017, malaria remains a relevant 
and preventable disease, which in recent years has generated more years of life 
lost due to disability than deaths. The states endemic for malaria in the Amazon 
region require constant evaluation of preventive and control measures. The 
present study will contribute to the direction of current health policies aimed 
at reducing the burden of malaria in Brazil, as knowing the geographical and 
temporal distribution of the risk of death and disability of this disease can 
facilitate the planning, implementation, and improvement of control strategies 
aimed at eliminating the disease.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence and burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions are 
growing around the world, and low back pain (LBP) is the most significant of the 
five defined MSK disorders in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. LBP has 
been the leading cause of non-fatal health loss for the last three decades. The 
objective of this study is to describe the current status and trends of the 
burden due to LBP in Brazil based on information drawn from the GBD 2017 study.
METHODS: We estimated prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) for LBP 
by Brazilian federative units, sex, age group, and age-standardized between 1990 
and 2017 and conducted a decomposition analysis of changes in age- and 
sex-specific YLD rates attributable to total population growth and population 
ageing for the purpose of understanding the drivers of changes in LBP YLDs rates 
in Brazil. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) rankings for this disease over the period.
RESULTS: The results show high prevalence and burden of LBP in Brazil. LBP 
prevalence increased 26.83% (95% UI 23.08 to 30.41) from 1990 to 2017. This MSK 
condition represents the most important cause of YLDs in Brazil, where the 
increase in burden is mainly related to increase in population size and ageing. 
The LBP age-standardized YLDs rate are similar among Brazilian federative units. 
LBP ranks in the top three causes of DALYs in Brazil, even though it does not 
contribute to mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study show LBP to be the most important cause of 
YLDs and the 3rd leading cause of DALYs in Brazil. The Brazilian population is 
ageing, and the country has been experiencing a rapid epidemiological 
transition, which generates an increasing number of people who need chronic 
care. In this scenario, more attention should be paid to the burden of non-fatal 
health conditions.
