Green care is an innovative approach that combines simultaneously caring for 
people and caring for land through three elements that have not been previously 
connected: (1) multifunctional agriculture and recognition of the plurality of 
agricultural system values; (2) social services and health care; and (3) the 
possibility of strengthening the farming sector and local communities. The 
current research provides a comprehensive overview of green care in Europe as a 
scientific discipline through a literature review (n = 98 studies). According to 
our results, the Netherlands, the UK, Norway and Sweden followed by Italy have 
led the scientific studies published in English. Green care research comprises a 
wide range of perspectives and frameworks (social farming, care farming, 
nature-based solutions, etc.) with differences in their specificities. Green 
care studies have mainly focused on measuring the effectiveness of therapeutic 
interventions. Studies that evaluate its relevance in socio-economic and 
environmental terms are still limited. According to our results, the most common 
users studied were people suffering from psychological and mental ill health, 
while the most common activities were horticulture, animal husbandry and 
gardening. Finally, we discuss the potential of green care to reconnect people 
with nature and to diversify the farming sector providing new public services 
associated with the relational values society obtains from the contact with 
agricultural systems.

BACKGROUND: A novel framework is proposed to analyse metabolic fluxes in 
non-steady state conditions, based on the new concept of dynamic elementary mode 
(dynEM): an elementary mode activated partially depending on the time point of 
the experiment.
RESULTS: Two methods are introduced here: dynamic elementary mode analysis 
(dynEMA) and dynamic elementary mode regression discriminant analysis 
(dynEMR-DA). The former is an extension of the recently proposed principal 
elementary mode analysis (PEMA) method from steady state to non-steady state 
scenarios. The latter is a discriminant model that permits to identify which 
dynEMs behave strongly different depending on the experimental conditions. Two 
case studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with fluxes derived from simulated and 
real concentration data sets, are presented to highlight the benefits of this 
dynamic modelling.
CONCLUSIONS: This methodology permits to analyse metabolic fluxes at early 
stages with the aim of i) creating reduced dynamic models of flux data, ii) 
combining many experiments in a single biologically meaningful model, and iii) 
identifying the metabolic pathways that drive the organism from one state to 
another when changing the environmental conditions.

BACKGROUND: Longevity is an important trait for increasing the profitability of 
dairy production. Long cow longevity is also essential to reduce the 
environmental impact of milk production, and to maintain positive consumer 
attitude. Genetic selection for increased longevity has been effective, but the 
phenotypic trend of longevity in Swedish dairy cows has not been improved. The 
objective of this study was to identify herd characteristics and management 
routines that are associated with the average cow longevity in a herd. To obtain 
this information, a questionnaire was developed and sent out to 661 Swedish 
dairy farmers.
RESULTS: The response rate was 35%. Seventeen of the 62 characteristics 
investigated had either a univariable association with the outcome (days from 
birth to culling) at P < 0.15, or were identified as confounders in the causal 
diagram and were therefore considered as candidates for the multivariable 
analysis. Multiple imputation was used to fill in the missing data from the 
questionnaires, and this increased the number of usable observations in the 
multivariable modeling from 156 to 228. Only a few of the investigated herd 
characteristics and management routines were associated with average cow 
longevity. The results demonstrated that using herd health advisory services 
shortened the average longevity, while using breeding advisory services 
prolonged the average longevity in the herd. Furthermore, having a greater 
interest in animal breeding (i.e. genetic selection) decreased the longevity, 
and calling the veterinarian when discovering an unhealthy cow increased the 
average longevity. Higher age of the farmer was also associated with longer 
average herd longevity.
CONCLUSIONS: The herd average cow longevity was only associated with some of the 
farm characteristics and management routines studied. The results demonstrate 
that the use of advisory services and farmers' attitudes could be targeted for 
increasing the herd longevity. Further, the results indicate that other e.g. 
qualitative factors influencing farmers' decisions play an important role.

BACKGROUND: Chagas disease control programmes have decreased the prevalence of 
Chagas disease in Latin America. Together with migration to urban areas and 
increase in life expectancy, a new scenario for Chagas disease has emerged in 
Brazil with most patients currently elderly individuals living in urban areas. 
However, acute Chagas disease cases still occur due to vector transmission by 
sylvatic vectors and oral transmission by contaminated food. Therefore, we 
characterized the clinical and epidemiological profile of the patients followed 
at Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil. We aimed to identify the clinical forms, associated co-morbidities, and 
geographical areas where younger patients originate from. This will aid in the 
identification of potential challenges to be currently faced.
RESULTS: This is a cross-sectional study. Adult patients with chronic Chagas 
disease were recruited between March 2013 and April 2016. Clinical and 
epidemiological data were obtained from electronic medical records and 
interviews. The clinical form of the Chagas disease presented by the patients 
was determined following the Brazilian Consensus on Chagas disease. Six hundred 
and nineteen patients (mean age 60 ± 12 years; 56.9% women) were included in 
this study. Patients' clinical forms were classified as follows: indeterminate 
29.1%; cardiac 55.4%; digestive 5.5%; and mixed 10.0%. Patients aged over 65 
years comprised 38% of the population. Hypertension was present in 347 (56%) 
patients, dyslipidemia in 261 patients (42%) and diabetes mellitus in 185 
patients (30%). There were no differences regarding gender, race, comorbidities 
frequency or place of origin across Chagas disease clinical forms. Most of the 
elderly population originated from Bahia, Minas Gerais and Pernambuco states, 
while most of the younger patients were born in Ceará, Paraíba and Rio de 
Janeiro states.
CONCLUSIONS: We described a great proportion of elderly patients in the 
composition of an urban Brazilian Chagas disease patient cohort with a high 
prevalence of comorbidities. We also identified a change in the pattern of the 
place of origin among younger patients.

The Effects of Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty on Medicare Spending and 
Beneficiary Outcomes: Implications for the Comprehensive Care for Joint 
Replacement Model.

Koenig L(1), Feng C(1), He F(1), Nguyen JT(1).

Author information:
(1)KNG Health Consulting, LLC, Rockville, Maryland.

BACKGROUND: After the first year in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement 
(CJR) model, hospitals must repay Medicare for spending above a target price. 
Hospitals are incentivized to reduce spending in a 90-day episode and generate 
internal cost savings through, for example, the use of lower-cost implants.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to compare quality-adjusted life-years and 
lifetime costs of total hip arthroplasty, under Medicare fee-for-service 
(baseline) and under alternative revision rate assumptions (prospective CJR 
scenarios). Results were generated for 65-year-old and 75-year-old male and 
female Medicare beneficiaries using baseline spending and revision rates from 
Medicare claims. We estimated the impact of CJR on 90-day spending. We ran 
sensitivity analyses for revision rates.
RESULTS: Under willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000, 
the baseline scenario was more cost-effective than the CJR scenario for a 
65-year-old male patient if the revision risk increases by at least 7% (95% 
confidence interval for CJR savings: 4%-22%), 5% (range, 3%-7%), or 3% (range, 
1%-5%), respectively. For males aged 75 years and females, revision risk needs 
to increase by a greater percentage under CJR relative to baseline for Medicare 
fee-for-service to be more cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: The CJR model holds great promise. However, it incentivizes 
hospitals to choose lower-cost implants and adopt newer technology more slowly, 
which could potentially increase revision rates and offset benefits of the 
program. Policy makers should monitor revision rates and consider changes to the 
CJR model to ensure beneficiary access to valuable technology.

BACKGROUND Induction immunosuppression is used in transplantation to prevent 
early acute rejection. The survival benefit of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin 
(rATG) induction has not been established yet. We sought to determine the role 
of rATG in preventing rejection and improving overall survival. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2005 to 2009 and data of 
consecutive 268 heart transplant recipients were reviewed. RESULTS The data of 
144 patients who received induction with rATG were compared to 124 patients who 
did not. Although overall survival was not different between the 2 groups 
(P=0.12), there was a significant difference in restricted mean survival time 
(RMST) at 5 years (RMST=4.8 months; 95% CI: 1.0-8.6, P=0.01) and 10 years 
(RMST=10.4 months; 95% CI: 1.6-19.3, P=0.02) in favor of the non-induced 
patients. No difference was observed between induced and non-induced patients 
who developed de novo donor specific antibodies. There was a significant 
difference in median days to first rejection in favor of the induced group 
(P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Induction with rATG adds no survival benefit in heart 
transplant recipients. Patients who did not receive induction therapy had higher 
life expectancy at 5 years and 10 years. Although there was significant delay in 
the first rejection episode in favor of the rATG induced group, no difference 
was observed in donor specific antibodies. This study indicates a need for 
separate analysis of peri-transplantation co-morbidities and mainly the 
incidence of acute kidney injury, which could affect long-term survival.

Public Health, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea.

BACKGROUND: As job stress is associated with various diseases and psychiatric 
conditions, we aimed to estimate the job stress-attributable burden of disease 
in Korea based on the concept of disability-adjusted life years (DALY).
METHODS: We selected ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, major depressive 
disorder (MDD), and suicide as health outcomes from job stress, because of the 
ease of access to data estimating burdens and of important meaning of them in 
Korean occupational background.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that approximately 21% of Korean workers were 
exposed to high job strain, which was attributable for approximately 6.7% of 
IHDs, 6.9% of strokes, 13.6% of MDDs, and 4% of suicides. In terms of job 
stress-attributable DALY, the burdens of disease per 100,000 people were 38 for 
IHD, 72 for stroke, 168 for MDDs, and 44 for suicides.
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggested that one-fifth of Korean workers were 
suffering from high job strain. Although the figures may not be accurate due to 
several assumptions, job stress is an important risk factor for health in 
working environment in Korea.

Diabetes Mellitus Secondary to Cushing's Disease.

(1)Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, 
Italy.

Associated with important comorbidities that significantly reduce patients' 
overall wellbeing and life expectancy, Cushing's disease (CD) is the most common 
cause of endogenous hypercortisolism. Glucocorticoid excess can lead to 
diabetes, and although its prevalence is probably underestimated, up to 50% of 
patients with CD have varying degrees of altered glucose metabolism. Fasting 
glycemia may nevertheless be normal in some patients in whom glucocorticoid 
excess leads primarily to higher postprandial glucose levels. An oral glucose 
tolerance test should thus be performed in all CD patients to identify glucose 
metabolism abnormalities. Since diabetes mellitus (DM) is a consequence of 
cortisol excess, treating CD also serves to alleviate impaired glucose 
metabolism. Although transsphenoidal pituitary surgery remains the first-line 
treatment for CD, it is not always effective and other treatment strategies may 
be necessary. This work examines the main features of DM secondary to CD and 
focuses on antidiabetic drugs and how cortisol-lowering medication affects 
glucose metabolism.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic immunodeficiency, which is 
characterized by recurrent severe bacterial and fungal infections caused by a 
defect in phagocytic cells due to loss of superoxide production. The disease 
usually manifests within the first years of life. Early diagnosis allows 
therapeutic intervention to improve the limited life expectancy. Nevertheless, 
only half of the patients exceed the age of 25. Here, we present the case of a 
41-year old female patient who presented with an extensive spinal cord infection 
and atypical pneumonia mimicking tuberculosis. The medical history with 
recurrent granulomatous infections and microbiological findings with multiple 
unusual opportunistic pathogens was the key to the diagnosis of CGD, which is 
exceptionally rare first diagnosed in patients in the fifth decade of life. The 
late diagnosis in this case was likely due to the lack of knowledge of the 
disease by the treating teams before but not because the patient did not have 
typical CGD infections along her life. The extensive progressive developing 
granulomas in our patient with fatal outcome raise the question of early 
immunosuppressive therapy in addition to anti-infectious treatment. We recommend 
appropriate CGD diagnostics in adult patients with unclear granulomatous 
diseases of the nervous system.

Cost Effectiveness of Long-Term Incobotulinumtoxin-A Treatment in the Management 
of Post-stroke Spasticity of the Upper Limb from the Australian Payer 
Perspective.

BACKGROUND: In Australia, the reimbursement of botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A) 
on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the treatment of moderate to severe 
spasticity of the upper limb following a stroke (PSS-UL) is restricted to four 
treatment cycles per upper limb per lifetime. This analysis examined the cost 
effectiveness of extending the treatment beyond four treatments among patients 
with an adequate response to previous treatment cycles.
METHODS: A Markov state transition model was developed to perform a cost-utility 
analysis of extending the use of incobotulinumtoxin-A beyond the current 
restriction of four treatment cycles among patients who have shown a successful 
response in previous treatment cycles ('known responders'). The Markov model 
followed patients in 12-weekly cycles for 5 years, estimating the proportion of 
patients with or without response over this period in each of the modelled 
treatment arms. Post hoc analysis of an open-label extension phase study 
informed the Markov model. The perspective of the analysis was the Australian 
healthcare system, meaning only direct healthcare costs were included. Utility 
values by response status were derived from EQ-5D data from a published 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The primary outcome measure was the 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The open-label extension study data demonstrated the probability of 
treatment response after four injections was greater among 'known responders' 
than those without prior response. The incremental cost per QALY gained of 
continued use of incobotulinumtoxin-A beyond the current restriction of four 
treatments was A$59,911.
CONCLUSION: Limiting BoNT-A treatment to four cycles per patient per lifetime is 
likely to be suboptimal in many patients with PSS-UL. Treatment response beyond 
four cycles is highest among known responders, and allowing such patients to 
continue treatment beyond four cycles appears cost effective.

Planarians are on the rise as a model system for regeneration and stem cell 
dynamics. Almost in parallel the interest in planarian field biology has 
declined. Besides representing an independent research discipline in its own 
right, understanding of the natural habitat is also directly relevant to 
optimizing culture conditions in the laboratory. Moreover, the current 
laboratory models are but few of hundreds of planarian species worldwide. Their 
adaptation to a wide range of ecological niches has resulted in a fascinating 
diversity of regenerative abilities, body size, reproduction strategies, and 
life expectancy, to name just a few. With the currently ongoing establishment of 
large planarian species collections, such phenotypic diversity becomes 
accessible to comparative mechanistic analysis in the laboratory. Overall, we 
hope that this chapter inspires an integral view of the planarian model system 
that not only includes the molecular and cellular processes under investigation 
but also the evolutionary forces that shaped them in the first place.

OBJECTIVES: The increase in the average life expectancy entails elderly and 
chronic patients as hospital users, often dependents and requiring recurrent 
hospitalizations. In this framework, an innovative model of care management is 
essential to ensure appropriateness and sustainability of health services.
METHODS: A highly specialized care-related prevention-treatment-rehabilitation 
approach in which pharmacological, surgical, physical and intellectual 
disability therapies coexist in a synergistic manner, is the answer to this new 
emerging need. It offers interdisciplinary care pathways facing both disease and 
disability recognized by severity through ICD and ICF.
RESULTS: Measuring functional status related quality of life is a main outcome 
to be primarily pursued for complicated chronic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of "need-adapted" pathways agreed within 
multidisciplinary teams is the key feature of this new clinical model that can 
take advantage of data mining tools combining medical know-how and diagnostic 
information.

Publisher: L’utenza ospedaliera è sempre più caratterizzata da pazienti anziani 
e cronici, spesso non-autosufficienti e con ricorso a ricoveri ripetuti. In 
questo contesto diventa indispensabile un approccio clinico e gestionale 
innovativo che assicuri l’appropriatezza e la sostenibilità dei servizi 
sanitari. Le medicine specialistiche riabilitative delle cure correlate, intese 
come compatibilità e sinergia di terapie farmacologiche, interventistiche e 
plastico-funzionali, rappresentano la risposta a questo nuovo bisogno, 
attraverso percorsi di cura interdisciplinari delle malattie e delle disabilità 
diagnosticate per gravità con ICD e ICF. L’autonomia della persona alla base 
della qualità di vita rappresenta l’esito misurabile da perseguire primariamente 
per i pazienti cronici complessi. L’applicazione dei percorsiprotocolli, 
“adattati” ai bisogni del paziente e condivisi da equipe multidisciplinari, è 
l’elemento imprescindibile di questo nuovo modello clinico realizzabile grazie 
agli strumenti gestionali informatici delle moli di conoscenze mediche e di 
informazioni diagnostico-terapeutiche a disposizione.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the contribution of chronic conditions to 
gender differences in disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and life expectancy 
with disability (LED) in Belgium in 2001, 2004 and 2008.
METHODS: Data on disability and chronic conditions from participants of the 
2001, 2004 and 2008 Health Interview Surveys in Belgium were used to estimate 
disability prevalence by cause using the attribution method. Disability 
prevalence was applied to life tables to estimate DFLE and LED using the 
Sullivan method. Decomposition techniques were used to assess the contribution 
of mortality and disability and further of causes of death and disability to 
gender disparities in DFLE and LED.
RESULTS: Higher LE, DFLE and LED were observed for women compared with men in 
all years studied. A decrease in the gender gap in LE (2001: 5.9; 2004: 5.6; 
2008: 5.3) was observed in our cross-sectional approach followed by a decrease 
in gender differences in DFLE (2001: 1.9; 2004: 1.3; 2008: 0.5) and increase in 
LED (2001: 4.0; 2004: 4.4; 2008: 4.8). The higher LED in women was attributed to 
their lower mortality due to lung/larynx/trachea cancer, ischaemic heart 
diseases, and external causes (2001 and 2004) and higher disability prevalence 
due to musculoskeletal conditions (2008). Higher DFLE was observed in women 
owing to their lower mortality from lung/larynx/trachea cancer, ischaemic heart 
diseases, digestive cancer and chronic respiratory diseases.
CONCLUSION: To promote healthy ageing of populations, priority should be given 
to reduce the LED disadvantage in women by targeting non-fatal diseases, such as 
musculoskeletal conditions.

OBJECTIVES: Most studies show that marriage conveys a survival advantage. 
Whether this is valid also for stroke patients is unclear. Results of studies 
have been inconsistent and conflicting.
MATERIAL & METHODS: We studied 1-week and 1-month stroke case-fatality in 
relation to marital status (married, unmarried, divorced, and widowed) in all 
patients admitted to hospital for incident stroke in Denmark during 2003-2012. 
We used information from Danish registries on stroke merged to information on 
age, sex, marital status, stroke severity, stroke subtype, socioeconomic status, 
cardiovascular risk profile, and causes of death. We studied deaths due to the 
index stroke within the first week and month after stroke. Multivariate Cox 
regression models were applied to estimate cause-specific hazards and relative 
risks.
RESULTS: We included 60507 patients with an incident stroke of which 51.19% were 
married, 9.47% were unmarried, 13.29% were divorced, and 26.05% were widowers. 
Death within the first week and first month was caused by stroke in 2110 (3.5%) 
and 3423 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Compared to married stroke patients, 
1-week/1-month case-fatality (by stroke) was lower for the unmarried (HR (hazard 
ratio):0.69/0.74), divorced (HR:0.69/0.72), and widowed (HR:0.80/0.74) men and 
the unmarried (HR:0.84/0.86), divorced (HR:0.82/0.80), and widowed 
(HR:0.87/0.88) women with stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: One-week and one-month case-fatality by stroke was lower among the 
unmarried, divorced, and widowed than among the married stroke patients. 
Selection by so-called mortality displacement linked to shorter life expectancy 
among divorced, widowed, and singles may explain our findings.

[The Multimorbid Patient: Use of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with

The Multimorbid Patient: Use of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Chronic 
Kidney Disease Abstract. Increasing life expectancy in Western countries is 
associated with a high prevalence of multiple chronic diseases which is defined 
by the term "multimorbidity". Many of these patients suffer from chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and thrombogenic comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation with 
the need for oral anticoagulation. For decades vitamin K antagonists have been 
exclusively prescribed for oral anticoagulation. However, due to altered 
pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of these drugs in CKD, a significant risk 
of bleeding exists. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants as a new and 
promising alternative to vitamin K antagonists was -especially for CKD patients 
- highly anticipated. However, data from randomized studies are missing for 
older patients with advanced CKD. Consequently, a careful evaluation of the 
risk-benefit ratio is recommended for this sensitive patient population.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Die zunehmende Lebenserwartung in den westlichen 
Ländern führt zu einer gleichzeitigen Zunahme chronischer Krankheiten, was mit 
«Multimorbidität» bezeichnet wird. Viele dieser Patienten leiden an chronischer 
Niereninsuffizienz (CKD) sowie thrombogenen Komorbiditäten wie z.B. 
Vorhofflimmern, weshalb eine orale Antikoagulation indiziert ist. Für lange Zeit 
standen lediglich die Vitamin-K-Antagonisten zur Verfügung. Aufgrund der unter 
anderem veränderten Pharmakokinetik sowie Bioverfügbarkeit dieser Medikamente 
bei CKD besteht jedoch gleichzeitig ein deutlich erhöhtes Blutungsrisiko. Die 
Einführung der direkten oralen Antikoagulanzien als neue und vielversprechende 
Alternative zu Vitamin-K-Antagonisten wurde daher insbesondere für die 
Population der CKD-Patienten mit grosser Spannung erwartet. Aufgrund der noch 
nicht ausreichenden Datenlage insbesondere bei älteren Patienten mit 
fortgeschrittener Niereninsuffizienz sollte das Risiko-Nutzen-Verhältnis vor 
Therapiebeginn sorgfältig evaluiert werden.

Niche modification is a process whereby the activity of organisms modifies their 
local environment creating new niches for other organisms. This process can have 
a substantial role in community assembly of gut microbial ecosystems due to 
their vast and complex metabolic activities. We studied the postprandial diurnal 
community oscillatory patterns of the rumen microbiome and showed that 
metabolites produced by the rumen microbiome condition its environment and lead 
to dramatic diurnal changes in community composition and function. After 
feeding, microbiome composition undergoes considerable change in its 
phylogenetic breadth manifested as a significant 3-5-fold change in the relative 
abundance of methanogenic archaea and main bacterial taxa such as Prevotella, in 
a manner that was independent of individual host variation and diet. These 
changes in community composition were accompanied by changes in pH and methane 
partial pressure, suggesting a strong functional connection. Notably, 
cross-incubation experiments combining metabolites and organisms from different 
diurnal time points showed that the metabolites released by microbes are 
sufficient to reproduce changes in community function comparable to those 
observed in vivo. These findings highlight microbiome niche modification as a 
deterministic process that drives diurnal community assembly via environmental 
filtering.

Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate: A Review in Paediatric ADHD.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (lisdexamfetamine; Elvanse®; Tyvense®), an 
orally-active dexamfetamine prodrug, is indicated in the EU for the treatment of 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children aged ≥ 6 years 
(including adolescents) when the response to previous methylphenidate (MPH) 
treatment is clinically inadequate. The original approval of the drug was based 
on the results of phase III trials in children and adolescents with ADHD who had 
an inadequate response to previous pharmacotherapy (e.g. MPH) or were treatment 
naïve. In these studies, short-term treatment with flexibly-dosed 
lisdexamfetamine demonstrated greater efficacy than atomoxetine, based on a 
prospective comparison, and osmotic-release oral system (OROS)-MPH, based on a 
post hoc comparison. Improvements in ADHD symptoms were accompanied by 
improvements in health-related quality of life and functioning that were 
maintained as long as treatment with lisdexamfetamine was continued in a 
long-term extension of one of these trials. In subsequent phase IV head-to-head 
studies in adolescents with ADHD and an inadequate response to previous 
pharmacotherapy, lisdexamfetamine demonstrated greater efficacy than OROS-MPH 
when both medications were force-titrated, but not when they were 
flexibly-titrated. Lisdexamfetamine was generally well tolerated, with an 
adverse event profile (e.g. decreased appetite, headache, weight reduction, 
insomnia and irritability) typical of that reported for other stimulants. Thus, 
lisdexamfetamine provides an alternative option for the treatment of children 
and/or adolescents with ADHD who have not responded adequately to previous ADHD 
pharmacotherapies.

AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of obinutuzumab in combination with 
bendamustine followed by obinituzumab maintenance (Obin-Benda) compared to 
bendamustine alone (Benda) in patients with refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) 
in a Norwegian setting.
METHODS: A three-state area-under-the-curve (AUC) model was developed. The 
states included were progression-free-survival (PFS), progressed disease (PD), 
and death. Each state had costs and utilities assigned to it. The pivotal phase 
III randomized controlled trial GADOLIN was used for clinical input in the model 
along with Norwegian cost estimates. The trial demonstrated that Obin-Benda 
improved overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 (95% CI 
0.47-0.96), and reduced the likelihood of progression or death (HR 0.52, 95% CI 
0.39-0.69) compared to Benda. The model used EQ-5D data collected in the GADOLIN 
trial, with UK tariffs assigned to the EQ-5D scores.
RESULTS: The total quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the patients on 
Obin-Benda were estimated to be 4.67, compared to 3.65 for Benda, while the 
total costs were estimated to be €98,849 and €51,570, respectively. Obin-Benda 
had an incremental gain of 1.02 QALYs compared to Benda, at an additional cost 
of €47,279. The estimated deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was €46,438 per QALY gained, while the probabilistic ICER was €46,887 per 
QALY gained (95% CI €34,772-€59,443). The results were robust to changes in 
various sensitivity and scenario analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness threshold in Norway is not public, but based 
on previous decisions it is estimated to be up to approximately €89,000 per QALY 
(NOK 800,000). The results of the analysis indicate that obinutuzumab in 
combination with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance may be 
cost-effective compared to bendamustine alone in Norway.

Cardiovascular disease in diabetes type 2: current concepts.

Rosengren A(1).

Sahlgrenska University Hospital, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Type 2 diabetes is a major and accelerating public health challenge. Between 
1980 and 2014, a period of just 35 years, the number of adults with diabetes 
globally is estimated to have increased from 108 to 422 million, due not only to 
sharply rising obesity rates, but also to increasing population size, longer 
life expectancy, and rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide. Overall, worldwide 
age-standardized adult diabetes prevalence doubled from 4.3% to 9.0% in men and 
from 5.0% to 7.9% in women. The largest increases in diabetes type 2 have been 
demonstrated in low- and middle-income countries, whilst rises in high-income 
countries have been less marked, or even flat. Diabetes type 2 rates in low- and 
middle-income countries now in many instances surpass those in high-income 
countries, in response to changes in lifestyle. One factor of particular concern 
are the large relative increases in type 2 diabetes amongst young individuals 
observed in many countries, their higher overall risk factor burden, long 
exposure to hyperglycaemia and greater risk of complications over the life 
course. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly found to be a heterogeneous condition, 
where risk of cardiovascular disease that traditionally has been estimated at 
2-4 times that of the nondiabetic population varies substantially with diabetes 
phenotype and accordingly diabetes does not confer the same increase in relative 
or absolute risk in all people. New research shows that excess risk varies 
substantially with type of outcome, age, glycaemic control, the presence of 
renal complications and other factors. Heart failure, previously less recognized 
that other cardiovascular conditions, is increasingly coming into focus, because 
of strong links with poor glycaemic control and obesity. The knowledge about 
risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetes is almost entirely derived from 
high-income countries, whereas there is comparatively very little data from low- 
and middle income countries, where the majority of persons with type 2 diabetes 
live, and where management in many cases is far from optimal. The reductions in 
cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality now observed in high-income 
countries are encouraging, because this reinforces the fact that improvement is 
possible and that a near-normal, or even normal life-expectancy can be achieved 
in subtypes of type 2 diabetes.

Tribhuvan University, Patan, Nepal.

Health System Development, Kathmandu, Nepal.

BACKGROUND: The right to health is a fundamental part of human rights. Ensuring 
right to health is not straightforward; there are several challenges. Factors 
such as capacity of right holders and duty-bearers and practices of providing 
and utilizing services among others determine to ensure health rights for the 
whole population.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the health policies 
and programs follow a human rights-based approach (HRBA) and assess the 
situation of rights to health among the poor and vulnerable population.
METHODS: The study assessed domestic instruments against human rights policies 
and analyzed the implementation status of the policies and programs. An 
analytical case study method is used by utilizing qualitative and quantitative 
data.
RESULTS: Around 90% medicines are available in the facilities; however, 22% of 
health worker posts are vacant. Persistence of unequal distribution of health 
facilities, high out-of-pocket payment, and cultural and language barriers does 
not ensure accessibility of health services. Acceptability of health-care 
services in terms of utilization rate and client satisfaction is improved after 
introduction of new policy. Nepal has made significant progress in improving 
maternal mortality ratio, infant/child mortality, immunization rates, and life 
expectancy at birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a progressive realization of the right to health is being 
achieved, more efforts are still needed to follow HRBA so as to achieve quality 
and equity in health-care services.

A case report: Pharmacology and resistance patterns of three generations of ALK 
inhibitors in metastatic inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma.

BACKGROUND: Little exists currently in research about the mechanisms of 
resistance of ALK inhibitors in inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma. It is 
known, however, that ALK gene rearrangements are common in inflammatory 
myofibroblastic tumors, similar to non-small cell lung cancer. In roughly 50% of 
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, gene rearrangement has been found to occur 
on chromosome 2 at band 2p23. In non-small cell lung cancer, it has been shown 
that about a third of patients who progress on the first generation ALK 
inhibitor, crizotinib develops mutations in the ALK kinase domain. The remaining 
two-thirds of patients tend to develop amplification of ALK or activation of 
alternative signaling pathways. Chromoplexy has also been described as a 
mechanism of resistance, where multiple closed chain rearrangements cause 
loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes and gain-in-function of oncogenic 
fusions. Partner genes that have been identified in IMTs are tropomyosin 3 
(TPM3), tropomyosin 4 (TPM4), clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), Ran-binding protein 2 
(RANBP2), cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), and SEC31L1. All are 
active promoters for the fusion gene, in response to NPM binding. Several 
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor case reports indicated that fusion of ALK and 
RANBP2 led to a more aggressive clinical course. Although the majority of 
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor case reports have utilized first and second 
generation ALK inhibitors, all generations of ALK inhibitors have demonstrated 
some ability to impair disease progression and extend life expectancy. However, 
at some point in the course of therapy with each generation of ALK inhibitor, 
resistance ultimately developed. In order to better understand the pharmacology 
and resistance patterns behind three generations of ALK inhibitors, we sought to 
examine a patient with metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1-rearranged 
inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma to the brain. We also explored the 
similarities and differences of this clinical case to other inflammatory 
myofibroblastic sarcoma case reports involving the use of ALK inhibitors.
CASE REPORT: A rare case of pulmonary IMS with ALK-1 gene rearrangement and 
multiple brain metastases responded to three generations of ALK inhibitors. 
However, similar to other case reports, due to the development of resistance and 
recurrence, the patient eventually succumbed to the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: ALK inhibitors are beneficial in the temporary prevention of 
progression of disease in patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. In 
this case, due to the inability to reveal the fusion partner in this patient via 
DNA sequencing, it is unknown exactly if that partner was RANBP2 or another ALK 
partner gene. Brain biopsy tissue was also unobtainable during sequence of ALK 
due to risk versus benefit, which would have provided insight as which type of 
ALK resistance mutations the patient was developing. It is likely that this 
patient had some form of chromoplexy occurring.
