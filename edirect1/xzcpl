PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an overview of the risk relationships between 
alcohol use and cancer and of the alcohol-attributable cancer burden; to 
highlight areas of controversy in the alcohol-cancer relationship; to examine 
the reasons why these risk relationships have not received greater public 
attention.
RECENT FINDINGS: In 2016, alcohol caused an estimated 376,200 cancer deaths, 
10.0 million cancer years of life lost (YLLs), 236,600 cancer years lived with 
disability (YLDs), and 10.3 million cancer disability-adjusted years of life 
(DALYs), representing 4.2%, 4.2%, 4.6%, and 4.2% of all deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and 
DALYs lost due to cancer, respectively, proportionally highest in high- and 
upper-middle-income countries. Alcohol use is a major contributor to cancer and 
is linked to the most prevalent types of cancer. No threshold for the effects of 
alcohol on cancer has yet been identified, and thus, abstinence is best for 
cancer prevention. Greater public awareness of the relationship between alcohol 
use and cancer is advisable.

As part of its Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer (Merck Sharp & 
Dohme; MSD) of pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) to submit evidence of its clinical and 
cost effectiveness for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (RRcHL) who did not respond to treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with 
Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as the 
independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed review of 
the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on 
the company's submission to NICE. According to the NICE scope, pembrolizumab was 
compared with single or combination chemotherapy. Comparisons were undertaken in 
two populations: patients who did and did not receive prior autologous stem cell 
transplant (autoSCT; populations 1 and 2, respectively). Despite it having been 
recommended by NICE in population 1 at the time the ERG received the company 
submission, nivolumab was not included as a comparator. No studies directly 
comparing pembrolizumab and its comparators were identified. One ongoing, 
single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-087) and 
one comparative observational study (Cheah et al., 2016) were used to inform the 
comparative effectiveness of pembrolizumab and standard of care (SoC), using 
indirect comparisons in both populations. Almost all analyses showed significant 
PFS and overall response rate benefits for pembrolizumab versus SoC, but due to 
being based on indirect comparison, were likely to contain systematic error. The 
economic evaluation therefore suffered from substantial uncertainty in any 
estimates of cost effectiveness. Furthermore, there was a lack of evidence on 
the uptake and timing of allogeneic stem cell transplant, and alternative 
assumptions had a significant impact on cost effectiveness. Immature survival 
data from KEYNOTE-087 exacerbated this issue and necessitated the use of 
alternative data sources for longer-term extrapolation of survival. Some issues 
identified in the company's analyses were amended by the ERG. The revised ERG 
deterministic base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on the 
company's second Appraisal Consultation Document response for pembrolizumab 
versus SoC (with a commercial access agreement) for populations 1 and 2 were 
£54,325 and £62,527 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. There 
was substantial uncertainty around these ICERs, especially in population 2. NICE 
did not recommend pembrolizumab as an option for treating RRcHL in population 1, 
but recommended pembrolizumab for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund in population 
2.

Management of male pelvic fracture urethral injuries: Review and current topics.

Japan.

Pelvic fractures from high-energy blunt force trauma can cause injury to the 
posterior urethra, known as pelvic fracture urethral injury, which is most 
commonly associated with unstable pelvic fractures. Pelvic fracture urethral 
injury should be suspected if a patient with pelvic trauma has blood at the 
meatus and/or difficulty voiding, and retrograde urethrography should be carried 
out if the patient is stable. Once urethral injury is confirmed, urinary 
drainage should be established promptly by placement of a suprapubic tube or 
primary realignment of the urethra over a urethral catheter. Although pelvic 
fracture urethral injury is accompanied by subsequent urethral stenosis in a 
high rate and it has been believed that primary realignment can reduce the risk 
of developing urethra stenosis, it also has a risk of complicating stenosis and 
its clinical significance remains controversial. Once inflammation and fibrosis 
have stabilized (generally at least 3 months after the trauma), the optimal 
management for the resulting urethral stenosis is delayed urethroplasty. Delayed 
urethroplasty can be carried out via a perineal approach using four ancillary 
techniques in steps (bulbar urethral mobilization, corporal separation, inferior 
pubectomy and urethral rerouting). Although pelvic trauma can impair continence 
mechanisms, the continence after repair of pelvic fracture urethral injury is 
reportedly adequate. Because erectile dysfunction is frequently encountered 
after pelvic fracture urethral injury and most patients are young with a 
significant life expectancy, its appropriate management can greatly improve 
quality of life. In the present article, the key factors in the management of 
pelvic fracture urethral injury are reviewed and current topics are summarized.

Most harvested fruits and vegetables cannot be stored in natural conditions for 
a satisfactory shelf life duration due to their perishable nature. There are 
conventional preservation methods but have the limitations of high production 
cost and/or unsatisfactory shelf-life and/or undesirable residue, etc. Because 
of a number of unique properties, nanotechnology-related shelf life extension 
strategies have the potential to compensate the shortcomings of traditional 
preservation methods. In this review article, basic principles and recent highly 
efficient applications of nanotechnology-related shelf life extension strategies 
in fruits and vegetables are described. Data analysis of these strategies are 
carried out to make readers more intuitive to the research status. Finally, the 
recommendations for future research of nanotechnology in fruits and vegetables 
shelf life extension are discussed. According to statistical data, nano-zinc 
dioxide is the most mentioned nanomaterials in the references, followed by 
silver nano particles. Nanotechnology-related combined preservation strategies 
and nanotechnology-related intelligent labeling system are considered as 
valuable areas for future researches. In addition, modeling studies, legal 
aspects, safety concerns, cost-benefit analyses and technical optimization need 
to be taken into account in future researches.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Initial symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency 
(MSD) can develop from infancy through early childhood, and presentation is 
widely variable. Some individuals display the multisystemic features 
characteristic of mucopolysaccharidosis disorders (e.g., developmental 
regression, organomegaly, skeletal deformities) while other individuals present 
primarily with neurologic regression (associated with leukodystrophy). Based on 
age of onset, rate of progression, and disease severity, several different 
clinical subtypes of MSD have been described: Neonatal MSD is the most severe 
with presentation in the prenatal period or at birth with rapid progression and 
death occurring within the first two years of life. Infantile MSD is the most 
common variant and may be characterized as attenuated (slower clinical course 
with cognitive disability and neurodegeneration identified in the 2nd year of 
life) or severe (loss of the majority of developmental milestones by age 5 
years). Juvenile MSD is the rarest subtype with later onset of symptoms and 
subacute clinical presentation. Many of the features found in MSD are 
progressive, including neurologic deterioration, heart disease, hearing loss, 
and airway compromise.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of multiple sulfatase deficiency is established 
in a proband with low activity levels in at least two sulfatase enzymes and/or 
biallelic pathogenic variants in SUMF1 identified by molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Progressive hydrocephalus, seizures, 
spasticity, spine instability or stenosis, eye anomalies, cardiovascular 
disease, hearing loss, poor growth, dental anomalies, developmental delays, and 
respiratory issues are managed in the standard fashion. Obstructive sleep apnea 
may be treated with adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy, although affected 
individuals have a higher surgical complication rate; ventilator support (CPAP, 
BiPAP) can also be considered. Precautions are needed during anesthesia to 
address airway maintenance, as progressive upper airway obstruction and cervical 
spine instability are common. Poor bone health may require supplementation with 
vitamin D and encouragement of weight-bearing exercises. Alternative routes for 
nutrition (tube feeding) are frequently necessary. Surveillance: Monitoring of 
head circumference at each visit; serial brain/spine imaging, as needed based on 
symptoms; cervical spine imaging prior to any procedure that requires neck 
extension. At least annual vitamin D level, eye examination with intraocular 
pressure measurement, EKG, echocardiogram, and audiology evaluation. Abdominal 
ultrasound, sleep study and pulmonary function tests, neuropsychiatric testing, 
and assessment of blood and urine acid-base balance as clinically indicated. 
Agents/circumstances to avoid: Neck hyperextension (including hyperextension 
used for intubation) because of the risk of spinal cord compression; foods that 
are a choking hazard.
GENETIC COUNSELING: Multiple sulfatase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal 
recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% 
change of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 
25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk 
family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are 
possible using molecular genetic techniques if the pathogenic variants in the 
family are known.

The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process 
that often relates to nations economic growth. Some decades ago many authors, in 
the absence of other available indicators, used to rely on certain measures of 
human capital such as years of schooling, enrollment rates, or literacy. In this 
paper, we show that the predictive power of years of education as a proxy for 
human capital started to dwindle in 1990 when the schooling of nations began to 
be homogenized. We developed a structural equation model that estimates a metric 
of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of education and 
remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested with both 
cross-section data and panel data.

Is Life Expectancy of French Women Going to Plateau and Oscillate?

Some authors have hypothesised that life expectancy at birth could reach 100 
years in developed countries in the next decades. Using recent data for French 
women, it is shown that life expectancy changes from 1993 to 2016 are mainly 
linked to mortality rates of oldest women. In recent years, it happened that 
life expectancy of French women oscillated, because of for instance influenza 
epidemics killing mainly oldest frail people. It is hypothesised that in coming 
years, life expectancy of French women (and one day of men?) will only very 
slightly increase and will show oscillations because of increased mortality the 
years of severe influenza, heatwave and other events threatening the life of 
frail oldest people. This fate could also be that of the other developed 
countries in the future, which would mean that life expectancy has begun to 
plateau.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults 65 years 
and older and those younger than 65 years with clinical indications (eg, 
diabetes, lung/heart disease, kidney failure, and nephrotic syndrome). Its 
cost-effectiveness in less severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 
uncharacterized.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING & POPULATION: US adults aged 50 to 64 and 65 to 79 years stratified by 
CKD risk status: no CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate≥60mL/min/1.73m2 
and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio<30mg/g), CKD with moderate risk, CKD with 
high risk, and kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration 
rate<15mL/min/1.73m2) or nephrotic-range albuminuria (urinary albumin-creatinine 
ratio≥2,000mg/g). Data sources were the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.
INTERVENTION(S): Vaccination compared to no vaccination.
OUTCOMES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on US dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Markov model, US health sector perspective, and 
lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: The prevalence of pneumococcal vaccination in NHANES 1999 to 2004 was 
56.6% (aged 65-79 years), 28.5% (aged 50-64 years with an indication), and 9.7% 
(aged 50-64 years without an indication), with similar prevalences across CKD 
risk status. Pneumococcal vaccination was overall cost-effective (<US 
$100,000/QALY) for adults aged 65 to 79 years (US $15,000/QALY) and 50 to 64 
years (US $38,000/QALY). Among those aged 50 to 64 years, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were lowest for kidney failure or nephrotic-range 
albuminuria (US $1,000/QALY), followed by CKD with high risk (US $17,000/QALY), 
CKD with moderate risk (US $25,000/QALY), and no CKD (US $43,000/QALY). 
Pneumococcal vaccination was cost-effective among adults aged 50 to 64 years 
with CKD even when assuming the lowest vaccine efficacy or 50% higher vaccine 
costs.
LIMITATIONS: Some model parameters were based on data from the general 
population. Analysis did not consider costs associated with kidney disease 
progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of pneumococcal vaccination should be improved in general. 
Our results also suggest the cost-effectiveness of expanding its indication to 
younger adults with CKD less severe than kidney failure or nephrotic syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: With data on frequency of hearing loss in Russia and Eastern Europe 
generally lacking, we assessed the prevalence of hearing loss in a Russian 
population.
SETTING: The population-based Ural Eye and Medical Study was conducted in the 
rural and urban regions of Bashkortostan, Russia.
PARTICIPANTS: With an inclusion criterion of age 40+ years, the study included 
5899 (80.5%) out of 7328 eligible individuals (mean age: 59.0±10.7 years; range: 
40-94 years).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Hearing loss was examined in 5397 
(91.5%) study participants, assessed using a standardised interview with 
questions from the 'Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Version 
(HHIE-S)'.
RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported hearing loss (26.1%, 95% CI 24.2 to 
27.2) increased from 10.9% (95% CI 8.0 to 13.7) in participants aged 40-45 years 
old to 59.0% (95% CI 51.6 to 66.4) in those aged 80+ years old. It was higher 
for men than for women in the 60-80 years age group (38.93%, 95% CI 35.8 to 
42.1, vs 32.8%, 95% CI 30.2 to 35.3; p=0.003). On multivariable analysis, higher 
prevalence of hearing loss was associated with older age (p<0.001; OR [per year 
of age]: 1.06 [1.06 to 1.07]), male gender (p<0.001; OR: 1.26 [1.09 to 1.47]), 
higher depression score (p<0.001; OR: 1.06 [1.04 to 1.08]), higher prevalence of 
headache (p=0.001; OR: 1.27 [1.10 to 1.47]), history of cardiovascular diseases 
including stroke (p=0.001; OR: 1.32 [1.13 to 1.55]), and osteoarthritis 
(p<0.001; OR: 1.40 [1.18 to 1.67]), physically vigorous activity during work 
(p<0.001; OR: 1.40 [1.21 to 1.62]), alcohol consumption (p<0.001; OR: 1.51 [1.28 
to 1.78]), and dry eye feeling (p<0.001; OR: 1.67 [1.30 to 2.16]). It was 
marginally correlated with a higher anxiety score (p=0.07; OR: 1.03 [0.998 to 
1.06]). It was independent of diabetes (p=0.52), arterial hypertension (p=0.20), 
level of education (p=0.11), region of habitation (p=0.70), blood concentration 
of high-density lipoproteins (p=0.17) and low-density lipoproteins (p=0.52), 
current smoking (p=0.95) and smoking pack-years (p=0.37), and best corrected 
visual acuity (p=0.93).
CONCLUSIONS: As in other countries the prevalence of hearing loss is high in 
this elderly population in Russia. It is primarily or secondarily associated 
with older age, depression, male gender, cardiovascular disease and alcohol 
consumption.

BACKGROUND: Radical hysterectomy and complete pelvic lymphadenectomies are the 
most commonly performed procedures for women with early-stage cervical cancer. 
Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping could be an alternative to routine pelvic 
lymphadenectomy, aiming to diagnose accurately nodal extension and decrease 
lymphatic morbidity.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To compare 3-year disease-free survival and health-related 
quality of life after SLN biopsy or SLN biopsy + pelvic lymphadenectomy in early 
cervical cancer.
STUDY HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that disease-free survival is non-inferior and 
health-related quality of life superior after SLN biopsy compared with SLN 
biopsy + pelvic lymphadenectomy.
TRIAL DESIGN: International, randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial. The 
study will be run by teams trained to carry out SLN biopsy, belonging to 
clinical research cooperative groups or recognized as experts in this field. 
Patients with an optimal mapping (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] 
criteria) and a negative frozen section will be randomized 1:1 to SLN biopsy 
only or SLN biopsy + pelvic lymphadenectomy.
INCLUSION, EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with early stages (Ia1 with 
lymphovascular invasion to IIa1) of disease. Histological types are limited to 
squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma.

Apis mellifera jemenitica is the indigenous race of honey bees in the Arabian 
Peninsula and is tolerant to local drought conditions. Experiments were 
undertaken to determine the differences in associative learning and memory of 
honey bee workers living in the arid zone of Saudi Arabia, utilizing the 
proboscis extension response (PER). These experiments were conducted on the 
indigenous race (A. m. jemenitica) along with two introduced European races (A. 
m. carnica and A. m. ligustica). The data revealed that A. m. jemenitica is 
amenable to PER conditioning and may be used in conditioning experiments within 
the olfactory behavioral paradigm. The results also demonstrated that the three 
races learn and retain information with different capacities relative to each 
other during the experimental time periods. Native Arabian bees (A. m. 
jemenitica) exhibited significantly lower PER percentage during second and third 
conditioning trials when compared to exotic races. Apis mellifera jemenitica 
also exhibited reduced memory retention at 2 h and 24 h when compared to A. m. 
carnica and A. m. ligustica. Therefore, the native Arabian bees were relatively 
slow learners with reduced memory retention compared to the other two races that 
showed similar learning and memory retention. Three or five conditioning trials 
and monthly weather conditions (October and December) had no significant effects 
on learning and memory in A. m. jemenitica. These results emphasized a novel 
line of research to explore the mechanism and differences in associative 
learning as well as other forms of learning throughout the year among bee races 
in the harsh arid conditions of Saudi Arabia. This is the first study in Saudi 
Arabia to demonstrate inter-race differences regarding olfactory associative 
learning between native Arabian bees and two introduced European honey bee 
races.

Potential constraints on protocell size are developed from simple entropic 
considerations. To do that, two new different indexes as measures of their 
structural and dynamic order were developed and applied to an elemental model of 
the heterotrophic protocell. According to our results, cell size should be a key 
factor determining the potential of these primitive systems to evolve and 
consequently to support life. Our analyses also suggest that the size of the 
optimal vesicles could be constrained to have radii in the interval [Formula: 
see text], where the two extreme limits [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see 
text] represent the states of maximum structural order (largest accumulation of 
substrate inside the vesicle) and the maximum flux of entropy production, 
respectively. According to the above criteria, the size of the optimum vesicles 
falls, approximately, in the same spatial range estimated for biological living 
cells assuming plausible values for the second-order rate constant involved in 
the catabolic process. Furthermore, the existence of very small vesicles could 
be seriously affected by the limited efficiency, far from the theoretical 
limits, with which these catabolic processes may proceed in a prebiotic system.

INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of alectinib versus crizotinib as 
first-line treatments for advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from the perspective of China's 
healthcare system.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the clinical outcomes and costs 
of alectinib and crizotinib, which included five health states: progression-free 
(PF) without central nervous system (CNS) progression, PF with CNS progression, 
post-progression (PP) without CNS progression, PP with CNS progression, and 
death. Clinical data for transition probabilities were obtained from the ALEX 
trial at the updated data cutoff. Healthcare resource utilization and costs were 
derived from clinical expert opinions and published literature. One-way 
sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to 
assess the uncertainty of the results. Scenario analyses were conducted 
including using clinical data from the ALESIA trial in Asian patients, using 
utilities from the ALEX trial, and choosing different parametric survival 
models.
RESULTS: In base case analysis, alectinib yielded an additional 1.04 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with incremental costs of $54,827, resulting 
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $52,869/QALY. In scenario 
analysis, the ICER was $56,787/QALY using clinical data from the ALESIA trial. 
In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probabilities of alectinib being 
cost-effective were 0.4% and 43.7% when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds 
were $28,109/QALY and $50,000/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Alectinib could prolong the mean time of PF and delay the time to 
CNS progression. However, because of its high drug cost, alectinib was unlikely 
to be cost-effective for untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients in China.

S-DNA (stretched DNA) is an elongated base-paired DNA conformation under high 
tension. Because the RecA/Rad51 family DNA recombinases form helical filaments 
on DNA and mediate the formation of the DNA triplex (D-loop), in which the DNA 
is stretched, and because the extension of these nucleoprotein filaments is 
similar to the extension of S-DNA, S-DNA has long been hypothesized as a 
possible state of DNA that participants in RecA/Rad51-mediated DNA strand 
exchange in homologous recombination. Such a hypothesis, however, is still 
lacking direct experimental studies. In this work, we have studied the 
polymerization and strand exchange on S-DNA mediated by Escherichia coli RecA, 
human Rad51, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 by single-molecule magnetic 
tweezers. We report that RecA/Rad51 polymerizes faster on S-DNA than on B-DNA 
with the same buffer conditions. Furthermore, the RecA/Rad51-mediated DNA 
triplex forms faster from S-DNA than from B-DNA together with the homologous 
single-stranded DNA. These results provide evidence that S-DNA can interact with 
RecA and Rad51 and shed light on the possible functions of S-DNA.

BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been recommended for 
multi-trauma patients, but there is only low-quality evidence to support its use 
with these patients. This study examined whether a Supported Fast track 
multi-Trauma Rehabilitation Service (Fast Track) was cost-effective compared to 
conventional trauma rehabilitation service (Care As Usual) in patients with 
multi-trauma from a societal perspective with a one-year follow-up.
METHODS: An economic evaluation alongside a prospective, multi-center, 
non-randomized, controlled clinical study, was conducted in the Netherlands. The 
primary outcome measure was the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Generic 
Quality of Life and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of the patients were 
derived using the Short-form 36 Health Status Questionnaire. Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were stated in terms of costs per unit of FIM 
improvement and costs per QALY. To investigate the uncertainty around the ICERs, 
non-parametric bootstrapping was used.
RESULTS: In total, 132 patients participated, 65 Fast Track patients and 67 Care 
As Usual patients. Mean total costs per person were €18,918 higher in the Fast 
Track group than in the Care As Usual group. Average incremental effects on the 
FIM were 3.7 points (in favor of the Fast Track group) and the incremental 
(extra) bootstrapped costs were €19,033, resulting in an ICER for cost per FIM 
improvement of €5,177. Care As Usual dominated Fast Track in cost per QALY as it 
gave both higher QALYs and lower costs. All sensitivity analyses attested to the 
robustness of our results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation 
program for multi-trauma patients according to the supported fast track 
principle is promising but cost-effectiveness evidence remains inconclusive. In 
terms of functional outcome, Fast Track was more expensive but yielded also more 
effects compared to the Care As Usual group. Looking at the costs per QALYs, 
unfavorable ICERs were found. Given the lack of a willingness-to-pay threshold 
for functional recovery and the relatively short time horizon, it is not 
possible to draw firm conclusions about the first.

Cost-utility analysis (CUA) is a widely recommended form of health economic 
evaluation worldwide. The outcome measure in CUA is quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), which are calculated using health state utility values (HSUVs) and 
corresponding life-years. Therefore, HSUVs play a significant role in 
determining cost-effectiveness. Formal adoption and endorsement of CUAs by 
reimbursement authorities motivates methodological advancement in HSUV 
measurement and application. A large body of evidence exploring various methods 
in measuring HSUVs has accumulated, imposing challenges for investigators in 
identifying and applying HSUVs to CUAs. First, large variations in HSUVs between 
studies are often reported, and these may lead to different cost-effectiveness 
conclusions. Second, issues concerning the quality of studies that generate 
HSUVs are increasingly highlighted in the literature. This issue is compounded 
by the limited published guidance and methodological standards for assessing the 
quality of these studies. Third, reimbursement decision making is a 
context-specific process. Therefore, while an HSUV study may be of high quality, 
it is not necessarily appropriate for use in all reimbursement jurisdictions. To 
address these issues, by promoting a systematic approach to study 
identification, critical appraisal, and appropriate use, we are developing the 
Health Utility Book (HUB). The HUB consists of an HSUV registry, a quality 
assessment tool for health utility studies, and a checklist for interpreting 
their use in CUAs. We anticipate that the HUB will make a timely and important 
contribution to the rigorous conduct and proper use of health utility studies 
for reimbursement decision making. In this way, health care resource allocation 
informed by HSUVs may reflect the preferences of the public, improve health 
outcomes of patients, and maintain the efficiency of health care systems.

BACKGROUND: Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas are highly malignant tumors 
with both adenocarcinomatous and neuroendocrine components. They can originate 
in any organ but are more common in the rectum. Due to their rarity, current 
treatment recommendations for mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma are based on 
limited data and follow general guidelines for the management of adenocarcinomas 
and neuroendocrine neoplasms. Uncertainty regarding the efficacy of the 
available local and systemic treatment strategies is a compounding issue. Even 
those patients with locally limited disease have a relatively short life 
expectancy. In this report, we describe a case of deep rectal mixed 
adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma with long survival after chemoradiation.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old Caucasian woman was diagnosed with a grade 3 
rectal adenocarcinoma combined with a poorly differentiated large cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma component and synchronous metastases (cT3cN1cM1) in 
both lobes of the liver in 2012. She received concomitant chemoradiotherapy 
followed by four additional cycles of cisplatin plus irinotecan. Initial 
treatment induced complete remission of the rectal tumor and liver metastases. 
Consequently, it was not necessary to surgically resect the primary tumor or any 
of the metastases. Three months after the end of treatment, one metastasis in 
the first segment of the liver showed regrowth, and stereotactic body 
radiotherapy of the metastasis and chemotherapy resulted in a clinical complete 
response. The patient has been recurrence-free for more than 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Extended long-term control of a poorly differentiated metastatic 
(stage IV) mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma is rare. The multimodal first- 
and second-line regimens of radiotherapy and chemotherapy described in this case 
report represent a new therapeutic approach. Encouraged by the results in this 
case, we compiled a review of the literature on mixed adenoneuroendocrine 
carcinoma.

Osteoporosis and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) are both age-related 
diseases of the musculoskeletal system. With the average life expectancy longer 
than ever, the morbidity caused by these two diseases is increasing. Nowadays, 
treatment strategies for osteoporosis are mainly aimed at increasing the mineral 
density of the bone. Some of these therapies, including vitamin D, calcium, 
bisphosphonates, Wnt signal activators and parathyroid hormone regulators, have 
been suggested to be capable of causing calcification of the cartilage endplate 
in the intervertebral disc. This alteration could block nutrient and oxygen 
transportation to the center part of the disc, thus lead to intervertebral disc 
degeneration. Consequently, we hypothesize that osteoporosis therapies might be 
a potential risk for IDD. This assumption indicates that we should take the 
alterations of the cartilage endplate into consideration in further osteoporosis 
treatment to avoid IDD in the patient.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The study of human aging contributes to disease 
prevention, treatment and life extension. Recently, epigenetics studies have 
evidenced that there is a close association between DNA methylation and human 
ages. A quantitatively statistical modeling between DNA methylation and ages 
could predict the person's age more accurately.
METHODS: We propose a regression model to predict human age based on gradient 
boosting regressor (GBR). We collect a total of 1280 publicly available 
non-blood tissues samples with ages ranged from 0 to 90 years old. We calculate 
the Pearson correlation between CpG's DNA methylation level and age to select 
age-related CpGs.
RESULTS: Thirteen age-related CpG sites are selected. GBR has the smallest mean 
absolute deviation to the actual age comparing with other three different models 
including Bayesian ridge, multiple linear regression, and support vector 
regression. In the training datasets, the cross-validation results show that the 
correlation R2 between predicted age and DNA methylation is 0.89, and the mean 
absolute deviation is 4.66 years. In an independent testing set with 262 
samples, the GBR achieves the mean absolute deviation of 6.08 years. Meanwhile 
we also briefly describe the function of the selected thirteen CpG sites.
CONCLUSIONS: We build an age predictor to study the association between ages and 
the DNA methylation of human non-blood tissues. Our new model provides a more 
accurate estimation of human ages which will be instrumental for understanding 
the regulation of DNA methylation on human aging and will accurately monitor the 
individual aging process.

Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and 
antioxidants. Its post-harvest deterioration leads to a limited shelf-life up to 
5-7 days. To avoid such loss, the present study investigates the potential 
effect of starch glucose (SG) coating on the extension of its shelf-life, after 
harvest. 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 µM of starch with 2.5 µM D-glucose solutions were 
coated over freshly harvested cucumbers and stored at refrigerated temperature 
(±4 °C) for 30 days. 1.5 µM starch plus 2.5 µM D-glucose displayed significantly 
better results as per the skin colour and sensory evaluation test. This level of 
SG coating extended the shelf-life of cucumbers up to 30 days with least
