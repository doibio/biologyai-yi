The retina is the innermost layer in the eye that is responsible for the visual 
processing that turns light energy from photons into three-dimensional images. 
Located in the posterior portion of the eyeball, the retina is the only 
extension of the brain that can be viewed from the outside world and gives 
ophthalmologists a rare window into real-time pathology affecting the retina. 
Development of the retina is a long and complex process that begins during the 
fourth week of embryogenesis and continues into the first year of life. This 
long and complex embryonic development makes the retina vulnerable to genetic 
and environmental insults that can negatively affect retinal development. 
Retinal tissue develops to become the most metabolically expensive tissue in the 
human body, consuming oxygen more rapidly than any other tissue. The retina is 
fed oxygen from a unique dual blood supply that divides the retina into outer 
and inner layers for more efficient oxygenation. The retina itself consists of 
six different cell lines divided into ten different layers, each playing a 
specific role in creating and transmitting vision. The different cell types 
perform a particular role and form functional circuits that specialize in 
detecting specific variations and movements of light.

OBJECTIVES: Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) are 2 commonly ordered liver function tests, and ALT has long been 
considered more liver-specific than AST. Between the 2, the one which is better 
in predicting liver or non-liver-related mortality remains unsettled.
METHODS: The cohort, 416,122 adults, came from a self-paying comprehensive 
health surveillance program during 1994-2008 and was followed up till 2008. 
Mortality came from National Death Index, with 10,412 deaths identified. Hazard 
ratios (HRs), computed by Cox model, and life expectancy, by life table method, 
were presented for 5 levels of AST and ALT with elevated AST or ALT defined as 
≥40 IU/L. Liver disease included liver cancer and other liver conditions.
RESULTS: There were 3 times more elevated ALT (15.4%) than AST (5.7%). However, 
those with elevated AST had higher mortality for all-cause (HR = 2.44), for 
liver disease (HR = 27.2), and for liver cancer (HR = 47.6) than its ALT 
counterparts (HR = 1.69, 10.8, and 20.2, respectively). Elevated AST also lost 
more years of life expectancy (10.2) than those lost by ALT (5.2) and larger 
than most common risks. Elevated AST had increased mortality from all cancers 
(HR = 3.57), stroke (HR = 1.36), respiratory diseases (HR = 1.34), and injuries 
(HR = 1.82), other than just liver disease. All-cause mortality remained 
significantly increased, when high risk groups were excluded, such as frequent 
drinkers, hepatitis carriers, those died from nonmedical conditions, those died 
in the first 3 years, or advanced fibrosis index based on 4 factors or aspartate 
transaminase-to-platelet ratio index. Results were consistent between those 
returned for second visits and those analyzed in initial visits.
DISCUSSION: Those with elevated AST (≥40 IU/L) had life expectancy cut short by 
10.2 years, doubled the number of years lost with elevated ALT. For all-cause 
and for liver-related mortality, AST was an important predictor, better than 
ALT.

Facilitating Timely Advance Care Planning: Discussions in the Ambulatory Setting 
With a Heart Failure Population.

Gutierrez, PhD, RN, AHN-BC, is assistant professor, Department of Nursing, 
Metropolitan State University, St Paul, Minnesota.

This quality improvement project utilized a risk stratification process and an 
advance care planning (ACP) tool to identify patients at high risk of death and 
prompt ACP discussions and documentation of health care preferences in the 
electronic health record. Inherent uncertainty in heart failure (HF) 
prognostication and provider time constraints impede initiation of timely ACP 
discussions. In an effort to mitigate these obstacles, the Seattle Heart Failure 
Model was utilized to calculate mortality risk for 195 patients in an ambulatory 
HF clinic. Next, a HF-specific ACP tool, developed for this project, was used to 
prompt and guide ACP discussions with patients determined to have a prognosis of 
life expectancy of 3 years or less. The project yielded a 35% completion of ACP 
tools over 3 months, with 100% of these entered into the electronic health 
record. Postimplementation surveys suggest clinic staff believe a comprehensive 
and systematic approach to ACP services facilitates timely ACP discussions and 
decision making in the outpatient setting.

hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio after two hamstring strengthening exercise 
interventions in female hockey players. J Strength Cond Res 34(2): 396-405, 
2020-The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 hamstring 
strengthening interventions (Nordic hamstrings [NHE] vs. eccentric leg curl 
[ELC]) on the hamstring torque-angle profiles and functional 
hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio (Hecc:Qcon) in female hockey players. Female 
university-level players were randomly allocated to an NHE group (n = 9, 19.7 ± 
1.4 years; 168.4 ± 4.4 cm; 66.2 ± 7.2 kg, 26.0 ± 4.4%), an ELC group (n = 8, 
19.5 ± 1.0 years; 168.1 ± 3.4 cm; 66.7 ± 4.5 kg, 24.8 ± 3.5%), or a control (C) 
group (n = 8, 19.6 ± 1.4 years; 169.9 ± 7.5 cm; 70.7 ± 13.0 kg, 25.9 ± 5.2%). 
They performed baseline isokinetic concentric strength tests of the quadriceps 
(Qcon) and eccentric strength of the hamstrings (Hecc) at 120°·s, followed by a 
6-week intervention with exercises (NHE or ELC) performed 3 times weekly, before 
post-tests. Analyses of variance with repeated measures were used to assess the 
effects of knee position angle (from 90° of knee flexion to 10° close to 
extension), group, and time on Qcon, Hecc, and Hecc:Qcon. There were no 
interactions between independent variables. Significant increases in Hecc and 
Hecc:Qcon were shown after NHE (+29.9 and +27.8%) and ELC (+30.5 and +38.3%) in 
the nondominant leg only. Furthermore, significant shifts in the hamstring 
eccentric angle of peak torque toward a longer muscle length were shown in both 
legs (14.3-28.6%). These findings suggest that NHE and ELC both resulted in 
significant improvements in peak and muscle-length-specific neuromuscular risk 
factors in the nondominant (ND) limb, thereby reducing interlimb peak strength 
asymmetries. Strength and conditioning specialists could therefore use both the 
NHE and ELC exercises in female hockey players.

BACKGROUND: Off-label testosterone prescribing for androgen deficiency (AD)-like 
sexual and energy symptoms of older men without pathologic hypogonadism has 
increased dramatically without convincing evidence of efficacy.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with three 
phases, we entered 45 men aged at least 40 years without pathologic hypogonadism 
but with AD-like energy and/or sexual symptoms to either daily testosterone or 
placebo gel treatment for 6 weeks in a cross-over study design with a third, 
mandatory extension phase in which participants chose which previous treatment 
they preferred to repeat while remaining masked to their original treatment. 
Primary endpoints were energy and sexual symptoms as assessed by a visual analog 
scale (Lead Symptom Score [LSS]).
RESULTS: Increasing serum testosterone to the healthy young male range produced 
no significant benefit more than placebo for energy or sexual LSS. Covariate 
effects of age, body mass index, and pretreatment baseline serum testosterone on 
quality-of-life scales were detected. Only 1 out of 22 indices from seven 
quality-of-life scales was significantly improved by testosterone treatment over 
placebo. Participants did not choose testosterone significantly more than 
placebo as their preferred treatment in the third phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Six-week testosterone treatment does not improve energy or sexual 
symptoms more than placebo in symptomatic men without pathologic hypogonadism.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major health problem for morbidity and 
mortality world-wide due to diabetic vascular complication. Following T2DM, 
dyslipidemia is known well for the main reason of vascular complication leading 
to atherosclerosis and impaired life expectancy in diabetes. Thus, a new 
prediction marker in T2DM could help prevent the progression disease despite of 
metabolic control. Signal peptide-CUB-EGF like containing protein 2 (SCUBE2), 
has been detected in vascular endothelium and was affected by cytokines. 
Recently, SCUBE2 was reported to increase in atherosclerotic human coronary 
artery, involving vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages. The aims 
of this study were to examine the expression level of SCUBE2 in T2DM patients 
with dyslipidemia and its correlation with endothelial dysfunction marker, 
endothelin-1 (ET-1) in this group. This study design was cross sectional control 
study, recruited 28 patients diagnosed as T2DM who were found with dyslipidemia 
and 15 healthy control subjects. Our results showed that T2DM patients showed 
higher LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and ET-1 expression level compared to 
healthy subjects. Further, we found that SCUBE2 had strong correlation with ET-1 
in these dyslipidemic T2DM patients. In conclusion, our study confirmed first 
that SCUBE2 was upregulated in T2DM with dyslipidemia. Moreover, Pearson 
correlation analysis of ET-1 and SCUBE2 in this group showed high correlation 
r = 0.797, P < 0.001, suggesting that SCUBE2 may plausible target in vascular 
function changes in dyslipidemic T2DM. Improving our exploration of these 
findings may lead to uncover SCUBE2 involvement in diabetic vascular 
complication in T2DM.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Continuous Versus Intermittent Renal Replacement 
Therapies in Acute Kidney Injury: Perspective of the Social Services for the 
Elderly in Argentina.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a public health problem that affects 
millions of hospitalized patients worldwide. In Argentina, evidence suggests 
that its incidence has risen in recent years. When severe, AKI may require a 
renal replacement therapy (RRT) where continuous RRT (CRRT) and intermittent RRT 
(IRRT) are plausible options for patients in the intensive care unit.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost utility of CRRT versus IRRT for the National 
Institute of Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners, the largest social 
security health insurance for elders in Argentina.
METHODS: This was a model-based cost-utility analysis. Long-term costs and 
health outcomes were estimated for a hypothetical cohort with a Markov model. 
Parameters used were obtained from published literature and validated with local 
experts. Local costs were estimated and expressed in $AR of 2016. Several 
sensitivity analyses were run to analyze the impact of uncertainty on results.
RESULTS: Continuous RRT dominated IRRT by cumulating over the model more 
quality-adjusted life years and less costs. Total discounted quality-adjusted 
life years for both cohorts were 1049 and 1034, respectively, and total costs 
were $95 362 and $103 871. Cost-effectiveness (CE) results reflect these 
differences in favor of CRRT with a deterministic cost-saving incremental CE 
ratio and a probability of CRRT being CE of 65.4%, considering a CE threshold of 
1 gross domestic product per capita.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous RRT for patients with AKI eligible for CRRT or IRRT 
would probably be a cost-effective intervention for the National Institute of 
Social Services for Retirees and Pensioners' view. Nevertheless, there is 
considerable uncertainty around results, mainly due to the lack of adequate 
controlled studies and local data on the prognosis of these patients in 
Argentina.

The oxidative stability of vegetable oils mainly depends on their fatty acid 
composition, their degree of unsaturation, and the presence of compounds with 
antioxidant activity. This paper reports on the effects of the process of 
roasting oil seeds, prior to pressing them, on the basic characteristics of the 
oils produced and their oxidative stability. The differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) technique was used to study the process of oxidation of the 
oil samples in an oxygen-flow cell. Chromatographic analysis revealed that 
roasting the seeds increased the levels of chlorophyll and β-carotene in all the 
cold-pressed oils. Similar results were observed for the oil's antioxidant 
activity, measured by the scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) 
radical method. Our results also indicated that roasting seeds prior to pressing 
them for oil had a positive effect on the oil's stability, as determined by the 
DSC method. This manifested in both the extension of oxidation induction time 
and the final oxidation time.

Objectives: We aimed to study the epidemiology, prevalence, incidence, clinical 
manifestations, underlying diseases, treatments, outcomes, and societal impact 
through disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of IA in Iran. Methods: A 
random-effect meta-analytic model was fitted to estimate the prevalence and 
incidence of IA in Iran. We also calculated DALYs. Results: Out of 79 published 
studies during the past 25 years from Iran, 23 met the inclusion criteria. A 
total of 2947 patients were included, of whom 396 (13.4%) patients were 
diagnosed with IA according to EORTC/MSG and ICU criteria. The main underlying 
condition for IA was hematologic disorders (39.4%). A. flavus 86 (43%) was the 
most common isolate. The pooled prevalence and incidence rates were 20.5 (95% CI 
12.5 to 29.9) and 4.8 (95% CI 2.3-8.2) per 100,000 population, respectively. 
Total DALYs was estimated 164.13 per 100,000 population. YLLs constitute the 
majority of IA burden compared to YLDs (162.80 YLLs/100,000 population vs 1.33 
YLDs per 100,000 population). The highest YLL rates were found in people aged 
45-49 (62.9 YLLs/100,000 population) and 30-34 years (45.2 YLLs/100,000 
population), respectively. Conclusion: This study indicates an increasing burden 
of IA in Iran, despite the extensive use of prophylaxis, challenging the public 
health, especially immunocompromised patients.

BACKGROUND: Medical Aid beneficiaries in Korea are more likely to have poor 
health status and to receive insufficient healthcare services, but their life 
expectancy has not been compared with that of National Health Insurance 
beneficiaries.
METHODS: We used the National Health Information Database in Korea to obtain 
aggregate data on the numbers of population and deaths according to calendar 
year (2004 to 2017), sex, age group, and insurance eligibility (Medical Aid or 
National Health Insurance). Between 2004 and 2017, a summed total of 697,503,634 
subjects (combining numbers of subjects for 14 years) and 3,536,778 deaths, 
including 22,417,216 Medical Aid beneficiaries and 499,604 associated deaths, 
were used to construct annual abridged life tables.
RESULTS: In 2017, the life expectancy of Medical Aid beneficiaries was 
70.9 years, while that of National Health Insurance beneficiaries was 
83.7 years. Between 2004 and 2017, life expectancy for Medical Aid beneficiaries 
increased by 8.7 years in men and 6.1 years in women, while life expectancy for 
National Health Insurance beneficiaries increased by 5.2 years in men and 
4.5 years in women. The life expectancy difference between National Health 
Insurance beneficiaries and Medical Aid beneficiaries was especially great among 
men across all study periods. The life expectancy difference was 15.8 years for 
men and 8.9 years for women in 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: The life expectancy of Medical Aid beneficiaries was shorter than 
that of National Health Insurance beneficiaries. The government should implement 
policies to deliver more adequate health care to Medical Aid beneficiaries.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a validated model for evaluating the real-world 
effectiveness of long-term clinical management strategies for women with 
germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed that included a BRCA-specific 
natural history for breast and ovarian cancer, a clinical framework for carrier 
follow-up, and cancer risk management strategies (breast screening, 
risk-reducing mastectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Adherence rates 
and outcomes for breast screening and risk-reducing surgery were obtained from 
BRCA carriers seen through a familial cancer service in Melbourne, Australia. 
The model was assessed for internal and external validity. The model was used to 
compare women perfectly adhering to screening recommendations versus actual 
adherence of the clinical cohort.
RESULTS: The model accurately predicted cancer incidence, pathology, and 
mortality. Using actual adherence for breast screening resulted in additional 
breast cancer deaths (per 1000 women: BRCA1, 2.7; BRCA2, 1.6) compared with 
perfect screening adherence. This decreased average life expectancy by 0.30 
life-years for BRCA1 and 0.07 life-years for BRCA2. When carriers had access to 
risk-reducing mastectomy, the benefit from improved screening adherence was not 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed model is a good descriptor of BRCA carriers' lifetime 
trajectory and its modification by use of risk management strategies alone or in 
combination. Evaluations of breast screening in BRCA carriers may overestimate 
the benefits of screening programs unless adherence is considered. By 
incorporating real-world clinical practice and patient behavior, this model can 
assist in developing clinical services and improving clinical outcomes for 
carriers.

BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) presents a significant economic 
burden to the healthcare system. Catheter ablations is a commonly adopted 
treatment for paroxysmal AF.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of cryoballoon ablation versus 
radiofrequency ablation in patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF in a 
tertiary hospital in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to study the effects and costs. Cost and 
probability input data were obtained mainly from a retrospective real-world 
study conducted in a tertiary hospital. Propensity score matching was used to 
overcome retrospective bias. Input data gaps were remedied by means of 
literature review and advice from experts. A simulation was performed for the 
post-procedure lifetime years. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were conducted.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis of a lifetime time horizon, a patient treated 
with cryoballoon ablation was associated with 7.85 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and ¥132 222 ($19 913) total costs, whereas a radiofrequency ablation 
treated patient was associated with 7.71 QALYs and ¥147 304 ($22 184) total 
costs. The cryoballoon group had slightly better health outcomes (with a 
difference of 0.14 QALY) and lower total costs (with a difference of ¥15 082) 
(USD $2 271), and it may be considered as cost-effective or cost-saving strategy 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio -¥110 158 [$16 590] per QALY) for the 
management of paroxysmal AF. Different scenarios were tested with sensitivity 
analyses, but still, the outcomes remained cost-effective or cost-saving for 
cryoballoon ablation.
CONCLUSIONS: An economic evaluation based on real-world data suggests that, 
relative to radiofrequency ablation, cryoballoon ablation may be considered as a 
more cost-effective or cost-saving long-term strategy for drug-refractory 
paroxysmal AF in this tertiary hospital in China. However, further evidence is 
needed using data from large-scale studies in order to reflect a national 
perspective.

Implications of Nonmarginal Budgetary Impacts in Health Technology Assessment: A 
Conceptual Model.

OBJECTIVES: This paper introduces a framework with which to conceptualize the 
decision-making process in health technology assessment for new interventions 
with high budgetary impacts. In such circumstances, the use of a single 
threshold based on the marginal productivity of the healthcare system is 
inappropriate. The implications of this for potential partial implementation, 
horizontal equity, and pharmaceutical pricing are illustrated using this 
framework.
RESULTS: Under the condition of perfect divisibility and given an objective of 
maximizing health, a large budgetary impact of a new treatment may imply that 
optimal implementation is partial rather than full, even at a given incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio that would nevertheless mean the decision to accept the 
treatment in full would not lead to a net reduction in health. In a one-shot 
price-setting game, this seems to give rise to potential horizontal equity 
concerns. When the assumption of fixity of the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (arising from the assumed exogeneity of the manufacturer's price) is 
relaxed, it can be shown that the threat of partial implementation may be 
sufficient to give rise to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at which cost 
the entire potential population is treated, maximizing health at an increased 
level, and with no contravention of the horizontal equity principle.

Incorporating Affordability Concerns Within Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for 
Health Technology Assessment.

Lomas JRS(1).

Electronic address: james.lomas@york.ac.uk.

BACKGROUND: Recent policy developments and journal articles have emphasized a 
divergence: when interventions are found to be cost-effective but unaffordable. 
This apparent paradox reflects a conventional practice of cost-effectiveness 
analysis that does not properly evaluate the opportunity costs of an 
intervention that imposes non-marginal costs on the healthcare system.
OBJECTIVE: Taking the perspective of an exogenously resource constrained 
decision maker, this paper presents a framework by which concerns for 
affordability can be appropriately incorporated within cost-effectiveness 
analysis.
METHODS: A net benefit framework is proposed where health opportunity costs are 
estimated for each simulation iteration within each time period. The framework 
is applied to a hypothetical case study based on the recent experience of the 
English NHS with new hepatitis C drugs.
RESULTS: Under the proposed framework, but not under conventional 
cost-effectiveness analysis, estimates of health opportunity costs differ 
between scenarios involving different profiles of budget impact even when their 
net present value, or expected value, are the same.
CONCLUSIONS: The framework presented here reflects the importance of the scale 
of budget impacts along with their uncertainty distribution and time profile. In 
doing so it resolves issues with the conduct of conventional cost-effectiveness 
analysis where affordability concerns are not explicitly incorporated.

OBJECTIVE: To derive a US-based value set for the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire using 
an international, standardized protocol developed by the EuroQol Group.
METHODS: Respondents from the US adult population were quota-sampled on the 
basis of age, sex, ethnicity, and race. Trained interviewers guided participants 
in completing composite time trade-off (cTTO) and discrete choice experiment 
(DCE) tasks using the EuroQol Valuation Technology software and routine quality 
control measures. Data were modeled using a Tobit model for cTTO data, a mixed 
logit model for DCE data, and a hybrid model that combined cTTO and DCE data. 
Model performance was compared on the basis of logical ordering of coefficients, 
statistical significance, parsimony, and theoretical considerations.
RESULTS: Of 1134 respondents, 1062, 1099, and 1102 respondents provided useable 
cTTO, DCE, and cTTO or DCE responses, respectively, on the basis of quality 
control criteria and interviewer judgment. Respondent demographic 
characteristics and health status were similar to the 2015 US Census. The Tobit 
model was selected as the preferred model to generate the value set. Values 
ranged from -0.573 (55 555) to 1 (11 111), with 20% of all predicted health 
states scores less than 0 (ie, worse than dead).
CONCLUSIONS: A societal value set for the EQ-5D-5L was developed that can be 
used for economic evaluations and decision making in US health systems. The 
internationally established, standardized protocol used to develop this US-based 
value set was recommended by the EuroQol Group and can facilitate cross-country 
comparisons.

Faster running is not performed with proportional increase in all joint 
torque/work exertions. Although previous studies have investigated lumbopelvic 
kinetics for a single velocity, it is unclear whether each lumbopelvic torque 
should increase for faster running. We examined the relationship between running 
velocity and lumbopelvic kinetics. We calculated the three-dimensional 
lumbosacral kinetics of 10 male sprinters during steady-state running on a 
temporary indoor running track at five target velocities: 3.0 (3.20 ± 0.16), 4.5 
(4.38 ± 0.18), 6.0 (5.69 ± 0.47), 7.5 (7.30 ± 0.41), and maximal sprinting 
(9.27 ± 0.36 m/s). The lumbosacral axial rotation torque increased more markedly 
(from 0.37 ± 0.06 to 1.99 ± 0.46 Nm/kg) than the extension and lateral flexion 
torques. The increase in the axial rotation torque was larger above 7.30 m/s. 
Conversely, the extension and lateral flexion torques plateaued when running 
velocity increased above 7.30 m/s. Similar results were observed for mechanical 
work. The results indicate that faster running required larger lumbosacral axial 
rotation torque. Conversely, the extension and lateral flexion torques were 
relatively invariant to running velocity above 7 m/s, implying that faster 
running below 7 m/s might increase the biomechanical loads causing excessive 
pelvic posterior tilt and excessive pelvic drop which has the potential to cause 
pain/injury related to lumbopelvic extensors and lateral flexors, whereas these 
biomechanical loads might not relate with running velocity above 7 m/s.

INTRODUCTION: Loneliness and social isolation have been identified as 
significant public health concerns, but improving relationships and increasing 
social participation may improve health outcomes and quality of life. The aim of 
the Project About Loneliness and Social networks (PALS) study is to assess the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a guided social network intervention 
within a community setting among individuals experiencing loneliness and 
isolation and to understand implementation of Generating Engagement in Network 
Involvement (Genie) in the context of different organisations.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The PALS trial will be a pragmatic, randomised controlled 
trial comparing participants receiving the Genie intervention to a wait-list 
control group. Eligible participants will be recruited from organisations 
working within a community setting: any adult identified as socially isolated or 
at-risk of loneliness and living in the community will be eligible. Genie will 
be delivered by trained facilitators recruited from community organisations. The 
primary outcome will be the difference in the SF-12 Mental Health composite 
scale score at 6-month follow-up between the intervention and control group 
using a mixed effects model (accounting for clustering within facilitators and 
organisation). Secondary outcomes will be loneliness, social isolation, 
well-being, physical health and engagement with new activities. The economic 
evaluation will use a cost-utility approach, and adopt a public sector 
perspective to include health-related resource use and costs incurred by other 
public services. Exploratory analysis will use a societal perspective, and 
explore broader measures of benefit (capability well-being). A qualitative 
process evaluation will explore organisational and environmental arrangements, 
as well as stakeholder and participant experiences of the study to understand 
the factors likely to influence future sustainability, implementation and 
scalability of using a social network intervention within this context.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received NHS ethical approval (REC 
reference: 18/SC/0245). The findings from PALS will be disseminated widely 
through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and workshops in collaboration 
with our community partners.

INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability globally 
and its costs exceed those of cancer and diabetes combined. Recent evidence 
suggests that individualised cognitive and movement rehabilitation combined with 
lifestyle advice (cognitive functional therapy (CFT)) may produce larger and 
more sustained effects than traditional approaches, and movement sensor 
biofeedback may enhance outcomes. Therefore, this three-arm randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare the clinical effectiveness and economic 
efficiency of individualised CFT delivered with or without movement sensor 
biofeedback, with usual care for patients with chronic, disabling LBP.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Pragmatic, three-arm, randomised, parallel group, 
superiority RCT comparing usual care (n=164) with CFT (n=164) and 
CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback (n=164). Inclusion criteria include: adults 
with a current episode of LBP >3 months; sought primary care ≥6 weeks ago for 
this episode of LBP; average LBP intensity of ≥4 (0-10 scale); at least moderate 
pain-related interference with work or daily activities. The CFT-only and 
CFT-plus-movement-sensor-biofeedback participants will receive seven treatment 
sessions over 12 weeks plus a 'booster' session at 26 weeks. All participants 
will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 13, 26, 40 and 52 weeks. The primary outcome 
is pain-related physical activity limitation (Roland Morris Disability 
Questionnaire). Linear mixed models will be used to assess the effect of 
treatment on physical activity limitation across all time points, with the 
primary comparison being a formal test of adjusted mean differences between 
groups at 13 weeks. For the economic (cost-utility) analysis, the primary 
outcome of clinical effect will be quality-adjusted life years measured across 
the 12-month follow-up using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L .
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approved by Curtin University Human Research Ethics 
Committee (HRE2018-0062, 6 Feb 2018). Study findings will be disseminated 
through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from 
deficient activity of α-galactosidase A, leading to the accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids such as globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3). The 
gastrointestinal symptoms of this disease may be disabling, and the life 
expectancy of affected patients is shortened by kidney and heart disease. Our 
hypothesis was that lyso-Gb3 may modify the gut microbiota. The impact of 
a clinically relevant concentration of lyso-Gb3 on mono- or multispecies 
bacterial biofilms were evaluated. A complex bacterial community from the 
simulated transverse colon microbiota was studied using quantitative PCR to 
estimate different bacterial group concentrations and a HPLC was used to 
estimate short-chain fatty acids concentrations. We found that lyso-Gb3 
increased the biofilm-forming capacity of several individual bacteria, including 
Bacteroides fragilis and significantly increased the growth of B. fragilis in a 
multispecies biofilm. Lyso-Gb3 also modified the bacterial composition of the 
human colon microbiota suspension, increasing bacterial counts of B. fragilis, 
among others. Finally, lyso-Gb3 modified the formation of short-chain fatty 
acids, leading to a striking decrease in butyrate concentration. Lyso-Gb3 
modifies the biology of gut bacteria, favoring the production of biofilms and 
altering the composition and short-chain fatty-acid profile of the gut 
microbiota.

Osteosarcoma arises most frequently in the metaphysis around the knee and its 
management by limb salvage surgery in skeletally immature pediatric patients is 
extremely challenging. Common reconstructive methods such as endoprosthetic or 
biological reconstruction are not fully capable of dealing with 
durability-related and growth-related problems and their functional outcomes are
