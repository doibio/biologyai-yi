Objectives Thalassemia is the most common genetic disorder in Egypt, with an 
estimated carrier rate of 9-10%. It is a genetic blood disorder which can be 
fatal if proper chelation is not received. The introduction of chelating agents 
capable of removing excessive iron from the body has dramatically increased life 
expectancy and improved the overall quality of life. The aim of this study was 
to assess the impact of educational programmes regarding chelation therapy on 
the quality of life of thalassemic children. Methods The study was carried out 
at the Mansoura University Children's Hospital in the period between March 2010 
and May 2011. It included 173 B-thalassemia children (84 boys and 89 girls) with 
age ranging between 8-18 years. The researcher used a predesigned interviewing 
questionnaire to collect data regarding children's knowledge about thalassemia 
and its management, especially regarding chelation therapy. The paediatric 
quality-of-life inventory tool (Peds QL 4.0 generic core) was also used to 
assess the studied children's quality of life. Results There was a significant 
statistical difference of the studied children's knowledge regarding chelation 
therapy and their quality of life. Conclusion There was a positive effect of the 
educational programme in improving children's knowledge score and their quality 
of life. Application of educational programmes for thalassemic children and 
their nurses regarding chelation therapy and its importance in preventing 
thalassemia complications is established.

The epidemiological transition has provided the theoretical background for the 
expectation of convergence in mortality patterns. We formally test and reject 
the convergence hypothesis for a sample of industrialized countries in the 
period from 1960 to 2008. After a period of convergence in the decade of 1960 
there followed a sustained process of divergence with a pronounced increase at 
the end of the 1980's, explained by trends within former Socialist countries 
(Eastern countries). While Eastern countries experienced abrupt divergence after 
the dissolution of the Soviet Union, differences within Western countries 
remained broadly constant for the whole period. Western countries transitioned 
from a strong correlation between life expectancy and variance in 1960 to no 
association between both moments in 2008 while Eastern countries experienced the 
opposite evolution. Taken together, our results suggest that convergence can be 
better understood when accounting for shared structural similarities amongst 
groups of countries rather than through global convergence.

Lipodystrophy induced by combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS 
patients: a Belgrade cohort study.

Dragović G, Danilović D, Dimić A, Jevtović D.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to dramatic 
reductions in mortality and morbidity of HIV/AIDS-patients. Lipodystrophy, a 
syndrome including peripheral fat wasting and central obesity, is 
well-documented side effect of HAART. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
incidence of lipodystrophy, and to determine its risk ratios in a 
HIV/AIDS-cohort.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study included all the antiretroviral-naive 
HIV/AIDS patients commencing HAART from October 1, 2001 to October 1, 2010, at 
the HIV/AIDS Center, Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Belgrade, 
Serbia. Univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses were 
used to determine the odds ratios (OR) with the confidence interval (CI) of 95%, 
in order to establish the relative risk for lipodystrophy. The 
Kaplan-Meier-method was used to determine the probability of development 
lipodystrophy over time. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
software version using 0.05 as a p-treshold for the significance.
RESULTS: This study included 840 HIV/AIDS patients, 608 women and 232 men, 
followed for 5.6 +/- 2.8 years. The prevalence of lipodystrophy was 69.2%. 
Univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analysis identified that the 
female gender, hepatitis C coinfection, AIDS diagnosis prior to HAART 
initiation, nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors and protease-inhibitors 
based regimens had a high risk for developing lipodystrophy in HIV/AIDS-patients 
(OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-3.49, p = 0.04; OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 1.3-6.8, p < 0.01; 
OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.7-6.1, p < 0.01; OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.7-3.3, p < 0.01; OR = 
6.1, 95% CI = 4.1-9.7, p < 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Despite much greater life expectancy of HIV/AIDS-patients, 
treatment-related toxicities still remain a major concern. Monitoring of 
lipodystrophy, as side effect of HAART, is particularly important.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by 
widespread organ involvement. Given the scope of modern treatment, there has 
been a rise in life expectancy and quality with a mean estimated 5-year survival 
of 82%-90%. Hence, hospitalizations of SLE patients for non-SLE related causes 
have not been investigated. Our aim was to characterize the SLE patients 
admitted to the internal medicine wards, the main diagnosis at admission, and 
the course of hospitalization and to compare the outcome with the general 
population. We expected to find a significant difference between the SLE 
population and the general population regarding hospitalization parameters. 
However we found a good prognosis for hospitalized SLE patients with non-related 
disease compared to the non-SLE group. SLE was not a significant prognostic 
factor for outcome in patients hospitalized in the internal medicine ward for 
non-related causes. Men with SLE had a worse prognosis during hospitalization 
when compared to females. The SLEDAI score was not an appropriate prognostic 
method for the outcome of hospitalization.

To determine if differences in life history parameters contribute to native 
species exclusion, immature development times, larval survivorship, reproductive 
life history parameters, and age-specific life tables were determined for two 
populations (eastern United States and western United States) of ninespotted 
lady beetles (Coccinella novemnotata Herbst) and one population of sevenspotted 
lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L.). Developing larvae were provided an 
ad libitum diet of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) at a constant 
temperature of 25°C. The first and fourth larval stadia of C. novemnotata were 
significantly longer than that of C. septempunctata, as was their total 
development time from egg to newly eclosed adult. Stage-specific developmental 
mortality was low for both species and did not exceed 7% for the entire 
development period. The preoviposition period of the two C. novemnotata 
populations was significantly shorter (15-20%) than that of C. septempunctata. 
C. novemnotata from both locations laid significantly fewer total eggs than C. 
septempunctata (34-40% fewer) over the 31-d test period, and also fewer eggs per 
day (37-43% fewer). The net reproductive rate of the C. novemnotata populations 
was 42-50% lower than that of C. septempunctata as was C. novemnotata's 
intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm: 0.1716 and 0.1840 vs. 0.1959 for western 
and eastern C. novemnotata and C. septempunctata, respectively).

BACKGROUND: Vascular complications curtail life expectancy and quality of life 
in type 1 diabetes and development at younger ages is particularly detrimental. 
To date no review has summarised the prevalence or factors predicting their 
development in young adults.
METHODS: A quantitative epidemiological systematic review was conducted to 
identify the prevalence and predictive factors for development of retinopathy, 
nephropathy and hypertension in young adults (sample age mean [plus 1SD] 18-30 
years) with type 1 diabetes, using processes adapted from established review 
methods set out by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.MEDLINE (Ovid), 
Scopus (Elsevier), CINAHL, Science Direct (Elsevier), Google Scholar and 
Cochrane databases were searched to identify relevant articles published between 
1993 and June 2014. From this eleven papers were retrieved, appraised and 
results summarised by three reviewers using established methods.
RESULTS: Some form of retinopathy occurred in up to almost half of participants; 
more severe forms affected up to one in ten. One in six was reported with 
microalbuminuria; one in 14 had macroalbuminuria. Hypertension occurred in 
almost one in two participants. Applying out-dated high thresholds this 
decreased to approximately one in ten participants. Glycaemic control was a 
consistent predictor of vascular disease in this age group.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence rates of retinopathy, nephropathy and hypertension in 
young adults with type 1 diabetes emphasise the importance of regular 
complication screening for early detection and treatment. The predictive effect 
of glycaemic control reinforces its importance for prevention of vascular 
complications.

AIM: To investigate life expectancy and mortality among former elite athletes 
and controls.
METHODS: HR analysis of cause-specific deaths sourced from the national death 
registry for former Finnish male endurance, team and power sports athletes 
(N=2363) and controls (N=1657). The median follow-up time was 50 years.
RESULTS: Median life expectancy was higher in the endurance (79.1 years, 95% CI 
76.6 to 80.6) and team (78.8, 78.1 to 79.8) sports athletes than in controls 
(72.9, 71.8 to 74.3). Compared to controls, risk for total mortality adjusted 
for socioeconomic status and birth cohort was lower in the endurance ((HR 0.70, 
95% CI 0.61 to 0.79)) and team (0.80, 0.72 to 0.89) sports athletes, and 
slightly lower in the power sports athletes (0.93, 0.85 to 1.03). HR for 
ischaemic heart disease mortality was lower in the endurance (0.68, 0.54 to 
0.86) and team sports (0.73, 0.60 to 0.89) athletes. HR for stroke mortality was 
0.52 (0.33 to 0.83) in the endurance and 0.59 (0.40 to 0.88) in the team sports 
athletes. Compared to controls, the risk for smoking-related cancer mortality 
was lower in the endurance (HR 0.20, 0.08 to 0.47) and power sports (0.40, 0.25 
to 0.66) athletes. For dementia mortality, the power sports athletes, 
particularly boxers, had increased risk (HR 4.20, 2.30 to 7.81).
CONCLUSIONS: Elite athletes have 5-6 years additional life expectancy when 
compared to men who were healthy as young adults. Lower mortality for 
cardiovascular disease was in part due to lower rates of smoking, as 
tobacco-related cancer mortality was especially low.

Schizophrenia is a highly disabling disorder whose causes remain to be better 
understood, and treatments have to be improved. However, several recent advances 
have been made in diagnosis, etiopathology, and treatment. Whereas reliability 
of diagnosis has improved with operational criteria, including Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (DSM) Fifth Edition, validity of the 
disease boundaries remains unclear because of substantive overlaps with other 
psychotic disorders. Recent emphasis on dimensional approaches and translational 
bio-behavioral research domain criteria may eventually help move toward a 
neuroscience-based definition of schizophrenia. The etiology of schizophrenia is 
now thought to be multifactorial, with multiple small-effect and fewer 
large-effect susceptibility genes interacting with several environmental 
factors. These factors may lead to developmentally mediated alterations in 
neuroplasticity, manifesting in a cascade of neurotransmitter and circuit 
dysfunctions and impaired connectivity with an onset around early adolescence. 
Such etiopathological understanding has motivated a renewed search for novel 
pharmacological as well as psychotherapeutic targets. Addressing the core 
features of the illness, such as cognitive deficits and negative symptoms, and 
developing hypothesis-driven early interventions and preventive strategies are 
high-priority goals for the field. Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic mental 
disorder and is among the most disabling disorders in all of medicine. It is 
estimated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that 2.4 million 
people over the age of 18 in the US suffer from schizophrenia. This illness 
typically begins in adolescence and derails the formative goals of school, 
family, and work, leading to considerable suffering and disability and reduced 
life expectancy by about 20 years. Treatment outcomes are variable, and some 
people are successfully treated and reintegrated (i.e. go back to work). Despite 
the effort of many experts in the field, however, schizophrenia remains a 
chronic relapsing and remitting disorder associated with significant impairments 
in social and vocational functioning and a shortened lifespan. Comprehensive 
treatment entails a multi-modal approach, including psychopharmacology, 
psychosocial interventions, and assistance with housing and financial 
sustenance. Research to date suggests a network of genetic, neural, behavioral, 
and environmental factors to be responsible for its development and course. This 
article aims to summarize and explain recent advancements in research on 
schizophrenia, to suggest how these recent discoveries may lead to a better 
understanding and possible further development of effective therapies, and to 
highlight the paradigm shifts that have taken place in our understanding of the 
diagnosis, etiopathology, and treatment.

A key question for urologic practitioners is whether an apparently 
organ-confined prostate cancer (PCa) is actually aggressive or not. The dilemma 
is to specifically identify among all prostate tumors the very aggressive 
high-grade cancers that will become life-threatening by developing 
extra-prostatic invasion and metastatic potential and the indolent cancers that 
will never modify a patient's life expectancy. A choice must be made between 
several therapeutic options to achieve the optimal personalized management of 
the disease that causes as little harm as possible to patients. Reliable 
clinical, biological, or pathological markers that would enable distinctions to 
be made between aggressive and indolent PCas in routine practice at the time of 
initial diagnosis are still lacking. The molecular mechanisms that explain why a 
PCa is aggressive or not are also poorly understood. Among the potential markers 
and/or actors in PCa aggressiveness, Src and other members of the Src kinase 
family, are valuable candidates. Activation of Src-dependent intracellular 
pathways is frequently observed in PCa. Indeed, Src is at the cross-roads of 
several pathways [including androgen receptor (AR), TGFbeta, Bcl-2, Akt/PTEN or 
MAPK, and ERK …], and is now known to influence some of the cellular and 
tissular events that accompany tumor progression: cell proliferation, cell 
motility, invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resistance to 
apoptosis, angiogenesis, neuroendocrine differentiation, and metastatic spread. 
Recent work even suggests that Src could also play a part in PCa initiation in 
coordination with the AR. The aim of this review is to gather data that explore 
the links between the Src kinase family and PCa progression and aggressiveness.

INTRODUCTION: People with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) require insulin therapy to 
sustain life, and need optimal glycaemic control to prevent diabetic 
ketoacidosis and serious long-term complications. Insulin is generally 
administered using multiple daily injections but can also be delivered using an 
infusion pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion), a more costly option 
with benefits for some patients. The UK National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) recommend the use of pumps for patients with the greatest 
need, citing insufficient evidence to approve extension to a wider population. 
Far fewer UK adults use pumps than in comparable countries. Previous trials of 
pump therapy have been small and of short duration and failed to control for 
training in insulin adjustment. This paper describes the protocol for a large 
randomised controlled trial comparing pump therapy with multiple daily 
injections, where both groups are provided with high-quality structured 
education.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, parallel group, cluster randomised 
controlled trial among 280 adults with T1DM. All participants attended the 
week-long dose adjustment for normal eating (DAFNE) structured education course, 
and receive either multiple daily injections or pump therapy for 2 years. The 
trial incorporates a detailed mixed-methods psychosocial evaluation and 
cost-effectiveness analysis. The primary outcome will be the change in 
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 24 months in those participants whose 
baseline HbA1c is at or above 7.5% (58 mmol/mol). The key secondary outcome will 
be the proportion of participants reaching the NICE target of an HbA1c of 7.5% 
(58 mmol/mol) or less at 24 months.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee North West, Liverpool East and received Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) clinical trials authorisation. Each 
participating centre gave National Health Service R&D approval. We shall 
disseminate study findings to study participants and through peer reviewed 
publications and conference presentations, including lay user groups.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) compared to continued medical therapy for 
patients with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort-style Markov decision-tree economic evaluation.
METHODS: The economic perspective was the U.S. third-party payer with a 30-year 
time horizon. The two comparative treatment strategies were: 1) ESS, followed by 
appropriate postoperative medical therapy; and 2) continued medical therapy 
alone. Primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). Costs were discounted at a rate of 3.5% in the reference case. Multiple 
sensitivity analyses were performed, including differing time-horizons, 
discounting scenarios, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: The reference case demonstrated that the ESS strategy cost a total of 
$48,838.38 and produced a total of 20.50 QALYs. The medical therapy alone 
strategy cost a total of $28,948.98 and produced a total of 17.13 QALYs. The 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio for ESS versus medical therapy alone is 
$5,901.90 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve from the PSA 
demonstrated that there is a 74% certainty that the ESS strategy is the most 
cost-effective decision for any willingness to pay a threshold greater than 
$25,000. The time-horizon analysis suggests that ESS becomes the cost-effective 
intervention within the third year after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that employing an ESS treatment

Terminal heart failure: who should be transplanted and who should have 
mechanical circulatory support?

Kirklin JK(1).

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Permanent long-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is 
currently reserved for patients who are transplant ineligible. In light of 
improved outcomes with current continuous flow devices, increased interest has 
focused on the potential extension of MCS therapy to ambulatory advanced heart 
failure patients and as an alternative to cardiac transplantation.
RECENT FINDINGS: Average 1-year and 2-year survival with heart transplantation 
is about 85 and 80%, and with MCS therapy, it is 85 and 70% (with censoring at 
transplant). Specific subsets of destination therapy patients enjoy survival out 
to 2 years, which is comparable with transplant survival. Risk factor analyses 
identify similar risk profiles for each therapy. Life satisfaction after each is 
highly dependent on the frequency and severity of adverse events, which are 
quite different for these interventions. Patients with long expected waiting 
times will likely be the initial group for triage off the transplant wait list 
to MCS therapy.
SUMMARY: MCS has progressively improved and may become a reasonable alternative 
to transplantation for highly selected patients with long expected waiting time. 
More routine extension of MCS therapy to the transplant population awaits 
further reduction of major adverse events, miniaturized devices, and less 
invasive implant techniques.

Adrenal insufficiency: review of clinical outcomes with current glucocorticoid 
replacement therapy.

Glucocorticoid replacement therapy in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI), 
whether primary (Addison's disease) or secondary (due to hypopituitarism), has 
been established for some 50 years. The current standard treatment regimen 
involves twice- or thrice-daily dosing with a glucocorticoid, most commonly oral 
hydrocortisone. Based on previous small-scale studies and clinical perception, 
life expectancy with conventional glucocorticoid replacement therapy has been 
considered normal, with a low incidence of adverse events. Data from the past 
10-15 years, however, have shown that morbidity remains high and life expectancy 
is reduced. The increased morbidity and decreased life expectancy appear to be 
due to both increased exposure to cortisol and insufficient cortisol coverage 
during infections and other stress-related events. This is thought to reflect a 
failure of treatment to replicate the natural circadian rhythm of cortisol 
release, together with a failure to identify and deliver individualized cortisol 
exposure and to manage patients adequately when increased doses are required. 
The resulting over- or under-treatment may result in Cushing-like symptoms or 
adrenal crisis, respectively. This review summarizes the morbidity and mortality 
seen in patients receiving the current standard of care for AI and suggests 
areas for improvement in glucocorticoid replacement therapy.

Current challenges in the management of patients with relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma.

Miguel JF, Mateos MV.

When treating patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, clinicians 
should maximize the efficacy of treatment through use of the most appropriate 
combinations and sequences of agents. Treatment options depend on the duration 
and magnitude of response to previous therapies; the type and aggressiveness of 
the relapse; and patient factors such as comorbidities, performance 
status/quality of life, bone marrow reserve, renal function, previous toxicities 
(eg, peripheral neuropathy, venous thromboembolism), age, insurance coverage, 
distance from the hospital, and life expectancy. Patients who relapse within 1 
year of a stem-cell transplant (SCT) may require multidrug rescue therapy, 
followed by allogeneic SCT with reduced-intensity conditioning or 
consolidation/maintenance therapy. Those with a long duration of remission (3 to 
4 years) may undergo a second autologous SCT, using the original effective 
treatment protocol or a different combination as reinduction. Patients with 
intermediate remission duration (2 to 3 years) may benefit from the sequential 
use of novel agents as salvage therapy. In elderly patients, considerations of 
quality of life and cost constraints should be carefully weighed. At first 
relapse, the initial option would be to use a new scheme that is different from 
the one used for induction, unless the first remission was long enough to merit 
considering retreatment with the same scheme. At second or subsequent relapse, 
usually after having been treated with bortezomib (Velcade) and at least one 
immunomodulatory drug, enrollment in a clinical trial with experimental agents 
should be encouraged. This article describes the current evidence available for 
various treatment options as well as a personal approach to individualized 
therapy for relapsing patients.

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of establishing the Child Development Centre 
(CDC), Kerala for piloting comprehensive child adolescent development program in 
India, has been to understand the conceptualization, design and scaling up of a 
pro-active positive child development initiative, easily replicable all over 
India.
METHODS: The process of establishing the Child Development Centre (CDC) Kerala 
for research, clinical services, training and community extension services over 
the last 25 y, has been as follows; Step 1: Conceptualization--The life cycle 
approach to child development; Step 2: Research basis--CDC model early 
stimulation is effective; Step 3: Development and validation of seven simple 
developmental screening tools; Step 4: CDC Diagnostic services--Ultrasonology 
and genetic, and metabolic laboratory; Step 5: Developing seven intervention 
packages; Step 6: Training--Post graduate diploma in clinical child development; 
Step 7: CDC Clinic Services--seven major ones; Step 8: CDC Community 
Services--Child development referral units; Step 9: Community service delivery 
models--Childhood disability and for adolescent care counselling projects; Step 
10: National capacity building--Four child development related courses.
RESULTS: CDC Kerala follow-up and clinic services are offered till 18 y of age 
and premarital counselling till 24 y of age as shown in "CDC Kerala Clinic 
Services Flow Chart" and 74,291 children have availed CDC clinic services in the 
last 10 y.
CONCLUSIONS: CDC Kerala is the first model for comprehensive child adolescent 
development services using a lifecycle approach in the Government sector and 
hence declared as the collaborative centre for Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram 
(RBSK), in Kerala.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the availability of results from multiple newer 
clinical trials and changing healthcare costs, the cost-effectiveness of 
recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (r-tPA) for treatment of acute 
ischemic stroke within 0 to 3 hours of symptom onset was last evaluated in 1998 
for the United States Using current evidence, we evaluate the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of r-tPA administered 0 to 3 hours after acute ischemic 
stroke onset versus no r-tPA.
METHODS: A disease-based decision model to project lifetime outcomes of patients 
after acute ischemic stroke by r-tPA treatment status from the US payer 
perspective was developed. Model inputs were derived from a recent meta-analysis 
of r-tPA trials, cohort studies, and health state preference studies. Cost data, 
inflated to 2013 dollars, were based on drug wholesale acquisition cost and the 
literature. To compare r-tPA to no r-tPA, we calculated incremental total direct 
costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. We performed 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results.
RESULTS: r-tPA resulted in a gain of 0.39 quality-adjusted life years (95% 
confidence range, 0.16-0.66) on average per patient and a lifetime cost-saving 
of $25,000 (95% confidence range, -$42,500 to -$11,000) compared with no r-tPA. 
In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, r-tPA was dominant compared with no r-tPA 
in ≈100% of simulations. The model was sensitive to inputs for r-tPA efficacy, 
healthcare costs for disabled patients, mortality rates for disabled and 
nondisabled patients, and quality of life estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis supports earlier economic evaluations that r-tPA is a 
cost-effective method to treat stroke. Appropriate use of r-tPA should be 
prioritized nationally.

BACKGROUND: Breast-cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing in Japan. 
Japanese-specific clinical validity and utility data for the 21-gene assay 
(Oncotype DX® Breast Cancer Assay; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, USA) are 
now available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of the 21-gene assay for the guidance of adjuvant 
chemotherapy decisions in estrogen-receptor-positive, lymph-node-negative, 
early-stage breast cancer patients, from the Japanese societal perspective.
METHODS: The recurrence risk group distribution by the 21-gene assay result and 
the assay's influence on adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations were obtained 
from a study of 104 patients. A state-transition cohort (Markov) model tracked 
time from surgery until distant recurrence and from distant recurrence to death. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy benefit by 21-gene assay risk group was based on published 
clinical validation studies. Direct and indirect medical costs were obtained 
from the referral centers. Utilities associated with progression and 
chemotherapy-related adverse events were extracted from literature. Sensitivity 
analyses assessed the key drivers and robustness of the primary outcomes.
RESULTS: The 21-gene assay identified 48% of patients as low-risk, 36% as 
intermediate-risk, and 16% as high-risk. Total acute chemotherapy-related costs 
decreased by ¥154,066 due to less adjuvant chemotherapy usage. In the high-risk 
group, adjuvant chemotherapy use increased 18%, leading to survival benefits. 
Chemotherapy use overall decreased by 19%. Monitoring costs increased by ¥3,744 
but recurrence costs declined by ¥46,113 per patient. Use of the 21-gene assay 
increased quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) by 0.241 per patient on average; 
the net cost per QALY gained was ¥636,752 ($6,368).
CONCLUSIONS: The 21-gene assay for women with estrogen-receptor-positive, 
lymph-node-negative, early-stage breast cancer is projected to be cost-effective 
in Japan.

BACKGROUND: Keratinocyte cancer is the most common cancer among Caucasians.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to study time trends of the burden of disease attributable 
to keratinocyte cancer in The Netherlands.
METHODS: Data of all patients with newly diagnosed keratinocyte cancer (ie, 
squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) were obtained from the 
population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry and the Eindhoven Cancer Registry 
(1989-2008). Population structure, mortality data, and life expectancy data were 
extracted from Statistics Netherlands. The disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) 
was the sum of the years of life lived with disability and the years of life 
lost.
RESULTS: The world standardized rate of keratinocyte cancer has doubled and was 
103 and 94 per 100,000 person-years for males and females in 2004 to 2008, 
respectively. DALYs as a result of basal cell carcinoma increased by 124% and 
DALYs as a result of squamous cell carcinoma increased by 66% from 1989 to 1993. 
Keratinocyte cancer accounted for a total loss of 19,913 DALYs (15,369 years of 
life lived with disability and 4544 years of life lost) between 2004 and 2008.
LIMITATIONS: Only the first keratinocyte cancer was included in this study.
CONCLUSION: Keratinocyte cancer is a large burden to the Dutch society. Because 
incidence rates of keratinocyte cancer continue to increase, the management 
becomes even more challenging.

INTRODUCTION: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as metabolic, 
cardiovascular, cancers, injuries and mental health disorders are increasingly 
contributing to the disease burden in South Asia, in light of demographic and 
epidemiologic transitions in the region. Home to one-quarter of the world's 
population, the region is also an important priority area for meeting global 
health targets. In this review, we describe the current burden of and trends in 
four common NCDs (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease) in South Asia.
SOURCES OF DATA: The 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study supplemented with the 
peer-reviewed literature and reports by international agencies and national 
governments.
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The burden of NCDs in South Asia is rising at a rate that 
exceeds global increases in these conditions. Shifts in leading risk 
factors-particularly dietary habits, tobacco use and high blood pressure-are 
thought to underlie the mounting burden of death and disability due to NCDs. 
Improvements in life expectancy, increasing socioeconomic development and 
urbanization in South Asia are expected to lead to further escalation of NCDs.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Although NCD burdens are currently largest among affluent 
groups in South Asia, many adverse risk factors are concentrated among the poor, 
portending a future increase in disease burden among lower income individuals.
GROWING POINTS: There continues to be a notable lack of national surveillance 
data to document the distribution and trends in NCDs in the region. Similarly, 
economic studies and policy initiatives addressing NCD burdens are still in 
their infancy.
AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Opportunities for innovative structural 
and behavioral interventions that promote maintenance of healthy lifestyles-such 
as moderate caloric intake, adequate physical activity and avoidance of 
tobacco-in the context of socioeconomic development are abundant. Testing of 
health care infrastructure and systems that best provide low-cost and effective 
detection and treatment of NCDs is a priority for policy researchers.

Research Institute, Karnal, 132001 Haryana India.

Direct acidified cottage cheese has a limited shelf life of 10-12 days under 
refrigeration due to high moisture content (~75 %) and a relatively high pH 
(~5.0). This affects its widespread marketing and distribution. Hence, a study 
was undertaken to improve the shelf life of direct acidified cottage cheese 
using thymol, a phytophenolic natural antimicrobial agent. The effect of three 
different levels, i.e. 30, 40 and 50 ppm of 30 % thymol solution in butteroil on 
the physico-chemical, microbiological and organoleptic properties was studied at 
four-day interval during storage under refrigeration (4-5 °C). Promising results 
were obtained using 40 ppm thymol for inhibiting psychrotrophs, yeasts and molds 
as well as retarded the proteolysis in cottage cheese. Based on the effect on 
flavour of the fresh samples as well as the extent of changes in quality during 
storage, it was observed that addition of 40 ppm thymol enhanced the keeping 
quality of cottage cheese by 8 days compared to the control sample.

Temperature-dependent fecundity and survival data was integrated into a matrix 
population model to describe relative Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: 
Drosophilidae) population increase and age structure based on environmental 
conditions. This novel modification of the classic Leslie matrix population 
model is presented as a way to examine how insect populations interact with the 
environment, and has application as a predictor of population density. For D. 
suzukii, we examined model implications for pest pressure on crops. As case 
studies, we examined model predictions in three small fruit production regions 
in the United States (US) and one in Italy. These production regions have 
distinctly different climates. In general, patterns of adult D. suzukii trap 
activity broadly mimicked seasonal population levels predicted by the model 
using only temperature data. Age structure of estimated populations suggest that 
trap and fruit infestation data are of limited value and are insufficient for 
model validation. Thus, we suggest alternative experiments for validation. The 
model is advantageous in that it provides stage-specific population estimation, 
which can potentially guide management strategies and provide unique 
opportunities to simulate stage-specific management effects such as insecticide 
applications or the effect of biological control on a specific life-stage. The 
two factors that drive initiation of the model are suitable temperatures 
(biofix) and availability of a suitable host medium (fruit). Although there are 
many factors affecting population dynamics of D. suzukii in the field, 
temperature-dependent survival and reproduction are believed to be the main 
drivers for D. suzukii populations.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a 
weight management programme including elements of physical exercise and dietary 
restriction which are designed to help women lose excess weight gained during 
pregnancy in the vulnerable postnatal period and inhibit the development of 
behaviours which could lead to future excess weight gain and obesity.
STUDY DESIGN: A mathematical model based on a regression equation predicting 
change in weight over a fifteen year postnatal period was developed.
METHODS: The model included programme effectiveness and resource data based on a 
randomized controlled trial of a weight management programme implemented in a 
postnatal population in the United States. Utility and mortality data based on 
body mass index categories were also included. The model adopted a National 
Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS) perspective, a lifetime 
time horizon and estimated the cost effectiveness of a weight management 
programme against a no change comparator in terms of an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: The baseline results show that the difference in weight between women 
who received the weight management programme and women who received the control 
intervention was 3.02 kg at six months and 3.53 kg at fifteen years following 
childbirth. This results in an ICER of £7355 per quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) for women who were married at childbirth.
CONCLUSION: The estimated ICER would suggest that such a weight management 
programme is cost-effective at a NICE threshold of £20,000 per QALY. However 
significant structural and evidence based uncertainty is present in the 
analysis.
