health throughout life and during aging. In the last decade, studies on p66(Shc) 
knock-out mice have indicated that this gene is a crucial regulator of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) levels and is involved in age-related dysfunctions. 
p66(Shc-/-) mice show indeed a healthy phenotype characterized by greater brain 
and behavioral plasticity - associated to increased central levels of the 
neurotrophin Bran-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) - in addition to reduced 
oxidative stress, fat accumulation and incidence of metabolic and cardiovascular 
pathologies. Studies performed in a semi-naturalistic setting, involving 
exposure to low temperatures and food shortage indicate that p66(Shc) has been 
conserved through evolution because of its role as "thrifty gene" in energy 
metabolism. This feature, which allows survival in harsh natural conditions, can 
be deleterious when food is constantly available, as in westernized lifestyles, 
leading to fat accumulation and predisposing to metabolic, cardiovascular 
diseases and accelerating brain aging. Being at the crossroad of signaling 
pathways involved in both central and peripheral stress responses and in the 
regulation of energy homeostasis, p66(Shc) is a good candidate molecule to 
address the mechanisms underlying healthy aging and to be targeted for the 
development of novel pharmacological tools for the prevention or cure of 
age-related pathologies.

Ceratitis capitata.

Injuries frequently accumulate with age in nature. Despite the commonality of 
injury and the resulting impairment, there are limited experimental data for the 
effects of impairment on life history trade-offs between reproduction and 
survival in insects. We tested the effects of artificial injury and the 
resulting impairment on the reproductive costs and behavior of male medflies, 
Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Treatment flies were 
impaired by amputating tarsomere segments 2-5 from the right foreleg at either 
eclosion or age 22 days. The effect of impairment and age on the cost of 
reproduction was tested by varying the timing of female availability among the 
treatments. Courtship behavior and copulation rates were observed hourly from 
age 2-5 days to determine the effects of impairment on reproductive behavior. 
Female access combined with the impairment reduced the life expectancy of males 
more than the impairment alone, whereas the health effect of amputation was 
influenced by age. Conversely, the risk of death due to impairment was not 
influenced by the males' mating status prior to amputation. The males' 
copulation success was reduced due to impairment, whereas courtship behavior was 
not affected. Impairment does not reduce the males' impulse to mate but 
decreases the females' receptivity to copulation, while also increasing the cost 
of each successful mating. Overall, minor impairment lowers the reproductive 
success of males and reduces longevity.

BACKGROUND: Whether muscle strength in youth is related to cardiovascular risk 
later in life independent of cardiorespiratory fitness is unclear.
METHODS: We examined the independent association of isometric muscle strength in 
youth with cardiovascular risk factors in young adulthood using data from the 
Danish European Youth Heart Study; a population-based prospective cohort study 
among boys and girls (n=332) followed for up to 12 years. In youth maximal 
voluntary contractions during isometric back extension and abdominal flexion 
were determined using a strain-gauge dynamometer and cardiorespiratory fitness 
was obtained from a maximal cycle ergometer test. Cardiovascular risk factors 
were obtained in youth and in young adulthood. Associations were examined using 
multivariable-adjusted regression models including major confounding factors.
RESULTS: Each 1 SD difference in isometric muscle strength in youth (0.17 N/kg) 
was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI; -0.60 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.97 
to -0.22), triglyceride (-0.09 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.02), diastolic blood 
pressure (BP) (-1.22 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.15 to -0.29) and a composite 
cardiovascular risk factor score (-0.61 SD, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.20) in young 
adulthood in multivariable-adjusted analyses including fitness. Associations to 
triglyceride, diastolic BP and the cardiovascular risk factor score remained 
with additional adjustment for waist circumference or BMI. Each 1 SD difference 
in isometric muscle strength in youth was significantly associated with 0.59 
(95% CI 0.40 to 0.87) lower odds of general overweight/obesity in young 
adulthood (p=0.007) and was marginally associated with incident raised BP, 
raised triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that greater isometric muscle strength in youth 
is associated with lower levels of cardiovascular risk factors in young 
adulthood independent of fitness, adiposity and other confounding factors.

Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,

OBJECTIVES: We set out to identify the contribution of various causes of death 
to regional differences in life expectancy in Ukraine.
METHODS: Mortality data by oblast (province) were obtained from the State 
Statistical Committee of Ukraine. The contribution of various causes of death to 
differences in life expectancy between East, West and South Ukraine was 
estimated using decomposition.
RESULTS: In 2008, life expectancy for men in South (61.8 years) and East Ukraine 
(61.2 years) was lower than for men in West Ukraine (64.0 years). A similar 
pattern was observed among women. This was mostly due to deaths from infectious 
disease and external causes among young adults, and cardio- and cerebro-vascular 
deaths among older adults. Deaths from TB among young adults contribute most to 
differences in life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Deaths due to infectious disease, especially TB, play an important 
role in the gap in life expectancy between regions in Ukraine. These deaths are 
entirely preventable--further research is needed to identify what has 
'protected' individuals in Western Ukraine from the burden of deaths experienced 
by their Southern and Eastern counterparts.

(JB, AT)

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The generic preference-based measures (GPBMs) of 
health have been widely used to obtain health utility scores for calculating 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for economic evaluations. It has been 
recognized that GPBMs may miss relevant or important dimensions of health for 
some specific medical conditions. The objective of this study is to explore the 
effect of extending the current EQ-5D descriptive system by adding a sleep 
dimension.
METHODS: A new instrument, EQ-5D+Sleep, is proposed by adding a sleep dimension 
to the EQ-5D. Based on an orthogonal design, 18 EQ-5D+Sleep states and EQ-5D 
states were selected and a valuation study was undertaken whereby 160 members of 
the generic public in South Yorkshire, UK, were interviewed using time tradeoff 
(TTO). Econometric models have been fitted to the data. Two null hypotheses were 
tested: 1) the coefficient for the sleep dimension is not significant; and 2) 
the inclusion of the sleep dimension has no impact on the way people value the 
original dimensions of EQ-5D.
RESULTS: and
CONCLUSIONS: The results support these two null hypotheses. There seems to be no 
benefit to adding a sleep dimension to the EQ-5D. Research is required to 
explore the method of adding dimensions to existing descriptive systems of 
health.

obesity.

Washington, 1959 NE Pacific Ave, H375Q, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.

OBJECTIVE: One-third of Americans are obese and an increasing number opt for 
bariatric surgery. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of common 
bariatric surgical procedures from a healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: We evaluated the three most common bariatric surgical procedures in the 
US: laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB), conventional (open) Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass (ORYGB), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) compared to 
no surgery. The reference case was defined as a 53-year old female with body 
mass index (BMI) of 44 kg/m(2). We developed a two-part model using a 
deterministic approach for the first 5-year period post-surgery and separate 
empirical forecasts for the natural history of BMI, costs and outcomes in the 
remaining years. We used a combination of datasets including Medicare and 
MarketScan(®) together with estimates from the literature to populate the model.
RESULTS: Bariatric surgery produced additional life expectancy (80-81 years) 
compared to no surgery (78 years). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) of the surgical procedures were US $6,600 per quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALY) gained for LRYGB, US $6,200 for LAGB, and US $17,300 for ORYGB 
(3 % discount rate for cost and QALYs). ICERs varied according to choice of BMI 
forecasting method and clinically plausible variation in parameter estimates. In 
most scenarios, the ICER did not exceed a threshold of US $50,000 per QALY 
gained.

BACKGROUND: Refractory asthma represents an important condition, with 
considerable morbidity and mortality. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a 
potential target for treatment of severe asthma. However, controlled studies 
have shown controversial results and the risk-benefit profile of TNF-blocking 
agents is still debated.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the effect of infliximab on asthma control in patients 
with severe, uncontrolled, steroid-dependent asthma.
METHODS: From 2007 to 2010, 7 patients received infliximab in our center. All 
had severe refractory asthma, with frequent severe exacerbations and 
hospitalizations in the intensive care unit despite maximal inhaled treatment, 
daily oral steroids and omalizumab treatment.
RESULTS: Asthma control improved in the 6 patients who received infliximab for 
at least 3 months. Oral steroids could be stopped in 4 and the frequency of 
exacerbations and hospitalizations was greatly reduced, especially for the 3 
patients with brittle asthma. Two patients showed severe adverse effects 
(bacterial pneumonia and extension of spreading melanoma). Three patients have 
received infliximab for more than 2 years, with good tolerance.
CONCLUSION: This case series suggests that anti-TNF-α drugs may improve the 
condition of a subgroup of patients with severe steroid-refractory asthma, with 
a favourable risk-benefit profile for most, considering asthma severity, 
occurrence of life-threatening exacerbations and complications of long-term oral 
steroids. Specific controlled trials of this subgroup are warranted.

Po, N.T., Hong Kong. takcheng@ied.edu.hk

With a noninterventionist government and an ideology emphasizing family 
self-reliance, yet one of the oldest populations around the world, Hong Kong 
faces many unresolved policy issues in aging, including public financial 
support, long-term care, and the lack of health or mental health care policies 
for older people. Despite funding limitations, research is vibrant and 
population aging is drawing more researchers into the field. Following a review 
of some of the major research activities, we conclude with some observations on 
a few key issues for the field of gerontology to move forward with in Hong Kong.

Hospital, †Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and

Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.

BACKGROUND: Debilitating lower extremity lymphedema can be either congenital or 
acquired. Utility scores are an objective measure used in medicine to quantify 
degrees of impact on an individual's life. Using standardized utility outcome 
measures, we aimed to quantify the health state of living with severe unilateral 
lower extremity lymphedema.
METHODS: A utility outcomes assessment using visual analog scale, time 
trade-off, and standard gamble was used for lower extremity lymphedema, 
monocular blindness, and binocular blindness from a sample of the general 
population and medical students. Average utility scores were compared using a 
paired t test. Linear regression was performed using age, race, and education as 
independent predictors.
RESULTS: A total of 144 prospective participants were included. All measures 
[visual analog scale, time trade-off, and standard gamble; expressed as mean 
(SD)] for unilateral lower extremity lymphedema (0.50 ± 0.18, 0.76 ± 0.22, and 
0.76 ± 0.21, respectively) were significantly different (P < 0.001) from the 
corresponding scores for monocular blindness (0.64 ± 0.18, 0.84 ± 0.16, and 0.83 
± 0.17, respectively) and binocular blindness (0.35 ± 0.17, 0.61 ± 0.28, and 
0.62 ± 0.26, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that a sample of the general population and medical 
students, if faced with severe lymphedema, is willing to theoretically trade 
8.64 life-years and undergo a procedure with a 24% risk of mortality to restore 
limb appearance and function to normal. These findings provide a frame of 
reference regarding the meaning of a diagnosis of severe lower extremity 
lymphedema to a patient and will allow objective comparison with other health 
states.

Routine on-site evaluation of specimen adequacy during initial ultrasound-guided 
fine needle aspiration of thyroid nodules: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Chicago, IL, USA.

BACKGROUND: On-site evaluation (OSE) of specimen adequacy during fine needle 
aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules reduces unsatisfactory results but adds 
cost. We hypothesized that the addition of routine OSE to initial 
ultrasound-guided FNA of thyroid nodules is not cost-effective.
METHODS: Formal cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a decision model 
to compare strategies of routine initial OSE versus restriction of OSE to cases 
of prior inadequate FNA. Adequacy rates for FNA without OSE and detriment to 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for undergoing repeat FNA were estimated 
on the basis of literature review and institutional experience. Costs were 
estimated using Medicare limiting charges and Bureau of Labor Statistics wage 
rates. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine the uncertainty of the model 
variable estimates.
RESULTS: The routine OSE strategy produced a gain of 0.00007 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) at an additional cost of $43.75 for an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $639,143/QALY when compared to restriction of OSE to 
cases with prior inadequate results. During sensitivity analysis, routine OSE 
became cost-effective if FNA adequacy rate without OSE decreased from 90 to 
85 %, cost of OSE decreased from $116 to $75, cost of FNA increased from $366 to 
$735, hourly wage increased from $23 to $123, or QALE detriment for repeat FNA 
increased from 0.25 to 1.6 days.
CONCLUSIONS: OSE for initial ultrasound-guided FNA of thyroid nodules is not 
cost-effective unless the adequacy rate without OSE is less than 85 %. When 
operator performance exceeds this rate, OSE should be reserved for cases with 
previous inadequate results.

BACKGROUND: The advent and approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have 
dramatically improved the life expectancy of patients with chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML), which has been transformed into a chronically manageable 
disease.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to qualitatively assess the effects of diagnosis 
and treatment on patients with CML to offer recommendations for health-care 
providers (HCPs) for the better support of patients.
METHODS: By use of an ethnographic approach based on in-home interviews, photo 
journals, and an optional telephone debriefing interview, this study included 50 
patients with CML from Brazil, France, Germany, Russia, and Spain, including 
patients within 18 months of diagnosis and receiving frontline TKI therapy 
(n = 20), patients between >18 months and 7 years from diagnosis and receiving 
ongoing frontline therapy (n = 20), and patients who switched to second- or 
third-line TKI therapy (n = 10). In-home interviews were designed to address 
patient perceptions and experiences regarding such issues as adherence, disease 
knowledge, disease management, and relationships with HCPs. Transcripts from 
these interviews and other data were analyzed to identify similar patterns and 
themes experienced by patients with CML.
RESULTS: The investigation generated a five-stage, patient-centered model of the 
experience of the patient throughout diagnosis, treatment, and management of 
CML: crisis, hope, adaptation, new normal, and uncertainty. Patients proceeded 
through these stages in the course of their disease management. The stages were 
affected by the patients' emotional and social experiences, their knowledge 
about CML, their positive experiences with their HCPs and/or treatment, and 
their optimism about their long-term prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified five common stages experienced by patients with CML 
and suggest several recommendations for HCPs on the management of patients 
through their disease journey. By providing support, education, and reassurance, 
HCPs can help patients as they move through the early stages of crisis and hope. 
When patients are in the adaptation and new-normal stages, HCPs can help 
patients achieve and maintain a new normality by setting expectations for the 
risks/benefits of long-term chronic drug therapy and disease monitoring and by 
continuing to support patient adherence.

Effect of repeat Kasai hepatic portoenterostomy on pediatric live-donor liver 
graft for biliary atresia.

OBJECTIVES: Treatment for patients with biliary atresia is a Kasai hepatic 
portoenterostomy; however, the efficacy of repeat Kasai hepatic portoenterostomy 
is unclear. This study sought to examine the effect of a prior Kasai hepatic 
portoenterostomy, especially a repeat Kasai hepatic portoenterostomy, on the 
outcomes of living-donor liver transplant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-six of 170 children that underwent a 
living-donor liver transplant between May 2001, and March 2010, received a 
living-donor liver transplant for biliary atresia. These patients were divided 
into 2 groups according to the number of previous portoenterostomies: 1 (group 
A, n=100) or 2 or more Kasai hepatic portoenterostomies (group B, n=26). 
Portoenterostomy was performed twice in 24 patients in group B, 3 times in 1, 
and 4 times in 1. Preoperative, operative factors, mortality, morbidity, and 
survival rates were examined and compared between groups.
RESULTS: The surgical factors such as operative time, blood loss per weight, 
cold ischemia time, and weight of the native liver were significantly greater in 
group B than they were in group A. The patient survival rates were comparable in 
the 2 groups (94.5% in group A and 93.3% in group B), and the difference was not 
statistically significant. No statistically significant difference was observed 
between the groups with regard to vascular complications, biliary complications, 
and other factors including postoperative variables. Bowel perforation requiring 
surgical repair was more frequent in group B than it was in group A.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeat Kasai hepatic portoenterostomy might have a negative effect 
on patients who undergo living-donor liver transplant for biliary atresia 
patients with potential lethal complications such as bowel perforation. More 
biliary atresia patients could have a liver transplant, with improved survival 
and better life expectancy, if they have inadequate biliary drainage after the 
initial Kasai hepatic portoenterostomy.

Nature appropriation and associations with population health in Canada's largest 
cities.

Earth is a finite system with a limited supply of resources. As the human 
population grows, so does the appropriation of Earth's natural capital, thereby 
exacerbating environmental concerns such as biodiversity loss, increased 
pollution, deforestation and global warming. Such concerns will negatively 
impact human health although it is widely believed that improving socio-economic 
circumstances will help to ameliorate environmental impacts and improve health 
outcomes. However, this belief does not explicitly acknowledge the fact that 
improvements in socio-economic position are reliant on increased inputs from 
nature. Gains in population health, particularly through economic means, are 
disconnected from the appropriation of nature to create wealth so that health 
gains become unsustainable. The current study investigated the sustainability of 
human population health in Canada with regard to resource consumption or 
"ecological footprints" (i.e., the resources required to sustain a given 
population). Ecological footprints of the 20 largest Canadian cities, along with 
several important determinants of health such as income and education, were 
statistically compared with corresponding indicators of human population health 
outcomes. A significant positive relationship was found between ecological 
footprints and life expectancy, as well as a significant negative relationship 
between ecological footprints and the prevalence of high blood pressure. Results 
suggest that increased appropriation of nature is linked to improved health 
outcomes. To prevent environmental degradation from excessive appropriation of 
natural resources will require the development of health promotion strategies 
that are de-coupled from ever-increasing and unsustainable resource use. Efforts 
to promote population health should focus on health benefits achieved from a 
lifestyle based on significantly reduced consumption of natural resources.

BACKGROUND: For many, physical activity has been engineered out of daily life, 
leading to high levels of sedentariness and obesity. Multi-faceted physical 
activity interventions, combining individual, community and environmental 
approaches, have the greatest potential to improve public health, but few have 
been evaluated.
METHODS: Approximately 100,000 people may benefit from improved opportunities 
for physical activity through an urban regeneration project in Northern Ireland, 
the Connswater Community Greenway. Using the macro-simulation PREVENT model, we 
estimated its potential health impacts and cost-effectiveness. To do so, we 
modelled its potential impact on the burden from cardiovascular disease, namely, 
ischaemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and stroke, and colon and 
breast cancer, by the year 2050, if feasible increases in physical activity were 
to be achieved.
RESULTS: If 10% of those classified as 'inactive' (perform less than 150 minutes 
of moderate activity/week) became 'active', 886 incident cases (1.2%) and 75 
deaths (0.9%) could be prevented with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
£4469/disability-adjusted life year. For effectiveness estimates as low as 2%, 
the intervention would remain cost-effective (£18 411/disability-adjusted life 
year). Small gains in average life expectancy and disability-adjusted life 
expectancy could be achieved, and the Greenway population would benefit from 46 
less years lived with disability.
CONCLUSION: The Greenway intervention could be cost-effective at improving 
physical activity levels. Although the direct health gains are predicted to be 
small for any individual, summed over an entire population, they are 
substantial. In addition, the Greenway is likely to have much wider benefits 
beyond health.

BACKGROUND: Nearly one of every three workers in the United States is 
low-income. Low-income populations have a lower life expectancy and greater 
rates of chronic diseases compared to those with higher incomes. Low- income 
workers face hazards in their workplaces as well as in their communities. 
Developing integrated public health programs that address these combined health 
hazards, especially the interaction of occupational and non-occupational risk 
factors, can promote greater health equity.
METHODS: We apply a social-ecological perspective in considering ways to improve 
the health of the low-income working population through integrated health 
protection and health promotion programs initiated in four different settings: 
the worksite, state and local health departments, community health centers, and 
community-based organizations.
RESULTS: Examples of successful approaches to developing integrated programs are 
presented in each of these settings. These examples illustrate several 
complementary venues for public health programs that consider the complex 
interplay between work-related and non work-related factors, that integrate 
health protection with health promotion and that are delivered at multiple 
levels to improve health for low-income workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether at the workplace or in the community, employers, workers, 
labor and community advocates, in partnership with public health practitioners, 
can deliver comprehensive and integrated health protection and health promotion 
programs. Recommendations for improved research, training, and coordination 
among health departments, health practitioners, worksites and community 
organizations are proposed.

BACKGROUND: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is aimed at modifying the immune 
response to a causative allergen, thereby reducing clinical symptoms and 
symptomatic medication intake and improving quality of life. Long-term AIT 
research has led to the development of 5-grass pollen tablets, currently 
indicated for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis (AR).
METHODS: A post-hoc analysis was conducted using the Average Adjusted Symptom 
Score (AAdSS) to compare the effect of treatment of AR with 5-grass pollen 
tablets versus placebo treatment. Using the results of the VO34.04 and VO53.06 
trials and economic data, cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-grass pollen tablet 
treatment was performed from the Italian third-party payer perspective with cost 
data derived from a study of 2008 updated to 2011. Also a societal perspective 
was considered by using the costs related to the losses of productivity by 
following the human capital approach. Using the results of the analysis, the 
estimated receiver-operating characteristic curve was plotted to evaluate 
medication effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a 
decision tree constructed to model the possible outcomes and costs for adults 
and paediatric patients with a low, medium, and high AAdSS. Finally, 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the 
results as well as their consistency at an assumed cost-effectiveness threshold 
of € 30,000/QALY.
RESULTS: The results indicate that compared to the placebo, the 5-grass pollen 
tablet treatment provides a benefit of 0.127 QALYs in medium AAdSS patients and 
of 0.143 QALYs in high AAdSS patients. The 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was 
found to cost € 1,024/QALY for patients with a medium AAdSS and € 1,035/QALY for 
patients with a high AAdSS. Of all the simulations performed in the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99 % indicated that the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was below the 
threshold of € 30,000/QALY in patients with medium and high AAdSS, whereas it 
was found to be dominated in 67 % of simulations related to patients with low 
AAdSS.
CONCLUSION: The 5-grass pollen tablet is a cost-effective treatment for adult AR 
patients with a medium or high AAdSS. This finding should be carefully 
considered when deciding the management strategy for these patients.

Lifetime costs and outcomes of repair of Tetralogy of Fallot compared to natural 
progression of the disease: Great Ormond Street Hospital cohort.

BACKGROUND: Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart disease that requires 
surgical repair without which survival through childhood is extremely rare. The 
aim of this paper is to use data from the mandatory follow-up of patients with 
Tetralogy of Fallot to model the health-related costs and outcomes over the 
first 55-years of life.
METHOD: A decision analytical model was developed to establish costs and 
outcomes for patients up to 55 years after diagnosis and first repair of 
Tetralogy of Fallot compared to natural progression. Data from Adult Congenital 
Heart Disease (ACHD) centres that follow up Tetralogy of Fallot patients and 
Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London, United Kingdom (UK) medical records 
was used to establish the cost and effectiveness of current interventions. Data 
from a Czech cohort was used for the natural, no intervention condition.
RESULTS: The average cost per patient of a repair for Tetralogy of Fallot was 
£26,938 (SE = £4,140). The full life time cost per patient, with no discount 
rate, was £65,310 (95% CI £64,981-£65,729); £56,559 discounted (95% CI 
£56,159-£56,960). Patients with a repair had an average of 35 Quality Adjusted 
Life Years (QALYs) per patient over 55 years undiscounted and 20.16 QALYs 
discounted. If the disorder was left to take its natural course, patients on 
average had a total of 3 QALYs per patient with no discount rate and 2.30 QALYs 
discounted.
CONCLUSION: A model has been developed that provides an estimate of the value 
for money of an expensive repair of a congenital heart disease. The model could 
be used to test the cost-effectiveness of making amendments to the care pathway.

Bordet, Bruxelles. dominique.lossignol@bordet.be

Continuous sedation is an acknowledged medical practice in the management of 
refractory symptoms at the end of life. Guidelines and recommendations have been 
proposed in palliative care. This paper presents the state-of-the-art 
(definitions, indications, technical aspects) on continuous sedation followed by 
an ethical reflection essentially based on the "double effect" principle, on the 
impact on life expectancy and the assimilation of continuous sedation as a 
"natural death". Distinction between continuous sedation and legal euthanasia is 
clarified.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer among Iranian 
women; however limited studies have been conducted to address survival rates.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine survival rates in Tabriz (Northwest of 
Iran) and compare with those of data reported from other cities and countries.
METHODS: Survival rates were calculated for one, three, five, seven and ten 
years for 271 breast cancer patients referred to one university clinic during 
1997-2008.
RESULTS: Survival analysis demonstrated a lower survival rate compared to 
western countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival rates for our patients are similar/better than other 
cities in Iran, but lower than certain European countries and the US. Further 
studies with a higher number of patients are now required.

The large and optically clear embryos of the zebrafish provide an excellent 
model system in which to study the dynamic assembly of the essential contractile 
band components, actin and myosin, via double fluorescent labelling in 
combination with confocal microscopy. We report the rapid appearance (i.e. 
within <2 min) of a restricted arc of F-actin patches along the prospective 
furrow plane in a central, apical region of the blastodisc cortex. These patches 
then fused with each other end-to-end forming multiple actin cables, which were 
subsequently bundled together forming an F-actin band. During this initial 
assembly phase, the F-actin-based structure did not elongate laterally, but was 
still restricted to an arc extending ~15° either side of the blastodisc apex. 
This initial assembly phase was then followed by an extension phase, where 
additional F-actin patches were added to each end of the original arc, thus 
extending it out to the edges of the blastodisc. The dynamics of phosphorylated 
myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) recruitment to this F-actin scaffold also reflect 
the two-phase nature of the contractile apparatus assembly. MLC2 was not 
associated with the initial F-actin arc, but MLC2 clusters were recruited and 
assembled into the extending ends of the band. We propose that the MLC2-free 
central region of the contractile apparatus acts to position and then extend the 
cleavage furrow in the correct plane, while the actomyosin ends alone generate 
the force required for furrow ingression. This biphasic assembly strategy may be 
required to successfully divide the early cells of large embryos.

AIM: The COSTABRAX study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nanoparticle 
albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) versus polyethylated castor oil-based 
standard paclitaxel (sb-paclitaxel) in the treatment of patients with previously 
treated metastatic breast cancer in Spain.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Efficacy data were obtained from the CA012 trial 
(nab-paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks [q3w] and sb-paclitaxel q3w) and 
indirect comparison (sb-paclitaxel administered weekly), and were modeled to a 
time horizon of 5 years using a Markov model. The analysis was performed from 
the National Health Service perspective. Use of resources and key assumptions of 
the model were validated by a panel of 22 local oncologists.
RESULTS: Compared with sb-paclitaxel q3w, nab-paclitaxel q3w was cost effective, 
with a cost per life year gained of €11,088 and a cost per quality-adjusted life 
year of €17,808. Compared with sb-paclitaxel administered weekly, it showed 
savings of €711 per patient.
CONCLUSION: The COSTABRAX study showed that nab-paclitaxel q3w is a 
cost-effective alternative compared with sb-paclitaxel q3w and a cost-saving 
alternative to sb-paclitaxel administered weekly in Spain.

Anesthesia and tau pathology.

States. Electronic address: raw9@columbia.edu.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and remains a 
growing worldwide health problem. As life expectancy continues to increase, the 
number of AD patients presenting for surgery and anesthesia will steadily rise. 
The etiology of sporadic AD is thought to be multifactorial, with environmental, 
biological and genetic factors interacting together to influence AD 
pathogenesis. Recent reports suggest that general anesthetics may be such a 
factor and may contribute to the development and exacerbation of this 
neurodegenerative disorder. Intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), 
composed of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau protein are one of the main 
neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Tau pathology is important in AD as it 
correlates very well with cognitive dysfunction. Lately, several studies have 
begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which anesthetic exposure might affect the 
phosphorylation, aggregation and function of this microtubule-associated 
protein. Here, we specifically review the literature detailing the impact of 
anesthetic administration on aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation as well as the 
subsequent development of neurofibrillary pathology and degeneration.

Blood transfusion for lower extremity bypass is associated with increased wound 
infection and graft thrombosis.

BACKGROUND: Packed RBC transfusion has been postulated to increase morbidity and 
mortality after cardiac/general surgical operations, but its effects after lower 
extremity bypass (LEB) have not been studied extensively.
STUDY DESIGN: Using the Vascular Study Group of New England's database 
(2003-2010), we examined 1,880 consecutive infrainguinal LEB performed for 
critical limb ischemia. Perioperative transfusion was categorized as 0 U, 1 to 2 
U, and ≥3 U. Cohort frequency group matching was used to compare groups of 
patients receiving 1 to 2 U and 0 U with patients receiving ≥3 U using age, 
coronary artery disease, diabetes, urgency, and indication of revascularization. 
Primary end points were perioperative mortality, wound infection, and loss of 
primary graft patency at discharge, as well as 1-year mortality and loss of 
primary graft patency.
RESULTS: In the study cohort, 1,532 LEBs (81.5%) received 0 U, 248 LEBs (13.2%) 
received 1 to 2 U, and 100 LEBs (5.3%) received ≥3 U transfusion. In the study 
cohort and group frequency matched cohort, transfusion was associated with 
significantly higher perioperative wound infection (0 U:4.8% vs 1 to 2 U: 6.5% 
vs ≥3 U: 14.0%; p = 0.0004) and graft thrombosis at discharge (4.5% vs 7.7% vs 
15.3%; p < 0.0001). At 1 year, there were no differences in infection or graft 
patency. In multivariate analysis, transfusion was independently associated with 
increased perioperative wound infection in the study cohort and group frequency 
matched cohort (1 to 2 U vs 0 U: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.4; 95% CI, 
0.8-2.5; p = 0.263; ≥3 U vs 0 U: OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8-6.7; p = 0.0002; overall 
p = 0.002) and increased graft thrombosis at discharge (1 to 2 U vs 0 U: OR = 
2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6; p = 0.01; ≥3 U vs 0 U: OR = 4.8; 95% CI, 2.5-9.2; p < 
0.0001, overall p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative transfusion in patients undergoing LEB is associated 
with increased perioperative wound infection and graft thrombosis. From this 
observational study, it appears transfusion does not have major consequences 
during mid-term follow-up, but the presumed benefits of blood replacement should 
be weighed carefully because of the increased risk of perioperative 
complications with transfusion.

Comment in
    Curr Biol. 2013 May 20;23(10):R451-3.

Large body size is one of the best predictors of long life span across species 
of mammals. In marked contrast, there is considerable evidence that, within 
species, larger individuals are actually shorter lived. This apparent cost of 
larger size is especially evident in the domestic dog, where artificial 
selection has led to breeds that vary in body size by almost two orders of 
magnitude and in average life expectancy by a factor of two. Survival costs of 
large size might be paid at different stages of the life cycle: a higher early 
mortality, an early onset of senescence, an elevated baseline mortality, or an 
increased rate of aging. After fitting different mortality hazard models to 
death data from 74 breeds of dogs, we describe the relationship between size and 
several mortality components. We did not find a clear correlation between body 
size and the onset of senescence. The baseline hazard is slightly higher in 
large dogs, but the driving force behind the trade-off between size and life 
span is apparently a strong positive relationship between size and aging rate. 
We conclude that large dogs die young mainly because they age quickly.

Metabolic complications of schizophrenia and antipsychotic medications--an 
updated review.

Author information:

Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors comprising obesity, 
dyslipidaemias, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance (or hyperinsulinaemia), 
and hypertension, and is highly predictive of type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
cardiovascular disease. The life expectancy of people with schizophrenia is 
reduced by 20%, with 60% of the excess mortality due to physical illness. 
Schizophrenia itself may be a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and there is 
also increasing concern that antipsychotic drugs, particularly second-generation 
antipsychotics, have metabolic consequences that contribute to the risk. Various 
diagnostic guidelines, updated facts with regard to epidemiology, 
pathophysiology, risk factors, and complications of metabolic syndrome are 
discussed in this review. Moreover, the impact of various antipsychotics on 
metabolic syndrome and their possible mechanisms are comprehensively reviewed. 
The authors emphasise that, while many adults with schizophrenia receive little 
or no medical care, such care is important given the risk of metabolic 
abnormalities associated not only with antipsychotic medications, but also with 
schizophrenia in general.
