vaccine is warranted. Besides various types of vaccines, microRNA and 
exosome-based vaccines have been emerged as new types of influenza vaccines 
which are associated with new and effective properties. Hence, development of a 
new generation of vaccines could contribute to better treatment of influenza.

Obesity is a major contributor to the greater prevalence of chronic disease 
morbidity and mortality observed in rural versus nonrural areas of the U.S. 
Nonetheless, little research attention has been given to modifying this 
important driver of rural/urban disparities in health outcomes. Although 
lifestyle treatments produce weight reductions of sufficient magnitude to 
improve health, the existing research is limited with respect to the long-term 
maintenance of treatment effects and the dissemination of services to 
underserved populations. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of 
delivering lifestyle programs through the infrastructure of the U.S. Cooperative 
Extension Service (CES), which has >2900 offices nationwide and whose mission 
includes nutrition education and health promotion. In addition, several 
randomized trials have shown that supplementing lifestyle treatment with 
extended-care programs consisting of either face-to-face sessions or individual 
telephone counseling can improve the maintenance of weight loss. However, both 
options entail relatively high costs that inhibit adoption in rural communities. 
The delivery of extended care via group-based telephone intervention may 
represent a promising, cost-effective alternative that is well suited to rural 
residents who tend to be isolated, have heightened concerns about privacy, and 
report lower quality of life. The Rural Lifestyle Eating and Activity Program 
(Rural LEAP) is a randomized trial, conducted via CES offices in rural 
communities, targeted to adults with obesity (n = 528), and designed to evaluate 
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of extended-care programs delivered via 
group or individual telephone counseling compared to an education control 
condition on long-term changes in body weight.

BACKGROUND: Health impact assessment (HIA) of exposure to air pollution is 
commonly based on city level (fine) particle concentration and may underestimate 
health consequences of changing local traffic. Exposure to traffic-related air 
pollution can be assessed at a high resolution by modelling levels of nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), which together with ultrafine particles mainly originate from 
diesel-powered vehicles in urban areas. The purpose of this study was to 
estimate the health benefits of reduced exposure to vehicle emissions assessed 
as NO2 at the residence among the citizens of Copenhagen Municipality, Denmark.
METHODS: We utilized residential NO2 concentrations modelled by use of chemistry 
transport models to calculate contributions from emission sources to air 
pollution. The DYNAMO-HIA model was applied to the population of Copenhagen 
Municipality by using NO2 concentration estimates combined with demographic data 
and data from nationwide registers on incidence and prevalence of selected 
diseases, cause specific mortality, and total mortality of the population of 
Copenhagen. We used exposure-response functions linking NO2 concentration 
estimates at the residential address with the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular 
diseases, and respiratory diseases derived from a large Danish cohort study with 
the majority of subjects residing in Copenhagen between 1971 and 2010. Different 
scenarios were modelled to estimate the dynamic impact of NO2 exposure on 
related diseases and the potential health benefits of lowering the NO2 level in 
the Copenhagen Municipality.
RESULTS: The annual mean NO2 concentration was 19.6 μg/m3 and for 70% of the 
population the range of exposure was between 15 and 21 μg/m3. If NO2 exposure 
was reduced to the annual mean rural level of 6 μg/m3, life expectancy in 2040 
would increase by one year. The greatest gain in disease-free life expectancy 
would be lifetime without ischemic heart disease (1.4 years), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (1.5 years for men and 1.6 years for women), and 
asthma (1.3 years for men and 1.5 years for women). Lowering NO2 exposure by 20% 
would increase disease-free life expectancy for the different diseases by 
0.3-0.5 years. Using gender specific relative risks affected the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the NO2 exposure by controlling traffic-related air 
pollution reduces the occurrence of some of the most prevalent chronic diseases 
and increases life expectancy. Such health benefits can be quantified by 
DYNAMO-HIA in a high resolution exposure modelling. This paper demonstrates how 
traffic planners can assess health benefits from reduced levels of 
traffic-related air pollution.

Background: With the increase of life expectancy, *On behalf of the REIN 
registry. end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is affecting a growing number of 
people. Simultaneously, renal replacement therapies (RRTs) have considerably 
improved patient survival. We investigated the way current RRT practices would 
affect patients' survival. Methods: We used a multi-state model to represent the 
transitions between RRTs and the transition to death. The concept of "crude 
probability of death" combined with this model allowed estimating the 
proportions of ESRD-related and ESRD-unrelated deaths. Estimating the 
ESRD-related death rate requires comparing the mortality rate between ESRD 
patients and the general population. Predicting patients' courses through RRTs 
and Death states could be obtained by solving a system of Kolmogorov 
differential equations. The impact of practice on patient survival was 
quantified using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) which was compared 
with that of healthy subjects with same characteristics. Results: The crude 
probability of ESRD-unrelated death was nearly zero in the youngest patients 
(18-45 years) but was a sizeable part of deaths in the oldest (≥70 years). 
Moreover, in the oldest patients, the proportion of expected death was higher in 
patient without vs. with diabetes because the former live older. In men aged 75 
years at first RRT, the predicted RMSTs in patients with and without diabetes 
were, respectively, 61% and 69% those of comparable healthy men. Conclusion: 
Using the concept of "crude probability of death" with multi-state models is 
feasible and useful to assess the relative benefits of various treatments in 
ESRD and help patient long-term management.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 
hospital-based and home-based exercise programs on quality of life (QOL) and 
neck and shoulder function of patients who underwent head and neck cancer (HNC) 
surgery.
METHODS: This clinical trial included 40 patients with neck and shoulder 
dysfunction after HNC. The exercise program included range of motion (ROM) 
exercises, massage, stretching, and strengthening exercises. Twenty patients who 
were assigned to the hospital-based exercise group performed physical therapy 
for 40 min three times a week for four weeks, and the remaining 20 patients were 
assigned to the home-based group. The European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), the 
EORTC Head and Neck Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-H&N), the Neck and Shoulder 
Disability Index (NDI), ROM, and numeric rating scale (NRS) were assessed before 
and after the exercise program. The program consisted of a 10-minute ROM to the 
neck and shoulder, a 10-minute massage, and 15 min of progressive resistance 
exercises, followed by a five-minute stretching exercise.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in the changes of neck 
and shoulder disability index (p < .05). Additionally, there were significant 
differences in neck extension and rotation ROM and NRS in the hospital-based 
group compared with the home-based group (p < .05). QOL was not significantly 
different between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Home-based exercise was effective for improving QOL, shoulder 
function, and pain relief. Hospital-based exercise had better effects on 
physical function of the neck and shoulder and reduced pain.

BACKGROUND: Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are threatening 
modern health care. However, estimating their incidence, complications, and 
attributable mortality is challenging. We aimed to estimate the burden of 
infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health concern in 
countries of the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015, measured in number 
of cases, attributable deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
METHODS: We estimated the incidence of infections with 16 antibiotic 
resistance-bacterium combinations from European Antimicrobial Resistance 
Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) 2015 data that was country-corrected for 
population coverage. We multiplied the number of bloodstream infections (BSIs) 
by a conversion factor derived from the European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control point prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections in 
European acute care hospitals in 2011-12 to estimate the number of non-BSIs. We 
developed disease outcome models for five types of infection on the basis of 
systematic reviews of the literature.
FINDINGS: From EARS-Net data collected between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we 
estimated 671 689 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 583 148-763 966) infections 
with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, of which 63·5% (426 277 of 671 689) were 
associated with health care. These infections accounted for an estimated 33 110 
(28 480-38 430) attributable deaths and 874 541 (768 837-989 068) DALYs. The 
burden for the EU and EEA was highest in infants (aged <1 year) and people aged 
65 years or older, had increased since 2007, and was highest in Italy and 
Greece.
INTERPRETATION: Our results present the health burden of five types of infection 
with antibiotic-resistant bacteria expressed, for the first time, in DALYs. The 
estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and 
EEA is substantial compared with that of other infectious diseases, and has 
increased since 2007. Our burden estimates provide useful information for public 
health decision-makers prioritising interventions for infectious diseases.

BACKGROUND: Understanding how prevalence, incidence, and mortality of motor 
neuron diseases change over time and by location is crucial for understanding 
the causes of these disorders and for health-care planning. Our aim was to 
produce estimates of incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) for motor neuron diseases for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 
2016 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2016.
METHODS: The motor neuron diseases included in this study were amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, 
primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, and pseudobulbar palsy. 
Incidence, prevalence, and DALYs were estimated using a Bayesian meta-regression 
model. We analysed 14 165 site-years of vital registration cause of death data 
using the GBD 2016 cause of death ensemble model. The 84 risk factors quantified 
in GBD 2016 were tested for an association with incidence or death from motor 
neuron diseases. We also explored the relationship between Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI; a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility) 
and age-standardised DALYs of motor neuron diseases.
FINDINGS: In 2016, globally, 330 918 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
299 522-367 254) individuals had a motor neuron disease. Motor neuron diseases 
have caused 926 090 (881 566-961 758) DALYs and 34 325 (33 051-35 364) deaths in 
2016. The worldwide all-age prevalence was 4·5 (4·1-5·0) per 100 000 people, 
with an increase in age-standardised prevalence of 4·5% (3·4-5·7) over the study 
period. The all-age incidence was 0·78 (95% UI 0·71-0·86) per 100 000 
person-years. No risk factor analysed in GBD showed an association with motor 
neuron disease incidence. The largest age-standardised prevalence was in high 
SDI regions: high-income North America (16·8, 95% UI 15·8-16·9), Australasia 
(14·7, 13·5-16·1), and western Europe (12·9, 11·7-14·1). However, the prevalence 
and incidence were lower than expected based on SDI in high-income Asia Pacific.
INTERPRETATION: Motor neuron diseases have low prevalence and incidence, but 
cause severe disability with a high fatality rate. Incidence of motor neuron 
diseases has geographical heterogeneity, which is not explained by any risk 
factors quantified in GBD, suggesting other unmeasured risk factors might have a 
role. Between 1990 and 2016, the burden of motor neuron diseases has increased 
substantially. The estimates presented here, as well as future estimates based 
on data from a greater number of countries, will be important in the planning of 
services for people with motor neuron diseases worldwide.

OBJECTIVE: To highlight the influence of environmental hazards and geographical 
degradation on population health status.
METHODS: The ecological study was conducted at the Institute of Health 
Management, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, and incorporated facts 
and figures gathered from primary and secondary data sources between November 
and December 2016. Employing proportionate quota sampling, data from both 
developed and developing countries was included. Parameters analysed included 
life expectancy, health expenditure characterising health profile, urbanisation, 
forest, agriculture land area proportions characterising geographic profile, and 
air, noise pollution index characterizing environmental profile. Data was 
analysed on Microsoft Excel 2016.
RESULTS: Of the 20 countries, 4(20%) were developed and 16(80%) were developing. 
Overall, 5(25%) countries, either considerably or modestly-forested were likely 
to be less polluted, while the opposite was true for 7(35%) others. Besides, 
7(44%) agrarian states -- 2(50%) developed and 5(31%) developing-- correlated 
sustenance proportionately with healthy prolonged life expectancy. Overall, 
15(75%) countries validated healthy life expectancy proportionate with health 
expenditure. The only exceptions were 5(31%) developing countries. Also, 14(70%) 
states associated urbanisation with health expense.
CONCLUSIONS: Growing urbanisation is the biggest threat to ecological resources. 
Plantation is an effective measure to address these challenges.

Life expectancy is increasing globally with the increase of aging populations. 
Care-dependent elderly and those with chronic illnesses and disabilities are 
increasing in numbers. Hospitalization to manage these problems lead to a heavy 
economic burden. Thus, the demand for home health care is rising causing a heavy 
workload for home workers. This study was aimed to assess problems of personnel 
engaged in providing home care. Data was colllected from 120 family physicians 
and nurses/midwives from 25 clinics. The results showed that most visits were 
provided for postnatal controls (69%), with only 13% provided for the elderly 
and disabled people despite high demands (for the elderly 73%; for those with 
disabilities 66%). Additionally, factors affecting workers emotionally in visits 
were evaluated. Difficulties and suggestions of home care workers should be 
considered that the quality of health care depends on the satisfaction of the 
care professionals as well as that of patients.

Androgen deprivation therapy has an important role in the medical treatment of 
advanced and metastatic prostate cancer The treatment of metastatic prostate 
cancer is influenced by whether the patient’s disease has progressed on androgen 
deprivation therapy or not. It is considered to be castrate-resistant disease if 
the cancer has progressed despite adequate suppression of androgens Chemotherapy 
using docetaxel or cabazitaxel and anti-androgen drugs such as abiraterone and 
enzalutamide can be used to treat castrate-resistant disease. Radium-223 is an 
option for patients with bony metastases Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate 
cancer is now considered a chronic illness as the life expectancy of patients 
has almost doubled due to the new treatments. General practitioners are 
therefore more likely to encounter patients with disease- and treatment-related 
complications

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), first described in 1834, is an X-linked 
dystrophinopathy, leading to early onset skeletal muscle weakness. Life 
expectancy is reduced to early adulthood as a result of involvement of voluntary 
skeletal muscles with respiratory failure, orthopedic deformities, and 
associated cardiomyopathy. Given its multisystem involvement, surgical 
intervention may be required to address the sequelae of the disease process. We 
present a 36-year-old adult with DMD, who required anesthetic care during 
surgical debridement of an ischial pressure sore. Given his significant 
respiratory muscle involvement, ultrasound-guided caudal epidural anesthesia was 
used instead of general during the surgical procedure. The technique and its 
applications are discussed, with particular emphasis on the feasibility and 
safety of using regional anesthetic techniques in patients with DMD.

BACKGROUND: The Joint External Evaluation (JEE) is part of the World Health 
Organization's (WHO) new process to help countries assess their ability to 
prevent, detect and respond to public health threats such as infectious disease 
outbreaks, as specified by the International Health Regulations (IHR). How 
countries are faring on these evaluations is not well known and neither is there 
any previous assessment of the performance characteristics of the JEE process 
itself.
METHODS: We obtained JEE data for 48 indicators collectively across 19 technical 
areas of preparedness for 55 countries. The indicators are scored on a 1 to 5 
scale with 4 indicating demonstrated capacity. We created a standardized JEE 
index score representing cumulative performance across indicators using 
principal components analysis. We examined the state of performance across all 
indicators and then examined the relationship between this index score and 
select demographic and health variables to better understand potential drivers 
of performance.
RESULTS: Among our study cohort, the median performance on 43 of the 48 (89.6%) 
indicators was less than 4, suggesting that countries were failing to meet 
demonstrated capacity on these measures. The two weakest indicators were related 
to antimicrobial resistance (median score = 1.0, interquartile range = 1.0-2.0) 
and biosecurity response (median score = 2.0, interquartile range = 2.0-3.0). 
JEE index scores correlated with various metrics of health outcomes (life 
expectancy, under-five year mortality rate, disability-adjusted life years lost 
to communicable diseases) and with standard measures of social and economic 
development that enable public health system performance in the total sample, 
but in stratified analyses, these relationships were much weaker in the AFRO 
region.
CONCLUSIONS: We find large variations in JEE scores among countries and WHO 
regions with many nations still unprepared for the next disease outbreak with 
pandemic potential The strong correlations between JEE performance and metrics 
of both health outcomes and health systems' performance suggests that the JEE is 
likely accurately measuring the strength of IHR-specific, public health 
capabilities.

Safe and effective lifelong treatment to control human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection is one of the greatest scientific and public health achievements 
of the past century. The majority of infected individuals able to maintain a 
daily oral regimen now have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. More than 
30 approved drugs and dozens of formulations have produced thousands of possible 
drug combinations used clinically in the past, but today most patients receive 
only a handful of high priority and rigorously tested regimens. Unique features 
of antiretroviral therapy include the need for lifelong treatment to control 
virus replication and the possibility of rapid emergence of permanent drug 
resistance if these agents are not properly used. Although three-drug 
combination oral regimens have radically altered the course of this epidemic, 
the future will include long-acting injectable and implantable drugs and devices 
to treat and prevent infection.

OBJECTIVES: Data related to the cost effectiveness of surgical interventions and 
catheter ablation is sparse. This model-based analysis assessed the clinical and 
economic trade-offs involved in using catheter ablation or the Cox maze 
procedure in treating patients with atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: A deterministic model was developed to project 1 year and lifetime 
health-related outcomes, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost 
effectiveness of each treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation. Using 
previously unpublished Inova Heart and Vascular Institute (IHVI) data for 
patients undergoing either procedure, 1 year cost and clinical efficacy inputs 
were estimated. This data was supplemented with published literature and used to 
estimate costs, utilities, mortality and likelihood of patient improvement. 
Results were reported as cost-effectiveness ratios in $/QALY. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of results.
RESULTS: Patients initially treated with a Cox maze procedure were estimated to 
have higher costs than those treated with catheter ablation, both after 1 year 
and over the lifetime. However, patients undergoing the Cox maze procedure also 
had lower rates of 1 year mortality than catheter ablation patients (3.5% vs. 
8.5%) and the highest rate of improvement following treatment, resulting in 
higher QALYs (12.4 vs. 10.2). Compared to catheter ablation, the lifetime 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the Cox maze surgical procedure was 
$12,794 per QALY gained. Without quality adjustment, the ratio was $11,315. 
Results were most sensitive to the likelihood of improvement following each 
intervention and the cost of the initial procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: At a societal willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY, Cox maze 
procedure was found to both increase overall and quality-adjusted survival and 
constitute an effective use of resources in patients with atrial fibrillation.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential cost-effectiveness of the 45-49 year old 
health check versus usual care in Australian general practice using secondary 
data sources.
METHOD: Risk factor profiles were generated for a hypothetical Australian cohort 
using data from the National Health Survey. Intervention effects were modelled 
based on a meta-analysis on risk factor changes in the 5 years after a health 
check. The Framingham Risk Equation was applied to estimate the 5-year 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in the health check and usual care group 
respectively. A Markov model was then constructed to extrapolate long-term CVD 
outcomes, health care costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in both 
groups. Health check-related costs, applied to the health check group, were 
estimated from clinical guideline and experts' opinion. Lifetime costs, applied 
to both groups, included costs of hospitalization for CVD events and associated 
post-event health service use. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) 
was calculated for male and female patients respectively.
RESULTS: Compared to usual care, the health check reduced CVD incidence for both 
males (RR = 0.87) and females (RR = 0.91) over a 5-year time. In a lifetime 
projection, health check led to an average 0.008 and 0.003 QALYs gained per male 
and female participants respectively. The estimates ICERs were AU $42,355 and AU 
$133,504 per QALY gained for males and females, respectively. A probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated a probability of cost-effectiveness of 17.5% 
and 0% for male and female attendees, assuming a willingness to pay threshold of 
AU $28,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: The 45-49 year old health check is associated with a small expected 
QALY gain per participant, though the persons avoiding CVD events experience 
large health gains. The mean ICER is larger than an empirical estimate of the 
threshold ICER and the evaluated health check is highly unlikely to be 
cost-effective.

Worldwide, over 77 million people have been infected by human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) but its cure remains elusive. Once considered a fatal disease, 
advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have dramatically increased the life 
expectancy of infected persons. Much progress has been made in the development 
and utilization of combination ART and preventative pre-exposure prophylaxis 
products, however, numerous obstacles prevent eradication. Clinical 
pharmacologists along with world health organizations continue to play a key 
role in identifying and implementing strategies to combat this disease.

BACKGROUND: The first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy resulted in a clinical 
efficacy for Chinese patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Some economic analyses have carried out various methods to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab as the first-line treatment for 
NSCLC in other countries. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone for the 
first-line treatment of advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.
METHODS: A Markov model was applied from the perspective of the Chinese health 
care system to assess cost-effectiveness. It was based on the clinical trial 
BEYOND that compared bevacizumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (B+CP) with placebo 
plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (PI+CP) for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Ten-year 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were calculated. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed.
RESULTS: QALYs were 1.17 years in the B+CP group and 0.83 years in the PI+CP 
group, resulting in a difference of 0.34 years. The ICER was $130,937.09/QALY, 
which was far beyond the willing-to-pay threshold of $24,314/QALY. At a 
threshold of $130,584/QALY, addition of bevacizumab had a 50% probability of 
being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab is not cost-effective when combined with chemotherapy 
for patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC based on the Chinese health care 
system, resulting in a less demand in the Chinese market.

BACKGROUND: Setting priorities for limited public resources has become a topic 
of heated discussion the world over. Assigning different weights for the health 
gains of different population groups allows for equity considerations in 
cost-effectiveness analysis. However, only a few empirical works have elicited 
the preferences of the general public.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the equity preferemce assigned by Japanese and Koreans.
METHODS: We conducted a Web-based survey in March 2013, including a discrete 
choice experiment, to elicit the equity preferences of the general public for 
the life expectancy gains of different population groups. We selected attributes 
and designed the experiment following Norman et al.'s study (Norman R, Hall J, 
Street D, Viney R. Efficiency and equity: a stated preference approach. Health 
Econ 2013;22:568-81). Accordingly, we analyzed preference for sex, smoking 
status, lifestyle, caring status, income, and age.
RESULTS: The Japanese assigned a higher preference for males (P < 0.001), 
nonsmokers (P < 0.001), those with lower income (P < 0.001), and carers (P < 0 
.001), and they assigned a lower preference for those with a life expectancy of 
60 years (P = 0.002) and 75-year-olds (P < 0.001). Koreans have the same 
patterns of preference for lower income (P < 0.001), caring (P < 0.001), and 
smoking status (P = 0.026). However, they prefer both sexes (P = 0.331) and 
different age groups equally. In both countries, respondents tend to prefer 
groups with characteristics similar to their own.
CONCLUSIONS: People from the two Asian developed countries, with universal 
health insurance, show different equity preferences. These may reflect the 
variations in cultural background and coverage of health care services.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the associations between individual income, all-cause 
mortality and use of healthcare resources in a very large population of chronic 
heart failure (CHF) patients living in Catalonia (Spain), where access to public 
healthcare is granted by law.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 2016 data from the Catalan Health Surveillance 
System, a large, exhaustive, administrative healthcare database which includes 
information on medical diagnoses, healthcare resource use, and individual income 
for all Catalan residents (N = 7,638,524). Individual annual income was 
categorized as high (>100,000€), medium (18,000-100,000€), low (<18,000€), and 
very low (welfare support). Among 155,883 CHF patients, lower individual income 
was associated with a shorter life expectancy at age 50 (life expectancy for 
high income patients 22.2 years, for very low income patients 12.8), and were 
independently associated with higher all-cause mortality adjusting for age, sex, 
comorbidities, and duration of the CHF diagnosis (odds ratio very low vs. medium 
income 1.21 [95% CI 1.11, 1.33]). Also, in patients with lower income levels the 
burden of public healthcare resource use was displaced towards urgent 
hospitalizations and frequent emergency department visits, as opposed to 
regular, specialized CHF ambulatory-based care.
CONCLUSION: In a very large population of CHF patients with access to universal 
healthcare, lower income was independently associated with higher mortality and 
with lower use of ambulatory-based healthcare resources. Our findings suggest 
that CHF patients may benefit from systematic assessment of their socioeconomic 
status, as this may aid the identification of vulnerable subgroups who may 
benefit from tailored health education and management.

OBJECTIVE: Restricting tobacco sales to pharmacies only, including the provision 
of cessation advice, has been suggested as a potential measure to hasten 
progress towards the tobacco endgame. We aimed to quantify the impacts of this 
hypothetical intervention package on future smoking prevalence, population 
health and health system costs for a country with an endgame goal: New Zealand 
(NZ).
METHODS: We used two peer-reviewed simulation models: 1) a dynamic population 
forecasting model for smoking prevalence and 2) a closed cohort multi-state 
life-table model for future health gains and costs by sex, age and ethnicity. 
Greater costs due to increased travel distances to purchase tobacco were treated 
as an increase in the price of tobacco. Annual cessation rates were multiplied 
with the effect size for brief opportunistic cessation advice on sustained 
smoking abstinence.
RESULTS: The intervention package was associated with a reduction in future 
smoking prevalence, such that by 2025 prevalence was 17.3%/6.8% for Māori 
(Indigenous)/non-Māori compared to 20.5%/8.1% projected under no intervention. 
The measure was furthermore estimated to accrue 41 700 discounted 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 33 500 to 51 
600) over the remainder of the 2011 NZ population's lives. Of these QALYs 
gained, 74% were due to the provision of cessation advice over and above the 
limiting of sales to pharmacies.
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides modelling-level evidence that the package of 
restricting tobacco sales to only pharmacies combined with cessation advice in 
these settings can accelerate progress towards the tobacco endgame, and achieve 
large population health benefits and cost-savings. :.
