OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of avoidable mortality on the changes in life 
expectancy at birth in Spain.
METHODS: Standard life table techniques and the Arriaga method were used to 
calculate and to decompose life expectancy (LE) changes by age, effects and 
groups of causes of avoidable mortality among three periods (1987-91, 1992-6 and 
1997-2001). A list of causes of avoidable mortality reached by consensus and 
previously published in Spain was used.
MAIN RESULTS: Life expectancy increased in all ages and both sexes. The main 
contribution to the increase of LE at birth was due to people over 50. Mortality 
in young adults produced a reduction in LE between the first two periods, but 
there was an important increase in LE between the last two periods; in both 
cases, this was the result of factors amenable to health policy interventions. 
The highest improvement in LE was due to non-avoidable causes, but avoidable 
mortality through health service interventions showed improvements in LE in 
those younger than 1 year and in those aged 45-75 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Making a distinction between several groups of causes of avoidable 
mortality and using decomposition by causes, ages and effects allowed us to 
better explain the impact of avoidable mortality on the LE of the whole 
population and gave a new dimension to this indicator that could be very useful 
in public health.

OBJECTIVES: The effects of non-occupational physical activity were assessed on 
the number of years lived with and without disability between age 50 and 80 
years.
METHODS: Using the GLOBE study and the Longitudinal Study of Aging, multi-state 
life tables were constructed yielding the number of years with and without 
disability between age 50 and 80 years. To obtain life tables by level of 
physical activity (low, moderate, high), hazard ratios were derived for 
different physical activity levels per transition (non-disabled to disabled, 
non-disabled to death, disabled to non-disabled, disabled to death) adjusted for 
age, sex and confounders.
RESULTS: Moderate, compared to low non-occupational physical activity reduced 
incidence of disability (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86), increased recovery (HR 
1.95, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.87), and represents a gain of disability-free years and a 
loss of years with disability (male 3.1 and 1.2; female 4.0 and 2.8 years). 
Performing high levels of non-occupational physical activity further reduced 
incidence, and showed a higher gain in disability-free years (male 4.1; female 
4.7), but a similar reduction in years with disability.
CONCLUSION: Among 50-80-year-olds promoting physical activity is a fundamental 
factor to achieve healthy ageing.

Clustering countries based on health outcomes is a useful technique for 
assessing global health disparities. However, data on country-specific 
indicators of health outcomes are inconsistent across databases from different 
sources, such as World Bank, WHO, and UNICEF. The new database on under-five 
child mortality from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation advances 
information about child mortality by showing both country-level estimates and 
confidence intervals. We used the new database for child mortality and WHO data 
for HALE from 160 countries to identify country clusters through model-based 
clustering techniques. The four clusters in 2000 and six in 2003, within levels 
of uncertainty, showed nonlinear distributions of health outcomes globally, 
indicating that no single trajectory for progression is evident. We propose the 
use of country clusters in further study of societal conditions that contribute 
to health outcomes and changes over time.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Silveira MG(1), Lindor KD.

Author information:

for Medical Education and Research, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease 
characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts, resulting in 
end-stage liver disease and reduced life expectancy. PSC primarily affects young 
and middle-aged men, often in association with underlying inflammatory bowel 
disease. The etiology of PSC includes immune-mediated components and elements of 
undefined nature. A cholestatic picture of liver biochemistries with elevations 
in serum alkaline phosphatase, nonspecific autoantibodies such as perinuclear 
antineutrophilic antibody, antinuclear antibodies and smooth muscle antibodies, 
and diffuse multifocal biliary strictures, resulting in a 'beaded' appearance on 
radiographic studies, are the hallmarks of the disease. No effective medical 
therapy is currently available, although clinical studies are in progress. 
Ursodeoxycholic acid at high doses (28 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day) is the most 
promising agent but is unproven so far. Liver transplantation is currently the 
only life-extending therapy for patients with end-stage disease, although 
recurrent disease can be observed in the transplanted liver. The multiple 
complications of PSC include pruritus, fatigue, vitamin deficiencies, metabolic 
bone disease, peristomal varices, bacterial cholangitis, dominant biliary 
strictures, gallbladder stones and polyps, and malignancy, particularly 
cholangiocarcinoma, which is the most lethal complication of PSC.

La cholangite sclérosante primaire (CSP) est une maladie hépatique cholestatique 
chronique caractérisée par une inflammation et une fibrose des canaux biliaires; 
elle provoque une maladie du foie terminale et abrège l’espérance de vie des 
patients. La CSP affecte principalement les hommes jeunes et d’âge moyen, 
souvent en lien avec une maladie inflammatoire de l’intestin sous-jacente. 
L’étiologie de la CSP inclut des composantes immunitaires et des éléments de 
nature indéterminée. Le tableau cholestatique des analyses biochimiques 
hépatiques avec élévation de la phosphatase alcaline sérique, la présence 
d’auto-anticorps non spécifiques tels qu’anticorps antineutrophiles 
périnucléaires, anticorps antinucléaires et anticorps anti-muscles lisses, en 
plus de strictures biliaires multifocales diffuses apparaissant en « collier de 
perles » à la radiographie, sont caractéristiques de la maladie. On ne dispose, 
pour l’instant, d’aucun traitement médicamenteux efficace, bien que certaines 
études cliniques soient en cours. L’acide ursodésoxycholique à forte dose (de 28 
mg/kg/jour à 30 mg/kg/jour) est l’agent le plus prometteur, mais son effet n’est 
pas encore éprouvé. La transplantation hépatique est actuellement le seul 
traitement qui puisse prolonger la vie des patients atteints de la maladie à un 
stade terminal, mais une récurrence de la maladie s’observe dans les foies 
transplantés. Parmi les multiples complications de la CSP, mentionnons le 
prurit, la fatigue, les carences vitaminiques, la maladie osseuse métabolique, 
les varices péristomiales, la cholangite bactérienne, les strictures biliaires 
dominantes, les calculs biliaires et les polypes et la néoplasie, 
particulièrement le cholangiocarcinome, qui est la complication la plus mortelle 
de la CSP.

The influence of subjective life expectancy on health state valuations using a 
10 year TTO.

van Nooten FE(1), Koolman X, Brouwer WB.

Author information:
(1)Department of Health Policy & Management, Erasmus University 
Rotterdam/Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

AIM: To investigate if subjective life expectancy (SLE) impacts the willingness 
to trade-off (WTT) and the number of years traded-off in a 10-years time 
trade-off (TTO) exercise to obtain health state valuations.
METHODS: An Internet-based questionnaire was administered in a sample 
representative for the Dutch general public. Next to basic demographic 
characteristics and SLE, respondents were asked to perform three TTO exercises. 
The following EQ-5D health states were included 21211 (TTO1), 22221 (TTO2) and 
33312 (TTO3). The WTT was studied using a probit regression model. The number of 
years traded-off was investigated using a generalized negative binomial 
regression model. The independent variables used in both models were age, 
gender, quality of life, education, the difference between age and expected age 
of death (SLE), and a variable indicating whether the SLE was less than 10 years 
(SLE<10).
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty nine respondents completed the questionnaire. 
The mean utility scores were 0.96 (TTO1), 0.94 (TTO2) and 0.79 (TTO3). The 
probit model showed that SLE was the only variable with a significant influence 
on WTT. The gnbreg showed that the number of years traded-off was also 
significantly influenced by SLE. In addition, age and education significantly 
influenced the number of years traded-off.
CONCLUSION: The WTT years and the number of years traded-off were both 
influenced by SLE in 10-years TTO exercises. Reducing remaining life expectancy 
to 10 years in a TTO may thus increase loss aversion and, especially in 
respondents losing relatively many expected life years, diminish WTT and the 
amount of time traded off.

"Prehabilitation" prior to CABG surgery improves physical functioning and 
depression.

Author information:

Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK. gf107@york.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Many patients demonstrate psychological distress and reduced 
physical activity before coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Here we 
evaluated the addition of a brief, cognitive-behavioural intervention (the 
HeartOp Programme) to routine nurse counselling for people waiting for CABG 
surgery.
METHODS: Randomised controlled trial comparing nurse counselling with the 
HeartOp programme to routine nurse counselling in 204 patients awaiting first 
time elective CABG. Primary outcome measures were: anxiety and length of 
hospital stay; secondary outcome measures were: depression, physical 
functioning, cardiac misconceptions and cost utility. Measures were collected 
prior to randomisation and after 8 weeks of their intervention prior to surgery, 
excepting length of hospital stay which was collected after discharge following 
surgery.
RESULTS: 100 patients were randomised to intervention, 104 to control. At 
follow-up there were no differences in anxiety or length of hospital stay. There 
were significant differences in depression (difference=7.79, p=0.008, 95% 
CI=2.04-13.54), physical functioning (difference=0.82, p=0.001, 95%CI=0.34-1.3) 
and cardiac misconceptions (difference=2.56, p<0.001, 95%CI=1.64-3.48) in favour 
of the HeartOp Programme. The only difference to be maintained following surgery 
was in cardiac misconceptions. The HeartOp Programme was found to have an 
Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of pound 288.83 per Quality-Adjusted 
Life Year.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurse counselling with the HeartOp Programme reduces depression and 
cardiac misconceptions and improves physical functioning before bypass surgery 
significantly more than nurse counselling alone and meets the accepted criteria 
for cost efficacy.

Is combined resynchronisation and implantable defibrillator therapy a 
cost-effective option for left ventricular dysfunction?

Bond M(1), Mealing S, Anderson R, Dean J, Stein K, Taylor RS.

Author information:

Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combined resynchronisation and 
implantable defibrillator therapy for left ventricular dysfunction and explore 
subgroups in which such devices might be most cost-effective.
DESIGN: Markov model-based economic evaluation.
SETTING: UK NHS.
PARTICIPANTS: A simulated mixed age cohort of NYHA class III and IV patients 
with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and prolonged QRS interval.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year gained over the 
patient lifetime.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of resynchronisation therapy alone 
compared with optimal medical therapy was pound16,735 (95% CI: pound14,630 to 
pound20,333) with a 91% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness to 
pay threshold of pound30,000. Compared with resynchronisation alone, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of combined implantable defibrillator was 
pound40,160 (95% CI: pound26,645 to pound59,391) with only a 26% probability of 
cost-effectiveness at the pound30,000 threshold. In a direct comparison across 
three treatments (medical treatment, resynchronisation alone and combined 
resynchronisation with implantable defibrillator therapy) resynchronisation 
alone was found to be the most cost-effective option.
CONCLUSION: Combined resynchronisation and implantable defibrillator therapy is 
not cost-effective for left ventricular dysfunction. Instead resynchronisation 
alone remains the most cost-effective policy option in this population. Combined 
devices are more likely to be cost-effective in the subgroups of younger 
patients or those with high risk of sudden cardiac death who would qualify for 
resynchronisation therapy.

I trace the evolution of ethical approaches to health policy in the United 
States and examine a number of critical unresolved issues pertaining to the 
current set of frameworks. Several themes emerge. First, fair procedures claim 
more attention than substantive and procedural principles. Second, in the case 
of public deliberation, more focus has been placed on factors such as procedural 
mechanisms than on understanding how individuals and groups value different 
aspects of health and agree on health-related decisions. Third, the nation needs 
workable frameworks to guide collective choices about valuable social ends and 
their trade-offs; purely procedural strategies are limited in illuminating 
overarching health policy and ethics questions. There is a need to integrate 
consequential and procedural approaches to health ethics and policy.

Surveillance for the management of small renal masses.

1090 Vienna, Austria.

Surveillance is a new management option for small renal masses (SRMs) in aged 
and infirm patients with short-life expectancy. The current literature on 
surveillance of SRM contains mostly small, retrospective studies with limited 
data. Imaging alone is inadequate for suggesting the aggressive potential of SRM 
for both diagnosis and followup. Current data suggest that a computed tomography 
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 3 months in the 1st year, every 6 
months in the next 2 years, and every year thereafter, is appropriate for 
observation. The authors rather believe in active surveillance with mandatory 
initial and followup renal tumor biopsies than classical observation. Since not 
all SRMs are harmless, selection criteria for active surveillance need to be 
improved. In addition, there is need for larger studies in order to better 
outline oncological outcome and followup protocols.

Cost-effectiveness of switching to biphasic insulin aspart in poorly-controlled 
type 2 diabetes patients in China.

Palmer JL(1), Gibbs M, Scheijbeler HW, Kotchie RW, Nielsen S, White J, Valentine 
WJ.

Author information:

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is an increasing problem in China, yet there is a 
paucity of data regarding the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological 
interventions in the Chinese setting.
METHODS: Previous data were obtained from PRESENT (Physicians' Routine 
Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of NovoMix 30 Therapy), a multi-country, 
single-arm, observational study where type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled 
with biphasic human insulin (BHI) were converted to biphasic insulin aspart 30 
(BIAsp30); the Chinese subgroup experienced an improvement in HbA(1c) and a 
reduction in hypoglycaemic events. A published and validated computer simulation 
model of diabetes (the CORE Diabetes Model) was used to estimate the long-term 
clinical and cost consequences of switching to BIAsp30 from BHI in the Chinese 
setting. Treatment effects and patient characteristics were derived from PRESENT 
and country-specific published sources. Primary research was performed to 
ascertain patient management practices and diabetes-related complication costs. 
Risks of modelled complications were derived from landmark clinical trials and 
epidemiological studies. Costs and clinical projections were made over patient 
lifetimes from a third-party payer perspective and discounted at 3% annually. 
Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Conversion to BIAsp30 from BHI was projected to improve discounted life 
expectancy by 0.38 years per patient (9.91 vs 9.53 years) and quality-adjusted 
life expectancy by 0.91 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient (6.32 vs 
5.41 QALYs). Conversion to BIAsp30 was associated with increased direct medical 
costs of Chinese Yuan (CNY) 1751 per patient, due to higher pharmacy and 
management costs (CNY +19,007), offset by reduced diabetes-related complication 
costs (CNY -17,254) over patient lifetimes. BIAsp30 was associated with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CNY 1926 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: BIAsp30 was projected to substantially improve clinical outcomes but 
was associated with increased lifetime medical costs. BIAsp30 would be 
considered cost-effective in China given a willingness-to-pay threshold of CNY 
100,000 per QALY gained in type 2 diabetes patients poorly controlled on BHI.

Although rarely observed, predation is thought to be an important factor in the 
evolution of primate life histories and behavior. Here I describe two incidents 
of snake predation on Cercopithecus mitis guenons from Kenya. The first case 
involved a juvenile blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni) in the Kakamega 
Forest, which died following a bite by a Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica gabonica). 
The snake's attempts to ingest its prey were unsuccessful. In the second 
incident, a juvenile Sykes monkey (Cercopithecus mitis albogularis) at Gede 
Ruins National Monument died suddenly after suffering symptoms that are 
characteristic of bites inflicted by black mambas (Dendroaspis polylepis). In 
both cases circumstantial evidence suggests that attacks occurred during 
extended play sessions in dense vegetation on or near the ground. If so, the 
observations support the hypothesis that play may be a costly activity.

OBJECTIVES: Overactive bladder may cause significant discomfort to patients. The 
standard therapy for overactive bladder includes behavioural therapy and 
sometimes medication. Recently, a new medication (solifenacin 5 and 10 mg) was 
developed for treatment of overactive bladder. The objective of this study was 
to assess the cost utility of solifenacin 5 and 10 mg for overactive bladder.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the cost per quality adjusted 
life years (QALY) over a period of 12-months. Model parameters were based on 
randomized clinical trials for solifenacin 5 and 10 mg. Data on utility scores 
were taken from the literature.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY for solifenacin 5 mg and solifenacin 10 
mg compared with placebo were 17,602 pounds and 24,464 pounds respectively. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust to changes of 
relevant input data.
CONCLUSION: Solifenacin 5 and 10 mg are cost-effective treatments in patients 
with overactive bladder.

OBJECTIVE: To develop an analysis scheme capturing the cognitive processes 
underlying QoL assessment to increase our understanding on how to interpret 
responses to QoL items. Tourangeau et al.'s (The psychology of survey response, 
2000) and Rapkin and Schwartz' (Health Qual Life Outcomes 2:14, 2004) cognitive 
process models form the basis for this analysis scheme.
METHODS: We conducted think aloud interviews with six cancer patients prior to 
and following radiotherapy to elicit the cognitive processes underlying the 
assessment of 7 EORTC QLQ-C30 items. Content analysis was carried out by two to 
four researchers independently. Eighty text fragments were analyzed inductively 
and combined in an iterative process with deductive analyses based on both 
models.
RESULTS: We have developed a comprehensive analysis scheme feasible for 
analyzing the cognitive processes underlying QoL assessment qualitatively. All 
cognitive components of both models could be distinguished in our data. The 
cognitive component 'reporting and response selection' needed extension to fully 
capture the cognitive processes used.
CONCLUSION: The two models combined are useful in describing the cognitive 
processes cancer patients use in answering QoL items, and as such facilitate 
insight into patients' self-reported QoL assessments. Interestingly, the content 
of the cognitive processes not only differed between patients but also between 
items within patients and over time.

Predictors of patient preferences and treatment choices for localized prostate 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding how patients select treatment for 
localized prostate cancer. This study examined determinants of patients' 
preferences for health states related to prostate cancer, and assessed whether 
preferences and/or other factors predict treatment choices.
METHODS: A survey of 167 patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer 
was conducted in 4 academic medical practices from 2004 to 2007. The authors 
assessed demographic and health factors, and used a time-tradeoff method to 
elicit preferences in the form of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) regarding 
health states related to prostate cancer. Linear regressions identified 
predictors of preferences (in QALYs) for erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary 
incontinence, rectal/bowel symptoms, and metastatic prostate cancer. Linear 
probability models identified predictors of treatment choice.
RESULTS: Patient preferences were affected by a range of behavioral, 
demographic, and health factors. For example, sexually active men reported 
significantly lower QALYs for living with ED, and men with family members who 
died of cancer reported lower QALYs for metastatic disease. The strongest 
predictor of treatment was the type of physician seen (radiation oncology vs 
urology) at the time of the survey. Age and tumor grade also were found to be 
strongly predictive of treatment. In general, QALYs were not found to predict 
treatment choice.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient preferences, as reported in QALYs, are shaped by reasonable 
behavioral and demographic influences. However, actual treatment choices appear 
to bear little relation to these patient preferences, and instead demonstrate a 
strong association with clinician specialty. More attention to variation in 
preferences among patients, as well as the use of decision-support technologies, 
may enable physicians to facilitate more optimal individualized treatment 
choices for patients with prostate cancer.

This research was undertaken to explore gender, religiosity, perceived 
time-left-to-live and the interactions between these variables as predictors of 
fear of death in 144 Atlantic Canadian students using the Multidimensional Fear 
of Death Scale (MFODS). Predictions about cause, age, marital status, and place 
of death were also derived from the Do-It-Yourself-Death-Certificate and 
compared with actuarial data to determine accuracy. Results showed significant 
gender effects on 2 MFODS subscales, such that women demonstrated greater fear 
for significant others and fear of the dead. More religious participants 
expressed greater fear of the dead, fear of being destroyed, and fear of 
conscious death, whereas participants with lower religious conviction were more 
fearful of the unknown. In addition, significant interactions between the 
predictors on various subscales of the MFODS were observed. Finally, both men 
and women made inaccurate death-related predictions when compared to actuarial 
data but predicted differential causes of death.

The cost-effectiveness of using hepatitis A/B combined vaccine versus hepatitis 
B vaccine alone for high-risk heterosexuals.

Previous studies estimated that vaccinating high-risk heterosexuals (HRH) with 
combination hepatitis A/B vaccine was a cost-effective alternative to 
vaccinating HRH against hepatitis B alone. Since then, the incidence of 
hepatitis A has declined dramatically in the United States. We re-estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of this policy accounting for modern declines in incidence. 
According to our estimates, vaccinating with combination vaccine resulted in a 
cost of $120,000 per quality adjusted life year gained (2.79 times the 2005 
United States Gross Domestic Product per capita), a ratio that is less favorable 
than those for most other vaccination strategies.

    Lancet. 2008 Oct 11;372(9646):1278-80.

BACKGROUND: In rural hospitals of developing countries, oxygen supplies are poor 
and detection of hypoxaemia is difficult. Oxygen concentrators and pulse 
oximeters might help to manage the disease; however, use of such technology in 
developing countries needs comprehensive assessment. We studied the effect of an 
improved oxygen system on death rate in children with pneumonia in Papua New 
Guinea.
METHODS: We installed an improved oxygen system in five hospitals in Papua New 
Guinea, and assessed its use in more than 11 000 children with pneumonia 
(2001-07) and compared case-fatality rates. Admissions between January, 2001, 
and December, 2004, formed the pre-intervention group, and those between July, 
2005, and October, 2007, formed the post-intervention group. Oxygen 
concentrators and pulse oximeters were introduced in the five hospitals, and a 
protocol for detection of hypoxaemia and clinical use of oxygen was supplied. 
All children admitted had their oxygen saturation measured; if it was less than 
90%, oxygen was delivered via nasal prongs at a starting flow rate of 0.5-1 
L/min. We recorded all costs associated with the establishment and maintenance 
of this system. The study was approved by the Medical Research Advisory 
Committee of Papua New Guinea, number MRAC 04.02.
FINDINGS: Before the use of this system, 356 of 7161 children admitted in the 
five hospitals for pneumonia died (case-fatality rate 4.97% [95% CI 4.5-5.5]), 
whereas 133 of 4130 children died in the 27 months after the introduction of the 
system (3.22% [2.7-3.8]). After the improved system was introduced, the risk of 
death for a child with pneumonia was 35% lower than was that before the project 
began (risk ratio 0.65 [0.52-0.78], p<0.0001). Mortality rates varied between 
hospitals. The estimated costs of this system were US$51 per patient treated, 
US$1673 per life saved, and US$50 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) 
averted.
INTERPRETATION: Pulse oximetry and oxygen concentrators can alleviate oxygen 
shortages, reduce mortality, and improve quality of care for children with 
pneumonia in developing countries. The cost-effectiveness of this system 
compared favourably with that of other public-health interventions.

Widening health inequalities among U.S. military retirees since 1974.

Edwards R(1).

Flushing, NY 11367, United States. redwards@qc.cuny.edu

I explore trends in mortality among U.S. military retirees using a new dataset 
of payroll records that include pay grade. Trends in mortality by pay grade 
reveal that health inequalities steadily widened between 1974 and 2004. Additive 
differentials in mortality rates remained stable, but since mortality declined 
exponentially, by a factor of about one third, proportional differentials in 
mortality and thus additive differentials in life expectancy have widened. The 
advantage in life expectancy enjoyed by retired officers grew roughly from 3 to 
4 years. The sources of these trends remain unclear and are beyond the ability 
of the data to inform, but the results bear implications for trends in 
inequality and for policy.

National food-fortification program with folic acid in Chile.

Hertrampf E(1), Cortés F.

Chile. ehertram@inta.cl

The Chilean Ministry of Health legislated to add folic acid (2.2 mg/100 g) to 
wheat flour to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTD), beginning in 
January 2000. This policy resulted in a significant increase in serum and red 
blood cell folate in women of childbearing age 1 year after fortification. The 
frequency of NTD was studied in all births, both live and stillbirths, in a 
prospective hospital-based design including 25% of national births during 
1999-2000 (prefortification period) and 2001-2002 (postfortification period). 
During the prefortification period, there was a total of 120,566 newborns, and 
the NTD rate was 17.1/10,000 births. During the postfortification period 
(2001-2002) there was a total of 117,704 newborns, and the NTD rate was 
significantly reduced by 43% to 9.7/10,000 births (RR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45 to 
0.71). This implies a reduction of 43% in the rate of NTD. The costs per NTD 
case and infant death averted were 1,200 international dollars (I$) and 
I$11,000, respectively. The cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
averted was I$91, or 0.8% of the country's per capita GDP. On the overall, 
fortification resulted in net cost savings of I$1.8 million. Fortification of 
wheat flour with folic acid has proven to be an effective and cost saving 
strategy for the primary prevention of NTD in a middle-income country in a 
postepidemiological transition, and in a dramatically short period of time.

Recently, Schulz and colleagues have contributed to the ongoing controversy on 
the unproven role of oxidative stress in the aging process in their 
well-performed study 'Glucose restriction extends Caenorhabditis elegans life 
span by inducing mitochondrial respiration and increasing oxidative stress' 
(Cell Metab 2007, 6: 280-293). Here, we suggest an alternative hypothesis that 
reductive stress can prevent calorie-restriction induced life span extension. We 
draw attention to this condition as an explanation for some contradictory 
observations including the deleterious effects from antioxidants.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost effectiveness and cost utility of sunitinib malate 
as a first-line treatment in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) compared 
with interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) from a US societal 
perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression and to 
determine progression-free survival, total life-years (LYs), and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Model parameters were derived from 
the pivotal trial of sunitinib, published literature, government sources, and 
clinical experts' opinions. The model included trial-based adverse events (AEs). 
Costs of drug treatment, routine follow-up, AEs, disease progression, and best 
supportive care (BSC) of terminally ill patients were included. Results were 
tested using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Treatment with sunitinib is associated with a gain in progression-free 
years of 0.41 and 0.35 over IFN-alpha and IL-2. The estimated gains over 
IFN-alpha were 0.11 LYs and 0.14 QALYs, and over IL-2 were 0.24 LYs and 0.20 
QALYs. Both IFN-alpha and sunitinib treatments dominate IL-2 treatment; the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of sunitinib versus IFN-alpha was $18,611 
per progression-free year gained and $67,215 per LY gained, and the cost-utility 
ratio is $52,593 per QALY gained (at a 5% discount rate). Sensitivity analyses 
found the results to be most sensitive to utility values during treatment, the 
cost of sunitinib, and the cost of BSC. Model results were robust to changes in 
other model variables.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that sunitinib is a cost-effective alternative 
to IFN-alpha as a first-line treatment for mRCC.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is aptly called the modern day 
'plague' and has the potential to decimate people in the productive age group. 
On the other hand, the increasing life expectancy in developing countries 
spirals age-related blindness. One therefore reduces economic productivity while 
the other increases economic dependency. Both lead to increased expenditure of 
households though in different proportions. Human immunodeficiency virus and 
blindness are both associated with discrimination, stigma and long-term 
consequences. They impact the socioeconomic fabric of the affected individuals, 
communities and countries. The loss in productivity and the cost of support to 
the affected individuals are seen in both. Each is a potent problem on its own 
but together they spell disaster in geometric proportions rather than a simple 
additive effect. Strategies need to be evolved to provide solace and improve the 
quality of life of an HIV-positive blind individual.

BACKGROUND: Gender is an important health determinant for public health 
policies. This study describes the changes in gender development inequalities in 
Spain and its autonomous regions from 1990 to 2000.
METHODS: An ecological study using the Human Development Index (HDI) and the 
Gender Development Index (GDI) was done. IDG both men and women was analysed 
according to indexes of education, income and life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: Although the GDI has had an increase of 5,05% in the 90 s, 51,5% of the 
population was located above the global GDI of Spain in 1990, moreover this 
number decreased to 46,3% in 2000. Gender inequalities have been reduced both at 
national and regional levels. The regions with the lowest increase were Asturias 
(3.37%), Cantabria (3.68%) and Baleares Islands (3.71%). The regions with the 
highest increase were Madrid (6,46%) and Extremadura (6,75%). All the autonomous 
regions showed a number of GDI lower than the value of HDI. Both sexes achieved 
similar increase in life expectancy (Men: 5% and Women: 4%). An unequal 
variation was detected according to the autonomous region (Basque Country; Men: 
7% and Women: 3%; Madrid; Men:8% and Women:5%). Women have improved their 
educational level in comparison to men (Men: 3% and Women: 6%). In the 90 s, men 
obtained more income than women, but women improved their situation three times 
more than men.
CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in Human Development analysed by gender have been 
reduced in the 90 s in Spain. However, the improvement of education, income and 
life expectancy occurred only in some autonomous regions. This situation shows 
the differences among Spanish autonomous regions.

Brief communication: dental development and enamel thickness in the Lakonis 
Neanderthal molar.

Developmental and structural affinities between modern human and Neanderthal 
dental remains continue to be a subject of debate as well as their utility for 
informing assessments of life history and taxonomy. Excavation of the Middle 
Paleolithic cave site Lakonis in southern Greece has yielded a lower third molar 
(LKH 1). Here, we detail the crown development and enamel thickness of the 
distal cusps of the LKH 1 specimen, which has been classified as a Neanderthal 
based on the presence of an anterior fovea and mid-trigonid crest. Crown 
formation was determined using standard histological techniques, and enamel 
thickness was measured from a virtual plane of section. Developmental 
differences include thinner cuspal enamel and a lower periodicity than modern 
humans. Crown formation in the LKH 1 hypoconid is estimated to be 2.6-2.7 years, 
which is shorter than modern human times. The LKH 1 hypoconid also shows a more 
rapid overall crown extension rate than modern humans. Relative enamel thickness 
was approximately half that of a modern human sample mean; enamel on the distal 
cusps of modern human third molars is extremely thick in absolute and relative 
terms. These findings are consistent with recent studies that demonstrate 
differences in crown development, tissue proportions, and enamel thickness 
between Neanderthals and modern humans. Although overlap in some developmental 
variables may be found, the results of this and other studies suggest that 
Neanderthal molars formed in shorter periods of time than modern humans, due in 
part to thinner enamel and faster crown extension rates.

The amount of aged and old aged people is increasing markedly in all 
industrialized nations as well as in many developing countries. Additionally to 
the increasing life expectancy, a trend towards voluntary childlessness is 
observable. This trend will not only result in a continuing change of the 
population structure, it will also result in several individual problems of the 
aged population caused by childlessness. In the present paper the possible 
effects of voluntary childlessness on quality of life during old age are 
discussed from an anthropological point of view.

Protein and peptides in pictures: imaging with MALDI mass spectrometry.

Goodwin RJ(1), Pennington SR, Pitt AR.

Author information:
(1)Institute of Biomedical and Life Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.

Imaging using MS has the potential to deliver highly parallel, multiplexed data 
on the specific localization of molecular ions in tissue samples directly, and 
to measure and map the variations of these ions during development and disease 
progression or treatment. There is an intrinsic potential to be able to identify 
the biomarkers in the same experiment, or by relatively simple extension of the 
technique. Unlike many other imaging techniques, no a priori knowledge of the 
markers being sought is necessary. This review concentrates on the use of 
MALDI-MS for MS imaging (MSI) of proteins and peptides, with an emphasis on 
mammalian tissue. We discuss the methodologies used, their potential 
limitations, overall experimental considerations and progress that has been made 
towards establishing MALDI-MSI as a routine technique for the spatially resolved 
measurement of peptides and proteins. As well as determining the local abundance 
of individual molecular ions, there is the potential to determine their identity 
within the same experiment using relatively simple extensions of the basic 
techniques. In this way MSI offers an important opportunity for biomarker 
discovery and identification.

Medical University, Tehran, Iran. b_moghimi_de@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of this study was to calculate survival rates and 
analyze patterns of survival in gastric cancer.
METHODS: A total number of 746 patients with gastric cancer registered in the 
Cancer Registry Center of Research Center of Gastroenterology and Liver Disease 
of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Iran, from Dec 21, 2001 to 
Dec 21, 2006 were investigated. 1- to 5-year survival rates were estimated using 
life-table method and compared by Wilcoxon (Gehan) test. P<0.05 was considered 
as statistically significant. All calculations were carried out with SPSS 
(version 13.0) statistical software.
RESULTS: There were 530 male patients with a mean age of 60.5+/-12.6 years and 
216 females with a mean age of 57.5+/-13.5 years. Of the total, 454 died and 285 
were censored during the investigation. The median survival time was 24.2 months 
and survival rates at one, two, third, fourth and five years after diagnosis 
were 73.6, 50.2, 40.6, 33.2 and 29.7%, respectively. Stages of tumor, histology 
grade, histologic type of cancer, tumor size, age at diagnosis and surgery 
approach were independent prognostic factors . However, variables such as sex 
(P=.533), body mass index (P=.214), ethnicity (P=.092), and level of education 
(P=.762) did not shown significant effects on survival.
CONCLUSION: Early detection of patients at lower age and with primary stages and 
grades of tumor is important to increase patient's life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the hypothesis that better health status of elderly 
populations is primarily determined by the provision of freely accessible health 
service at low or no cost to the user and a social welfare system.
METHOD: Information was collected by questionnaire from surveys of three cohorts 
of elderly (70 years and older) Chinese. Data from two health-care systems were 
compared: the low-cost or free government-subsidized system in Hong Kong, and 
the market-orientated user-pays system in urban (Beijing), and rural China.
RESULTS: The Beijing rural cohort had the best health profile, whereas the Hong 
Kong cohort had the worst, despite the better lifestyle practices in the Hong 
Kong and Beijing urban cohorts compared with the Beijing rural cohort, and 
higher socioeconomic status in the Beijing urban and Hong Kong cohorts. However, 
the Beijing rural cohort had the highest prevalence of functional limitations.
CONCLUSION: While health-care systems may affect life expectancy at birth,
