and rehabilitation, the findings and methods presented in this pilot economic 
evaluation could guide the assessment of future assistive "e-health" 
technologies. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION The methods presented in this 
pilot economic evaluation have large potentials to guide the assessment of 
future assistive e-health technologies addressing work-disabilities. The 
findings show that the web-based tool requires content related improvements with 
respect to targeting and intensity to enhance employability among work disabled 
employees. The findings show that the web-based tool would benefit from 
improvements related to the study design by more adequately selecting and 
collecting both outcome measures and cost data. The burden attributable to 
large-scale studies and implementation issues were prevented as the outcomes of 
the pilot economic evaluation did not support the implementation of the 
web-based tool.

Policy makers in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) are 
increasingly looking to develop 'evidence-based' frameworks for identifying 
priority health interventions. This paper synthesises and appraises the 
literature on methodological frameworks--which incorporate economic evaluation 
evidence--for the purpose of setting healthcare priorities in LMICs. A 
systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, Econlit and PubMed identified 3968 
articles with a further 21 articles identified through manual searching. A total 
of 36 papers were eligible for inclusion. These covered a wide range of health 
interventions with only two studies including health systems strengthening 
interventions related to financing, governance and human resources. A little 
under half of the studies (39%) included multiple criteria for priority setting, 
most commonly equity, feasibility and disease severity. Most studies (91%) 
specified a measure of 'efficiency' defined as cost per disability-adjusted life 
year averted. Ranking of health interventions using multi-criteria decision 
analysis and generalised cost-effectiveness were the most common frameworks for 
identifying priority health interventions. Approximately a third of studies 
discussed the affordability of priority interventions. Only one study identified 
priority areas for the release or redeployment of resources. The paper concludes 
by highlighting the need for local capacity to conduct evaluations (including 
economic analysis) and empowerment of local decision-makers to act on this 
evidence.

While glucose is the fundamental source of energy in most eukaryotes, it is not 
always abundantly available in natural environments, including within the human 
body. Eukaryotic cells are therefore thought to possess adaptive mechanisms to 
survive glucose-limited conditions, which remain unclear. Here, we report a 
novel mechanism regulating cell cycle progression in response to abrupt changes 
in extracellular glucose concentration. Upon reduction of glucose in the medium, 
wild-type fission yeast cells undergo transient arrest specifically at G2 phase. 
This cell cycle arrest is dependent on the Wee1 tyrosine kinase inhibiting the 
key cell cycle regulator, CDK1/Cdc2. Mutant cells lacking Wee1 are not arrested 
at G2 upon glucose limitation and lose viability faster than the wild-type cells 
under glucose-depleted quiescent conditions, suggesting that this cell cycle 
arrest is required for extension of chronological lifespan. Our findings 
indicate the presence of a novel cell cycle checkpoint monitoring glucose 
availability, which may be a good molecular target for cancer therapy.

Free-ranging dogs are a ubiquitous part of human habitations in many developing 
countries, leading a life of scavengers dependent on human wastes for survival. 
The effective management of free-ranging dogs calls for understanding of their 
population dynamics. Life expectancy at birth and early life mortality are 
important factors that shape life-histories of mammals. We carried out a five 
year-long census based study in seven locations of West Bengal, India, to 
understand the pattern of population growth and factors affecting early life 
mortality in free-ranging dogs. We observed high rates of mortality, with only 
~19% of the 364 pups from 95 observed litters surviving till the reproductive 
age; 63% of total mortality being human influenced. While living near people 
increases resource availability for dogs, it also has deep adverse impacts on 
their population growth, making the dog-human relationship on streets highly 
complex.

IMPORTANCE: Burden of disease should impact research prioritisation.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and 
determine whether systematic reviews and protocols accurately represent disease 
burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 Study.
METHODS: Two investigators collected GBD disability metrics for 12 external 
causes of injury in the GBD 2010 Study. These external causes were then assessed 
for systematic review and protocol representation in CDSR. Data was collected 
during the month of April 2015. There were no study participants aside from the 
researchers. Percentage of total 2010 DALYs, 2010 DALY rank, and median DALY 
percent change from 1990 to 2010 of the 12 external causes of injury were 
compared with CDSR representation of systematic reviews and protocols. Data were 
analysed for correlation using Spearman rank correlation.
RESULTS: Eleven of the 12 causes were represented by at least one systematic 
review or protocol in CDSR; the category collective violence and legal 
intervention had no representation in CDSR. Correlation testing revealed a 
strong positive correlation that was statistically significant. Representation 
of road injury; interpersonal violence; fire, heat, and hot substances; 
mechanical forces; poisonings, adverse effect of medical treatment, and animal 
contact was well aligned with respect to DALY. Representation of falls was 
greater compared to DALY, while self-harm, exposure to forces of nature, and 
other transport injury representation was lower compared to DALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CDSR representation of external causes of injury 
strongly correlates with disease burden. The number of systematic reviews and 
protocols was well aligned for seven out of 12 causes of injury. These results 
provide high-quality and transparent data that may guide future prioritisation 
decisions.

The ageing of the population is associated with an increase in the incidence of 
chronic renal failure. Management of the condition must be adapted to the 
specificities linked to ageing. With end-stage renal failure, haemodialysis is a 
substitution technique offered under certain conditions. The central role of the 
caregivers is to support and guide the elderly person along their care pathway. 
Faced with a reduced life expectancy, the aim of all concerned is to strike a 
balance between an effective treatment and quality of life.

The life expectancy of persons with hemophilia (PWH) has increased almost 
10-fold over the past seven decades, largely due to access to safe factor 
replacement products. Concomitant with this success, however, comes the burden 
of aging. Older PWH are developing similar comorbidities as the general 
population, including increasing rates of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, 
which predispose them to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
and chronic kidney disease (CKD). How their coagulopathy affects the expression 
of these conditions remains unclear. In addition, the elderly hemophilia 
population must cope with chronic joint arthropathy, which provokes falls and 
fractures, and complications related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, which greatly impact the incidence of cancer 
and liver disease. With a dearth of evidence-based guidelines to direct therapy, 
a new challenge has arisen for hematologists to optimally manage these complex 
age-related issues. This review will focus on common complications affecting the 
older hemophilia population, including joint disease, CVD, malignancy, renal 
insufficiency, and liver disease.

BACKGROUND: The Renal Physicians Association's clinical practice guideline 
recommends that physicians address advance care planning with dialysis patients. 
However, data are lacking about how best to implement this recommendation.
STUDY DESIGN: Quality improvement project.
SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: Nephrologists caring for patients treated with 
maintenance hemodialysis at 2 dialysis facilities identified patients who might 
benefit most from advance care planning using the "surprise" question ("Would I 
be surprised if this patient died in the next year?").
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Patients identified with a "no" response to the 
surprise question were invited to participate in nephrologist-facilitated 
advance care planning, including completion of a Medical Orders for 
Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form.
OUTCOMES: Change in MOLST completion rate and identification of preferences for 
limits on life-sustaining treatment.
MEASUREMENTS: Pre- and postintervention code status, MOLST completion rate, and 
vital status at 1 year.
RESULTS: Nephrologists answered "no" to the surprise question for 50 of 201 
(25%) hemodialysis patients. Of these, 41 (82%) patients had a full-code status 
and 9 (18%) had a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. Encounters lasted 15 to 60 
minutes. Following the encounter, 21 (42%) patients expressed preference for a 
DNR status and 29 (58%) maintained full-code status (P=0.001). The MOLST 
completion rate increased from 10% to 90%. One-year survival for patients whose 
nephrologists answered "no" to the surprise question was 58% compared to 92% for 
those with a "yes" answer (P<0.001).
LIMITATIONS: Sample size and possible nonrepresentative dialysis population.
CONCLUSIONS: Nephrologist-facilitated advance care planning targeting 
hemodialysis patients with limited life expectancy led to significant changes in 
documented patient preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and limits on 
life-sustaining treatment. These changes demonstrate the benefit of advance care 
planning with dialysis patients and likely reflect better understanding of 
end-of-life treatment options.

Phospholipase D (PLD) is involved in the regulation of receptor-associated 
signaling, cell movement, cell adhesion and endocytosis. However, its 
physiological role in vertebrate development remains poorly understood. In this 
study, we show that PLD1 is required for the convergent extension (CE) movements 
during Xenopus gastrulation by activating Wnt/PCP signaling. Xenopus PLD1 
protein is specifically enriched in the dorsal region of Xenopus gastrula embryo 
and loss or gain-of-function of PLD1 induce defects in gastrulation and CE 
movements. These defective phenotypes are due to impaired regulation of Wnt/PCP 
signaling pathway. Biochemical and imaging analysis using Xenopus tissues reveal 
that PLD1 is required for Fz7 receptor endocytosis upon Wnt11 stimulation. 
Moreover, we show that Fz7 endocytosis depends on dynamin and regulation of GAP 
activity of dynamin by PLD1 via its PX domain is crucial for this process. Taken 
together, our results suggest that PLD1 acts as a new positive mediator of 
Wnt/PCP signaling by promoting Wnt11-induced Fz7 endocytosis for precise 
regulation of Xenopus CE movements.

Exploring the influence of context and policy on health district productivity in 
Cambodia.

BACKGROUND: Cambodia has been reconstructing its economy and health sector since 
the end of conflict in the 1990s. There have been gains in life expectancy and 
increased health expenditure, but Cambodia still lags behind neighbours One 
factor which may contribute is the efficiency of public health services. This 
article aims to understand variations in efficiency and the extent to which 
changes in efficiency are associated with key health policies that have been 
introduced to strengthen access to health services over the past decade.
METHODS: The analysis makes use of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to measure 
relative efficiency and changes in productivity and regression analysis to 
assess the association with the implementation of health policies. Data on 28 
operational districts were obtained for 2008-11, focussing on the five provinces 
selected to represent a range of conditions in Cambodia. DEA was used to 
calculate efficiency scores assuming constant and variable returns to scale and 
Malmquist indices to measure productivity changes over time. This analysis was 
combined with qualitative findings from 17 key informant interviews and 19 
in-depth interviews with managers and staff in the same provinces.
RESULTS: The DEA results suggest great variation in the efficiency scores and 
trends of scores of public health services in the five provinces. Starting 
points were significantly different, but three of the five provinces have 
improved efficiency considerably over the period. Higher efficiency is 
associated with more densely populated areas. Areas with health equity funds in 
Special Operating Agency (SOA) and non-SOA areas are associated with higher 
efficiency. The same effect is not found in areas only operating voucher 
schemes. We find that the efficiency score increased by 0.12 the year any of the 
policies was introduced.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study published on health district productivity 
in Cambodia. It is one of the few studies in the region to consider the impact 
of health policy changes on health sector efficiency. The results suggest that 
the recent health financing reforms have been effective, singly and in 
combination. This analysis could be extended nationwide and used for targeting 
of new initiatives. The finding of an association between recent policy 
interventions and improved productivity of public health services is relevant 
for other countries planning similar health sector reforms.

Recent progress in cancer treatment has improved patient survival, but has 
increased the number of patients with metastatic bone tumors. Data were 
collected from all bone metastasis patients at Kagoshima University, where 
almost all patients with metastatic bone tumors who reside in Kagoshima province 
are treated surgically. The scoring systems used in bone metastasis patients 
were then evaluated to identify those most suitable for our patients. Clinical 
data were collected from 145 patients with bone metastases. The patients were 
assigned prognostic scores based on four scoring systems, namely those described 
by the Ratasvuori, Mizumoto, Tokuhashi and Katagiri groups. Statistical 
examinations were performed to assess patient distribution regarding prognostic 
factors and the four data sets reported in the literature. The patient 
distributions for all prognostic factors were significantly different between 
the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG) and Kagoshima data. The distributions of 
patients for 3 of 5 and for 5 of 7 prognostic factors were statistically 
different between the Kagoshima data and the Katagiri and Tokuhashi data, 
respectively. Additionally, the distribution of patients in each scoring group 
was statistically different between the Kagoshima data and the Katagiri, 
Tokuhashi and Mizumoto data. The predictions of prognosis were significantly 
different between the results of each group and ours. The Tokuhashi scoring 
system detected the highest survival at 6 months (88.8%) in the Kagoshima data. 
Patients with a life expectancy of >6 months benefited from tumor excision and 
reconstruction. These findings suggest that the Tokuhashi scoring system is the 
most suitable for identifying patients who should be assessed for curative 
surgical intervention. SSG scoring, however, was suitable for identifying 
patients expected to survive for <6 months (91.3%). Prior to selecting a scoring 
system to predict prognosis, it is important to determine which scoring system 
is the most appropriate, based on each hospital's particular characteristics.

PURPOSE: Epilepsy is one of the most common manifestations in gliomas and has a 
severe effect on the life expectancy and quality of life of patients. The aim of 
our study was to assess the potential connections between clinicopathological 
factors and postoperative seizure.
METHOD: We retrospectively investigated a group of 147 Chinese high-grade glioma 
(HGG) patients with preoperative seizure to examine the correlation between 
postoperative seizure and clinicopathological factors and prognosis. Univariate 
analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to 
identify factors associated with postoperative seizures. Survival function 
curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: 53 patients (36%) were completely seizure-free (Engel class I), and 94 
(64%) experienced a postoperative seizure (Engel classes II, III, and IV). A 
Chi-squared analysis showed that anaplastic oligodendroglioma/anaplastic 
oligoastrocytoma (AO/AOA) (P=0.05), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
expression (P=0.0004), O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) 
expression (P=0.011), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression 
(P=0.045) were all significantly different. A logistic regression analysis 
showed that MGMT expression (P=0.05), EGFR expression (P=0.001), and AO/AOA 
(P=0.038) are independent factors of postoperative seizure. Patients with lower 
MGMT and EGFR expression and AO/AOA showed more frequent instances of 
postoperative seizure. Postoperative seizure showed no statistical significance 
on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
CONCLUSION: Our study identified clinicopathological factors related to 
postoperative seizure in HGGs and found two predictive biomarkers of 
postoperative seizure: MGMT and EGFR. These findings provided insight treatment 
strategies aimed at prolonging survival and improving quality of life.

Background Population aging brings up a number of health issues, one of which is 
an increased incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) and its complication, post-herpetic 
neuralgia (PHN). Zostavax vaccine has recently become available to prevent HZ 
and PHN. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against HZ 
in Spain considering a vaccination of the population aged 50 years and older and 
comparing this to the current situation where no vaccination is being 
administered. Methods An existing, validated, and published economic model was 
adapted to Spain using relevant local input parameters and costs from 2013. 
Results Vaccinating 30% of the Spanish population aged 50 years and older 
resulted in â¬16,577/QALY gained, â¬2025/HZ case avoided, and â¬5594/PHN case 
avoided under the third-party payer perspective. From a societal perspective, 
the ICERs increased by 6%, due to the higher price of the vaccine. The number 
needed to vaccinate to prevent one case was 20 for HZ, and 63 for PHN3. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that the model was most sensitive to the HZ and PHN 
epidemiological data, the health state utilities values, and vaccine price used. 
Conclusion Considering an acceptable range of cost-effectiveness of 
â¬30,000-â¬50,000 per QALY gained, vaccination of the 50+ population in Spain 
against HZ with a new vaccine, Zostavax, is cost-effective and makes good use of 
the valuable healthcare budget.

BACKGROUND: The possibility of incorporating generics into combination 
antiretroviral therapy and breaking apart once-daily single-tablet regimens 
(STRs), may result in less efficacious medications and/or more complex regimens 
with the expectation of marked monetary savings. A modeling approach that 
assesses the merits of such policies in terms of lifelong costs and health 
outcomes using adherence and effectiveness data from real-world U.S. settings.
METHODS: A comprehensive computer-based microsimulation model was developed to 
assess the lifetime health (life expectancy and quality adjusted 
life-years--QALYs) and economic outcomes in HIV-1 infected patients initiating 
STRs compared with multiple-table regimens including generic medications where 
possible (gMTRs). The STRs considered included tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate/emtricitabine and efavirenz or rilpivirine or elvitegravir/cobicistat. 
gMTRs substitutions included each counterpart to STRs, including generic 
lamivudine for emtricitabine and generic versus branded efavirenz.
RESULTS: Life expectancy is estimated to be 1.301 years higher (discounted 0.619 
QALY gain) in HIV-1 patients initiating a single-tablet regimen in comparison to 
a generic-based multiple-table regimen. STRs were associated with an average 
increment of $26,547.43 per patient in medication and $1,824.09 in other medical 
costs due to longer survival which were partially offset by higher inpatients 
costs ($12,035.61) with gMTRs treatment. Overall, STRs presented incremental 
lifetime costs of $16,335.91 compared with gMTRs, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $26,383.82 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: STRs continue to represent good value for money under contemporary 
cost-effectiveness thresholds despite substantial price reductions of generic 
medications in the U. S.

BACKGROUND: Strategies to improve the life of patients suffering from recurrent 
major depression have a high relevance. This study examined the efficacy of 2 
Internet-delivered augmentation strategies that aim to prolong symptom-free 
intervals.
METHODS: Efficacy was tested in a 3-arm, multicenter, open-label, 
evaluator-blind, randomized controlled trial. Upon discharge from inpatient 
mental health care, 232 adults with 3 or more major depressive episodes were 
randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups (SUMMIT or SUMMIT-PERSON) or to 
treatment as usual (TAU) alone. Over 12 months, participants in both 
intervention arms received, in addition to TAU, intense monitoring via e-mail or 
a smartphone, including signaling of upcoming crises, assistance with personal 
crisis management, and facilitation of early intervention. SUMMIT-PERSON 
additionally offered regular expert chats. The primary outcome was 'well weeks', 
i.e. weeks with at most mild symptoms assessed by the Longitudinal Interval 
Follow-Up Evaluation, during 24 months after the index treatment.
RESULTS: SUMMIT compared to TAU reduced the time with an unwell status (OR 0.48; 
95% CI 0.23-0.98) through faster transitions from unwell to well (OR 1.44; 95% 
CI 0.83-2.50) and slower transitions from well to unwell (OR 0.69; 95% CI 
0.44-1.09). Contrary to the hypothesis, SUMMIT-PERSON was not superior to either 
SUMMIT (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.38-1.56) or TAU (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.31-1.24). The 
efficacy of SUMMIT was strongest 8 months after the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The fully automated Internet-delivered augmentation strategy SUMMIT 
has the potential to improve TAU by reducing the lifelong burden of patients 
with recurrent depression. The fact that the effects wear off suggests a 
time-unlimited extension.

As calculated by the meta-analysis of Korn et al., the prognosis of metastatic 
melanoma in the pretarget and immunological therapy era was poor, with a median 
survival of 6.2 and a 1-year life expectancy of 25.5%. Nowadays, significant 
advances in melanoma treatment have been gained, and immunotherapy is one of the 
promising approaches to get to durable responses and survival improvement. The 
aim of the present review is to highlight the recent innovations in melanoma 
immunotherapy and to propose a critical perspective of the future directions of 
this enthralling oncology subspecialty.

Three-Amino-acid-Loop-Extension(TALE) homeodomain transcription factor BLH3 
regulates timing of transition from vegetative to reproductive phase. Previous 
preliminary results obtained using large-scale yeast two-hybrids indicate that 
BLH3 protein possibly interact with Ovate Family Proteins(OFPs) transcription 
co-regulators. Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether OFP1-BLH3 complex is 
involved in regulation of timing of transition from vegetative to reproductive 
phase in Arabidopsis. The interaction between BLH3 and OFP1 was re-tested and 
verified by a yeast two-hybrid system. We found that the BLH3-OFP1 interaction 
was mainly mediated through the BLH3 homeodomain. Meanwhile, this interaction 
was further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) 
inÂ vivo. Further, by establishing protoplast transient expression, we discovered 
that BLH3 acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas OFP1 functioned as a 
repressor. The interactions between OFP1 and BLH3 can reduce BLH3 
transcriptional activity. The ofp1 mutant lines and blh3 mutant lines, OFP1 
overexpress lines and BLH3 overexpress lines can both influence timing of 
transition from vegetative to reproductive phase. Furthermore, 35s:OFP1/blh3 
plants exhibited flowering and leaf quantity similar to that of the wild-type 
controls. 35s:BLH3/ofp1 plants flowered earlier and had less leaves than 
wild-type controls, indicating that OFP1 protein might depend partially on BLH3 
in its function to regulate the timing of transition from vegetative to 
reproductive phase. These results support our assumption that, by interacting 
with OFP1, BLH3 forms a functional protein complex that controls timing of 
progression from vegetative to reproductive phase, and OFP1 might negatively 
regulate BLH3 or the BLH-KNOX complex, an important interaction for sustaining 
the normal transition from vegetative to reproductive phase.

Lifetime data is often right-censored. Recent literature on the Gini index 
estimation with censored data focuses on independent censoring. However, the 
censoring mechanism is likely to be dependent censoring in practice. This paper 
proposes two estimators of the Gini index under independent censoring and 
covariate-dependent censoring, respectively. The proposed estimators are 
consistent and asymptotically normal. We also evaluate the performance of our 
estimators in finite samples through Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the 
proposed methods are applied to real data.

Prevention of childhood obesity is a global priority. The school setting offers 
access to large numbers of children and the ability to provide supportive 
environments for quality physical activity and nutrition. This article describes 
Project Energize, a through-school physical activity and nutrition programme 
that celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2015 so that it might serve as a 
model for similar practices, initiatives and policies elsewhere. The programme 
was envisaged and financed by the Waikato District Health Board of New Zealand 
in 2004 and delivered by Sport Waikato to 124 primary schools as a randomised 
controlled trial from 2005 to 2006. The programme has since expanded to include 
all 242 primary schools in the Waikato region and 70 schools in other regions, 
including 53,000 children. Ongoing evaluation and development of Project 
Energize has shown it to be sustainable (ongoing for >10 years), both effective 
(lower obesity, higher physical fitness) and cost effective (one health related 
cost quality adjusted life year between $18,000 and $30,000) and efficient 
($45/child/year) as a childhood 'health' programme. The programme's unique 
community-based approach is inclusive of all children, serving a population that 
is 42% MÄori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. While the original nine 
healthy eating and seven quality physical activity goals have not changed, the 
delivery and assessment processes has been refined and the health service 
adapted over the 10 years of the programme existence, as well as adapted over 
time to other settings including early childhood education and schools in Cork 
in Ireland. Evaluation and research associated with the programme delivery and 
outcomes are ongoing. The dissemination of findings to politicians and 
collaboration with other service providers are both regarded as priorities.

Some aspects of health status of the Gypsy population in Slovakia.

Bartosovic I.

Population of the Gypsy people living currently in Slovakia reaches 
approximately 400,000 people which represents 7.5% of the total Slovak 
population. The age structure of the Gypsy population is of a considerably 
progressive type with a high number of children and very low number of old 
people. This is due to the high natality and high mortality of Gypsies, whose 
health status is worse than the health status of the majority population. Gypsy 
people represent an important "old-new" risk group in case of tuberculosis and a 
more frequent occurrence of other transmitted diseases is observed in them while 
a higher incidence of genetically conditioned diseases has been confirmed, as 
well. As for children, a higher frequency of infectious diseases, injuries, 
intoxications and burns can be found as a result of their environmental 
conditions. A high level of infant mortality of the Gypsy children is a very 
negative phenomenon. We can state that the lifestyle of the Gypsy population is 
unhealthy, characterized by bad dietary habits, drinking alcohol, frequent 
smoking already in a very young age, higher weight and lower physical activity. 
All findings confirm that the Gypsy population is threatened by cardiovascular 
diseases at younger age already. Due to a more difficult approach to the health 
care, part of the Gypsies consult the physician only when in a serious health 
state. Health status of the Gypsy seniors has been reported only at minimum due 
to their low representation in population. Typical feature of this ethnic is, 
that they take care of their seniors. To prove this, during the authorÂ´s twenty 
seven-year practice he met just three old Gypsy women in social institutions. It 
is very difficult to address problems related to the Gypsy population; this task 
requires engagement of all spheres of our society, in particular of the Gypsies 
themselves, including their organizations (Ref. 50).

Autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD2) are a group of 
genetically heterogeneous diseases that are typically characterised by 
progressive weakness and wasting of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles. Many 
of the more than 20 different conditions show overlapping clinical features with 
other forms of muscular dystrophy, congenital, myofibrillar or even distal 
myopathies and also with acquired muscle diseases. Although individually 
extremely rare, all types of LGMD2 together form an important differential 
diagnostic group among neuromuscular diseases. Despite improved diagnostics and 
pathomechanistic insight, a curative therapy is currently lacking for any of 
these diseases. Medical care consists of the symptomatic treatment of 
complications, aiming to improve life expectancy and quality of life. Besides 
well characterised pre-clinical tools like animal models and cell culture 
assays, the determinants of successful drug development programmes for rare 
diseases include a good understanding of the phenotype and natural history of 
the disease, the existence of clinically relevant outcome measures, guidance on 
care standards, up to date patient registries, and, ideally, biomarkers that can 
help assess disease severity or drug response. Strong patient organisations 
driving research and successful partnerships between academia, advocacy, 
industry and regulatory authorities can also help accelerate the elaboration of 
clinical trials. All these determinants constitute aspects of translational 
research efforts and influence patient access to therapies. Here we review the 
current status of determinants of successful drug development programmes for 
LGMD2, and the challenges of translating promising therapeutic strategies into 
effective and accessible treatments for patients.
