BACKGROUND: Globally, different age groups in the elderly population have 
experienced major shifts over time. Human life expectancy doubled from the 19th 
to the twentieth century and has increased to 80 years in the twenty-first 
century. These conditions imply economic challenges and the increasing 
prevalence of certain health conditions. Old age is associated with increased 
care needs in various aspects of daily life. This study assessed the health care 
needs of elderly patients with lung, liver, and colorectal cancer in Taiwan and 
analyzed the factors underlying their needs.
METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive survey assessed 234 elderly patients 
with diagnosis of lung, liver, and colorectal cancer in Taiwan. We investigated 
their health care needs and daily living functions by using the Supportive Care 
Needs Survey and Karnofsky Performance Status, respectively.
RESULTS: Patients required the most assistance in physical functioning and daily 
living. Patients aged ≥85 years required more care than those aged 65-74 years 
in terms of information access and sexuality needs. Patients with poor 
functional status required more care than those capable of undertaking normal 
activities. Patients diagnosed as having liver cancer required more care than 
those with lung or colorectal cancer. Patients with advanced cancer required 
more physical and daily care than those with early-stage cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients' health care needs differed with age, primary cancer site, 
and functional status. Patients aged ≥85 years and those with poor function, 
primary liver cancer, and advanced cancer had higher care needs.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare and devastating condition 
for which new disease-modifying treatments have recently been approved. Given 
the increasing importance of economic considerations in healthcare 
decision-making, this review summarizes the studies assessing the cost of SMA 
and economic evaluations of treatments. A systematic review of the literature in 
PubMed and Scopus up to 15 September 2020 was conducted according to PRISMA 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Nine studies reporting the annual cost of care of patients with SMA and 
six evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of SMA treatments were identified. The 
average annual cost of SMA1, the most frequent and severe form in which symptoms 
appear before the age of 6 months were similar according to the different 
studies, ranged from $75,047 to $196,429 per year. The yearly costs for the 
forms of the later-onset form, called SMA2, SMA3, and SMA4, which were usually 
pooled in estimates of healthcare costs, were more variable, ranging from 
$27,157 to $82,474. The evaluations of cost-effectiveness of treatment compared 
nusinersen treatment against standard of care (n = 3), two treatments 
(nusinersen and onasemnogene abeparvovec) against each other and no drug 
treatment (n = 1), nusinersen versus onasemnogene abeparvovec (n = 1), and 
standard of care versus nusinersen with and without newborn screening (n = 1). 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of nusinersen compared to 
standard of care in SMA1 ranged from $210,095 to $1,150,455 per quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) gained and that for onasemnogene abeparvovec ranged from 
$32,464 to $251,403. For pre-symptomatic patients, the ICER value ranged from 
$206,409 to $735,519. The ICERs for later-onset forms of SMA (2, 3 and 4) were 
more diverse ranging from $275,943 to $8,438,049.
CONCLUSION: This review confirms the substantial cost burden of standard of care 
for SMA patients and the high cost-effectiveness ratios of the approved drugs at 
the current price when delivered in post-symptomatic patients. Since few studies 
have been conducted so far, there is a need for further prospective and 
independent economic studies in pre- and post-symptomatic patients.

BACKGROUND: The Wee1 (WEE1hu) inhibitor adavosertib and gemcitabine have shown 
preclinical synergy and promising activity in early phase clinical trials. We 
aimed to determine the efficacy of this combination in patients with ovarian 
cancer.
METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, 
women with measurable recurrent platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer were recruited from 11 academic centres in the 
USA and Canada. Women were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, a life expectancy 
of more than 3 months, and normal organ and marrow function. Women with ovarian 
cancer of non-high-grade serous histology were eligible for enrolment in a 
non-randomised exploratory cohort. Eligible participants with high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer were randomly assigned (2:1), using block randomisation (block 
size of three and six) and no stratification, to receive intravenous gemcitabine 
(1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15) with either oral adavosertib (175 mg) or 
identical placebo once daily on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, in 28-day cycles 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients and the team caring 
for each patient were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was 
progression-free survival. The safety and efficacy analysis population comprised 
all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02151292, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 22, 2014, and May 30, 2018, 124 women were enrolled, of 
whom 99 had high-grade serous ovarian cancer and were randomly assigned to 
adavosertib plus gemcitabine (65 [66%]) or placebo plus gemcitabine (34 [34%]). 
25 women with non-high-grade serous ovarian cancer were enrolled in the 
exploratory cohort. After randomisation, five patients with high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer were found to be ineligible (four in the experimental group and 
one in the control group) and did not receive treatment. Median age for all 
treated patients (n=119) was 62 years (IQR 54-67). Progression-free survival was 
longer with adavosertib plus gemcitabine (median 4·6 months [95% CI 3·6-6·4] 
with adavosertib plus gemcitabine vs 3·0 months [1·8-3·8] with placebo plus 
gemcitabine; hazard ratio 0·55 [95% CI 0·35-0·90]; log-rank p=0·015). The most 
frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were haematological (neutropenia in 38 
[62%] of 61 participants in the adavosertib plus gemcitabine group vs ten [30%] 
of 33 in the placebo plus gemcitabine group; thrombocytopenia in 19 [31%] of 61 
in the adavosertib plus gemcitabine group vs two [6%] of 33 in the placebo plus 
gemcitabine group). There were no treatment-related deaths; two patients (one in 
each group in the high-grade serous ovarian cancer cohort) died while on study 
medication (from sepsis in the experimental group and from disease progression 
in the control group).
INTERPRETATION: The observed clinical efficacy of a Wee1 inhibitor combined with 
gemcitabine supports ongoing assessment of DNA damage response drugs in 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer, a TP53-mutated tumour type with high 
replication stress. This therapeutic approach might be applicable to other 
tumour types with high replication stress; larger confirmatory studies are 
required.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The psychometric properties of the EQ-5D-3L (a generic 
preference-based instrument used for calculating quality-adjusted Life -years) 
have not been known for any type of disease in Iran. This study aimed to assess 
its validity and reliability in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: Data of 579 patients were collected from the Diabetes Research Center 
and Clinics in Yazd using EQ-5D-3L, SF-36, and DQoL instruments. The ceiling 
effects were computed for the EQ-5D-3L index and EQ VAS. The construct validity 
was assessed by using convergent validity, discriminant validity, and 
known-groups validity. Reliability was assessed using Cohen's kappa value, 
Cronbach's alpha, and intra-class correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: The ceiling effects of EQ-5D-3L and EQ VAS were 20.18% and 15.33%, 
respectively. The highest degree of correlation was found between the 
pain/discomfort of EQ-5D and the BP scale of the SF-36 (0.55). Higher scores of 
all scales of the DQoL were associated with patients reporting no problems in 
each EQ-5D dimension. The mean of EQ-5D-3L index and EQ VAS scores were 
significantly higher in the male, married, and employed patients, and they did 
not have retinopathy, nephropathy, IHD, hypertension, DFU. The range of kappa 
values was from 0.39 to 0.71, and value of ICC for the EQ-5D-3L index and EQ VAS 
was 0.76 and 0.64, respectively. Cronbach's alpha was 0.87 for EQ-5D-3L and 0.74 
for EQ VAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated good construct validity and moderate to 
good levels of reliability of the EQ-5D-3L for using in the patients with 
diabetes, and it can be used in research or clinical practice in Iran and other 
regions of the Middle East.

In-person models of genetic counseling (GC) have been the common method in Japan 
for pregnant women to receive GC. However, recent increases in the number of 
pregnant women considering undergoing prenatal testing have made it challenging 
to retain individualized in-person care. To explore pregnant women's opinions 
toward pretest GC models and the ideal time duration, a self-administered 
questionnaire survey was conducted for women at their first prenatal visit. A 
total of 114 valid respondents (93.4%) were included in the analyses. Of these, 
80.7% of women preferred in-person GC, followed by classroom (9.6%), group 
(3.5%), and telegenetic-based GC (2.6%). Women with experience in undergoing 
prenatal testing significantly did not prefer in-person GC (p = 0.05). Sixty-two 
women (54.4%) preferred a duration of 15-29 min for pretest GC sessions, 
followed by 30-59 min (28.9%) and <15 min (14.9%). Women's preference of ≥30 min 
in length was significantly associated with anhedonia, singleton pregnancies, 
acquaintance with people with trisomy 21, and awareness of prenatal testing. 
Women who were unaware of the need for agreement with the partner for prenatal 
testing and who did not know the average life expectancy of a trisomy 21 patient 
significantly preferred <15 min in length over other durations. While the 
majority of women preferred in-person GC for <30 min, their preferences varied 
by their background characteristics, experiences, attitudes, and knowledge. 
These findings will help establish a prenatal GC system offering a choice of GC 
models in Japan; however, further large-scale studies are needed to confirm 
these findings.

of Yuyao, Ningbo, China.

BACKGROUND: No detailed quantitative global, regional, or national estimates of 
the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
are available.
METHODS: We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to estimate the global, regional, and national 
incidence rates and DALYs of T2DM, as well as the associated risk factors, in 
all 194 countries and territories by age, sex, and sociodemographic status 
during the period from 2007 to 2017.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized incidence and DALY rates increased by 
3.23% and 5.07% during 2007 to 2017, respectively. The age-standardized 
incidence and DALY rates in 2017 and the corresponding percentage changes during 
2007 to 2017 were highest in the low-middle sociodemographic index (SDI) 
quintile. Regionally, the highest 2017 age-standardized incidence and DALY rates 
were observed in Oceania, whereas the largest percentage increases in both rates 
during 2007 to 2017 were observed in Southeast Asia. Nationally, Iran, the 
United Kingdom, and Indonesia reported the largest percentage increases in the 
age-standardized incidence rates, whereas Georgia, Czech Republic, and Iran 
showed the largest percentage increases in the age-standardized DALY rates. 
Globally, the largest percentage increases in risk-attributable DALYs were 
associated with a high body mass index, low physical activity level, high 
fasting plasma glucose level, and high sugar-sweetened beverage and red meat 
consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The global T2DM age-standardized incidence and DALY rates increased 
globally between 2007 and 2017, especially in the low-middle SDI quintile, 
Southeast Asia.

3.23% 和 5.07%。 2017 年的年龄标准化发病率和 DALY 率以及 2007 年至 2017 
年期间的相应百分比变化在中低收入国家中最高。从区域来看, 2017 年年龄标准化发病率和 DALY 率最高的是大洋洲, 而 2007 年至 2017 年期间, 
东南亚的百分比增幅最大。在全国范围内, 伊朗、英国和印度尼西亚的年龄标准化发病率百分比增幅最大, 而格鲁吉亚、捷克共和国和伊朗的年龄标准化 DALY 
比率增幅最大。在全球范围内, 可归因于风险的 DALY 的最大百分比增加与高体重指数、低体力活动水平、高空腹血糖水平以及高含糖饮料和红肉消费相关。 结论: 
2007 年至 2017 年间, T2DM 年龄标准化发病率和 DALY 率在全球范围内增加, 尤其是在东南亚中低收入国家。.

INTRODUCTION: Region-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores or 
utility values are representative and pivotal for economic evaluations as they 
are influenced by the value judgment of the local population. This study 
systematically reviewed and pooled EuroQoL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) utility scores of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) across primary studies from Asia.
METHODS: Studies reporting EQ-5D utility scores among adult RA patients from 
Asian countries were systematically searched in PubMed-Medline, Scopus and 
Embase since inception through February 2020. Selected studies were 
systematically reviewed and study quality assessment was performed. 
Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model with subgroup and 
meta-regression analysis to explore heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Among 1391 searched articles, 37 studies with 31 983 participants were 
systematically reviewed and meta-analysis was conducted among 31 studies. The 
pooled EQ-5D scores and EQ-5D visual analog score were 0.66 (95% CI 0.63-0.69, 
I2  = 99.65%) and 61.21 (50.73-71.69, I2  = 99.56%) respectively with high 
heterogeneity. For RA patients with no, low, moderate and high disease activity 
based on Disease Activity Score (DAS)-28, the pooled EQ-5D scores were 0.78 
(0.65-0.90), 0.73 (0.65-0.80), 0.53 (0.32- 0.74), and 0.47 (0.32-0.62), 
respectively. On meta-regression, age of patients (P < .05) was positively 
associated and use of glucocorticoids (P < .05) was inversely associated with 
utility values.
CONCLUSION: Lower EQ-5D scores were associated with severe disease activity, 
increasing age and female gender among RA patients. The study provides pooled 
EQ-5D scores for RA patients that are useful inputs for cost-utility studies in 
Asia.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of pH on the lipid oxidation 
of red onion skin extracts (ROSEs) treated with washed tilapia muscle model 
systems (WTMS). Minced and buffered washed samples were prepared at pH 6.3 and 
6.8. The WTMS were treated with2 different concentrations of red onion skin 
prior to storage for 5 days. Lipid oxidation was investigated via peroxide 
values (PVs), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and the formation 
of volatile compounds. Fatty acid profiles of the samples were also identified. 
The ROSEs were able to significantly suppress the PV (~71%) and TBARS (~42%) 
formation. Hexanal and octanal formations in the WTMS were relatively less in 
the ROSE-treated samples. The WTMS samples prepared at pH 6.3 were more 
vulnerable to lipid oxidation than those prepared at pH 6.8. Red onion skin 
polyphenols may increase the lag phase of lipid oxidation, depending on pH 
levels, resulting in the shelf life extension of raw fish.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals announced by the United Nations are 
important guides for the development processes of developing countries. However, 
achieving all of these goals is only possible if the goals are consistent with 
each other. It has been observed in the literature that possible contradictions 
between these goals are ignored. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to 
investigate whether two sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the UN are 
contradictory or supporting each other in low-income countries. These SDGs are 
"Good Health and Well-Being" (SDG3) and "Partnerships for the Goals" (SDG17). 
For this purpose, the role of globalization and democracy in life expectancy is 
empirically investigated in 16 low-income countries over the period 1970-2017. 
While globalization has been used as an indicator of the partnership between 
countries, democracy has been used as an indicator of accountability and 
cooperation between governments and societies. According to estimations of the 
continuous-updated fully modified (CUP-FM) and bias-adjusted ordinary least 
squares (BA-OLS), globalization and its subcomponents such as economic, social, 
and political globalization affect life expectancy positively. Democracy also 
increases life expectancy in those countries. The GDP per capita is also used as 
a control variable. Our results show that a higher level of per capita income is 
positively associated with higher levels of life expectancy. In conclusion, no 
contradiction was found between SDG3 and SDG17 in those countries. Achieving a 
healthier society requires economic, social, and political integration between 
governments and societies.

Rectus Sheath Hematoma: A Rare Surgical Emergency.

A rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is a rare medical condition that consists of 
blood accumulating in the rectus abdominis muscle sheath. RSH is most frequently 
due to a hemorrhage from the superior or inferior epigastric artery. RSH has 
many specific risk factors, such as anticoagulant use. As the use of 
anticoagulants increases, the incidence of RSH has also increased. This 
condition can present with the infrequent complication of abdominal compartment 
syndrome (ACS), which can require surgical decompression of the abdomen to avoid 
high morbidity and mortality. We present the case of a 79-year-old male who, 
after receiving anticoagulants, developed a right-sided RSH which progressed to 
ACS. The patient was transferred to our care for community-acquired pneumonia, 
pneumothorax, and increasing respiratory support. He was admitted to the medical 
intensive care unit (MICU), was placed on a nasal cannula, and given vancomycin 
and Zosyn for pneumonia. After two days, the patient was switched to enoxaparin 
for anticoagulation. After three days, the patient's pneumothorax had resolved. 
At this time, the patient reported swelling in his right lower quadrant (RLQ) 
with mild pain, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty voiding completely. The 
physical examination confirmed RLQ swelling, and a kidney, ureter, and bladder 
(KUB) x-ray and ultrasound were ordered. A CT with and without contrast was also 
obtained which showed a large right rectus sheath hematoma extension into 
preperitoneal space and a small amount of intraperitoneal fluid along the right 
paracolic gutter. Soon after, the patient became lightheaded and fell after 
using the restroom. Vitals at the time were a blood pressure of 79/56, heart 
rate (HR) of 127, and oxygen saturation of 88% with his hemoglobin dropping from 
11.4 g/dL earlier that morning to 8.4 g/dL. The patient's care was transferred 
to our surgical team in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). He received an 
arterial line, two doses of protamine, 1-liter of crystalloids, and two units of 
packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's vitals normalized. Interventional 
radiology (IR) was consulted but they requested the coagulopathy be corrected 
before any intervention. Reversal of his Lovenox® was thromboelastographic 
(TEG)-guided and included platelets, cryoprecipitate, and prothrombin complex 
concentrate/fresh frozen plasma (PCC/FFP), in addition to more PRBCs. During 
these interventions, the patient acutely decompensated with hypotension, 
difficulty breathing, and expansion of his hematoma. A bladder pressure in the 
30s was obtained, causing him to be sent to the operating room (OR) for 
decompression, extraperitoneal packing, and the wound was temporarily closed. 
The patient returned and IR was able to embolize the right inferior epigastric 
artery. The patient was taken to the OR again for exploration, removal of 
packing, and closure. RSH is a rare complication that can occur due to trauma, 
coagulopathy, obesity, and muscle strains during a pregnancy. Larger hematomas 
tend to occur below the arcuate line because there is an absence of the 
posterior rectus sheath which enables the hematomas to spread. An RSH can be 
treated with conservative measures, but for patients who continue to bleed, more 
aggressive measures should be taken to avoid life-threatening complications, 
such as ACS.

OBJECTIVE: Joint contractures are a major complication following joint 
immobilization. However, no fully effective treatment has yet been found. 
Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2) therapy was developed and verified this 
therapeutic application in various disorders. We aimed to verify the efficacy of 
transcutaneous CO2 therapy for immobilization-induced joint contracture.
METHOD: Twenty-two Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three groups: caged 
control, those untreated after joint immobilization, and those treated after 
joint immobilization. The rats were treated with CO2 for 20 min once a daily 
either during immobilization, (prevention) or during remobilization after 
immobilization (treatment). Knee extension motion was measured with a 
goniometer, and the muscular and articular factors responsible for contractures 
were calculated. We evaluated muscle fibrosis, fibrosis-related genes (collagen 
Type 1α1 and TGF-β1) in muscles, synovial intima's length, and fibrosis-related 
proteins (Type I collagen and TGF-β1) in the joint capsules.
RESULTS: CO2 therapy for prevention and treatment improved the knee extension 
motion. Muscular and articular factors decreased in rats of the treatment group. 
The muscular fibrosis of treated rats decreased in the treatment group. Although 
CO2 therapy did not repress the increased expression of collagen Type 1α1, the 
therapy decreased the expression of TGF-β1 in the treatment group. CO2 therapy 
for treatment improved the shortening of the synovial membrane after 
immobilization and decreased the immunolabeling of TGF-β1 in the joint capsules.
CONCLUSIONS: CO2 therapy may prevent and treat contractures after joint 
immobilization, and appears to be more effective as a treatment strategy for the 
deterioration of contractures during remobilization.

Structural Roles for the Juxtamembrane Linker Region and Transmembrane Region of 
Synaptobrevin 2 in Membrane Fusion.

Formation of the trans-SNARE complex is believed to generate a force transfer to 
the membranes to promote membrane fusion, but the underlying mechanism remains 
elusive. In this study, we show that helix-breaking and/or length-increasing 
insertions in the juxtamembrane linker region of synaptobrevin-2 exert diverse 
effects on liposome fusion, in a manner dependent on the insertion position 
relative to the two conserved tryptophan residues (W89/W90). Helical extension 
of synaptobrevin-2 to W89/W90 is a prerequisite for initiating membrane merger. 
The transmembrane region of synaptobrevin-2 enables proper localization of 
W89/W90 at the membrane interface to gate force transfer. Besides, our data 
indicate that the SNARE regulatory components Munc18-1 and Munc13-1 impose 
liposome fusion strong demand on tight coupling between the SNARE motif and the 
transmembrane region of synaptobrevin-2.

Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is a common debilitating condition arising from 
head injury and is highly prevalent among military service members and veterans 
with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Diagnosis and treatment for PTH is still 
evolving, and surprisingly little is known about the putative mechanisms that 
drive these headaches. This manuscript describes the design of a randomized 
clinical trial of two nonpharmacological (i.e., behavioral) interventions for 
posttraumatic headache. Design of this trial required careful consideration of 
PTH diagnosis and inclusion criteria, which was challenging due to the lack of 
standard clinical characteristics in PTH unique from other types of headaches. 
The treatments under study differed in clinical focus and dose (i.e., number of 
treatment sessions), but the trial was designed to balance the treatments as 
well as possible. Finally, while the primary endpoints for pain research can 
vary from assessments of pain intensity to objective and subjective functional 
measures, this trial of PTH interventions chose carefully to establish 
clinically relevant endpoints and to maximize the opportunity to detect 
significant differences between groups with two primary outcomes. All these 
issues are discussed in this manuscript.

BACKGROUND: Spinal surgery has to address the challenge of a dramatic increase 
of the growing number of older persons. The purpose of the present study was to 
project the numbers of surgically treated degenerative spine disease (DSD) in 
Austria from 2017 until 2080 to provide potential future scenarios that the 
Austrian Health system might have to face.
METHODS: Current numbers on demographic information from Austria as well as 
population projections for 2017-2080 were obtained from Statistics Austria 
(STAT). A lower/main/upper scenario reflecting low/main/high growth and ageing 
scenarios deducted from fertility, life expectancy and immigration calculations 
was used. Information on prevalence of surgically treated DSD was obtained from 
the Austrian Spine Register.
RESULTS: The population in Austria (evaluated in 2017) was 8.78 millions and is 
estimated to evolve to 7.86/10.0/13.1 millions by 2080. The total number of 
surgically treated DSD recorded in the Spine Register was 9300 and was estimated 
to be 9300/11200/13700 in 2080. The number of subjects with surgically treated 
DSD were expected to increase in the age-strata (main scenario), 100% 
corresponds to the number in each age and gender stratum: 0-40 years by 
(male/female) 2%/2%, 40-50 years -7%/-7%, 50-59 years -11%/-9%, 60-69 years 
21%/16%, 70-79 years 51%/31%, 80-89 years 211%/129% and 90+years 698%/411%.
CONCLUSIONS: Total numbers of subjects with DSD in Austria will increase from 
2017 to 2080. The increase will be substantial in those aged 80+ and those aged 
90+. The assumptions of this analysis were taken conservatively. Hence, the 
future socio-economic burden to society might be greater as projected by the 
study.

On the role of cost-effectiveness thresholds in healthcare priority setting.

Caring Sciences, Linköping University, LinköpingSE-581 83, Sweden.

In the past few years, empirical estimates of the marginal cost at which health 
care produces a quality-adjusted life year (QALY, k) have begun to emerge. In 
theory, these estimates could be used as cost-effectiveness thresholds by 
health-maximizing decision makers, but prioritization decisions in practice 
often include other considerations than just efficiency. Pharmaceutical 
reimbursement in Sweden is one such example, where the reimbursement authority 
(TLV) uses a threshold range to give priority to disease severity and rarity. In 
this paper, we argue that estimates of k should not be used to inform threshold 
ranges. Instead, they are better used directly in health technology assessment 
(HTA) to quantify how much health is forgone when a new technology is funded in 
place of other healthcare services. Using a recent decision made by TLV as a 
case, we show that an estimate of k for Sweden implies that reimbursement meant 
forgoing 8.6 QALYs for every QALY that was gained. Reporting cost-effectiveness 
evidence as QALYs forgone per QALY gained has several advantages: (i) it frames 
the decision as assigning an equity weight to QALYs gained, which is more 
transparent about the trade-off between equity and efficiency than determining a 
monetary cost per QALY threshold, (ii) it makes it less likely that decision 
makers neglect taking the opportunity cost of reimbursement into account by 
making it explicit, and (iii) it helps communicate the reason for sometimes 
denying reimbursement in a way that might be less objectionable to the public 
than current practice.

BACKGROUND: Studies suggest lower risk of breast cancer in women with HIV versus 
without HIV. These estimates may be biased by lower life expectancy and younger 
age distribution of women with HIV. Our analysis evaluated this bias and 
characterized secular trends in breast cancer among women with HIV initiating 
antiretroviral therapy. We hypothesized breast cancer risk would increase over 
time as mortality decreased.
SETTING: Women with HIV prescribed antiretroviral therapy in the North American 
AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD) from 1997 through 
2016.
METHODS: We estimated breast cancer hazard (cause-specific hazard ratios) and 
cumulative incidence accounting for competing risks (subdistribution hazard 
ratios) to assess changes in breast cancer risk over time. This was assessed 
overall (1997-2016) and within/across calendar periods. Analyses were adjusted 
for race/ethnicity and inverse probability weighted for cohort. Cumulative 
incidence was graphically assessed by calendar period and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: We observed 11,587 women during 1997-2016, contributing 63 incident 
breast cancer diagnoses and 1,353 deaths [73,445 person-years (median follow-up 
= 4.5 years)]. Breast cancer cumulative incidence was 3.2% for 1997-2016. We 
observed no secular trends in breast cancer hazard or cumulative incidence. 
There were annual declines in the hazard and cumulative incidence of death 
(cause-specific hazard ratios and subdistribution hazard ratios: 0.89, 95% 
confidence interval: 0.87 to 0.91) which remained within and across calendar 
periods.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings contradict the hypothesis of increasing breast 
cancer risk with declining mortality over time among women with HIV, suggesting 
limited impact of changing mortality on breast cancer risk. Additional inquiry 
is merited as survival improves among women with HIV.

OBJECTIVES: Improvement of life expectancy is increasingly important with the 
aging of society. The aim of the study was to compare physical performance in 
elderly people in two 3-year periods (2001-2003) and (2016-2018).
METHODS: The participants were healthy Japanese elderly adults who attended 
public health check-ups in Yakumo. Results for 10 m gait time, two-step test, 
back muscle strength, and grip strength were examined prospectively for 
participants in 2001-2003 (Group A: n = 488) and 2016-2018 (Group B: n = 309) by 
gender and age (65-74 and 75-84 years).
RESULTS: There were significant differences between Groups A and B for 10 m gait 
time (age 65-74: male: 5.6 vs. 5.2 s, female: 6.3 vs. 5.5 s; age 75-84: male: 
6.1 vs. 5.5 s, female: 6.7 vs. 5.8 s; all p < .05) and two-step test (age 65-74: 
male: 1.41 vs. 1.48, female: 1.35 vs. 1.44; age 75-84: male: 1.32 vs. 1.41, 
female: 1.30 vs. 1.38; all p < .05), but not for back muscle strength or grip 
strength.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a phenomenon of 'overcoming locomotive 
syndrome', in which physical performance changed by aging, including motor 
functions such as 10 m gait time and two-step test, has improved in the current 
population compared with a similar population from 15 years ago.

BACKGROUND: Serious games are being used to train specific technical skills in 
medicine, and most research has been done for surgical skills. It is not known 
if these games improve technical skills in real life as most games have not been 
completely validated.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to evaluate the current use of serious 
games for improving technical skills in medicine and to determine their current 
validation state using a validation framework specifically designed for serious 
games.
METHODS: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A 
multidatabase search strategy was adopted, after which a total of 17 
publications were included in this review.
RESULTS: These 17 publications described five different serious games for 
improving technical skills. We discuss these games in detail and report about 
their current validation status. Only one game was almost fully validated. We 
also discuss the different frameworks that can be used for validation of serious 
games.
CONCLUSIONS: Serious games are not extensively used for improving technical 
skills in medicine, although they may represent an attractive alternative way of 
learning. The validation of these games is mostly incomplete. Additionally, 
several frameworks for validation exist, but it is unknown which one is the 
best. This review may assist game developers or educators in validating serious 
games.
