Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to elucidate the trends and characteristics of the 
cancer burden in Korea by cancer site, region, and income level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Korean National Burden of Disease research methodology 
was applied to measure the cancer burden in Korea from 2008 to 2018. The cause 
of death and national health insurance claims data were obtained from Statistics 
Korea and the National Health Insurance Service, respectively. An 
incidence-based approach was applied to calculate the disability-adjusted 
life-years, which is a summary measure of population health.
RESULTS: In the past decade, the cancer burden in Korea increased from 2,088 to 
2,457 person-years per 100,000 population. Among the cancer burden, the years of 
life lost decreased, and the years lived with disabilities increased. Cancers of 
the trachea, bronchus, and lung had the highest disease burden, followed by 
those of the stomach, colon and rectum, liver, and breast.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study can provide valuable quantitative data 
for prioritizing and evaluating cancer prevention strategies and implementing 
cancer policies. Estimating the difference in cancer burden according to region 
and income level within a country can yield useful data to understand the nature 
of the cancer burden and scale of the problem. In addition, the results of this 
study provide a better understanding of the causes of cancer patterns, thereby 
generating new hypotheses regarding its pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: People with dementia die prematurely. Identifying differences in 
mortality rates between different types of dementia might aid in the development 
of preventive interventions for the most vulnerable populations. The aim of this 
study was to compare the difference in mortality rates between individuals 
without dementia and individuals with various types of dementia.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we did a systematic 
search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to July 
11, 2020, for cross-sectional or cohort studies that assessed mortality and 
survival-related outcomes among people with different types of dementia compared 
with people without dementia. Single-arm studies without comparison groups and 
autopsy studies or family studies that used a selected sample were excluded. The 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used by two authors (D-JL and C-SC) independently to 
measure the methodological quality of included studies, and two authors (F-CY 
and P-TT) independently extracted data. We assessed differences in all-cause 
mortality rate and survival time from dementia diagnosis between individuals 
without dementia, individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with 
non-Alzheimer's disease dementias. The secondary outcomes were age at death and 
survival time from disease onset. Random-effects meta-analyses were done. Effect 
sizes included hazard ratios (HRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. 
Potential moderators, including age-associated moderators, were identified 
through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. This study is registered with 
PROSPERO, CRD42020198786.
FINDINGS: Our database search identified 11 973 records, and we included 78 
eligible studies in our analyses, encompassing 63 125 individuals with dementia 
and 152 353 controls. Individuals with any type of dementia had a higher 
mortality rate than individuals without dementia (HR 5·90, 95% CI 3·53 to 9·86), 
and the HR for all-cause mortality was highest for Lewy body dementia (17·88, 
5·87 to 54·46). After diagnosis, the mean survival time for people with 
Alzheimer's disease was 5·8 years (SD 2·0). Compared with people with 
Alzheimer's disease, a diagnosis of any non-Alzheimer's disease dementia was 
associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1·33, 1·21 to 1·46), a 
shorter survival time from diagnosis (MD -1·12 years, 95% CI -1·52 to -0·72), 
and a younger age at death (-1·76 years, -2·66 to -0·85). Survival time from 
disease onset was also shorter in people with non-Alzheimer's dementia, across 
types, compared with people with Alzheimer's disease, but the subgroup analysis 
revealed that this difference was only significant for vascular dementia (MD 
-1·27 years, -1·90 to -0·65) and dementia with Lewy bodies (MD -1·06 years, 
-1·68 to -0·44). The interactions between age and several survival-related 
outcomes were significant. 39 (50%) of the 78 included studies were rated as 
good quality, and large heterogeneity (I2>75%) was observed for most of the 
study outcomes.
INTERPRETATION: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia and one 
of the major causes of mortality worldwide. However, the findings from the 
current study suggest that non-Alzheimer's disease dementias were associated 
with higher morality rates and shorter life expectancy than Alzheimer's disease. 
Developing tailored treatment and rehabilitation programmes for different types 
of dementia is important for mental health providers, patients, and their 
families.

BACKGROUND: In response to population ageing, most countries within the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are planning 
increases to their pension age. To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, 
scholars have advocated for continued monitoring of healthy working-life 
expectancy. However, estimates are limited to a few countries during limited 
periods of time. Our study aims to estimate healthy and unhealthy working-life 
expectancy in 14 OECD countries at three points in time between 2002 and 2017.
METHODS: In this population-based study, we used cross-sectional data from 
nationally representative surveys on ageing that were representative of the 
population aged 51-65 years in England, the USA, and 11 European countries plus 
Israel. European countries, except for England, and Israel were divided into two 
groups according to their score on the Active Ageing Index (AAI). We estimated 
healthy and unhealthy working-life expectancy, defined as the number of years 
spent working in good or in poor health. Poor health was defined as the presence 
of at least one chronic disease. Sullivan's method was used to estimate 
expectancies.
FINDINGS: Among men, healthy working-life expectancy increased in low-AAI 
countries (4·15 in 2002, 95% CI 4·01-4·30; vs 4·73 in 2017, 4·58-4·87; 
p<0·0001), but decreased in the USA (3·68 in 2002, 3·47-3·89; vs 3·21 in 2017, 
3·03-3·38; p<0·0001). Among women, healthy working-life expectancy increased in 
England (3·55 in 2002, 3·39-3·71; vs 4·47 in 2017, 4·14-4·81; p<0·0001), 
high-AAI countries (4·16 in 2002, 4·02-4·30; vs 4·80 in 2017, 4·65-4·96; 
p<0·0001), and low-AAI countries (2·41 in 2002, 2·30-2·52; vs 4·00 in 2017, 
3·88-4·12; p<0·0001). Unhealthy working life expectancy increased among men and 
women in all countries. In all countries, the greatest number of years spent 
unhealthy and working was among men and women with hypertension or arthritis.
INTERPRETATION: Across countries, increases in the total number of years spent 
working were systematically accompanied by increases in the number of years 
spent working with a chronic disease. The burden of chronic diseases will 
probably continue to increase among older workers as countries plan to further 
increase their pension ages, but prevention of hypertension and arthritis could 
mitigate this trend.

BACKGROUND: Integrating primary prevention into care pathways for older adults 
is a core strategy of healthy ageing, but evidence remains limited. We aimed to 
determine whether incorporating a multidomain intervention into primary health 
care could improve standard value-based health outcomes and quality of life.
METHODS: For this Taiwan Integrated Geriatric Care (TIGER) study, a pragmatic 
randomised controlled trial, we recruited community-dwelling outpatients aged 65 
years or older with at least three chronic medical conditions. We excluded 
people with malignancies undergoing chemotherapy, people with a life expectancy 
of less than 12 months, or people who were insufficiently able to communicate 
with study staff. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to usual care or to 
the integrated multidomain intervention using block randomisation. The 
integrated multidomain intervention entailed 16 2-h sessions per year, 
comprising communal physical exercise, cognitive training, nutrition and disease 
education, plus individualised treatment by specialists in integrated geriatric 
care. The primary outcome was changes from baseline quality of life, based on 
36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. 
Intervention effects were analysed per protocol using a generalised linear mixed 
model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03528005.
FINDINGS: Between June 25, 2018, and Feb 15, 2019, 628 participants were 
screened, of whom 398 were assigned to the integrated multidomain intervention 
(n=199) or to usual care (n=199). 335 (84%) participants completed the 12-month 
follow-up. Compared with the usual care group, the integrated multidomain 
intervention group had significantly higher mean SF-36 physical component scores 
across all timepoints (overall difference 0·8, 95% CI 0·2-1·5; p=0·010), but 
differences at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months did not reach statistical significance. 
The SF-36 mental component scores did not differ significantly overall, but were 
significantly higher in the integrated multidomain intervention group at the 
12-month follow-up (55·3 [SD 7·6] vs 57·2 [7·0]; p=0·019). No serious adverse 
events occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Incorporating multidomain interventions into integrated health 
care improved quality of life. Our standardised protocol is amenable to 
inclusion in policies to promote value-based care and healthy ageing.

The longevity society.

Research, London, UK. Electronic address: ascott@london.edu.

As the demographic transition enters a new stage of a longevity transition, 
focus needs to extend beyond an ageing society towards a longevity society. An 
ageing society focuses on changes in the age structure of the population, 
whereas a longevity society seeks to exploit the advantages of longer lives 
through changes in how we age. Achieving a longevity society requires 
substantial changes in the life course and social norms, and involves an 
epidemiological transition towards a focus on delaying the negative effects of 
ageing. The broad changes required to achieve healthy longevity include an 
increased focus on healthy life expectancy, a shift from intervention towards 
preventive health, a major public health agenda to avoid increases in health 
inequality, the establishment of longevity councils to ensure coordinated policy 
across government departments, and intergenerational assessment of policies, to 
ensure that in adapting to longer lives, policies are not skewed towards older 
people. A longevity society represents a new stage for humanity and requires 
deep-seated notions about age and ageing to be challenged if society is to make 
the best use of the additional time that longevity brings.

The longevity economy.

Research, London, UK. Electronic address: ascott@london.edu.

The fact that people are on average living healthier, longer lives than 
previously has the potential to be positive for the economy, offsetting the 
negative economic effects of an ageing society. A longevity economy will see a 
shift in the mix of sectors in the economy, with both health and education 
expanding further and new financial products arising. Such an economy has the 
potential to contribute to growth in gross domestic product through employment 
and human capital. Shifting to a longevity economy requires less reliance on 
policies stated purely in terms of age, and more extension of existing policies 
aimed at diverse needs and circumstances to older age groups. This shift will be 
needed to counter inequality within age groups. A life course perspective is 
also required, to ensure a focus on intergenerational equity and a better 
understanding of the needs of older individuals that are not health driven.

BACKGROUND: Gender differences in life expectancy and societal roles have 
implications for a country's capacity to support its older population. 
Specifically, the longevity risk associated with longer life expectancy of 
women, with greater risk of morbidity entails different needs between genders in 
older age. We aimed to quantify gender differences in the ageing experience of 
older people in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
countries as a first step in identifying policy gaps and differences in the 
allocation of resources and social support for older men and women.
METHODS: We constructed a multidimensional Ageing Index to account for gender 
differences in societal ageing, using mostly gender-disaggregated latest 
available data between 2015 and 2019, for 18 OECD countries. Our Ageing Index is 
a weighted sum of scores for five domains, which consisted of various measures, 
that are important for societal ageing: wellbeing, productivity and engagement, 
equity, security, and cohesion. The construction of the domains and their 
relative weighting was determined by the Research Network on an Ageing Society, 
an interdisciplinary group of academics. We computed the overall index and 
domain scores (from 0 to 100) for each gender and compared these scores between 
genders and countries.
FINDINGS: In every country, gender differences in key domains of societal ageing 
favour men. Countries in northern Europe (ie, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and 
Norway), the Netherlands, and Japan had high overall Index scores for both 
genders, whereas many eastern and southern European countries (eg, Hungary, 
Poland, and Slovenia) performed less well. Countries with the largest gender 
difference in Index scores include the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy, whereas 
Ireland, Spain, and Poland had the smallest difference. Gender differences were 
present for the domains of productivity and engagement, security, and cohesion. 
Gender differences favoured men for domain productivity and engagement (mean 
10·2, 95% CI 7·8-12·6; p<0·0001), security (10·3, 7·8-12·7; p<0·0001), and 
cohesion (21·1, 13·9-28·1; p<0·0001). Although the domains of wellbeing and 
equity showed more mixed results, they nonetheless showed a slight advantage for 
men.
INTERPRETATION: Our multidimensional index helps to identify specific gender 
differences along key domains of societal ageing in various OECD countries. 
Furthermore, the inter-country comparisons reveal those countries with more 
successful societal ageing, which could be instructive for policy makers.

PURPOSE: Physiologically, people age at different rates, which leads to a 
discrepancy between physiological and chronological age. Physiological age 
should be a priority when considering the indications for adult spinal deformity 
(ASD) surgery. The primary objective of this study was to determine the 
characteristics of the postoperative course, surgical outcomes, and complication 
rates to extend the healthy life expectancy of older ASD patients (≥ 75 years). 
The secondary objective was to clarify the importance of physiological age in 
the surgical treatment of older ASD patients, considering frailty.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 109 consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 years with 
symptomatic ASD who underwent a corrective long fusion with lateral interbody 
fusion from the lower thoracic spine to the pelvis from 2015 to 2019 was 
conducted. Patients were classified into two groups according to age (group Y 
[65-74 years], group O [≥ 75 years]) and further divided into four groups 
according to the ASD-frailty index score (Y-F, Y-NF, O-F, and O-NF groups). To 
account for potential risk factors for perioperative course characteristics, 
complication rates, and surgical outcomes, patients from the database were 
subjected to propensity score matching based on sex, BMI, and preoperative 
sagittal spinal alignment (C7 sagittal vertical axis, pelvic incidence-lumbar 
lordosis, and pelvic tilt). Clinical outcomes were evaluated 2 years 
postoperatively, using three patient-reported outcome measures of health-related 
quality of life: the Oswestry Disability Index, Scoliosis Research Society 
questionnaire (SRS-22), and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Additionally, the 
postoperative time-to-first ambulation, as well as minor, major, and mechanical 
complications, were evaluated.
RESULTS: In the comparison between Y and O groups, patients in group O were at a 
higher risk of minor complications (delirium and urinary tract infection). In 
contrast, other surgical outcomes of group O were comparable to those of group 
Y, except for SRS-22 (satisfaction) and time to ambulation after surgery, with 
better outcomes in Group O. Patients in the O-NF group had better postoperative 
outcomes (time to ambulation after surgery, SRS-22 (function, self-image, 
satisfaction), SF-36 [PCS]) than those in the Y-F group.
CONCLUSIONS: Older age warrants monitoring of minor complications in the 
postoperative management of patients. However, the outcomes of ASD surgery 
depended more on frailty than on chronological age. Older ASD patients without 
frailty might tolerate corrective surgery and have satisfactory outcomes when 
minimally invasive techniques are used. Physiological age is more important than 
chronological age when determining the indications for surgery in older patients 
with ASD.

IMPORTANCE: Quantitative assessment of disease progression in patients with 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been systematically examined 
using competing liver-related and non-liver-related mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate long-term outcomes in NAFLD, accounting for competing 
liver-related and non-liver-related mortality associated with the different 
fibrosis stages of NAFLD using a simulated patient population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical modeling study used 
individual-level state-transition simulation analysis and was conducted from 
September 1, 2017, to September 1, 2021. A publicly available interactive tool, 
dubbed NAFLD Simulator, was developed that simulates the natural history of 
NAFLD by age and fibrosis stage at the time of (hypothetical) diagnosis defined 
by liver biopsy. Model health states were defined by fibrosis states F0 to F4, 
decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver transplant. 
Simulated patients could experience nonalcoholic steatohepatitis resolution, and 
their fibrosis stage could progress or regress. Transition probabilities between 
states were estimated from the literature as well as calibration, and the model 
reproduced the outcomes of a large observational study.
EXPOSURE: Simulated natural history of NAFLD.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were life expectancy; all cause, 
liver-related, and non-liver-related mortality; and cumulative incidence of 
decompensated cirrhosis and/or HCC.
RESULTS: The model included 1 000 000 simulated patients with a mean (range) age 
of 49 (18-75) years at baseline, including 66% women. The life expectancy of 
patients aged 49 years was 25.3 (95% CI, 20.1-29.8) years for those with F0, 
25.1 (95% CI, 20.1-29.4) years for those with F1, 23.6 (95% CI, 18.3-28.2) years 
for those with F2, 21.1 (95% CI, 15.6-26.3) years for those with F3, and 13.8 
(95% CI, 10.3-17.6) years for those with F4 at the time of diagnosis. The 
estimated 10-year liver-related mortality was 0.1% (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI], <0.1%-0.2%) in F0, 0.2% (95% UI, 0.1%-0.4%) in F1, 1.0% (95% UI, 
0.6%-1.7%) in F2, 4.0% (95% UI, 2.5%-5.9%) in F3, and 29.3% (95% UI, 
21.8%-35.9%) in F4. The corresponding 10-year non-liver-related mortality was 
1.8% (95% UI, 0.6%-5.0%) in F0, 2.4% (95% UI, 0.8%-6.3%) in F1, 5.2% (95% UI, 
2.0%-11.9%) in F2, 9.7% (95% UI, 4.3%-18.1%) in F3, and 15.6% (95% UI, 
10.1%-21.7%) in F4. Among patients aged 65 years, estimated 10-year 
non-liver-related mortality was higher than liver-related mortality in all 
fibrosis stages (eg, F2: 16.7% vs 0.8%; F3: 28.8% vs 3.0%; F4: 40.8% vs 21.9%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This decision analytic model study simulated 
stage-specific long-term outcomes, including liver- and non-liver-related 
mortality in patients with NAFLD. Depending on age and fibrosis stage, 
non-liver-related mortality was higher than liver-related mortality in patients 
with NAFLD. By translating surrogate markers into clinical outcomes, the NAFLD 
Simulator could be used as an educational tool among patients and clinicians to 
increase awareness of the health consequences of NAFLD.

AIMS: Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) is a major concern regarding 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) durability. We aimed to assess 
incidence, correlates, causes, and outcome of early to mid-term BVD after TAVI 
in relation to patient's life expectancy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive TAVI recipients (2007-20) with a follow-up ≥1 
year were prospectively included. BVD and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) were 
assessed according to Valve-Academic-Research-Consortium-3. BVD/BVF and 
all-cause death served as endpoints. Average life expectancy was calculated from 
National Open Health Data and patients were stratified according to tertiles 
(1st: <6.85 years, 2nd: 6.85-9.7 years, 3rd: >9.7 years). Of 1047 patients (81.6 
± 6.8 years old, EuroSCORE II 4.5 ± 2.5), ≥2 follow ups were available from 622 
(serial echo cohort). After a median echo follow up of 12.2 months, incidence 
rates of BVD/BVF were 8.4% (95% confidence interval 6.7-10.3), and 3.5% 
(2.5-4.9) per valve-year, respectively, without differences between life 
expectancy tertiles. The incidence of BVD was two-fold higher within the first 
year of implant (9.9% per valve-year) vs. beyond (4.8% per valve-year). 
Valve-in-valve procedure and residual stenosis, but not age/life expectancy 
predisposed for BVD. BVD/BVF were independently associated with outcome for 
patients in the first [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.72 (1.06-2.88)/2.97 
(1.72-6.22)] and second [AHR 1.96 (1.02-3.73)/2.31 (1.00-5.30)], but not the 
third tertile of life expectancy (P = n.s.).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective observational cohort, early to mid-term 
BVD after TAVI occurred at the same rate across the spectrum of life expectancy 
and was associated with increased mortality in patients with short but not in 
those with the longest life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon 
malignant epithelial tumor of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Orbital ACC is 
rare, originating commonly from the lacrimal gland, with only a few cases 
reported without lacrimal gland involvement. Deep orbital ACC may be associated 
with extension into skull base structures, and further intracranial invasion.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 47-year-old gentleman who presented with 
insidious onset of bilateral proptosis, left ophthalmoplegia, and loss of 
vision. Imaging revealed left orbital infiltrative mass with intracranial 
invasion and bilateral cavernous sinus extension. The lacrimal gland was not 
involved clinically nor radiologically. Histopathology showed ACC with classical 
cribriform pattern. There was no evidence of primary source of tumor or 
metastasis.
DISCUSSION: ACC of the orbit commonly originates from the lacrimal gland. Only a 
few cases of orbital ACC without lacrimal gland involvement were found in 
English literature. Workup for our patient did not reveal a primary source of 
tumor. Tumor may have risen from ectopic orbital lacrimal gland tissue, 
extension from non-orbital sites, or through perineural or hematogenous spread. 
Only one case of bilateral cavernous sinus extension has been previously 
reported. Treatment for advanced orbital ACC is exenteration in most cases. 
However, due to the advanced nature of disease in our patient, palliative 
radiotherapy was the treatment of choice.
CONCLUSION: Orbital ACC of non-lacrimal origin is rare and is associated with 
high morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and treatment are key for 
preventing organ and life-threatening complications such as advanced 
intracranial spread.

This study evaluated the ameliorative properties of Azanza garckeana in 
Bisphenol A-induced reproductive toxicities on weight, spermiogram, serum 
hormonal profile, sperm DNA integrity, histopathology of testes and brain 
tissues of rabbit bucks. Twenty-eight rabbit bucks, with live weight of 
1.20-2.00 kg and aged 10-18 months. They were randomly divided into four groups 
of seven bucks each, group A was administered distilled water (1.5 mL) daily for 
12 weeks, group B was administered Bisphenol A (100 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive 
days in a week for a period of 12 weeks, group C was administered Azanza 
garckeana (500 mg/kg) daily for 12 weeks and group D was pre-dosed with 
Bisphenol A (100 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days in a week over 6 weeks period 
followed by Azanza garckeana (500 mg/kg) daily for another 6 weeks. Mean 
testicular weights differed significantly (p < 0.05) between group B 
(4.4 ± 0.23) when compared with groups A (8.0 ± 0.06), C (8.7 ± 0.19) and D 
(7.1 ± 0.18). There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the mean reaction 
time, spermiogram, testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinising 
hormone and sperm DNA fragmentation index between Bisphenol A-exposed groups and 
treatment groups. On histopathology, there was testicular vacuolization, 
interstitial hemorrhage, reduction in spermatogenic cells following Bisphenol A 
exposure. There were layers of dense basophilic cells in the pineal and 
pituitary parenchymas. In conclusion, Bisphenol A has negative effects on 
reproduction but administration of Azanza garckeana may possess some therapeutic 
properties that can ameliorate such adverse effects.
