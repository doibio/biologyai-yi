BACKGROUND: There is a trend towards decentralisation of laboratory tests by 
means of Point-of-Care testing (POCT). Within hospitals, Belgian law requires a 
POCT policy, coordinated by the clinical laboratory. There is however no legal 
framework for POCT performed outside the hospital: no reimbursement, no 
compulsory quality monitoring and no limits nor control on the prices charged to 
the patient. Uncontrolled use of POCT can have negative consequences for 
individual and public health.
PROPOSAL: We propose that POCT outside hospitals would only be reimbursed for 
tests carried out within a legal framework, requiring evidence-based testing and 
collaboration with a clinical laboratory, because clinical laboratories have 
procedures for test validation and quality monitoring, are equipped for 
electronic data transfer, are familiar with logistical processes, can provide 
support when technical issues arise and can organise and certify training. Under 
these conditions the government investment will be offset by health benefits, 
e.g. fall in antibiotic consumption with POCT for CRP in primary care, quick 
response to SARS-CoV2-positive cases in COVID-19 triage centres.
PRIORITIES: 1° extension of the Belgian decree on certification of clinical 
laboratories to decentralised tests in primary care; 2° introduction of a 
separate reimbursement category for POCT; 3° introduction of reimbursement for a 
limited number of specified POCT; 4° setup of a Multidisciplinary POCT Advisory 
Council, the purpose of which is to draw up a model for reimbursement of POCT, 
to select tests eligible for reimbursement and to make proposals to the National 
Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI).

Introduction: Hybrid closed-loop systems increase time-in-range (TIR) and reduce 
glycemic variability. Person-reported outcomes (PROs) are essential to assess 
the utility of new devices and their impact on quality of life. This article 
focuses on the PROs for pediatric participants (ages 6-13 years) with type 1 
diabetes (T1D) and their parents during a trial using the Tandem Control-IQ 
system, which was shown to increase TIR and improve other glycemic metrics. 
Research Design and Methods: One hundred and one children 6 to 13 years old with 
T1D were randomly assigned to closed-loop control (CLC) or sensor-augmented pump 
(SAP) in a 16-week randomized clinical trial with extension to 28 weeks during 
which the SAP group crossed over to CLC. Health-related quality of life and 
treatment satisfaction measures were obtained from children and their parents at 
baseline, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks. Results: Neither the children in the CLC group 
nor their parents had statistically significant changes in PRO outcomes compared 
with the SAP group at the end of the 16-week randomized controlled trial and the 
28-week extension. Parents in the CLC group reported nonsignificant improvements 
in some PRO scores when compared with the SAP group at 16 weeks, which were 
sustained at 28 weeks. Sleep scores for parents improved from "poor sleep 
quality" to "adequate sleep quality" between baseline and 16 weeks, however, the 
change in scores was not statistically different between groups. Conclusions: 
Children with T1D who used the Control-IQ system did not experience increased 
burden compared with those using SAP based on person-reported outcomes from the 
children and their parents. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT03844789.

Despite intense research efforts, our pharmaceutical repertoire against 
high-grade brain tumours has not been able to increase patient survival for a 
decade and life expectancy remains at less than 16 months after diagnosis, on 
average. Inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have been 
developed and investigated over the past 15 years and have now entered oncology 
clinical trials, including for brain tumours. This review collates recent 
advances in the understanding of the role of PRMTs and arginine methylation in 
brain tumours. We provide an up-to-date literature review on the mechanisms for 
PRMT regulation. These include endogenous modulators such as alternative 
splicing, miRNA, post-translational modifications and PRMT-protein interactions, 
and synthetic inhibitors. We discuss the relevance of PRMTs in brain tumours 
with a particular focus on PRMT1, -2, -5 and -8. Finally, we include a future 
perspective where we discuss possible routes for further research on arginine 
methylation and on the use of PRMT inhibitors in the context of brain tumours.

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first described in 1981, and 
continues to be one of the worst global health pandemics in recorded history. 
Concerted international efforts have helped to increase awareness of human 
immunodeficiency (HIV) status, improve access to treatment and continuation of 
therapy to achieve viral suppression with a goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 
2030. The clinical outcomes for patients living with HIV on combined 
antiretroviral therapy are considerably improved with prolonged life expectancy 
and superior quality of life. Further, perinatal transmission rates have 
dramatically decreased with elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV 
in a growing number of countries worldwide. However, there have been significant 
reductions in the pace of progress in treatment expansion for pregnant women 
with failure to meet global targets in 2018. In this review, we will highlight 
recent advances and challenges ahead in 2020 for three areas of perinatal care 
for women with HIV in developed countries: (a) pregnancy planning 
considerations, (b) impact of antiviral medications on perinatal outcomes, and 
(c) infant feeding practices. The promise of a HIV-free generation is on the 
horizon and continued international efforts in preventing perinatal transmission 
are an important component of this achievement.

In October 2018, cucumber plants showing yellowing and chlorotic mottle symptoms 
were observed in a greenhouse in Chungbuk, South Korea. The observed symptoms 
were similar to those caused by cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV), 
which has been detected on cucumber plants in the region since it was reported 
on melon in Korea in 2015 (Lee et al 2015). To identify the potential agents 
causing these symptoms, 28 samples from symptomatic leaves and fruit of cucumber 
plants were subjected to total RNA extraction using the Plant RNA Prep Kit 
(Biocubesystem, Korea). Reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-PCR) was 
performed on total RNA using CABYV specific primers and protocols (Kwak et al. 
2018). CABYV was detected in 17 of the 28 samples, while 11 symptomatic samples 
tested negative. In order to identify the cause of the symptoms, RT-PCR was 
performed using cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) and cucurbit yellow 
stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) specific primers (Wintermantel et al. 2019). 
Eight of the 28 samples were positive using the CCYV specific primers while 
seven samples were infected with only CCYV and one contained a mixed infection 
of CABYV with CCYV. None of the samples tested positive for CYSDV. The expected 
373 nt amplicons of CCYV were bi-directionally sequenced, and BLASTn analysis 
showed that the nucleotide sequences shared 98 to 100% identity with CCYV 
isolates from East Asia, including NC0180174 from Japan. Two pairs of primers 
for amplification of the complete coat protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
(RdRp) genes (Wintermantel et al., 2019) were used to amplify the 753bp coat 
protein and 1517bp RdRp genes, respectively. Amplicons of the expected sizes 
were obtained from a CCYV single infection and ligated into the pGEM T- Easy 
vector (Promega, WI, USA). Three clones from each amplicon were sequenced and 
aligned using Geneious Prime and found to have identical sequences (Genbank 
accession nos. MW033300, MW033301). The CP and RdRp sequences demonstrated 99% 
nucleotide and 100% amino acid identity with the respective genes and proteins 
of the CCYV isolates from Japan. This study documents the first report of CCYV 
in Korea. Since CCYV was first detected on melon in Japan, it has been reported 
in many other countries including those in East Asia, the Middle East, Southern 
Europe, North Africa, and recently in North America. CCYV has the potential to 
become a serious threat to production of cucurbit crops in Korea, particularly 
due to the increasing prevalence of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in greenhouse 
production systems. It will be important to continue monitoring for CCYV and 
determine potential alternate hosts in the region to manage and prevent further 
spread of CCYV in Korea.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are challenges in comparability when using 
existing life lost measures to examine long-term trends in premature mortality. 
To address this important issue, we have developed a novel measure termed 
average lifespan shortened (ALSS). In the present study, we used the ALSS 
measure to describe temporal changes in premature mortality due to stroke in the 
Canadian population from 1990 to 2015.
METHODS: Mortality data for stroke were obtained from the World Health 
Organization mortality database. Years of life lost was calculated using 
Canadian life tables. ALSS was calculated as the ratio of years of life lost in 
relation to the expected lifespan.
RESULTS: Over a 25-year timeframe, the age-standardized rates adjusted to the 
World Standard Population for deaths from all strokes and stroke types 
substantially decreased in both sexes. The ALSS measure indicated that men who 
died of stroke lost 12.1% of their lifespan in 1990 and 11.4% in 2015, whereas 
these values among women were 11.1% and 10.0%, respectively. Patients with 
subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke lost the largest portion whereby both sexes lost 
about one-third of their lifespan in 1990 and one-fourth in 2015. Men with 
intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke lost around 18% of their lifespan in 1990 and 
14% in 2015 as compared to women who lost about 16% and 12% over the same 
timeframe. The loss of lifespan for patients with ischemic stroke and other 
stroke types combined was relatively stable at about 10% throughout the study 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a modest improvement in lifespan among 
patients with stroke in Canada between 1990 and 2015. Our novel ALSS measure 
provides intuitive interpretation of temporal changes in lifespan among patients 
with stroke and helps to enhance our understanding of the burden of strokes in 
the Canadian population.

AIM: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of an atrial fibrillation 
disease management program (i.e. the SAFETY program) from the Australian 
healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A multistate Markov model was developed based on patient-level data 
from the SAFETY randomized controlled trial. Predicted long-term survival, 
dependent on hospital admission history, was estimated by extrapolating 
parametric survival models. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and life years 
(LY) were the primary and secondary outcome measures used to estimate the 
incremental cost-utility/effectiveness ratio (ICUR/ICER). Both deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were undertaken.
RESULTS: The SAFETY program was associated with both higher costs ($94,953 vs. 
$78,433) and benefits [QALY (3.99 vs 3.60); LY (5.86 vs 5.24)], with an ICUR of 
$42,513/QALY or ICER of $26,356/LY, compared to standard care. Due to the 
extended survival, the SAFETY was associated with a greater number of 
hospitalizations (14.85 vs 11.65) and higher costs for medications ($25,084 vs 
$22,402) and outpatient care ($12,904 vs $11,524). The cost per hospitalization 
for an average length of stay, analytical time horizon, and cost of medication 
are key determinants of ICUR. The PSA showed that the intervention has a 70.4% 
probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The SAFETY program has a high probability of being cost-effective 
for patients with atrial fibrillation. It is associated with uncertainty that 
further research could potentially eliminate; implementation with further 
evidence collection is recommended.

BACKGROUND: With the extended life expectancy of the Chinese population and 
improvements in surgery and anesthesia techniques, the number of aged patients 
undergoing surgery has been increasing annually. However, safety, effectiveness, 
and quality of life of aged patients undergoing surgery are facing major 
challenges. In order to standardize the perioperative assessment and procedures, 
we have developed a perioperative evaluation and auxiliary decision-making 
system named "Aged Patient Perioperative Longitudinal 
Evaluation-Multidisciplinary Trial (APPLE-MDT)".
METHODS: We will conduct a perioperative risk evaluation and targeted 
intervention, with follow-ups at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. The primary 
objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the "Aged Patient 
Perioperative Longitudinal Evaluation-Multiple Disciplinary Trial Path" 
(hereinafter referred to as the APPLE-MDT path) in surgical decision-making for 
aged patients (≥75 years) undergoing elective surgery under non-local anesthesia 
in the operating room. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the 
postoperative outcome and health economics of the APPLE-MDT path applied to the 
surgical decision-making of aged patients (≥75 years) undergoing elective 
surgery under non-local anesthesia and to optimize intervention strategies for 
aged patients undergoing surgery to reduce the occurrence of postoperative 
complications and improve the quality of life after surgery.
DISCUSSION: It is necessary to formulate a reliable, effective, and concise 
evaluation tool, which can effectively predict the perioperative complications 
and mortality of aged patients, support targeted intervention strategies, and 
allow for a more comprehensive risk and benefit analysis, thereby forming an 
effective senile perioperative surgery management path. It is expected that the 
implementation of this protocol can reduce the occurrence of postoperative 
complications, improve the postoperative quality of life, shorten hospital stay, 
reduce hospitalization expenses, reduce social burden, and allow the elderly to 
have a good quality of life after surgery.

BACKGROUND: Combined with cancer screening programs, vaccination against human 
papillomavirus (HPV) can significantly reduce the high health and economic 
burden of HPV-related disease in Japan. The objective of this study was to 
assess the health impact and cost effectiveness of routine and catch-up 
vaccination of girls and women aged 11-26 years with a 4-valent (4vHPV) or 
9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine in Japan compared with no vaccination.
METHODS: We used a mathematical model adapted to the population and healthcare 
settings in Japan. We compared no vaccination and routine vaccination of 
12-16-year old girls with 1) 4vHPV vaccine, 2) 9vHPV vaccine, and 3) 9vHPV 
vaccine in addition to a temporary catch-up vaccination of 17-26 years old girls 
and women with 9vHPV. We estimated the expected number of disease cases and 
deaths, discounted (at 2% per year) future costs (in 2020 ¥) and discounted 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios 
(ICER) of each strategy over a time horizon of 100 years. To test the robustness 
of the conclusions, we conducted scenario and sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Over 100 years, compared with no vaccination, 9vHPV vaccination was 
projected to reduce the incidence of 9vHPV-related cervical cancer by 86% (from 
15.24 new cases per 100,000 women in 2021 to 2.02 in 2121). A greater number of 
cervical cancer cases (484,248) and cancer-related deaths (50,102) were avoided 
through the described catch-up vaccination program. Routine HPV vaccination with 
4vHPV or 9vHPV vaccine prevented 5,521,000 cases of anogenital warts among women 
and men. Around 23,520 and 21,400 diagnosed non-cervical cancers are prevented 
by catch-up vaccination among women and men, respectively. Compared with no 
vaccination, the ICER of 4vHPV vaccination was ¥975,364/QALY. Compared to 4vHPV, 
9vHPV + Catch-up had an ICER of ¥1,534,493/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: A vaccination program with a 9-valent vaccine targeting 12 to 
16 year-old girls together with a temporary catchup program will avert 
significant numbers of cases of HPV-related diseases among both men and women. 
Furthermore, such a program was the most cost effective among the vaccination 
strategies we considered, with an ICER well below a threshold of ¥5000,000/QALY.

BACKGROUND: Tonga is a South Pacific Island country with a population of 100,651 
(2016 Census). This study examines Tongan infant mortality rates (IMR), 
under-five mortality rates (U5MR), adult mortality and life expectancy (LE) at 
birth from 2010 to 2018 using a recent collation of empirical mortality data 
over the past decade for comparison with other previously published mortality 
estimates.
METHODS: Routinely collected mortality data for 2010-2018 from the Ministry of 
Health, national (Vaiola) hospital, community nursing reports, and the Civil 
Registry, were consolidated by deterministic and probabilistic linkage of 
individual death records. Completeness of empirical mortality reporting was 
assessed by capture-recapture analysis. The reconciled data were aggregated into 
triennia to reduce stochastic variation, and used to estimate IMR and U5MR (per 
1000 live births), adult mortality (15-59, 15-34, 35-59, and 15-64 years), and 
LE at birth, employing the hypothetical cohort method (with statistical 
testing). Mortality trends and differences were assessed by Poisson regression. 
Mortality findings were compared with published national and international 
agency estimates.
RESULTS: Over the three triennia in 2010-2018, levels varied minimally for IMR 
(12-14) and U5MR (15-19) per 1000 births (both ns, p > 0.05), and also for male 
LE at birth of 64-65 years, and female LE at birth 69-70 years. Cumulated risks 
of adult mortality were significantly higher in men than women; period mortality 
increases in 15-59-year women from 18 to 21% were significant (p < 0.05). 
Estimated completeness of the reconciled data was > 95%. International agencies 
reported generally comparable estimates of IMR and U5MR, with varying 
uncertainty intervals; but they reported significantly lower adult mortality and 
higher LE than the empirical estimates from this study.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy in Tonga over 2010-2018 has remained relatively low 
and static, with low IMR and U5MR, indicating the substantial impact from 
premature adult mortality. This analysis of empirical data (> 95% complete) 
indicates lower LE and higher premature adult mortality than previously reported 
by international agencies using indirect and modelled methods. Continued 
integration of mortality recording and data systems in Tonga is important for 
improving the completeness and accuracy of mortality estimation for local health 
monitoring and planning.

BACKGROUND: Increasing the coverage of community-based treatment of childhood 
pneumonia (CCM) is part of the strategy to improve child survival, increase 
life-expectancy at birth and promote equity in Ethiopia. However, full coverage 
of CCM has not been reached in any regions of the country. There are no 
sub-national cost-effectiveness analyses available to inform decision makers on 
the most equitable scale up strategy.
OBJECTIVES: Our first objective is to estimate the sub-national 
cost-effectiveness and the interindividual inequality impacts of scaling up CCM 
coverages to 90% in each region. Our second objective is to explore the costs, 
health effects, and geographical inequality impacts associated with three 
scale-up scenarios promoting different policy-aims: maximizing health, reducing 
geographical inequalities, and achieving 90% universal coverage.
METHODS: We used Markov modelling to estimate the sub-national 
cost-effectiveness of CCM in each region. All data were collected through 
literature review and adjusted to the region-specific proportions of the rural 
population. Health effects were modeled as life years gained and under-five 
deaths averted. Interindividual and geographical inequality impacts were 
measured by the GINI index applied to health. In scenario analysis we explored 
three different scale-up strategies: 1) maximizing health by prioritizing the 
regions where the intervention was the most cost-effective, 2) reducing 
geographical inequalities by prioritizing the regions with high baseline 
under-five mortality rate (U5MR), and 3) universal upscaling to 90% coverage in 
all the regions.
RESULTS: The regional incremental-cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of scaling up 
the intervention coverage varied from 26 USD per life year gained in Addis to 
199 USD per life year gained in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and 
Peoples' region. Universal upscaling of CCM in all regions would cost about 1.3 
billion USD and prevent about 90,000 under-five deaths. This is less than 15,000 
USD per life saved and translates to an increase in life expectancy at birth of 
1.6 years across Ethiopia. In scenario analysis, we found that prioritizing 
regions with high U5MR is effective in reducing geographical inequalities, 
although at the cost of fewer lives saved as compared to the health maximizing 
strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model results illustrate a trade-off between maximizing health 
and reducing health inequalities, two common policy-aims in low-income settings.

BACKGROUND: Retrospective questionnaire and healthcare administrative data 
suggest reduced life expectancy in untreated hereditary hemorrhagic 
telangiectasia (HHT). Prospective data suggests similar mortality, to the 
general population, in Denmark's centre-treated HHT patients. However, clinical 
phenotypes vary widely in HHT, likely affecting mortality. We aimed to measure 
predictors of mortality among centre-treated HHT patients. HHT patients were 
recruited at 14 HHT centres of the Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium (BVMC) 
since 2010 and followed annually. Vital status, organ vascular malformations 
(VMs) and clinical symptoms data were collected at baseline and during follow-up 
(N = 1286). We tested whether organ VMs, HHT symptoms and HHT genes were 
associated with increased mortality using Cox regression analysis, adjusting for 
patient age, sex, and smoking status.
RESULTS: 59 deaths occurred over average follow-up time of 3.4 years (max 
8.6 years). A history of anemia was associated with increased mortality 
(HR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.37-6.26, p = 0.006), as were gastro-intestinal (GI) 
bleeding (HR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.46-4.74, p = 0.001), and symptomatic liver VMs 
(HR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.84, p = 0.015). Brain VMs and pulmonary arteriovenous 
malformations (AVMs) were not associated with mortality (p > 0.05). Patients 
with SMAD4 mutation had significantly higher mortality (HR = 18.36, 95% CI 
5.60-60.20, p < 0.001) compared to patients with ACVRL1 or ENG mutation, but 
this estimate is imprecise given the rarity of SMAD4 patients (n = 33, 4 
deaths).
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic GI bleeding, anemia and symptomatic liver VMs are 
associated with increased mortality in HHT patients, independent of age, and in 
keeping with the limited treatment options for these aspects of HHT. Conversely, 
mortality does not appear to be associated with pulmonary AVMs or brain VMs, for 
which patients are routinely screened and treated preventatively at HHT Centres. 
This demonstrates the need for development of new therapies to treat chronic 
anemia, GI bleeding, and symptomatic liver VMs in order to reduce mortality 
among HHT patients.

BACKGROUND: Heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae has been proposed as a 
viable alternative method for novel high-value biomolecules, enriched biomass, 
and biofuel production because of their allowance of high cell density levels, 
as well as simple production technology. Tetradesmus bernardii, a newly isolated 
high-yielding oleaginous microalga under photoautotrophic conditions, is able to 
grow heterotrophically, meaning that it can consume organic carbon sources in 
dark condition. We investigated the effect of different carbon/nitrogen (C/N) 
ratios on the growth and lipid accumulation of T. bernardii in heterotrophic 
batch culture under two nitrogen sources (NaNO3 and CO(NH2)2). In addition, we 
conducted time-resolved transcriptome analysis to reveal the metabolic mechanism 
of T. bernardii in heterotrophic culture.
RESULTS: T. bernardii can accumulate high biomass concentrations in 
heterotrophic batch culture where the highest biomass of 46.09 g/L was achieved 
at 100 g/L glucose concentration. The rate of glucose to biomass exceeded 55% 
when the glucose concentration was less than 80 g/L, and the C/N ratio was 44 at 
urea treatment. The culture was beneficial to lipid accumulation at a C/N ratio 
between 110 and 130. NaNO3 used as a nitrogen source enhanced the lipid content 
more than urea, and the highest lipid content was 45% of dry weight. We 
performed RNA-seq to analyze the time-resolved transcriptome of T. bernardii. As 
the nitrogen was consumed in the medium, nitrogen metabolism-related genes were 
significantly up-regulated to speed up the N metabolic cycle. As chloroplasts 
were destroyed in the dark, the metabolism of cells was transferred from 
chloroplasts to cytoplasm. However, storage of carbohydrate in chloroplast 
remained active, mainly the synthesis of starch, and the precursor of starch 
synthesis in heterotrophic culture may largely come from the absorption of 
organic carbon source (glucose). With regard to lipid metabolism, the related 
genes of fatty acid synthesis in low nitrogen concentration increased gradually 
with the extension of cultivation time.
CONCLUSION: T. bernardii exhibited rapid growth and high lipid accumulation in 
heterotrophic culture. It may be a potential candidate for biomass and biofuel 
production. Transcriptome analysis showed that multilevel regulation ensured the 
conversion from carbon to the synthesis of carbohydrate and lipid.

Withholding or withdrawing life-saving ventilators can become necessary when 
resources are insufficient. In the USA, such rationing has unique social justice 
dimensions. Structural elements of dominant allocation frameworks simultaneously 
advantage white communities, and disadvantage Black communities-who already 
experience a disproportionate burden of COVID-19-related job losses, 
hospitalisations and mortality. Using the example of New Jersey's Crisis 
Standard of Care policy, we describe how dominant rationing guidance compounds 
for many Black patients prior unfair structural disadvantage, chiefly due to the 
way creatinine and life expectancy are typically considered.We outline six 
possible policy options towards a more just approach: improving diversity in 
decision processes, adjusting creatinine scores, replacing creatinine, dropping 
creatinine, finding alternative measures, adding equity weights and rejecting 
the dominant model altogether. We also contrast these options with making no 
changes, which is not a neutral default, but in separate need of justification, 
despite a prominent claim that it is simply based on 'objective medical 
knowledge'. In the regrettable absence of fair federal guidance, hospital and 
state-level policymakers should reflect on which of these, or further options, 
seem feasible and justifiable.Irrespective of which approach is taken, all 
guidance should be supplemented with a monitoring and reporting requirement on 
possible disparate impacts. The hope that we will be able to continue to avoid 
rationing ventilators must not stand in the way of revising guidance in a way 
that better promotes health equity and racial justice, both to be prepared, and 
given the significant expressive value of ventilator guidance.

Importance: In the treatment of persistent depressive disorder (PDD), 
disorder-specific Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) 
has been shown to be superior to Supportive Psychotherapy (SP) in outpatients. 
It remains to clear which subgroups of patients benefit equally and 
differentially from both psychotherapies. Objective: To identify those 
patient-level baseline characteristics that predict a comparable treatment 
effectiveness of CBASP and SP and those that moderate the differential 
effectiveness of CBASP compared to SP. Design, setting and participants: In this 
analysis of a 48-week multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing CBASP to 
SP in adult antidepressant-free outpatients with early-onset PDD, we evaluated 
baseline variables from the following domains as potential predictors and 
moderators of treatment effectiveness: socio-demography, clinical status, 
psychosocial and global functioning, life quality, interpersonal problems, 
childhood trauma, treatment history, preference for psychotherapy, and treatment 
expectancy. Interventions: A 48-week treatment program with 32 sessions of 
either CBASP or SP. Main outcomes and measures: Depression severity measured by 
the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) at week 48. Results: 
From N = 268 randomized outpatients, N = 209 completed the 48-week treatment 
program. CBASP completers had significantly lower post-treatment HRSD-24 scores 
than SP completers (meanCBASP=13.96, sdCBASP= 9.56; meanSP= 16.69, sdSP= 9.87; p 
= 0.04). A poor response to both therapies was predicted by higher baseline 
levels of clinician-rated depression, elevated suicidality, comorbid anxiety, 
lower social functioning, higher social inhibition, moderate-to-severe early 
emotional or sexual abuse, no preference for psychotherapy, and the history of 
at least one previous inpatient treatment. Moderator analyses revealed that 
patients with higher baseline levels of self-rated depression, comorbidity of at 
least one Axis-I disorder, self-reported moderate-to-severe early emotional or 
physical neglect, or at least one previous antidepressant treatment, had a 
significantly lower post-treatment depression severity with CBASP compared to SP 
(all p < 0.05). Conclusions and relevance: A complex multifactorial interaction 
between severe symptoms of depression, suicidality, and traumatic childhood 
experiences characterized by abuse, social inhibition, and anxiety may represent 
the basis of non-response to psychotherapy in patients with early onset PDD. 
Specific psychotherapy with CBASP might, however, be more effective and 
recommendable for a variety of particularly burdened patients compared to SP.
