and cause-specific mortality by calculating minimally adjusted and mutually 
adjusted hazard ratios [HR] and 95% CIs. We also estimated the population 
attributable fraction and the years of life lost due to suboptimal risk factors.
FINDINGS: During 26·6 million person-years at risk (mean follow-up 13·3 years 
[SD 6·4 years]), 310 277 participants died. HR for the 25 × 25 risk factors and 
mortality varied between 1·04 (95% CI 0·98-1·11) for obesity in men and 2 ·17 
(2·06-2·29) for current smoking in men. Participants with low socioeconomic 
status had greater mortality compared with those with high socioeconomic status 
(HR 1·42, 95% CI 1·38-1·45 for men; 1·34, 1·28-1·39 for women); this association 
remained significant in mutually adjusted models that included the 25 × 25 
factors (HR 1·26, 1·21-1·32, men and women combined). The population 
attributable fraction was highest for smoking, followed by physical inactivity 
then socioeconomic status. Low socioeconomic status was associated with a 
2·1-year reduction in life expectancy between ages 40 and 85 years, the 
corresponding years-of-life-lost were 0·5 years for high alcohol intake, 0·7 
years for obesity, 3·9 years for diabetes, 1·6 years for hypertension, 2·4 years 
for physical inactivity, and 4·8 years for current smoking.
INTERPRETATION: Socioeconomic circumstances, in addition to the 25 × 25 factors, 
should be targeted by local and global health strategies and health risk 
surveillance to reduce mortality.

Demographic changes, with substantial increase in life expectancy, ask for solid 
knowledge about how pain perception might be altered by aging. Although 
psychophysical studies on age-related changes in pain perception have been 
conducted over more than 70 years, meta-analyses are still missing. The present 
meta-analysis aimed to quantify evidence on age-related changes in pain 
perception, indexed by pain thresholds and pain tolerance thresholds in young 
and older healthy adults. After searching PubMed, Google Scholar and PsycINFO 
using state-of-art screening (PRISMA-criteria), 31 studies on pain threshold and 
9 studies assessing pain tolerance threshold were identified. Pain threshold 
increases with age, which is indicated by a large effect size. This age-related 
change increases the wider the age-gap between groups; and is especially 
prominent when heat is used and when stimuli are applied to the head. In 
contrast, pain tolerance thresholds did not show substantial age-related 
changes. Thus, after many years of investigating age-related changes in pain 
perception, we only have firm evidence that aging reduces pain sensitivity for 
lower pain intensities.

Overexpression of Ecl1-family genes (ecl1 +, ecl2 +, and ecl3 +) results in the 
extension of the chronological life span in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. However, 
the mechanism for this extension has not been defined clearly. Ecl1-family 
proteins consist of approximately 80 amino acids, and four cysteine residues are 
conserved in their N-terminal domains. This study focused on the Ecl1 protein, 
mutating its cysteine residues sequentially to confirm their importance. As a 
result, all mutated Ecl1 proteins nearly lost the function to extend the 
chronological life span, suggesting that these four cysteine residues are 
essential for the Ecl1 protein. Utilizing ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma 
atomic emission spectroscopy) analysis, we found that wild-type Ecl1 proteins 
contain zinc, while cysteine-mutated Ecl1 proteins do not. We also analyzed the 
effect of environmental zinc on the chronological life span. We found that zinc 
limitation extends the chronological life span, and this extension depends on 
the Ecl1-family proteins.

Enabling healthy living: Experiences of people with severe mental illness in 
psychiatric outpatient services.

It is well known that people with severe mental illness have a reduced life 
expectancy and a greater risk of being affected by preventable physical 
illnesses such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and type 2 
diabetes. There are still, however, only a few published studies focusing on 
what enables healthy living for this group. This study thus aimed to describe 
what enables healthy living among people with severe mental illness in 
psychiatric outpatient services. The data were collected in qualitative 
interviews (n = 16) and content analysis was used to analyze the data. The 
interviews resulted in an overall theme "Being regarded as a whole human being 
by self and others", which showed the multidimensional nature of health and the 
issues that enable healthy living among people with severe mental illness. Three 
categories emerged: (i) everyday structure (ii), motivating life events and 
(iii) support from significant others. The results indicate that a person with 
severe mental illness needs to be encountered as a whole person if healthy 
living is to be enabled. Attaining healthy living requires collaboration between 
the providers of care, help and support. Health care organizations need to work 
together to develop and provide interventions to enable healthy living and to 
reduce poor physical health among people with severe mental illness.

AIMS: This study compared the cause-specific standardized mortality ratios 
(SMRs) and expected years of life lost (EYLL) among opioid-dependent individuals 
in the United States and Taiwan.
METHODS: Survival data came from two cohorts followed until 2014: The U.S. data 
were based on a randomized trial of 1267 opioid-dependent participants enrolled 
between 2006 and 2009; the Taiwan data were from a study of 983 individuals that 
began in 2006, when opioid agonist treatment (OAT) was implemented in Taiwan. 
SMRs were calculated for each national cohort and compared. Kaplan-Meier 
estimation was performed on the survival data, then lifespans were extrapolated 
to 70 years (840 months) to estimate life expectancy using a semi-parametric 
method. EYLLs for both cohorts were estimated by subtracting their life 
expectancies from the age- and gender-matched referents within the general 
population of their respective country.
RESULTS: Compared with age- and gender-matched referents, the SMRs were 3.2 for 
the U.S. sample and 7.8 for the Taiwan sample; the EYLLs were 7.7 and 16.4 
years, respectively. Half of decedents died of unnatural causes in both cohorts; 
overdose deaths predominated in the U.S. and suicide in Taiwan.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified differences by country in EYLL and causes of 
deaths. These findings suggest that intervention strategies to reduce mortality 
risk by overdose (particularly in the U.S.) and suicide (particularly in Taiwan) 
are urgently needed in these countries.

Therapy with biopharmaceuticals, mainly recombinant antibodies, offers patients 
higher life expectancy and better life quality than pharmacologic therapy. 
Countries with the highest scientific development are investing in this kind of 
therapy, and this is why the optimization of the production of these recombinant 
proteins would lead to their higher production and lower costs of the final 
product. Modifications in the use of promoters, the use of recombination 
regions, and the change in the order of the chains, are some of the genetic 
engineering changes that can increase the production of recombinant antibodies. 
In this work, three different promoters were tested: Prom A, hCMV, and EF1-a, 
for two different antibodies, one anti-TNFa and one anti-CD20+. Changes were 
made in the order of the chains H-L or L-H and one or two UCOE (ubiquitous 
chromatin opening element) sequences were also used to identify the combinations 
that provide the best transient and stable expression for the antibodies in the 
CHO-s cells. In our results, we observed that the use of the two UCOE regions, 
with L-H order is almost three times better for the expression of the two 
different antibodies, while the strength of the promoter is conditioned by the 
sequence of each expressed protein.

There is a dearth of data from Ecuador on the burden of life-threatening fungal 
disease entities; therefore, we estimated the burden of serious fungal 
infections in Ecuador based on the populations at risk and available 
epidemiological databases and publications. A full literature search was done to 
identify all epidemiology papers reporting fungal infection rates. WHO, 
ONU-AIDS, Index Mundi, Global Asthma Report, Globocan, and national data 
[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INEC), Ministerio de Salud Pública 
(MSP), Sociedad de Lucha Contra el Cáncer (SOLCA), Instituto Nacional de 
Donación y Trasplante de Órganos, Tejidos y Células (INDOT)] were reviewed. When 
no data existed, risk populations were used to estimate frequencies of fungal 
infections, using previously described methodology by LIFE. Ecuador has a 
variety of climates from the cold of the Andes through temperate to humid hot 
weather at the coast and in the Amazon basin. Ecuador has a population of 
15,223,680 people and an average life expectancy of 76 years. The median 
estimate of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) population at risk for fungal disease (<200 CD4 cell counts) is 
∼10,000, with a rate of 11.1% (1100) of histoplasma, 7% (700) of cryptococcal 
meningitis, and 11% (1070) of Pneumocystis pneumonia. The burden of candidemia 
is 1037. Recurrent Candida vaginitis (≥4 episodes per year) affects 307,593 
women aged 15-50 years. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis probably affects ∼476 
patients following tuberculosis (TB). Invasive aspergillosis is estimated to 
affect 748 patients (∼5.5/100,000). In addition, allergic bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis (ABPA) in asthma and severe asthma with fungal sensitization 
(SAFS) were estimated to affect 26,642 and 45,013 people, respectively. Our 
estimates indicate that 433,856 (3%) of the population in Ecuador is affected by 
serious fungal infection.

Over the last 5 decades, health-care advances have yielded quantum improvements 
in the life expectancy of individuals with congenital genitourinary conditions 
(CGCs), leading to a crisis of care. Many individuals with CGC enter adulthood 
unprepared to manage their condition. Pediatric CGC specialists lack training to 
manage adulthood-related health-care issues, whereas adult genitourinary 
specialists lack training within the context of CGCs. To address these 
challenges, the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases convened individuals with CGCs and experts from a variety of fields to 
identify research needs to improve transitional urology care. This paper 
outlines identified research needs.

The situation with cardiovascular (CV) burden in Russian population is alerting, 
and becomes of interest due to high CV mortality, and shorter lifespan if 
compare with the Western society amid the absence of the established monitoring 
or screening system for major CV risk factors. The purpose of this systematic 
epidemiological update was to explore CV burden in Russia. The study represents 
pooled results with a systematic epidemiological review of the national mass 
screening, selected randomized clinical trials and statistical datasets of the 
national public health CV institutions exploring the trends of the CV burden in 
all 83 regions of Russia. We overviewed data from a number of the available 
Russian-speaking national data sources of 2001-2014, and NANOM-FIM trial 
(NCT01270139) as the only available real-world population study. The CV diseases 
in Russia accounted for 54.9% of all deaths in 2011-2014. The death rate was 
13.3 per 1,000 citizens with CV mortality of 653.9 per 100,000. The life 
expectancy achieves 64.3 years for male and 76.1 years for female. The mean age 
of pts in trial was 51.6 years (77.2% males). A total of 175 Russian PCI centers 
implemented 205,902 angio a year, and 75,378 PCI achieving 531 PCI per 1,000,000 
with placement of 101,451 stents (1.37 stents per PCI; 48,057 DES). The smoking 
(17.3% of screened with a 2,786 cigarettes a year; 70.6% in trial), excessive 
alcohol consumption (1.8% of screened with a 11.6 L per year; 50.6% in trial), 
unhealthy Russian diet (abundance of carbohydrates/sugar, saturated and trans 
fats in 24.3% of screened), psychosocial factors (20%) and physical inactivity 
(19.6% of screened) remain the major modifiable risk factors. They, in turn, 
affect such risk factors as dyslipidemia (86.7% in trial), obesity (16.7% of 
screened; BMI in trial was 28.4), and hypertension (40.8% suffered; 86.1% in 
trial). CV mortality was not directly associated with a level of poverty 
(r=0.26, P=0.02) or socio-economic development (P>0.05) in regions. The 
documented 27% 10-year decline of CV mortality was interpreted as a success of 
the national policy. Mortality statistics show the stark reality of a high CV 
burden in Russia. New national program and aggressive emerging efforts are 
required to tackle CV diseases in Russia.

Purpose. Effectiveness of nonpharmacological multicomponent prevention delivered 
by trained volunteers (medical and psychology students), targeted at delirium 
risk factors in geriatric inpatients, was assessed at an internal medicine ward 
in Poland. Patients and Methods. Participants were recruited to intervention and 
control groups at the internal medicine ward (inclusion criteria: age ≥ 75, 
acute medical condition, basic orientation, and logical contact on admission; 
exclusion criteria: life expectancy < 24 hours, surgical hospitalization, 
isolation due to infectious disease, and discharge to other medical wards). 
Every day trained volunteers delivered a multicomponent standardized 
intervention targeted at risk factors of in-hospital complications to the 
intervention group. The control group, selected using a retrospective individual 
matching strategy (1 : 1 ratio, regarding age, gender, and time of 
hospitalization), received standard care. Outcome Measures. Hospitalization 
time, deaths, falls, delirium episodes, and antipsychotic prescriptions were 
assessed retrospectively from medical documentation. Results. 130 patients 
(38.4% males) participated in the study, with 65 in the intervention group. 
Antipsychotic medications were initiated less frequently in the intervention 
group compared to the control group. There was a trend towards a shorter 
hospitalization time and a not statistically significant decrease in deaths in 
the intervention group. Conclusion. Nonpharmacological multicomponent 
intervention targeted at delirium risk factors effectively reduced length of 
hospitalization and need for initiating antipsychotic treatment in elderly 
patients at the internal medicine ward.

Taste sensitivity plays a major role in controlling feeding behavior, and 
alterations in feeding habit induced by changes in taste sensitivity can drive 
speciation. We investigated variability in taste preferences in wild-derived 
inbred lines from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel. 
Preferences for different sugars, which are essential nutrients for fruit flies, 
were assessed using two-choice preference tests that paired glucose with 
fructose, sucrose, or trehalose. The two-choice tests revealed that individual 
lines have differential and widely variable sugar preferences, and that sugar 
taste sensitivity is polygenic in the inbred population tested. We focused on 2 
strains that exhibited opposing preferences for glucose and fructose, and 
performed proboscis extension reflex tests and electrophysiological recordings 
on taste sensilla upon exposure to fructose and glucose. The results indicated 
that taste sensitivity to fructose is dimorphic between the 2 lines. Genetic 
analysis showed that high sensitivity to fructose is autosomal dominant over low 
sensitivity, and that multiple loci on chromosomes 2 and 3 influence 
sensitivity. Further genetic complementation tests for fructose sensitivity on 
putative gustatory receptor (Gr) genes for sugars suggested that the Gr64a-Gr64f 
locus, not the fructose receptor gene Gr43a, might contribute to the dimorphic 
sensitivity to fructose between the 2 lines.

OBJECTIVE: This study compares the cost and cost-effectiveness of treatments 
options for Sanders II/III displaced intra-articular calcaneus fractures 
(DIACFs) in laborers.
METHODS: Literature on Sanders type II and III fractures was reviewed to 
determine complication rates and utility values for each treatment option. Costs 
were calculated using Medicare reimbursement and implant prices from our 
institution. Monte Carlo simulations were used to analyze a decision tree to 
determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of each treatment from a societal 
perspective. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all variables.
RESULTS: Minimally invasive open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) (sinus tarsi 
approach with 4 screws alone) was least expensive ($23,329), followed by 
nonoperative care ($24,530) and traditional ORIF using extensile lateral 
approach ($27,963) (P < 0.001); this result was most sensitive to time out of 
work. Available cost-effectiveness data were limited, but our analysis suggests 
that minimally invasive ORIF is a dominant strategy, and traditional ORIF is 
superior to nonoperative care (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
$57,217/quality-adjusted life year).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that minimally invasive ORIF (sinus tarsi 
approach) is the least expensive option for managing Sanders II/III displaced 
intra-articular calcaneus fractures, followed by nonoperative care. Our 
cost-effectiveness results favor operative management but are highly sensitive 
to utility values and are weakened by scarce utility data. We therefore cannot 
currently recommend a treatment course based on value, and our primary 
conclusion must be that more extensive effectiveness research (ie, 
health-related quality of life data, not just functional outcomes) is 
desperately needed to elucidate the value of treatment options in this field.

Osteopetroses are a heterogeneous group of rare genetic bone diseases sharing 
the common hallmarks of reduced osteoclast activity, increased bone mass and 
high bone fragility. Osteoclasts are bone resorbing cells that contribute to 
bone growth and renewal through the erosion of the mineralized matrix. Alongside 
the bone forming activity by osteoblasts, osteoclasts allow the skeleton to grow 
harmonically and maintain a healthy balance between bone resorption and 
formation. Osteoclast impairment in osteopetroses prevents bone renewal and 
deteriorates bone quality, causing atraumatic fractures. Osteopetroses vary in 
severity and are caused by mutations in a variety of genes involved in bone 
resorption or in osteoclastogenesis. Frequent signs and symptoms include 
osteosclerosis, deformity, dwarfism and narrowing of the bony canals, including 
the nerve foramina, leading to hematological and neural failures. The disease is 
autosomal, with only one extremely rare form associated so far to the 
X-chromosome, and can have either recessive or dominant inheritance. Recessive 
ostepetroses are generally lethal in infancy or childhood, with a few milder 
forms clinically denominated intermediate osteopetroses. Dominant osteopetrosis 
is so far associated only with mutations in the CLCN7 gene and, although 
described as a benign form, it can be severely debilitating, although not at the 
same level as recessive forms, and can rarely result in reduced life expectancy. 
Severe osteopetroses due to osteoclast autonomous defects can be treated by 
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT), but those due to deficiency of the 
pro-osteoclastogenic cytokine, RANKL, are not suitable for this procedure. 
Likewise, it is unclear as to whether HSCT, which has high intrinsic risks, 
results in clinical improvement in autosomal dominant osteopetrosis. Therefore, 
there is an unmet medical need to identify new therapies and studies are 
currently in progress to test gene and cell therapies, small interfering RNA 
approach and novel pharmacologic treatments.

Honeybees are well known for their complex division of labor. Each bee 
sequentially performs a series of social tasks during its life. The changes in 
social task performance are linked to gross differences in behavior and 
physiology. We tested whether honeybees performing different social tasks 
(nursing versus foraging) would differ in their gustatory responsiveness and 
associative learning behavior in addition to their daily tasks in the colony. 
Further, we investigated the role of the biogenic amine tyramine and its 
receptors in the behavior of nurse bees and foragers. Tyramine is an important 
insect neurotransmitter, which has long been neglected in behavioral studies as 
it was believed to only act as the metabolic precursor of the better-known amine 
octopamine. With the increasing number of characterized tyramine receptors in 
diverse insects, we need to understand the functions of tyramine on its own 
account. Our findings suggest an important role for tyramine and its two 
receptors in regulating honeybee gustatory responsiveness, social organization 
and learning behavior. Foragers, which were more responsive to gustatory stimuli 
than nurse bees and performed better in appetitive learning, also differed from 
nurse bees in their tyramine brain titers and in the mRNA expression of a 
tyramine receptor in the brain. Pharmacological activation of tyramine receptors 
increased gustatory responsiveness of nurse bees and foragers and improved 
appetitive learning in nurse bees. These data suggest that a large part of the 
behavioral differences between honeybees may be directly linked to tyramine 
signaling in the brain.

BACKGROUND: Community health workers can help to address the substantial unmet 
need for child mental health care in low and middle income countries. However, 
little is known about their training needs for this potential role. The aim of 
this study was to examine training needs and perspectives of community health 
extension workers (HEWs) in relation to providing child mental health care in 
rural Ethiopia.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and 
Peoples' Region of Ethiopia. A mixed methods approach was used. A total of 104 
HEWs who had received training in child mental health using the Health Education 
and Training (HEAT) curriculum were interviewed using a structured survey. 
In-depth interviews were then conducted with 11 HEWs purposively selected on the 
basis of the administrative zone they had come from. A framework approach was 
used for qualitative data analysis.
RESULTS: Most of the HEWs (88.5%; n = 93/104) reported that they were interested 
in the training provided and all respondents considered child mental health to 
be important. The perceived benefits of training included improved knowledge 
(n = 52), case identification (n = 14) and service provision (n = 22). While 
most of the participants had their training four months prior to the interview, 
over a third of them (35.6%; n = 37) had already organized mental health 
awareness-raising meetings. Participants in the qualitative interviews 
considered the problem of child mental disorders to be widespread and to cause a 
large burden to the family and the affected children. They reported that 
improving their competence and knowledge was important to address the problem 
and to tackle stigma and discrimination. Participants also listed some barriers 
for service provision, including lack of competence, stigma and institutional 
constraints. Opportunities mentioned included staff commitment, high levels of 
interest and a positive attitude towards providing the service.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the HEAT training on child mental health was brief, it 
appears to have had some impact in improving knowledge and care provision. If 
the key barriers to service provision are addressed and supported by policy 
guidance, community health workers may contribute substantially in addressing 
the treatment gap for children with mental health needs.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in simple molecular biomarkers for 
biological aging. Age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes at specific CG 
dinucleotides can be combined into epigenetic age predictors to estimate 
chronological age-and the deviation of chronological and predicted age (∆age) 
seems to be associated with all-cause mortality. In this study, we have further 
validated this association and analyzed whether or not individual age-associated 
CG-dinucleotides (CpGs) are related to life expectancy.
FINDINGS: In the German ESTHER cohort, we used 864 DNAm profiles of blood 
samples as the discovery set and 1000 DNAm profiles as the validation set to 
predict chronological age with three previously reported age predictors-based on 
99, 71, or 353 age-associated CpGs. Several of these individual CpGs were 
significantly associated with life expectancy, and for some of these CpGs, this 
was even reproducible in the independent datasets. Notably, those CpGs that 
revealed significant association with life expectancy were overall rather 
hypomethylated upon aging.
CONCLUSION: Individual age-associated CpGs may provide biomarkers for all-cause 
mortality-but confounding factors need to be critically taken into 
consideration, and alternative methods, which facilitate more quantitative 
measurements at individual CpGs, might be advantageous. Our data suggest that 
particularly specific CpGs that become hypomethylated upon aging are indicative 
of biological aging.

Erythropoietin (EPO) is the principal hormone which, has somewhat short 
half-life involved in the differentiation and regulation of circulating red 
blood cells. The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of a 
polyethylene glycol mimetic technology as a biological alternative to improve 
pharmaceutical properties of human recombinant EPO. In silico models of EPO 
fused to 200 amino acids of proline, alanine, and serine (PAS) were initially 
generated and assessed by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The fluctuations of 
the modeled structure reached a plateau after 6000 ps of MD simulation. The Phi 
and psi analysis showed >99.2% of residues were located in the allowed regions. 
An expression vector consisting of EPO cDNA tagged to PAS coding sequences was 
synthesized and expressed in CHO-K1 Cells. The produced PASylated molecule was 
purified and characterized by standard analytical methods. The molecular weight 
of fusion protein was expanded to 70 kDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method. Analytical size exclusion 
chromatography revealed an approximately sevenfold increase in apparent size of 
produced protein. Although the in vitro potency of the fusion protein was 
significantly reduced (1.26 ± 0.05 vs. 0.24 ± 0.03 ng/ml) but, the in vivo 
activity was considerably increased up to 1.58 × 105 IU/ml in normocythemic mice 
assay. Pharmacokinetic animal studies revealed strongly 15.6-fold plasma 
half-life extension for the PASylated EPO (83.16 ± 13.28 h) in comparison to 
epoetin α (8.5 ± 2.4 h) and darbepoetin α (25.3 ± 2.2h).

PURPOSE: This study assessed the uptake of the CONsolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT)-Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) statement; determined 
if use of CONSORT-PRO was associated with more complete reporting of PRO 
endpoints in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and identified the extent to 
which high-impact journals publishing RCTs with PRO endpoints endorse 
CONSORT-PRO.
METHODS: CONSORT-PRO citations were identified by systematically searching 
Medline, EMBASE and Google from 2013 (year CONSORT-PRO released) to 17 December 
2015. RCTs that cited CONSORT-PRO (cases) were compared to a comparable control 
sample of RCTs in terms of adherence to CONSORT-PRO using t tests. General 
linear models assessed the relationship between CONSORT-PRO score and key, 
pre-specified variables. The 100 highest-impact journals that published RCTs 
with PRO endpoints (2014-2015) were identified via a systematic Medline search. 
Instructions for authors were reviewed to determine whether journals endorsed 
CONSORT-PRO.
RESULTS: Total CONSORT-PRO scores ranged from 47 to 100% for cases and 25-96% 
for controls. Cases had significantly higher total CONSORT-PRO scores compared 
to controls: t = 2.64, p = 0.01. 'Citing CONSORT-PRO', 'journal endorsing 
CONSORT-PRO' and 'dedicated PRO paper' were significant predictors of higher 
CONSORT-PRO adherence score: R 2 = 0.48, p < 0.001. 11/100 top-ranked journals 
endorsed CONSORT-PRO in their instructions to authors, seven of these journals 
published RCTs included as cases in this study.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated improved PRO reporting associated with 
journal endorsement and author use of the CONSORT-PRO extension. Despite growing 
awareness, more work is needed to promote appropriate use of CONSORT-PRO to 
improve completeness of reporting; in particular, stronger journal endorsement 
of CONSORT-PRO.

Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a chronic, slowly progressive, autosomal-dominant 
disorder with delayed muscle relaxation after contraction, distal skeletal 
muscle weakness, and atrophy. It has a reduced life expectancy due predominantly 
to respiratory failure or sudden cardiac death. The mortality rate is 
approximately 7.3 times greater than the general population with a mean age at 
death of 53 years. Degeneration of the cardiac conduction system causes 
atrioventricular block, arrhythmias, and ventricular failure. A case of sudden 
death in a 44-year-old woman with DM type 1 is reported to demonstrate an 
alternative lethal mechanism. At autopsy, there was extensive infiltration of 
skeletal muscles with adipose tissue. The heart was structurally normal. A deep 
venous thrombosis of the right calf was identified with a large saddle pulmonary 
thromboembolus and bilateral peripheral thromboemboli. DM1-related thrombosis 
had most likely occurred because of the decedent's impaired mobility, possible 
hypercoagulable state, and serum changes from muscle necrosis.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare genetic disorder with life-limiting 
pathology. Drisapersen induces exon 51 skipping, thereby producing a shorter but 
functional dystrophin protein. The longest available data are from an open-label 
extension study (PRO051-02) treating 12 boys with drisapersen (6 mg/kg/week 
subcutaneously). The median change (range) from baseline to week 177 in 
six-minute walking distance (6MWD) was 8 (-263, 163) metres. The current 
analysis aimed to put the results from PRO051-02 in the context of natural 
progression by comparing the functional trajectory of drisapersen-treated 
subjects to a matched natural history (NH) cohort, treated by standard of care. 
Subjects were matched individually by age and 6MWD, as the primary analysis, and 
by age and rise from floor (RFF), as sensitivity analysis. A total of 75 NH 
subjects were available for 6MWD analysis, of which matching was possible for 9 
ambulant drisapersen-treated subjects. None of the 6 "stable" (baseline 6MWD 
≥330 metres) drisapersen-treated subjects lost ambulation vs 4 out of 10 matched 
NH subjects over a comparable timeframe (~3.4 years), compared with 2 out of 3 
ambulant "in decline" drisapersen-treated subjects vs all 6 matched NH subjects. 
A total of 79 NH subjects were available for RFF analysis. For continuous 
ambulatory subjects (N = 4), the RFF decline was more pronounced in the NH 
cohort than in the drisapersen-treated subjects. In conclusion, a comparison of 
ambulant drisapersen-treated subjects with matched NH subjects showed a 
difference in functional trajectories over a timeframe of up to 3.4 years in 
favour of drisapersen.

INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent malignant tumour of 
the central nervous system, and its incidence reaches 80% in those over 50 years 
of age. Life expectancy has increased in the population in recent times and an 
analysis of the post-surgical complications affecting elderly patients is of 
great importance for a correct surgical indication.
AIMS: To analyse the factors related with post-surgical complications in elderly 
patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sample of 88 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma 
multiforme between 31 and 78 years of age was analysed retrospectively. The 
variables taken into consideration in the study were: personal medical history, 
age, functional status, pre-anaesthetic status, tumour characteristics, type of 
surgery and post-surgical complications.
RESULTS: Age was observed to have an influence on local (p = 0.006) and systemic 
surgical complications (p = 0.034), and on the Clavien-Dindo scale (p = 0.001). 
Persons with a poorer functional status and cardiovascular risk presented more 
systemic complications (p = 0.006 and 0.044) and a lower score on the 
Clavien-Dindo scale (p = 0.024 and 0.025) respectively. Likewise, more local 
complications are found in the case of excisional procedures than in biopsies (p 
= 0.027). The pre-anaesthetic status and anti-haemostatic treatments were not 
related with such events.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients over 65 years of age present a higher incidence of 
pathological antecedents and a poorer pre-surgical functional status. Age, 
cardiovascular risk, functional status and the type of surgical procedure have 
significantly increased the occurrence of post-surgical complications.
